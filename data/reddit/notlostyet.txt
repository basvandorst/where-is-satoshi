You don't pay CGT until you cash out. If you want to avoid CGT entirely you can even just cash out less than your CGT annual allowance in gains per year. 
E.g. if I bought £100 of Bitcoin at £10/coin, and sell now at £400 your gain is only £3900, and you won't pay a penny to the taxman provided you've made no other capital gains this year.

They wouldn't need to host anything. Bitcoin clients are currently hard-coded to accept a block reward scheme. Distributed clients can be programmed to believe whatever they want, all that matters is the block chain as a whole brings about a high level of agreement. There's no technical problem with stripping distributed mining out of Bitcoin and replacing it with trust in a 'central mine' like the Fed - nodes would still participate in the network to harvest transaction fees we'd just have a different minting process.


This makes no sense. If the Fed pegged "FedECash" to the USD then rationally people could accept FedECash with the *same* confidence as they do the USD. 


They wouldn't need to muscle acceptance, being pegged to the USD would be attractive enough. There would be no need to accept it as legal tender any more than you will find it convenient to pay your taxes in T-Bills.


Nothing I suggested would mandate that the Fed had any control or means to intervene in transactions any more than you can stop transactions in the Bitcoin block chain.


You're assuming to gouge you is what they want. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence. You're clearly of the libertarian fairy ilk in this regard. This is fine, but there's no reason that the  system can't be engineered to allow Government issue while *maintaining* many advantages of Bitcoin.
Have you forgotten it was a branch of the US DoD that helped to distribute computers in such a way that they became what we now call the Internet? What about Tor which exists because of research done by the US Navy?
Not everything Government does is inherently evil or exists to strip away your liberties.


No, it's clearly not the best they can do. I was proposing a decentralised digital crypto-currency with centralised minting as an alternative to cash. That's entirely possible, and completely different to a bank account.

You need to generate a ~~nonce~~ salt and publish hmac(~~nonce~~ salt, secret) to prove that you've already selected a secret.
At the moment your anti-cheat proposal allows you to submit a bet for yourself and then generate a secret that satisfies hmac(txid + secret) = your selection, which would take no time at all.
You could use the last block hash as your ~~nonce~~ salt, that way you only accept bets/transactions in later blocks, and if you publish winning bets we can all verify that the block existed before you decided upon a secret.

It will be almost impossible to enforce. Unlike drugs you can trade bitcoin on your cell phone or on paper like cash with negligible risk of being busted. Even if they shut down the fiat exchanges (difficult as they can be operated from any country in the world) trade against other virtual currencies, retail vouchers, or any other fungible semi-anonymous commodity will still occur.
Of course, without fiat exchanges the whole market would become much less efficient and volatile making it useless for legitimate business use.

It's an insurance scheme. You effectively deposit, say, 100 BTC with Pirate who pays you 7 BTC per week. You then give a chunk of that interest (1.5 BTC) to this guy who would have reimbursed you with your 100 BTC principal if Pirate ran off with your cash.
The actual bond structure is more subtle. To simplify the process this guy acted as an intermediary, taking your money and investing with Pirate. The advantage of this is he doesn't have to bother chasing the weekly 1.5 BTC payment from you or his other clients. He just collects the 7 BTC from Pirate, skims it, and sends it to you. Most importantly, this ensures you actually have an [insurable interest]( in Pirates fund and that you're not just trying to speculate on its collapse (so this is not a [Naked CDS](
He also charged a 55% non-refundable premium, up front, which means for the first 10 weeks you effectively make nothing from the Pirate interest payments (55%/5.5% = 10)
Chaang Noi was therefore exposed by 45% had Pirate defaulted immediately, but under ideal conditions he could clear that exposure in just 19 weeks:
* He can invest up to 25% of the 55% premium ("75% of the insurance money will not be loaned or invested.").
* He can reinvest his 1.5% share of the dividend on principal, and the full 7% dividend on premium, and benefit from compound investment.
     Per week (all % of face value): 
     7% x (1 + 55% x 25%) = 7.9625% returned to Chang
     5.5% is paid to clients, leaving an additional 2.4625% in the Pirate fund.
     1 - (75% x  55%) = 58.75% needs to be earned before he's unexposed
     1.024625^x = 1.5875
     solve for x
     x = 19 weeks
Honestly, that does seem a long time to expose yourself. I wouldn't be surprised if he was paying the 5.5% out of the 55% premium, didn't invest at all, and was in cahoots with Pirate to ensure a default happened long before 10 weeks.

1. I never said anything about a fork of Bitcoin. I said a "crypto-**cash**-currency". I've detailed over our many posts how block rewards, for instance, would have to go...I think this makes it pretty clear I'm not talking about a "fork".
2. I never said it would "destroy" Bitcoin. I said it would "probably crush Bitcoin in measure of legitimate business adoption and Joe Average getting on board."


How is it unspecified? Block reward on every Nth block to give constant inflation, all proceeds go to the central reserve imbued with the responsibility of maintaining relative price stability (which is one of the Feds primary mandates).


Every Ecash coin purchased (initially from the Fed, of course) would cost $1. So they could always have 100% reserve of USD for every Ecash coin in circulation. Of course if there was exceptionally high demand for Ecash then their reserves could be drained and the demand couldn't be satisfied, but one assumes that high demand for an Ecash currency supposedly pegged 1:1 with the USD would only be because it served utility (because it's be useless as a hedge from the USD) ...so more coins would be generated in response to transaction volume going up. This is no different to how our economy currently works, it's money flowing through the banking system systemically that creates the illusion of more currency than 'actually exists' through the wonders of FRB. Our current system assumes this flow of money broadly corresponds to added-value in the economy and the Fed is supposed to keep their foot on the hose by manipulating interest rates.
Look it's not perfect, I'm not as smart as Satoshi, but clearly you can't have a federally backed crypto-currency that passes out free money pseduo-randomly like Bitcoin does to miners. That was necessary for Bitcoin (to incentivize people to use it by eliminating transaction fees) but people in the fiat world are already relatively comfortable with paying fees, and the backing of the Fed could be enough to spur interest.
What's stopping the Fed selling Bitcoin at $1? That's impossible because the supply of Bitcoin can never exceed 21M to satisfy demand. The only way they could accomplish this is make the USD more scarce/expensive to maintain the peg. My proposal would be inflationary like all the fiat currencies we have today and it would be *much* easier to maintain a fixed peg (even if not 1:1) because it's a closed system.
What most sensible Libbies want is for the Fed to be restricted in terms of printing, but, for the most part, to  maintain their monopoly on being the currency of choice in the USA, and having world reserve status.

It's an interesting idea...but I'm not sure how you can resolve the apparent incompatibility between pseudo-anonymity and credit. How can you establish credit worthiness in a peer to peer fashion? Just based on your track record or some rating system? Even if that works, how do newbies gets credit?... by lending before they can borrow?
Also, what's the point of it all? Do people even *want* to transact this way? How is the money supply going to be  measured? Will there be an M0 and M1? How is interest managed? 
Doesn't the "chain of trusted intermediaries" pose an increased risk of default? If there's a 1% random default rate, then a chain of 5 lenders means there is a 5% chance of default (1 - 0.99^5 ). That's too high.

You need a secure web connection as well, although I'm sure a send-only client could use a low powered machine like an Arduino and a SIM to connect over 3G. You still need to pay someone to go around and empty (cash) and refill (ink, repairs, receipts) the machines though so it's going to have noticeable costs.
Given the costs, what's the use-case? When would you want to convert fiat paper or coin to bitcoin-on-paper? Cash deposits at banks are available to spend instantly and you can then logon to an exchange and buy some BTC with your debit card. The only time this makes sense is when you come across a street retailer who will only accept BTC and/or you have no Internet access or access to your Bitcoin wallets.

The system would merely award coins to the central reserve (Fed) on every Nth block generated, giving you steady inflation. The system would still be verified in distributed fashion and the Fed have no imposition over transactions, which would be accepted and hashed in to blocks by participants in order to harvest transaction fees - basically the same way Bitcoin will exist after all 21 million coins have been mined.
The real innovation of Bitcoin is maintaining a chain of transactions agreed upon by a set of distributed participants using proof of work, which eliminates the need for a central ledger. Mining is not a particularly interesting or crucial aspect of the Bitcoin network, it's just a novel way to disseminate the coins without a central mint or reserve.

At this point, I think that level of cunning gives him far too much credit. 
@_date: 2012-09-02 18:09:23
A slow and steady rate of inflation (e.g. 2%/year) encourages investment, lending (e.g. through bank deposits) or spending (buy while stuff is still cheap) rather than stuffing it in your mattress. In short, it helps keep the economy liquid.
Our current economy relies on the principle that each $, £ or € in circulation can be used *simultaneously* by multiple people at once (through lending and fractional reserve banking) which means less real money needs to be put in to circulation by the central bank to maintain relative price stability...that is, until the banks stop lending.
So to answer your question, it has nothing to do with "value", it's just the mechanics of the financial system in which we live. This entirely ancillary to whatever you believe "value" actually is.

The walls aren't keeping the price down. If anything large buy orders (people bidding for, or offering to buy, BTC) are helping to keep the price *up*.
These bid walls force others who want to purchase small and infrequent quantities of Bitcoin to offer more US dollars to stand any chance of getting them. Sellers (e.g. retailers) who need to sell coin see these offers (and walls) and set their prices accordingly, but people speculating on the value of BTC rising have no reason to sell.
Scaremongering started when Pirate said he has enough coins to take the price on MtGox down to between $1 and $2. Atm, assuming it's not all bullshit, that would take ~300,000 BtC, less any he's bidding on himself (which would require tying up US$)

Transaction fees are awarded *per block* just like block rewards. More transactions *per block* = higher reward for (roughly) the same expenditure (the memory and disk overhead compared to the hashing cost is negligible at the higher difficulty levels). 
All that would happen is blocks would become larger...and this is expected to happen anyway as transaction volume increases due to the 1 block / 10 minute constraint on the network.
And let's not forget that a crypto-cash-currency pegged to the USD and endorsed by the Fed would see an extremely high transaction volume.


Except it wouldn't because, even in dire times, the difficulty would be reduced automatically to maintain the 1 block per 10 minute rate.


Your saying retailers like Amazon and sellers on eBay *like* charging their customers fees? 


Now you're being deliberately silly. How do you pay your bills with cash or any other payment method? 


Who cares? Seriously, Bitcoin already poses a threat to traditional payment solutions and those who derive profit from them. I'm not suggesting the Fed should hold a monopoly on crypto-currency like they do bank notes.


I never said they can mint 'freely'. If you read my last reply I said they would grow their reserves based on some fixed network function (Nth block is just one idea). You realise a classical reserve bank exists to maintain reserves, right?

It should be noted that if you buy on MtGox in GBP£  that there's roughly a 2-3% hit on the spread compared to what US$ traders get...
Example (current as of posting):
    Current exchange rate (from XE.com): 1.61121 USD/GBP
    Lowest US ask price: $11.20000
    Lowest GBP ask price: £7.16254
    
    £7.16254 * 1.61121 = $11.54 
    $11.20 / $11.54 = 97% = US buyers get Bitcoin 3% cheaper.
I've found this to be the case at all times. My guess is that MtGox do for-ex so they can match UK buyers with US$ sellers.  Something to bare in mind when deciding on an exchange.

True, but Gold isn't seriously being hyped as an alternative currency like Bitcoin has been. In short, everybody knows there is no 'gold economy' and so there is *no reason to speculate* using gold, unless you're hedging against fiat inflation or the collapse of a fiat economy and a return to the gold standard. This means more or less everybody, except the Austrian School folks, are happy to just stick in it a drawer somewhere and can reasonably expect that, given the historical record of stable supply and demand, prices relative to other stable assets will remain stable. 
With Bitcoin on the other hand, there's no certainty at all surrounding the economy because the best thing that seems to have come out of it not directly imported from fiatland is r/girlsgonebitcoin.

There are a bunch of reasons you don't want to do that:
* it limits your service to fixed-size transactions.
* if there's a market shift you either won't sell all or any of your wallets (which will ruin you) or an arbitrageur will come along and buy the lot, meaning you'll be restocking the machine every 5 minutes.
* it effectively doubles your exposure to theft - anybody who breaks in to the machine can take all of the wallet keys.
The only advantage I can think of, other than it being totally offline, is you also wouldn't need a printer (wallet slips can be pre-printed and spooled).
The third option is to make the availability of funds in the BTC wallets non-instant and only stock wallets after the machine has been checked, but that inconvenience devalues the service.

The problem with throwing out the transaction history is that to be able to verify the validity of a payment that you've received you need to be able to refer to an arbitrary set of past payments *that the sender themselves received*. This verification has to go all the way back until you hit a set of fully spent transactions.
You have absolutely no way of knowing which transactions a sender will choose to redeem when he sends you money, so you have to keep all of them. Anyone sending you money could very well redeem an unspent input from 2 years ago, despite having received a bunch of other transactions since. It's their choice.
You cannot create a database of just wallet addresses and balances, because without a record of previous transactions you'd still have no way of knowing whether a transaction you received in the blockchain was valid in the sense that it avoided double-spending, even though you could prove that it was correctly signed.

Can you explain this further?
N miners generate a hash, each with a probability, P, of hitting some target.
The probability of every single miner *not* hitting the target is (1 - P)^N. If they generated 1 hash per second then the probability of no block being generated after 1 second is surely then (1 - P)^N and the probability of no block being generated inside t seconds is ( (1 - P)^N )^t or (1-P)^Nt ?
How do we get from here to e^4?
If you let x = the (1 - P)^N guff, then surely x^600 = 0.5 and x^2400 = therefore 1/16th.

I don't subscribe to either philosophy. I just think people under estimate the effects of human psychology in pricing and personally find it difficult to imagine a world where we have a fixed monetary supply.

@_date: 2012-07-26 00:12:41
Bah, out of my league. I thought (1-P)^Nt was already cumulative. If there's a P probability of something occuring in each second, then after 5 the probability that it hasn't occured is (1 - P)^5. The probability of it having occured in less than or equal to t seconds is therefore 1 - (1 - P)^t.

No, saving and investing is *not* inherently speculative. 
Speculation is investing based on hypothesis and indicators of *change*, which are open to interpretation, rather than methodical assessment of value and a presumption of *stability*. 
Like all investments, speculative investments are always made with incomplete information but speculators  deliberately disregard 'known unknowns', rather than just accepting the possibility of, and risk inherent to, 'unknown unknowns'.

I don't know where you get "refused to listen", she publishes articles for on-line magazines she's not making a blog post - it's intended to be a one way medium and I doubt she participates.
I would argue she's avoided the most common (and incorrect) criticisms of Bitcoin and seems to have focused on the practical aspects of *using it*.

The idea that any government will attempt to shut down Bitcoin simply because it could threaten the traditional currency model is paranoid fantasy. They'll almost certainly go after tax-evaders (most likely through collaboration with ISPs), and extend money laundering regulations to ensure distributed crypto-currencies are covered, but think about it... why would they want to shut down a system that's *less* anonymous than cash?
If people start using the likes of Tor to anonymize their transactions then the precedent set by Wikileaks suggests embargos on the fiat exchanges and companies like BitInstant would be the first port of call in order to choke off liquidity.
In any case, why fight and risk driving BTC underground when you can compete and then tarnish the competition as a harbourer of illicit activity? Personally, I think the likely eventual response to Bitcoins success would be a Fed endorsed crypto-cash-currency, exchangeable like Bitcoin but pegged to the $... and, despite what all the libertarian fairies like to think, such a thing would probably crush Bitcoin in measure of legitimate business adoption and Joe Average getting on board.

No *individual* bank lends out more than it takes in on deposit, or in on loan from other banks. The multiplicative effect on the money supply you're trying to convey comes from the systemic nature of the fractions you lend out being redeposited at *another* bank, which has no idea the money is on loan, and then being held in reserve and lent out again.
This is what economists mean by 'monetising debt' or 'most of the money in circulation is debt', but your high street bank does *not* just print money. 
Fractional reserve banking is possible even on a Gold standard.
@_date: 2012-07-28 19:43:46
MtGox essentially does this between their own exchanges. Orders placed on the USD/BTC are priced up to account for a 2% forex fee and re-offered on the GBP/BTC and other currency exchanges. This helps to improve liquidity.

OK, so the idea is that it'll be like BitTorrent but peer A will refuse to send to peer B if peer C, and the rest of the network, agrees that A doesn't seed enough? 
An extension to the DHT protocol used by popular Bittorrent clients to achieve preferential transfers based on this idea might be interesting. I like the idea of seeders as miners of download allowance.
Also, it seems to me that the encryption of the actual data being shared only serves to stop peers being biased toward serving particular types of content - is that the idea? The issue of privacy seems otherwise disconnected from the the protocol (just like Tor)

True, this makes more sense in parimutuel betting rather than fixed odds, but you can still gain by deciding who wins and who doesn't. 
For instance, if you've had a harsh run of variance you can just make everybody lose for a while, or make bigger bets lose more often than smaller bets. If you give proof of your secret first and disclose it afterwards nobody can say you're unfair.
You can also use fixing winners as a way to create an effective laundering/mixing service and collect fees on the side:
1. Person A bets a bunch of coin and you make sure he loses everything.
2. Person B bets a bunch of coin and you make sure he wins whatever A lost, less a laundering/mixing fee.
3. The whole thing looks like chance.

Yeah, it's bullshit. Just a few milliseconds  of network latency make brute force completely infeasible even for pretty weak keys of that description.
Looking at the LR API it looks like [replay attacks could be an issue]( (no nonce or challenge-response mechanism is used), so if somebody intercepts traffic they *can* perform arbitrary transactions... but everything is supposed to happen over HTTPS so that seems extremely unlikely.
Database or LR client server compromised is the only reasonable explanation.

They'd get the transaction fees. Just like they do now. You realise Bitcoin transactions will one day cease to become free, right?


Actually I think it's your ignorance. The Bitcoin network will stop producing coins after 21M have been mined, after which transaction fees will replace block rewards as an incentive to participate in the block chain and transactions will become steadily more expensive as volume increases and participate nodes prioritise the most lucrative transactions. This will be a gradual process as the reward/difficulty ratio becomes prohibitively expensive.

Umm, i thought our entire discussion was about crypto-cash-currency as a potential replacement for cash, which has no central ledger? i guess you misinterpreted what I said in my very first post.
The Fed has no ledger of person to person transactions taking place with Federal Reserve Notes. 
Stop talking about ledgers, it's not relevant to this topic.


By this reasoning Bitcoin will also be at risk of a 51% attack when the block reward goes to ~0. You clearly haven't taken on board my previous post about increased transaction volume meaning a greater hash requirement to harvest tx fees yet...


Incentive? They can't be seen to be extending their monopoly on the banking system. They don't have to support ANY infrastructure themselves. None, nothing. It's cheaper than paper. Everyone has equal and transparent access to the blockchain...a great step forward in transparent markets and governance. Need I go on?


I'd trade it for something else with someone else interested in your 100% reserve 1:1 backed dollars. As a bonus I'll cut them in 50/50 on the 2nd dollar you just promised. You'll soon be bankrupt, but other than that I have no ideia what this analogy has to do with crypto-currencies.
Look the long and short of this discussion is that Bitcoin is not the be-all-and-end-all of crypto-currencies. More will follow, and I personally suspect one day we'll see a government backed crypto-currency. We'll see if I'm right before we both die, but we don't need to continue this discussion until we're in our graves.

Transactions are actually kept in a hash tree, which allows nodes to discard transactions in the chain if they decide they aren't relevant and don't need to be kept. For example, because the point of the Block Chain is to prevent double *spending* and transactions cannot be reversed, you can safely discard all previous transactions pertaining to empty wallets.
to quote the original Satoshi paper:


it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.
Clients don't yet implement this but if they want desktop users to continue using it they probably should, given the BC is close to 2 GiB

You're confusing speculation and the consideration of risk.
Speculative investments are made because of some assumption about either the superior performance of an  investment, or the poor state of the alternatives (hedging).
The 'strength of the dollar' is called inflation, which I mentioned. You can measure the price of real goods and services in dollars over time and decide whether your savings are keeping pace with inflation - if you hadn't noticed most people move their savings around in this reactive, rather than speculative, manner. In fact, most people will save at 5% rather than stick it in their mattress at 0% without even considering inflation because there is more value to banking than just appreciation.
In the UK many people invested in the Icelandic bank IceSave (Google it) because it paid higher rates than domestic banks. That was a risk but it wasn't speculation, it was merely a reaction to the fact that IceSave paid higher rates. Now those people took a risk, they weren't smart investors, but they didn't consciously bet on the Icelandic economy being any more successful than the UKs, or any UK banks collapsing, when they made that decision.

You're missing the point. In our economy a central bank creates some arbitrary amount of currency which is used to facilitate exchange of valuable goods, services and debts thereof. Banks, and the central bank in particular, then attempt to limit the multiplicative effect of monetised debt by managing interest rates and expanding or contracting the monetary supply.
In Ripple, what prevents anyone from arbitrarily offering someone else a line of credit of 1 trillion coins? Where does the monetary supply come from if it's not printed or mined? What makes this guy think anyone will treat it seriously enough to assign any inherent value to it? How is the currency even denominated? What sets the baseline?
What I'm saying is, I don't think you can quantify trust in such abstract terms, it's too personal to propagate through a network of strangers imho.

MtGox *could* offer more security options. An option to have all withdrawals confirmed manually via a link sent to your email address would be helpful in some cases. For large withdrawals (perhaps for a threshold set by you) they could ask for extra ID (passport number or such).

You'd think if people believed that it will fall that it *would* be falling. That's how markets work under speculation. That may not be true in the case of BTC though.
Bitcoin is a pissant economy akin to a barren unregulated country with no industry. Most users only import and export their wealth because they can use it as a way of transferring fiat between more developed nations cheaply and relatively anonymously, and only a handful of people are smart/stupid/brave enough to camp out in the desert and wait for Vegas to be built. 
At the moment, prevailing sentiment seems to be that the shores may be dominated by certain Pirates trying to limit how much you can import and export

This makes sense.
- Revoluts raison d'etre is *instant*, low fee, exchange between currencies. If they don't hold the private keys to any Bitcoin holdings (or have a contract with a 3rd party exchange that does), then they simply can't offer  this.
- You can't withdraw or deposit all the fiat currencies they hold either.
- It's potentially an ideal platform for fast, convenient, trades  while you're on the move (not everyone sits at their PC all the time obsessively following the market).
- As long as their liabilities are covered, and you trust them, it doesn't really matter... and, *presumably*, if you're a Revolut user already, then you *already trust them* with your fiat.
- Avoiding external (blockchain) inflows and outflows no doubt massively simplifies, and reduces the cost of, complying with money transmitter/laundering regulations.
- Revoluts whole business model seems to be on providing the app after a 2 minute sign-up (no ID required), and offloading services to partners. See their mobile phone insurance and pension offerings.
- Do you really want to carry BTC around on your phone in any easily extractable fashion only protected by a 4 digit PIN?

Banks pool deposits and spread default risk so people can get loans. Sure there are P2P loan schemes in existence already, like Zopa, but centralised trusted organisations need to exist whether you're on a Gold standard or fiat or Bitcoin.

His rationale is sound though. The market cap of Bitcoin currently quoted on Blockchain.info is ~$75M USD. It seems unlikely, to me, that the local Bitcoin economy can justify that valuation. There simply aren't enough goods and services not tied tangibly to fiat currency. Most Bitcoin activity seems to be financial sector shenanigans atm. 
To make up the shortfall I have to conclude that a buttload of BTC are economically dormant (not being transacted) and at some point, assuming the economy hasn't grown  substantially, they'll be dumped for other currencies causing a crash in valuation against fiat. Even if I'm wrong about the market cap valuation, we're not even out of the mining stage yet and the money supply has yet to *double*.
Another strong indicator for me is the estimated profits people are making mining coins  - ~50% based on just energy costs. At this stage, factoring in other economic activities and other mining costs, I don't think the valuation of the currency should be much more than it is now. Of course, the cost of mining is set to rise and that may be priced in.
So in short my opinion is that we're more likely to see substantial price inflation long long before we see deflation due to simple money supply constraints.

Yeah, by Kelly you'll need ~4x the bankroll to deal with 1 zero and la partage, or reduce the max payout by the same factor.
Coincidentally, what happens if an unusual number of 0.2 BTC bets from different wallets come in on the same number? Won't you still go broke? ;). It seems to me that a table limit is pointless when people can create unlimited wallets. Satoshi Dice doesn't have this problem because each transaction is a different random roll and there is no player choice.
Aren't you going to stop taking bets and spin the wheel once your maximum potential exposure limit is reached?

 HTTP redirects are insecure. If they want to do this then they should also use [HTTP Strict Transport Security]( and consider requesting that Google and Mozilla add them to their respective built-in lists. Just reduce the plain HTTP page to a holding/explanatory page.

Cryptography has seen wider use since 1974, and even since 1990. In those days it had less use in private enterprise... now cryptography is part of the backbone in a trillion $ industry. I would *like* to think the amount of academic and private attention cryptography gets these days means we've narrowed the gap considerably.

Adding Bitcoin wallets to PayPal makes sense. They already offer multi-currency wallets and exchange. 
The question is, will they offer Bitcoin withdrawals as well as deposits? I suspect not.

Hmm interesting. The lack of a 'change set' does seem like a disadvantage. I don't share the authors prognosis that timerfd(), signalfd() are inelegant though. I can see how it adds to complexity in the kernel, but I think it simplifies well abstracted userland code.
Edit: just found [a nice comparison of libevent and libev]( It's old but the still relevant afaict to stable libevent 2.0.x versions. Joyents libuv (Unix backend is libev) seems to growing in popularity as well.

Your transactions aren't public unless people know which (public) key belongs to you.

Sure, but you need *something* for browsers that don't support HSTS (IE, Opera). 


HSTS is a hack, but it's a lot better than an automatic redirect. Web security is fundamentally tricky, always will be... the web just wasn't built with privacy in mind.

It's irrelevant at the end of the day. If someone MITMs the site then you're still going to be going over HTTPS and see the padlock etc. The certificate will just change. You really need certificate pinning *as well*.

That graph seems to demonstrate that epoll and kqueue both scale in the same way. Epoll has slightly higher constant factor overhead, but it doesn't look significant.

These are [binary options]( which are equivalent to fixed odds bets (like [PP was offering](
e.g. At the time of writing (market suspended) the "Bitcoin to be above $100" market has a Sell - Buy spread of 84.0 - 94.0.
Equivalent American odds:
    Bitcoin to be  &gt; $100   -1567  (risk $1567 to win $100)
    Bitcoin to be &lt;= $100   +525   (risk $100 to win $525)
Roughly a 10% book.

I disagree. Pretty much everything on blockchain.info is potentially sensitive. Just looking up a block could indicate that one of the transactions within it could belong to you. The sensitive services seem to outweigh the public ones.

Yep and, even at a lowly 5 Mh/J, Bitcoin is still trading at something like 40x costs, so GPU mining amongst enthusiasts, who will be buying cards anyway, isn't going anywhere. It's the payback time the cost of the cards themselves which will kill it for most.

Erm... they haven't cancelled any bets, they just took down the market. It's completely normal for a bookmaker to take down a long-term market when their book needs reshaping. There's nothing here at all to suggest they won't be offering similar markets in the future. 
And I suspect PP just have a small exposure limit set on the market - it's in the novelty category. They're also notoriously shit, limiting their customers to small bets very quickly.
What Bitcoin needs is a strong derivatives market, not toy bookmakers making headlines

What Bitcoins? You deposit your coin, they process them using Bitpay, and then credit your account with fiat. This is all, I suspect, we can expect.

They won't fail specifically because they're centralised, they'll fail because offering the free exchange of anonymous (or pseudo-anonymous) digital cash is a legislative and PR minefield *for* a central entity.
There are centrally issued anonymous digital cash schemes that could work in combination with a distributed ledger, or via third parties or offline exchange, there's just no incentive for anyone, corporate or government, to take that risk. It's just easier to comply with regulation with a wallet scheme akin to PayPal.

It looks like they sniffed him out by looking back at old Internet records (forum posts, IPs etc) from around the time of SRs appearance. The first person to ever advertise SR was DPR himself, and he used an email account attached to his natural born identity. No NSA or technical hack.

I work this out to be about 180 Mhash/J, which is 80-100x more energy efficient than any GPU mining.
Also, for anyone wondering, at current difficulty and rate of exchange, this will cost you less than $0.10 a day to run and generate $40 of Bitcoin.
