If you can buy a Trezor, you wont regret it (uses segwit addresses). As soon as I got mine I felt instantly better than my old paper wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:21:47
Oh yes. Either is excellent (I only have a trezor myself but I hear ledgers are better in some ways).

Most people here have done royally out of bitcoin and look forward to a borderless future for money. You don't actually care whether anyone loses anything. Like you are here to 'warn' us. As if. Give me a break.

People are going to do fraudulent things. Take the banks that caused the 2007-8 Global Financial Crisis. Take the cocaine trade that was all done in USD up until recently. You can't have people involved without fraud. Technology can't to criminal things, it's neutral. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:22:11
Exactly. I can say that 'our economy is in a bubble' whenever it's going well and sound like I have some insight into the financial markets. Meaningless babble is what it is.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:25:26
You won't regret it. If you are in the USA I think they are $80 or so (was $220 AUD for me iirc). It's nice being able to send multiple coins (and Erc20 tokens) to one device, That has been the main bonus. A paper wallet is a hassle to re-do if you move coins and you feel very, very exposed at the moment you scan the private key if there is a high value there. Not a nice feeling.
The down side is that it makes moving coins so easy that you get tempted to swap/sell coins. 
Pro tip: make a password backup seed (like I didn't) I ended up buying a combination safe to put it in for fear of compromise (rather than re-do the setup, I sort of needed one anyway).

I think you're right. At this point it's just a collective slide as people try to hang on to recent gains. As soon as the price goes up consistently the price will follow as people buy back in. Without a big news story there's no reason to crash other than sheep trading.

Lightning network is available on testnet now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:04:29
The way I understand it, if bitcoin scaled the blocksize to suit global adoption then you'd need terabyte blocks every second. It doesn't work. Lightning is our best bet right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:11
It's also a fair amount of speculation. With Lightning Network close to release, I would be betting on bitcoin as the long term and this forked coin BCC as more of a novelty. But I hodl both so I'm ok either way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:13:31
Kind of. Rather than try to explain it and correct you there's more here 
Long story short, if it works then scaling problems are solved and fees go back to small amounts.

I transferred all of my Satoshis to my trezor about a week ago. It was a little scary getting coins from my paper wallet and exposing my private keys. So I added a bit to the transaction to see it go through straight away (not that it would have made a difference but it meant I wasn't waiting).

I've been involved since 2012 and this correction was bound to happen. Enjoying watching it.
Too much new money getting in on wanting profit. Bitcoin is in a bad way until the lightning network comes in but it's still healthy in terms of speculation. Hopefully more segwit2x address adoption in the face of this problem will remedy some of the congestion and people use ETH or LTC for transaction until the mempool clears.
When 300B adds to the market cap in just over a Month you know that even the slightest bad news will cause a huge drop. This correction hopefully clears out the get rich quick people and we end up with a new crew of crypto enthusiasts.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:14:13
They know that it's only a short term scaling patch but they act as if it's 'scaling solved.tm'. There isn't enough bandwith for mass adoption yet and they don't have the solution despite what they say. It's a whole lot of counterproductive noise aimed at profit for themselves. They don't give a shit about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:09:58

As far as I know It's the anonymous coin but realistically you can make a wallet with most crypto anonymously and move coins. I don't have any but I'd certainly consider it worthy of existing and think it has a place in the ecosystem simply because it's easy anonymity for new adopters. I do mean to buy some. My main concern is that monero is the pariah for banning because of the anonymous claim. I'd think it will maintain a high uptake and do well long term. But no guarantees.
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:18:18

Did he buy, sell, manufacture or import drugs? No. He was charged as if each drug sale was his. He was aware of the trade and didn't stop it. That is his crime.
Was the DEA corrupt in it's dealings, therefore casting doubt on all or any of the evidence? Yes.
This is a classic miscarriage of justice, any other case where corruption casts doubt on the evidence, leniency is shown, but not this time. A couple of years inside is plenty for starting an anonymous marketplace. Not. Life. People get less for killing people or running huge drug operations. Or both. 
This may have cast a shadow on bitcoin, but it is the actions of those in power here that have cast the shadow, not illegal trade.

True that. The trolls do play their part in promoting bitcoin too however. Any publicity helps overall, the hate train makes a lot of noise and some believe what they say. The attention although negative does bring a new audience [to bitcoin] that will either naively side with the troll or show some interest... Which is often a good thing.

I used to build online stores with zen cart
 The absolute biggest pain was hooking Visa and Mastercard up through payment gateways. It was expensive and you had to jump through hoops with banks. They all had different methods so I wasted a lot of time on it. Having a Monthly fee really hurt smaller players. Paypal did all kinds of dubious stuff and charged a fortune per transaction although easy to set up.
I always said that when someone comes up with digital cash, they would rule the world. 
So when an open source global peer to peer version arrived in the form of bitcoin I jumped onboard in terms of interest (saw it on reddit). Being that no large nasty company was behind it, I was amped. It was better than I could have hoped. Brilliant solution  Unfortunately I was working in a part of the world where it was extremely hard to obtain any so I was late to the party.  
Also crossing a lot of borders and getting stung on exchange rates had me often hoping I could just use bitcoin and do away with all these different versions of money.
In some places I'd see lines at Western Union running around the block and think man, these people could really benefit. What a waste of time and money.
It just occured to me how useful bitcoin could be.

I'm happy about it. Any publicity is good. Anything that brings bitcoin to the wider public helps us gain traction in the long run. I call it the 'Miley factor'.
I'd imagine there will be a further drop in price? I might have to transfer some cash over and wait for a good buy.

This is how I understand it (I could be wrong). A bot that buys in a declining market then sells at a loss on small amounts again and again, rinse repeat across multiple exchanges. 
The market reacts and panic sells, shorting etc. The drop continues.
It would cost a huge amount of money but fractions of what Visa etc might stand to lose if bitcoin goes mainstream. 
Does this work?

I don't have enough bitcoin to ever do that but I'm honestly, seriously looking forward to widespread use. Especially for travel and internet purchases. 
On a side note: where I live I see the poorer workers lining up to use Western Union to send money home to their families. I truly hope bitcoin becomes more mainstream to save these people from getting stung comparatively large amounts just to move funds across borders. Bitcoin technology can literally improve the lives of Millions of the worlds poorer people and cut out the already filthy rich middle man.

And this illustrates another aspect of bitcoin for you. There is a strange occurrence in bitcoin, haters/paid shills/losers with nothing better to do.
I guess some people bought in expecting to get rich and lost money and are now bitter. Some are companies wanting to create bad propaganda because bitcoin threatens their archaic business model. Some are just the loonies. Some are just luddite types afraid change however positive. 
Either way, if you are smart and read up on bitcoin, you will see it's no scam, just an utterly brilliant global, borderless wealth transfer and storage system with no corrupt central governing body.

At a hearing the same month, Gleeson told prosecutors there had been “publicized criticism” of the agreement, which lets the bank and management avoid further criminal proceedings over the charges."

You put the whole path to the .exe like C:\Users\YOURPC\Desktop\qpdf-5.1.2\bin\qpdf.exe

@_date: 2017-03-27 00:06:16
At first thought, yes of course that seems right, what's $20? But you are thinking very locally to your personal situation. 
In certain countries, there are people who line up at Western Union, every Week/Month, for hours at a time to send a portion of their tiny wages home to their struggling families in other countries. $20 might not seem like a big deal to you, but in say in the Philippines or Bangladesh, that $20 is literally all the money people live off for weeks at a time. I have personally witnessed this and I have to say, if bitcoin could reach these people, it could liberate some of the most desperate and needy. The fees and time that is taken to send money really hurts these people.
There are many clustered countries where sending money over borders is difficult, dangerous, time consuming and expensive. 
But more so, sending money between people globally is difficult. I've traveled a bit and converting currencies and calculating costs is expensive, dangerous and tedious. If I need someone to send me money it's a hassle requiring third parties that gouge like crazy. We need a global digital currency and I believe bitcoin to be the answer.
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:05:42

If you look at banking, it's also very, very complex. But we don't dig into the complexities of international banking. We just see the surface layer. Thankfully bitcoin is all there, on display to dig into as far as you are willing to take it.
The front end use of bitcoin is actually quite simple. Addresses, QR's scanning and location independence is quite neat, no need to fill out forms and present ID. No need to line up in a branch and hope you have the right documents. Anyone I have introduced bitcoin to has been surprised how simple it is to use. A smart phone, overcoming the initial skepticism and an open mind is all that is needed. 
The fact the mpesa can go so huge among some very poor people proves it's all in the application.

That's true.
But if [mpesa]( can succeed so can bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:35:42
That's not true.
Currently For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 31,640 satoshis (30c). That's 0 -25 minutes at the top of the graph so 25c still very much stands. Again, I'm being generous for the sake of a fair conversation. [Source](
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:25:12
I like this quote, this is mine now
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:30:18
Your figures are exaggerated, the common fee is [25c]( or lower with BTC. The $1-2 is in terms of larger amounts of money. BTC is not complex with third party apps and with mass adoption you won't need to convert to any currency and the price with stabilize. A BTC system similar to [mpesa]( will work well for these people. The $4.75 is a lot of money for them.
Banks and corps have been stiffing us on fees and conversion for too long. You're thinking in terms of the status quo.

My guess is that we have seen the bottom already. My feeling is that the downward pressure (bear run) is over. 
After a 'crash' there is a settling of the market normally for a while before the next big bull run. I think we're seeing that settle pan out. 
People are really tentative though, there's still a lot of bag holders above 10k I'd imagine. As some get their money back momentum will be slowed. It's been a tough time for them. Hence bad news causing dumps still. 
Take my advice with a grain of salt. But I'm interested in crypto again.

The thing is, when there is a crash/dip/correction you won't want to buy. 
Anyone who bought in the past at any time is way in front.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:06:50
Well so far, any time in the past has always been a good time to buy. Even if you bought at a peak and then a crash happened, so long as you didn't panic and hodl'd you were 100% sweet. 
But if by rediculous chance you bought then some disaster happened and the price went to $1 how would you feel? Keep that in mind and only invest what you can stomach losing. Don't take crazy risks.
However, I say buy some and keep a little change in case a dip happens.
Usually when there is a vertical price climb, it's met with a correction but there are no rules in crypto land so who could say? 
I think we are still in the very early stages of crypto. It's the wild West. Crazy things happen all the time. Be prepared for a roller coaster.

We had a similar run a few years ago where it bled out to $300 and it felt like the end. I spent a Bitcoin on games then it ran to nearly 20k. It's Doom and gloom rn but it can turn around.

If only the bcash supporters didn't spam the network causing fees to blow out, we would be in much better shape. Despite fees being so cheap now, they damaged Bitcoin and all crypto progress. When retailers were forced to drop btc payments it became hard to justify it as a currency. I still think Bitcoin or at least blockchain is the future but it will take time for retailers to see it as a viable payment method after being burnt.

It depends. It was only ever a few cents last year. These days I check with 
"Which fee should I use?
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 300 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 67,800 satoshis."
So currently it's ~$3 which is a bit high indeed but hopefully the fees will return to reasonable amounts soon.

The thing that people neglect to mention lately is that bitcoin is the invention. Not just a market leader but the innovation that sparked all of this. Every coin is a derivative of bitcoin. 
Tradionally you'd have patent rights over all crypto if your name was attatched. Because it's open source and anonymous it can be replicated without copyright infringement. But respect to the innovation is required.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be divided into '20 different coins' it's a single additional payment layer. I'm not going to explain it, maybe you can do some of this 'research' you speak of. 
My 'research' was dealing with Western Union and it's all I need to know...
You do have to queue if you want your money on the same day from these "services" you list. They all require validation so welcome to waiting days at a minimum for them to do that. You scan and email your ID, address and bank info (no more than three Months old) and wait a few days for them to process it, really superior!! In my case, they insisted I had a verified address so I had to get a signed statement from my bank. Fun! I got to queue three times! In before 'oh it's all automatic and instant' yeah no. Not when you live outside of the UK or USA. And I'm sure I can trust them with that info right? Slow clap. Yep.
Keep trying to defend your over priced, meddlesome, slow, antiquated employer.
In the mean time I'd suggest buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:22:33
The difference is that to use these services you still have to sign up, or wait in line and wait for a day for money to clear. I had to do it recently and it sucked. Also costing a lot more coupled with a shitty exchange rate. They are a relative hassle. They are like a fax machine vs email.
The current volume isn't there in terms of transactions per second for bitcoin right now but we are seeing layers added (alts, lightning, off chain transactions) that will match Visa and Mastercard in terms of speed and security and a much lower cost. So what then?

@_date: 2015-02-20 19:06:40
Good on you.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:31:05
Wait. I thought this was the trollbox?

Quick dip right now!! BUY BUY BUY *sirens...

Good on you man.

If everyone could make just one bitcoin payment online. It would take off in a bit way.

I think we gave been in the fight you stage for several years. The banks and remittance industries among others have been trying to undermine crypto in any way possible.

Just a blip with loads of sells pegged at 9k. Then a little panic sell. Buy. Buy invest buy

Not if he/she is dead. But as a post above says, he/she could easily prove they are Satoshi by accessing the first addresses and sending a transaction from one.  They could sign it 'Craig Wright is Satoshi' 5 minute job, pretty simple right. Right.
I hear Wright claims to have forgotten the passwords and no longer has access to the private keys despite claiming the addresses are his. How convenient. 
Are you telling me someone as brilliant as Satoshi would do this? I don't think so.
Craig Wright was involved early on and perhaps he knows the real identity. Lets assume the real Satoshi is dead and Craig knows this. He then feels empowered to attempt to assume the identity. 
My feeling is Craig is a scamming narcissistic con man.  But my only information if from the web so the truth is probably even more bizzare.
@_date: 2019-05-22 03:35:19
He might as well just declare copyright by announcing it in a cafe. Doesn't prove shit.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:20:14
Same. Dropped a whole bitcoin over a few months. No regrets, we need to use Bitcoin for it to be successful.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:17:04
They need to put the actual bitcoin price on the payment rather than need to convert it on the spot. Great progress though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:21:06
mBTC +1 from me

Banks suck. They are still a necessary evil but I hope that changes with crypto. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:27:55
I'm boring everyone I come into contact with... I can't help it. BITCOIN! TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:10:32
Oh I see. Probably a scammer trying to hush the forum.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:45:46
Can's see a point to use bitcoin? Fees and bullshit bank charges. They always take a cut, you pay more and the retailer gets less. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:38:50
I have given .01 to two friends so far. Feels good to spread the love.

I took an instant dislike to litecoin. It has imitation written all over it. Was considering a small investment but... Nah
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:14:05
I'm holding, even if it goes to $5. But my room mate sold at $800 and now he's all smug, it's infuriating... So yeah, do it... Please.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:53:38
The value is in the ability to transfer funds without borders or discrimination. If you travel a lot, the value becomes more obvious. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:29:13
This is awesome. Made me fist pump.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:25:17
Yes! Actually, I want to buy. I missed the last drop.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:52:00
This is great news but beware the vertical climb. Buying like this can lead to panic selling
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:52:35
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:09:41
They are aware of almost everything... Right?

OP is my room mate, I can validate his authenticity. nobodybelievesyou is on a misguided faggot hunt.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:06:52
True that. Perhaps a live update linked to the exchange then.

THE END IS NIGH! Shouldn't you be on a corner somewhere waving a cardboard sign?
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:19:43
I like 'bit'. If you have a bitcoin, it is one thousand bits. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:34:38
Imagine all the games, inventions and gadgets that will come out of all the boom. awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:45:22
It's definitely a high right now, buying at a high can give you buyers remorse, how ever brief. I'd suggest holding until 1k or so and see if it takes a hit. It might keep steaming but I feel there is a logical ceiling at that point. I want to buy a little more and that is my plan.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:23:19
I hope it's bitcoin millionaires, finally cashing out. Living the good life. Retiring from the butthole job. I wish you good folk all the best.

Screw all of the copy cat ripoff imitations. Satoshis or nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:07:18
I can't see it dropping too far without people buying in. Hopefully.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:54:51
Agreed. In the case of joining to promote the acceptance of bitcoin, I for one, will make an exception.

Satoshi Nakamoto is a collaboration of people. So nobody will own up to 'being' him. No single person can take credit for the name.
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:42:03
You can screenshot ID rather than print and scan. It will save you a lot of effort.

FATCA? Really? FATCAT More like it.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:43:45
You can't just create an account and buy bitcoin online with a credit card. You have to get verified and wait days. I'm not sure why but that would help people get onboard. I can go online right now and spend thousands of dollars on whatever I want... But not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:04:24
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:42:12
It's currently very hard for young people to spend money online. They are very comfortable with the technology and have a deeper connection with interacting online. They have less issue understanding online anonymity and security. This is the generation that will embrace bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:35:32
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:41:15
I struggle with no being able to buy bitcoins, instantly, with my credit card at the current market rate. I would have bought far below the current value if it was actually easy. It's not going to stop me though.
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:05:27

Stability is fine and all but the roller coaster is better.
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:25:58
It seems that a lot of the hacks are not just storage sites but retailers so people are getting caught out by thieves during buying and selling. Security is the major concern for most bitcoin users and anonymity is the major issue for governments. Surely that is a flaw? I'm not sure of the best validation system but perhaps something linked to mining. Perhaps a business could be created that verifies wallet accounts for a price? Maybe a limit on unverified accounts? Sorry if this is naive but I need to get it clear in my mind to help explain it to new bitcoiners.
  Edit\\ sowbug explained it perfectly
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:27:23
I was a little hastily anti altcoins. I really despise imitation but after getting to know a little more, I have switched my feelings and bought a few.   
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:30:11
Thanks for the warning. I hope they catch those scumbags and lock them up. Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:47:43
Yes. You are a genius sir.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:45:51
Yeah. If paypal wasn't such a terrible service, we might no be so keen to get onboard the bitcoin train. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:08:24
You must be fairly well of financially and not really needing cash. Most people would be thinking taking a small profit now would be wise.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:34:11
I think the opposite will actually happen. If I spent $500 on a bitcoin and then can buy something worth $1500 I will do it with glee. As people make money on the coins and cashing out becomes a tax issue, then spending the coins will be the best option. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:54:23
Wow, that's a wonderful explanation. I really appreciate it. I had not considered that adding an identity to a wallet could be easy to fake anyway and giving me the real world examples makes perfect sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:26:05
Absolutely I really can't stay inte

I imagine there will be a big US sell coming up to Christmas to pay for all of those presents also.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:13:39
It's become the second most popular by being the closest clone. It's not angst dictating the negativity towards litecoin, it's honour and respect. True innovation should be rewarded and imitators should be shunned. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:12:37
Flattened since
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:41:16
This kind of anti-publicity is actually great for bitcoin. Negative publicity helps fuel interest. He is, in a sense sabotaging his own interests.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:27:16
Great to see more online retailers opening up. Onward and upward. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:59:55

*  Give young people the power to pay online.
* Open up travel ease with a unified currency.

Could be. Either way, you can't say. So it's a fun gamble.
