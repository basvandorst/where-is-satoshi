I'm actually really enjoying his hype right now because the whole Bitfinex thing is depressing.

I think you missed it. It went down to like 480 at one point.

This is a nice comment. I like it. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:23:24
Yeah in this video they are talking like it's just a matter of time until a bitcoin ETF gets approved.

One day it'll be easier to make a database of non bitcoin users ;)
@_date: 2016-04-25 07:16:14
I enjoyed reading your post. I also think that Bitcoin should be treated as currency rather than property. The hassle of calculating capital gains is pretty much the only thing that's keeping me from spending Bitcoin at the moment. 
I have a few questions:
1. If the tax ruling changes to treat Bitcoin as currency, would there be no taxes if it is used to directly purchase goods, even if the price of Bitcoin has gone up significantly from the time you acquired it?
2. How likely do you think it is that the tax ruling will be changed? 
3. Anything Bitcoiners can do to support such a change? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 03:12:17

Thank you! So this wouldn't be very useful for Bitcoin fans, but it's nice for people who only want to trade it?

Your style of writing gives me headaches.

It was already big news a few days ago. Still bullish nonetheless.
@_date: 2016-04-29 06:58:40
You just helped me figure out what my issue with Coinbase was. I didn't like that all of a sudden I couldn't buy anymore bitcoin without providing more identification. I don't have a problem with providing identification, I just didn't appreciate their lack of warning. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 07:09:01
Well to be fair, only a little while ago everything on that sub was Blockstream Core this and that and how it's a conspiracy to destroy Bitcoin. I do agree that discussions are a little more neutral there now. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 07:30:25
Thank you for your contribution!

@_date: 2016-04-11 02:40:28
What if they know the difference and it was simply a typo?
@_date: 2016-04-02 17:12:05
Would that count as a donation or payment? Would capital gains tax apply to these micropayments?
@_date: 2016-04-23 06:09:36
I never really understood the business model of changetip. I'm not surprised by this.

It's good to have a estimated release date. Something to look forward to.

Can someone ELI5 what an ETF is?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:45:46
I'm confident they will start rolling out once core 0.16 comes out. Plus, you can still send to exchanges that don't have segwit implemented. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:26:53

@_date: 2016-04-07 06:32:36
I think speculation is valuable for Bitcoin, especially right now when we don't have a massive network of users. Speculation will bring in new people who are curious of Bitcoin's potential. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:45:52
I have no strong feelings, one way or the other.

This is unrelated, but how is Project Fi?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:21:52
That was my original plan, but since fees haven't been this cheap in a while, I decided to migrate. It kind of feels good knowing all my future transactions will be segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:40:12
This is gentlemen 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:10:14
Try transferring $400mil
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:24:17
If people are migrating from legacy to segwit addresses, those transactions wouldn't be segwit transactions. So if anything, segwit usage should be increasing *after* people have migrated. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:45:53
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:16:49
I'll believe it when I see it
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:23:40
Much needed shit post of the day!
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:04:43


It doesn't work like that. You have to move to a segwit address before you can take advantage of segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 01:52:59
Don't worry, we'll have another November!
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:38:01
Segwit -&gt; segwit and segwit -&gt; legacy are both segwit transactions. As far as why the usage is up, it's really hard to say. You could be right. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:09:49
That was Bic Camera. This is Yamada Denki.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:06:40
It's a new type of transaction format that uses block space more efficiently
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:35:28
Do they still require Bitcoin payment protocol wallets?
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:57:23
Except OP said 


@_date: 2018-01-05 16:13:45
Then why allow bitcoin visa cards in the first place? My guess is that there was some change in regulations.

We're so lucky we get to re-live these moments!
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:16:23
From this thread: 
"Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 
A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 
A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.
A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address."
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:24:49

That's basically what I do now, press play and listen while doing something else. It's not a major inconvenience so I'm just being spoiled asking you for this. With that being said, it would be really smooth to have your show on my podcast app so it'll download automatically and I can listen to it whenever. Also, I just found your SoundCloud channel. Have you stopped posting there? That would be my second choice after podcasts. Anyway, thanks for reading and I love your shows! You rock!

What would happen if everyone predicted this?
@_date: 2015-12-13 15:24:16
I'd say it's partially priced in. People that have been here for a while definitely keep this in mind while buying, but people that will newly get into Bitcoin can't possibly know about the halving.
@_date: 2015-12-04 15:48:01

I think we can all agree that discussion of segwit is relevant to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-02-05 21:00:51
I think he/she is just trying to share segwit info with the BU guys so some of them might see merit in it. Linking to a core site will immediately make the BU guys shut their ears.   
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:25:00
Every time someone asks for a technical criticism of segwit, all I hear is how this sub is censored. Makes me think there really isn't an argument.

They were just talking about this on a major news podcast in Japan. One of them was saying that Mt. Gox was a problem with the exchange, and not with Bitcoin itself. He said something like "if a huge amount of Japanese yen were stolen from a safe, you wouldn't say that the yen was the problem, right?" I was impressed. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:46:02

It's serious business now!
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:45:45
Exactly my point. If Coinbase didn't make an announcement, how would customers know what stance the company is taking? If the customers don't like XT, at least they are informed enough to take their business elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:26:55
I want them to leave so we can get segwit activated. The impact on price that they have by leaving is far less than the potential impact of a contentious hard fork.

The BU side must be hella weak because it started from conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:51:28
My opinion is that we should keep the block size as small as possible, but at the same time I am open to a block size increase like the old classic way. No way am I supporting this emergent consensus idea without it being thoroughly tested first.

Wow that's a scary thought. If most of the nodes were BU today, it would've been a disaster for Bitcoin.

When rbtc started shitting on Andreas Antonopolous, I knew they had gone to the dark side. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:07:24
I've been saying this all along, but BU proponents have told me that it is in the best interest of miners to raise the block size limit to allow more transactions and collect more fees that way. Any thoughts on this? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:29:50

I'd like to see ATH prices in 2016, even if only for a moment. Then at least the critics can't say bitcoin peaked in 2013 anymore.

Spend and replenish with the fiat you would have used to purchase the item. This way you support merchants that accept bitcoin and you don't decrease your holding.

I'm so glad I didn't give up :')

@_date: 2017-01-21 02:41:29
That's the biggest concern I have with BU. Do they have the dev skills to update, maintain and innovate Bitcoin in the future?
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:21:28
This is the only logical answer  
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:26:56
We're gonna jump by $1000 each month? $12,000 by end of 2017 confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:52:49
I would give segwit a month or so to allow fees to go down a little 
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:28:12
And I suppose the other sub is much better? Lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:35:31

I'm pretty sure litecoin would be better suited to take over btc if anything. Definitely not bch.

I heard trezor is enabling segwit transactions today. Not an exchange, but I feel like that would be a big one!
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:36:47
Who's opinion on segwit should we listen to then? Is there anyone with the technical capabilities and no bias?

@_date: 2017-01-15 20:25:50
So is Bitcoin mainstream now? :)
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:47:45
I don't think there's anything that could be said to change the minds of people in at this point. They seem to religiously believe core developers are evil and raising the block size limit is the only way to scale Bitcoin. I guess we'll just have to wait and see how much support segwit actually gets. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:38:48

@_date: 2016-11-24 04:27:32

Brb gonna freeze my body, wake me up when 1 Bitcoin is enough. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 04:52:42
In other words, there is more support for segwit after just one day
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:31:23
Maybe something like "bitcoin hodl origin"?
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:46:22
Oh yeah? is comedy Bitcoin!

@_date: 2016-11-02 17:46:54

@_date: 2016-12-09 05:47:50
It only has little support because of Blockstream core propaganda!! /s
@_date: 2016-12-13 05:25:13

@_date: 2016-11-19 22:53:49

@_date: 2016-11-26 20:41:07
I agree. The biggest difference between Core and BU in my opinion is the developers behind each project.

Raising the blocksize is a half assed short term solution to scalability. Too bad people are falling for it though.

I can see them changing the argument to something stupid like "oh it was never really about whether segwit is good or bad. It's about getting back control over development from the core guys"

1. I just heard about BitQuick yesterday here on reddit when someone recommended you guys for buying Bitcoins quickly.
2. You can use a cash deposit to buy Bitcoins and it's quick!
3. Not really a dislike, but I'm not entirely sure how to do the cash deposit.

And he also uses the Bitcoin symbol whenever he talks about money in his videos! Subtle, but still cool.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:04:37
It matters to us because they are still going to use the Bitcoin name. For example, if they fork off and there is a vulnerability in their code (like with BU), there will be headlines saying "vulnerability found in Bitcoin Cash" and it will scare new people away from the actual Bitcoin. If they want to fork off, I want them to use a completely different name.
