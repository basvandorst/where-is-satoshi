BitcoinTalk: 
Just received my order of Bitbills Bankcards today!
These are just as advertised: cheap(ish) aluminum cards, engraved with the public and private keys. Two cards come in a set: a 'payee card,' which includes the public key only, both in human-readable Base 58 and QR code formats; and a 'bank card,' which includes the private key in QR, as well as the public and private keys in human-readable Base 58 format.
The cards are somewhat fragile, easily bent and scratchable. Some slight scratches exist on the cards from shipping, but I am satisfied with them overall.
As for suggestions of improvement, I wouldn't mind seeing these in some stronger metals, perhaps dyed stainless steel or actual brass (not just brass colored). Also, having the human-readable keys in HEX, in addition to the Base 58, would be nice.
Thanks bitbills, for raising the bar again.
Long live Bitcoin!

The oldest and most time-tested method for long-term reliable "digital" data storage is punched paper tape.  Punched tape has been used for well over 70 years, and is still in use, to this day, in many manufacturing environments.
Punched paper tape was widely used years ago to store text documents, and mechanical teletype machines were deployed for copying tapes and printing them out to paper.
See 
Unlike magnetic tape, punched paper tape is not harmed by strong magnetic fields or radiation.  Modern punch tape is made of a tear-proof paperlike film, and could easily survive in a safe or on a bookshelf for hundreds of years.
In addition to having unusually high longevity, the encoding protocol for punched tape has been standardized for decades.  Punched tapes from the 1940s are still readable on modern equipment, and, modern tapes punched today can still be printed and copied with antique teletypes.
Semi-modern digital reader/writer units can be easily connected to modern computers, and, because of the tape's simple binary encoding scheme, it is fairly easy for any moderately competent electronics major to build a reader from commonly-available parts.
Modern Unit: 
Basic Unit: 
Home Made: 
If you are looking for truly hardcopy backups of your wallet, I'd say convert it to ASCII and punch it to tape.  As with the posts above, we're talking about long-term emergency-use backups.
TL;DR -  Backup your wallet to old-school punched tape.

The service is intended primarily for the US market, but it is known to work in some Canadian border states.  We do not guarantee coverage outside of the United States, but we have heard reports of scattered service in various places.
No international voice is provided, but unlimited international SMS to many countries is.  We plan to provide a full list on the site soon.
Yes, we have discussed this in detail with our SIM vendor and attorney, and the United States currently has no requirement to register telephones, nor keep detailed sales records.  (For tax purposes, we must keep a list of sales, including prices, but not the contact information for buyers.  This is the same as you buying a can of Pepsi at the local gas station: they keep a record of the sale and sale price, but that's it.)

Tower bi- and triangulation have existed since the very beginning of cellular telephony, and is more sophisticated than ever.  Most GSM towers now require a sane-looking GPS fix before allowing a call to progress.
Use of directional antennas and GPS-spoofing devices work around some of these restrictions, but their use is often detected, flagging the call for extra scrutiny.  This can backfire so strongly that it is generally avoided by the pros.
A BurnerPhone.us kit will only protect you so far.  Some common tips include never bringing your phone to your place of work or residence, and not calling numbers that can be associated with you.
In a perfect scenario, multiple Burner Phones are purchased, activated in random location(s), and only ever used to communicate with each other.  This prevents traffic-analysis and other common spycraft techniques.

In addition to the massive amount of research (selecting a phone model, bulk purchasing, comparing SIM offerings, asking the hard questions), we do a few uncommon things like pre-charge the batteries and include a cheat-sheet of security best-practices.

You could use a BurnerPhone.us SIM card in any unlocked GSM phone, but this prevents true anonymity, as the phone's serial number (IMEI) can be used to easily determine other SIMs previously used, which makes tracing the origin of the phone much easier.
BurnerPhone.us only sells complete kits (hardware and service) as a means to enforce this additional security layer.

What makes it expensive is getting a brand-new phone each month, which is a requirement for security.  Still a good deal in my opinion, considering what a contract phone costs.
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:51:42
The real claim to make is that we never record SIM assignments to begin with, ever.
When you order a BurnerPhone.us kit, we pick up our "bag 'o SIM cards," fish one out, and load it into the phone.  We never even look at the SIM number, much less write it down.
Even if shipping information is somehow obtained, it does not show where any particular SIM card went to, making the information much less useful.
We do indeed destroy shipping details, which is kind of dangerous for us as it puts us at risk for credit card fraud.  But this is a risk we must take to provide the service to the customer.
Bitcoin orders, of course, are immune from this problem, and we will be pushing Bitcoin has hard as we can on BurnerPhone.us.

The choice of naming was to capture keyword traffic from the popular Google search.  Keyword research was conducted, and it was determined that "Burner Phone" is the most popular search for people seeking the product we offer.  Burner Phones have many legal uses, and the term is so common that it would be foolish to not take advantage of the notoriety.  Instead of working hard to create a brand-name, we are simply usurping a common phrase that describes our product.
We are riding off of the T-Mobile nationwide GSM network.
We plan to stay in business by selling 2 or more burner phones per day.  This is our minimum goal, which would make the venture worth continuing.  The business itself is perfectly legal, as the US does not (yet) require cellular phones to be registered, and anonymous purchases are still very legal.
We have no way to prove we are not keeping records, unfortunately.
If the Government ever subpoenas information, we will gladly provide what we have, which will be only a list of items sold, dates and sale prices, without any information identifying buyers.  Tax laws force us to keep records of sales, but do not require us to keep records of buyers.
Finally, if we ever receive some super-secret order forcing us to collect and share data (PRISM style), we will simply close the business and refuse further orders.  This venture is not designed to make us all rich, as the markup on this product is very thin.  We are not afraid to walk away if the integrity of our product's anonymity is ever threatened.

The phone's serial number (IMEI) is the primary way to track calls made by a cellular phone, independent of telephone number.  Changing out a SIM card is only half of the battle.
Anyone who has access to CDR (call detail records), could easily correlate IMEI numbers to determine every SIM card ever used on a given phone.
This makes it necessary to replace both the phone and SIM card, at the same time.  This is the only way to completely separate the identities, and even this is not foolproof.
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:44:44
Red Phone and Silent Circle claim this functionality, but by merely running software on standard smartphones, you run the risk of having your phone infected with spy software, invisibly defeating the crypto.
Spy types can (and will) obtain physical access to your phone (for only a few seconds) to install software to overcome any of this software-based security.  See  for an example of this technology.
By using dedicated hardware, that you replace on demand, it makes it much harder to tamper with.  Even if an adversary does manage to tamper with the phone, you will soon discard it and use a new one.
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:15:42
We currently ride off of the T-Mobile Nationwide GSM Network, and expect to continue this relationship.
Concerning voice recording, this cannot be avoided on the PSTN.  Evidences are plentiful that all calls in the United States are recorded and stored by the NSA for use in National Security investigations.
It is highly unlikely, however, that anything a normal person does will ever reach a level requiring the NSA to open their archive of recorded call audio.
Buying a phone with cash is not as secure as expected.  Several cases exist in which people, after buying a prepaid phone with cash, were tracked down by video recordings or eyewitness reports.

Its a BLU Tank T190i, but we don't generally sell the phone by itself.
You are free to do with the phone as you please, but for maximum security you should stop using it once the SIM expires.

SMS messages are already fairly obsolete, with many people using smartphone technologies like WhatsApp, Hangouts, or even AIM.
What makes SMS unique is the ubiquity.  Nearly every mobile worldwide has the ability, which makes it desirable for general use.
I am a fan of BitMessage, but believe the protocol needs a lot of work before it is ready for general use.  Unlike Bitcoin, Bitmessage was released to the public before many of the bugs were worked out of it.
In the future, I expect the whole PSTN to be replaced with a Bitmessage-style communication infrastructure, where you place and receive calls on Bitcoin-style keypairs.
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:31:08
Yes, it is possible with illegal hardware to arbitrarily change the IMEI of a GSM phone, and such phones exist on the black market.
Because of the illegal nature of such devices, they are hard to come by, and not sold commercially.
Even if I had access to such hardware, it would be illegal to sell openly, and would be restricted to places like the Silk Road.
For BurnerPhone.us, a legitimate business, we are going to sell FCC approved devices only.

Technology such as this is prohibitively expensive for everyone except the very top-level government agencies.
To compare samples of millions (or billions) of recorded calls, and then parse through the detected hits, attempting to find the phone number used by a known actor, is reserved for the very highest of national security matters.
It is exceedingly unlikely that anyone reading this will ever be involved in something requiring this level of investigation.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that the resources required to perform this search, namely the call recordings themselves, exist outside of a very very small handful of databases.

Prepaid phones sold in retail outlets are typically subsidized, and sold for near or less than costs, with the understanding that the sales of service make up the difference.  This is often called the "Razor and Blades" marketing method.  
See 
BurnerPhone.us sells both the hardware and service at (slightly) under retail, and throws in free shipping for good measure.  I assure you that our markup is very reasonable.
The current SIM vendor rides primarily on T-Mobile, with other GSM carriers as fallbacks, and we expect to continue this relationship indefinitely.

Many carriers choose to collect this data, but are not required.
In 2010, two senators made some noise about this, and tried to pass a law about it.  See 
As of yet, it is still legal to sell such phones anonymously.  Most prepaid carriers choose to make a token effort to collect information, to "cover their asses" in case their product is ever abused.  These token efforts are really lame, and typically require customer information to be self-reported with no verification.
Burner Phone chooses to not keep records of customer information.
