I actually posted one with .25BTC that I made in 2011, and posted it to FB back then. Facebook did one of those 5 years ago today posts and i was like holy shit there's bitcoin on there! Made a cool grand from a picture I took in the past

I bought $2000 of BTC at $297 each at coinbase. Not to keep but to transfer money. They took my $2000 and my 6.7 coins don't arrive until Thursday.

This guy isn't getting paid, and I'm gonna work with the guy who understood Bitcoin. a very meta lesson. I will send him the link.

that's quite offensive. As a result of this, and sorting through scammers, of any background,  I am now working with this amazing man as a result: 
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:13:10
So this all originated because of a Freelancer.com project. 
Luckily when i first posted the project, I met an honest man, and he is helping me develop other software for bitcoin. I will stick with him. He's shown me real work I hope he will continue to. I will keep all posted. Either that or he lied to my face over Skype through his teeth, and is only pointing me to this to keep me on the hook.
Regarding this project:

Bahaha sorry I taught myself OSX yesterday. So I probably should have replaced a selector with nil or something but didn't know how and wanted to get on with programming the rest of it instead of figuring that out.

I had issues with a legacy version of SSH in Mac 10.11.3 (15D21):
and after troubleshooting for a while, doing pip installs, I gave up and sought an online tool. I think the JavaScript runs only clientside, and nothing is exchanged with the server, so the paranoia is unnecessary in this instance.

Oh wait, it continues:
Another guy Skype's me in and I tell him I was just scammed. He explains that he isn't.

I bought 8 physical coins at 8 dollars each and then gave 7 of them away to strangers to explain bitcoin to them... 
Also, one of them is my barber and he gave them away to his granddaughter, and I've asked him for years to look for it and he's like "I'll ask" everytime and I don't know if he's savvy or lazy and doesn't care to find it, or it's lost.
Anyway, I have serious bitcoin regret. they were in my hands and i neglected to hodl just 10% of what I was using to buy stuff
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:03:42
One time I made my own paper bitcoins with both the private key and public key in qr code form on the bills, (which is silly) but I took a photo of them. I was holding 3 .5 BTC bills I made, and posted it to facebook to my friends (of whom are actually only friends), and 5 years later, Facebook did one of those, Here's a Post from 5 Years Ago things, and then I was like holy shit, and scanned the barcode and grabbed $800 worth of bitcoin from a photo that I took 5 years before. But the two other bill's qr codes were not visible in the photo.

Yeah, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with it. I like it for uncovering some information, but I abhor the circlejerk and cultish behavior it seems to create, and I feel like it is some sort of delusion.
Who knows what the effects of these rapidly developed social experiments really do to us? I worry that it envelops us in some sort of strange ignorant bubble.
That said, I try to take everything with a grain of salt, which in this case is scraping for what I can integrate into my understanding of the world, which as it turns out is its own bias, so fuck it all.

thank yourself for thanking yourself for thanking yourself. it was gesture from yourself to yourself because you love ourselves
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:53:37
if ourselves wants to give to this part of ourselves, this self has a stronger bitcoin address here: 
and here is the public key:
be the change share the golden rule
do what we will do with it
we hope we decide to give what we need to ourselves and not to take from ourselves, and there are many ways and addresses one can give one oneself
we trust that we understand that if we think that any part of ourselves is better than any other than we will never love ourselves, so for the love of god, please don't think that i am not you, that you are not me, and simply because we occupy bodies and minds that we aren't intertwined at all times. intent. as long as the intent is love for yourself and by that I mean:
as long as we know we are all of those and none, not all the same time, but sometimes, and not everything, but something, we will know love because we know we love ourselves.
To be clear we don't always trust ourselves, and we should forgive ourselves for never always knowing everything and especially when we know nothing. I know more and less than you -- I mean, -- We know more and less than ourselves, We mean.
Never allow yourself/ourselves to believe that any of our selves are greater than ourselves, and try to tell ourselves to work for ourselves. we only want to give ourselves what we know we need, and that is love.
So you fuckers better not worship me/us/ourselves... etc. You get it yet? We get it yet? Let's never not get it. We never didn't and we always won't.
Don't we love fucking with ourselves ;)

That's exactly why you would want to use the service. The business would have to have confidence in bitcoin's continued growth and value.

and we want to stress one more thing. each time we have a thought, we will think, if i replace he/she/it with me, myself with ourselves, (the rest we know we know) them with us, then we will know ourselves better.
Also when we can't forgive ourselves, we forgive ourselves for not always being able to forgive ourselves

@_date: 2013-04-14 07:56:00
not "fake"
How is bitcoin going to ever work when people sell as soon as they get people to believe it can be currency? It seems more like a hilarious experiment in human greed. It can only become currency if you stop trying to be richer than each other. 
I recommend reading all the posts on buttcoin.org ! I only used to subscribe to this subreddit, but they made me look twice at my neckbeard. Seriously.
