Your taxes are going to be a nightmare. You are supposed to report every trade regardless if you "cashed out". You are "supposed" to pay taxes each quarter so that you don't end up with a penalty when you file. Yeah the us tax system is ridiculous...

Not sure. Q4 was due yesterday, I just checked. Normally you would want to print it off here:  . The one called payment voucher 4 and then give a rough estimate of what the taxes you owe will be with a check.
If I were you I would still mail the Q4 even if it is late and then file my federal taxes a little afterwards. I am just a guy doing my own taxes tho so you are probably better off seeking an accountants advice.

I am usually pretty critical of bitcoin when it comes to scaling but this is very good to see! Hopefully more segwit adoption drives the fees even lower.

Today is the last day to file for Q4. Better do that shit fast and rush to the post office. Hope you arent on the east coast.
edit: You might have till tomorrow. I would do these asap.

Your family should not be involved in your finances regardless of what you are spending it on. It's rich seeing people hand out financial advice as they max out their credit cards to pay for garbage, pay the minimum, buy brand new cars on loan that lose their value the second they leave the lot, and fill there house with useless overpriced shit made from china. At least people investing in crypto are spending money on something that could change their life for the better or at least teach them valuable lessons about saving and investing instead of wasting it on junk.

Does the stabilizer on top work well? I have only ever done it on the bottom but sometimes my design gets all fucked up. Wonder if that would help.

Except for well you know there massive profit margins which did not exist in the dotcom bubble...
Not twitter and snap obviously but Amazon Google and Facebook are killing it.
