Please don’t tell me that Bitcoin is easy to interact....
Start on buying ( open a account with kyc on a exchange) , save some 21 random keys on a peace of paper, send btc is another pain in the ass, u need to copy a big string of random letters and numbers or use a QR code.... c’mon that’s not for your grandma or your mother... thats not for the average guy

That’s more likely

The decentralization is good, but on the actual state, nobody ( i mean non tech person) will use it.
I’m afraid that the ordinary people will use FBcoin instead
