As long as all newcomers understand the mentality of [HODL]( we're all good

These are the 'noobies' that will become entreprenours and help educate people around them to draw in the bigger masses to this.
Give them some better encouragement than calling them 'noobies', please.
We're all in this together, against the banks. Don't forget that

Listen to Trace Mayer about this. He has some very good points. I really recommend listening to whole this interview
 
At least I know what I'm gonna do. HODL on for dear life

Milton Friedman didn't really agree with that inflation is a good thing, but still we do it for "some reason"
 about 8-9 minutes in they talk about inflation. Great discussion and I think everyone should watch part 1 and 2 of this.

By traditional currency I think they mean minted by a cental bank.
Since commodity, asset or currency don't fit why don't we just see it as the new class it is? People should be able to differ between 'traditional' currencies and crypto anyway, don't make it confusing to explain to your kids who's gonna use it for a way longer time than any of us are.

Today  seems to have been updated with accurate information. 
I've been monitoring  daily and we can see that there's been less than 20k unconfirmed since 29th of january even tho blockchain.info was showing between 30-40k. 
Anyone know why it wasn't accurate?
