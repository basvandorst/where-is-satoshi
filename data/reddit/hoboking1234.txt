Relative to the status quo, Bitcoin is chaos. Chaos is a ladder. This ladder is actually a spaceship leaving the planet before the equivalent of economic nuclear disaster strikes. Yes, your loved ones may be too stupid to hop on, but don't let that distract you from thinking, as the spaceship leaves orbit and you stare back at the only place you've ever lived, that you made the right choice.  Do we know exactly where we will land? When we will land? If we can even land? No. But we know we cannot stay there.

Why can't there be a temporary (or permanent) increase in the block size limit to 1.5MB or 2MB?

Bitcoin are tulips... that can be:
* Sent across the world in minutes
* Transferred with relatively low fees
* Do not die
* Have a maximum supply
* Highly divisible
* Can be used to buy a growing number of things

Can you share what arguments counter the KYC/AML concerns associated with Lightning Networks? Are these valid concerns?

Depends on what you mean by survive. It's price would be very subjective then and probably too volatile to be a 'commodity'.

If you have free electricity, yes it may be 'worthwhile' in modest amounts. Otherwise as others have said, the BTC mining ship has sailed for CPUs/GPUs.

We are in a USD bubble! It's obvious by how many "economists" (who don't have any intrinsic value in our new peer to peer digital currency world) have jobs. Economist mania.

You can try but the laws of linguistics will reign supreme. The fact that 'crypto' is being accepted as a general term for cryptocurrency is a sign of the advancement of cryptocurrency. Why can't 'cryptocurrency' dwarf 'cryptography' in the public sphere, vernacular? Doesn't "money" dwarf "cryptography" today in relative importance?

Sounds like a problem with your bank and/or bank account. $50 is low.

1. Wait until Segwit is activated. Probably tomorrow or something.
2. Move all of your funds to a wallet where you can specify the network fee.
3. For bank transfers, that's tougher. Could avoid fees by doing  and buying giftcards.

Assume you pay 1% fee to purchase a BTC with USD. That fee can be counted towards your cost basis (you have $100 in BTC and paid $1 for it, your cost basis is **$101**). You send your BTC to someone, and they send it back to you. Transaction fees make your BTC now worth $99. BTC rises in value so that your $99 is now worth **$110**. You withdraw. You owe capital gains taxes on **$110 - $101** = *$9*.
The transaction fees do not really apply other than they reduce what you ultimately withdraw into USD. You may potentially owe taxes on the transactions themselves as well but that is a separate tax (not capital gains). For complicated situations where the cost basis is difficult to calculate, consult with a Bitcoin tax specialist.

Write a python script that runs everyone few minutes to check the Bitcoin price. If the price exceeds a certain threshold percentage change (3%), it will send you a text and store that value to compare against later. This way, if the price does not vary too much, you won't be bugged.

In the US, you still owe taxes (not capital gains, though) on that transaction. Something along the lines of a 'sales tax' but not sure what the name is.

"and the market for it comes from people using it to transact business" I agree this is *one* function but gold is valued above it's intrinsic value. If you take away the 'currency' portion of Bitcoin, people could still use it as a digital cold with easier exchange.

Hypothetically: Is the Fed capable of halting the inflation process/printing of money?  Is it already on the hook (to pay off past debts) to print the next $1B? Next $10B? Next $1T?

Your coins exist on blockchain A. Your coins will exist on blockchain A and blockchain A2X. No need to involve Coinbase at this point.

It is generally recommended that you have a unique address for each transaction.  With that in mind, I wouldn't say it is "dangerous" to reuse one.

Seems like Asia may be a little more bullish than we thought. It's not tumbling at least (yet).

The fees in the US should not be that high if using a bank account unless you are purchasing a small amount.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:47:27
I think the question was more related to the Asian markets (like NYSE, etc.). Once they open, one would also expect an increase in trading activity with Bitcoin (as people move funds around).

Not Coinbase's fault that you are under 16 and did not complete verification requirements for withdrawal. Their customer service is probably swamped now but may take 2-3 days.

He was clearly buying Bitcoin the whole time during that segment. That's why he was so distracted. Price kept going up.
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:16:57
Per [Coinbase's support website](


Looks like you are getting hit with the flat fee (a) as opposed to the percentage fee (b). My guess is that since you are using CAD, Coinbase has adjudicated a US$0.99 fee, converted that to CAD, and concluded with a CA$1.34 fee. Given the current exchange rate between USD and CAD (1:1.35), this seems like what is happening.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:57:28
Who knows? But maybe they ban your account and prevent you from purchasing any in the future.

Okay. I was confused because this image makes it seem like ABC only happens if SegWit fails (BIPs 91 and 148 fail).

To be clear, this is if SegWit does not activate, right?

HODLing is a brainwashing technique used to trick noobs to hold Bitcoin while the price drops. Meanwhile, the brainwashers are selling/buying more when it is appropriate.  /s

You violated their terms of service. Not much you can do but wait until support resolves the issue or try anotherethod to get Bitcoin. Good luck.
