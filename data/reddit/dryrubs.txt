Tell me how a country with a capitalist mode of production and liberal elections can be considered socialist?

Oh you’re so tough. What levels of mental masturbation will you stoop to in order to cope for the fact that you are a shill for a ruling class that gives no fucks about you? I don’t need to visit Venezuela or Cuba. I can see the negative effects of capitalism in almost every country on the planet. That’s enough for me. Also your Uruguayan, one of the most privileged groups of people in all of Latin America. Lmao telling a Dominican that I’m too privileged

The United States of America sets wages as well (it’s called a minimum wage), we set prices too for certain key industrial goods, we also seize private property via eminent domain. Are we socialist? If anything Venezuela seems like the equivalent of a European Social democratic state. Also total lack of consumer goods? Nice propaganda there buddy

I honestly have no idea how you can say this when the majority of western countries are experiencing the effects of a massive refugee crisis

This post is about people leaving Venezuela presumably due to the economic condition present in said country. If anything your original comment has less to do with the post than mine does. Also Venezuela went socialism? Not even the Venezuelan government says they’re socialist. God please educate these people

I’m not angry. Also Hayek (Road to Serfdom) and Friedman argue for neoliberal policies that have devastated Latin American countries and have brought a resurgence in left wing thought. Maybe you’ll outgrow the Atlas shrugged libertarian part of life once you stop being selfish and think about others before yourself. Also Friedman helped overthrow the democratically elected president of Chile and helped install a dictator there. You probably know this but you don’t care about freedom, you just want privilege. It’s sad you get your “basic economics” from such biased sources. Read everything you can because if that’s all you’ve read then you have a lot of catching up to do

I’m actually Dominican lol but continue being a key board warrior. And wow you spoke to people who left a country hmm I wonder what they’ll have to say about the country they left. Let’s interview Mexican refugees next and hear what they have to say about capitalist Mexico

You’re true colors show. you don’t care about human rights or human dignity. You’ll do anything to maintain your privilege. Unfortunately for you, your time has ended and now regular people will have a say in the affairs of the world around them. Also I am not speaking about the socialism of the 20th century, that experiment was tried already. I am speaking of now and how all countries deserve to have their own independence outside of what the US wants for them

Can we chill on the propaganda for a bit 
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:17:54
I too am against them. I’m also against the nationalist globalists /s

Lmao at mega corporations being socialism. If you can’t take the effects of capitalism it’s say it, but don’t try to pin it in an ideology you know nothing about 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:33:25
So you find it useful to call out an ideology that’s opposed to the current monetary financial system on a sub dedicated to moving away from that very same monetary system?
