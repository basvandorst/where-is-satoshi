I just opened a bank account with TD Bank, got the exact same question re: where my income is coming from and how many transactions I'll be making. Coinbase is complying. Plus, is it that hard to just say "normal wage work :)"? They're not going to dig into it.

Is signing up on Twitter extremely expensive and time consuming? Or are you too lazy to do it but not too lazy to make a reddit post?
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:36:31
That still stands. Did you not understand OP?
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:38:25
Nope, you are completely and entirely wrong. Bitcoin will succeed thanks to hodlers and buyers, not consumers and sellers.
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:21:14
You sound like the poorest poorfag imaginable. Someone like yourself, who lives in abject poverty, should get a job and stay away from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-14 05:18:04
Just get a credit card with cash back, more convenient and you save money to hodl coins with. Promoting the ecosystem is premature and a waste of resources.

Wut. C++ and Ada are about the same age. Ada's latest major release was 2012.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:28:30
It's part of the JavaScript culture: move fast and break things, fail fast, etc...
Basically, if a Bitcoin company wanted to be taken seriously, they would do almost everything in Ada. It's not really about the programming language, it's more about the developer culture that comes with it, see for example

How many times have you implemented multisig?
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:32:36
Ehrm, right, but you realize many banks do use Ada right? (Along with military, aerospace, etc... basically when lives are on the line)
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:55:23
They're probably faking the volume, though you'd think they could do it more subtly. Laziness I guess.

They aren't your IT staff. They are volunteer software engineers.
Let's not perpetuate a toxic culture of disrespect. With "software eating the world" society is going to have to change it's attitude about software engineers. They're the new bosses.

Why would someone take the other side of this contract without charging the miners through the nose for the risk?
There's this concept called self-insurance. That's what miners are doing and it's not necessarily the wrong approach. It makes sense for miners to go out of business when mining is uneconomical, why would they pay huge premiums to continue wasting money?

You really think Derpopoulos is going to pass up an opportunity to get some consulting fees, or even a cushy gig? He's been having a hard time finding gainful employment after he got fired from blockchain.info

I agree. Knowledgeable people, i.e. those who know nothing, thought Bitcoin was a dying experiment two weeks ago.

Which is it? Are they all equally affected, or is there one implementation that excised DNS and thus was unaffected? Do you know which implementation OP is referring to? Have you compiled and synced it? 
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:52:19
You're just repeating what you originally posted. Someone else actually answered my questions: 
Low-IQ people like yourself are really undermining Bitcoin.

Thank you, very disappointing that did not research before characterizing a comment as trolling. I look forward to trying this implementation out.

What an embarrassing waste of money, you should've hodled instead. Now you'll have to waste even more money getting it removed when you grow up.

I dunno if your reading comprehension is at fault or your communication skills. Either way, the Linux OS is vulnerable to the extent that client applications use DNS. If the only client application in use is Bitcoin, then ergo therefore...

Right, and every waiter in LA isn't "meant to be" a waiter. They still get compensated as a waiter.
Bottom line is that VCs have a mandate to invest in tech startups, not commodities. VCs want exposure to Bitcoin. There's no way to arb the two, so you end up with over-valued Bitcoin startups.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:34:22
Yup, this is a basic practice used throughout the financial system. Would've stopped this scammer cold. To blame anything "cyber" is disingenuous.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:41:27


I completely agree. The point I was making is that the problem the company had wasn't really "bitcoin cybersecurity" / securing their bitcoins, **it was their practice of not doing callbacks for large transfers**. 
Bitcoiners tend to *completely* overthink all of the multisig/cold storage/pgp/etc crypto stuff and *completely* neglect the common sense, widely used practices like picking up the phone to confirm information before making an **irreversible payment**.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:43:32


Or picking up the phone to do a callback, like every financial institution does when transferring large sums of money. 20th century tech **still works to this day**
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:15:14
Ah, sorry, misread. Nevertheless, I think the potential liability facing the people involved is generally not being discussed.
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:25:52


What you're missing is that corporate officers have a fiduciary duty of care:


So in this case, Pair and Gallippi did not do the **industry standard** phone callback for transferring amounts over $10,000, which could open them up to liability. They're stuck between a rock and a hard place: running out of cash, so might as well try to get the $1mm, and possibly personally liable, so have to spin, shill, sock puppet, and pray for mercy.
@_date: 2015-09-17 16:37:40
"Additionally, advances in bitcoin cybersecurity over the last year allow BitPay to further protect funds and better serve merchants and bitcoin users."
How about not blaming "bitcoin cybersecurity" and taking responsibility for being *easily* socially engineered?
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:07:54


A key control at every company is a phone call for authorization of large transfers. Full stop. You may think this is Monday morning quarterbacking, but from my perspective (surrounded by fairly competent professionals), it's internal control 101.
You are making excuses, hemming and hawing, and generally sound like someone I would fire in short order.


LMAO yes, you have "impersonating the CFO" as a risk. gtfo 
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:41:22
That is so edgy! With the obvious caveat that a business needing a BitLicense isn't really a "bitcoin business", but rather a fiat business that deals in bitcoin.
tldr bitcoin users unaffected, we need people like Lawsky to continue hampering VC-funded middle-men so that Bitcoin doesn't become an AOL-like walled garden.

Meanwhile UBS upgraded to Windows 7 in 2014. Five years after it came out...
@_date: 2015-09-18 00:31:18


It was the CFO's email. A callback means calling someone's phone number, using a telephone, so that you can hear their voice. A callback is indeed one basic thing that can prevent situations like this 99% of the time. The 1% of the time is when the CFO is kidnapped and coerced into confirming the transfer over the phone, or his phone is stolen and the voice is faked (see how these scenarios suddenly require physical access? Enormous difference in difficulty for not getting caught).
I only say this because people like yourself are clearly unfamiliar with the care that goes into transferring large amounts of money and how easy it is to mitigate risks.
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:20:19


You don't know it, but you're part of the cultural problem in Bitcoin.


There are better standards in place, it's called COSO's internal control framework:  
As you point out, it's not fool-proof, but it hits the low hanging fruit.

Exactly, if the block size limit is comparable to monetary policy (which it's not), then big block proponents are inflationists.

You had a direction. You tried to rally. You failed. Hearn moved on to R3CEV. You should move on too. Bitcoin Core will increase the block size limit when it makes sense to do so. Sorry Andresen and Hearn duped you into thinking there's a crisis.
