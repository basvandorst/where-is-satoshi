Yeah thats right. He was bitching about technical debt of SegWit for over a year. now he should either leave bitcoin or oppose 2x since this is shitty code.

It is always a good idea to talk to each other. Seg Wit is a huge step forward and should have been a nobrainer to activate immeadiately but the small group opposing it managed to delay it. As I see it there is a lot of people agreeing that eventually we will need a HF but it shouldnt be an unneccessarry one like 2x. Like you said SegWit will go a long way and there really is no need for using time and energy on a HF now.

Sorry for the little late reply. Look at the lightning network first since it will be deployed first.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:23:11
Yep dont change bitcoin unless it is flawless. Bitcoin doesnt need to change and certainly we dont need the backroom 2x deal. Eventually when all agree that a HF is good it will happen, not before becourse some businesspersons got together. This is the beauty of bitcoin. If they thought they could do it they wouldnt have needed the flawed BTC1 implementation. Expect community to fight back at the 2x part. If you want peace convince the 2x people to call it off and start seriously interacting with the community.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:27:10
Ok I overstated. There is nowhere near consensus for 2x and therefore it shouldnt/will not happen. Lets get back to looking at the beautifull technology of bitcoin and stop this infightning. you will get 2x or similar on chain scalling in a few year a HF is going to happen when we have consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:49:29
It is like boxing, you are only as good as your last fight. I dont care about what Roger, Falkvinge, Vorheer, etc did back in the early days of bitcoin and how lucky they got. All I care is what they are saying now and the immediate past and there they have sucked big time. If they comes around and start working with not against the community i welcome them back but I want trust anyone again based on their past achievements. All that maters is their present actions.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:48:51
No backroom deals. do everything in publi and with consensus.

Buy the bitcoin you plan on spending in the future first and then spend them. Worked great as I normally have purchased more than I eventually spended eventually counting them as my hodled bitcoins.

yep let them feel the pain right away this is the only way he will get the message.

And SegWit2x smells like shit. This is probably why Viabtc moved on to BCASH.

You could get an old phone and install a wallet. save the passphases a safe place and keep the wallet in another place switched off then you are ok for an amount like that. But have control over your own key.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:03:18
Last week two companies dropped out and Viabtc said they would split hashpower between the two chain and F2pool stopped signalling. 
Further support for the no2x keept increasing.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:52:26
I have always used the buy to spend later strategy. Have worked great since I have bought extra before the previous amount have run out thus adding to my position. 
Also I only spend one time with merchants that didnt keep it but just got the fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:09:31
Gold however lasted much longer and was the behind the world currencies stated before 1973. The countries ended up violating the trust of the world reserve currency by printing more money than they had gold.

I got over it and got in at the low 300-1000$ Of course at a much lower volume than I could have wished but Im happy that I finally got in its just to say that this guy probably will look back in a few years and be happy he bought at the top.

@_date: 2017-10-16 07:00:53
They will fail but we need to fight it right to the end. The will probably be stupid enough to do the fork in spite of all the opposition. This will cost them bitcoin and send a lesson for future bad actors. But remember to keep up the pressure and build resistance against this attack.

How is it compared to Circle Pay?
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:58:32
Thats true but once it is there doesnt it have the fiat value and as bitcoin goes up I loose bitcoin. Is there a way of keeping the account in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:16:49
Except he has zero knowlegde of Seg Wit and lightning. Second layer is not the gold standard since the holder still have their bitcoins. He is either uninformed or deliberately spreading misinformation. He confuses second layer with third party.
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:21:12
This is actually a good thing since different exchanges and third party sites like circle, coinbase, ABRA, ... could move to totally of chain interaction boosting bitcoin transaction untill we get second layer going.
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:15:46
Couldnt you try to convince him that breaking up his company in a mining and a hardware company would earn him much respect in the community. It might also make him more profit as people wouldnt be bias against antminer and seeking out alternatives when they become available. Hindering implimentation of Seg Wit due to his ASIC boost is of course not anything that help his reputaion. I do believe however that as soon as we move on, hopefully with a compromise that has general consensus, he will be forgiven. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:22:35
ABRA can be used as wallet with bitcoin if you set the currrency to bitcoin. But be carefull with this  step.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:06:19
I loaned out on BTC jam just to test one year ago. Only 10 USD in BTC one year ago. ATM I doubled in USD but almost halfed my BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:24:10
I just tried again and reset my account to bitcoin. One need to be carefull when starting a wallet and chose bitcoin and not the equivalent fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:42:04
This might not entirely be a bad thing since it decreases the effectiveness of covert ASICS boost that requires empty blocks at times and not taking highest fee transaction into the block. The advantage of ASICS boost will therefore slowly decrease and maybe Jihan will go for Seg Wit anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:39:32

you mean the anti seg wit people doesnt want bitcoin to evolve to a payment network way superior to VISA. This 10 £ could be used to set up a payment channel that could in principle stay open forever. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:55:15
Are Canoe.com and BTC.top controlled by Bitmain otherwise convincing them to switch would leave Bitmain alone on emerging consensus. If they are they are allready alone. It not much in terms of Hashpower but symbolism means a lot.

Wallet providers are no problems as I see it as most allows you to have the value in mbTC ot bits already. Exchanges probably listen to community talk like this one on reddit so allready I think we are influencing them.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:39:00
But thats just not posible. You need to live in the real world and take technical limitation into account. If Seg Wit were adopted we would get a period of lower fee due to the effective 2MB blocksize and much trafic would go off chain so this would lower the on chain fee for a period. However as long as adoptionrate is higher than blocksize increase fee goes up and this is especially true if we were doing transactions on chain person to person for purchases as this increases as the number of persons in bitcoin squared due to Metchalfs law. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:51:12
Hope it will get the chineese miners to see they need to implement seg wit that have consensus in the community. At the moment  i believe all that is needed is Jihan Wu to change his mind and Seg Wit will get activated. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:20:45

Its strange that these thirdparties doesnt do of chain transaction between each other.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:26:46
Its obvious he doesnt like bitcoin he has a gold company and makes money selling gold. However if he had educated himself he could have expanded into bitcoin as well. It makes sence to have both in ones portfolio balanced after risk tolerance.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:30:35
Try showing them third party solution now such as Circle or Coinbase. Then you can send bitcoin for free between those internal wallets. Dont use ABRA by the way as they converts your bitcoin to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:56:45
but technical limits are outside bitcoin since hardware doesnt scale nearly as fast as bitcoin need. We need a solution for bitcoin and unless you are happy with a centralization of bitcoin we cant scale in any meaningfull way on chain. We need a 1000 or higher times increase in tx capability to compete with visa. If current technological progress continue we can scale at least 17%/year according to lukeJR. This is a doubling in 4 years. If we get a compromise of Seg Wit+ 2 MB HF we will get initial 4 MB and with schnoor signatures 8 MB blocksize. If we use the scalling of 17%/year now we will have effective 8 times 8 64 MB in 13 years. This and massive off chain posibilities will mean that we can serve the world in my oppinion. Most people will never go on the mainchain but conduct transaction entirely on Lightning or sidechains. If however we can keep adding 17% a year eventually the mainchain will be accessible again. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:15:19
There is no need to debate Roger since most people are honest and debates favor lying as Roger excells in. Just give him plenty of airtime with a favorable interviewer and he will show how unknowing he is.

@_date: 2017-07-20 09:29:03
I think they either dont trust Jihan will keep signaling and want to keep pressure on them before signalling close to the end or just not ready yet. Another posibility is they are backing out of NYA by not signalling in this period but just signalling SegWit which would be even greater since it would give the HF part of NYA a final blow.

If I understand BIP 91 correctly it only requeres 2 and a half day with 80% to activate. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:20:05
This is great! SegWit gets activated with SegWit2x and all miners that want larger blocks can get on the BCC  wagon. After Segwit activates the 2x part will be forgotten. The BCC token will become worthless and miners will have lost a lot of money.
