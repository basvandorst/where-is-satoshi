Yeah, interesting, I pray for BTC dropping to $6k or so, for the same reason: to buy a bunch.

It's assumed that for the vast majority of everything that every human being in history before and after the Internet has ever typed out or ever spoken has the following unspoken preamble:   "What I'm going to say or type here is just my opinion." 
Bitcoin will go above $70k by this time next year, 2018. 
As a reminder: I actually have no clue, I can't predict the future, and this is just my guess.

Ha, interesting take. Mine is precisely the opposite: anyone who isn't seeing that this will go to $500k isn't seeing the worldwide effect that bitcoin will have. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:34:44
mmm, there are a few more who believe it'll go above $500k: 
It'll hit $20k by March, $50k by end of 2018.

We get it, avi952. 
But unless you're like 16 years old, you have to know that this kind of question is like asking if you should stay or divorce your wife, will gas prices go up tomorrow, is buying my house in Florida a good thing, and if I purchase Apple stock, will it go up or down in January. 
We totally get it: you're new at this. 
But here's the single answer to the rest of your questions on any investment you ever make from here on out until the day you die: we don't know. I'm not being facetious. The single answer to all of your investment questions: we. don't. know.
My guess? Bitcoin will go far, far beyond $100,000 by 2020. I'm multiplying them as fast as I can get them and for the most part, ignoring every naysaying article that says otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:28
Get $1k or $3k together, buy some bitcoin, and don't touch it or watch it or anything until it's well past $500,000. You will not regret it, and you avoid kicking yourself for not having some permanent skin in this revolution. 
There will be a day mid-2018 when people will say, "man, you purchase bitcoin when it was below $50,000? wow, what I wouldn't give for that chance." 
Buy it and just forget about it. It will be one of the best investments of your entire lifetime. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:16:16
$500,000 by 2020.

You're making a very large assumption: that btc is a whopping great and escalating cost to the environment. 
I don't remember the name of this particular logical fallacy. But here's an example: 
"I don't want to douse the enthusiasm here, but is the whopping and well-known environmental cost of my cell phone and laptop and cotton T-shirts that you all own defensible?  Plus the cost of heating your apartment?"

Regular monthly audits would definitely be another higher level of due diligence, and we look forward to that. I think of risk as having layers of due diligence: higher risk is missing some things that would add to safety. Lower risk is having all the things that make us feel safe. Personally, all my biggest financial wins in business have come from entering a market that doesn't yet have all the safety valves in place. Bitcoin at $20 in 2010 was a good example. I ripped a dear friend when she purchase $5k of BTC back then. She sold $2k of it a few years back, but that remaining $3k has done well. 
I have 2 lists of colleagues: those who want to risk a bit in USI and have put their toe into the waters ($500-5,000), and those who think this won't work. I'm enjoying the process.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:35:39
correct, it's a new ballgame. In fact, every ballgame you ever enter will eventually become a new ballgame. Things will change, your friends will change, your favorite websites and projects and passions and towns and ideas and thinking and opinions and car design and cryptocurrency and politics and viewpoints, they will all change. It all changes, it always will always change. And whenever there is money to be made, hallelujah, those particular things will change even faster. Why? Because money is freedom, and people want freedom because it allows them to enter new ballgames.

what he's saying is: BTC will go stratospheric. Stop watching its weekly and quarterly ups and downs. They're irrelevant. You either believe it'll go way into the 6 figures or this isn't the right investment. 
Analogy: imagine this being 2014. You own some BTC and it's just dropped from your $800 to $400. Panic ensues. Now ask your question again.

USI's math works like this: It's an average 40% return over 7 months. 7 months is 28 weeks, or 140 business days (i.e., Monday through Friday each week). Yes, they return 140% of your principle over that time, sending it back to you each working evening at 1/140th at a time, for a total return of 140%.
This means their return is: 
40% in 7 months. Or,
5.7% per month. Or,
1.4% per week. Or,
68% per year.
That's it. It’s a 68% annual return on your investment. That’s excellent, but it’s not outrageous. We all know NASDAQ stock that has gone up 30% in a month. 
An example: if you purchase $1000 today in their Bitcoin Packs, you will get back $1400 worth of BTCs in 7 month’s time. 
True, if the value of BTC goes up in 7 months, then your total BTCs they give back to you will be worth more than $1400. But their return is still 40% increase in 140 business days, which is 7 months, which is 28 weeks. 
But it is their nightly rebuy that makes it much more profitable.  If you choose to reinvest your 1/140th of principle and profit that is returned to you each evening, then that changes everything. You go from a 40% return in 7 months to a 260% return in 7 months. Which turns into a 650% return in 14 months. 
That's because you have changed—daily—what your original investment actually is. You can no longer state "I invested $1,000 over 140 days" because that's no longer true. You are actually investing $1,000 and then the next day you are investing $1003, and then the next day you are investing $1006, and so on. 
Compound interest changes nothing on the original company's historical 40% return over 7 months (i.e., 5.7% a month). It just means that you are investing more and more each day. 
But it explains why for every $1,000 (currently 1.3 BTC) a person invests and leaves in for 
Cycle 1 - ROI = 400% 
Cycle 2 - ROI = 650%
Cycle 3 - ROI = 1400%
Cycle 4 = ROI = 2800%
Cycle 5 = ROI = 5800 %
Cycle 6 = ROI = 11600%
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:36:38
140 business days, x. That's Monday through Friday. Not Monday through Sunday. It's 5 days a week, 20 days a month. Or every 28 weeks, or every 7 months. 
Use this calendar to figure out when each 140-business day begins and ends:

I saw those, but wasn't sure how to translate them. On Coinbase, do they charge 4% for all transactions, plus their additional fees? 
Here's what I'm seeing on Coinbase: 
Base rate of 4% for all transactions**
U.S. Bank Account	1.49%
Coinbase USD Wallet	1.49%
Credit/Debit Card	3.99%

Life is a gamble. If you gamble safe, you get that. I have a neighbor who worked for the Post Office for 30 years. That was her gamble. I have a family member who gambled on $10,000 in gold bullion. That was 7 years ago, she's made $400. (recently said fuck it and put it all into BTC). 
Here's my prediction, and it is worth just under 2¢ on the open market: 1 BTC will be worth $250,000 in the next 10 years. 
But all life is a gamble. Your marriage is a gamble, your car you buy, your airplane flight next week. Read, watch, feel your gut, and then make a damn decision. But whatever you do, learn to avoid living in fear. Avoid that like the plague.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:09:27
Yeah, my strategy is to multiply as many BTC as possible in the next few years. I believe it'll climb well past $100,000 and so I don't care about its ups and downs along the way. Just want to get about 40 or so of them between now and then.

Apologies, I wasn't trying to be dismissive or rude, truly. 
My sense is that cryptocurrency is like the Internet back in 1985: no one could really picture in their mind what it could do, or where it would go, and it's the same with this. Any definition any of us try to put onto blockchain and cc will be limited at best. It's massively bigger and different than our brains can imagine. What any of us thought about Bitcoin in 2012 isn't correct. Same with 2017. I just trust that it's going to be a phenomenal force for good. And, if done right and it's what we want, it'll make us very wealthy.  And there are life-changing things we can do for others with that wealth.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:13:19
We've been with USI a month and are very happy. We're long-time investors, and did more due diligence on these guys than anything we've done. In a year from now, we believe they'll be in the top 3 BTC miners in the world, and a lot more acceptable to many. But we like to get in during the phase when most people aren't comfortable, or in this case, call them a ponzi. Happy to report our returns over the next 2 or 3 years as we go forward.

You're quoting an maxim, also known as an axiom and platitude. But theses fixed phrases are also known as extraordinarily damaging cliches passing off as true. 
Here's another: 
*"Don't put all your eggs in one basket."*
There is not one single person on the planet who wishes they hadn't put every single egg of theirs into Bitcoin in 2011. Not some or a few of their egg$, but all of their eggs. Do the math: a small $10k investment would now be worth $550 million. A 20k worth 1.1Billion, a 50k worth 2.5 billion. You say "well I didn't have $50k back in 2011 to invest? Bullshit. Sell your house. Live in a trailer, eat rice most days, pull out the max on your credit cards. 
Maxims can be really useful in life, because they are often based on the majority of experiences. However—and this is huge life-saving however—if you follow them blindly or worse have them in your subconscious, they the run your life and you don't pay attention. Great financial success often requires risk; putting money into something that others aren't. 
You either believe that Bitcoin will go far above $100k or you don't. Cool either way, because like every bet in life, one side will be wrong and no one knows. 
Every person ever alive is betting on their horse (or horses).

True. No one knows. Even those who sat around that dorm room and listened to an Asperger's socially awkward kid describe a new social media platform he was creating and asking to invest $10k. Zuck's idea could've gone both ways, and I wonder if I would've been one of the 99.999% who would've told him no way, or been the one to believe. I'm not sure. But BTC? My bet is that it's a Zuckerberg dorm room moment, and the more chicken little behavior there is, the faster we can accrue coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:33:51
Ok, so here are my first results. I started November 2nd, and it's now November 13th. That's 7 working days. My average daily is around 0.92% each day. 
I borrowed $30k on a line of credit (at 5% interest), and as of today, my returns are 0.408 BTC each working day, or $275. About 40% of that is profit, or $110/day. Since there are around 20 working days a month, that's $2,200 a month in passive income. 
My plan is to keep the $30k working for 2 full cycles (14 months). At that time, if the returns remain steady, I should have just over $300,000 in today's BTC value. Since BTC will probably go up by then, the returns could be much higher. I'll let pull out my $30k loan and pay that off, and then decide from there how much to keep going in the UTC market.
