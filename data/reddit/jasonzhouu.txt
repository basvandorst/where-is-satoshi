I don’t think download blockchain from AWS server owned by yourself is a good idea. It’s one to one data transfer which may be much slower than bitcoin’s built in one to many P2P transfer.

- `bitcoin-cli help` shows the **command list**.
- `bitcoin-cli -help` or `man bitcoin-cli` shows **available parameters**

It's dangerous only when the new cryptocurrency's mining algorithm is compatible with existing mining machine, including GPU and various kinds of ASICs.
If the new PoW cryptocurrency is created with a new mining algorithm, whose ASICs is manufactured by themself or collaborators, then it will be safe.
For example SiaCoin's ASIC is manufactured by Sia's parent compnay Nebulous. And when Bitmain released ASICs for SiaCoin, then it hard forked.
