The French don't like cash much. There is a resentment that gets reflected towards people that use it for anything more than a a few euros.
The government likes to get their 20 percent on each transaction and have been bastardizing cash for a long time.
I think currently any national needs to file paperwork to use more than a thousand euros in cash. For immigrants its anything over 3k.
To buy any amount of over the counter bitcoin here you need to file paperwork.
