We all get mad and spit out spur-of-the-moment threats, but I'm curious, in your experience, how often is pain (or more) inflicted on someone?  Would you say 1:10 or 1:20ish?  Lower ratio for more serious events?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:56:10
Yeah, I wasn't sure about that.  Will read up on events at lunch (hopefully).
Looks like the U.S. just sued Mt. Gox for misappropriation of users' funds.  No real surprise there.
Also, I'm not a Bitcoin investor, just a fan.  Still a curiosity to me, but I like the concept behind it (and other virtual money platforms).

Well, do you guys think some of the posts are relevant?  Looks like a pretty straight-forward news feed, so I thought it might be appropriate to bring it to the attention of Reddit users.
There's also a slew of other Bitcoin accounts on Twitter for individual exchanges, websites, and enthusiasts.  It'd be great to compile a list of some of the best Bitcoin accounts on Twitter to follow.

Beware = Be aware.  Looks like he just wants to bring Bitcoin to your attention, that's all!

Anyone else want to fire this baby up with me?  Show of hands?

While Overstock.com has $3 shipping, is it two-day shipping?  Guaranteed?  Do you get a Netflix-like account for streaming content along with it?  Can you borrow books from a digital library and read them on a (relatively) low-cost e-reader?
I'm not putting down your comment, but as an Amazon Prime sub, I see a lot of benefit from the $79/yr. fee.  If Overstock.com started doing the same thing, it would be a game-changer, IMHO.
Disclosure: I'm not an Amazon employee nor am I invested in its stock.

Not going to lie, Byrne looks completely different in GW and BI photos.

Isn't there like a shit-ton of digital currencies out there right now?  (I don't really know this.)  I think it would be survival of the fittest for Bitcoin, dogecoin, etc., though MasterCard coming up with something like 'Mastercoin' would get my vote.
I think easier to spend isn't necessarily the purpose of Bitcoin so much as avoiding taxes, ease of transfer, and so on.  Companies like Square and PayPal are working on more NFC- and Bluetooth-equipped methods of payment, which probably haven't caught on as much as they should given that the public is still at-arms over security behind such endeavors.
Funnily enough, most don't realize how much information is stored on a device (smartphone) which could easily be dropped/lost/stolen.  Think of how much info is kept in apps like Amazon.com and eBay.  It's nuts.

Sorry about my first comment, too.  At work (trying to kill off New Year's Eve + a snow day) and didn't full read the initial post.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:11:52
Sorry, didn't even see that this was literally from this thread. Just thought it was funny.

[Here's a good example]( from Coca-Cola.  The market cap on that company is $120 billion and they put out a PR for donations of $8.3 million made over three months to "help" 3.8 million people, or $2.18 per person.
I agree with you that stuff like this is mostly PR...and that's my gripe.  When I drop a buck or two into the Salvation Army ringer's bucket outside of my location grocery store, I'm not going to turn around and put that up on Facebook/Twitter just so people see how great I am.  Coincidentally, $1 or $2 to me is exactly like $8.3 million to Coca-Cola.
But, that's corporate America.  "Look how much we're doing for the poor!  Buy Coke!"
EDIT:  I'm also confident that there are companies everywhere that donate and don't put out a PR about it.  Those are the companies I want to give my business.

Why can't charities take money donated and advertise?  Like I don't need to know every time an S&amp;P 500-sized company charitably gives $100,000 to the March of Dimes.  While it's a good thing, $100,000 to a massive company is nothing and seems more like gloating.  I'm less likely to donate after I see that.
