He's still fighting the charges, out on bail, but can't leave the US. (I also think he's not allowed to work/earn money while in the states, so he's supported by friends and EFF).

There's free food and water in jail... just saying. I think the court's logic is that if someone has money to make bail, (even if they aren't citizens) then there's a support network that could keep that person from starving. Of course there's always the option of getting into real debt (as if lawyers fees weren't enough).

To wire someone $2000 using a bank will cost you upwards of $30. We can't speculate on the transaction costs of cryptocurrency 24 years from now, but the idea is that the transaction costs would replace the mining award for finding a new block. The market would establish a balance between the cost of mining VS incentivizing miners to continue mining by paying transaction fees VS keeping the overall cost to transact competitive with traditional banking. The reality is that if bitcoin doesn't work in 2040, the community can always hard fork.
