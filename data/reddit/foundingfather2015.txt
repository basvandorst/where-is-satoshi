If the government tracked all transactions and the time delay in/out of a mixer is relatively small, the probability they can track the payments is almost guaranteed. 
I'm a Bitcoin nube, but why not just anonymously create lots of wallets/addresses?(on an anonymous device).  Every transaction is always split into a standard size(say 1BTC) and goes into different wallets.  When you want to spend and the amount requires more than what is in one wallet, you add multiple to perform the transaction.  The wallets are only used twice and tossed(once to receive...once to spend).   Only the spender is likely to be correlated, but if you perform the transaction at a coffee shop and its never used again, correlation is difficult.   Since all the sizes are the same its hard to know who owns what.  you'll see lots of wallets consolidated on a purchase and a lot get sent out...  could be 1 to N people.  If some mixer worked this way, as long as they properly encrypt the consolidation of wallets and had enough transactions, there's almost no way to know.

Isn't that odd, CMU did nothing wrong for a subpoena to be granted to the FBI over their findings.  Seem more like a reason for CMU to continue their hand-in-hand operations with the FBI.  Shhh we'll continue to get grants for our CS dept.

Welcome to the age of the Bankers.  Their goal is to suppress or control anything that is not fiat dollars.  Is it possible this is a manipulated market like precious medals?.  Didn't a bunch of bankers started buying into the bitcoin technology last year?   Probably bought up a lot of bitcoins so they could manipulate it similarly to the stock market.
