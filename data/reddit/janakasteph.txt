IndieGogo Fundraising - The blockchain technology and his new ecosystem under construction allow us to start building a new form of political system, a digital consensus infrastructure to underpins socio-politic actions. The envisioned system is open source, based on cryptography, backed by real persons working on the ground to release actual achievements. The goal is to make a digital platform that empowers many small local communities. They can refer to the blockchain as the Authority. People can build political parties to convey a specific view of the life they want and satisfy a positive sense of belonging. After the release of the political system 1.0, people will be able to meet in real life and build their future with the community they choose.

Yes it is really fast. Most of the delay you observe comes from the Youtube livestream. Thank you for your support!

No it's a PGP public key. It's written in the PEM header.

I opened this issue to ask for documentation on how to verify software integrity. [

First, we have to distinguish between a funding transaction that creates a p2wsh output and a spending transaction that spends it. Which one interests you? When you spend, you have to provide the script in the witness data.
When it comes to size, Bitcoin also multiple units of measurement, bytes, vbytes and weight. With Segregated Witness, the block size limit is *no longer measured in bytes*. Instead, blocks and transactions are given a new metric called “weight”. A block has a maximum weight of 4,000,000. A typical byte in a transaction weighs 4, and a witness byte (script, signatures, ...) in a transaction weighs 1.
To calculate a byte length you have this helper method  
So, I don't have the exact formula for you, but hope it helps a bit.
