Honestly I think you should walk away - I don't think this is for you.

I'm just annoyed at myself for not trusting my gut and buying when it was down at the ~$9,500 mark - I knew it'd rebound somewhat.

I bought in November.. not very much, about 0.12 BTC. I resisted the urge to cash out when it hit it's all time high - somehow in my gut I knew this was a peak which wouldn't be sustainable but I held on, and am holding on all the way back down.
I only invested what I could afford to lose and whilst it'd suck, if it drops to 0, it won't matter. But I'll of course be hoping it rallies again.

Can only assume once the congestion eases, and once Christmas is out of the way, we might start to see some steady gains again.

Thought I had missed the boat 4 years ago. Made an account on Blockchain then didn’t bother buying anything. FML.

I did read unbelievable posts on here only a few weeks ago, of people asking whether they should take cash out of their mortgage or take out a loan (!!) to buy bitcoin.. it's no wonder that people end up getting into such terrible financial difficulties with decision making abilities like that.

If you're poor, then don't. Can you afford to completely lose the money you're putting into bitcoin? If the answer is no, then stay away.

Let it keep dropping.. doesn't seem like it's done yet!

Fairly prominent front page article on the Financial Times today too.

Google Translate does a good translation: 
19: 25 JST South Korea's virtual currency exchange Ubit is reported to apply for bankruptcy. Korea's virtual currency exchanges Ebbit reportedly announced on Wednesday that they will close banks for closing the exchange.
According to the Korean newspaper, the exchange seems to have stolen about 4,000 bit coins at the first hacking attack (April), which is believed to have involved North Korea.
On the website, the exchange announced that it lost 17% of the total assets under the hacking attack that became the second time this year at 4:35 am local time 19th. Although it does not clarify the details of the loss amount, it seems to explain that the evaluation value of the virtual currency assets of all customers is reduced to 75%. Also, the deal has already stopped.
The scale of Ubits in the Korean virtual currency market is relatively small, but it seems to be a negative material because it is conscious of the high risk of cyber attacks in the virtual currency.

I guess For those that have been into bitcoin longer than a few days, this isn't their first rodeo.

Don't be so f stupid. Tell your girlfriend to sink herself if she wants to get into terrible debt. Don't you do it. 
Spend only what you can afford to lose. Nothing more.

Coinbase seems to cope just fine until America wakes up! ;)

So I only recently got into Bitcoin - bought a small amount (based on an amount I could afford to lose) and so far am having a hard time believing my eyes in terms of what is going on but it's good fun.
But I just wanted to share one of those "what if" stories.. I was going back through some old emails and found I'd registered an account on Blockchain 4 years ago, presumably with a view to buying some Bitcoin but clearly never got that far.  Amusingly, looking back at my emails, I despondently said to a friend that I had "missed the boat on bitcoin" and that it wasn't worth putting any money into. Holy fuck am I kicking myself now. 
I excitedly went through old account information, found the details, and logged in hoping that some bitcoin had been accidentally dumped into that account but alas, the cupboards were bare. 
Ho hum.

Sorry yeah.. just found as much. The mobile app simply fails to login, but the proper website gives a notification page.

Totally. It's simply not possible to give advice when you're seeing the absolute insanity that's happened in the last 24 hours or so, and especially when the most popular trading platforms / exchanges are completely hosed due to load. I had a browser window open for GDAX out of the corner of my eye earlier.. I looked away for two minutes and the value of bitcoin had just gone up 2% - in a matter of minutes. It's nuts. 
It's just... if you have money to spare, take a ticket and jump on the crazy train. If you're risk adverse or you would be in difficulty if you lost what you "gambled", stay the hell away. That's about all I would want to say right now.

Coinbase broken again? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:01
Welp. I bought in late October with smaller incremental purchases since so am not a million miles away at this point from levelling out on what I put in vs what it’s worth. This really is my first test to just... hold on. Written the money off in my mind already so time to buckle my seatbelt.

I may take a look at Litecoin. And some of the forks of Bitcoin - though the politics around those is a bit tiresome. Don't know yet.

I think you are right in a lot of respects but honestly for me this was an amount I could afford to lose.. and my thinking was if it doubles or triples then awesome, I made a little money with virtually no effort - and if I lose it well, at least I had a dabble. Right now knowing nothing about the market this is nothing more than gambling it at the casino and I am fine with that.

Noticed the same pattern on Coinbase - LTC, BTC and ETH all look identical in how they've risen and fallen in the last 24 hours or so. It's.... a bit weird. Would love an explanation from someone a bit more clued up. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:19:17
I just bought in recently (not very much.. like 0.10 btc..) but yeah.. checking it multiple times per day. Hoping I can get over that soon.
