It won't make too many too rich. Most holders will sell most of their coins when it hits 10K, the rest will sell when it hits 100K. Very few will become very rich and hold out till it's 1M. And, all these holders deserve to be rewarded, they invested in a super risky brand new asset form, and helped kick start a whole new more efficient financial system. The few million gains they earn is peanuts compared to the trillions Bitcoin can and will save for the global economy on the long term.

The rise will inevitably happen, but won't happen as we expect it. It will be triggered by a series of events we don't currently anticipate (not the halving, not the capacity increases), and will happen at a time, and at scale we don't anticipate either. It will be 'WTF, I knew I should've bought more' moment.

Bitcoin is software that can be upgraded to an encryption that is safe from quantum brute force, so there is no major issue.
However we could recover some lost coins, potentially inflating Bitcoin.
On the other hand it's likely that Bitcoin will move faster than the rest of the financial world, making Bitcoin a safer place to store your digital money than even in banks, which may increase the demand for BTC.

This is cool, but big industry import/export (~US$ 100M+ transactions) can't use bitcoin yet, because the market capital is too small, and there is not enough traders to support a large sell or buy without moving the exchange rate, which is a requirement for trade. The highest transactions feasible right now are still below US$ 1M, and at current price big traders aren't interested in BTC, because they can't make enough money on small margins.
This is why we need a US$ 100K- $1M / 1 BTC price. At every 10x increase BTC will find a new use case. Bigger trading firms will join in, and bigger businesses will use the currency.

QR code is good. The bitcoin address isn't, because it's capitalized with CSS I assume.
1GV1RBESJEGYID9EBNNPHCHJCCHQWUTSSV is not the same address as your real address 1Gv1rBESJEGyid9ebnNPHChJCcHQwuTSsv

You have to see if your time and attention watching and predicting price movements up and down worth it or not? Will you make thousands by trading or only hundreds of dollars?
It's very likely you can make more money by focusing on your job more than trying to trade.
If you believe in Bitcoin's fundamentals, just buy back and consider it as a hedge against traditional assets collapsing, and a diversification of your savings. You have to accept that Bitcoin price may go down to $200 and hope it will go to $2,000. You shouldn't try to win all the time, and worry when the price goes down.
Also, your BTC investment isn't just an investment in a monetary sense. It's also a vote for the values Bitcoin represent and support of the Bitcoin economy. It's bigger than just monetary gains.

@_date: 2016-04-07 17:35:07
The problem with such speculations is that people build the ideas into their thinking, thus they alter the situation making the base of speculation obsolete.
The only reason BTC would go up to $600-800 is if people believed it will go beyond $1,000 and soon. Not a significant number of people realistically believe that halving will push the price beyond $1,000, thus nobody will buy in at $600 or $800 either.
The price will go up but just a bit, maybe 10%-15% to the $500 range at most in result of less coins being in the market available for sale. But as price reaches $500 the balance gets established again without any artificial push by speculators, because it will be just enough to sell of currently mined and withheld coins and coins mined after halving.
The price will go into the $1,000 range but not because of halving. It will happen because of a series of events we don't currently foresee.

'No limit token creation adjusted based on usage' sounds extremely dangerous, and extremely tempting for all validators to collude and manipulate. They could literally print money out of thin air, and get away with it unless everyone wants to cash out all at once.
Fractional reserve banking reinvented by a private corporation. Almost certainly a bunch of people will lose a lot of money on this on the long term when the word or just a rumour gets out that Libra is not backed by enough assets. They would have to prove that they have the assets in real time, I doubt they will do that.
Also, the 'backing of fiat' is not really a backing of any kind, because none of these fiats by definition are backed by gold anymore either. Not even the oldest one, the pound sterling. 
So, you're basically taking on even more risk by holding Libra, than just holding USD alone, because with Libra you have to trust Libra's companies not to collude on top of all the governments who are 'backing' it.

Gotcha. But different layers have different risk levels. I don’t think the merchant will keep a $1M channel open and sell you a yacht for $1M on LN. Or they do, they won’t give the yacht until they safely closed the channel. They will sell you a day trip for $200, but for that money it’s not worth trying to burn their building. :)

I agree, it's not likely. Many of the politicians who may have the influence to force a global crypto ban are invested in it themselves, and they benefit from a crypto hedge in case fiat goes south. Some other politicians are genuinely well informed and good people at heart and understand the importance of supporting economic freedoms, thus they would oppose a crypto ban. With every passing day a global ban is less and less likely or possible.
We had a similar situation with the internet. It was scary for the powers to lose control over mass media, and many wanted to stop it or control it. But instead powers started to slowly invest in internet tech, and some realised its huge potential. Finally, it was embraced even though it meant traditional media that once ruled started to take a nosedive. There used to be thousands of newspapers and magazines, thousands of TV channels, thousands of radio channels. Now, only a fraction remains, because the web, netflix, and streaming music all enabled by the internet rules.
Same with crypto. Now, it may be scary for some, but soon personal banks in your pocket, peer-to-peer finance, money streaming, etc. will be the norm in 20 years.

They can send letters to ecosystem players: Coinbase, Bitpay, Cash App, Gemini, Kraken, XAPO, Bitrefill, Bitnovo, and dozens of others. They CAN do this theoretically in a crypto doomsday scenario. The US government CAN reach out to other countries and pressure them to take action too. Remember BTC-E? If they did this, most companies will cooperate, because they have no choice.
China will likely cooperate and shut down most mining in China. Bitcoin's difficulty will eventually readjust, but there will be short term disruption to security.
The governments could also make crypto use illegal so there will be a massive panic selloff before the law takes effect. And the user base fuelling remaining companies would disappear. Many of the remaining companies would close down.
However, this won't be the end of Bitcoin. We may see a 98% pullback. This will be an incredible buying opportunity for smart money to load up on Bitcoin. It's like a time travel back to early 2013.
After a few months a bounce back will start to form. Companies will find ways to operate outside of regulated jurisdictions. People will find ways to run wallets in ways that is either not detectable or outside of regulated jurisdictions. Many crypto believers move out of non-crypto friendly countries and form their own communities in the remaining free pockets of the world. Lots of unexpected ideas, and activity creates a new Bitcoin ecosystem. The price starts to recover, but still way lower than ATH.
After some years, governments change, and due to pressures from various sides regulations will become less strict. If nothing else, some influential and corrupt politicians will see the opportunity to buy up a bunch of Bitcoin and then introduce bills to loosen up the regulations to make a quick buck. Slowly, crypto seeps back to to every day life. Price starts to rise. Fiat starts to collapse. Bitcoin become more resilient and battle hardened than ever before.

That's true, but even if we started on the blocksize issue Today it won't happen for another 6 month or more anyway. So the incentive to implement Segwit is there anyway. And in addition to that segwit will be cheaper to send even after a blocksize increase. Even if the fees are back to $1, it makes sense to save 50%.

This is a welcome update. Reduces the number of required on chain transactions by half to manage your LN wallet. Previously you had to fund on chain your wallet and then open a channel from the wallet. Same on closing channels. Now you don’t need the intermediary step. Very cool.

With a blocksize increase the options for Joe are:
1. Use on-chain bitcoin for $1
2. Switch to LN and keep using bitcoin for $0.001
3. Switch to alt for $0.01
Result: Many people stay on bitcoin using option 1. or 2. No incentive to switch to alt.
Without blocksize increase the options are:
1. Use on-chain bitcoin for $20
2. Switch to alt for $0.01
Result: Many switch to alt. Only high value use case stays with bitcoin.

If they can collude to that level, they could just change the code entirely by hardforking the coin and leaving the real bitcoin dead. Not a real threat.

Two options:
1. All of it. Transition the whole country to Bitcoin. Buy miners of your own to secure the network. Pay developers to strengthen the Bitcoin code, and develop services around it. Enjoy the efficiencies gained by using crypto in the economy which will realize a few percentage points of GDP growth for several years to come helping everyone in Canada.
2. As a hedge against other currencies and assets buy 0.1%-1%. The fact that Canada holds it as a reserve currency would strengthen Bitcoin enough that it will almost certainly make the bet a good one, which may increase the total value of the reserve by several percents just because of the small bitcoin ratio within the next few years. Other than that, it won't help the economy or wellbeing in Canada.
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:26:44
How is this relevant to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:45:34
People in general and even experts in a certain narrow field are typically unable to imagine and thus predict exponential growth even though they know most about their own field. The great majority of experts think of the future linearly instead of exponentially according to research. You can read Kurzweil's books on this subject. Ray has been giving us surprisingly precise predictions that are continuously verified by events, so we can trust his opinion.
Many experts Today are likely to be wrong on the rate of increase and development in terms of social and democratic openness including China, internet connectivity and speeds (especially in China), technological advances including energy production and its price or storage and processing speeds, and of course required Bitcoin blocksize.
BIP202 is a great compromise for all including the pessimistic (realistic in their view) experts. But 202 will still leave Bitcoin's blocksize too small to be able to realize its full potential. Businesses in the next few years will be forced to consider alternative blockchains that have a larger bandwidth than Bitcoin's 7-10tps, such as Litecoin (28tps), Ethereum (no blocksize limit, currently around 20tps and increasing), and new altcoins they may create for their purposes. Bitcoin won't die, but it won't be the only important blockchain in the future. It will be one of the big and trusted ones. The difference in market capitalization between Bitcoin and other coins will decrease over time.
This is probably a good thing for us in general as we don't want to rely on a single Blockchain for all our needs. It would be safer to use several slightly different ones for various purposes. Although there is no problem with using one "Internet" for example with insignificant other worldwide networks, so one blockchain to rule them all could work too.
Regardless, I think on the short term BIP202 is a good idea, and it will also give precedent that Bitcoin can improve with time, which is a good signal to investors. This precedent may also make it easier to hard fork again in the future when the need arises, which is almost certain in my opinion.

New technologies tend to disrupt old paradigms, but that's not their major accomplishment in general. It's the new things they can offer that matters. 
For example the first computers with word processors did disrupt the typewriter, but is making a better typewriter the biggest accomplishment here? No. It's the ability to save, duplicate infinitely, share your documents for further editing, run a spell check, etc. which weren't typewriter features. We still have typewriters, but not many. 
Let's take an industry that is more like bitcoin, which relies on the network effect: Mail. We still get mail even though email replaced 99.9% of all mail sent. The benefit wasn't just faster mails. The main reason email succeeded was the ability to easily organize lots of incoming information which was essential for more effective business operations. Also, it allowed links and attachments, etc. It's the add ons that make it really valuable. 
In case of bitcoin, we shouldn't measure its success by its ability to replace old paradigms. The value will likely to come from new uses that VISA currently doesn't have. For example the ability to freely 'open accounts' without anybody checking your credit history. The ability to attach smart contracts to transactions and other things we are only just hypothesizing about at this point.

@_date: 2015-12-08 21:40:06
Yes, in order to learn how to use bitcoin. This knowledge on its own is worth the investment and effort. It may help your business or private life in unexpected ways.
For investment any small amount is good as a hedge against other savings you may have. There is a small but not negligible chance that the bitcoin price may skyrocket thanks to a series of announcements that are currently in development. Your $100 could easily worth $1,000 in a year, which isn't much, but it can compensate for the falling dollar for example.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:44:21
Based on my personal experience of asking people about Bitcoin all around the world, less than 1 in 10 people know about Bitcoin. When they do know about its existence, they don't know the benefits of it, and never thought about investing or opening a wallet. I think we still have at least 10x bigger potential investor pool to join in eventually in the next 3-5 years.
Also the price will grow with non-investor adoption rate too. If a few million people simply use it and hold some for everyday things, like they hold some money on their PayPal accounts (without being PayPal investors) that would push the price to the thousands, because there isn't enough BTC to go around.
We only need a few thousand extra people to hold an average of 0.5 BTC every day to keep the price steady. If we get just a few percent more new users, the price has to start climbing. A moderately successful online game generates many more paying customers. We only need one killer bitcoin app that goes viral and the price will go through the roof.
With hundreds of projects around Bitcoin the massive success of at least one is almost guaranteed, it's just a matter of when, not if.

The two can happen at the same time. If the value of Bitcoin grows at a slow and steady pace of 1.12% a month it goes to the moon, yet the volatility is very low. At this rate you would be doubling your money every 5 years. Really good long term investment.
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:09:06
The upside of a successful hard-fork is also to demonstrate that Bitcoin can evolve with needs, which also means it's future proof essentially forever.
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:19:09
Yeah, depends how you define small. Small are countries like Slovakia and Croatia for me with 3-4M. Medium are like Belgium or Hungary at 10M. And large are like Italy or Germany.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:29:06
21M BTC unless we hard fork Bitcoin in the future to have a different limit. ;)
Also, Bitcoin is just one of the cryptos, the supply of Bitcoin like tokens is truly unlimited. Granted other crypto coins are less valuable because less people use them, but over time their adoption will inevitably grow and interchangeability between any crypto and fiat will be a non issue, thus they will inflate cryptos in general influencing Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:24:32
I don't think that's correct. In my experience it is doubling equally. There is demand for upstream video at higher and higher quality. People want to see clear Skype calls. They want to have internet on 5+ devices at once. People are expecting to be able to backup to the cloud terrabytes of data in a reasonable amount of time. They upload streaming video from their security cameras. The list of use cases is endless.
@_date: 2015-06-24 03:13:57
I appreciate that the argument was laid out in a fair way even if I disagree with it. However I do not appreciate that no solution was put forward.
To me if the cap isn't increased or lifted altogether it would not only mean that Bitcoin may never go global even with sidechains, but most importantly it also would mean Bitcoin in general is unable to improve and thus will eventually become obsolete compared to new cryptos. This would be very sad because the huge user base of Bitcoin is a great value that I don't want to see eroded by other cryptos for no good reason. We need one serious international decentralized independent currency in the World that everyone can use, and Bitcoin has the potential to become that currency.
We may be risking a hypothetical split of Bitcoin with a hard fork, which is scary for sure (although nobody would lose their coins technically if they wait out which chain wins eventually). However we're almost guaranteeing "the split" of the Bitcoin user base if we don't do it, because Bitcoin won't be competitive. And this would eventually make Bitcoin less valuable and useful for all.
Upgrading to 8MB+ is the less risky option in my view.

Any reason we can't decrease the confirmation time from 10 mins to 5 or 2.5 mins like Litecoin? Has the 2.5 min confirmation time caused any issues with Litecoin? It will still be incredibly hard to perform an attack at 5 mins, but the utility of Bitcoin would increase a lot in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:36:05
All transactions that involve a partner I don't have full trust for. For example if I'm a merchant and somebody buys a computer I will not let them out of the store before I have at least one confirmation. 1 weak confirmation is better than none. None means they could be attempting a double spend. 1 confirmation instantly removes the majority of my doubt. I think this is rational, but even if mathematically it makes no sense, the perception is very important too.
I'm aware there are solutions that give you a very high confidence level based on trustworthiness without confirmations and it goes up with every second, but it would be great if the blockchain itself performed this function.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:37:00
I think it's amazing that such a question even asked. :O But it would make total sense to use Bitcoin to diversify assets as it's largely independent from every other traditional asset, which is the most important thing for risk reduction.

Well, if they spent 2 years ramping up the production of miners to match Today's hashrate it would be useless for an attack. They not only have to match but also significantly outpace the current rather aggressive growth of hashpower. I think the 1B is not exaggerated at all. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:55:31

@_date: 2015-06-16 16:49:24
The price is going up because some people in the know are buying some of the bitcoin just in case. And this little extra influx of money gave a signal to the traders to buy. But it could be just a fluctuation, and it will all collapse to under $200 next week. Or I have no idea. :)

All transactions that involve a partner I don't have full trust for. For example if I'm a merchant and somebody buys a computer I will not let them out of the store before I have at least one confirmation. 1 weak confirmation is better than none. None means they could be attempting a double spend. 1 confirmation instantly removes the majority of my doubt. I think this is rational, but even if mathematically it makes no sense, the perception is very important too.
I'm aware there are solutions that give you a very high confidence level based on trustworthiness without confirmations and it goes up with every second, but it would be great if the blockchain itself performed this function.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:38:00
This is great, but I don't really have a use case to buy any other crypto other than BTC for now. Any private person or company I know only accepts BTC. How about you guys?
@_date: 2015-06-24 03:28:02
Yes, that's true, but no change also proves that Bitcoin will forever stay "play money" and never enter serious business because it simply can't handle it. Some other crypto will come and take that function from Bitcoin.
If hypothetically 75% of people agreed that the 21M BTC cap should be lifted in order for Bitcoin to preserve its value, it would make sense to do just that.
Would you rather see Bitcoin's value go to zero if that's the cost of preserving the rules or would you rather see a constantly evolving and bettering Bitcoin that is ever increasing in utility and value?
The 1MB cap wasn't the original rule anyway. It was put in temporarily. So it wouldn't be the first case this rule is meddled with. At the time that rule made sense, now Bitcoin is becoming bigger and needs a new rule to grow further.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:25:48
I think the 1000 satoshi fee is very reasonable as long as BTC is below $1,000. It's a good way to incentivize development, which serves the user on the long term.
There are many options for wallets so users don't have to pay if they don't want to. They can also fork MultiBit if they want to run their own version.

Even if we have several side chains, those side chains have to touch the bitcoin blockchain regularly. Also, we should consider that more and more internet enabled machines will start making automated transactions increasing the required capacity.
@_date: 2015-06-14 05:00:23
Yes, both is the way forward in my view too. Instantaneousness and scale for micro-transaction on Lightning is great, but the core needs to be scaled too to handle the many new layers that are coming to Bitcoin.

What good would do to attack pools? Miners would just point their hash power to other pools that are not under attack. Or if all pools are attacked, they could solo mine. It's not as as easy to real-life brute force the hash power as you suggest.

Financial inclusion or inclusive financing is the delivery of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society, in contrast to financial exclusion where those services are not available or affordable. Bitcoin can really excel here.
Quotes from the report:
"In EMDCs, ensuring financial deepening is accompanied with greater financial inclusion and creating incentives for lowering informality would be important. More generally, complementarities between growth and income equality objectives suggest that policies aimed at raising average living standards can also influence the distribution of income and ensure a more inclusive prosperity."
"Disparities in financial services access. There are large disparities in the use of financial services between advanced economies and EMDCs and across income levels within a country. More than 80 percent of adults in advanced economies have an account at a formal financial institution—twice more than in EMDCs. Within EMDCs, the share of adults with an account or a loan at a formal financial institution is largely skewed toward the top income earners. The rest rely on their own limited savings to invest in education or become entrepreneurs, suggesting that financial inequality and income inequality go hand in hand. In many EMDCs, low-income households and small-scale firms often face challenges in accessing financial services due to lack of financial knowledge, complicated processes, onerous paperwork, and other market failures. Moreover, available financial products tend to be more limited and relatively costly."
" Financial deepening can provide households and firms with greater access to resources to meet their financial needs, such as saving for retirement, investing in education, capitalizing on business opportunities, and confronting shocks. Financial deepening accompanied by more inclusive financial systems can thus lower income inequality, while improving the allocation of resources (Dabla-Norris and others 2015). Theory, however, suggests that financial development could benefit the rich in the early stages of development, but the benefits become more broadly shared as economies develop (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990). Indeed, some studies have found that financial development, measured as the relative share of the banking and stock market sectors in the economy, boosts top incomes the most in the early stages of development (Roine, Vlachos, and Waldenström 2009). Moreover, inequality can increase as those with higher incomes and assets have a disproportionately larger share of access to finance, serving to further increase the skill premium, and potentially the return to capital (Claessens and Perotti 2007). "

It would work. This is going to be the next step in crypto currencies. Centrally released government cryptos that will be compatible and exchangeable with traditional currencies. Once the infrastructure is ready the non-crypto national currency will be made obsolete.
Canada already tried doing this with Mint a few years ago, but they didn't use a crypto. Canada has a crypto friendly government and eager to create efficiencies in the market. I can totally see them creating a CryptoCAD (CCAD) which will be exchangeable with CAD 1:1. It would be mineable but only for transaction fees and banks will get in on the game first, but everyone will have the chance to participate on a tiny scale if they wanted to.

There is lots of buying happening, it's just off exchanges, which means the price doesn't move up in result.
Just think about it. If you had 100M$ to invest what would you do? Buy it on an exchange? No.
You would buy $95M off exchange slowly over a few months and dumping some of your BTC any time the price wants to go up. You need to buy it directly from miners or early investors. This isn't easy or fast. But it's all worth it over a long period of time.
Once you have 95% of the BTC you want, you go to 2 largest exchanges that set the price for everybody, and start buying whenever the price wants to drop to ensure your investment stays safe. If the price is rising and traders start selling you buy it all up to keep the price going up. Once the price is on the top and you made 200-300% profit you sell.
This is why the price goes up and down in phases in my opinion. And the cycles will get longer as the average value of Bitcoin gets higher. There is more money to be made, but you need to be able to afford longer cycles.
This dynamic will change after halving, because you can only buy half as much directly from miners, so who knows what will happen...
Also, who knows how much role my hypothesis plays in the overall price. Maybe less than I imagine.

It would be a fallacy if I created a new shitcoin and suggested that I only need 0.1% of the stock money to end up in my shitcoin. But I did no such thing. I was referring to Bitcoin, which is already a successful project, a currency that many serious investors already invested in. It's reasonable to assume that 1/1000 of the investor money would eventually end up in Bitcoin just for the purposes of diversification, even if they don't believe in it for the odd chance that Bitcoin succeeds beyond their expectations. Remember NYSE is experimenting with Bitcoin, so there is some small cred to bitcoin on Wall St. for sure.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:38:18
The majority is bitcoin speculators sitting on USD in exchanges thought this may trigger an increase in price, so they went into Bitcoin.
A minority of Bitcoins are being bought by people who realized that the doomsday scenarios are real, because it just happened to Greece, so it makes sense to diversify and buy a bit of BTC. But that's not just Greeks or Europeans. That's worldwide. The majority of these new users have yet to buy BTC as it takes a couple of days to get approved and move money into exchanges. Only a handful of exchanges allow you to buy bitcoins the same day.
The rally will continue in the next few days.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:50:04
If BTC will drop when all else is green it will be a great sign that BTC is great tool to diversify. The more independent an asset is the more valuable for a stable investment portfolio. This gives a signal to serious investors that it makes sense to invest a bit into BTC to reduce risks.

I understand that independent nodes secure the network, but I don't understand how running many nodes within the same hosting provider helps. The hosting company essentially controls those nodes and they don't give more security than a single node, not?
In other words, I think it's more beneficial to run your own node at home than with a hosting provider, unless that hosting service doesn't have any nodes running yet.

I think that's a straw-man. Typically bitcoiners do not say that it's the mathematically perfect money in the sense that the code doesn't have to change. The bitcoin code has been evolving ever since Satoshi first released it.
What Bitcoiners say is that it can't be manipulated or inflated on will by governments. Bitcoiners always say that one of the beauties of Bitcoin is that it's code, which can be improved continuously.

That's an incredible amount of people. This means we have at least 10M people have bitcoin now overall. That's a medium sized European country.
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:59:33
That's true, but not all investors are so rational and calculate long time ahead. Most people think and act short term, especially those who are not real investors just buy into bitcoin for fun or as a hedge against other risks. So, significant amount of people will buy shortly before halving as the news hit media in anticipation of a value increase creating a "self fulfilling prophecy". As people see value going up, they will see it as a confirmation of the theory and thus jump on the bandwagon as well.
Hopefully this increased demand will be met with sell orders so the price doesn't go off the roof, but only increases 2x at most. I understand a bubble is tempting, but it's not healthy for bitcoin. For a steady store of value we need a stable currency that slowly and steadily creeps up in value without huge (8x+, 80%-) sudden jumps up and down.

It won't be obsolete. In my opinion only a handful of governments will be able to afford to run secure cryptos. Canada, Australia, US, UK, France, China, India, etc. but many small nations will have the choice to either adopt another nation's crypto currency which is problematic from legal and perception point of view, or adopt an international one like Bitcoin.

It’s a theoretical 600K. If you actually had to buy this much hash power you would not be able to buy it because you would be driving the price of mining equipment up. You may end up spending 10x as much if it’s even possible. 
However the same isn’t true for alts. There is more mining equipment available so you could probably get away with just a doubling of the listed prices. 
This is why Bitcoin is so much more secure than alts.

* You don't pay a yearly fee on a bitcoin account. You usually pay anywhere between $30 to $70 on a VISA card.
* You will pay less by using bitcoins because merchants will routinely pass on the savings from not having to pay the hefty credit card fees and not having to cover the frequent credit card frauds.
* No limit on transaction size with Bitcoin. You can buy a house or a boat with bitcoins, you can't really do that with VISA. Few people have a VISA limit that covers a decent new car.
* You can pay to your friend or anybody who accepts bitcoins even a beggar with a QR code. With VISA you're pretty much limited to merchants and nowadays people who have Square readers.
* If you lose your phone or other device that contains your password protected bitcoin wallet you don't lose your bitcoins. You can simply continue spending your bitcoins from a cloud backup. If your VISA is lost of stolen you would have to get a replacement card made which may be cumbersome and usually takes at least several day or a week. Could be annoying if traveling.
* You can accept payments too and you don't have to pay hefty fees.
* You can pay very small amounts with bitcoins, unlike with VISA where usually you can't buy anything for less than a dollar or sometimes 5 or 10 dollars depending on the merchant. You can't usually buy a lollipop with a VISA.
Do add if anything else comes to mind folks!

@_date: 2014-04-15 04:55:14
Is it lower or higher?
How much do you pay per month for your account, $10-15? How much does your employer pays to send your salary, $20-30? How much do you pay in fees when you use ATMs or credit cards, 1-5%? It adds up.
It can be much higher if you have more than one account and you pay for your credit cards.

If having practically no inflation in 20+ years will threaten Bitcoin's network people will support a small reasonable constant inflation rate. A 0.1% a year won't threaten your savings, but it will ensure it keeps value by feeding the network with new coins.
But we will probably not need to do such a thing. If we have 500x more transactions than Today which is perfectly reasonable in 10+ years the fees will make more BTC than mining does Today.
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:51:06
Could be more or less. Any action changes the bids. Also, bringing the price to $390 for a second means little. It can immediately drop back if not sustained. Flash spike.

He may just wanted to calm down investors who are worried about Bitcoin killing PayPal's business model. He's simply saying if Bitcoin becomes a problem we just integrate it and take advantage of it.
Still, this also means they think that putting down Bitcoin would scare more investors away than suggesting that they are open to it. This is not dramatic but still a positive development for Bitcoin.

Satoshi is probably and unfortunately dead and nobody has access to those coins mined really early. But if he's alive he's totally entitled to that wealth. Elon Musk sold PayPal for billions. Nobody said PayPal is dead because the founder got rich from it.
51% is a theoretical threat. Everything has theoretical threats. Name one technology that doesn't.
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it's code that can be changed if we want to. It's at v.0.9 and most of the code changed since it was originally started. It has improved and several potential and real problems were fixed. It's still in beta and work in progress.
Bitcoin is doing great as long as there are people willing to work on the core code and the surrounding ecosystem bit by bit.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:23:06
I understand your argument and I agree with it. Let me try to give a reason.
I think Bitcoin is like a meme. It spreads because it's an interesting story from many different angles. It's hi-tech (always shared), it's a cool story (anonymous creator, end of banks), it's about money and power (I can be rich), etc. And it has real utility that solves real problems, so once the meme spreads adoption spreads too. So far the adoption was severely limited because the tech was too hard for most people, especially security. But this will change as new bitcoin related sites and products come out thanks to all the investments in bitcoin startups. Thus the next 12 month will open up bitcoin to millions of new users.
Does this make sense?
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:44:34
Haha, good point. :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:45:52
I think there are too many assumptions to be able to make any price predictions.
On one hand Bitcoin may not be the only game in town in a few years. Even current fiat currencies could turn into cryptos removing some of the advantages Bitcoin currently holds over them.
On the other hand Bitcoin may become a vehicle to transfer money not just to store wealth like an asset. That alone could make one bitcoin worth a million $.
The range is so large and there are so many variables.
I wrote a similar article Gold vs Bitcoin: 
I argued that both are good and should be included in a healthy portfolio for different reasons.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:40:36
I did give support. Maybe it's insufficient or incorrect, but saying that I didn't give any is simply not true.
The price growth is not correlated with number of users or wallets on the short term only on the long term.
The market is so small you can move the market price up 50% with just a few million well placed dollars. You don't need millions of people for that. Perhaps not even thousands.

It's because of several new merchants accepting Bitcoin and people are trying them out. Especially buying new cool computers from Alienware with a $150 bitcoin discount. This happens every time after a new bigger merchant comes on board. The price will bounce back when the initial excitement dies down. On the long term Bitcoin gets stronger and more valuable the more people use it, so it's a good time to buy when we have these dips.

The community always says dogecoin is not about speculation. So, they don't and shouldn't care about the price. They just play with it and tip each other. It's a social experiment that is interesting to watch. It's different from bitcoin in many ways.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:52:20
This is a very dangerous strategy. The lower the price is the higher the chance it will start going back up. You will almost certainly lose this way on the long term.
If you want to play the market you should sell when it's high and then hope it drops at least a little and then buy back and wait for it to go high again.
Either read a book on trading or just buy and stay put for a couple of years. Otherwise more experienced traders will be glad to take your money bit by bit. :)

@_date: 2014-04-15 05:13:56
I think that's simply not true. The fees are either indeed there unless you qualify for 0$ account, but that will require you to keep a certain amount of money on the account at all times in which case you're paying a hidden fee by allowing the bank to lend out your funds to other customers.
Wire fees are not zero. And that is money you don't get because it's a cost your employer has to give to the bank instead of you.
ATM fees are high unless you use certain limited ATMs. If you're abroad or you have to use a different bank's ATM there are fees.
Credit cards all charge 2+%. Debit cards can be less. At these are costs passed on to you by the merchants.
It's a marketing tactic to hide the fees. But they are there are you're paying for it indirectly or directly I'm afraid.

OK. So it will all come down to:
1. I can use my Credit Card to continue collecting points and 1-4% money back and have the added insurance of the credit card company. It will also cost the merchant appr. 5%.
2. I can use my Bitcoins hopefully getting a 5-10% discount, but I won't have any insurance.
These two basically comparable payment options. And, that is great news. Bitcoin doesn't have to capture 100% market share to win. If it only captures anywhere from 1%+ it's a win.

Question: Why is the Socioeconomic Costs for Bitcoin is negligible? There is lots of fraud going on in Bitcoin's ecosystem unfortunately. Also MtGox and Silk Road. I understand it's just growing pains, but it's not negligible. If you put down $600m for gold, then Mt.Gox's roughly similar amount of theft should be mentioned too even if it's negligible compared to the trillions.
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:43:46
I think it will touch $300 before it starts going up. Once it crosses $1,000 we will never see $500 EVER! Just like we can't buy bitcoin for $5 or $50 either.
But be aware a year ago I predicted $10 and it went to hundreds.
People should invest only as much as they can afford to lose. The rest of the savings can stay in 'safe' sure to lose 3-5% fiat due to inflation. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:57:45
Interesting idea. How do I calculate that? You would need to provide your BTC buying price to be able to calculate that, not?
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:47:33
Indeed. Weak hands with short perspective give up coins to people with a longer perspective, which makes it more protected against a panic crash.

It's easy to check:  $10 for the basic account. ;)
Anyway, for the main argument it is irrelevant if the fees are $200 or $2000 per year. Also, the USA is just one of the many developed countries. And other countries have higher fees than the USA in general.

If you were in their position what would you have done? Stop accepting new miners when you reach 16%? How would that prevent another pool reaching 51%?

So since Bitcoin's code can be upgraded there is a big chance it will survive like email and html did.
But still Friendster was code too, they could've made it better to suit the needs.
I think I found the difference. Mosaic, Napster, Friendster, Mac OS were all owned by an entity who couldn't keep up with demand.
Email, HTML were open to the public to change and improved, just like Bitcoin is.
So yeah, I see a pattern why Bitcoin will survive.

100% pre-mined and the only way you can get XRP if the founders give it to you if you do certain things they want you to do.

I can see where you're coming from.
My approach: if you put in 5% of your savings into BTC and it goes up 10-100x because it enters conservative mainstream you may increase your savings by 150% to 500%. If it goes bust because of some currently unknown bug or reason you only lost 5%. So, it's totally reasonable to take your chances and invest some in BTC.

If you lose $900 would it hurt you? If not, take your chances, keep them and check the price in 2016. If you need it for essential things by all means sell it.
In a few years you will either not be able to buy anything with it or you will be able to buy a car or a house. It will surely not be in the $400's ever again.

I use bitcoin to buy anything from Starbucks, because I get 20% off with coinforcoffee.com.
Here is the problem. I get 4% back with most credit card purchases. But even if bitcoin was accepted everywhere I would probably pay most things with CC to save money unless bitcoin purchases came with at least 2-4% off.
But if bitcoin was accepted at gas stations and grocery stores I would surely use it occasionally just to support the network even if it costs me a few percents extra.

Yes, Apple will incorporate Bitcoin because they don't care as long as they make money. They don't have a stake in making VISA or AMEX succeed. They just want to take a cut. In fact I think there is a chance Bitcoin will be part of Apple's payment system within a year.

Thanks for the comment.
It's not unreasonable that 20M can happen after 12 months because this is very roughly the amount of people who are able to technically understand bitcoin, have internet, are adults, have savings to invest, and most importantly ideologically open to Bitcoin. The real number is probably much higher than 20M, but I wanted to be conservative.
What do you think the number is? Only 10M or 7M? Millions are very small numbers in a global population of 7B with like 2B active internet users.
I think it's a reasonable expectation that 20M people will learn about Bitcoin in the next 12 months if they haven't already and they will become users in some way or another because of repeat exposure especially because Bitcoin will be more fun, easy and useful as time goes by.
I read about a research where they asked scientists in their own fields to predict the future and 90% of them used linear trends to estimate even through they knew the developments are not linear but exponential in nature. People in general, even the smartest just don't feel comfortable with exponential growth. Ray Kurzweil talks about this in great detail in his books.

I don't have any direct info, but some who were close to him think that he's dead unfortunately. He was battling with a fatal illness when he stopped working on Bitcoin. If that's true and that's a big IF he may have given the coins to some loved one. Or he may have thought it's not worth the trouble to teach someone about it because it didn't amount to much at the time. It's possible one day someone finds an envelope with a list of private keys on a flee market worth a trillion dollars. Good plot for a movie.

I made some calculations and if hypothetically the whole world would be using bitcoin we would have a huge net gain in energy usage.
Also, in the future when Bitcoin's value has increased significantly and the price stabilized there is a theoretical possibility to alter the code to use proof of stake instead of proof of work, so we would not need so much electricity.
Also, once we have new generation nuclear plants like thorium, energy will be less of a problem.

First of all, bitcoin will likely never be the only crypto or currency in the world. So you will still have inflationary currencies. Bitcoin will only bring in a bit or lot of sanity into the picture.
But in a hypothetical world let's assume only Bitcoin exists and no other currency. Bitcoin IS inflationary, mining inflates it. And this will be the case for several years to come.
But let's assume that we arrive to the point where all Bitcoins have been mined and there are no other currencies. That's going to be long way into the future where money may lose its utility altogether as it will be a post humanist society where robots produce everything for us and the cost of stuff is measured in life minutes or some other currently unknown unit rather than money.
Let's assume we didn't arrive to singularity and Bitcoin is the only fully mined currency and it does cause real economic problems. No worries. We can fork the code and allow more Bitcoins to be mined.
I think this is a no issue.

Max Kaiser said he lost a huge amount of BTC too. I lost a few LTC myself. Most people I know who played with crypto lost at least some.

MPesa has a backing of a multinational corporation (Vodafone), no danger of loss of funds and good apps for transactions.
Bitcoin lacks the backing and the insurance against loss, but it has apps, has global reach and is decentralized, so there is no one company that has the ability to shut down the entire service on a whim.

Be careful with these alts. Don't lose your money! Many coins climbed up fast just to collapse a few weeks later. If you speculate: buy low.

Probably not lost. ANXPRO won't or shouldn't send it to an incorrect address.
Several of the characters inside a Bitcoin address are used as a checksum so that typographical errors can be automatically found and rejected. The checksum also allows Bitcoin software to confirm that a 33-character (or shorter) address is in fact valid and isn't simply an address with a missing character.

There has been a period of stability before each price bubble. 
All the weak hands sold, all the speculators bought. There is no reason to go up or down.

Maybe the numbers are wrong, but his general idea is correct. Right now Bitcoin is extremely small and the market is very thin for big players. They can buy a bunch of BTC, but they can't really use it right now to transfer or trade hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. Just a million dollar would move the market significantly up or down. That's not really acceptable for them.
But the bigger picture is that there is no reason why the value and market cap of bitcoin can't grow further exponentially. Today we move millions of $ a day. In two years we could be moving tens of millions of $, which is still too small for these big players.
But what happens in 5 years?
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:50:58
Some interesting points.
I think the article downplays the security of traditional monetary systems. The operating cost of VISA is just the tip of the ice-berg in terms of cost. There are also banks in the background issuing and backing those cards and there is a large police force and judicial system securing these institutions. (Without the threat of jail time criminals would just break in and take the money.)

Yes, unless you want a new algo or want mining as Colored Coins provide neither.

@_date: 2014-07-31 16:44:12
Of course all this will only happen if there won't be competition to bitcoin. And there may be and here is why:
• The US government could announce they are transitioning into crypto, for example the USD can be exchanged to crypto USD (ran by the US government). This would instantly change the balance of power in crypto as the USD is the strongest currency and paired with the power of crypto it would ensure it's dominance.
• Somebody could come up with a significantly better version  of Bitcoin, that fixes all potential issues of bitcoin and is faster, safer, easier to use and offers some feature that makes it a must have. For example imagine a crypto solution that could be safely printed on a piece of paper besides on the internet. People could just print their own notes and use them to pay at a farmer's market. It would take a year or more till everybody switches over, but this could make Bitcoin irrelevant eventually.
Both of these will eventually happen, but it could take 10-20 years. Until then Bitcoin is here to rule in my opinion.

Bitcoin isn't a fan club like Doge. It's a protocol like TCP/IP for example.
I think sponsoring stuff for Bitcoin wouldn't be really appropriate, unless it's like donation to Wikipedia, because it would seem commercial and pushy. People should adopt Bitcoin because of its intrinsic value, not made up extrinsic image to borrow terms from marketing.

The advantage of a machine can be that it is able to keep lots of detailed data in its "head" all at the same time to make a calculation.
I think humans can't rationally do that. Our subconscious does all the calculation of lots of data and then gives us a 'feeling' as an output. The problem is our feelings are distorted by various 'brain bugs'. Poor long term decisions. Loss aversion. Etc.

@_date: 2014-06-30 18:52:03
It can go both ways. But I think the fact that there is a strong demand for this many coins from so many players is a good sign regardless of the price.
I hope it was bought by an organization who is building a service around bitcoin because they will be seriously incentivized to make their service work and thus increase the value of their holdings. If it's just an investor who holds them, I'm not that happy.
It's good news either ways. This many Bitcoins in any government's hands was not ideal.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:24:29
It is dropping because of the good news. People buy the discounted computers with bitcoins to support the new merchants. Alienware and others are selling the bitcoins to recover the USD value. On the short term this pushes the price down.
It's a good time to buy because larger merchant acceptance only increases the value of bitcoins.

This is where I got the numbers from: 
To waive the fee you either need to maintain a minimum balance and/or send money to your account. These are non-interest account therefore by keeping money there you're losing the potential interest that would paid on your money if you didn't have to keep that balance on your account therefore you are paying the hidden fee.

My only bitcoin related associations are: Inside Bitcoins international trade show was my idea 2 years ago and that I run bitcoinowl.com.
I didn't claim this prediction is scientific or based on anything else but past trends and their extrapolation. Also, my feelings are based on meeting people who are building the bitcoin's ecosystem: startups, investors, etc.

I believe merchant adoption will actually drive prices down. The more merchants the more sales, the more sales the more sale of bitcoins on markets without delay. This puts a pressure on prices downward.
But if we have sites, hardware, services that provide better security for example and most importantly Bitcoin related services that build on top of Bitcoin it will drive interest in Bitcoin. There are lots of startups working on stuff, they are well funded and they are coming out with things within months.
Also, institutional investors will come in if there are exchanges to serve them. They are coming too. This will drive the price up too.

We could backup to anything that can connect through the USB port.
I think they don't have to come in pairs, but could be cheaper if both are ordered. I imagine most people will only order the hot wallet.

Confirmation bias, also called myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.
Do we suffer from it? Far from it. We warn people not to invest more than they can afford to lose. We vote up bad news and problems. We call upon the BS of pumpers.
Are we happy for any success? Are we bullish about the long term success of Bitcoin. Yes. But that doesn't mean we're biased.
It's the careful consideration and deep knowledge of this new technology and its implications is what makes us bullish, not wishful thinking.

Thanks for the kind words. I agree in principal.
But as Ray Kurzweil and George Friedman said. Ironically the longer the time scale the easier the prediction.

Then, when you go into decades into the future it becomes fuzzy again.

"Gold is a finite, rare resource, whose supply is not likely to increase unpredictably."
Not true. Technology can change this assumption. We can already produce gold in nuclear facilities from other metals.
And recently it was discovered that certain bacteria can synthesize gold as a waste product.
And there could be several other ways we could create physical gold in the future.
It's reasonable to assume that in the future rearranging subatomic particles to create any atom we want is going to be a reality. Thus gold will lose all of its scarcity. It's not going to happen overnight, but it already has started.

You're right about the smart phone, but I'm thinking to make a dedicated device for people who are either scared to use an always on device for their funds or don't have a smart phone, yet want to use crypto. If we can make it cheap enough it can target people who can't afford a smart phone.

I disagree. I think it will 'fail' if it doesn't grow at least 10-100x bigger. You need liquidity to be able to transfer serious sums of money in international trade.

Note: Bitcoin is inflating at about 10% for the next 3 years and then 5% for the 4 years after. Then it's gradually going to almost zero.
So Bitcoin for the next 7 years is more inflationary than the US$ or other government currencies.
The difference is that it's likely that Bitcoin's adoption rate will be higher than 10% and 5% in the next few years, so the price will have to rise despite the inflation to accommodate for new users.

If you were to buy $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin on Bitstamp in one go it would move the price up about $15 only for a short while.
$10,000,000 would be difficult to buy however. It would bump the price all the way to $750 or higher. One would have to do it slowly and on at least 5-6 exchanges.

1 block per minute would be great. I know it's somewhat easier to attack it, but Bitcoin can take this slightly increased risk. On the upside we would be able to handle many more transactions and Bitcoin would be 10x faster in every day use. Fast transaction times is the only thing I really like about alts.
Also, think about the image such a change would communicate to the general public. Bitcoin has been upgraded to be 10x faster and now can handle 200x more transactions (with 20MB blocks). I can see headlines: "Bitcoin is growing up for mass adoption."
Remember the fundamentals of the tech are there, we just need to improve the image of Bitcoin, so more people start trusting it. Showing that Bitcoin is able to evolve is very important.

This is great news for Bitcoin.
Presumably they will be running several nodes and will be buying up bitcoins (although not much) to carry the colored coins information if the test is successful.
They are smart to use the Bitcoin blockchain as it's the biggest and most secure of all by far. Building their own blockchain would be risky form a security perspective.
Most importantly if this goes mainstream, it will mean a very important mainstream financial system will rely on the Blockchain, so it will give confidence to Bitcoin investors that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere soon, which will make Bitcoin more secure as a store of value and presumably it will grow in value as more investors use Bitcoin for this purpose.

Consider that it's estimated about 40% of all mined coins are lost (especially early blocks), so they own almost 2% of all spendable bitcoins. On the other hand by the time we are done mining the amount will be less than 1% assuming people won't lose that many of the new coins in the future.

I think not. eBay is PayPal. If eBay wanted to accept bitcoin they can included it in the PayPal wallet and do it themselves and take all the profits. They don't need bitpay.
What I can imagine however is that bitpay will be bought up by PayPal within a few months. That would make total sense for PayPal and eBay. They could scoop up BitPay for a few hundred million dollars and instantly ensure their future in payments.

But if true it also promises that exchanges or whoever is moving the price now will attempt a pump again, perhaps moving the price well beyond $1,000 regardless of how much real USD is flowing into bitcoin. So for a speculator this news gives more confidence that a bubble is just a matter of time.
But I think manipulation like the one described in the article is happening all the time on all markets. And it is working both ways. It's not an extraordinary event that would drive the price.
There were lots of people buying bitcoins with real money at the time. Lots.

A new altcoin by citi for example won't be easily adopted by competing banks. A new altcoin by a country won't be easily adopted by other countries. Dozens of new decentralized altcoins exist and they haven't managed to seriously challange Bitcoin so far. Only Litecoin (and maybe Doge) has some recognition, but together they don't make up 5% of Bitcoin and they move roughly together with BTC.
Bitcoin is independent from any interests essentially, has the first mover advantage and the most robust mining infrastructure therefore it has the highest chance of being adopted worldwide.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:23:18
What's happening is exactly what should happen when a serious change is to be introduced. If it was happening any faster it would be a reason for concern. With code that controls money you have to be more conservative and we have to explore all possible avenues of what could go wrong over and over. We should not be as aggressive with development as with other open source software projects.
Alts are great, but there is almost nothing that Bitcoin can't adopt on a 1000x bigger scale if something looks really good and deemed useful.
The large scale of adoption is the most important feature of Bitcoin that other alts with better features can't really achieve in any reasonable time frame. Most people won't hold an alt even for a short amount of time, because they are more volatile and almost nobody accepts them.

They could try to inflate the price, but as soon as the price would hit 1K or 2K lots of speculators would start selling to realize profit. They would have to buy lots of expensive coins to push the price artificially to 3-5K.
At the top they won't be able to cash out. There would be a limited amount of USD ready to buy bitcoins at those prices. As soon as they start selling thousands of bitcoins the price would instantly collapse.
The only way they will benefit from their investments is if they let the price go up organically in correlation with the value it brings to more and more people.
What they probably do is protect their investments by allocating funds to buy coins if the price falls below a certain threshold to make sure it doesn't go to zero and thus make their investments worthless. It makes sense to spend a few hundred thousand dollars to protect tens of millions.

Problem is, the judge must have an immunity to have compassion with the people he convicts. There is no other way to do that job.
If what Ross is saying is true and he created the site for the good, the minute he saw drugs being exchanged on Silk Road he should've shut the site down. Even as a naive individual he should've known all too well that this is against the law and will eventually be prosecuted.
I know it's easy to be smart retrospectively, but still... I don't know what was he thinking.
Finally, I agree with the general sentiment that people should be allowed to trade anything they want as long as they don't hurt others. Alcohol is illegal in many parts of the world, just like heroine in the USA and the reasoning is the same: it makes people dangerous. Yet, billions of beer cans and wine bottles sold every year legally. Makes you wonder what's the logic.

It's really nice to see that core devs are losing sleep over a hard fork. I'm really grateful for all this care.
And it's also nice to see others care for Gavin's wellbeing.
Overall, these events in the last few weeks give me great confidence in the power of our Bitcoin community. Any important change should always involve strong emotions, long discussions and exploration. This is how it should be done.
And, don't worry about the process being slow. It has to be slow, so everyone can think through the possibilities in every way. This is how we reduce risk and maximize value. Money software should be built in a much more conservative way than other open source projects.
If there was total consensus and we would rush the decisions and implementation, or we would be in a complete stale-mate or lack of care, that would give me a reason for concern. What's happening instead is good and exciting.
Keep challenging each other folks. Thanks for your work!

Ridiculous? It makes total sense to me. I think the confusion comes from thinking of mining as a tool to generate funds for profit. Here the devices are mining, but the mining will be tiny amounts and the value doesn't come from the Satoshis mined and then sold, it comes from the services those Satoshis enable on these devices.
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:23:45
Together with the location and other data generated by the phone it can work. Mining alone not so much. 21 is not about mining for profit. The value comes from other features that the devices will have because of the Satoshis on the device.

@_date: 2015-05-31 18:30:43
You underestimate the power of the network effect. Bitcoin is better than government fiat, but because of the network effect Bitcoin can't displace it. Within the crypto community Bitcoin has the same overwhelming power of the network effect. No alt will overshadow Bitcoin in the next few years even if they had much better features. Beyond that Bitcoin may become so strong that no altcoin will ever be able to take it over, or it's possible some other altcoin will close-in on it, so there will be 1-2 strong competitors besides Bitcoin.
For what Bitcoin is used Today, which is a store of value and trading it works great. There is no real benefit alts offer in these two major use-cases. For an alt to take over Bitcoin first we would need a massive new use case where the alt can shine next to Bitcoin. For example if the programmable nature of cryptos becomes a number one use case, ethereum or other smart cryptos could become important. But even in this case Bitcoin could be hard forked over time and match the alt's features or even improve on them.
The way I see alts now is they are the betas, and Bitcoin is the real deal where the best, well tested features of alts are implemented for real world use.
If I was an investor I would invest in alts on the short term, and Bitcoin on the long term.

@_date: 2016-03-16 05:05:22
Time is never the limiting factor, so we can disregard time. Fees are. Theoretically, if the fees are lower on 2MB because there is congestion on 1MB, the UTXO attack could be cheaper at 2MB, but then in this case you have a much bigger problem on the 1MB than the UTXO attack.
I didn't ignore externalities, that would be a different argument. I was mentioning about an option miners have against a potential spam signature attack, or relatively slower upload times.
So all in all, I don't think you managed to demonstrate that there is a higher risk of attacks at 2MB compared to 1MB. Only the UTXO attack you mentioned is slightly higher risk at 2MB, but the spam attack is significantly lower. They don't even balance each other out. 2MB is still the better option in this regard.
1MB vs 2MB is not really a technical question, but a philosophical one, because the technical questions are solvable. Do we want lots of people (including poorer) doing lots of transactions on the network and thus making the network exponentially more valuable, reliable, durable, relevant in the world economy, or do we want fewer (richer) folks playing around with Bitcoin on current transaction levels? I would go for changing the world and eventually 100MB+ blocks running on specialized professional node servers and less home nodes, but I understand if others want to keep it as 'play money' or 'digital gold' for the privileged at maximum decentralization.
The high throughput crypto will be realized no matter what Bitcoin does, because there is a need for it. The question is will Bitcoin retain its property of store of value if most of the world is using another crypto currency that is faster, cheaper, safer and more accepted? It still could, but the chances are lower compared to the situation where Bitcoin is the one everyone uses, like now.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:36:38
It's ease of use. You could send bitcoins to your device, but it's easier if it's generated by the device directly, so you don't have to worry about it. You just plug it in and it starts generating it's own token for authentication. It's plug-and-play.
You only need a few Satoshis to get the system going, so you don't need much mining power at all.

It doesn't matter. This is not about making money with bitcoin mining. It's about getting enough Satoshis that enable the new features on these devices. The new functionality is what brings the value, not the absolute value of the Satoshis mined.
@_date: 2015-05-19 01:49:27
Sending a few Satoshis to your device is easy for you and me. But for 99.9% of the people it's very hard. They will either have to ask a friend or a service to do it for them or they will just give up.
Virtually nobody who doesn't currently use Bitcoin will go through the trouble of finding out how they can get bitcoins, then finding a service they can trust, then registering with them including sending private documents, then sending money to them to buy the bitcoins, and finally sending a few satoshi to their device.
With 21 you just buy the device and within a few hours you've Satoshis to spend.
You only need 10MH/s to generate 10-20 Satoshis every day. That's what typical smart phone can do Today more or less. You could mine only when plugged in for charging to generate enough bitcoins to give a typical user all the services Bitcoin can offer.

It's a good article, but I think it's incorrect to say that 21M is the cap and there will never be more of it.
While in practice this is true, in theory it's technically possible to change the code and increase the cap if all users and miners agreed to this change. This is of course quite unlikely to happen, at least not in the foreseeable future. But, I can imagine a few scenarios where the whole Bitcoin community would unanimously agree to increase the cap. But that reason would be unanimously beneficial to the network, so it's not posing a danger of inflation, it's only a possibility in case it's needed for survival.
Btw, such increase of cap was introduced to other cryptocurrencies like Doge, and they suffered greatly in consequence.
One could argue of course that the new code will not be Bitcoin anymore, as Bitcoin's main attribute is it's cap of 21M. It's really a philosophical debate.

There are real users behind AWS nodes. Somebody has to foot the bill. Granted 100 nodes with one user behind them  IS a waste from a security perspective. 
But regardless they are not a waste of resources. They serve lots of data reliably and fast which helps home nodes too. 
There is a huge million or even billion dollar incentive for hosting companies not to meddle with their user's data.
The more variety in node setups, the harder it is to orchestrate an attack.
If hypothetically a world government would want to kill bitcoin nodes, they would have to force both ISPs and hosting providers to cooperate. This is twice as hard, than just forcing ISPs. Thus hosted nodes do add to the robustness of the network, even if they are less valuable than home nodes. 
Also, there are many times more hosting companies out there in the world than ISPs. So if hypothetically if we count each hosting provider and ISP as one regardless how many users are attached to them, hosting nodes would be very relevant for decentralization.

You're right. Starting up is hard, but scaling after initial success is always harder for any new project. I've been through several projects and scaling is when all the personal attacks and bs happens. It's expected and normal unfortunately. We humans operate this way at this stage of our development. But it's all good at the end.
The cool thing is as opposed to a startup company where you only have one team of founders, here we have several team members within multiple teams, so the chance of success if very high. It just takes time, effort and some tears.

What do you think they did wrong with Doge? (Sorry if it's off topic)
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:06:26
Every currency is only as valuable as people are willing to pay for it. The reason people are willing to give money for it is because it's easier to handle the wealth than carrying cows, bricks or gold. And bitcoins are even easier to handle than normal currency, so their value is even higher. Bitcoins do have value, it's just a virtual value and it comes from the utility that manifest itself in efficiencies anywhere they are used.
It's not as easy to understand as holding a piece of apple and understanding it has value because you can eat it, but it doesn't mean it doesn't have value.
The more the world will move to the internet economy, the more digital currencies will be useful and be more valuable in general.

"Prime Controllers are essentially hyper staking wallets that generate 100% interest on the coins deposited into them. Only a few dozen Prime Controllers exist and they are held by several elite groups in the remains of the Paycoin community."

Good question!
I couldn't find out how unreliable they are, but let's say 1:20 of cards fail within 5 years. If you backup to 4 cards that will give you a chance of 1:3.2M chance of all 4 being corrupt including the one in the wallet. And you could back-up to a new one every month perhaps to further decrease the chances and replace aging.
You would have to keep them in a faraday cage and in different locations.

So how would I incorporate Braintree on my site (logodesignforbitcoin-dot-com)? Is there an easy solution for Drupal?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:05:24
1. Bitcoin being open source makes it stronger, because thousands of people watch over the code and help if needed. You can run a clone, but you don't have the network effect. You can run your own internet in your home, but without any visitors using your network you won't have much fun with it.
2. The high cost of mining makes it secure too. Breaking bitcoin is very expensive and thus economically virtually nobody has an incentive to break it.
3. The 10 transaction per second is temporary and serves the community well for now. Remember this is code that can be improved and Gavin is actually working on raising the transaction per second limit to 20x soon and then it will increase exponentially onwards.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:33:44
Site runs on Drupal. There are modules for Bitcoin, but seem to be complicated to implement and I don't want to store bitcoins on the server or use a third party like BitPay if not necessary. What do you recommend?
Currently I just posted the BTC public address for payments and clients need to fill their sending address on orders so I can verify the payment has been sent for a specific job. But obviously this is not an ideal solution.

You're right about how the sentiments change, but the protocol is important no matter if the price is rising or dropping.
Btw, rising prices are good news for the protocol too. We want the people in bitcoin to be rich so they can support building the infrastructure.

In theory Bitcoin works at any value. But price still matters because it generates interest from the public (it's the most expensive currency in the world), and incentive for miners so they secure the blockchain, which in turn makes the network more valuable.

Of course, home ISP is better, I'm just pointing out that a home node is not truly independent, it relies on centralized services also. Having a mix of all kinds of nodes is best, correct?
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:43:25
AWS nodes help the network even if they are single point of failure, and the other half are not AWS, which helps decentralization. It's all positive.

Another theory: Folks are DDOS'd it so people can't send their bitcoins to the exchange and sell while the price rises.
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:13:56
If you consider nodes being on single cloud service (AWS) to be worthless for decentralization, consider these things:
1. Do you consider all home nodes running on an ISP (ex. Comcast) to be unique? By the same logic applied to AWS one could argue that ISP home nodes are also worthless for decentralization because the ISP could shut them all down at once if it wanted to. All the thousands of nodes would be reduced to a few dozen in practice by this thinking. In my opinion, several nodes on a single ISP or cloud service is more than just one node on the same network.
2. All those who pay for the Classic cloud hosting could easily pay for other services, it's the personal intention and available capital to set-up a certain number of nodes that counts to provide decentralization. If Amazon were to stop all Bitcoin nodes, all these people could set up nodes on other services within days providing the same level of decentralization to the network. We would probably see more nodes than ever if AWS was shut down on us in protest.
3. It's kinda hard to run a node at home if people are being DDOS-ed constantly by certain entities interested to oppose Classic nodes. Perhaps stop the DDOS and then Classic supporters can run home nodes as suggested.

Are we seeing UTXO spam that is only limited by the 1MB? We are not. The UTXO spammers aren't limited by time, but the fees they have to pay.
If nobody verifies 'spam signatures' it's not a cost to anyone. If somebody does verify it, he doesn't consider it spam or a waste of resources.

That could be done to give the user some funds to start with, and the mining chip would keep the balance up for years.
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:21:26
Yes. If we started to see that fees don't support mining, and we would see the security of bitcoin and the value of the coins collapsing in result. If at the same time coins with unlimited coin release would be going up in value, I can see overwhelming miner and community support to hard fork to supply a steady number of bitcoins forever through mining. But I don't think this will happen.

Maybe they are sending it to themselves today to stress the network, but tomorrow, but the same amount of transactions and much more would be sent legitimately between people (and automated systems). If there is a congestion now with such a mild stress test, we have a major problem.
And, LN won't help here as LN will add a bunch more transactions to the mempool to open and close channels. Besides LN isn't going to be the only second layer service wanting to use Bitcoin's blockchain. We will have dozens more in the coming years. Bitcoin needs to be able to accommodate them too, and LN won't help in those situations.
The only solution here is to gradually and consistently raise the blocksize and hack the code to make the individual transactions smaller and blocks propagate faster (which being done). This will reduce decentralization a bit, because I won't be able to run a node in 2020, but on the other hand we will have thousands of large data servers ran by various big corporations who are currently not running nodes, because they have no use case for Bitcoin at these capacities. These data warehouses will support the tens of millions of on-chain transactions per day that facilitate billions of off-chain transactions. And we're not just talking about money here, but everything else, like land titles and contracts, etc.
This can be all be done on Bitcoin and will be done in one way or another.
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:56:08
Blocks like this aren't helpful:
Somebody mining for just the reward and not including any transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:12:52
Highly hypothetical, but let's say we discover a new currently not known use for bitcoin that can solve a future issue, but for it to work we must be able to burn bitcoins to a range of addresses dedicated for this purpose. These addresses are not spendable, and automatically introduced as mining reward. Technically we would be raising the cap, but in practice the bitcoins in circulation would remain the same. The new burning use case would open up something that gives immense value to the network, thus all participants agree to it.

@_date: 2016-03-16 01:46:00
Of course it is. With 1MB you only need to fill the remaining space to 1M with spam to create congestion. With 2MB you have to do that plus another 1MB.
For example if the 1MB blocks are at 90%, the attacker only need to fill 10%. With 2MB, they would have to fill 110%, making the attack 11x more expensive. Instead of burning $40K, they would have to burn $440K in fees.

An ad hominem is an argument or reaction directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.
Saying Roger is a liar, therefore you must not trust his position on scaling issues is a perfect example of an ad hominem attack. The post is trying to destroy the character of the source, instead of taking on the arguments presented by the source, which is fallacious argumentation.
It doesn't matter if he's a liar or not (not that we actually know if he lied, or he was misled, or was misjudging the situation), what matters are his arguments. If the devil himself came up with an amazing scaling solution, and it was rationally good, we could take/should take the advice no matter the source of the idea.
Talk about reasons why his position on a matter is incorrect, and then it's not an ad hominem. That would be informative, non-confrontational, rational and helpful.
Hope the comment is helpful to understand what ad hominem means and why it's an argumentative fallacy.

It would be great if we could create sidechains out of existing altcoins. 
For example on the Litecoin network you could store Bitcoins in form of Colored Litecoins. Let's call these tokens BTC Lite.
BTC Lite coins would be represented as tokens secured by the Litecoin network, would worth very little LTC, but a high value in BTC.
The reason you would want to convert from BTC to BTC Lite is because the confirmation times are shorter and the fees are lower. However, you would have to take the risk of a less secure network, so you would probably only do this for smaller amounts.
You would convert BTC to BTC Lite by sending a BTC transaction that locks the BTC and unlocks BTC Lite.
You would send and receive BTC Lite as you like and then whenever you want you can go back to BTC, which would lock all the BTC Lite you had and unlocks equivalent BTC.
This can easily done through a centralized system, and also in a decentralized manner by using smart contracts. It's not easy but technically doable in my opinion.
This way you could keep using one currency Bitcoin, but you would be able to use less secure networks for small and frequent transactions. Wallets could manage BTC and BTC Lite within one HD account. It would be like a checking and a savings account in your bank. You only touch your savings (BTC) when making large transactions.
Exchanges for example would allow you to withdraw your Bitcoins in either BTC for a higher fee or BTC Lite for a lower fee. Same goes for deposits, you could send either, and it would show up as Bitcoin, no matter the source.

I think this is a good idea, and do the 2MB bump at the same time, so we have a better chance of hard fork uptake by miners and the whole ecosystem demanding it.

If someone wanted to mine 'bitcoins' that the majority doesn't accept on a fork they can do that right now. All they have to do is start mining on a modified Bitcoin code and they would be making 25BTC every 10 minutes and confirm one single transaction, their own mining. But it makes no sense, because nobody accepts it.

LN needs a larger block too or you won't be able to open close channels.
And LN isn't the only second layer solution. There will be many others also relying on higher on-chain capacity.

It's true that the likelyhood is reduced, but it's far from certainty that it won't be banned. If any government wants to ban Bitcoin they can relatively easily construct a rhetoric that supports a ban even if it's unfair or untrue. Forget bitcoin. Countries have started wars based on false flags.

They test various ideas which Bitcoin can adopt or dismiss based on a given alt's success. Alts are very useful in this regard.
They are likely not good for long time investment given the low chance that the one you hold out of hundreds will take over Bitcoin, but they can be used for short term gains if you time buying and selling right. Most experimental traders buy back into Bitcoin after done playing with an alt. I've seen many posts here on reddit.
Alts have low liquidity, so you can't really trade with too much money, so it's not good for medium or big investors as they can't make enough profit to make their time worth it. Also, a million dollar buy in or sell would not move the needle of Bitcoin, but it would certainly move any other alt significantly, which is bad for trading.

UTXO is equally present at 1MB and 2MB, why does the chance or risk increase at 2MB? You only need to do it over 2 blocks to achieve the same as on 1 block for 2MB. The cost of the permanent attack is the same.
The spam signatures attack can be solved by limiting the single transactions size to be smaller, while the block can be big. Again, same cost of attack at any block size.
Most importantly, miners can simply set the blocksize to 1MB if it suits them better  for any real or imagined reason, and remove all these potential problems. It's not like the storage or download bandwidth is an issue.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

You're right. I feel the same way. He admits he may be wrong, but he feels that if Bitcoin gets big enough to threaten the big money, it will be destroyed. Currently it's tiny, so nobody cares. If it grew 10x bigger they would start to care. If it was 100x bigger they would try to ban it. However it's possible at that size and it being international, it can't be banned anymore. The internet is bad for big money, as it took away the monopoly of spreading information through mass media, but it can't be stopped in free societies.

Yes, 11 years of Bitcoin would not be enough, but the prediction isn't based on Bitcoin's history alone.
He's speculating within the context of a wider geopolitical landscape. He's looking into the future, and asking the question: Is it likely that the governments of the world will act in a way that will force (not just encourage) people to exit into something like Bitcoin, or will they change their ways and thus Bitcoin will have no use case? 
This is a centuries long story that will play out in a certain highly predictable way no matter what any single player in this market does. We don't know when exactly things will happen, and who exactly will trigger certain events, but we have a pretty good idea about what will happen and why. The when and who isn't really important anyway, even though history typically tends to focus on those pieces of information retrospectively giving it unfair attention.

Why not? He can ask anything he wants and miners can comply or not. There is no harm increasing to 1MB.

He has the right idea.
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:48:42
He is right with everything he said. However the solution will be disputed. Core says increasing the blocksize is not the right solution. In their opinion the right solution is the Lighting Network which will increase the the transactional capacity much faster and adds additional features like instantaneus confirmation and lower fees.
I buy the LN strategy and support it, but I think the blocksize should be increased because of LN and the many other second layer projects that are built on top of Bitcoin. 
To open and close channels on the LN, to create smart contracts on Rootstock, to create and trade assets with Colored Coins, etc. we need much more on-chain transactional capability. Even if we only wanted Bitcoin to be money and nothing else with LN, the current capacity of Bitcoin on chain is not enough to serve the world's needs because most people and businesses would want to have at least a few channels open and settle every few weeks or months. It's a bunchs of on-chain transactions even if you buy the Starbucks coffee with LN. 
Bottom line, this is not just about money, and even just money needs more of Bitcoin on-chain transactional capability.
As Roger rightly explained there is no good reason not to increase the block size and even if there was a reason years ago, there is certainly no reason Today or in the near future. Even Chinese miners signalled that they are OK with the higher bandwidth needs behind the GFW of China.
Let's just do it for the sake of Bitcoin's future. Let's go with a max 8MB on the short term and with a dynamic block size on the longer term. This will ensure we keep Bitcoin open for second layer solutions and signal the world that we are able to scale and improve Bitcoin to become a truly global phenomenon.
How the block size increase should be done is up to Core.

Yes, but that's even further down the line. For second layers like LN we need bigger blocks first so we can reliably open and close channels. And remember it's not just LN, there are many other second layer projects all needing on-chain transactions.

The miners were running without interruption at $200- prices, and now the price is $500+.
After halving the effective price for miners will be $500+/2=$250+, still higher than $200-, so it stands to reason they will keep mining.
Also, most will mine even if they are in red, because they as everyone will expect the price to rise further because the supply of new coins is drying up.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:46:40

Which means an uncertainty is removed, thus higher price, thus we will see even more mining power.
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:08:31
Roger is right. I've read every pro and contra argument for months now. And I went back and force on my position. The only reason I'm not a 'big blocker', is because I want to trust the professional integrity of Core. However the arguments for small blocks are weak.
I buy the argument that hard forking could create a bad precedent where majority miners with the help of Core devs can start modifying the code to fit their needs.
But, this benefit is offset by a huge downside. It's inconceivable that we will never want or need to improve the Bitcoin code with a hard fork. We can't do every improvement in the future with hacks and soft forks. This would slow development, create unnecessarily complex code that is hard to review, and much code debt over time. Such complex code will make it prohibitively hard for new developers to join the project in a meaningful way. This process will result in the reduction of decentralization of Bitcoin.
This process cements the position of the Core team more, because they will be the only few people on Earth who understand the code. The community will suffer from a sort of economic Stockholm syndrome, the same way how many people 'trust' the government because they don't understand it fully, and they are at its mercy.
I also buy the argument that the blocks are only full when there is 'spam'.
But, even if the blocks are not yet full, they are getting full naturally because of real use. Even if one raises the fees to resolve the confirmation delays, at one point certain users who can't afford higher fees will be priced out of the network. This will limit the number of users who can use Bitcoin, thus the potentially possible network effects will not be realized, and the value of Bitcoin as a network and as a currency will stay below its potential.
The argument that bigger blocks reduce decentralization is not straightforward. The reduction of nodes because of faster growing blockchain will likely be offset by new users who will want to use (not priced out) Bitcoin because of the bigger blocks. There are already services that allow you send money from USA to Bangladesh for a few dollars. Bitcoin is still competitive and will be a better option for these purposes as long as the fees are well below a dollar, especially for small amounts. We already priced out people and systems who want to send amounts below a dollar. It is likely bigger blocks will increase node count, not reduce because Bitcoin becomes bigger and more relevant in more areas of life.
Sidechains are a solution, but even if we create sidechain solutions to increase the capacity we still need bigger blocks to accommodate the opening and closing of channels, not to mention the many other services that also build on top of Bitcoin, like immutable registries, etc.
Also, it's not clear how effective sidechains will be to replace on-chain transactions. If people really wanted to send 'Bitcoin' over sidechains they can sort of simulate that already by both of them creating a Coinbase account and sending the Bitcoins within Coinbase. Granted they have to trust Coinbase, but even with LN they will have to trust the operator of the channel to a certain extent.
Miners even in China clearly indicated that larger blocks (up to 10MB) won't affect their operation negatively. And with every month bandwidth is less of a risk as internet connectivity is improving everywhere at a rapid pace. Having more users and collecting more fees would be a benefit for them, because it solidifies their customer base for a longer time.
Finally, even though I have tremendous respect for the Core's work, I can't shake the feeling that there is an undeniable conflict of interest in the system. Blockstream (BS) and Core share a big number of developers. BS has a higher chance of success if people use the Lightning Network (LN) developed by BS. People are more likely to use LN if Bitcoin on-chain transactions do not work reliably anymore because of capacity issues. Thus, there is a clear incentive for BS to keep Bitcoin's on-chain capacity small to create demand for LN and consequently make BS' success more likely.
I could be wrong on all these points. Regardless, I'm positive Bitcoin will overcome any issues that lie ahead as the community is strong and smart. Together we can tackle any issue on the long term.

People thought it's too high at 420. Now they wish they could buy at those prices. When the price hits 7-800 you will wish you could be buying at 550.

It's almost certain that many countries will try to ban cryptocurrencies temporarily as they have in the past (and lifted the ban since).
On the long term it doesn't matter, because Bitcoin is invented and designed to circumvent such issues coming from centralization. 
When you have players in the Bitcoin ecosystem from 200 countries of the world, Bitcoin is as much resilient to such attacks as possible.
Also, I bet that the rich and powerful in China already divested into cryptocurrencies, so they don't have a great incentive to ban it anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-18 07:56:18
Even in a world with no block reward, there are fees. Currently without fee pressure 1% of the reward is from fees. As the block reward decreases, and the value of bitcoin increases the percentage of fees in the reward will increase. The expected fee after the next halving will be 3.5%. In 5 years time 7%, then 14%, 30%, 60%... This way the fees replace the block reward.

@_date: 2016-06-22 16:16:53
Well, not really. Currently blocks are at least 90-95% full. It doesn't give much room for any second layer solutions to come on top of it.
If LN launches, on one hand it would certainly remove some pressure from on-chain transactions because it would allow people to send funds through LN instead of on-chain, but on the other hand folks would have to first open one or more channels, just to give themselves the ability to do anything on LN and to test things out. Then, the same people will want to close channels or settle within a few weeks or months even if they only sent one transaction on LN, which creates yet another on-chain transaction. On the short and mid term overall the number of on-chain transactions could increase dramatically because of LN. If the channels do not open and close in a timely and cost effective manner adoption of LN will be slow or fail and thus the optimizations will never actually realize, and we would only see the downsides.
Some small blockers interested in LN's success think that capacity issues increase the chances of LN's success, but in fact that's not the case in my opinion. LN won't win because you can't afford to transact on-chain anymore and thus you're forced to LN. Bitcoin isn't the only game in town and we can't force users to stay with BTC no matter the user experience. Both Bitcoin and LN will lose if there are capacity issues or the on-chain fees are too high. LN should win because it's faster, cheaper, more feature full than regular non-overpriced on-chain transactions and there is an easy and cost efficient way to go back and force between BTC and LN BTC.
Also, it's not a certainty LN will be the huge success most of us expect it to be. If people are game for a sidechain that requires opening a channel and then later closing one to get your BTC, they could already kind of do it by opening for example a Coinbase account and sending coins within the service instantly and for free. Or if they want a cheap decentralized service they could consider something like Litecoin or ETH as a sidechain and convert BTC to those currencies to enjoy fast confirmation times and cheaper fees and go back to BTC when they want to 'settle'. So, LN won't fundamentally solve a huge unserved need. People Today have similar options already.
It is much safer for the entire Bitcoin network if we have significant capacity on-chain to introduce things like LN and Rootstock, and dozens of other services. We need at least 2MB but preferably 8MB+.
As a parallel see how the easy the scaling capability of S3 and other cloud services kickstarted a whole new generation of startups who could scale from 0 to millions of users relatively easily without the constraints of traditional server setups forced on them in the past. We need such a capacity on Bitcoin on-chain too, so many services can easily come on board, and not worry about their users being priced out opening channels.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:50:35
Go all in then. ;)
BTC can't handle the growth in usage at this point beyond 5-10%. BTC price will not grow if there are no new users and hodlers. And, I'm not talking about Segwit either. We need an 8-20MB block HF to be able to scale the userbase 10x to the thousands of $ / BTC range. The network's value lies in the number of nodes. We need more users to grow the network value. I wish it wasn't the case, but I don't see it happening any other way. Hard (no put intended) truth.

It's good you ask! There is no such thing as non-segwit or segwit coins. There is only one Bitcoin (BTC). There are however classic bitcoin addresses and segwit addresses. Classic addresses start with the digit 1 and segwit addresses start with 3. Multi-signature addresses start with 3 as well, but don't worry about those for now. There are also wallets that support segwit address creation and some outdated ones don't. The edge mobile wallet for example is a good wallet that supports segwit addresses. It makes a lot of sense to use a wallet that supports segwit addresses and send all the coins you use for everyday spending to it, because when you spend from such a wallet, you pay much less for fees, and you allow more transactions to be processed by the Bitcoin network, so you indirectly reduce the fees for everyone including yourself. Segwit is backward compatible, so anyone with an old wallet can send to your segwit address (3) and you can send to their classic address (1). Ask if you have more questions!
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:14:31
I agree with what you said, but this part: "smart systems won't use segwit currently because blocks are empty". Even if blocks are empty, it is smart to use segwit because it results in smaller fees, and why waste money if you don't have to even if it's just a few dollars of savings.

The article doesn't even mentions Bitcoin, but to answer your question:
1. USD losing dominance doesn't mean Bitcoin takes its place automatically. The Yuan, the EURO and maybe others will try to dominate, and maybe there will be a new currency will arise which is an aggregate of the USD, EURO, YUAN and a couple of other strong currencies. Bitcoin actually may be part of it, but it's unlikely. Bitcoin doesn't aim to replace the US dollar. It aims to be a safe haven like gold, and an international currency that is used alongside national currencies, so USD's weakening is likely to affect it much. Bitcoin will worth more USD, but not because Bitcoin appreciates, instead the USD is just devaluing.
2. But let's say Bitcoin for some reason does become the world's new global currency. There is a non-insignificant chance it will happen. Bitcoin can't handle the world's transactions currently on the base layer. No crypto can, none comes even close. But Bitcoin can handle the world's transactions on second and third layers. We can have multiple side-chains all pegged on the base layer serving various use cases. RSK will be used for deterministic contracts, Liquid will be used for high value fast transactions between exchanges and import/export companies, Lightning Network can be used for everyday coffee payments, Coinbase and other similar Bitcoin banks can handle payrolls, etc. This system will allow Bitcoin to be stay fully decentralized and thus valuable as a safe haven against centralized systems, yet it will also allow for millions of transactions a second, and a very good user experience with instant virtually free transactions. If this happens we won't be counting in Bitcoins anymore, people will be counting in Satoshis as they will be easier to handle. In other words Bitcoin will appreciate beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Total money worldwide is $80 Trillion. If you divide that by 20 Million bitcoins (discounting for 1M lost), that's roughly 4M US dollars per Bitcoin. Or 4 cents per satoshi. You would be paying something like 25 Sat for a can of Coke. People who currently have thousands of bitcoins will be the new "billionaires" of the world like Bill Gates, and will launch rockets to mine asteroids and populate Mars, etc. :)

No, this has nothing to do with coins in circulation. The amount of bitcoins mined so far is way higher, it's around   
BCash has 1% more coins mined than Bitcoin, because there was a long time when BCash's difficulty was "broken", and the miners could mine an abnormally high number of coins in a short time. This is actually a very bad thing for BCash, because if it stays this way until the next halving, there will be a time when BCash's mining reward halves and Bitcoin's reward hasn't yet. At this point it will be twice as profitable to mine Bitcoin than BCash which means some miners will leave BCash. This will leave BCash with very little hash power temporarily, which allows a rogue agent to attack the chain even easier than they can do now. If this happens both investors and miners will lose confidence and leave the chain, making both the price drop and hashpower further drop too. This can cause a downward spiral and the price will likely stabilize much lower than it was before these events started. What could aggravate the situation is that price could start dropping even before this event in anticipation.

That may all be true, yet my argument still stands.
If somebody starts throwing feces at you because that's what he does when he's angry, are you going to pull your pants down and return the favour hoping you can outdo him? Of course not.
You have your own standards on how you handle disagreement, which should be non-violent rational arguments. If it doesn't work, you should try to put yourself into his mindset, and try to find the right arguments to find his self interest that will change his mind.
Ridicule only works against you. It will alienate the other side from you, and build a mental block against your rational arguments. This may be fun for a short while, but you should only keep doing this if you're willing to sacrifice your own self interest, and keep blaming others to create a false internal narrative of why things are not going your way.

The Bitcoin network can confirm ~2K transactions ~10m in each block.
Blocks are currently full and there are too many transactions in the mempool (40K+) waiting to be confirmed:
You have to wait until everything that is higher priority than yours clears out, then your transaction will confirm as well.

The problem with gold is that its primary value comes from scarcity. If we could make gold cheaply the price would plummet to the price of iron or aluminum. Gold bars would become an annoyance people want to get rid of, rather than hold, like we want to get rid of metal rods or aluminum cans from our homes. 
Currently we can make gold from other metals in nuclear reactors and the price of such metal is higher than mined gold. We also know of a biological process where bacteria produces gold as a byproduct. It is possible in the near future we will have tech that makes gold in ways we didn't even think of. We could be mining asteroids or fuse lighter elements to heavier ones, etc.
Technological innovation is accelerating. Gold will not be scarce or expensive at one point in the future. It may take 10 or 100 years, but the question isn't if, but when. 
Mathematical scarcity however likely always be safe. We will probably need to upgrade the algorithms that run bitcoin, it can always be made to work with proper code.

Hah. Author admits he has difficulty understanding bitcoin and specifically the fork event. Then uses the fork event to argue that it proves bitcoin is not any better than government money because you still need to trusts wallets and miners. Reality: you don't need to trust the wallets, nor miners. You can validate transactions and blocks yourself. In addition miners is not one entity, but a bunch of people and organizations, which makes it much more decentralized than single governments, which do act as single entity. 
The problem with journalism in general is demonstrated perfectly here. Author has to write an article relatively quickly on a subject that he's not fully understanding, let alone immersed in. At the same time journalistic ethics demand that they stay factual and impartial about news. Thus, the authors read a few related documents, form a quick typically hasty and fundamentally incorrect opinion, and present it as factual news (rather than a shallow personal opinion based on incomplete understanding). The reader is duped by the authority of the publication, feels like he's informed, but in reality he gets a potentially misleading jumble of thoughts, not information he can base decisions on.

Alts are more volatile so using them assumes extra risk of losing some value by the time you exchange them into BTC. Also, it may be annoying to set-up and back-up an alt wallet just to receive a few coins, and send them out a few minutes later to exchange them for BTC.
Wallets like JAXX could help with this. They should have a feature which allows you to receive all kinds of alts, and they would be automatically converted to BTC.

They may have large numbers of bitcoin in non-multisig addresses that are non-customer funds. You can't tell how many private keys of paper wallets they have in a safe.

Lightning and other second layer solutions need a bigger block too. Bigger blocks are not optional. 
Calculate how many people can use bitcoin at current blocksize if they only open and close a channel once every 3 month and the network does only this exclusively and all blocks are full: ~11M people. That's the size of one city like NY. The rest of the world won't be able to use Bitcoin.
Realistically we need 8MB+ scaling, and segwit, and Lightning, to be able to serve just 1% of world population. We need 100MB blocks eventually to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer with Lightning and other second layer solutions.
Decentralization will increase as the number of people using Bitcoin increases. Once it becomes mainstream hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world will run nodes. Private people will be he minority. We will have 100x more nodes and thus much stronger decentralization. 
We can keep Bitcoin small and personal forever, or we can increase usage and node count at the same time 100x. It's our choice.

People keep saying that private blockchains are not decentralized, but that's not necessarily true. You could create a privately operated blockchain where a consortium of banks develops the standards and the software, but the mining and full nodes are all operated by individual banks in a decentralized fashion. It is not fully decentralized meaning you and I can't mine or run a node, but when thousands of banks all around the world participate it makes for a pretty good decentralization comparable to Bitcoin. It would be equally hard to pull of an attack on such a network as on the bitcoin blockchain. Such a private blockchain will bring benefits and lower costs compared to current systems.

Well, gold can work as a medium of exchange without the internet or electricity, which is an important thing to have in an apocalyptic scenario. It's a minor benefit over Bitcoin though.
Gold's price could collapse any time somebody invents a currently not existing technology or refines an existing technology to make it economically viable to create gold. There is no mechanism in place to 'raise the difficulty of mining'.
Some examples that are all possible means to create more gold, just not cost effective right now:
* Create from other metals in reactors 
* Microbial processes 
* Asteroid mining

What was the point of the meeting and the agreement if their word mean nothing, and have power do nothing? It was either a deceitful action back than making the miners believe they have a say, or it is now (assuming they decide not to or unable to honour their word) if they wash their hands and say they are not decision makers. Which one is it?
The way I see it, HK was a meeting between lead Core devs representing Core's plans and wishes, and large miners representing the supermajority of miners and their wishes. The objective was to stop Classic's advance, and agree on a mutually satisfactory solution with Core staying in the lead of Bitcoin's development.
They agreed to keep supporting and running Core and activate Segwit, and in return Core will deliver on a block size increase that is in big miner's favour as it assures Bitcoin can grow on chain making it a more stable and relevant network, and miners can collect more fees from more transactions eventually. 
The miners haven't switched to Classic, still running Core's bitcoin flavour, they delivered on their promise.
Core delivered Segwit that will hopefully activate, which was mostly in Core devs (who also work for Blockstream) favour because it builds the foundation for future LN plans, which is going to take the fees away from miners and bring them to Blockstream (with a first mover advantage) and others operating LN channels. This is where Bitcoin goes mainstream and this is where the real money is. Miners have yet to deliver on this. 
So far Core didn't deliver on the block size increase which was the miner's request. I'm hoping that Core will honour their side of the deal and deliver on the block size HF just like miners did / will do.
I'm not siding with any technical solution. I'm just trying to keep the story straight regardless of my preferences.

There is no legal entity as a Core as collective. Core is individuals who have a reputation to uphold if they want to be trusted in the future by the community.

The zombie apocalypse scenario indeed isn't likely or something that Bitcoin can help with. And thus the argument in the first place isn't relevant. You're saying the same thing I'm saying from a different perspective. Thanks.
I'm sure you don't have the same connection Today as 7 years ago. Most people had 1MB/0.1MB back then, now at least 10MB/1MB if not more. And the data caps increased too. Thus, if you could keep up with the blockchain 7 years ago, you can now too with a 10x wider Bitcoin.
Also, if you argue that we should not rely on datacenters for full nodes because they can be easily shut down with a court order, the same applies to your internet connection as well. A court can easily say, no bitcoin related traffic should be allowed by the ISP's and they would shut you down no matter where you run your full node.
It's not like you are running your own private cable to the internet backbone are you? Or, if you're, then you don't have bandwidth issues!
You can't have it both ways... ;)
I agree that Bitcoin shouldn't be a replacement to fiat, it can't be. But it should be a 10x-100x larger currency, so it has more full nodes, more miners, more users, and thus generally more stable and relevant in the world.
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:28:51
If we want to go into such details, we can't just calculate with the storing to savings per family transactions. For each purchase of Bitcoin you need at least one seller. Either a trader or a miner moving coins to the exchange to sell. Thus by default you can cut that 28MB by half to just 14M. So we are up to 0.2% of world population, if Bitcoin was perfectly optimized just for this singular purpose and nothing else, which is clearly unrealistic.
Such a system that is running on full capacity at all times is highly fragile because a spam attack can force you out of the network (for example to force people out of exchanges for a certain amount of time). Thus, it's bad for the security of the system, which is not something we want.

BTC would be at ATH measured in USD too, if the USD wasn't so strong recently. There are many reasons why the USD is strong:
1. Euro and other currencies are doing bad. People are escaping to the USD from their local currencies. This will likely flip at a certain point, when people will start buying cheap local currencies to gain on rebounds.
2. Strong US economy. The USA reinvented itself and leads in many key industries again. This trend will keep going for decades. The US has a unique system that attracts talent, investment, and allows relatively free capitalism that generates more and more efficiencies.
3. Interest rates in other developed countries are dropping. The USD is better in this regard. This can't go on forever.
4. US trade is increasingly more balanced, with more exports. This effect reached peak. Won't help further.
5. Government budgets improved. Reduced spending, more taxes collected. Who knows where this goes... :)

There is a chance he could be right, but it's more likely Andreas is going to be right, who said something like, while Bitcoin not be absolutely perfect, it's very big and strong and works just fine, and will allow second layers make it even better. It's unlikely that other Blockchains will dislodge it as the leader.

* Owns a ton of bitcoin (like hundreds of thousands)
* Many care for, or trust his opinion as a businessman on bitcoin related things (even though he's not a developer) so he does have control over public opinion to an extent

@_date: 2016-12-05 22:21:45
This makes total sense.
We need bigger blocks to support LN (and potentially other second layer or side chain solutions).
Currently if all Bitcoin did was to serve LN as a settlement layer, and users only opened and closed a channel once a quarter, we could only serve 11M people, which is just one city the size of NYC. It's just 0.1% of the world. Not bad, but not nearly enough.
Just for LN and nothing else, we need at least 8-20MB blocks even if we have segwit. This capacity would allow Bitcoin to become a relevant financial network that can serve ~200M-500M people around the world.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:50:45
We need 4MB+ for the second layer solutions, not for the coffee purchases. At 1MB LN, Rootstock and half a dozen other second layer services won't have enough capacity to open and close channels or settle contracts.
On chain coffee purchases would need 1GB+.

This is straw-man argument. r/btc has all kind of bitcoiners including people who don't support SegWit and others who support it. There everything is allowed, unlike here, so you will see anti-SegWiters too. And I'm not saying this as a complaint. Every sub should have it's own rules and I respect them.

@_date: 2016-11-24 02:42:16
I understand your argument, but follow it through to the end.
If you ever wanted to use Bitcoin because the dollar failed, you would not be able to because there is no capacity.
That is not a problem with guns. When you have to use it, you can.
So, if you really wanted a backup financial system, you need to balance capacity, and the ability to run it at home. As we have faster connection and cheaper storage, we can slowly raise the minimum requirements for running bitcoin at home. 10x every 5 years is reasonable. It's been 7 years without an increase. It's really about time. 
I'd rather spend an extra $25 (250GB) on a hard disk so I can run a full node for another few years, than $2 on a single transaction. It is cheaper to raise the blocksize than trying to keep up with raising fees.
Tell me this is not logical. :)

For the banks, what is the benefit of this system compared to a regular database ran by a central bank and its trusted branches or partners? We already have such distributed databases that write data at virtually any data rate required. It's wasteful and overcomplicated to use a blockchain for such purposes.
From a customer point of view, this system doesn't have any of the positive attributes of bitcoin, because it requires trust, requires a central authority, the blockchain can be rewritten by a single entity on will, and the supply of coins can be increased by any rate. In other words the central authority can take your money if they decide so, and generate more money to reduce the value of the coins you hold. Also, the two levels of blocks will likely be slower than the ~10 minute confirmation time. Sounds like the settlement is daily on the central bank's level.
From an auditors point of view there is no benefit either, because the central bank has the power to manipulate the blockchain as they deem fit by only including transactions from mintettes that support their version of the 'truth' since they can select which mintettes can submit transactions. And, beyond that, since they are the only ones to hold a copy of the blockchain, they can simply rewrite it on will and nobody will know. There is no proof of work, and thousands of copies of the blockchain, as in Bitcoin that force all the players be honest. The auditor either has to have a copy of the blockchain at all times, and has to have a veto power over mintettes selection, or they are effectively blind. But if they do have these things, they basically take the role of the central bank, and thus the same issue of a rogue auditor comes into play, thus you would need an auditor of the auditor keep them honest. Etc. If you do that you end up with Bitcoin.
Thus, basically the banks, and the customers, or the government wins nothing by implementing this system. If there is a hidden benefit, it's definitely not clear from the presentation.
Also, the negatives of Bitcoin are kinda misconstructed:
• Hashing rates 'being out of control' is an emotional argument. One could say the electricity usage is wasteful, because the same amount of transactions could be written to a database with less energy, but that ledger would not be trustless, thus the value of that database would be virtually useless compared to the blockchain generated by the Bitcoin network which is trusted by all the miners and users. It's like saying the IRS is wasteful because we could save money by simply trusting people to pay their taxes.
• This altcoin's blockchain size would be enormous and would grow hundreds of times faster at 2K transactions per second than Bitcoin's. The data written by this alt coin isn't any more efficient than Bitcoin's. In fact, because the transactions are much more complex, it's very likely the transactions would 'waste' significantly more space.
• Governments would be more vary of this alt coin than Bitcoin, if they realize that the gatekeeper has the power to create money out of nothing and can rewrite financial transaction history. In Bitcoin you can't steal or devalue people's money this way.
• All the 'attacks on mining' would be equally present with this alt coin as on other crypto blockchain and more, because it's more complicated and thus the surface of attack is larger.
• If you trust entities you can already use 'Bitcoin' offchain, like on exchanges or online wallets like Coinbase. So, Bitcoin doesn't suffer from the supposed problem that it only supports public transactions and doesn't take advantage of a trusted setup.

Some people were concerned that Bitcoin is 'just' the first crypto, and newer or better versions of it will eventually take over. But it looks like Bitcoin is proving itself to be very resilient, and its simplicity and the relative conservative approach in its development is its strength, not a weakness.
Bitcoin's largest competitor in the crypto space Ethereum is not doing that well nowadays facing many problems including governance, hacks, relatively serious bugs, etc.
All the desired features like instantaneous 'confirmation', anonymity, high-capacity, programmability seem to be solvable on top of Bitcoin, and is being worked on by multiple parties. These solutions, one by one will make Bitcoin even stronger and more dominant in the next years.
I think putting something like 5-10% of your savings into BTC at this stage is not unreasonable at all. Everything has risks, but the potential of Bitcoin is much bigger, than comparable other assets. Gold for example will not likely to suddenly gain value because of a new use case. Even when comparing Bitcoin to tech stocks, Bitcoin seems more attractive. A tech company competes with several other companies in the same space, but in case of Bitcoin all the various teams working on improving the Bitcoin ecosystem and even the alts are helping Bitcoin to improve and thus increase in value.

The creation of new money (dollars) would be done by mining instead of central banks creating it. All existing digital money would be converted into pre-mined coins. All paper money could be turned into coins too. Huge logistic headache but doable.
The mining and running of nodes would be available only to entities that are allowed by the software (banks), so if regular folk wanted to mine coins they would not be validated by the official nodes.
However, regular folks would be able to transfer these bank coins without banks just like cash. But the banks would be mining the transactions for folks.
Since the banks would have huge resources, they could easily run a blockchain with virtually no limits.
Granted, there are many issues, for example if the consortium controls the entities who can run nodes and mine, they could effectively control the whole system, but that's not a big difference from what is happening today in the banking system. The same power structure would be realized on the blockchain.
The private blockchain could be attacked by spam transactions, or other means, but the current banking systems are under constant attack anyway. Same problem, just manifested differently.
I don't think it will happen any time soon, but it could be done.
@_date: 2016-12-14 16:59:13

Move the money to an exchange and put buy orders at various levels below the current price and wait. -1% to -5%. There is a risk however. The price may go further up never to return to current -5%. 
The reason you should buy is to diversify your portfolio in case something goes wrong with your other investments. So buying in all at once is still a good idea if you don't want to risk waiting.
@_date: 2016-11-24 06:08:33
Thanks for your answer, but I think you got this wrong.
The more blocks are full naturally, the easier and cheaper to do a spam attack. If your 1MB blocks are typically 0.95MB full, you only need to fill up 0.05MB with spam. If your 8MB blocks are 3MB full, you need 5MB worth of spam, which is 100x more expensive.
The fees only help if your blocks are 100% full, but at that point you don't need a spam attack because the network is chocking naturally. In practice it starts to exclude users and use cases that can't warrant a high enough fee. These users and use cases will move to other blockchains, thus starving Bitcoin of potential user base growth, which would benefit everyone within the network.

Also, remember by smart we don't mean they have any intelligence. They are just deterministic. They still rely on an oracle to execute. 
In other words: you can create a smart contract that pays a merchant automatically when goods are delivered, but you still rely on an external party for example fedex to trigger the code to act. For example when the state of delivery changes to delivered. There is no way to execute the contract like this without such 'manual' third party. 
In some cases the oracle could be an event that doesn't rely on a third party. For example: time. You could create a smart contract for the purposes of a will, which says: move the full amount on my savings account to my son's account if my account doesn't receive new deposits from a certain address for over 60 days automatically. This way, as long as you are alive and contribute at least a satoshi to your savings account, your savings account doesn't move. But when you die, you stop contributing for 60 days the smart contract executes and sends all funds to your son.

Government or bank cryptos will only help Bitcoin because they legitimize the concept of cryptos and teach people about keys, wallets, etc. Wallets like jaxx will allow people to hold more than one crypto, shapeshift will allow you to move from one to another easily, and thus people who never had BTC will hold Bitcoin as the second international currency.

Not an eternity. There will be a time in the not too distant future when lost coins can be unlocked by supercomputers.

It's not even enough for a fraction of the world, even if it's just for cold storing savings.
Most people make a monthly contribution to their savings. So let's say, just 12 transactions a year / person. At this very modest use case Bitcoin can serve 7M people, which is less than people living in Manhattan, and it's just 0.1% of the world population. This, if the full Bitcoin capacity was dedicated to this single purpose, no LN, no Rootstock, no traders, nothing else.
At 1MB or even with 2MB with Segwit Bitcoin will remain largely irrelevant in the world. With such a limit, Blockchain tech will move to other currencies that scale better, and eventually replace Bitcoin for all purposes, including store of value. Bitcoin will keep on running, and people will use it for sentimental purposes, but it will not fulfill it's real potential.

"*We can predict a severely congested bitcoin network during the next bull run in 2020-2021,” Jiang said, “ But of course, Bitcoin Core developers will see it as a ‘transaction fee market’ rather than the ‘ congestion’.”*
I think that's true. We will see a congestion, because Segwit adoption will not grow fast enough to alleviate the increased transaction demand during a bull-run when new people are on-boarding to Bitcoin creating wallets and sending newly acquired coins to themselves. LN won't help in this scenario, because we're talking about new people, not existing users using LN channels that have already been set-up in the past.
On, one hand everyone is wishing the next run-up to come as fast as possible, but on the other hand we should hope for more time to have more Segwit adoption, and perhaps even the introduction of Schnorr so we can consolidate signatures better.

That's one way to tell the story, but I think XT would've been a positive story, a reason to buy, because it opens Bitcoin to mainstream adoption with ever increasing number of transactions. It's the 1MB folks who spun the story in a way that make XT sound like a dangerous thing. I know both sides have the best intentions, but internal war is never good as it creates uncertainty.
I see this whole scenario as part of the Bitcoin experiment. This had to happen sooner or later if not because of blocksize, something else. It's important to learn from the events and plan for the future. We knew it's not going to be easy. It's a learning process. Don't be angry, even if you lost money.

Mining creates inflation pressure, but there are many deflation pressures too.
For one: lost coins, which is much more than most people realize. Almost every single bitcoiner lost some crypto at least once and some lost huge amounts. I'm sure this makes up at least 1-2% overall.
Second: dollar is inflating too at 3% (ex. USD), so the yearly 10% BTC inflation in relation to USD or other currencies is really only 7%. In other words if there were no lost coins you would only need to spend 7% in order the maintain the price at the same level.
Third: the amount of BTC that is in circulation and bought for holding by anybody for investment is also increasing. New bitcoin companies are buying BTC for cashflow purposes. Increased use adds more BTC to the pool of cash flow. This is probably at least 1% overall if not more.
So, with these three the 10% reduces the amount need to be bought up for investment to only ~5%, which brings up an interesting question. What happens after halving when the 10% becomes 5%? We should see buying pressure on BTC. Partly it's already calculated in, in other words people buying the 5% Today do it partly because they expect an increase in price because of halving, but that's not a typical reason.
I think what will happen is that the price will go up to the $500-600 range to increase the value of BTC, so the lower amount of BTC mined can still satisfy the same needs as the $250-300 price did. If it goes above $600 (especially if it's significantly above it) it would be the right to sell because it's just speculation, not a reflection of real market needs.

Btw. LN became significantly faster recently.
I think the algos finding the routes have improved a lot. Node operators learned the good way to organize channels. And it helps that the value of bitcoin went up, thus the same $10 is now ⅓ of the satoshis it used to take just a few months ago. 
A few months ago, LN payments failed at least 5-10% of the time and sometimes took 5-10 seconds to find a route. Now, they don’t seem to fail and they seem to always happen instantly. I’m sure mileage varies depending on your capacity and choice of nodes to open channels with, but it generally feels like LN is growing in quality not just quantity.

People have different risk tolerances and interpret the same facts differently. It's wrong of you to think that just because the other side thinks differently they are intellectually inferior.
Some people feel it's a bigger risk for bitcoin to stagnate than take on a risk that comes with change. Some people accept that change is a constant in life and managing change is the low risk option. Other people think that fighting change and being extra conservative is the low risk option. They are both intellectually reasonable approaches. They are just different. And none of us know the future, nor can we anticipate the actions and reactions of various players, so let's play nice and value each other's differences, not decry them as idiots.

More frequent blocks also means that an attacker has a higher chance to double spend. It's more reasonable to take over a network for 30-120 seconds than 5-15 minutes.
So it makes sense for the gold of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) to maintain a relatively long confirmation time of 10 minutes as a reserve currency for savings and large payments.
We can use a Bitcoin sidechain or other fast cryptos for everyday small transactions, where the amounts stored on the network are smaller and thus a higher risk is acceptable.
Bitcoin is your safe, and sidechains are your wallet.

I think on the long term the miner's interest lies in Bitcoin becoming more widely used, which translates to more transactions. Nowadays some blocks come with a total fee reward of BTC 0.5. If we had 8MB or 20MB filled blocks those rewards could potentially increase to 4BTC or 10BTC, which would increase their profits considerably. This will become especially important when the block reward drops to 12.5 in a year.
If we kept the 1MB cap the average transaction fees would have to rise from 3 cents to $0.3-$0.6, which would kill Bitcoin for micro transactions and for colored coins, etc. as the fee would be in the 10-50% range compared to the value sent. Bitcoin's ecosystem would have to completely and fundamentally change and also Bitcoin would lose one of its biggest appeals blocking some of the growth.

I agree that raising the block size limit for this purpose is stupid. But that's not the reason we want to raise the limit. It's to make Bitcoin future proof when we will run tons of services on top of Bitcoin's blockchain. They will all look like "spam", because they are very small transactions, yet completely legit.
We don't know, maybe a service like Nasdaq or Overstock's exchange is testing the bitcoin network if it can handle tons of small transactions. Bitcoin shouldn't fail these tests.

It's the same bitcoin, but upgraded. Different software that runs the same protocol with a small but significant change. It will allow larger blocks, which means 8 times as many transactions can be processed every 10 minutes. It also means it will cost like 20x more expensive to spam attack the Bitcoin network at current transaction rates.
As a "downside" if we start to fill up the 8MB blocks with transactions the blocks will be larger (8MB instead of 1MB) thus the blockchain will grow in size faster. It will also mean that the roughly 100GB monthly bandwidth required to run a node will grow to maybe 500GB or more. However these changes won't be instantaneous. Nothing significant will change for now, the block sizes will only grow gradually and over several months, which will give time for hardware and internet providers to adapt.
But this is a good problem to have. It would mean that Bitcoin has 8x times as many transactions and will graduate from being equivalent in size to a micro island nation to a small sized nation. It would also allow the Bitcoin network to be used by non-currency based applications, like identity verification, smart contract, yadda-yadda all making Bitcoin's blockchain ever more important in the world economy. The increased number of transactions would also allow sidechains like the Lightning network, Nasdaqs trading platform, etc. to settle lots transactions on the Blockchain without jamming up the network.
Also, in the future the 8MB will grow further without a hard fork. Further growth to medium sized nation and large nation size in 8-10 years will be supported out of the box. Eventually the cap will grow so big that it will allow Bitcoin to become THE worldwide ledger everybody trusts for everything around the world including land titles, loan management for banks, digital passports, etc.

So if he keeps this up for let's say 9-10 hours in total over a few days, it's 100 BTC = $30K cost for attack.
He would have to buy 10K Litecoin at an average of $2 and it sell it at $5 on average just to cover the cost of the attack.
If he bought 100K LTC he would double his ~$250K investment in a few days. $250K is only 1% of the daily LTC volume, so it's possible to pull off if not easy.

@_date: 2015-07-06 23:22:46
Increasing fees is just as silly to deter spam as increasing the block size. The miners can compete with the real transactions until the fees make Bitcoin borderline unattractive to use for transferring value. Similar effect, but the increased cost will appear on the user's side as opposed to the miner's side. The big difference is that block size increase helps scale the Bitcoin network, fee increase does nothing positive unless I'm missing something.
What does child pays parent means?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:18:53
Demonstrates the advantages of Litecoin vs Bitcoin. Litecoin can process 4x as many transactions, because the same 1MB blocks are created every 2.5 minutes, as opposed to 10 minutes with Bitcoin.
If you create congestion on Bitcoin, and people can't move coins in reasonable amount of time, they will start thinking that maybe Litecoin or other faster cryptos have a bigger future.
This of course is not the case. Bitcoin is just going through growing pains. If Bitcoin crashes because of this issue it will be time to buy because as soon as the blocksize limit is lifted or increased on Bitcoin the pump will begin again.
It is also possible that whoever is doing these games will buy into Bitcoin with high value Litecoins, and then spam the Litecoin network the same way they do Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:30:18
The "much less room for spam" argument makes no sense. The spam is accumulated and causes a congestion in the mempool which has no cap, not in the mined blocks. Once they are mined they are not causing a problem anymore.
Yes, 3GB/day is a problem, but it's a smaller problem than a dysfunctional network. What's the use of a compact blockchain that can't serve the users at a reasonable speed and cost?

@_date: 2015-07-07 20:31:54
I think the difficulty to spam with an increased block size is not proportional to the block size itself, because a smaller block size will always be fuller to start with, so the attacker has less percentage to contribute to create congestion.
For example if we have 1MB blocks that are typically 80% full, the attacker has to fill up only 0.2MB, but with 20MB blocks at the same number of legit transactions he would have to fill 19.2MB. So with 20MB blocks you need to spend not just 20x more, but 96x more. Almost two magnitudes more money needs to be spent. Very effective against attackers.
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:21:58
You signed a document a few years ago that says that blocksize increase IS on the table. Having said that I agree that we should not do a block size increase before Schnorr is implemented as it will provide some relief and will increase the effectiveness of any block size increase.
Did you consider ALL the parameters that incentivize and deincentivize node operators? Try to think by putting yourself into various user's shoes, beyond your own experience of running a full node as a dev.
For example, if you're a merchant, would you more likely set up a bitcoin full node if you can only serve 300K users worldwide or if you can serve 3M (with a larger block size)? The difference is even larger if you consider that a reduced block size almost certainly will kill the security model of LN because of high fees, and non-cooperative channel closure being profitable attack methods. So we may be talking about a difference of 300K vs 30M users.
The same goes for an investor saving for retirement. A smaller user base gives an investor less confidence in Bitcoin, thus less likely to invest, and thus run a full node to receive Bitcoin from exchanges.
It's almost guaranteed that decreasing the block size will decrease the number of nodes to an extent. For many users, the network will have less value from a transaction throughput perspective, thus there is less incentive to run the full nodes. With reduced nodes the network's core value of decentralization is lost to a degree too.
We've seen with Ethereum that increased adoption increases the node count too, even if the blockchain grows faster.

@_date: 2019-04-09 04:04:46
The fact that we've been through the debate once before, doesn't mean it should never come up again, and again in the future. As times change technology improves, Bitcoin is different now with Segwit and LN, than a few years ago, thus the discussion will change. Even the Core scaling plan published on [bitcoin.org]( mentions a block size increase as an eventual method to support second layers.
It all comes down to node count. The more full nodes verify transactions the more decentralized Bitcoin is, and thus more valuable it is. However, we should not automatically assume that smaller blocks increase or protect node count. The size of the blockchain is just one of the factors that limit full node operators. Let's look at a list of incentives in both scenarios:
**Small (1MB base block):**
* Smaller blockchain requires less disk space. Disk space requirements grow continuously, so even at 1MB one will have to buy a bigger disk eventually. At 1MB the blockchain [grows]( only at \~13GB/year. Which means a 500GB disk will last another 20 years before it fills up. With \~2M the same legacy disk would only last 10 years, which is still perfectly OK. The price difference between a 500GB and 1TB disk is now like \~$15 only. Clearly, disk space is not a significant problem.
* Smaller blocks require smaller CPU capacity to process. This seems to be a limiting factor at initial sync only. Currently it takes days on a slow computer to set up a full node. Consequently, the processing is not an issue even with slow CPUs. Increasing the block size would only gradually increase the blockchain at the end of the sync, so initial sync would not double, just increase by 10-15% in a year, so it only means a few extra hours for a year or two. If we look at the lowest cost computers Raspis, the CPU [performance improves]( 300% on each version every few years. So, increasing the block size slowly shouldn't pose any issues for node operators.
* High fees incentivize users to run full nodes + LN nodes to be able to use LN and avoid high fees. But very high fees also prohibit safe operation of LN. So, here we need to be very careful and balance needs.
**Large blocks (\~1MB+ base block):**
* Smaller average mempool crashes weak full nodes less often. See how the [mempool increase]( in the beginning of April coincides with [drop in node count]( Small increases in memory needs can be managed as memory is getting cheaper too, but if the mempool growth to 400-1,000MB from the 'normal' 10-20MB, that's too fast and node operators may run into issue. They can of course drop transactions, but then they are becoming less useful as a full node.
* More transactions with low fees attracts more Bitcoin users and reduces the need for alts — Bitcoin Maximalism becomes reality — and thus there will be more users and merchants running full nodes. We may lose 10% of nodes due to the larger blocks, but we may gain 20% more nodes due to increased usage, resulting in a net gain of 10%, which increases the safety and value of the network.
* Safer LN due to ample on-chain transaction capacity and low fees increases LN, thus more people set-up full Bitcoin nodes to be able to run LN nodes. However if the fees are very low, people may not care to switch to LN in the first place, just keep transacting on the main chain. Thus, there should be a good balance. Maybe the increase is not straight to 2MB, instead just 1.25MB, slowly increasing so we keep fee pressure high enough to incentivise second layer growth, yet low enough to enable its security.
Assuming you're convinced of a small block size increase is beneficial to Bitcoin, is it even possible to push through a block size increase safely? Yes, but only if the following criteria has been met:
* Schnorr has been implemented and thus we ran out of on-chain optimizations. Once we have Schnorr, any block size increase will be much more impactful in term of transaction throughput and thus less controversial.
* The block size increase is gradual, slow. and long term (we don't need to hard fork multiple times). Not 2MB / 4MB / 8MB, but rather something like +0.25MB per year, resulting in 1.25MB, 1.5MB, 1.75MB, 2MB. This is very modest and will keep a balance between moderately high fees to keep the network secure, and the pressure for more on-chain transaction space to keep the second layers safely operational. Now maybe it's not: +0.25MB, but only: +0.1M or higher: +0.5MB. I don't know... But the idea is to keep the kettle boiling, and yet keep relieving some pressure on it so it doesn't just blow up.
* The block size increase is supported by the dozens of Core devs working on Bitcoin, and is implemented in the Core software. The hard fork should not split the community. Obviously we can't make everybody happy. Some will want to lower the blocksize rather than increase it. Others want a faster increase. But there is a good chance we won't have a significant split in the chain or the community if the initiative is supported by the most well-respected devs in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Mining empty blocks was incentivized by the protocol anyway because of faster propagation. We accept it because there is a another more important and longer term incentive for miners, which is keeping the network useful, thus processing transactions. What's different with Asicboost?
Bitcoin should not rely on good actors. If Bitcoin needs constant social campaigns to paint certain undesirable players as evil by spinning things out of proportion, we may have to improve things in more fundamental ways.

Gotcha, so basically it is cheaper to buy 100x$4, than buying 1x$400 because you are always buying at the lowest available price. I'm not sure about the 130-135 vs 145 difference though. I think it would not be more than a dollar or two at most. The difference in price would be significant if you were to buy $40K at once, but not at $400.

Not a problem. Classic nodes work exactly as Satoshi nodes strengthening and helping the network until Classic reaches 75% in mining (not nodes), at which point Classic is more widely supported than Core, so again Bitcoin is still OK. In fact this shows that the system works as intended.

Fantastic visualisation.
Demonstrates well why bitcoin maximalists believe that on the long run there will only be one big crypto. Money earns trust with time, and money earns value from acceptance, which takes time too. Every day Bitcoin remains the most secure, the most stable, most accepted, and most well known currency, the more likely the one big crypto is going to be: **Bitcoin**.
Winning with features on the other hand is very hard, unless you can offer significantly (10x) better user experience. And at this point it's very hard to provide 10x better features than existing systems. If you want censorship resistant, international, permissionless money, you've got Bitcoin. If you want nearly universal acceptance and instant electronic transactions, you've got USD with PayPal or Credit Cards. Tokenisation, deterministic contracts, etc. are cool ideas, but so far 'money' is the only 'smart' contract that gained widespread use, and there is tons of competition for a good solution on those v2, v3 cryptos.
If you wanted 10x better experience, you would have to come with a crypto that is:
* Active dev team that is made of thousands of best experts in the world.
* Brand that is at least twice as well known and trusted than Bitcoin AND PayPal.
* New consensus finding mechanism, that is not POW or DAG, and safer than Bitcoin POW.
* Decentralised and secured by several hundred thousand full nodes.
* Worldwide acceptance with hundreds of exchanges.
* "Full nodes" on your phone, no third party trust required.
* Dozens of instant, super easy multisig wallets for all systems.
* Instantly confirming transactions for any amount.
* Fully recoverable funds with seed words.
* Mobile online (hot) wallets that are inherently safe enough to hold even large funds.
* Optionally perfectly anonymous, yet inflation can be independently verified.
* Point and click deterministic contracts without the need for oracles.
* Virtually free transactions.
* Earn small fees for running nodes, securing the network, or routing transactions even with a phone.
There has been a lot of competition in general for the 2-10th places over the years as evidenced by the visualization. And, without a doubt most of the alts in those positions will be pushed down by newcomers with bigger promises in the near future. Once Peercoin, Auroa, etc. was the shit of the day promising to change the crypto landscape because of their distribution methods, features, etc. Then, a new set of alts came along with a bigger idea. There are many new coins on the horizon with even bigger promises. This is a great testing ground for Bitcoin, and benefits Bitcoin a great deal providing real world experiments.

Being concerned and exploring the possible issues is good.
However, we never know what will happen in the future in result of our decisions with absolute certainty. No matter how well we analyzed something, as long as the system is complex because people are involved there is a chance something can go in ways we didn't expect it to. Risk is part of life. The idea is to mitigate risks and not be blocked by a hypothetical possibility of things going wrong.
If you are paralyzed by the possibility of some unknown risks that may affect you, you're exposing yourself to another type of risk, which could be bigger than the potential unknown risks you are trying to avoid. Inaction and stagnation is a sure way to fail in a system where everything else is changing.
I can't judge what's a sufficient amount of exploration around Hard Forks. Peter Todd surely knows better than me. I'm just highlighting a general concept around risk reduction.
There is a mental condition where certain individuals are unable to make simple decision and move forward with their lives because they have an innate need to over-analyze every single small decision they need to make. This attitude assures that they make the best possible decision in the morning when choosing what footwear to wear for the day, but it also has the side effect of being very late to every single meeting or date, and thus in the bigger scope of things the diligent decisions of the morning ruin the person's day. These people are basically unable to live a normal life.
Also, we can't dismiss the possibility that there is no real issue here of inability to take risks or make decisions confidently. It's possible there is a deeper fundamental reason for arguing against Hard Forks in any way possible. Also, proposing a 95%+ threshold basically ensures the Hard Fork never activates, which could be the real objective. I'm not suggesting this is the case here.

Why do people think 1MB is enough, even with segwit and lightning network? If segwit activates and we have effective 2-3MB blocks, and we have LN, and Bitcoin users only open and close a channel just once every 3 month we can serve at most 20-30M people. This is like 0.3% of the global population. We need blocksize increase not instead of LN, but for the vision of LN to come true.
So we need all of this: Blocksize increase, segwit, LN, experienced developers.
How can we make this happen? Core should please both camps by providing a proposal that has all of the above: official 2MB+ block + segwit proposal by Core.
But nodes!
Since the price of bandwidth, storage, memory, and computing is continuously dropping, there is no danger that we will have considerably less nodes if we increase the blocksize. And with wider Bitcoin adoption realized by the LN vision, the number of nodes will likely increase and offset any nodes coming offline who can't keep up.
But fees!
Cheap fees is not a problem either. If at 1MB the fee is 1$ and at 10MB the fee is 0.1$, the miners earn the same amount, but they serve a 10x bigger market which makes their business more robust, which is a good thing for them. This is especially true if the mining reward worth more thanks to a higher price of Bitcoin.
There is one clear and safe path ahead. We should take it if we want Bitcoin to become a global success, increase in value, and want to provide banking to the poor and unbanked. There is no disadvantage, only upsides.

You're correct, but what would be the benefit of using a private blockchain? They could just record every transaction on a giant spreadsheet and put it on the web. They don't need any of the blockchain technology for this purpose.
If they do need any blockchain, they need one that is secure enough to rely on, hence Bitcoin. They can't just launch a private one that nobody mines, unless they are want to launch a Nasdaq Coin and plan to take-on Bitcoin.

If payment for the coffee is consistently not secure, Bitcoin won't be accepted for coffee payments, nor any other payment. Thus, we would lose the primary use case of Bitcoin. It can still remain digital gold for store of wealth, but the value of the units decrease because it's less useful than originally imagined, thus the store of value function suffers too. 
Since payments is a big need in the market and Bitcoin can be replaced for payments with a clone, the payment function could move to other blockchains, generating widespread acceptance for the clone. At that point the clone becomes more attractive as a store of value as well. Thus Bitcoin loses all use cases. 
Money is valuable only if people accept it as money. If they don't because they use a different network, there is no value to it. 
Discounting the coffee scenario has more consequences than not being able to buy a hot beverage.

XT and Classic has done its job. Keeping Core on its toes. This meeting would have not have happened without Classic. And I think this shows the power of a decentralized system. Core had to appease the needs of a wider community and can't do whatever they want.
Having said that I think this agreement has lots of wiggle room. If Core wants the HF not to happen, they can set up the rules in a way that it is controvercial enough for miners around the world not to reach the set limits with a given time. Thus they can blame the miners why the HF didn't happen and continue on with the original plan of a small Bitcoin. 
I don't think this will happen though. I have faith in Core that they will keep their promise made here and they are not just screwing over the community with a political manouver.

The only trouble with the idea of 'turning it off' is that you need the consent of Bitmain to soft or hard fork bitcoin to 'fix' the asic boost advantage, as they control enough mining power to block any change.
Thus, you're asking Bitmain who benefits from this hack to give up their profits for no short or mid term benefit to them. This will not happen.
There are two ways this can play out for Bitcoin as I see it now:
* We hard fork and Bitcoin splits, Bitmain will control 100% of the old chain. Nobody knows how people will react, both Bitcoins could retain value for a long time.
* Other mining companies develop the same tech, and sell them in countries where the Bitmain patent doesn't apply, and thus over a few years the profits even out and Bitmain will not have an economic incentive to block progress.
Question is, how come this bug was only discovered now? Do Bitmain has 'better' hackers than Bitcoin Core devs?

The fact that it's a new narrative doesn't make it wrong. This experiment is evolving.
In the future we will probably have a conservative Bitcoin that is very secure, perhaps very valuable, but has a limited bandwidth with high transaction fees for high value transactions, like major business deals and bulk exports.
Next to Bitcoin we will have a major alt perhaps Litecoin that is faster, has more bandwidth, has cheaper transaction feeds, but less secure for small low value transactions like a coffee. The two together will be used for various purposes in various situations. And both will be augmented with many different "side-chains".
Next to these major two we will have tens of thousands of various alts for various purposes. There will be government issued cryptos, even kids will create currencies in schools like they make YouTube channels nowadays, there will be currencies for specific technical purposes like Ether or Namecoin, and finally we will have all commodities and fiats represented as colored coins too.
Wallets will support the top 100 cryptos by default, and you will be able to pay to anyone regardless of what crypto the merchant wants, because the wallet will make the conversion on your side automatically. Certain smart wallets will trade for you automatically based on your risk tolerance settings. You can set it to diversify your assets as much as possible to preserve your wealth, or you can set it to high risk and hope it can increase your wealth over time.

This questions their motives opposing segwit. But it doesn't make them evil. 
Bitcoin is designed to be resistant to change and keep the protocol in place using POW, even if the protocol is flawed (or as you call it buggy). Miners are incetivized to find all possible ways to mine as hard as they can using anything the system allows. It's not their fault if there is a bug they were not intended to take advantage.

Technically this is true, not?
He didn't say that regular nodes are useless. That's only implied if you want to read something into his tweet that he didn't say. Thus, criticism based on this is a strawman fallacy. 
He just said they slow down true full nodes, which is true because regular nodes can have fake information, thus they can't be trusted to relay correct block info for miners. If they did mine based on fake block info they would be mining invalid blocks and lose money.
Regular nodes are useful for the person running the node, because he doesn't need to trust a third party. He can pull and store the block info from the mining nodes, directly or indirectly. And they can also be useful for other non-mining nodes to pull block info from.

1TB is not enough though. With a 10MB block plus segwit you are looking at 1TB of data every 3-4 months! 
So within a year you are looking to have to spend thousands of dollars on hardware and hundreds of dollars per month on internet connection and there is close to zero incentive for an individual to do it. 
On the other hand with LN you can run a 1MB + segwit full bitcoin node plus an LN node on a modest laptop with a 100GB capped internet connection, which also makes you money with fees, so there is a strong incentive.

But that also includes math. Bitcoin will need to prepare for the quantum era, and prepare a hard fork. I personally think, it would make sense to hard fork to a quantum proof algo as soon as possible, so we have less coins in addresses that are not quantum safe.
We will still have millions of bitcoins that are mineable with quantum computers. Bitcoin will be the canary in the coal mine, when we see ancient Bitcoins getting unlocked, we will know quantum computing is here. It is possible Bitcoin was created by a government agency for this very reason, so they have a huge incentive to publicly alert secret agencies that encryption we rely on is no longer safe.

NO2X people repeatedly said they are open to block size increase, but in a way that is more future proof so we don’t have to keep forking bitcoin. And they also want to include other improvements in a potential fork. So, the dismissal is technical in nature primarily. 
Secondarily, NO2X people don’t want to lose control of the bitcoin development. And they want people to continue using the code that Core releases. This is our best option because Core is made of a lot of talent and together they can do a better and safer job maintaining and improving Bitcoin. A smaller 2X team can’t compete with Core. It’s in our best interest to stay with Core. 
I support all the above as well. However, I think it’s a really bad idea to continue the smear campaign against 2X people. It’s wrong to try to defend your side by trying to destroy the character of your opponent rather than arguing against their ideas. It is also counter productive to the end goal. We want as many people in the bitcoin community as possible including 2X people. They do have great value in many different ways. We have to convince them with calm and intelligent arguments. We have to find what brings them on board. Spend your creative energy finding how to convince them. Alternatively, if you don’t care and don’t have time to find new ways to convince 2X folks, just move on and don’t bother arguing against them any further at all.
We all get carried away by our emotions, but we can overcome it. We can continue the discussion in a respectful manner, and since we have the right idea, we will be able to get through to 2X people. We will postpone the 2X upgrade by 6 month or more. We will have post segwit data, and we can develop a better upgrade proposal that we can all get on board with. But only if we stop the smear campaign and start communicating.

Cool summary. Also, remember that for the global level adoption, we need both blocksize increase and high capacity second layers, because you need to open and close channels on bitcoin on chain. Ideally the blocksize would increase with adoption at a slow rate automatically (not a single 2x) to support high capacity second layer networks like Lightning and Rootstock, etc.

Can you tell if there is less spam or is the empty mempool caused by a huge amount of blocks created on the bitcoin chain? The last hours show 10-11 blocks per hour instead of the normal 6. But generally I agree with you.

This was a narrative for the longest time by big blockers. However I don’t think it’s true. Big blocks do bring fees down, but they don’t make transactions instantly confirmed, and they inflate the base block chain to levels that prevent most people from running full nodes, which reduces the core value of Bitcoin, it’s decentralized nature. LN solves all 3 issues, and does even better than that. It incentivizes running full nodes and collecting fees. Suddenly, buying Bitcoin is not just a passive investment, but a way to open channels and generate money by collecting LN fees. In result in the near future there will be more demand for BTC from LN node operators, thus LN will be indirectly responsible for increasing the value of each BTC and subsequently increasing the security of Bitcoin on the first layer too by incentivizing miners. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:45:32
Yeah. It’s really unfortunate that Bitpay is still using legacy addresses. They and their customers would benefit greatly from upgrading to segwit addresses. They should already be implementing Lightning Network invoices. Bitrefill has had both Segwit and LN invoices for quite some time and works perfectly. There are no technical barriers just lack of will. 
Bitpay seem to be intentionally neglecting Bitcoin because I speculate they want to increase the relative utility of BCH making Bitcoin transactions look more expensive. With segwit and LN they wouldn’t be.
Bitmain has ownership in Bitpay, so they can influence what Bitpay is doing or not doing in this case. Bitmain is interested to keep the BCH price from falling because they have like 1M BCH, even if this means they have to stick it to BTC.

You misunderstood my comment. Nobody said you store all your money in paper notes or you have a problem taking money out of ATMs.
The use case I'm talking about is different: "For example if I had to pay somebody a small debt... w/ paper notes..." In short I'm saying: Bitcoin is better than some of the small currencies represented as paper notes. (Maybe HUF is a bad example, pick a more obscure one.)
Try paying a friend in the San Francisco or in Bangkok for your share of lunch with Albanian Leks and see if they are more likely to accept monopoly money (in their eyes) or Bitcoins (also smiled at) on their phone. I don't have research but I bet more will take Bitcoins if they had the option.
Btw, you're not sending HUF around the world, but USD converted by your bank for a fee when you send it. Same applies when you take money out from the ATM or buy something with your credit card. You're instantly selling your HUF for other currencies. People take your USD you bought for your HUF, not your HUF.

Bitcoin doesn't need to become a major currency to be successful. If it covers 0.1-1% of worldwide transactions we can consider it a success. Also, every person can define success in a different way. In a technical sense it's already a success. It's one of a kind already.

Yes, maybe there are still more HUF accepting people. Aside from the 10M Hungarians, maybe another 50M would accept it globally. 
Compared to maybe 1-2M active Bitcoin users. But the potential for Bitcoin users is bigger. None of my contacts refused Bitcoin regardless of age or country so far as a form of payment even if they were not Bitcoin users. So I think the potential users are in the hundreds of millions.
Maybe HUF isn't a good example yet, but the number of HUF users is dropping while BTC users is increasing. 
And, I'm sure there are many small currencies who have less than a million native users. In those cases Bitcoin is already more useful.

You're right about the breaking changes part.
Rootstock still has a benefit of being a sidechain to Bitcoin, which is the most used and recognized crypto in the world. If you were to start a business now and had to pick a platform for smart contracts, you would probably be in a better position to run it on Rootstock, because you would benefit from the large Bitcoin user base, and it is not as busy as Ethereum, so you can get away with lower fees.
Another reason for excitement is it can bring off-chain scaling potentially to Bitcoin. You can imagine a wallet where BTC is your savings account and SBTC (Rootstock Smart Bitcoin or RSK) is your spending account. You can switch between the two at any time, and you would using your SBTC for daily payments including various smart contract payments, but you store the majority of your BTC in BTC main chain because it is the safest.
In the future we may have wallets that support multiple "sidechains" including SBTC, Lightning BTC, and maybe Mimble Wimble BTC, besides the on-chain BTC coins. Thus, you could spend your BTC in any way you want to with the merchants depending on what they accept.
* Large payments: BTC
* Streaming content / Coffee: LBTC

How would that multi-sig work in the last paragraph exactly? Is this description below correct?
There is a 3 of 3 multisig wallet. 2 keys are with the buyer. 1 keys is with the seller.
1. Buyer signs the 1st key on purchase.
2. Seller sends the shipment and signs the 2nd key.
3. Once the shipment arrives the buyer signs the 3rd key.
4. Transactions goes through from buyer to seller.
If at 2. the seller doesn't send the shipment, the buyer won't sign the third key thus the money gets returned after some time to the the buyer automatically. This is cool and it gives protection for the buyer.
But, what happens if the seller does send the shipment and the buyer doesn't sign the third key when the shipment arrives? The seller can't do anything about this as he only has one of the three keys and only two are signed so far. This multisig setup doesn't protect the seller from buyer fraud.
Or is the multisig set-up in a way, that the transaction never times out and thus if the seller doesn't sign the buyer can't get his money back? Thus if the two parties do not cooperate the funds will just sit in a limbo forever?
Perhaps there is a need for a 4th key given to a lawyer or some third party who can release the funds to either the seller or the buyer if there is a dispute to whoever the third party thinks deserves it?

Yes, the title is misleading. He intends to create a closed loop, but at this point it's only one player who is willing to play ball. But this is how it starts. We need 1,000 such willing people to get 10 who can find at least one party to trade with, and out of those 10 there will be one that can truly create a closed loop. And that closed loop will eventually bring in more and more players who will eventually connect to other partially complete loops. Etc.

Maybe he wants to test what happens if he gets very well connected and then suddenly closes his channels unilaterally down forcing others do the same too to not lose their funds. Maybe he is planning to do this at a time when the bitcoin network is busy anyway or under a transaction spam attack. Maybe the idea is that fees go so high, over $10 that it will not be worth it to send punishing on-chain transactions to save small $10 or less LN funds. Thus overall he could profit in generating more bitcoin and create panic within the BTC community around LN to push an alt.

Sorry. I think you didn't understand the main promise. Let me give you an example. 
For simplicity's sake I will use round numbers.
1MB allows for 0.1% of users running nodes
1M users
1K nodes
Increase 1MB to 2MB:
2MB only allows for 0.08% of users running nodes
2MB accommodates 2M users
1.6K nodes
Increase to 8MB:
0.03% - drastic drop
8M users
2.4 nodes
Thus we have more users and more nodes even if the percentage of node running users dropped. The bigger the block the more decentralized and secure bitcoin is.
We of course don't know how much the percentages will drop, but it's unlikely that more than half the nodes will stop because 2MB blocks are introduced. Likely only a minority will be affected. 
On another note, nodes dropping for the last few years can be attributed to many things and surely not to the block increase, which has not happened. One of the reasons is convenient wallets like Copay that do not need the download of the whole blockchain.
Also consider that it's likely that with a growing bitcoin user base, we will have more corporate players the like of Walmart, who will run several full nodes for their own protection and for speedy processing of their own payments.

How can Jorge Stolfi say that Bitcoin doesn't provide a service of value to society? It provides a payment system and an independent and incorruptible currency for the internet and the unbanked, and provides a universal ledger for hundreds of uses we haven't even fully explored.
Bitcoin provides the oil that the internet and the developing world needs to function efficiently. Amazing savings. Amazing new businesses.
It doesn't compare to ponzi or penny stock at all. 
Even the investment feature of Bitcoin is infinitely more valuable than penny because of the international, decentralized and independent nature of it. In investment diversification is key and any asset that is very different from all else is of greatest value.

Can't blame him. The Bitcoin blockchain is already full. Even if we wanted it to be used as a settlement layer we need a larger block or even better a more frequent block, like LTC for example. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:16:57
Do you think BTC can replace or complement signifacantly gold as international store of value with 250K / day transaction limit? No. It would mean every person could only do one transaction in their entire lifetime in average. And LN won't change this either, because you need at least two transactions on-chain to open and close an LN channel. The Bitcoin capacity on chain needs to grow at least to 10MB per block and we need LN and other off-chain solutions as well. If this doesn't happen, Bitcoin remain a fun play money for a few, while other cryptos will take all uses of Bitcoin including store of value over time. Many understand this and this is why alt with potential high capacity have grown to be valued near $10. If the Bitcoin cap was 10MB we would have a market cap of Bitcoin several times higher than Today.
But hey, maybe this is a good thing. Maybe we need many parallel cryptos to run the world and the slow growth of Bitcoin eventually will benefit the world by giving a chance to other currencies to grow and mature.

To use LN you need to at least open once, and then close the channel. So instead of a regular one on-chain transaction, at minimum you need two on chain transactions and one LN transaction. Thus, it only frees up on-chain capacity if you make at least 3 LN transactions before closing.
Currently most of the transactions on Bitcoin are single events. Somebody paying somebody else for a service or product, or depositing or getting coins from an exhange.
It's unlikely you want to lock up such funds for 6 month in the hopes that maybe you will do a similar transaction later that LNcan optimize. So in these cases LN won't reduce the on-chain transactions. Maybe even increase them. 
Bur there are many regular payments between companies and miners that will over time save on-chain capacity. 
It's hard to tell how it will fold out. I think LN will help over time a lot giving huge capacity overall.

We shouldn't automatically assume it's a spam attack anymore.
Personally, I noticed increased interest in Bitcoin, in the last few weeks, among people and businesses I know who didn't care about BTC at all in the past. They are asking about how to use Bitcoin as a payment system, and as a hedge against possible negative political and economic events. It's likely bunch of people entering the ecosystem, which is supported by the fact that price has been on a steady slow incline. All these transactions could be legitimate organic growth.
If we were to enter a new bubble and volume were to rise 2-3-4x on exchanges, the number of transactions in the mempool will grow to the 100K+ range, and you would have to shell out $10 to to move $100. PayPal would suddenly look cheap in comparison.
On the "upside", these events will keep all these newcomers and traders away and stabilize things. Having no other choice, people will start to use other Blockchains for their immediate needs relieving the pressure on the Bitcoin network.
It would be interesting if people started trading Bitcoin on top of Ethereum as a token, because moving Bitcoins directly would be too expensive and slow. :)

If only a few million people can use bitcoin for gold 2.0 purposes it won't ever become gold 2.0. The reason gold can be a store of value is because it is accepted by billions who can actually buy and sell it on will. 
If there is a will to buy and sell bitcoin by millions every day, but there is no means to transfer it they will not be able complete the transaction thus the sale won't happen. Bitcoin will still retain value but not as much as it could have if there was no arbitrary limit to its velocity.

So in your mind it can never be full, even if the transaction fee is higher than the transferred value? :) Doesn't this make the value transfer system unusable or the very least grossly inefficient?
Also, do you consider all second layer apps spam? LN channel opening and closing spam too?
Regardless how you see Bitcoin's purpose or future it can never be more than play money if the total max number of transactions it can do at any fee rate is around 250K per day. That's like 1 transaction per person per lifetime (!) if Bitcoin were to became globally relevant tech like email or telephony. Surely that won't do, don't you agree?

I think it's not much. The number of transactions submitted by legitimate non-spam users already almost filling up available block space. A spam attack is getting less and less expensive over time. This is why we see congestion more often nowadays. Soon it will be the permanent state of Bitcoin.
Now $250 per day will buy you 10% of the block capacity pushing the network over limits. As fees increase to compete with your spam, you would have to increase your daily spending to $500 or more. At this point you're constantly increasing the mempool and increasing the fees.
With $1,000 / day you could force people to pay up to 50 cents a transactions on average and several dollars for a guaranteed first block.
If you had really deep pockets, you could push the network over the edge by spending $10K per week.
In practice you would not need to spend even this much, you can stop spending whenever the network is naturally growing the mempool for some reason, or if another spammer joins the attack. It's likely there are at least a few attackers available to spend some money at any moment.
I could be wrong with my estimates.
It's no use blaming spammers for our problems. Every system is constantly under attack and it's part of doing business. We have to have a Bitcoin that can deal with it. I don't know how... The simple solution is to raise the block limit over the demand sufficiently that spam attacks become too expensive. For example at 2MB you would have to spend $25K / day to create the same congestion. There are few players who have that kind of money and it would just fuel miner earnings, without much disruption to the network.

It could be decreased but it comes with a price. It increases orphans. ETH does 15 seconds, but they had to include special things in order to redistribute the mining reward among nodes that have orphan blocks.
Also, it's hard to 51% attack a chain if you have to hold hashpower for a longer time. It's much easier to buy and hold 51% for a few minutes, than hours, in order to reverse transactions. So 10 minutes keeps the chain safer.

By your logic in which correlation is causation, we can also conclude that with a steady blocksize the nodes are dropping. The argument would be that Bitcoin gone stale, so people are losing interest. :)
Also, you're cherry picking your data. In reality node count went from zero to thousands as the user base grew. The drop is because the user base couldn't grow further because of the block size limit and because of new wallet technology that doesn't require full nodes anymore.

Dollars or gold are equally worthless as Bitcoin if there is no demand. What creates demand for any money is its utility above all. Utility comes from scarcity, fungibility, acceptance, and ability to transfer and store it efficiently.
Bitcoin is stronger than old fiat and gold in some of these areas, and weaker in other areas. You can never improve gold its weaknesses: you can never send gold over the internet. You can also can't turn government controlled currencies into international decentralized ones without losing their main properties. Bitcoin however can become more widely accepted and thus improve in its properties that it currently lacks against gold and old fiat.
But Hugo of course can't say this, as he's invested in both old fiat and gold and the infrastructure around these moneys.

If you do this you will provide liquidity to markets, which is good. But it's dangerous because you will instantly lose the spread and the cost of trading which can be a percent or more. Also you are risking your funds on an exchange for a while. The plan may not work out and you may need to wait weeks or months to buy back which can be stressful. It is also possible the price will never come down ever in the future.

Lots of people are buying btc with fiat in order to buy alts to keep for long term. Most alts in most places can't be bought directly. They have to go through BTC, generating demand for BTC.
After generating 5-10x returns on alts in the last few months, many other alt traders are cashing out to BTC thinking it's more stable than the alts in bubble. They don't want to get out of crypto entirely, but want to reduce risk. This also generates demand for BTC. 
Another group of people relaized that there are multiple scaling solutions competing for dominance within the Bitcoin ecosystem. They are taking the chance to get in early before the solution has been clarified. Even though the price is slowly rising, there is a proverbial civil war blood on the streets. This is a buy signal for the smart money.
People are learning about the scaling issues and possible solutions from the media. For example there was a great article in New Scientist this week, mentioning segwit and LN.
Finally, less people want to sell now, no matter at which level they bought in. The profits are too low to cash out, and there is a promise for BTC to go beyond 2K within reasonable time. Once we reach that magic number we will see more sellers, but we will see more media hype too.

You have to be fair and admit the Apple Pay did improve credit card payments by consolidating trust to one company Apple, instead of thousands people use. It certainly reduces the risks because Apple can't afford to rob you of a few hundred dollars, when the small shop you bought a shirt from in South-East Asia can.

If you're a long term holder (5 years+) the price doesn't matter until the day you want to buy something. Until that day, it can go up or down and it doesn't really matter.
If you're a short term user moving relatively small amount of value, price doesn't matter either, because you just use Bitcoins temporarily for the transfer, and you don't care how many coins you needed for the transaction. Bitcoin works equally well at any price.
For most of the audience here the growth of the ecosystem, new ideas and use cases, and improvements to the code are the exciting stories. The price only matters within this mindset for one reason: the higher the price the more value can be moved with the coins in circulation, which makes Bitcoin in general more useful for large businesses and high net worth individuals.
If you're a trader, the price is the only thing that matters, but they have their own subreddit.

The argument about keeping blocksize small in order to allow more people to be able to run nodes assumes that if we had twice as many users and Bitcoin enthusiasts / businesses, the number of individuals willing to run would remain the same. This is obviously flawed.
I don't know how much percentage the node count will drop by increasing the limit to 2MB among the folks running nodes at the moment. But there will certainly be some growth of nodes coming from the new folks who are new Bitcoin users. The two effects may balance each other out, and thus we will have a more important and useful bitcoin with the same decentralization. Or it can go down or up. I think nobody can tell with certainty that it will go down, it's just an assumption. 
One thing is certain, the net speeds and package caps are growing. The prices of net packages and hardware are falling. The risks of losing decentralization is decreasing every single day. Thus the argument loses ground as time goes by as well. 
Certain alts have more nodes than Bitcoin, and they have a larger potential transaction per second capacity at the same time. They will take the use cases Bitcoin could fill with larger blocks eventually. 
Also, there is a double standard here. If raising the block size limit to 2MB is too risky, how come it's OK to do it up to 4MB with segwit? You can't have the cake and eat it too. 
Correct me if my logic is flawed, or my information is incorrect. 
Having said that I support segwit. I'm not a BU fanboy.

@_date: 2016-10-26 23:03:14
So you are saying by keeping the blocksize we can ensure Bitcoin stays small and insignificant enough for any governement to worry about it? ;)
On a serious note you have to think one step further.
If you raise the block size, you will allow more people into the ecosystem and thus you have more chance of people setting up nodes and contribute to bitcoin security is various ways. The amount of security you lose because of higher bandwidth and storage needs will be compensated by the overall larger user base, and more.
If you want bitcoin to be more decentralized and attack resistant you should support a larger block size, which allows bitcoin to become bigger and more robust in every way.
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:44:21
Yes, arbitrary, and we don't know how much the percentage of people willing to run a node will drop. My numbers were just an example to explain the concept that there is a possible dynamic that counteracts the percentage drop and will likely lead to the opposite event to what one may expect to happen to node count.
Games are nowadays 500GB easily, and people download them daily on their XBOX and PS4. Several TB / month should not be a challenge with high bandwidth internet connections especially if it's spread out evenly over time (which is the case).
Those who have bandwidth caps or slow internet won't run nodes anyway regardless of the block size. You may be part of that unfortunate few who will be forced stop running a node because the blocksize increase puts you over the bandwidth or drive size you're willing to pay for. But others who with increased Bitcoin adoption will now have an incentive to run nodes (like businesses) will step in to help out.
I realize we can't know which way it will go for sure. But if you argue based on not having enough data or certainty of what will happen, then your own argument that node count will drop is equally baseless, and equally just speculation.
What we're assessing is the likelihood of various outcomes. As long the drop is above 50% we're winning in absolute number of nodes. My guess the drop will be not more than 20%, thus increasing the block size is likely a win for security.
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:15:59

Yes, the point is a well known statistical fact. Neither the commenter or me discovered it.

This is cool, but I think the description over-promises at the moment: "The Hodl Index - is a Bitcoin sentiment index, which shows Bitcoin price expectations based on the number of different kinds of news. "
Right now it only shows the number of news categorized by the 3 criteria. It doesn't show Bitcoin price expectations.
There should be another line which with some formula summarizes the data for a bullish or bearish prediction. This is of course very hard. Simply comparing the number of good and bad news and deciding based on it would be incorrect. Perhaps the way to decide would be to track the amount of change. 
For example if typically there are 5 good news per day and 2 bad news, and on a given day the good news is still 5 and the bad news goes to 4, it may be an indication of a bear, even though good is higher than bad. This is because the good news rate didn't change, but the bad news rate doubled.
This is of course a very simplistic algo, you could make it much smarter. You could use a learning algorithm that learns based on actual market movement feedback, and gets better and better over time. A learner would be great because it would learn manipulation attempt patterns too, and outsmart the actors with correct predictions that go against common sense.
The funny thing is, if you can crack the formula, make it public, and lots of people start following your site, the success will destroy the formula, because people will anticipate other people's actions and thus act the opposite way or totally unpredictably. Then, readership will drop and thus predictions would become more precise because there are less people paying attention to it. Because of such constant feedback loop, the algo eventually will even out and give you no better prediction than a random advice.
The only way this can work if you don't make the prediction public, and only give access to a selected few dozen small to medium size traders. Maybe charge for the advice based on how correct the advice is. For example if it's correct 55% of the time you charge $5, if it's correct 80% of the time you charge $30. If it drops below 50%, you give credit to be spent on using the service for times when the learner gets smarter.

But just for the sake of exploring the thinking here. You're basing you opinion of my correctness on one (!) sample prediction which only held correct for a short amount of time. Isn't one too small a sample? Maybe if I was wrong 9 out of 10 times it would be reasonable to say I'm full of shit, but after one isn't it a bit harsh? You have very high standards! :)
When the weather man says there is only a 10% chance of rain, he's not wrong if it does rain. He would only be wrong if there were 100 days when he gave a 10% chance for rain and it rained 30 times.
Also, I'm not trying to pump the price because I'm invested. I have less than $50 worth of bitcoins which I use to tip and show friends how it works.
I'm optimistic because I'm old enough, and I always had the chance to see the potential of the web and other technologies before the majority of others, just like I see the potential of Bitcoin now. I feel I could be off by a few years here and there, but the in general trends will likely fold out as I imagine.

They will probably try to build a private blockchain, but if it's not mined, or significantly decentralized, I don't know how secure it is or what value it brings.
Banks are part of larger groups, so they could easily manipulate such a private blockchain by colluding.
Swift should really use Bitcoin and become a significant miner and node itself. Banks should all be miners and nodes too. This would create a highly secure and incorruptible Bitcoin that is perfect for Swift's purposes. They could use colored coins to move dollars and thus don't need to worry about BTC's volatility.

Actually wealth used to be concentrated in the hands of a much more shockingly small number of people. It used to be a handful of kings. Now we have literally millions of millionaires. Things are getting better in this regard even without Bitcoin.
Also, Bitcoin distribution follows a similar pattern as old money distribution. A shockingly small amount of individuals control a very large portion of all bitcoins. Not complaining, just a fact. ;)

The good thing is that this chunk of bitcoins will now land in long hands at close to market prices as opposed to the government who wants to get rid of them which adds to the uncertainty in the market. The new owners are probably well off and aren't putting all their money into BTC. They are buying to diversify their investments. They will keep the Bitcoin as hedge in case other more traditional investments fail. So, they won't be forced to sell if the price goes down. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:07:17
With all but Bitcoin, you're essentially giving away your private keys and trust companies and merchants to keep the information safe from themselves and thieves. Since they can't keep it safe (as their track record continuously demonstrates) you also have to pay for relatively high insurance costs through the credit card fees. Essentially, we're funding the fraudsters.
Bitcoin is the only one that deserves a green security status as it uses fundamentally new and safe asymmetric cryptography, so you don't have trust your private keys to any third party. A thief can't do anything with your stolen payment information between you and the merchant. In fact it's so safe all transactions are completely public. You can see then live here in full detail: 
Also, the Bitcoin security concerns mentioned in the table are not security issues. They are customer service issues, and they can be addressed if you entrust a Bitcoin company like Coinbase who will manage your Bitcoins, like any other bank. But, you really don't need to, because the default security of Bitcoin removes the need for insurance and customer service in the first place.

We will need more decimals long before 1 satoshi is $1, since we need to be able to pay miner fees in BTC. As soon as 1BTC costs around $100,000 we need more decimals.
Btw, lots of virtually worthless coins like doge already have a decimal issue when traded against BTC, because 1 BTC equals something between 0.00000010 to 0.00000100 BTC, so the smallest jump between prices is about one full percent. You can't trade by a fraction of a percent against BTC anymore. If the spread between doge and BTC gets wider it will not be possible to trade in satoshis anymore. Exchanges would have to simulate one tenth or one hundreds of a satoshi, or drop such coins.

I have to agree. Asicboost is only a problem if it centralizes mining. However it's not a secret technology, and is available to other entities building miners, thus it's not an advantage on the long term, and won't centralize mining.
Also, what kind of precedent does blocking covert asicboost create for the future? If bitfury tomorrow comes up with a novel way to create 10x more efficient miners, will we start another BIP to block them out, because of the risk of them centralizing mining?
Finally, are we saying POW is obsolete, because significant node operators (exchanges, payment processors, etc.) control what the code is? I guess it's fine if that's the case, but then why not switch to POS, so we don't need to waste all the power?
I'm not trying to attack, just trying to wrap my head around the arguments, which don't seem to be logical at times.

It's the price of security.
You can get security two ways:
1. Centralize and secure it with guns. You make the risk of losing your freedom too high, thus you remove the incentive for a robbery. Cost to the system: centralized central and local bank servers, buildings, staff; police; judicial system; jails; etc.
2. Decentralize. You make the cost of a robbery too high way above the amount you can win, thus you remove the incentive to do it. Cost: mining.
Which one do you think is significantly lower?

Even if he did all this, one could still find dozens of other ways to trick him. There is never going to be an absolute undeniable proof for Satoshi's identity. As an extreme example, even if Craig W. moved the genesis block with a message saying "Satoshi is Craig W." people could still say that he hacked the real Satoshi, or he bought the private key from him.
Retrospectively it's easy to come up with a list of things Gavin could've done to increase certainty, but almost none of us would've done such a thorough procedure in Gavin's place. Also, Gavin doesn't owe anybody anything. He went, he watched, he reported. You don't have to believe, he's not forcing you to believe. He's just one puzzle piece that you can take or leave.
Regardless, all this is fun. But, let's not lose focus from the real job and the goals of Bitcoin. It's irrelevant who Satoshi is now.

So, if only 0.01% (an incredibly low estimate) of the 6 trillion moves into bitcoin we're talking about 600 million dollars. On Today's prices that's 2.4M BTC. There isn't that much bitcoin on sale on all exchanges in total. Even if this money trickled into bitcoin over 2 years we're still talking about a market buying up 100K BTC / month. This would easily suck up all the new bitcoins mined and more. Especially if we consider this is in addition to the market bitcoin already has Today.
Perhaps this is what the investors buying up 30K-50K auctioned BTCs were counting on.
If this happens, we have surely found the bottom price Today. People hoping for sub $100 BTC to buy in may never have the chance.
What excites me about all this is the attention the price will bring to Bitcoin, and consequently all the talent.

I think it's incredibly hard to tell where the price goes next. The environment and the effects on price are totally different from early years.
**Chance of Bitcoin collapsing: 10%**
It's unlikely that we will see Bitcoin collapse to $10 in the next two decades. Most people won't sell or spend at those low prices even if they lost hope, unless they are starving and need the money. There isn't enough available coins on the market to push prices that low even in a very grave situation, like governments banning bitcoin and bitcoin having a massive code fail. Investors will always speculate that this is temporary setback and will buy up at low prices and it would be a rational thing to do. I know I would.
**Chance of Bitcoin being close to saturation point: 25%**
It's possible we are "close" to a saturation point in terms of usage. Bitcoin may never reach tens of millions of users. We may only see a small increase in price generated by current users increasing their bitcoin investments and some new users. In this scenario innovation will be slow, but still happen and the price will always remain in the hundreds.
**Chance of aggressive growth: 55%**
It's also possible and likely in my opinion that the new hardware and software solutions currently in the works or on the table as ideas, will make Bitcoin significantly easier to use in the next couple of years. This will open up the market for significantly more users pushing the price up into the 2K-5K range. As soon as we see a recovery to $700-800 ranges we will see a massive rally as the worries of bitcoin being "dead" will dissipate and lots of people will want to jump on the bandwagon to make a quick buck.
**Chance of Bitcoin taking over the World: 10%**
In my opinion Bitcoin won't take over the existing financial system and reach a price of million dollars per coin within the next 2 decades. Bitcoin will live alongside the old currencies as an alternative smaller free brother. Its innovations however will influence changes in the traditional financial world and will consequently benefit us all with more transparency, lower costs, faster transaction times, etc.

If you get 95% consensus on a protocol change it would mean the change is supported by most users. In your example, it's possible Bitcoin users would benefit from a perpetual fixed inflation rate that is in line with the average growth of GDP, like economists argue for inflation Today.

By taking into consideration the number of bitcoins transacted at each price point, WinkDex allows for larger transactions to be given more weight than smaller transactions, reflecting the value of each transacted bitcoin from the underlying exchanges.
By including 2 hours of data (in contrast to just the last transaction), WinkDex lowers the risk of outlier transactions disproportionately impacting the WinkDex value.

Thank you!
We have ants in the apartment, and we don't kill them. I observed them, and had the idea a few month ago that their route finding could potentially be explored for LN. And here we're. :)
The real ant algo is indeed efficient at finding food and coordinating large number of ants, and they do exhibit an emergent intelligence that is beyond a single ant.
The path is far from optimal initially. Sometimes they take really long convoluted routes to get to the food and transport it back to the hive. If the food source runs out within a day, the amount of time and energy spent finding alternate routes is probably not worth it. However, if the food source is abundant and lasts several days, the route starts to become more optimal. The path become straighter, and they find occasional shortcuts too.
The same strategy could be applied to LN payment streaming. If you're only paying once, you just want to find a route, of really any kind no matter the cost within a reasonable limit. However, if you're streaming payments every minute or so, you may want to try to explore new routes occasionally to see if network conditions allow a cheaper and faster route with less hops.

I think it's reasonable to put 1-5% of your savings into Bitcoin. If it goes 10x-100x in 2 years as it did in the past years you will increase your savings by 10-500%. If it goes bust you only lost 1-5%.

I don’t think Bitcoin will lose the currency feature either. LN already works as well or better than alts. The acceptance is growing fast. Try Bitrefill for example. Alts are nothing but a high stake casino at this point. Not a bad business proposition but not currency by any means. Poker chips.

According to ACI Worldwide half of Americans were victims of credit card fraud within just the last 5 years.
The other half doesn't read their statements. ��
Joking aside, if you take this stat and extrapolate to more years, virtually everybody experienced security issues with their credit card, and most people have had it multiple times.
I don't have Bitcoin stats, but I bet the fraud related to compromised wallets is much-much smaller.
Let's not count exchange hacks as a Bitcoin issue, because we didn't count bank hacks either. If we did Bitcoin would probably still come out on top. Banks reported 1,818 breaches in a single year between mid 2015 and mid 2016. Even if the victims were compensated (or they didn't even realise their money was stolen), they will pay for the thefts indirectly through inflation and fees, because that money has to come out of somewhere.
Also, before 'but you don't lose money with credit cards' argument comes up: approximately 65% of the time, credit card fraud resulted in a direct or indirect financial loss for the victim, with an average reported loss of $1,343 in 2014. Today the numbers are much worse, because the problem is growing every year.

Nobody knows if he left his private keys to anyone, but it's likely he didn't, because at the time they didn't seem like something worth keeping. Would you ensure to leave private keys to a million doge Today? Most people would forget or not bother? (And now we have the benefit of hindsight that it could potentially be valuable.)
This happened to lot of people and their traditional valuables hidden in safes and underground. Death comes sudden and unexpected even when you're ill.
I hope this is not true. He should be enjoying the fruit of his labour.

Not exactly. Because the transactions are bigger, the liquid chain can only carry as many transactions as Bitcoin, but still it means the "Bitcoin network" capacity has doubled and Liquid confirms in seconds.
So far not many transactions are on the Liquid network: [

Bald guy is [Kevin O'Leary]( he was on shark tank. He's not an idiot by any measure, but he completely misunderstands what the benefit of Bitcoin is. He gets the idea of digital gold, but fails to take the idea further in his head. It's like gold indeed, because it's borderless and independent of a specific state, but much better because it's designed for the internet and information age and thus can be transferred easily across continents in minutes (or even seconds in case of LN). He is so invested in the idea of fiat being the only real money, that he can't wrap his head around the fact that a new type of money can just come about and people would accept it as money, and some consider it even better money than fiat. He doesn't connect the concept of Bitcoin halving with the fact that gold mining is also becoming harder with time, which is why gold can be a store of value.

Those are true points. What we need is for all wallets, and merchants to support LBTC, so we can do do transactions on this sidechain.

Incorrect. The data shows the difficulty will increase slightly in 2 days, which means we didn't lose hashing power.

That's interesting, but he's not exactly trying to make bitcoin less valuable. He's fighting against the notion of digital scarcity being a value of bitcoin. I think he's wrong, and didn't provide any reason why, but we should also realize that people change their opinions quickly on these subjects. We should ask what he thinks now.

The media industry, telecoms, superstores are what the internet turned upside down. And just like the internet didn't put an end to the telecom just added alternatives, Bitcoin won't destroy the current financial system, just provide a solid alternative.

You can't just use SEPA to send funds to anyone in the world without having a paid bank account. For a money order, or wire transfer, or western union transfer you would've paid at least $10-20 in fees.

The problem with XRP is they you hold XRP. With Liquid at least you are holding Bitcoin.

Yeah, double standard, eh?.. :) But I think allowing it all now IS the right thing to do. The removals earlier were incorrect in my opinion, even if they were ETH related. The learnings from other cryptos are all VERY relevant to BTC. However, I respect whatever the mods want to do.

Can someone explain what would be the typical workflow for an average person if he were to receive lightning payment from his employer, and pay his rent to his landlord, and pay for groceries at the store with lightning too? Who will open the channels?
Also, do I understand it correctly that when using lightning you're not sharing your public key with the person paying you anymore (like you do with onchain bitcoin transactions)? You're just sending them an invoice in form of that string Anton copy pasted?

The dynamics that prevent Bitcoin to be upgraded in any way also protect the rules of bitcoin creation.
If changes were easy we would have medium articles written about the worry that one day the 21M cap would be removed, reducing investor confidence in Bitcoin. 
However we should be aware of the Stockholm syndrome effect. Hostages tend to explain away the situation to retain sanity.

1. Price is still very high. 1BTC is 200+x more valuable than a dollar that has been around for centuries.
2. Mining is designed to be barely profitable. It's not a problem, it's a feature.
3. Dollar itself has no protection either. It's the institutions around it that gives it a safety net. And people can do the same with Bitcoins Today. There are companies who will ensure your Bitcoins or even the value of your coins. And in the future the ecosystem will only grow further.
4. Merchants will not have to adopt a new payment system. Events like PayPal and Stripe incorporating Bitcoin means they don't have to do anything, but check a checkbox that they are willing to take Bitcoin. Another non-issue.
5. "Bitcoin is a passing trend" is not a reason, but a summation, which is based on the previously mentioned false arguments.
The writer has a poor understanding of the Bitcoin ecosystem and how to argue in general.
There are legitimate concerns around Bitcoin, but these "reasons" are not it. :)

This video proves that the price is not predictable based on technicals. At 6,400 he said it's extremely overbought: don't buy. A day later the price is a 1,000 dollars higher, therefore as a trader you just missed out on making a ton of money in a short amount of time.

Exactly right. LN is fantastic, but it needs both segwit and larger blocks to be able to serve a significant percentage of worldwide transactions. Especially when we consider that the biggest use will be machine to machine payments. Not humans.

The only problem is that there is a gap between selling and buying your bitcoin and you would be paying that difference with every purchase effectively increasing your 10 USD to 10.3USD roughly if my thinking is correct.
