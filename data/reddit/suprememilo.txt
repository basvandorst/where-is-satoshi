  What are you talking about?  Blocks are full at 1MB.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:10:18
You do realize that you need an on chain transaction to open a lightning channel, and that on chain transactions have hit $30 and many people in the world live on $1 a day?

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Bitcoin is currently not this.  It is currently digital gold.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:58:48
Except the fact that it will take many people's in the world one month's salary to open a lightning channel.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:36:43
How do you prepay a channel closure?  What if the fee to do an onchain transaction increases to the point where your “prepay” transaction doesn’t have enough fee to be included in a block?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:10:38
I have a contribution, go change a one to an eight.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:03:18
Just wait until you realize what we can do with big blocks, and second and third layer applications.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:01
1MB blocksize limit is why.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:03
Where can I sell some of this $15,000 bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 03:11:41
We all lost out BTC when coreshills decided to that Bitcoin was no longer an inexpensive peer to peer currency.

While I hate paypal as much as the next guy, they probably don't want to deal with chargebacks when the buyers realize what they have bought isn't profitable.

Interesting stuff is going to happen when the Neptunes and other next gen devices start shipping.

This comment needs to be highly visible.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:59:45
Should we be filing FOIA requests for any government agency that has maybe had any contact with Gox?
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:38:39
Just got 1.5 BTC out of Coinbase I had in there
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:54:35
Peer to centralized hub to peer is not peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:53:06
This is the sub that thinks full nodes secure the network.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:49:20
Setting up a channel will be so expensive, that you won't be able to make on chain transactions, and be forced to use a LN channel for everything, and a few large players will emerge and control most Bitcoin transactions...
All scaling MUST include reasonably priced on chain transactions, or it is no longer Bitcoin.

Get to stop being a piece of shit and the community will become much more united.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:57:34
It will still be "Bitcoin" but it will be a long way away from a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:35:14
Does that technical discussion include being allowed to talk about a block size increase?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:26:23
Why would that be sarcasm?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:18:35
If someone rebroadcasts your transmission, it would be annoying, but you would own the keys.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:10:11
And you own the private keys there too..:
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:32:41
This is a straight up FUD post attacking the protocol upgrade...
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:02:06
If fees weren’t high, we wouldn’t even need replay protection, you could move all the coins you aren’t going to use to a new address before yoI send on the other chain....
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:25:08
Core should increase the block size to 8MB+ tomorrow, anyone with a halfway non shit internet connection could handle this and it could tie us over until off chain scaling is proven.
But they won't because they don't want on chain scaling at all.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:34:39
I want a protocol upgrade not a separate chain.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:45:01
If you unload your BTC to a new address before sending your S1X coins they can’t steal your btc
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:37:13
Big blocks is how we stay decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:25:43
And my only agenda is to use Bitcoin as it was intended.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:25:45
We need to united against Blockstream’s total control of bitcoin now.

How did that vast farming knowledge work out for Mao?
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:21:25
How so?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:59:56
Oh, so like a UASF.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:55:46
Cheaper transactions leading to wider adoption?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:34:06
How did that vast farming knowledge work out for the Soviets?
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:39:55
Once we figure out what size cap this can handle, we can calculate the cost for the bandwidth usage in different countries.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:50:11
What is the limiting factor?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:47:56
If you can't pull down 43GB a month then maybe Bitcoin is not for you.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:14:07
Do the math.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:13:43
You can generate your keys deterministicly from the seed.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:33:49
Fees are about a dollar right now to get confirmed in the next block, fantastic when minimum wage is $20 a month...
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:53:21
If someone hands you a private key, you don’t own that key.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:26:44
Why would I pay an extra coupe dollars to buy something off of Amazon...
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:11:49
You wouldn't need this is we had 8MB blocks....  And you could easily still host a node.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:49:07
Jamie Dimon is going to be loving bitcoin when JPM is running centralized lightning nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:45:37
2nd layer is much more comprable to Venmo than 2X.....
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:39:05
A transaction isn't on the blockchain until it is confirmed...
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:31:33
Increase blocksize until second layer is ready.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:36:30
So literally the only technical reason is that 2MB doesn't go far enough...  The only reason the split is dangerous is because people are clinging to 1X....
Replay protection isn't needed as this was intended to replace 1X, and people have plenty of time to upgrade their nodes...
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:03:21
If it is an upgrade, no replay protection is needed....
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:09:55
You put the seed in something like Electrum, use an always offline PC, don't get fucked.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:56:06
Why is replay protection needed if one of the chains is supposed to die?
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:09:51
Bitcoin Core may be Bitcoin, but it isn’t peer to peer electronic cash, which means it isn’t Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:05:14
Lmao, I did not know this, completely refutes the shills on here saying you only need one onchain transactions and you can say get paid in bitcoin and increase your stash.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:27:50
So.... show up to the grocery store at daybreak and hope your transaction is confirmed by sundown so you can go home and feed your family?

I did, got it out a couple years after I mined it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:17:58
I would recommend doing nothing and hodling.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:46:35
You can do offline transactions with electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:58:24
You can sign a transaction offline out it on a USB drive into a computer online with zero chance of compromising your keys.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:13:52
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:08:59
You can get your keys by importing your seed into electrum...
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:39:15
Go buy a USB stick, format it in a different offline only PC, then put it in your Electrum rig.
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:47:46
Collective stupidity like not raising the blocksize and handing everything over to Blockstream?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:59:47
Even though I don't think BCC is going to be a thing long term, I am not sure this strategy fits in with HODLing.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:20:30
I love slush for the soul reason that I used the pool when I mined my .8 BTC back in the day (took three days, stopped mining because my pc was too loud ������)
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:17:56
I would recommend doing nothing and hodling.
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:04:15
Everyone who wants to use it needs a channel.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:09:30
And have to pay TX fees from multiple inputs when they want to spend?????
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:58:38
C:/windows.old/users/(you)/application data/roaming/bitcoin
