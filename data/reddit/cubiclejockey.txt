Primarily with the known blockchain, which is why they won’t use bitcoin. Permissioned blockchain for business is a big deal right now
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:45:12
That did it. Authorization issue. Thanks!

Why does it seem so rushed, like this all happened when the office was in the middle of closing?
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:46:19
Thats a great excuse for doing nothing to help bitcoin. Lets try to find a solution to the problem with apple's control then.
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:26:42
Thanks, I appreciate you.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:15:19
Is this still an issue?
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:48:31
Right, so 70% of Japan isn't that big anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:58:45
with the coinbase app... how do customers tip?
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:37:35
That's creepy as fuck.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:07:26
Can you explain a little bit more on how to implement this?
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:40:10
Anyone in here who wanted to or did buy them years ago... We all know they were for drugs. It's ok. No need to act like an experienced investor in high risk emerging tech markets.

I'm not limiting to the tech crowd, but the iPhone market is highly saturated across the world. excluding that market will prevent adoption worldwide. We need a way to fix that.
Edit: the class I was focusing on with my android comment is the portion of people interested/involved in bitcoin, and the portion of people with android phones. This overlap is an incredibly slim demographic of techy users.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:20:43
How do you do this?

They already have a pos system, and are not honing to switch whole systems and pay thousands of dollars just to take bit coin.

I would love if your reservations support got back to my on my username (3 emails later...) The site just tells me you're holding it. I want my initials!

Unfortunately, merchant adoption is far outpacing customer adoption.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:05:55
What if it then just adds the "paid for" rfidID to a DB of paid for items and allows it through security that way? Similar system to a vending machine, but store sized.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:23:31
so you have to wait there and ask the customer how much they want to tip?
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:57:10
Good to hear. Can't wait to see it in an end user form for the mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:15:15
Can I get my first tip here?
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:54:53
They need someone fulltime on their mobile app / POS system brick and mortar side. All it is currently is a URL service with extremely limited functionality.

**It is a known issue that updating iOS will delete Coin Pocket’s data. You will have to restore from a backup by resetting your device. I recommend moving your funds to a different wallet before updating iOS to avoid having to go through this.**
That's kind of a big deal I'd say. Even a chance of losing my funds would stop me from using this.
Any plans of a merchant side app?
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:34:13
how was the palm scanning and KnowYourCustomer  protection in your opinion? 
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:33:08
or how to buy chips.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:57:11
I hate to be off topic here, but the sound quality, messy desk with lights in the shot, barking dogs and squawking birds during this bit were so distracting I couldn't finish it. 
I enjoy the effort, but slicked back hair, a ladder bookcase, and a tie are not the production value needed here. Find a new shooting location without the echo and outside noise influences and the audience will thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:08:42
Did this and it works flawlessly. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:57:44

Fuck the Federal Government Regulators. I hope they are decimated by Bitcoin and Operation Chokepoint dies.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:46:18
Really... good to know. Anything peculiar about the transaction that made it different than others? about what percent of transactions had a delay or issue?
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:52:54
Sounds like a cost issue for the merchants. This will slow adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:38:29
This is good advice. Coinbase is the most reliable.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:21:31

@_date: 2014-02-15 18:10:26
Can you re explain this like I'm an average craigslist user? Tell me why this is easier.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:57:12
Make sure to keep a copy of the private and public key and tell them there is an expiration so the coins are not lost forever and you can return them to your wallet!

This reporter took advantage of a mentally challenged man who more than likely has delusions of grandeur and paranoia, and filled him into his role as a secret crypto-genius.
The sick part is they do this for profit.

This "guy" Jaron also started  a start up idea for music ticket sales. Jaron talks about security, and yet the security certificate for that site of his is expired. Your browser will probably warn you of this.
Coinsetter on the other hand, claims to be a secure and exclusive exchange in NY, NY and happens to use the same clipart-like icons as Jaron's original project that hasn't been updated since 2012.
TL;DR This guy doesn't care about internet security, just money; be wary of coinsetter exchange
**Edit:** Jaron, thanks for your reply and being professional throughout this thread. The rest of your associates however seem to be bullying, overly defensive, and rude to the majority of the community throughout this thread and really toward anything remotely negative about Coinsetter or you personally. 
While your security practices at Coinsetter may be active and secure, based on the commentary your company seems to attract I'll take my business elsewhere. Good luck with the exchange and like I said below, I do hope that it is as you say and succeeds.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:51:59
Thanks for responding Jaron. Obviously the community as a whole is quite sensitive to security at the moment. More than that, accountability. 
All exchanges, Coinsetter included, will need to prove to be above the amateur level that Gox and others brought to the table. Some have begun and some did it from the outset on one level or another. The community, and I as a user, still need companies like yours to walk the walk before we accept them after the burns of the past. Personally I would like to have Coinsetter succeed and bring more legitimacy to the industry.
Seeing as I found doubt in Coinsetter after a quick google search based on one of the founders past involvement with business, it would seem that it might be a good idea to tie up those loose ends. In regards to ticketometer specifically, putting up a landing page saying as much, removing it entirely, or renewing the cert seem like good options.

ELI5 on how the casino's did it and it can be cross-applied to BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:45:18
Right. Screw the 13% of people and businesses who invested "wrong" Thats a great attitude for adoption. Competition is good, which I assume this sub believes just by the fact that BTC exists, and we need to find ways to make it accessible to EVERYONE.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:58:56
If my tax return ever shows up, I plan on tipping out a portion now. Thanks Bitcoin community for inspiring easy tipping!
