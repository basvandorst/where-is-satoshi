Ha ha, true in so many ways, I stumbled into mining very early when trying to find something to stress test the overclock on my new 5850, at the time I think a bitcoin was worth about 65p
From there it became sort of a hobby and over the following years I mined (and at various points spent) literally thousands of bitcoins, if I'd saved only a tiny percentage I'd be a very rich man right now, but I have no regrets, I had a lot of fun and got to do things I otherwise never would have from it.

Ive been raving about it since it first dropped along with the excellent x11 algo, so I suppose I could be considered a bit of a darkcoin fanboy

 works off your ecg so only you can access your coins, I cant wait to get mine and start developing some other apps for it (the wallet is ready as fr as I hear)

The guy evidently doesnt want to be found whoever he is, I think everyoneshould just leave I as is, I prefer not knowing and its not often I say that
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:39:02
So what of those of us not in the us where there is no tax on btc? But given the initial post im guessing no amount of actual sense would sway opinion so im not going to try
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:07:26
Havent heard of that site, ive been using destinia who also rule, booked two with them already and hopefully a 3rd next month. I didnteven need to give my address just name and passport number
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:41:26
I hate this seemingly supremacist mentality of "you should know already" people seem to forget we were all new at some point and knowledge should be shared, I personally hate the "just google it" or utfse responses as it would probably have taken no more effort to provide the info or a linkthan coming off as a dick.

50btc went scam ages ago
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:44:39
Cant you just keep a jpeg of the qr on your phone? Everyone has their phone with them most the time why would you need one you can reel off the top of your head, do you remember your bank account no or card no? Whilst I actually do most people dont so they carry their card and no one seems to mind that
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:09:01
Check tge bitcoin wiki the 50btc one says in the reward section "kept by pool" I mine at ghash and eclipse these days eclipse has been about a long time and ghash seem like a good pool, that said so did 50btc back in 2012
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:10:02
Pock.io because they do just about anyhing you need, im doing my food shopping today with vouchers off there

How come people are only jumping on this since expedia did it, since destinia did it earlier in the year ive blown nearly my entire btc stash on travel
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:09:07
Im going to guess at it staying between 500 and 530 so lets say 515
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:21:26
Are you in the us? I know on the bundles it usually does accept btc but you can only use it in humble store if youre in the us, something to do with coinbase not operating In the eu, if you access through a vpn you can use btc in the store
@_date: 2014-01-29 10:37:23
If I was in Switzerland I may even get my bust up teeth fixed and I have a paralyzing fear of any dental, btc acceptance would encourage me to get over that (well a bit anyway)

Lossless, lots of it, especially hip hop and electronica
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:43:09
No lets not that sounds a bit clumsy and crappy to me, just my opinion, im no authority but I dont like it
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:39:31
It is I think because they use coinbase who only operate in the us, humble store is the same, not sure why they didnt use bitpay which works globally. In any case usually accessing the site via vpn will allow you to buy in btc or use another site (im sounding like a fanboy with this ive said it so many times but destinia works perfectly for hotels and flights ifyou want an alternative)
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:11:39
Bitcoin probably no unless you have an asic already, scrypt is a different matter though, gpus are still good for that
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:39:07
Stop going on about it, you know what they say any advertising is good advertising as long as they get your name right
other pools could drop their fees making them competetive with the 0 fee at ghash?
Also lots of people keep suggesting p2pool but am I the only one who finds that p2pool has a drastically higher stale/reject rate than stratum by a good way
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:34:19
Thats actually a really good idea I fully agree
@_date: 2014-04-30 17:06:54
Anything with "china" in, im rather fed up of chinese news swinging the price all over the place, china shouldnt ban bitcoin, bitcoin should ban china! (I know that's not actually possible)
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:41:02
Or people could have a little self control and use other pools, there are plenty out there
@_date: 2014-04-15 14:43:39
I had a bad experience too but thankfully one member of their team was helpful when others totally ignored me (irae was the guy who sorted everything out for me)
Im one of those types that doesnt give second chances, eg if a takeaway sends me a bad/wrong meal ill just not go there again so if im honest I now use pock.io gift cards to buy from most places I need
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:45:15
Takeaway.com worked fine for me. If tgere were a pizza express here I could have got a giftcard from pock.io too

People keep suggesting p2pool but personally ive always found p2pool results In a much higher rate of stale shares, not many people want to take a hit in their mining profits so the donations thing may work. call me crazy but maybe one of the other big pools could go fee free, I know theres eligius but its not the nost user friendly site ever, functional but not feature packed or nice to look at

Not sure if they support auz but bitpay has always been awesome for me.
Also im a massive coffee nerd so if it really is good and theyre really shipping globally ill probably try a bag or two eventhough im literally on the other side of the globe
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:36:58
I bet theyre out of cards already arent they dammit
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:40:28
Awesome, that said destinia has been good for me so far so ill likely stick with them as my first port of call
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:03:03
Just think thats almost enough that they could have afforded to pay someone with half a brain to work for them

Bloody stoners! I kid, if anything ive to thank em, it was stoners who helped the first boom I remember when silk road went public way back in the day, ah when we thought 12 quid was a lot for a btc!

I buy stuff, I try telling myself ill save but then something will come on steam or catch my eye on Amazon or ill decide its time for a holiday, I suck at saving/investing as soon as I get enough for something cool I spend it

Humble bundle! Games charity and btc, cant really go wrong, but lately ive been burning lots of coins on flights (I LOVE destinia)

Yep theyre just itching to crush their own industry and ruin the company,  the dole is actually that good now!
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:01:46
Im not a holder either, since I started mining ive personally generated literally thousands of btc and currently I have 0.08. To me its a way of saving up for stuff, I cant spend btc on electric or general day to day crap (well I probably can but I dont) so I spend it on fun stuff like awesome stereo gear and flights all over the place to name but a few. 
Were not all bagholders and do I regret spending a single satoshi? Not for a second
