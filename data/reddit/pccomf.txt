That's also the first thing I thought of when I read that blog post. I'll believe it when Cryptsy's story is solid enough that it is willing open up the books to an outside investigation. In the mean time the story holds no weight. It is at least equally likely that this is just another exit strategy.
In any case, if someone can steal $7M from Cryptsy, and Cryptsy does not have the common sense to report it, then anyone trusting Cryptsy with any amount of money is a fool regardless of how this turns out.

Making someone agree to handle disputes with arbitration is different than that actually being enforceable. A dispute is also way different from being criminally negligent and at this point apparently insolvent enough to pay everyone out. Criminal and civil lawsuits are the only proper course of action now.

When I first imagined what Cryptsy's infrastructure looked like I imagined a complex array of firewalled individual nodes running a single coin daemon each. I was impressed at the amount of security that would have to go into attempting to keep something like that secure. It's hard enough for some companies to keep things secure when they don't run a hundred arbitrary binaries compiled by who knows who on a semi-anonymous website.
Wow did I give them too much credit.

The guys interviewing him sound friendly yet he is acting as if they are accusing him of something. His body language, dry voice, and mannerisms all scream that he is guilty of something. 
If someone told me that minutes before the video began he discovered or was informed about the 13K bitcoin heist, I'd believe it. He acts like someone who just learned something that horrible and is terrified.

Gas stations in bad areas do that more than ones in good areas. I avoid certain locations based on that. It's probably a good indicator of how safe I am standing at the pump also. Food for thought.

I'm not sure this is correct. I just looked at their fees page and the 1% only comes into play when converting currency to or from Bitcoin, but not sending/receiving Bitcoin.
They sweep deposited amounts into other addresses and make your withdrawal requests also from different addresses. Just make your withdrawals random compared to the deposits. For what it sounds like you are trying to do I believe that would make it difficult enough for non-Coinbase employees from tracking you.
