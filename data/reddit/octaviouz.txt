For my children.

Will never realize it.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:16:12
Wow. I don't even know what to say to this. It's like a drug addict. I wish I could shake you and say wake up!, but it wouldn't matter.
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:43:25
FUD? Wake the fuck up r/bitcoin....
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:01:09
You missed my point. Bitcoin would be worth enough money one day that this artificial fee market being created now should not be needed. 
The scarcity of bitcoin would cause the price per bitcoin to increase and when only fees were left to process those fees would be worth enough for miners to continue mining...
Lots of transactions + increase price in bitcoin = enough incentive for miners to mine for a fee reward alone.
Instead we are squeezing fees today and saying bitcoin is no longer for everyone... Might as well say we don't expect bitcoin to be worth enough that one day fees alone will be worth miners to mine. That doesn't bold to well for bitcoins future.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:22:16
yeah, cause we said "bye bitcoin" when litecoin came out lol. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:29:36
Everyone says he needs attention but didn't he do the opposite when this all came out and pretty much went into hiding?
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:56:51
well said.
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:00:08
Yeah, lets terrorizing bitcoin since it directly impacts his entire business model... you guys are nuts.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:41:01
I think the fee market doesn't need to exist. Before I bought into bitcoin many moons ago, no pun intended I ask the same question as I hope everyone did... what happens to miners when there are no more bitcoins to be released. Fee market was never once discussed. It was thought that Bitcoins would be worth so much at that time and with each halving their value increasing that the worth of miners fees would be close to what the reward worth is today or in the near future. (Not the amount of bitcoins but usable spending money... USD/Fiat for example)
We are now messing with the economics of the original idea of bitcoin and creating an artificial inflation of fees for fear that fees won't be enough for miners down the road. 
If bitcoin was really suppose to be the "end all" to currency, store of wealth etc, the price would be higher than what it is today, we wouldn't be worried about creating a fee market, there wouldn't be almost 1 billion dollars in one specific alt i won't mention. That money would be in bitcoin. Instead we are locked into this bullshit, head in the sand and opportunity just passes us by.
This was never up to the core team or any team to decide or force on bitcoin. The block size limitation was never in place to squeeze fees.

If bitcoin has the potential that we all think it does then today's bandwidth concerns could be resolved by innovation in the future and maybe even bitcoin driving that innovation.
but nah, lets take this future looking technology we call bitcoin  and build it to meet today's bandwidth concerns, I mean, we are building this around china right? lol
The short sighted vision in this sub blowssssss my mind.
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:30:23
If you play an april fools jokes the day before, your just a dick.
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:57:58
I would have figured the core team would have done this a year ago and they would react... oh wait.
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:36:35
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:25:13
I thought syscoin forked?
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:14:10
I would disagree. With the exception of regulation, this is about the only way to destroy bitcoin, so yes this is a nightmare scenario.
If anything it shows alot about human mindset. Ignore, make excuses, conspiracy theories, etc... 
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:58:56
You are what he described. Therefor you will never understand. Just think about that.

using it, love it. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:04:35
Since my post got downvoted to hell, i'll say it here.
Coinbase, Just make a commercial and this sub will love you again!
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:25:51
So force all transactions to use segwit?
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:33:26
well played.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:52:06
This is the exact definition of a bubble.
Bitfinex can only cash out to Taiwan backs for a +100 dollar gain, rebuy at less than 100 and repeat sell on bitfinex. This is why other exchanges are being driven up.
 Lots of money being made, hopefully my international account will be ready by tomorrow so I can get in on this before the pop.
Edit: In response to the replies... Yes i'd say the Arbitrage Opportunity is creating a bubble.
Bubble Definition: A stock market phenomenon which occurs when the stocks in a particular sector are inflated out of proportion to their intrinsic value in response to exaggeratedly high expectations of resale value.
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:45:18
Well you have me curious... 
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:26:30
Continue to make progress... lol
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:05:36
This is probably the scariest thing to happen to bitcoin recently. Disclaimer: I'm balls deep in BTC and ETH.....
All the stuff we said about BTC in the good old days, "first they ignore us, then they laugh at us, blah blah...."
We are doing the same thing to ETH and we should know better.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:39:50
Just give it an hour....
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:04:47
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:29:53
Nope, I think i was pretty close on this one.
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:28:47
Yeah and the money being made by cashing out on bitfnex to taiwanbank, rebuying at 100 dollars less per coin and then selling on bitfinex for 100 dollar gain is unreal.
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:10:31
So one man controls bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:32:59
Also Marking, there is lots of people buying alts for different reasons, not just "Jihan and Friends"
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:10:12
The dump will be epic. :P
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:02:30
I thought it was spam? /s
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:32:41
Most are, in fact bitcoin is at almost down 55% of the market share.... people are listening to your advice. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:23:54
i taste the salt in all your anti-eth posts.
@_date: 2016-05-28 13:22:24
Ironic huh....
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:28:00
like facebook to myspace several years ago :P
Now you don't need to do that.
@_date: 2016-05-19 23:42:30
Nope, What your going to see is Tokens that are created on the Ethereum network that represent assets or stocks in companies. Crypto just evolved man.
@_date: 2016-05-19 23:40:17
With ETH services offered on coinbase.com later this summer.
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:45:02
Scare you no, i was just telling you that people are following your advice, its working... bitcoin is pricing people out of their use cases and finding other options.... congrats
@_date: 2016-05-30 22:12:55
Love ya Vinny but I tend to disagree on this one. I look at the number of bitcoins same as number of tickets to an event.
We all know there will be 21 Million bitcoin available same as an event that has say, 21 Million tickets available. All the BS between now and the last coins (event starts) is all hog wash created by us. 
As the event gets closer people start buying at inflated prices most because they think they can sell them for more right before the event happens.
The price of tickets goes higher because people want to resell the tickets or say an entire organization decides to treat their members to the event so they buy up large amounts of tickets (China). Great timing because everyone who wants to resell them is also buying. Well since there was only 21 million tickets now the average joe has to buy at inflated tickets because everyone else is buying them too.
Right before the event happens people get nervous start selling their tickets for less and less. Finally they just dump them. Everyone waits around for the next event. 
Maybe we'll get lucky and that entire organization will keep buying tickets for the next event after this one. 
Hopefully the event is a moon launch. ;)

lol yep, that's what it is /s. It could never have to do with the upcoming coin split... 
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:58:50
I've used for around 10-15 purchase around 19% off, never an issue. Love it. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:55:03
i buy shit on there all the time, 19% has been the sweetspot for me. I like it. Never an issue. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:49:03
I don't buy it, speak up below all 20k
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:54:32
Where does it say it was a successful completion? Looks like they found a 3rd party to perform. 
"Engaging an auditor is just the first step. The comprehensive balance sheet audit, which will be dated June 30th, 2017, will require considerable time and resources on both sides. A third-party audit is important to all Bitfinex stakeholders, and we’re thrilled that Friedman will be helping us achieve this goal."
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:50:30
fair enough, maybe i confused you with another name i thought i saw... cheers!
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:59:29
This is old, the market reacted yesterday and recovered 
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:00:45
Of course they would. Once word got out they weren't then people would stop sending money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:25:35
Been with drawling at limit for days... no issues.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:44:31
People said the same things when they first heard about bitcoin. lol This guy... Vince Vaughn butt hurt.
