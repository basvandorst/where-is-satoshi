Picture taken by yours truly. MP is the skinny fellow in the suit seen on the right-hand side.
Whether you like MP or not, he's an actual human - 'exactly as printed on the box' - and at least three people in this thread will attest to having visited, having a few drinks with him.

At one point MP gave demos of his exchange and asked people to review. [Here's mine.]( (TLDR: it worked.)

I had the occasion to visit Mr. P and MPOE-PR in person last month, and they are in fact separate humans who look nothing alike. Believe it or not.

A new IRC channel was made, also on Freenode, called [ , and most of the old  folk now live there instead.

I personally run two of the nodes pictured at the link.
"Bitnodes" only lists folks who have version string &gt;= 0.8.
I wrote a [simple version-string spoof knob]( patch for TRB but AFAIK I (and one other fella) are the only ones using said knob. Most - can't be bothered (because... why?)

What other mumbling morons do you respect?

And funnily enough, no reaction then.

Choice gibblets:
*'We are unable to explain the true nature of these patches in public because they guard against absolutely terrible DoS exploits that can take down ANY Bitcoin node.  So instead we called it, "Minor efficiency improvement in block peer request handling." which is somewhat true of the patch.'*
*'Just so you know this stuff about Tor has me worried... Please don't make this public, but my day job involves intelligence, and I'm in a relatively high position. You know, I went into the job years ago with very different thoughts about it than I do now. The last, well, decade really has changed a lot of minds in this field, in totally different ways. Myself I am on the side of Snowden and Assange, but... lets just say when you have a family your willingness to be a martyr diminishes. The same is true of many of my colleagues. Hopefully my support for Bitcoin can help undo some of the damage we've done, but I do have to be careful and it's tough to take all the precautions I need to to be able to communicate. If it was found out that I was involved with Bitcoin that way I have been, let's just say there would be consequences...'*
*'Why not go ahead and say it? You know that Mike and similar will counter-argue that mining needs to be done by "responsible" central authority figures running pools, so let them make that bogus argument. I've seen Gavin criticising you for not working on making mining decentralized too, so go ahead and force him into a position of arguing against that.'*
*'You do a good job of signaling your priorities Gavin. The payment protocol includes no notion that you may want to pay anyone but a SSL certified merchant. Yes I know the crypto can be upgraded, but it says volumes that you pushed for that first, without even the slightest token effort to allow individuals to participate in any way. Sad given you have made things less secure because there is no safe way to get money into my wallet with the payment protocol, but could have been.'*

[This one.](
I personally [snipped out *all* invocations of DNS]( from the code. After which it built perfectly well as a static executable with [MUSL]( in place of Glibc.  Ask me anything! (TM)

My impression is that the ultimate object of the "validated" crap is: a government-imposed altcoin. Eventually, we will be told: "Trade your TerroristCoins for CleanCoins, with which you can even pay tax! Or else."
We're due for a rerun of the '90s "key escrow" wars, this time with cryptocurrencies.

Shitcoin was to be a voluntary and purely-decentralized mechanism for fighting scammers.
Still, I can't help but wonder if I am at least partly responsible for the idiocy under discussion.
