You need, like, ice cream, man. No one's ever upset eating ice cream.

Last two questions and I'm done sounding like an idiot. Thank you for your help and replies, I appreciate it a lot. Is coinbase safe/secure enough to have a couple btc laying around online? If I buy at the price right now, and the btc comes to my account next week, will it be at the price it was at time of purchase? (I'm assuming yes, but want to make sure)

Thanks for the kind advice, appreciate it.

Thank you, and thank you for refraining from telling me to suck a Nigerian dick this time :)

Just my way of saying thanks :)

If you weren't such a dick, I'd say thanks. Everyone started out somewhere, I chose a community I trust. I'm sorry you were forced to reply to my post.

I've got it all verified as far as bank account and credit card, just not identity yet...
I'm having trouble finding a "wallet" on coinbase, or I'm just probably doing it wrong. If I buy the BTC, will I have it that instant? Again, I'm sorry if this information is out there, but I'm having trouble understanding it all.

Did all that, seems like I have to verify my identity to enable instant buy. Sucks because I answered a question incorrectly =\. Maybe it's a good thing it's making me wait 24 hours.
