Yes they'd be gone - unless someone else has access to their wallet. It'd be good to include your bitcoin info in your will &amp; estate planning documents if you have any bitcoins.

Answered above - all bitcoins will be mined by 2140.

Without question. It’s the best.

The rate is 15% on what you've held for more than 1 year and 20% for less than a year, IIRC (in the U.S.)

"Billionaire" sounds so middle class. I think we should refer to you as a bitcoinionaire.

I could have bought Apple stock at $7 and been a gajillionaire. It's a waste of time to beat yourself up over not being able to predict the future. Though, the next time you see something that might be valuable, no harm in spending some spare $ to invest.

If you don't have your health, you don't have anything. Seriously. If you want someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I have sought mental health assistance in the past and regularly see a financial advisor.

Some people cope differently with new wealth. A high school kid with a few thousand btcs right now, and there's many of them out there, could cash out and pay off their parents house or pay for college -- well with college prices these days, maybe not. But regardless, this is a lot on a kid to deal with.

You don't HAVE to exchange $1000 for 1 BTC -- you can get some for $100 or $50. It's divisible.  Can we make that the new slogan, anybody? Bitcoin: It's fucking divisible.

I'm not based in Chicago but accept business across the US -- the 312 area code was the only one that could spell ROUTE-07 (768-8307) with a Google Voice phone number!  Though I do have good friends in Chi-town!  I'm in the Washington, DC area and I've done websites for companies in Austin, NYC, Boston and DC.

Also try not gambling money away.

This is reassuring but only explains bitcoins themselves and not the exchanges they're hosted on. I'm seeing online wallets and exchanges hacked left and right with bitcoins stolen. Are those stolen bitcoins useless to whoever gets them?
