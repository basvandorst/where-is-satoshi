I have followed him for a few years now. He had several companies and sold some for a lot of money, then subsequently lost all of it. Stockpickr is the most well known of those. 
Later he became a self help guru, selling quite a few books. They were genuine and helpful. But about a year or two ago he started pushing a subscription to his investment advice newsletter. Even then he never even mentioned bitcoin. 
He didn't come out of nowhere, he's well known in the startup world. But what he is doing now is selling a product, using methods totally opposite to what he did before. My guess is a company reached out to him with a deal he could not refuse. 
Too bad. His books were decent.

I am so sorry for your loss.

You say "when", I say "if". :)
Either way, I don't think that is for the short term, not for 2018. And honestly, I would love to be wrong about this...

The unpleasant truth is that we shouldn't expect a major bull run anytime soon. 
What happened at the end of 2017 was a gold rush. People got into crypto without really understanding it, they just wanted a piece of the pie. These people then lost part of their investment when demand reduced and many panic sold pushing it down even further. 
How likely do you think it is that people will forget that and buy with the same enthusiasm again? They didn't do it for the technology or ideology, they did it to make profit. From their perspective, they got burned. 
And that will take time.

Hodl but don't fall for this stuff.
