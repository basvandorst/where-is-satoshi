That's just it. There's serious concerns that they don't have a 1:1 exchange any more. 
They've just published an audit (from September 2017). Back then they had minted around 400,000,000 tether tokens. To date they have minted over 2.2 billion. That's billion with a b. Or around 1,800,000,000 since their last published audit. 
Just think about that number for a moment. Then remember they dissolved their relationship with their auditor recently. Highlighting even more concerns. 
This is bat shit crazy. It feels like an Enron type collapse is unfolding.

@_date: 2018-01-28 07:14:21
Scenario 1. Visa and mastercard prevent purchasing cryptocurrency because of added risk and number of charge backs
Scenario 2. Visa and mastercard add a surcharge for cryptocurrency purchases that have a higher risk for their business model.
I'm OK with this

It's not doing "nothing", the price is consolidating. Which in basic terms means the buyers and sellers are close to an agreement on the price.
Prolonged consolidation is good. It means a lot of people will be jumping on at this level. Instead of buying at $19k one moment and 18k the next. This creates a solid support level.

Australian here. It depends on how you're trading I guess. Personally I'm trading through my company and declaring profits as they hit my account less the amount I've invested, less the fees. 
I've toyed with the idea of sending every transaction to my accountant. But coinspot has made it too simple to switch between coins. I fear if my accountant has to work through every transaction he will be charging me more than it's worth.

However a few things might be different right now:

2. A lot of people are using lines of credit and life savings now (breaking the very rules the core investors set out)
3. New money is slowing down over Christmas

That's the state of the crypto world at the moment unfortunately.
Coinbase is fast becoming one of the most popular wallets because if its easy of access and quick fiat to crypto conversions. But you pay for the convenience.
The only other way to get back into it is through one of the exchanges. The verification process takes time. Once you're verified it's pretty easy though. I read somewhere kraken has 100,000 new applications a day.

Moving money from a wallet to the exchange takes 4-8 hours. Those with bitcoins in their wallet getting anxious would be a good indicator of future drops/rises.
Currently the unconfirmed transactions is sitting at around 121k. In comparison during that massive rally we had, it was sitting at 200k.

My prediction. The bitcoin market will look to futures to determine its value. If this trend continues futures will open lower forcing prices down further. If it stabilises it's anyone's bet.
But with 4-7 hour transfer times from wallets to exchanges you can guarantee a sell off will be long and protracted. We could just be seeing the beginning of all this.

So, you've built a time machine and you're wondering how many coins you can buy without jeopardising the exponential growth of bitcoin?
Welcome to the time travellers club. There's a few things you need to keep in mind to ensure your investment is still worth money when you return. 
Buying bitcoin in the early days may limit the supply to key individuals who changed the trajectory of bitcoin. It's not recommended taking coins out of circulation. 
Likewise you can't acquire your bitcoin from mining. This could change the outcome of future miners and/or the difficulty level. Which will have far reaching implications.
The best way to acquire as much bitcoin as you can without changing the future would be to seek out bitcoin wallets which have been lost. 
Make your way through some of the recent stories on reddit of people who lost their bitcoin. You will need to ascertain when OP lost their coin and what medium it was on (usb stick left in the garage, old laptops thrown out with bitcoin mining equipment, etc). 
Then do your research to determine where they were living at the time. Be thorough. If you travel to the year 2032 you can download the hacked reddit database to match the users email address to their social media accounts. 
Remember: Don't worry about the time it takes to research your targets. After all, you have a time machine, time is literally on your side. 
For the purpose of due diligence you will need to return the wallet to present time and check if the balance has been removed. It's possible that someone else found the laptop, usb stick, etc and has already spent the coins. If this is the case return the wallet to its original time and location (ensuring you don't meet yourself in the past). You need to time it just right. We all know what happened to John Mcafee in 2042 when he tried to go back in time to eat his own dick.
Good luck.

People keep comparing us to that graph of the dot com bubble. But they're forgotten that graph was over 5 years.
In comparison we would only be in the awareness phase (if it were to follow this path at all). Personally I feel it will be a cryptocurrency bubble. Bitcoin is a product not an industry. 
[Check out this graph here](
It's my belief we're on the bear trap phase 
1. This recent rapid growth (which has only been a few months) could be the awareness phase. Cryptocurrency has been in stealth mode and has now just taken off. 
2. Financial institutions are only now getting on board (think futures, etc) with more coming on board next year 
3. I believe we've seen the first major sell off. And in 2018 we'll be entering the media phase. Forget the media hype about bitcoin and think about the media hype of cryptocurrency in general. 
Get on board now boys and girls. Once this train departs it's gonna be one hell of a ride.

Regulating exchanges, ensuring they act fairly and generally protect consumers is not a bad thing in my opinion. It opens the market to more investors and funds which can't operate in an unregulated market.
Taxing the income from cryptocurrency legitimises the industry even more. Will it deter people from trading? Not in the slightest. Will it impact the price? Hell yes.
If they start regulating and find exchanges are grossly misrepresenting their position it will cause massive headaches.
Either way next year should bring some pretty awesome memes.

Personally I don't think this correction is over yet. New money will be slowing down over Christmas (banks closed, priorities, etc)
Keep an eye on unconfirmed transactions as an indicator of the number of people moving their bitcoin to exchanges for liquidity. When it drops under 200k again (around 180k) you have an indicator that people aren't so nervous.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:56
Ignore those which think they're better than you because you're asking a question.
Let me explain it as best as I can with my limited knowledge:
When a price increases sometimes it can go overboard. You can call this hype or fomo. When this happens the value can pull back a little to find the market value.
That's when you see a massive increase and then some pull back. The pull back is called a correction.
The higher the price goes without pullback the harder the correction will be. 
$20k for bitcoin would be ok if it was around that price for months (even years). But considering it was under $10k a month ago it suggests the price ran a little out of control.
Believe it or not a correction is good for the industry as a whole. And it's normal. Bubbles burst when a rally goes on too long and the correction becomes devastating. 
On a side note I don't think the correction is over yet. We'll see another dip in coming days. Just because we're aware of it, doesn't mean it will go away. Not with people wanting to take profits for Christmas and the holidays upon us.

But population growth would inevitably still generate new adopters to the system. 
And if Bitcoin is essentially an algorithm and not backed by government, commodities, etc, where's the longevity?
From an outsider watching this whole thing let me say the ideology surrounding Bitcoin becomes less and less inviting every day. resembles on bad days.
