I have some questions, Abby Martin (an American Journalist) was recently on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast and was talking about how U.S.A. sanctions are what have caused the crisis in Venezuela.  While the U.S.A. is not above meddling in foreign politics, were the sanctions so deleterious (harmful), and was the inflation of the Bolivar a response to those sanctions, or was the inflation directly tied to the policies of free stuff that was backed up by nationalizing the oil reserves?  I don't know how much trade Venezuela does with the rest of the world or how much they are self sufficient.  Was it a perfect storm?  Was it the U.S.A. meddling?  Was it the failure of socialism?
I have my own opinions and I feel that Martin is a mouth piece and/or useful idiot for the government of Venezuela, but I'd like to hear your opinion.  Abby Martin's guest spot with the podcast was JRE   Satoshis for you thoughts . . .

As a beautiful individualistic snowflake I'd say the community is a tiny horde of katydids in a cave screaming at each other and I don't regard any other animals' vocalization as important.

without the currency, it's just a database, and without the reward for hashing there is no incentive to secure the ledger cryptographically.  Without the incentive to secure it, the ledger either becomes vulnerable to networks with greater hashing power or should just be treated like a centralized database.  I think everyone coming on board at the moment with the "blockchain good, currency bad" platitude, if the they think about it long enough, is going to run into one of those 'when you see it' moments.  I never thought the currency was bad, but one morning I woke up and my first thoughts were of the interdependence with the reward/security aspect of the technology, and this aha moment makes me shake my head at the people who espouse the beauty of the blockchain but poo-poo the currency.

amazing that one bored programmer can do the work of financial investigation that would take a team of 12 federal agents and half a million dollars.  Can we get some love for the blockchain!

What field of employ do you donate your time to?

I'd take 100% in BitCoin.

Ah, thank you for the information, thought it was confined to NYC.  If it does become a 50-state model I'll use my private keys from a different territory.

easy, the machine acts as a third party trust and authorizes the lost disc cost, holds it in escrow until the disc is returned and when it is return, cancels the transaction.

isn't that how bitcoins were stolen from the today show,  People showing a QR code on the television?

What a wonderful transition to make in thinking about value denominations.  No need to convert NZ to US to BTC, Just thinking of value in terms of BTC.

as far as I'm concerned NYC is not the center of the universe, nor does their executive authority radiate any further than their physical borders.  Those eager tax beavers and protectionists have really shot themselves in the foot for the next 100 years unless they repeal it.  I'm watching an Antonopolous speech right now talking about the only real growth in the economy right now is around Bitcoin startups and NYC has in essence said, "we don't want your kind around here".

It would work like this: I don't work for the company, I volunteer, there's no need to "pay" me in fiat currency because I'm aloud to "give away" my labor, therefore there's no paperwork to file, no record, no income taxes.  If I choose to let the taxing authority know what I've made then I will pay taxes, but I doubt they'd accept my bitcoin.

They really need to integrate BTC with their coinstar machines.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:02:38
so if you were going to use paper BTC you'd need to have a public key wallet to pay it to before printing it out?

so pairing with Coinbase, would this allow merchants to essentially take a customer's fiat and place an automatic buy order for bitcoin and get paid in bitcoin without the customer ever knowing it?  I saw in the article that uber and airbrb utilize Braintree, could an uber driver choose to be paid in bitcoin even if their customer had never heard of bitcoin?

FYI, title in your html header has a spelling error.  Says Brizilian instead of Brazilian.  Congrats though!

this.  essentially has a premium like ATMs but I've used the site both ways, to buy and sell.  Haven't done a deep dive into the obfuscation of accumulation but because you're simply buying "gifts" for other people should be no problem.

MacroMen talking about how excited they are about Bitcoin even though they don't understand it.  They probably understand it better than the other 98% of the population.  Mr. Tapiero talks about how he doesn't understand portions of the whitepaper and I find myself wanting nothing more than to sit down with copies of it in front of us and go through it line by line and explain to him why it works.  For someone so smart to have gaps in his knowledge puffs me up a little bit, but also really tugs at my heart strings to hold his hand through the process of understanding the early iteration of the software.  We'll leave BIPs for another day.
