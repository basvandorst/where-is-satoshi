You are directly handing your money to bitpay you stupid fuck. But hey let's validate your sense of superiority and entitlement anyway and say bravo, all those people you ripped off in the past by pirating their hard work deserved it because they didn't accept Bitcoin.

Omg like whatever dude. It's as if somebody asked "you wanna go to the moon" and people were like "yeah alright" and you came out and said "but we don't know how to get there". The point is that we're going to the moon so shut up

This should really be a TV show... Ulbricht, corrupt DEA guys, Karpeles, Satoshi Nakamoto, Hacking Team... The pop corn just keeps coming

Right dude. In the future, I want to see more transactions on the Bitcoin network. I think the solution to that is upping the block size limit. Too easy right?

Did you even try to understand the point of LTBcoin? I guess not?

Uh oh. This could be serious.

Yeah, can you believe they experimented with Bitcoin tech to create their own micro crypto currency for their community, just like you expect people to leverage this amazing technology. Nothing has made me angrier.

Because that's not how Netflix works. It's a monthly subscription, not VoD. Have you ever used Netflix before?
