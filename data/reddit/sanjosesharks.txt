Bitcoin taught me how to use money. I was horrible with personal finance/budgeting/saving before I started reading about bitcoin.
It gave me something to believe in. Something i could get interested in that was about technology and directly related to finance. It gave me a reason to save money when my otherwise spend-a-holic habits were consuming me.
I was living paycheck to paycheck before i found out about bitcoin. Now every time i get paid i get excited that i have something to invest it into.
because of the volatility I realized it's not safe to have all my money in one place so i set up an emergency fund in my bank account.
These are concepts I had absolutely zero clue about before. I never took finance/business/economics classes in school. I was always hyperactively interested in science and technology and video games.
When bitcoin came a long it gave me a good reason to tie those two things together. Because of bitcoin i'm prepared in case of an emergency. I am beginning to feel prudently invested(bitcoin and otherwise). Its fantastic.

I'm not sure how that'd work. All I know is my blockchain transactions post instantly but it's been 5 hours and my Coinbase transaction still hasn't posted to my BTCT account. Really sucks for trying to invest at an opportune time.

Oh i guess i misread the time capsule thing... I was thinking it'd be 10 years. You're right. Seems like SD cards are probably going to remain popular in the mobile phone industry for 3 years.

Even if I only want to send 0.001 BTC to my new paper wallet it asks for the private keys to all of my previous paper wallets, even though each is funded with 1.0+ btc each.

Seems like having experienced people selling bitcoins locally thru that site or through craigslist would provide a great service to the currency. not only do they find a source to buy it but If you're (they) are like bitcoind3 then you can help explain some of the the intricacies of transactions/mining etc... while you wait for confirmations.

you're talking about yourself right? I'd love to have my youth into 2023 but I think it'd cost more than that, and i don't really trust technology to improve enough by then that they'd be able to safely thaw me.

I heard about them in 2009-2010. Price was really cheap if i remember correctly, i was debating investing $800 into a new gaming computer or just investing into bitcoin. 
I invested in the computer with a radeon GPU thinking i could mine in the off time. For some reason I had some errors come up and I couldn't get the miner to start going so i just said fuck it.
I forgot about bitcoin... Forgot about it 100% until the recent crash from 260 made internet news. I am pretty bitter that I gave up on being an early adopter. At the time my financial situation was pretty dismal. Except i was able to buy an 800 dollar gaming computer so I assume I was just much worse with my finances back then.

Now I don't know if this is serious, I'm a newb to all of this.

I'm going to send you a request, just in case.
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:33:19
No I know. I haven't. The only thing i've done is bought 1 coin on coinbase.
I just wanted to feel involved. Haha.
I'm just trying to read more about it when I have some spare time. Trying to understand it all, y'know?
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:07:47
I believe it was recorded in a parody comic book sketch, though my memory eludes me. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:37:11
Coinbase is based in San Fran I believe.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:45:19
That may be correct. I haven't a problem like this before. The last 4 of my purchases have only been 1.5 BTC, immediately sent to my investment account and immediately posted.
Apparently upgrading to 2btc is a concern for them.
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:49:13
Well now I feel bad for not using the search function properly. Thanks for taking the time to compile this list. I'm going back to the bit coin subreddit to read more. Thanks again 
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:25:34
I tried mining in 2010 for a while. For some reason I had network errors or program errors and I thought oh well fuck it, it's just a couple bucks. I gave up super quick on it and now i'm kicking myself in the butt for not taking the steps to fix it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:19:39
I had problems with this a few years ago when i was playing WoW. I had the blizzard Authenticator on my phone and didn't realize it would fuck everything up once i put Cyanogen on my Google Nexus.
Ever since that big problem I havent been rooting my phones.
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:29:53
Probably by checking active ports while not playing.
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:08:53
Yea i was thinking about the possibilities of using it as a more secure way to keep money safe while traveling and staying in hostels/backpacking etc..

Dude could be a multi-millionaire making a frivolous investment the same way I buy a lotto ticket every couple of weeks. I can spare the money even though i know it's not a good investment it's also not going to cripple my bank.
I understand he spent '40k' worth on BTC but don't make snap judgements is what i say. 
Edit: I played blackjack next to a guy who lost 200,000 without batting an eyelash, this happened 3 weeks ago. When he bought in again the bankers of the casino had to personally give their okay. Then he asked me to cut the deck because the last time he cut he lost.
@_date: 2013-05-22 06:29:03
Sounds like he actually bought a rather quick introduction into bitcoin.

Since USB is on every device since the mid nineties i would include an SD card&gt;USB reader so that it's convenient to read when you get it.

Yes i can't remember the last time my dad gave me a dollar told me not to spend it all in one place. I was probably 8 buying comic cards.
To be optimistic though this is a really cool way to spark the idea of bitcoin to somebody. All of the sudden they're given (in their eyes) a dollar. It's electronic and it's called a bit coin? "What is this?" they say
@_date: 2013-06-26 01:20:10
This worked. Again I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 00:56:34
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

I'd probably cash em out and go buy a new car. Summer is starting and my AC is out.
I might look around for simple ways to buy a car in bitcoin but at this point that's unrealistic and it would be financially wise to get rid of my 17 mpg sedan(premium) as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:31:38
And we're sitting here contemplating why women aren't interested in bitcoin? Maybe because of comments like this? perhaps?
Don't get me wrong, I laughed, but seriously think of the situation. It's pretty ironic(probably not actually irony, i dont care).
@_date: 2013-05-19 00:28:20
I'll try it out!

I just used it and it was 100% instant. Clicked the Purchase button and then by the time It took me to copy my BTC-TC wallet address I was able to send it over.

GOAT typically means Greatest of all time... However I don't believe this is the circumstance it's being used in.
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:45:21
Depends on your definition of beginners. I see a beginner  bitcoin community interested that has no idea what google auth, paper wallets, or drop are.
This is where i was 4 months ago...
Something easy would be similar to those accounts Starbucks uses so that their customers can pay with accounts already credited online.
They show up to the register and scan a QR code off their phone and then they're good.
Ninja edit: i knew what those things were but I had never used them. I consider myself more tech saavy than the next guy walking by on the street and thats the sort of adoption were aiming for right?
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:28:55
As part of this group I can confirm. If i hadn't lost interest in bitcoin in 2010 because I was literally poor I would have a much different answer.
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:00:40

I bought 1 just to test it out, Definitely didn't have any intention of buying JUST 1 bitcoin today, haha.

Purely conjecture but i would assume the kind of people that use Bitcoin would most likely have a google account.

Similar story: I had about $1000 in 2011. I was using a shitty laptop at the time and i really wanted to play Crysis 2. I had been reading a little bit about bitcoin and I wasn't sure if I should invest. I had bills to pay and was working around 25 hours a week at starbucks.
I decided to build a gaming rig and mine bitcoin in the offtime instead of buying $1000 dollars worth of coin. So i built my sweet gaming rig with AMD radeon cards, Dual 6970's in crossfire.
I tried to set up mining for a few weeks and couldn't figure out why my computer wouldn't mine. Don't remember if it was a software issue, a firewall issue, or maybe a network problem. I couldn't figure it out so I gave up.
I just decided, fuck it i'll play some games and forget about using my computer to mine these seemingly cheap/worthless hard to spend bitcoins.
Yea.... 
I could be a LOT further along right now. Not having finance troubles and whatnot. 
On the brightside I have an awesome job now(40k a year, sure as hell isn't starbucks wage).

paper wallets = way to go.
@_date: 2013-06-21 03:29:09
They do... Scroll down on the main page and search for your phone. Let the drop down menu come up to click the correct model. New page will load and it will display the amount of BTC on the left. There are 3 radio boxes for "Broken" "good" and "flawless". My old samsung galaxy s 2 in good condition is apparently worth about 0.56 BTC to them.
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:53:38
wouldnt an answer be a paper/brain savings wallet and then a small 'checking' wallet that's on a phone? phones and phone apps will upgrade with technology/time invested and just consider it a wallet that you don't fund unless you expect to be paying BTC for something soon.
I know this ruins the idea of being able to pay on the spot for something while still having that money 'secure' but it seems like a good proposition until the bitcoin becomes more universally accepted.

No I don't. Not sure by I capitalize BitCoin like this... Now that you pointed it out I'm pretty sure I do this all the time.
I have very pragmatic handwriting when it comes to what is capitalized and what isn't(otherwise my handwriting sucks). I suppose it bleeds over into my typing a little bit? I'm not sure.

From what i understand the Majority of people will be the ones who make up the 49%. I.e. If INTEL decided to mine coins right now with special processors they could take over 51% of the blockchain but they wouldnt make up more than 51% of the people using or mining bitcoin.
Therefore the majority of the bitcoin user/miner populace would decide to go back to the last fork and ignore all of Intels contributions to the blockchain since then.
I am a complete bitcoin newb but this is how i understand it. If i am wrong please correct me because I would like to learn what is wrong with my understanding of how we plan to avoid 51% attacks.
@_date: 2013-05-27 06:08:02
No I think what he's saying is one day when bitcoin has a more widely spread adoption then we're still going to see price manipulation the same way we do with gold and currency. We're going to have to live with it but that doesn't mean were fucked. There are still much better reasons to favor bitcoin over what we had 4+ years ago.
