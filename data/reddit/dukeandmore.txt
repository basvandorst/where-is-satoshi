For real though this would be great step forwards for adoptions as if a population so concentrated required payments to be excepted in BTC then big corperations would have to switch over just from the pure loss of sales in one town

I love the amount of help you are recieving OP!

Oof decent execution dude! I'm predicting a lot of going back and forth between the 9 to 12.5 regions throughout the near future. I have been having my eye around the 6 k mark as well for a fall, despite the halfing coming up it's possible the price has already booked from it and is over saturated.
I see your point with the risk, especially with how much uncertainty in regulations that exist. Although personally I think the coins will stop being so volatile once more people get involved and understand

Sweet, i'll check it out

Agreed, I realised the high ROI I gained when we reached yearly highs not too long ago, took out all of my original investment, when the 'inevitable' drop happened I was hella appriciative of the fact I did so. Now i'm back to buying.
I understand it could have bitten me in the ass but as of now I don't have regrets, if I were HODLing then my ROI would not be as high

Thank you for the honest comparrison. Too many people in the crypto space (and investments in general) are always very bias as they beleive its possible to benefit in some way or another by doing so.  In an ironic sense as bitcoin is open source and all about clarity in the space, yet that clarity seems to fall apart when people are involved.
You deserve an upvote for this.

I remember it was for myself. But ANYONE who is investing in ANYTHING should do research into it, of which it only takes 10/15 minuites to realise that Bitcoin is completly different to all other "BTC" style derivatives.

Essentially dude, because the price of 1 BTC is rather high (and hopefully will keep rising) people came up with the idea of giving a fraction of a BTC a name, this will help with the overall adoption of the currency as, for example, you wanted to buy a coffee with some BTC it would be a lot easier to call the price half a Satoshi than say 0.000005 BTC.  But yes they are the same thing on the same network, as of now I do not own a full BTC but I own quite a few Satoshi's. As someone else put it, its similar to the 100 pennies in a pound.
The idea behind this was created years ago as all possibilities of where this cyrpto space could lead have been thought of.
I hope this clears some stuff up.

When you say closed acccount you mean CB? or Natwest?
@_date: 2019-10-01 10:19:51
Sick shit! I think more street artists should incorperate this sort of meaning into there stuff.

Before getting into the crupto space, my future seemed short, a 'short term goal' for me was planning two/three days ahead. Now on the other hand, short term is years, I'm learning patiance, how to deal mentally and emotionally with a volatile market
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:24:05
Make a post on this sub about it? I'll be interested to see what you find out, as I only really started noticing what they're doing a few days ago
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:22:59
Neither am I, basic language means easier learning and subsequently easier adoption
