Done. Also for the Copy-Pasters: 
Hello, since the multiple scamming attempts of Roger Ver to fool people into thinking BCH is BTC, this is a major one, that the Logo color of BCH is still orange, it should be Green as listed on many exchanges. Bitcoin Cash PNG Logo files - [ \- Kindly update the logo on the website!
Thank You,
Bitcoin Supporter.

Grant permission by the authorities of the college/institutes we are holding the programs in. Also, this is not a scam, once the team is ready, we will post all updates/videos.

Yes. That’s what we are trying. Didn’t receive much support yet though.

Not really. The buying and selling of Cryptocurrencies through "Banks" governed by RBI is banned in India. You can still Buy/Sell from P2P platforms such as Localbitcoins. Also, there is no ban on the Use and Storage of cryptocurrencies.

Thanks mate!

Hey. Thank you for the generous tip. Yes this is 100% genuine. Currently I’m gathering a team for this. Regardless of the donations, we are definitely doing this in March. :)

That's not a random website, that's like a Patreon for cryptocurrencies, you can start a fundraiser on that. Also, yes the team is formed, but not yet ready, some members need training. Anyway, we're going through with the program in March regardless of the donations received, but the donations will only make it easier. If you don't wish to help out, that's fine, but atleast don't try to drag someone who's actually putting an effort to spread information about Bitcoin, down with baseless accusations like "IT IS A SCAM". Our goal is to make people, especially the young adults aware of Bitcoin &amp; crypto.
