Yes. It could be a nice idea, but is it still profitable in 2019/20?

Wouldn't it be easy to pirate?

25M. Thanks for the compliment, because I grew up on the internet trying to communicate with the world.
No, they don't hate them. They are not extremists or Islamists.

Yes, but what kind of videos?...

How can I convert it to BTC without paying a lot of fees and also considering the fact that many exchanges ban Iranians?

Unemployment is a huge problem here and many jobs pay peanuts even by the Iranian living standards. It's not affordable to buy Bitcoins here.

Thanks. But I'm more into bounties or jobs or anything which would pay high. I can translate, but unfortunately, no one wants a Persian translation :(

That's not an option for a heavily corrupted country. There's a mafia behind that, and also, there's no privacy defined for postal mail in Iran. Lots of stories on stolen items from international post packages or letters in/out of Iran, like stolen dollar bills, etc. So I'm guessing they would discover and screw me.

Thanks, my friend.

Apparently, it doesn't work for people from Iran. Internet access is also very expensive here, so watching videos to get paid would be unprofitable.
