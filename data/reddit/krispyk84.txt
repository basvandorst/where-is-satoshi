He spread false hope and said he just finished speaking to Mark directly. That's just rumour mongering that was likely driven by motive.

You speak as if $550 is high. Yes it was relatively high, but still a depressed value. The market really wanted to put this Gox stuff behind them and move on with allowing the market to grow without the dark cloud of Gox looming overhead.

Hey man, good luck with your criminal conviction and all. I find something awfully coincidental though. Bad news came out about Gox: the resignation and the strange twitter account tweet wipe. Those are iffy events that are enough to shake the markets confidence. At the same time, a MASSIVE sell wall goes up on Bitstamp. Typically we'd think that the sell wall is to drive the price down so that the whale could lift it and buy cheap coin. The only problem is, the wall stands. This whale wants to sell these coins, that much has become clear. And this whale doesn't want the market to crash while selling it. 
This poses a few question. Why is the whale selling? and Why do you show up all of a sudden and spread unsubstantiated news that aides to keep the price stable enough? We know you're a high net worth individual in the world of bitcoin. Are you the whale?

The best hack message would be to write up an official sounding statement that's one sentence long, followed by instructions to "direct any further inquiries to [insert Tokyo bankruptcy law firm here]". The markets would go nuts...

Definitely a great exchange, but yes, there needs to be much better charting. Would love for an API too so it can interface with QT Bitcoin Trader.
Looking forward to this exchange's growth. Would love to see more volume.

Here's a document that many are dismissing as FUD. I personally did too until I started thinking about a few things.
The document cites the morning of the 25th to announce a Gox shutdown. Trading is halted, the shutdown is live. If this document is fake, the faker doesn't have the power to shut down trading on Gox which lends credibility to the document.
The document also features liabilities that show that Gox has over $160 million in Liability. $55 million in fiat, and over $100 million in BTC. They did a BTC to Fiat conversion so in the court of law, if it came down to it, their liabilities would have to be repaid in fiat. That being said, Gox knew they would be MUCH better off if they had a price for BTC on their exchange at less than $160 per bitcoin, so they did whatever they could to crash their own market to lower their liabilities. They halted trading at $135. They probably could have done more damage to the price, but bitcoinbuilder's arbitrage pressure was pushing the price up to points that they were not happy with. They froze at $135 for a reason.
The way the liabilities section of that document is spelled out and the dropping of the goxBTC price, as well as their freeze point lends more credibility to the document as well.
A lot of you feel that they are just down to switch to Midas. If this document turns out to be true, 750,000 lost BTC is going to hurt bitcoin really really bad. I'm afraid of what such news will do to the market...

Sure, but you had an educated guess on the state of Gox. But that's all it was, a guess. One that just happened to be correct. 
What Charlie led us to believe was that there was good news coming. He even cited that he had a direct conversation with Mark as his source. 
The market before the collapse was already depressed. Good news from Gox would have driven the price up as it would have renewed faith in the industry. The market was tired of the string of bad news that has been coming out of September so they were reaching for anything positive to put this chapter of Bitcoins history behind them. 
To have somebody who was the CEO of a major company in the bitcoin ecosystem, somebody who had investment and personal relationship with the rest of the top brass in Bitcoin, go around and use his position to spread positive news that turned out to be false is grossly irresponsible. 
Even if he wasn't certain 100%, like he claims he wasn't, it is grossly irresponsible to say anything at all. But he did. It's not just rumour mongering. It's market moving. This leads me to believe that he had motive for saying these positive statements that turned out to be false. He seemingly focused on his own personal interests rather than on the health of the community. I think it's bull if true. And sadly, it seems to be true. I just find it ironic that he's being hailed as a crusader for the good of Bitcoin in that coin desk article.

You're also taking his word too. He might be a great guy, and telling the truth when he said he lost 550 btc, but if you examine his motives for sharing that with the community, you can see that a major motive was to provide empathy to the community in an effort to soften the negative impact that the gox collapse has.
550BTC is a lot sure, but a drop in the bucket to what he's got...

Makes me think that they deleted the tweets to make it more difficult for anybody to mount a legal case against them when this shit hits the fan. By removing the public tweets, the only way to get them is by a court ordered request to twitter which takes time and resources. Time that Gox can use to build a defence or flee. This move was probably done on advice from a lawyer.

Last I checked, I didn't have to rely on a bank or other institution in order to get a movie off of bittorrent. Governments can put a strangle hold on the banking network that BitCoin happens to rely on for success. Law enforcement has even been arresting people who trade on Localbitcoins down in Florida. If driven underground, what good is it as a currency? No retailer would ever take it if outlawed. It then loses practicality.

Imagine everyone in the room has a notepad to keep track of transactions. On everyones notepad, it says that I have 10 bitcoins, and Johnny has none. If I wanted to give Johnny a bitcoin, I announce to the room that I would like to transfer 1 from my 10, to Johnny. Everybody in the room updates their notepads to say that I now have 9 bitcoins, and Johnny has 1.
I didn't physically give Johnny a bitcoin. And nobody can dispute the transaction because everybody in the room has the same details on their notepad.
This is the nature of the peer to peer bitcoin ledger system, and it's a very simple analogy to how bitcoin transactions actually happen.
Start from this. It's easy for everyone to visualize.

This will make it nearly impossible for anybody to make legitimate claims to Gox for their coin/money if there are any claims to be made as Gox will now never be certain if the customer making the claim is ACTUALLY the customer.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:03:51
This all just makes it incredibly hard for any users to claim anything in their Gox account, because now Gox can't fully confirm or be sure that the client is the actual client.

Exactly. This move shows that he has no confidence (or intention) in his ability to make right on the situation going down right now at Gox.

By having polished and prepared statements with strong wording that used the word 'insolvency', I'm led to believe that many of the top brass knew enough that Gox was definitely going to collapse and that they will be doing a lot of damage to bitcoin.
Sure they might not know the 'full' story, but they knew enough to know that things were about to get real.

Charlie Shrem claims he had no idea things were bad at Mt.Gox before he came on reddit and spread false hope. These positive claims were made while 'somebody' was dumping $6 million of BTC on Bitstamp.
How am I supposed to believe Charlie didn't know, when Two-Bit Idiot says in this video that he corroborated with Charlie on the leaked document to get it authenticated and they both concluded that it was real BEFORE his reddit comments.
All this does is prove to me that Charlie knew shit was about to get really bad at Mt.Gox yet he came on here to spread false news that things were looking good? Why? Did he want to keep the price relatively high so that he could offload $6 million in BTC in time?
Self interests by those the community looks up to is going to hurt the community...

I’m half Lebanese and part of a Lebanese based what’s app group for Bitcoin with over 100 members. The challenge for them is access to exchanges that will actually service them. Most exchanges that run AML compliance programs tend to avoid countries like Lebanon that have a secretive banking industry and some past events involving money laundering. Electricity is not reliable so mining is also a challenge. Bitcoin right now is selling at a high premium.

It's easy to jaywalk and share files. It's a major pain to exchange fiat to Crypto. If they make crypto illegal, there are still other barriers that are keeping the majority of people from doing it. A flat out ban would be crippling
