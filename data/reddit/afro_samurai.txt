'Supposedly' encrypting something before sending it to a third-party is the farthest thing from a reasonable assurance of security, especially not when
     gpg -e -u "Sender" -r "Receiver" somefile
works as well now as it did 20 years ago.

I haven't been paying much attention, but none of the coverage I've heard so far hasn't mentioned the Bitcoin aspect.

My friend runs btcnow.com and was originally using Google Checkout, but had issues with customers making chargebacks, but I don't believe he had any issues being a bitcoin merchant. I was able to buy from him without any problems.

I don't think it looks particularly good, and I wonder if it could give the impression that Bitcoin and his campaign have something to do with one another.

I've got a standing Mt Gox order to buy 23.5 coins at $0.50 each, which I proceed to hoard and sell at the next peak.

Will miners still have to calculate something? Will the difficulty continue to rise? 
@_date: 2013-03-01 02:55:36
Processors that are purpose built for a specific use, in this case mining. That specialization allows them to do those tasks much faster. Not cheap, but can mine fast enough to pay themselves off fairly quickly as I understand.
