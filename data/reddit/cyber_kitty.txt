Prove you're not a scam artist (sorry I have to ask)

Cloud storage as it currently stands is a bit of a ridiculous proposition. I have a terabyte NAS sitting within my LAN, and you want me to pay WHAT per GiB every month?

It could be the case that the technology is slightly different between carriers and countries.

I think you've hit the nail on the noggins. This is acceptable to me, but it's an interesting way of passing risk to the user in order to give the 0% fee.

Thanks for the reddit submission of a blog post about a tweet linking a news article.

Thanks! :) I'll spend it right away

Wouldn't that get massively spammed? I remember searching on the gnutella network was pretty spammy back in the days. Most results were malware.

Speaking of currentc, we should definitely boycott it along with softcard. Whenever a late-comer to a market tries to block existing players out of the market via illegal means, we should simply not tolerate their business to survive.

Yes, the current centralized, "dumb" dinosaur grid needs to go. Imagine a decentralized network where nodes exchange bitcoins for consumption/production/storage.

Were they convicted of bitcoin crime? Is that why they have to stay put in Australia?

Would be interesting to know. All I could think of are password reuse, weak password, or phishing attack.
Although I would think that guessing the password or a dictionary attack being possible would be unlikely after  awareness from [a previous security incident](

Wouldn't this mean it is vulnerable to BadUSB?

Meee! :)

If only there was a technology to eliminate the middleman...

That's very interesting from a business strategy point of view. Definitely unthinkable for a bank to do the same. Just keeping my Coinbase account, just in case.
