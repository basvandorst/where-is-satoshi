A lot of metals are used in jewelry. A lot of metals are used in electronics. Most of golds valuation comes from speculators, it's an ancient bubble. It has real world use in a society without cash or software, but in our society I don't think it's that valuable. 
Bitcoin is software based on blockchain tech. It's impossible to counterfeit, encrypted, democratic sharing of power and a way for people to not rely on corrupt entities like banks. It's an avenue into other blockchain tech that is trying to revolutionize the world like powr, neuron, etc.
Sure if society collapses gold will be more valuable, but if society collapses we'll be worried about a lot more serious shit like food and water, than the loss of gainz.

Indian govt is a joke, they can’t regulate anything

No poor analogy, if you gain on stock you convert from stocks to fiat. Crypto to crypto has no fiat conversion, the trading pairs vary.

Okay but your solution is impossible to implement. As India adopted hyper capitalistic model its society has morphed and changed, and the govt has become far more corrupt and inefficient. I know in general Indians are nationalist while paradoxically accepting and aiding corruption in their society but dumping more money into a dead system is not the answer.

Certain elements of the Right will move more and more towards crypto as the culture wars heat up.

Aside from some limited use in electronics, what is the 'real world' use for gold? I'd say bitcoin is far more valuable than gold
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:16:09
In our current society bitcoin is far more valuable than gold. It's usage is far more than gold. Even if both went to 0, bitcoin would rise far faster than gold would due to its decentralized and encrypted nature.
In a society that is something similar to Mad Max or ISIS caliphate, gold will rise faster.
'Real world' usage is dependent on context. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:15:34
It's use will be heavy in the third world 
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:00:09
The greater the use and adoption, the more stable it will become. Once hundreds of millions use btc, pumpers will be useless.

Forks are a form of inflation, don't kid yourself if you think they're not the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:26:16
It's not a failure but the number of forks will increase over time and damage things considerably 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:53:56
Increasing confusion, decreasing confidence and most importantly subterfuge. 
B2X, BCC are subterfuge attempts. BTC Gold and other side chain splits were money grabs. There are talks of BTC Silver now. 
Eventually there will be so many forks that it will rob enough value from BTC to scare people off. Also many alts that would enter the marketplace will make their own private blockchains, because BTC forks simply rob value from alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:33:02
The forks will destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:17:17
They refunded their useless coins, not btc. They never gave warning and just dumped the coins on the market. It was 100% a ponzi with an exit scam. Most people got fucked.

Bitconnect was taken down due to people speaking out against it. Cryptonick, Trevon, Craig Grant, etc are all going to be in trouble. The more people that speak out against this guy, the more likely he will also be shut down. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:01:40
They were receiving money from their 'referrals', it was a ponzi so they made money off the ponzi and the ads.

Their entire wealth is predicated on a resource that is tied to a dominant fiat currency for the last 50 years. The very reason why the owners of this fiat currency wage wars when other states with such resource shift their allegiances. 
Their entire infrastructure is built by a slave class from south Asia. 
Their entire religious base is based on supreme brainwashing, a brainwashing that has convinced 1.5 billion people it's 100% true. I know I used to be one. 
Their best educated pay Western universities to train them. They pay for the best spots in schools around the world at top dollar, irregardless of scores. 
His opinion is useless.
