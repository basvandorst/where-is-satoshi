And you can't take a ripped up with parts missing paper wallet to a bank to have them exchange it for what you lost (you can with cash)
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:33:08
Is this the same thing that RobinHood does?
@_date: 2018-09-29 20:56:35
Sounds super vague based on a lack of actual understanding, but that's just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:08:10
They don't reveal what the spread is so it is a secret market spread. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:54:20
Do they have an effect on the network though?
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:13:33
It's a perfect analogy. In that analogy, the fact that smoking causes cancer is not okay, just like in this analogy, the fact that the subreddit can be blatantly misleading is not just something that's "ok"
Thanks for that analogy, it's perfect. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:14:14
It really depends what parts, but yeah in a lot of parts of course it's frustrating. Notably this one. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:30:20
Oh you care about truth now? lol
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:52:39
I cannot imagine that either of these people are worth listening to about anything. Whatever these people represent, I'd love to not be a part of it. I could not watch this long enough to get to anything of value, and at 5 minutes in, I don't feel like it could possibly be worth it. 
So much of the crypto community is filled with get rich quick idiots who luckily got rich quick off of crypto and now people think their opinions are of value and they congregate at stupid events like this to find like-minded new money idiots to talk about crypto with (and the rest are get rich quick idiots trying to figure out the secrets to getting lucky). 
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:10:57
That's a pretty insane spread imo. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:26:27
Could you explain further a scenario in which those nodes would be secure or help decentralize the network? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:04:49


I love how Fortune still has to explain to its user base that reddit is a website. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:22:33
Yeah I will say what CashApp does right is trusting your money sources quickly enough to make the purchase. I guess because it has the foundation of Square.com? It's interesting that Coinbase can't pull the money from banks nearly as quickly, but I'm guessing it's because Square built the foundation as a USD moving company long before joining the bitcoin crowd. 
(I have to edit this, because every reply I need to wait 10 minutes since this is a new account, but I like what u/GeneralZex replied with. Good both as an investor in Square and Bitcoin. The idea of all Square payment locations accepting Bitcoin is so huge. I live in an area where those things are everywhere)
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:47:37
I disagree, as people refer to it often as a resource that they get their news from. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:48:03
Aw, you think the community won't shift to cost more for transaction fees once bitcoin is worth 100k? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:27:23
Is this the same subreddit that freaked out about the media bringing too much attention to this man?
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:33:38
"If you don’t know anyone who is willing to sell you some Bitcoin, the first place to look for is a Bitcoin ATM. Most large cities have one, check on the internet if you are lucky and there is one nearby. Bitcoin ATM’s are fairly easy to use and let you purchase Bitcoin anonymously with you credit or bank card."
I don't think this article knows what anonymous means. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:23:41
Not when it's misleading/misinforming... it's really not okay at all. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:10:58
I've been out of the loop for a bit. Is it not a crazy cost to move Bitcoin around anymore? Last I was active it was like a $20 fee. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:16:58
It's extremely rare that the market is volatile enough that you can't put in a limit order for even just $5-10 higher than the current asking price and run into any issues. I also highly doubt they are offering people selling bitcoin anything more than the market value in the first place. 
Edit: It's cool if people disagree with my opinion about the price being a bit steep but this has at least been informative for me since googling for reddit threads for this info led me down some wrong paths. As someone else has now pointed out, it's still cheaper to do this on Coinbase, however, I can't use Coinbase, so it's good to know this isn't as bad of a deal as I thought it was.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:36:39
People upvote anything positive for Bitcoin here, whether it's valid or not. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:21:37
This is supposed to be good for bitcoin? You think any platforms people buy Bitcoin on have fees that are as closely monitored by the wrath of federal antitrust laws?
I posted a thread about the hidden "spread" fee charged by cash app and I got mountains of text from people saying it didn't matter because it was still cheap for the services rendered. 
What a joke. I still follow this sub for the laughs so thanks. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:06:36
It's not about the price. In fact, the news tends to not affect the price too much except for during a few outlying events. People in general should strive for truth unless they're striving for satire. The issue is when people say hyperbolic things all the time that aren't based in any truth and it's meant to be taken seriously and people even downvote anyone pointing out the truth in the comments to bury reality. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:20:57
The actual spread even on that link you've sent is pretty tiny though. Of course people are always willing to sell bitcoin for more than it's worth and buy for less than it's worth but there's enough movement for a way smaller spread.
I guess it's just frustrating because on any stock trading platform be it Robinhood, ETrade, Shwab, none of them would charge even a quarter of the spread there is on Bitcoin exchanges like Cash.Me and even really on Coinbase. 
I know it isn't stocks though so we get what we get. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:14:38
Well, I am, and you're welcome to disagree. You'd be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:29:32
What kind of weird comment is this? Who would say nice car from a view like this? 
@_date: 2018-09-29 02:12:33


Except it won't be. I'm not sure how young you are but you don't seem to understand the hold big business has on our country's political balls. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:03:42
So still not as steep but I do agree with people about the benefit of having it instantly to transfer out. Wouldn't that Coinbase bitcoin be instantly transferable as well or no? Not sure why I'm being downvoted just for asking you what the premium and fee was but I appreciate you telling me for the sake of this post being as least somewhat informative. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:48:26
It's fine. No one expects anything other than shitposts here. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:35:55
Moving cash into an exchange is all that really takes time though. You can always move bitcoin in pretty quickly. If it's a real emergency just offer a good amount for the transfer. 
I'd suggest keeping cash on Binance if you want to be ready to buy Bitcoin but keeping the Bitcoin elsewhere because how long can a transfer really take for BTC?
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:22:47
A bank bailout didn't do anything to the customers. Even if a bank goes under, bank customers are insured for up to $250k by the government. Most people with more money than that keep their money in multiple accounts so as to get the full benefit of that payout should something like that ever happen.
But yes, most companies that have been bailed out have given away the money as bonuses to its higher ups. It's not generally something that helps the customers. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:24:15
I know in my case I've followed on a few accounts but also I don't enjoy coming here all that often because you tend to get buried pretty quickly for not going with the flow and chugging the coolaid

I think he just means why did they allow it to blow up instead of shutting it down before that happened. I think he's looking for a more scientific explanation as to what would cause a power plant to explode other than "mismanagement due to rising inflation" 
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:53:53
What's their premium / fee?
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:15:53
The difference between the ask and bid would be 2.6% then since the fee is on both buys and sells. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:18:14
It's also on a cryptonews site, absolutely none of which should ever be taken as anything other than a hyped up joke.

Didn't someone once try to prove they were Satoshi by moving a coin from one of the original wallets? Did this actually happen or was this just something someone claimed they could do and then found an excuse not to do?
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:23:47
Cool but he's a total pussy. The "Bitcoin Jesus" guy was obviously a crook and a moron and a schemer but Jimmy lost all of my respect at the beginning when he wouldn't just give the crazy guy the mic so he could settle his introduction like he wanted to and sent him into a whole conspiracy bro rage. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:09:33
5-10 days to move bitcoin?? I used Coinbase a long time ago and I thought I remembered it being instant transfer, as instant as it can transfer on the blockchain anyway...
What are you saying takes 5-10 days? Is that overall the time from depositing money into coinbase to buying bitcoin to moving it out or what?

Hahahahaha you think when companies get bailed out it benefits the customers?
