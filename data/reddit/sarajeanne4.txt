Oh you're cute :)
More people want to buy than who want to sell :)

Its not too late, start now. 
Besides, as you grow and age you will realize that the best things in life can't be bought. I am serious and I know this from personal experience.

My average is 111. My range is 88 to 925. I buy every month regardless of price. If I see a big dip I try to buy a little extra.

You are not out thousands, your order didn't fill. It got cancelled. Many of us were flagged as high risk, you have to get it cleared before you can buy. And I was also previously a big buyer who was flagged high risk, I got "white listed". They are a business and can flag whomever they like. You unfortunatley just had it happen at a time when the price was skyrocketting. Lesson to you, have a back up place to buy and stop spreading false info on here.

I feel your pain. But you will get your chance. Remember becoming wealthy takes periodic, repeated investing and holding on for the ride, and lastly not make snap decisions based on emotions. This is just the beginning for you. Price matters but is only one factor.

There are not extra fees to buy instantly. It comes to about 1% which is think is the normal fee for the non-instant buy. I guess I find that quite reasonable for the ease of use of the site.

SO let me get this straight, if you shopped at Target between Nov 27 and Dec 15 your card data may be compromised. The question is who DIDN'T shop at Target over the past few weeks? All of America has been compromised. Target needs to accept bitcoin to rectify this.

Holy Shit. I can't wait. I love bitcoin, I love overstock. Win.
