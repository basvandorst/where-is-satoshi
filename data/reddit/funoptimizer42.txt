Avg fee might be a more interesting metric (its currently at 21.85 sats/byte over the last 24 hours)
there are only \~5000 transactions in the mempool right now.
Look for when 1sat/byte txns no longer clear in 24 hours on most days. That's when fees are surging.

12.5 more coins will be here in about 5 minutes

Remember that the blockchain is always growing, it will likely be over 300gb in a year so plan accordingly. A dedicated 512gb HD might fill up in a few years and a 1TB HD could be useful for a decade. As long as your internet is uncapped the block download should take only a few days, and if you run the node regularly it will stay in sync with the network. The bitcoin application is relatively lightweight and not very CPU intensive so older devices should do fine.

You can trace your coins back in the block explorer to the transactions of the coins you purchased. Check the date of that block height and compare it with the price that day to validate the dollar amounts you purchased at.

You can also run a pruned node (deletes spent past transactions) which is much smaller (&lt;10gb) than the full node size. By the time the blockchain is near 1TB it would be easier just to get a 2 or 4 TB HD and move the btc. There's no need to move anything except your private keys because you can always download the same blockchain from your peers on the new device.

First halving was 50 =&gt; 25 BTC per block
Block 210,000  was at 11/28/2012, 7:24:38 AM PST
Second halving was 25 =&gt; 12.5 BTC per block
Block 420,000 was at 7/9/2016, 9:46:13 AM PDT
Third halving  will be 12.5 =&gt; 6.25 BTC per block
Block 630,00 will be in in the middle of May sometime around 28,667 blocks from now or 358,337 bitcoin mined from now (halving stats here [ )

cool website, thank you. This seems far more realistic. Do you know if there is historical data?
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:55:49
Shouldn't this read, 'thanks to bitcoin' instead? Bitcoin is monetary Batman.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:52:21
 393,187.5 BTC left to be mined before then. [

Of course! I'm certain it is still possible to send coins from a segwit address to a nonsegwit address with the right wallet. I would reseach some mobile wallets and use them temporary and test it with a small amount. The fees for a bitcoin transaction are ~$0.05-0.10 right now so I wouldn't worry about wasting bitcoin. Think of it like an investment in understanding the software and protocol. You can and should also then move the bitcoin back to your ledger wallet once the address is suitable. I'm pretty sure i've looked through the settings before, and if you create a new account in that wallet you will be asked whether its segwit or legacy, probably try that first tbh

You can also always send bitcoins to yourself. It seems a bit scary at first, especially if you've got a lot. Bitcoin is so valuable for its users because it works 100% of the time if you use it correctly. You can be sure that if you move $1,000,000 to another account in $100 transactions that all transactions will go through if you pay high enough fees (its been 1sat/byte or $0.05 per input all summer). The software broadcasts all transactions that come from any previously unspent transaction outputs, and allows you to send them to any valid bitcoin address. You don't need anything to do this but the bitcoin software, or a wallet which uses the same blockchain.
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:41:58
you can create segwit or nonsegwit addresses on the ledger nano s. I'm pretty sure you just create a new account on your already created wallet in ledger live, then specify the address type.

if you have at least 250-300gb of extra storage space and normal uncapped internet, its pretty much free. Just have to pay to power the computer. Running a node isn't CPU intensive unless you are mining.
@_date: 2019-09-20 05:08:23
haha that's an interesting point, I've heard of 65kb transactions like block 540107, but im not sure the upper limits on anything

This worked for me

Although I might have changed some config info from other tutorials

good point, their margins are probably way lower than people expect. those companies are primarily trying to earn money on transactions however, not store value. capital gains is not 15% on the dollar saved, its 15% on the dollar earned. Hence, the shop owner should be happy to pay the tax given the amount of capital gained. If most people really thought otherwise, there would be tax reform on capital gains.

Thanks!!  
here's the frontend:  [   
and the API I built from:  [ 
The project runs on bitcoin core + local server+ cloud server + front end  
still finalizing the local server to share on github (running locally now)

if people only realized that's 6.5 million bitcoins in fees ...

Any government that adopted bitcoin would immediately get the support or at least consideration of an additional 50-100 million people worldwide. The implementation of local transactions and "bitcoin banks" with full support of a government would stimulate growth of a high earning citizens with technical skills in software and web engineering in that country, transition traditional banking, and be rewarded for having a low time preference.

if you have bitcoin core, you can use the RPC API with node to get data from the blockchain. Otherwise I suggest Coindesk.com for price and [blockchain.info]( for info. I made a tutorial for the bitcoin core RPC API here  [ Its not as simple as a basic fetch request, you have to setup a server. I walked through mostly how to get an app running in node and react. That would also technically be 2 apis, because you would have the bitcoin core API and the node backend API. Feel free to message me if you try and get stuck or have questions, sounds like a fun project!

I was thinking that since 1mb legacy transactions are still available, they have a lighter footprint on the potential blockspace added they might be preferred. If lightning was massively adopted, people would be forced to use segwit transactions, validating a potential 3-4 mb block limit. This might make it easier to spam blockspace in a clever way if you could potentially figure out how get a 3.95mb block mined. I dont think lightning network is the risk or reason for this, its segwit which is necessary for lightning to work
@_date: 2019-09-20 05:04:09
This is fascinating, I only knew that transaction malleability was a potential problem, solved by SegWit and enabling lighting and other layer 2 technologies to work more efficiently. Makes a lot of sense that bitcoiners would realize this early, though I dont know how many people are aware of this. I was just surprised to see that if everyone used only lightning for bitcoin it might be possible to spam blockspace with multisig bloated witness transactions that would be 2-4x more block space than a legacy 1mb max block

Coinbase and Square Cash app are the easiest to buy coins. You won't actually own the coins yet, even though they are secure in your name. Next, you should purchase a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor (both are 60-80$, or else download a mobile wallet on your phone for smaller amounts. Theoretically Coinbase and Cash app secure your bitcoin, but they are far riskier to either get hacked or not provide trading services at times during large upward price spikes. Wallets not connected to an exchange are safer, and hardware wallets are also considered to be good long term.

18% is the lowest i've heard of. It's only gonna go down as bitcoin gets more accepted and regulated.
