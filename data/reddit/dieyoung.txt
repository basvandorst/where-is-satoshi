Man, she was literally born *today*. It's not like she would be playing with dolls or make up even if she got that as a gift anyway. It's like your grandparents or uncle or aunt or whatever getting you a savings bond before you were even born to go towards a capital accumulation, except bitcoin, gold and silver cannot be diluted by government fiat.

Very well, if you need more privacy, tails and electrum are probably the best route. Using VPNs and/or VMs may add layers to security, if thats what you're looking for.

Coinbase is awesome. Buy the bitcoin and then move it to a mycelium wallet so no one can touch it
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:06:38


Bullocks. Hash rate says otherwise
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:03:10
You don't need tails and electrum. Sign up for coinbase and buy there otherwise fees will be high
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:40:22
I guess I'll try 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:51:56
So then no wallet is bitcoin. Ok.
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:01:47
If they let you take it out of their storage, you have control of your bitcoin. Admittedly, if authorities wanted to compel coinbase to freeze your account, they could, but the bitcoin can easy be removed from their control.

That's because the decision to fork is also an economic one and not just a poll of the community. How can you say that miners have no decision in a hard fork, they can just choose to not run the software.

Unfortunately, there has never been a pure capitalist society because the well-to-do class has always used government as a bludgeon to stifle competition. However, in cases where there was very little government intervention into the market (the US until around 1930, for example) we have seen some of the highest raises in the standard of living for everyone faster than we ever have in history.

@_date: 2016-08-02 01:48:37
It's because Chinese miners did not fork like they said they would. Whether or not you agree they should, that is likely the reason for the decline.
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:35:31


I agree. Couple that with ASIC chips already reaching the 16nm limit for fabrication, I think that mining will, for a time, remain centralized, but slowly will become more and more distributed as advancements in mining chips have "hit Moore's law" as Andreas Antonopolous puts it.

Isn't a private blockchain just a database shared between parties that are can only be written to (and appended to) by them? Can't they just do this now?

Bro what the fuck? You have 300 BTC but you don't know how fees work?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:18:32
Well, if you want to make a transaction you have to pay a fee. Right now supply space in a block is limited (I have to be careful talking about this or else I will get banned), so there are many unconfirmed transactions. To bump yourself up the priority list you can pay more in transaction fees

@_date: 2015-12-22 07:41:58
Then no one would use bitcoin. People use bitcoin for the exact opposite reasons you are proposing; the hard 21 million cap is integral to  incentivize miners to mine. Diluting the currency pool through inflation would irreparably damage bitcoins reputation for predictable monetary policy.

Maybe so, but I still don't think that reflects negatively on bitcoin in general. Most of the people here, like me, are just laymen. Reddit is notorious for being unconducive to reasonable debate. Honestly, if all it took was Theymos's antics to put you off to bitcoin, maybe you weren't that into it in the first place.

@_date: 2015-12-25 05:00:49
If that were the case, it would be advantageous for one of the players in the mining cartel you suggest to actually be the only one that would mine because they would have a huge amount of market share in the mining space if all their competitors dropped out. If we assume that these miners are acting on purely selfish pretenses, it would be the smartest move to continue mining. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:38:28

@_date: 2015-12-08 18:51:31
I don't think anyone is suggesting that if bitcoin went to $1 million that they would be able to cash out $1 trillion in one lump sum. The reason why bitcointheoretically could hit $1 million is because of its economic utility and potential ubiquity in peoples lives.

Did anyone say that it's unthinkable that people would be getting into bitcoin after 2013? Obviously that isn't the case otherwise we wouldn't be having a debate whether or not to increase block sizes to accommodate all the new users.

@_date: 2016-01-25 07:33:05


Why not both?
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:55:57
Good point. Speculators were moving into ETH as a hedge against BTCs drop which, in turn, alleviated some of the drop because the capital stayed in the hyper-liquid world of crypto currencies, evidenced by the stability of the overall **market cap** of all cryptos combined. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 12:49:11
I never said that

The ironic thing is that this sarcastic comment is also contributing to the decline in discourse in this sub.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:03:47
Are you 6?
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:20:49
There are shills in here that are trying to spread FUD. There are problems with bitcoin, anyone would have to admit, but ironically that problem stems from the fact that bitcoin is becoming so popular.
There are people that are instigating and flaming threads to increase the noise and to discourage quality posters from staying in here.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:29:44


For a money, it certainly is.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:52:14
Is there a way to do RBF only with only with transfers that are, say, less than 10 cents?

Me too. I used to think that the "deflation then hyperinflation" crowd didn't know what they were talking about but now I see exactly what they meant.

Wow that's crazy

@_date: 2016-03-12 16:40:59
Same here. Bitcoin started it all but you're just too slow and it's become far too political. We want innovation at break neck speed, not squabbling about technical difficulties average users don't understand. Either it works or it doesn't and right now, bitcoin doesn't. 
This is unbridled currency competition sen, you can't handle the heat, get out the kitchen. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:57:55
Yes, main factor.

How is this sub allowed to exist? Just because they use np links? It's encouraging brigading, which is supposed to be against Reddits rules
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:44:54
In that situation then, would large miners still dominate the market do you think? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:20:18
Well, things happen for reasons, whatever they may be.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:48:42
For what reason? Just to spam? Using coin tumblers or something?
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:15:18
Kind of. The difference is that I was losing money because I was staying in bitcoin and I think that the arguing in this sub is correlated to that. The goal of the shills has already been reached; capital is leaking.  The ETH situation is a bubble, but it is the market, the users; the people the developers and miners forgot about, voicing their disapproval with the state of bitcoin with the only way they can - selling. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:44:55
If you're so cynical, why waste your time here?
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:00:29
But we need to work hand in hand with the regulators to make bitcoin more palatable to everyone, since we all know people only use bitcoin to buy drugs.

Lol no he's not his book is free online
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:54:58
Yeah, but these are really, really bad ideas. I mean, I'm seriously stunned. Black listing coins for *any* reason is antithetical to the whole point of bitcoin and opens the door for censorship and centralization. the ironic thing is that if something like this were implemented, I bet significant numbers of intelligent developers, financiers etc would be running from bitcoin as fast as they could.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:35:20
Well, a couple weeks ago, it made up 80% of the market share. Today it's at 66.5%, an all time low.  You are missing the point here

Lmao they know they can't attack the blockchain for what they really want, namely, being censorship resistant, so they have to go with their tried and true technique of feigning concern about "environmental issues" to get people on board.

Yeah? When?
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:02:37
Yet, for some reason, billions in VC money is going to companies that utilize bitcoin's blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:19:33
Maybe it won't, we can't know, but it's irrelevant either way. The point it to have principles; standards by which to gauge the heinousness of the political life. Your anger would be much better focused on the state, the apparatus of coercion and force, rather than the system that has lifted more people out of poverty than any other in history.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:26:24
But bitcoin is such a tiny market, do you think that's the main factor?
@_date: 2016-01-07 09:28:57
...tangentially, yes. I think...
@_date: 2016-01-03 03:19:57
That this will actually do what it says
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:13:45
IMHO, this was an inevitability the second they started the first QE program.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:03:50
Like who (honestly curious)?
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:27:05
Wow. I really have not kept up with things Hearn has had to say but I have to say, I am seriously floored. Are dollars thrown away if they're used in a drug deal? How is black listing a viable solution for anything other than centralization and censorship?  
As for reallocation of block rewards (!!!), can anyone else explain to me why someone that has such a high level of understanding of bitcoin would suggest something like this? Why would anyone mine any block if they knew that there was a possibility that their reward could be stripped from them? Isn't that the economic incentive that keeps bitcoin going? What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:05:09
So what exactly would your comment accomplish except to exacerbate that "douchebaggery"? I mean, seriously, this post has nothing to do with slow confirmation times or accusations of people attacking the network, you just had to shoehorn your smarmy post in here to instigate an argument about something that has nothing to do with openbazaar. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:02:12
I didn't know zcash was a private company...kinda lame

They could be, but why make a brand new account just to ask? It would seem that a more likely scenario would be people who already had accounts here that are new to bitcoin coming in here to ask.

Why would that happen?

It baffles me that these aren't huge red flags to those in the financial industry.

Don't take it out on me that this sub has singlehandedly discouraged even the most adamant supporters. Like me. All I do is talk about bitcoin, I love it. But fuck, I hate it here.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:27:33
What's wrong with that? He knows an endorsement by him would be big so he wants to seem neutral. Andreas is doing it right.
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:22:01


True, which is inherent in any area where there is a state, not because of capitalism. The fact that you understand that the Federal Reserve is a monopoly backed by force, it's odd to me that you cannot then easily conclude that what we have today must, in fact, *not* be capitalism, because it isn't. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:00:12
Lol, does anyone actually believe this shit?
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:25:05
It's not that awkward, I don't think that people who are involved in discussions think that. Also, where in that infographic did it say that bitcoin is bigger than western union? Just in daily transactions?

@_date: 2016-01-30 11:36:32


You hit the nail on the head here. Something to note is that the vast majority of USD is held *outside* of the United States. Countries that have large USD reserves will likely double down by purchasing more while simultaneously devaluing their own currencies. Not if, but when QE4 is announced and more and more central banks begin adopting a negative interest rate policy, people will come to the realization that government paper is worthless and they will be searching for another store value.
Historically that has been precious metals,  real estate etc but bitcoin is the wild card here...interesting times we are living in.
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:39:48

Erik, could you comment on Mike's suggestions in regards to blacklisting coins? I just recently found out about this and it really left an awful taste in my mouth....
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:58:07
Honestly, I have just been watching people like Marc for the past ten years or so and found channels on YouTube that post all his videos. He's on Bloomberg usually at least once a month and pretty occasionally on CNBC. I would just search his name on YouTube and sort by new to see the most relevant clips. Also, bear in mind that there are dozens of channels that repost his videos so when you search, disregard videos with 10-100 views as his videos usually hit the 10k+ range in a day or so.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:41:13
Sure, if they posted their TXID. That's not usually the case from the threads I've seen though.
@_date: 2016-01-12 23:04:33
If bitcoiners generally can understand that a monopoly on the production of money is a bad thing, why is it that some (extremely intelligent) people still think a monopoly on law is good? 
I think that if anything is going to bring down bitcoin, it's going to be the people who are clamoring to make bitcoin approachable for regulators. Bitlicense worked out well, eh?
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:57:46

That's not true. Bitcoin is hard capped, fiat can be created at will and is given to these "elite" first who enjoy that new money before it's purchasing power is diluted at that liquidity flows through the pipes.

Yeah I do actually I just don't have it 
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:36:56

Maybe the clog up of the network is just miners sending tons of transactions to trick wallets into gradually raising the fees set by the dynamic fee mechanIsm?

Not really...if you are just buying things ~$100 or less, which the vast majority of people around the world do, its way cheaper to use a debit/credit card. 
I suppose it boils down to what you think bitcoin's value proposition is: a payment network or gold 2.0
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:31:04


I can't believe it's already come to this

Is there anything I can do to RBF or something? Is there a way to manually adjust the fee?

No they didn't
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:54:26
Eh not really. It would be a big move but even if he sold 2000 BTC, the volume for bitcoin markets yesterday was around $350 million, about 380k BTC
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:01:44
I mean, really, think about this question.
First, if anyone know this for a fact, why would they tell everyone else?
Second, since no one knows what bitcoins price is going to be in the future, its probably a bad idea to ask random people on the internet for investment advice. Do your own due diligence.

Still ~10 minutes. It's based on a block of transactions the network processes every about ten minutes, but the network raises the difficulty as more processing power comes online.
The bitcoin network currently runs at [2,447,211,620 GH/s]( That's 2,447,211,620,000,000,000,000 hashes per second. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:56:46


Not necessarily. If fees are higher across the board, that is better for all miners.

It's not a shitty wallet, the bitcoin network is just extremely backed up and slow. Jaxx is an excellent wallet overall, I have no idea what you're implying when you say "it's easy to end up losing all your assets". If it's easy to lose all your assets with the Jaxx wallet then it is just as easy to lose your assets with any other wallet out there. I back up my wallet and put some in a paper wallet. Your comment is hyperbole.

Yes, they have happened throughout history, but historically, they were territorial disputes between kings who had to personally finance the wars most of time. Kings were much more wary to go to war than democratic politicians who can plunder the public coffers by promising things they could never actually deliver.
I never said there was not war before there was fiat currency because here obviously was, but what *you* fail to understand is the moral hazards baked into a political system that incentivizes lobbying for war when you have a monopoly on the production of money. The monopolistic nature of the state is a direct result of this dominance in the market of producing money. Bitcoin has the potential to dramatically alter that relationship.

You are conflating two ideas: the ECB and the EU nations. Yes, the nations have a lot to lose, but any losses the ECB incurs can be covered by printing money. The EU nations will take a huge hit if Greece defaults, I agree. The only point I was making was that since the ECB can issue credit without capital reserves, they operate differently than a private bank would in that they are not as concerned about risk because the ECB can never go bankrupt.

On the one hand, an inflationary currency can help a nation stay competitive by increasing the money supply and diluting the purchasing power of the currency, making it cheaper for foreigners to buy their goods, increasing exports. However, if a nation does not inflate and allows its currency to increase in value, the money held by the people in that country becomes more valuable and they have a better standard of living. I would argue that a deflationary currency helps the poor more than an inflationary one.

@_date: 2015-07-13 16:26:15


Is this a bad thing? If you had the choice, would you prefer to hold an asset that increases in value over time or one that decreases in value over time? The fact that bitcoin is deflationary by nature only means that the purchasing power of each unit goes up and as a result, prices fall. This then favors saving, which builds capital and creates a system where lending standards would be more strict and would help reduce recessions and volatility. The corollary would be an inflationary currency where the incentive is to spend to get the most purchasing power out of your money, which leads to malinvestment and more pronounced corrections in markets.


The market cap of bitcoin is just over $4 billion right now. As pointed out in a recent post in this sub, compare that with the bank bail outs in the US which amounted to some $700 billion. If we assume that bitcoin adoption will increase significantly over time, the price would have to far surpass $300

How did they get that money in the first place? The ECB gave them money despite the fact that they knew Greece couldn't pay it back without constantly borrowing more. There is nothing stopping the ECB from printing euros besides political whim; they can issue credit without having any capital reserves at all, unlike every other bank in the world. They have the monopoly on the production of the currency and it costs them nothing to make more. They were essentially giving Greece credit cards to pay off their other credit cards. Would a regular bank constantly issue someone credit when they were already negligent on past payments? Of course not because they would be exposed to risk. Central banks do not have that concern.
It's a fact that Greece was completely irresponsible with their finances, but the ECB kept loaning them money for this exact reason. They now have the *political* capital to seize Greek assets and auction them of to their friends at Goldman Sachs.

Why is the ECB constantly giving them more and more loans? If they are so irresponsible with their money, why is the response from the EU *always* to just throw more money at the situation? You said it yourself, Greece will never pay back it's debts and everyone knows it, it's no secret. Everyone knows that if they get this money, they'll be back in the same situation soon enough, so why constantly loan money to pay back previously loaned money they can't pay back?
The answer is because the ECB does not have to put any real capital or assets at risk. They can print as much money as they please and if things go wrong, well, they can just print more. It's all central bankers know. They pretend they are incompetent but they know *exactly* what they are doing.
@_date: 2015-07-19 02:04:47
No, you can break through a trading range, which will still be in an uptrend, and then have a correction bank to the 50 or 200 day moving averages, for example. Since inception, the trend has been consistently up, but there have been corrections. That does not change the upward trend.
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:32:33
That's bullshit. It's not like it was a surprise the Greeks were irresponsible.

This is what happens when there is a monopoly on the production of money and only some are cut in on the deal. The elite banking cartel uses newly printed fiat to paper over losses and buy real assets.

It's all a shell game and the way they try to make it seem legitimate. Governments issue sovereign debt which central banks buy with *newly created money* which increases the monetary base. The bond matures and the central bank is reimbursed by the issuing government with revenue it receives from taxes. Really, the central bank takes no risk and fleeces the population for potentially trillions while simultaneously taking purchasing power away from everyone who uses their paper. 
Central banks are truly the bane of civilisation today.

It is anarcho-capitalist in nature and completely antithetical to socialism. Bitcoin is the first free market money since gold, imho, one of if not *the* most important variables to an ancap universe. 
The problem with socialism is that there are dozens of different variations and it is extremely difficult to figuring out what principles the socialist in question stands for. Public ownership of the means of production? Should there be private property at all?

I never understood the hate for coinbase. Yes, they hold your keys. Yes, there are anecdotes where people have had their accounts frozen. These are problems but overall, coinbase is, IMHO, an essential stepping stone to make the transition from fiat to crypto more smooth for the average Joe.

Not only could they, but banking with bitcoin would *have* to have some type of fraction reserves to make loans, though a ten percent standard like we have in the U.S. today would never be possible. Something like a 90% reserve would be more like it, although the market would dictate reserve ratios. I think that would even be a marketing ploy for bitcoin banking, ie advertising a higher reserve rate than their competitors to demonstrate solvency and be more appealing to customers
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:51:15

It's obvious CW went to GA because of his credibility and stature in the community. This needs to be reevaluated in light of recent events.
I really respect Gavin and all he's done for bitcoin but saying that CW was Satoshi "beyond a reasonable doubt" when there clearly was reasonable doubt throws his credibility into question. This is to avoid people appealing to authority in the future for changes in the protocol, people claiming to be Satoshi or whatever the reason.

Yeah it's just a ballpark figure
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:01:18
Why is it "obviously" not sustainable?  There has been over a billion dollars worth of investment into bitcoin and blockchain start ups while the price has stayed relatively stable for most of the year. There will be a correction but who knows from what peak and to what extent it will fall? This could be a leg up in an overall bull market but you really have no way to know it's going to be at $300 in a month. DYODD

Lol the amount of gold mined is well known, what are you on about?
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:51:26
Greater than 90%? How could you possibly quantify anything like that? How can you expect anyone to take you seriously when you make such ridiculous hyperbolic statements ?

Fuck man I read this exact comment in so many threads on Reddit. So cliche.
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:31:21


This is certainly valid. Same goes for silver. The reason why it "matters" is because, whether or not numbers for aboveground gold and/or silver are legitimate, they are still used by the market for price discovery in the metals. 
I agree with you, you make great points. the amount of aboveground silver and gold is likely much different than official statistics say, but those official statistics are the basis for basic supply and demand fundamentals. Whether they are wrong or not is inconsequential in this regard, but the number is meaningful in so far as its function as a variable in the price.
Also, don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin and crypto in general. Since 2013 I stopped accumulating gold and silver and started accumulating bitcoin.

Lol as if everyone here isn't buying bitcoin to try to make a profit. Pot, kettle, black etc.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:47:40
exactly. why do people hate and say 'oh, only idiots would buy X-coin'. Well, if its as easy and basically fee-free to transfer cryptos around, why not try to make some more and not just sit on one forever. BTC means it has to go to 2000 to have a 100% return. Some of these other ones (which probably are just scams) are moving up that much in a day. Whats the problem getting in and getting back out so you can cash in for some more btc?
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:00:40
Programmatically. Economically it's still vulnerable.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:12:58


Seems pretty simple to me.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:28:19
The market cap is over 50% of bitcoin's. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:02:29


And pretty much everyone agrees that it's clear how much bitcoin is surrendering market share.

@_date: 2013-12-03 23:09:35
But if you can use the scam coins to get more bitcoins what's the issue? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:17:24
Sounds like there's something missing to this story
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:26:13
Which would make them even more of a threat. If those millions of bitcoins are lost, the top 100 actually hold more than only 20%.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:51:10
....I'll freak out because I don't know what to say
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:38:00
Yes, I'd like to to see that as well

Why would you say that in r/bitcoin when he is literally advocating it. Shut up
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:52:50
Not that much more....we all know the problems with fiat money which is why I think the majority of us are in here. The problem is that the bitcoin market cap is less than 0.01% of the market cap of all USD denominated assets in the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:37
Right, which is what I want to do as well. That's what I'm most excited about BTC; lack of capital controls. I want some, but I want them *now*, not in a week. The problem is to switch monetary systems, you have to jump through a lot of hoops that could deter people who were initially interested. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:46:23
Is that his problem that coinbase isn't reliable? Why would they even have the instant verification method on there if there was such a possibility for fraud? They deserve any scrutiny they get for not having a secure method to deposit money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:09:17
Lol seriously. If bitcoin can be infiltrated and torn down from the inside **by two people**, bitcoin deserves to die
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:51:02

I've been watching keiser since before on the edge started and he has consistently gotten crazier. He's a smart guy but he's starting to sound like Alex Jones.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:31:47
I'm waiting for mine. I only bought a tiny bit so that I have the instant buy option available. Question,  now that you have the bitcoins, is coinbase letting you instant buy? I remember seeing a video that said I still have to wait 30 days after my first purchase goes through until I can buy them immediately, but I know they change their rules often. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:15:08
Good point, is there anyway to check something like that out?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:06:19
I'm not sure, how do you find something like that out? I kinda posted this for someone to post a good rebuttal, I'm open to anything, just critically thinking
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:08:18
Well I'm buying them first for speculation and then for their actually value as a new decentralized currency. Right now though, btc is so volatile that you can expect more people to come in for the speculative buy than to buy and hold. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:52:01
Ron Paul should have been president.

@_date: 2013-12-05 00:15:20
I'm sorry but people who are surprised by this (not OP) are seriously clueless. The whole system is set up like this, this is standard operating procedure. Routine. Dudes in the libor offices calling each other and cutting deals that get banks billions in profit for lunch the next day. It's absolutely abhorrent, we need something like bitcoin. I think that most people in here mostly know this just had to /rant
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:43:35
That has very limited acceptability.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:21:41
I don't think it's irrelevant
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:42:07


I didn't say it was hard to buy things with BTC, I said it was hard to GET them. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:11:49


That's a little presumptuous. Yes, most probably are pump and dumps but who knows if there will be another coin with a better architecture that will be even better than bitcoin? Or will trade alongside?

So the top one is owned by the justice department?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:48:14
I would argue that human instinct would do exactly that (selling them at a high price)
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:36:51
Thanks. I thought coinbase was a wallet too (sorry I'm dumb).  How is blockchain? Do i have to download the app on bitcoin.org?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:15:07
Well of course you're not going to sell it all in one shot, you'll freak the market out and get less money for yourself. What you said is probably what would happen; the owners of the addresses would likely cash out a little at a time, selling high and buying low to accommodate more. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:06:08
I'll have to check that out, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:27:46
That's a cop out. I'm not asking you to prove a negative.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:41:53
Why can they only sell once? That could have a big sell off, keep half or so, get the cash, force a market correction, and then use the profits they just got to buy even more than they had before.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:54:01
Can you expand on this? Who's DPR?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:08:43
I understand that it is the monetary system that is the problem, that's the main reason I want bitcoins in the first place. The problem, I think more specifically, is that people can't get them because of the lack of capacity by exchanges to handle large volumes of orders. Some people would be turned off by the lack of customer service and slow times to make initial orders. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:09:04


I think that's the real problem. We all know about the problem with government regulations and infinite money, which is why most of us are probably here in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:22:11
Well said. I think that most people here understand the threat that bitcoin is to the monetary powers that be and it is clear they will use any means they have to choke it out. I've heard Jeff Berwick talk about how when he was initially going to invest in the BTC ATM, he would have been under 5 different regulatory boards, including the SEC, where, to be registered as a money transmitter, would have to have at least a $25 million insurance bond. I definitely can see if this was a free market, this problem would have been solved long ago.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:47:12
He was talking about competing currencies before you were likely born.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:34:05
On the list I posted, all top 100 had a transaction either today or yesterday
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:12:09
Interesting....I wonder what that could mean....
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:43:45
Where's the character for a bitcoin symbol?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:24:13
Why not? There's money to be made and you can buy a lot less shit with bitcoins than you can with USD 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:58:03
I agree with you 100%. But watching them daily, or even setting up an buy stop algorithm for these scam currencies could still rake in more money for you. They are only good for the people who profit, but they may be really, really good. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:35:53
Right, so technically, one guy could actually hold multiple addresses in the top 100. I just posted the list if you want to check it out. All addresses had transactions either today or yesterday.
