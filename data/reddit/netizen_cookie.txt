Certainly that could be seen as an admirable thing to do. But to me, the problem is that people are looking to states to solve problems at all. And ironically, the problems people want states to solve are almost always state-created problems to begin with!
So this whole "stand with Rand" thing -- or any politician for that matter -- strikes me as taking one step forward and three steps back.
Certainly we're capable of solving our own problems. Certainly the problem of trust -- which blockchains have made so clear to us -- are maximized 100-fold when people place trust over their infrastructure, healthcare, education, and defense into the hands of a small and nearly-unaccountable group of strangers.
What do you think?

The only thing I would miss is the points system--that is, reputation points for making highly upvoted posts or comments. But perhaps the benefits of decentralization outweigh that particular perk.

Much easier to understand than the pegged sidechains whitepaper, to be sure.
Though I am wary of anything that purports to remove "effort and risk," as this article claims. It seems as though sidechains want to make all other coins into extensions of Bitcoin. I don't see how that's a good idea, though I'm open to being convinced.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies are still a free market. I guess I would just switch to using altcoins that didn't act as extensions of Bitcoin if I wanted to avoid being a participant in the "maximalization" of one single cryptocurrency.

Not "fought". Ignored. A fight gives them more legitimacy and power. Ignoring them does the opposite. Fenton is right.
Edit: Confession: did not read the entire article before I made that comment. I did just now, and I fear I've made an ass of myself. I no longer think Fenton is right, due to his call for further negotiations with a monopoly entity that destroys wealth in the way that Bitcoin creates it.

What is shocking to me is that so many people will see this as a need for more government regulation.
Because, you know, forget *market* regulation, in which these fraudster fucks would have lost their hats long ago when consumers refused to deal with them.

Righteous! I had heard of "prediction markets" but never actually knew what they were. Seems like Bitcoin would make such a thing pretty frictionless.

Nothing yet. Bitcoin is not yet enabled, even on Braintree. I called PayPal myself this morning to find out.

@_date: 2014-07-26 17:47:40
Actually, there is. There is a very powerful force that currently keeps Bitcoin exchanges from seizing your money. It's called the market, and that's why the vast majority of them don't and won't.
"Regulations", however, would make it easier for them to start doing such things, because they'd be propped up by bureaucrats, not customers.
Remember that the banks which have destroyed the majority of the world's wealth were all "regulated".

I just called PayPal. They told me that Bitcoin is not yet launched on ANY of their services, including Braintree. So it sounds like in all the excitement of their announcements of *future* partnerships with Bitpay, many of us (myself included) believed that it was already functional. It's not.

From RT? Does anyone else find it odd that the nation-state rulers that have banned Bitcoin are also funding publications that promote its use?
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:32:35
I was trying to figure that out myself. It says that the app records the distance you've traveled via your GPS. With meta coins like this, are miners needed to cryptographically secure the blockchain - does the app do that as you drive? Or is it already secured because the meta coins are hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain? I have a gap in technical knowledge here.

What a great question! And yes, I have a fantasy app: it's a fusion of Waze's GPS, online dating's compatibility functions and an exchange platform.
Let me paint the picture: I want to trade currency/crypto tokens. I could stay behind my computer and do it online (and possibly compromise my privacy if I'm linking a bank account), OR I could get out and meet some new like-minded friends and do a P2P trade.
I want to look at a Waze-like map and see who within an x-mile radius is compatible with my buy/sell order. I foresee this prompting a real-life, real-time open bazaar.
Such an app would come into high use when crypto is more widely adopted (or just in highly-concentrated crypto areas like SF), but I see it as a great way to meet new friends AND make private trades.

If you always do what the government employees command you to do, then Bitcoin can never fulfill its promise. Cryptocurrency is premised on permissionless innovation.

As an avowed anarchist, I've also begun to strive to divorce all my discussions about Bitcoin from political rhetoric. In fact, I've been trying to eliminate political rhetoric from my life entirely.

Democracies facilitate all manners of evil. People often forget that everything that was done in Nazi Germany was completely legal. It was democratic.
Top-down systems of law, like democracy, will always lead to tyranny. You don't have to have a monopoly provider of law to have laws, just like you don't need a monopoly provider of shoes to have shoes.

Even if it were "federal," it would still be "privately owned." Ownership is private, by definition. The only difference is that the state simply steals the property it wishes to own, and then lulls you into thinking that it's yours, too--that the property is actually "public."
There's no such thing as public property.

Wikipedia blows. If Bitcoiners want curious individuals to have a place to learn about Antonopoulos, we should host our own wiki about him (which we already have about all things Bitcoin, anyway). 
I myself personally submitted mention of the Surgery Center of Oklahoma once to Wikipedia's Oklahoma City page. That there was no mention made of the city's fastest-growing, most-talked-about medical facility was surprising to me. My simple two sentences were taken down within an hour for being "self-promotional" - as though I worked there or something? 
In short, Wikipedia is not revolution-friendly. They're mired in established paradigms.

I buy from Overstock and Gyft probably once a month each, and I also pay my rent in BTC.

The creation of a brain wallet seems like the most obvious answer to me. If you can memorize a strong passphrase - provided that Bitcoin is still valuable and intact when you get out of a cage - everything you need to access your money will be in your mind and ready to go.
Also, if you seriously hurt a person or their property, that's one thing. But if you committed a victimless crime (a.k.a. not a real crime at all), permit me to urge you to run.

From the article: ". . . without the threat of violence. . . he [Lawsky] would have no standing in this space and most Bitcoin people would have never even heard of him."
Also: [Lawsky] "has shown no intention to operate honestly or with reason or the most basic logic."
As though "elected" politicians *don't* threaten violence? As though "elected" politicians operate honestly and logically? 
Can Fenton be serious when he goes on to encourage that even *more* earned resources be wasted on further political pursuits?
What about the remittances market? The Bitcoin Lady in Botswana? Tech-hungry high school kids? The unbanked? These people need and want Bitcoin, but how many of them have even heard of it?

I will not do business with any Bitcoin company that takes orders from the people who call themselves "New York". If a Bitcoin company is more interested in serving Ben Lawsky than they are in serving me, I don't need to give them my business. I would encourage all others to do the same. There is not a shortage of exchanges and wallets to choose from, and more will crop up as we direct our business to entrepreneurs who also oppose fascism.

Yes, property lines are real and borders are silly. Exactly. Property lines demarcate the difference between assets that are legitimately owned by individuals.

Fair enough. But I'm talking about legitimate transactions, like the one I made 5 hours ago with the standard transaction fee (I wasn't aware at the time that I needed to increase it) that still has no confirmations.

@_date: 2015-07-08 03:11:17
A little price discovery goes a long way. I sent a transaction seven hours ago -- before I knew about the spam attack -- and so I still have no confirmations, as my "standard transaction fee" wasn't enough.
But if I had had a mechanism of determining the CURRENT PRICE OF A TRANSACTION, this problem could have been entirely avoided. I would have gladly paid a little more while the demand for processing resources was high. Or I would have waited a day or two until the demand for resources was lower.
Supply and demand would and could do wonders for Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as "intrinsic" value. 
Value is, by definition, subjective. If enough people value something as a currency -- if it has excellent properties like scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, and portability -- it will likely be valued as a currency.
Bitcoin has value as a currency because people recognize that it has those properties. Sometimes the recognition has been less -- like when Bitcoin was $1. And sometimes the recognition has been more -- like when Bitcoin was $1100.
"Intrinsic" value theory is nonsense.

Premined? You must be thinking of Ethereum. Dash had no premine. There was an accidental 'insta-mine' within the 24 hours that turned out to work out great for them in that the founders have stayed on the project for nearly 3 years with no signs of leaving, because they've just been working to increase the value of their own savings. Dash's tech is lightyears ahead of its competitors and investors are slowly, slowly figuring that out, as evidenced by the price charts.

I am also highly annoyed whenever I spend Bitcoin and find out that the merchant only accepts through Coinbase.
Get this -- I ordered something from Overstock once, and had to send it back for a refund. Coinbase wouldn't just send my refund to the address I paid from -- or kindly ask me where I wanted the refund sent -- nope. I had to create a fuggin Coinbase account -- and sign their little legal document with a "legal name" and everything -- just to get the refund.
Coinbase will fall by the wayside soon enough methinks, though. I hope you get your gift card soon.

LOL, clearly no one is interested in entertaining the real concerns you've brought up. They'd rather just dismiss them with snide comments.
I myself can think of no way that Bitcoin can scale that doesn't involve direct payments made among users, nodes, and miners. Only then can the supply of transaction processing resources and transaction demand meet in the middle: supply meeting demand. Block size "caps" completely ignore supply and demand, which is why they're wholly unsuitable for unpredictable surges (or drops) in demand for Bitcoin network usage.
It seems like transaction pricing wouldn't even need to involve hardcoded protocol changes, other than the removal of the blocksize cap. Wallet software would need only to inform users of the pricing options for available nodes and miners. P2P payments simply incorporated into the world's most popular P2P payment system.

It employes more than one logical fallacy, and relies heavily on the concept of the "collective," which doesn't actually exist except for in reference to multiple individuals.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:02:49
For me, a primary personal benefit is that I can (and sometimes do) live in various places around the world, and it's not a problem that I can't get a bank account in those places. 
I either sell my Bitcoin for cash -- or ideally -- just shop at stores and rent at buildings that accept Bitcoin.
I also don't have to worry that a bank with all my money in it will shut down, or skim off a part of my deposit to "bail" themselves in.
And lest I forget -- it's so instant and unblockable. I don't have to worry that PayPal will "freeze" my account, or that a bank transfer will take an extra friggin' day because it's a stupid holiday weekend or something.
Furthermore, I'm just attracted to a money that got its value from individuals freely choosing it (Bitcoin) versus laws saying "you must use this money: it's 'legal tender'" (all goverment money). I want to use a money that reflects my personality and values, just like I collect movies, music, friends, and shoes which reflect my personality and values.

Why not adopt Dash's approach of giving nodes part of the block reward?? Check out Dash's masternode scheme to see how they do it -- masternodes have to put up collateral and everything. They also serve as coin mixing hubs. It's a pretty good idea.
Haven't Bitcoiners been calling "altcoins" the "lab experiments" of crypto for years, saying they'd adopt whatever goodness came out of the experiments?
It seems to be going the other way around, though. Altcoin developers watch what goes wrong in Bitcoin, and then quickly code a solution that prevents the same thing from happening in their own coin.

Value is assigned by the individual. I may place great value on caviar because I think it is delicious and salty and the perfect texture. I would pay $20 a plate for it.
You may feel the opposite, and might even be willing to pay $20 to NEVER have to eat or smell it.
Bitcoin is as valuable to you as you sense it to be. The Bitcoin "price" is the aggregate of the individual valuations of millions of people all over the world. This is the same for everything -- the price of a pickle, a car, a pair of shoes, and yes -- even the USD.
People used to value the USD much more than they do now. Just think -- less than 100 years ago, a few hundred dollars could get you a brand new car. No kidding! And a penny could get you a delicious piece of candy (hence the term "penny candy").
But people value them much less now because so many of them got printed. Bitcoin aims to avoid that problem by capping its production at 21 million coins. 
And if you're Suzanne, hello. :)

Huh. . . kind of makes one wonder at the true motivations of those who want to force businesses to collect unnecessary customer data. . .

An accurate parallel.

Interesting. Thanks for the insight.

Thank you to those who described the problem to me: that I had an unconfirmed input.
The unconfirmed input -- incidentally -- was from another transaction that I sent an hour before which didn't get confirmed because my tx fee was only 0.0001, I'd guess. So hard to know the right fee to send. Impossible, really.
Thanks again for the helpful information.

I wasn't aware of anyone making a fuss about OpenBazaar. As of now, it's still vaporware.
If you use OSX, however, there is a non-vaporeware OpenBazaar alternative called [Bitmarkets]( which I believe is working. Heard about it on the monthly podcast/video series [Decentralize]( which I recommend.

"Asshole"? Way to talk about a potential investor.

The results of all legislation can be pretty easily and quickly predicted by just flipping the title. A "privacy bill of rights" will, undoubtedly, be anti-privacy. 
The "Federal Reserve" has no reserves, the "food and drug administration" peddles poisonous non-food items and bans healthy drugs, and the "defense department" conducts solely OFFensive operations.
It's not difficult.

Ohh, excellent, thank you!
