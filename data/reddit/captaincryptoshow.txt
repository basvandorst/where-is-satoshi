Oh look... another dumb meme.

I don't think this is a good idea. You guys are welcome to throw your own money at it, though.People who are not familiar with Bitcoin will have no idea what the number means... and the number will only change every ~10 minutes or so.

Used to get scammed out of 100% of my crypto by the darknet markets and vendors back in the day so as long as I still have a significant portion of my value still intact then I'm not too phased.

After the late-2013 crash this all became more of a ride and less of a destination. Sure it hurts but many of us know that patience will be rewarded.

I'm assuming it was mined by Satoshi himself? Or are people not 100% sure?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:56:24
That's a quote from the white paper, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:23:47
That's a bit of a superlative. It depends how much money they have and what portion they'd consider putting into crypto.

I really hope this meme / post was made in jest. Kanye's thoughts, and this quote, are incoherent.

But plenty of applications and exchanges do not support it... at least for now.

So much this.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:01:39
I'm sorry but it's not always "little effort". Some wallets have been designed to only hold one currency and now they are having to consider develop a UI that supports multiple currencies. Either that or get their users to start doing stuff from the command line (which most users are not knowledgeable enough to do).  
Although I suppose in technical terms the same private keys that have BTC now have BCH. So *that* part of the network is essentially the same for now.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:01:57
Fair point, though the two are related. Usability has always seemed like the biggest barrier to entry for new users.
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:44:34
Wouldn't they still know where your bank account is located? Or does BitFinex only do crypto-to-crypto?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:35:01
Yeah market cap is a wonky comparison. Last time I checked PayPal was getting like an order of magnitude or two more transactions per second than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:33:48
Much of this sub's early growth from literally from that. But no, smart people don't use BTC to buy drugs because its privacy is questionable, at best.

That's a difference in degree. I *will* agree that Ethereum seems to attract a certain type of brazen developer / investor.

Shameless plug!  I made an episode specifically going over the process of purchasing cryptocurrency:  
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:00:58
What is the relevance of this stat comparison? Of course Bitcoin has always had much higher volume than BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:20:57
I have a feeling you would see a flood of new non-Chinese mining pools. I have acquaintances looking to set up shop in Ukraine as things stand anyway, so if Chinese mining got banned I know these people would ramp up their efforts that much more.  
Not justifying any banning though. Just curious.

You can either go through their verification process or use LocalBitcoins.com. You can also use multiple exchanges (Glidera, sFox?).

I'm a huge UFC fan and this was one of the best animated GIFs I've ever seen in the sub. There is a similar one for McGregor vs. Alvarez out there as well. Always a pleasure seeing two of my interests overlap!

Yeah I'm not sure Monero is trying to scale as much as Bitcoin. Most Monero users aren't trying to buy coffee with XMR, for example. I *will* say, though, that if Ethereum can get its sharding solution to work then that may become the new gold standard for scaling.  
Anyway time will tell!

OMG the corporate overlords win again!

I wonder if their announcement that they'd be adding a call line has affected anything.  
Also, I hope they're paying those customer support reps a lot.

It's alright, they have the Bolivar Fuerte now... it has the Spanish word for "strong" in it so it's MUCH better now!

That's hilarious if there really is only one. Most difficult job in America right there.

This is what I want to know. I do not believe they were banned... they'll just have to get creative in how they cash out (to pay for bills, etc.). I'm hoping that this move has the silver lining of making non-Chinese mining operations more viable.

So where do I find the function to produce the checksum based on the previous 11?

Yeah at this point I've almost divested all of my BTC *and* BCH. It's not the fastest, not the most programmable, not the most decentralized (especially once LN comes into play), and not the most private.  
All it's got going for it now is network effect / first-mover.

Um... can't you just flip it about the y-axis? You guys are hilarious.

Thank you for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:42:02
I don't fully understand why the debate is going on. Is it because there is resistance to the 2x change?
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:03:46
Monero is the one that comes to mind for me. It's even fairly ASIC resistant (at least for the time being).
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:02:12
When is this "soon" you're talking about. Would love to hear your prediction.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:23:37
Yeah a lot of people seem to think that a currency has to be backed by something tangible but in reality it does not. People pay money to listen to music, to download software, for sex acts, and for all sorts of either intangible or fairly intangible things.  
And as mentioned, if you think something is without value but others value it then you immediately realize you can trade it to those people for something of value... that gives it value to you as well.  
The first supposed Bitcoin transaction was done for a pizza which means that someone was willing to give up the money for a pizza in order to experiment with this new / novel currency. Experiences are more or less intangible and they absolutely have value to us.  
Tangibility is a arbitrary litmus test.

Why is everyone (on both sides) so obsessed with comparing themselves to the other side? It's like someone bragging that they have a better car than their ex's new boyfriend. Grow up, guys.

They want to re-define terms to make them feel better about the future. The truth is that we don't know how successful BCC will be, the same way very few people were right about ETC.

@_date: 2017-07-29 00:28:23
Yeah that's what actually fascinates me more. It was the first assertion by anyone but the creator that it may be viable and of significant value. Until then it would have been very difficult to gauge the value. Some adventurous user took a leap of faith and we're better off for it (not saying that no one would have eventually done it, just that this person was first).
