No, unfortunately this year you will have to attend to participate.  We thought about ways to involve individuals who could not make the trip but decided that since it's the first one we really wanted to focus on involving and highlighting the local tech community.  Next year we plan to have a prize category that is open to everyone with a different set of rules.  Thanks for your interest!

Thanks for the suggestion. We'll switch it up to show the amount of BTC won @ the current exchange rate for the USD allotted prize amount.  It would be nice for the uninitiated to see that 10k usd fait is a fat 31.5 bitcoin.

We're going to have a mixer event on Friday night and we encourage you to come by as I'm sure there will be other people looking for teammates.  As the event approaches, all registered contestants will receive access to a contestant dashboard where you will be able to flag yourself as looking for team.

Hi and thanks for your interest.  Blockchain Beach is a non profit started in Miami earlier this year which aims to bring a consistent flow of Bitcoin information and knowledge to the South Florida area.  Our first event was the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon.  The event on 3/3 is a presentation that is specifically tailored to merchants &amp; businesses to try and show them what Bitcoin is all about and how it could possibly benefit their business.  It will be a 30 min presentation followed by a mixer where there will be people knowledgable about Bitcoin to answer any questions and have more engaged conversations.  Hope this answers all your questions.
