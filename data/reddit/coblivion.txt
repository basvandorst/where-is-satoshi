Probably the best article out there. Who is to guarantee that another Mark Karpeles does not work at Bitstamp or BTC-E and the other exchanges? Most of the exchanges could have complete crooks behind them and everybody is in denial....

I have come to believe that the simplest explanation for the Mt. Gox disaster is the right one: Mark Karpeles was embezzling from his exchange from the moment he took over. The missing $450 million to 1 billion BTC has likely been cashed out and deposited in all kinds of fiat all over the world. Mark Karpeles is a pathological character and nobody could believe he was that bad...and everyone was monumentally ripped off..... just like the Bernie Madoff situation. .

I am sorry but I think it looks like Gox had a point. There is technical problem with the Bitcoin code that makes all the exchanges vulnerable... not just Gox! Everyone said it was all Goxes fault for their issues with transaction malleability, but now it turns out the the other exchanges have vulnerabilities because of this  problem with Bitcoin. Yes Bitcoin! It will be fixed and Bitcoin is still going to survive, but everyone should realize that they were being  really unfair to Gox!

This is a really big deal. The problem with malleability of transaction data has been known for a long time. It wasn't fully addressed, and now the whole community has a real crisis on its hands. Bitcoin will survive but everybody is going to have to stay calm, do not sell no matter what happens and stay positive about the potential of Bitcoin.. but if doom and gloom takes over, that is the real threat...

Wake up call to half the Bitcoin community: in the words of Jack Nicholson,"You can't handle the truth!" All this absurd fantasy about Gag Orders and cold storage leaks, and mysterious hacks, and transaction malleability is all the smoke screen/cover of a pure criminal. Wake up! Mark Karpeles was embezzling BTC from the beginning.. he has been cashing out in many many transactions to hide has tracks.. it was all a massive Madoff Scheme... it is obvious that this is the truth: 800K BTC does not go missing, it is not hacked,it is not lost.... Mark Karpeles STOLE IT DELIBERATELY... YOU PEOPLE CAN'T FACE THAT HE IS A PATHOLOGICAL CRIMINAL.. those people can appear to be "nice guys" again... WAKE UP!
