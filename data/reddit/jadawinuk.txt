I'm expecting a rise to above 450 Euros / 600 USD and then it probably will go down again because of people trying to secure "profits". It will take another two years at least to really "explode", because all the legal stuff that's in the air now will be sorted by then.

Sorry, but once people know what Bitcoins are, "bits" will sound perfectly normal to them. It's also descriptive of what is is... small parts of something bigger - one Bitcoin.
Asking "non-bitcoin" friends about their opinion about "bits" is like asking someone with no computer knowledge at all about their opinion about "discs". Lots of different discs everywhere. And no one is confused once they know about a CERTAIN disc and its meaning. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:21:07
Digital CC won't be the only company acting like that, that's why expect 1 BTC to be back at 600 USD / 470 Euros around December 2014/January 2015.
And if the history of other "assets" like Gold is to be repeated, the price will then go down a bit (due to the sellers), hover around 500 USD for around a year due to selling/buying cancelling each other out, drop to 250 USD at early/middle 2016 because a lot of HODLers and miners will give up, each other driving the price down... and then the buyers will initialize a rise to a new all time high eary 2017.
At least that is what you get when you superimpose a time compressed gold chart from 1970 to 2011 over the BTC charts. Gold from 1970 to around 1985 looks eerily similar to BTC from the start to now. And if BTC follows this course, it will be a tough 2-3 years for HODLers.
All this could be stupid crap though, by selecting a fitting gold chart :) Gold didn't move for 100 years - but this is the 21st century and everything is faster.
 (Don't ask how often I wrote GODL instead of Gold).

I've bought hardware (had to replace dead components) with BTC when the price was around 600 USD and my BTC were worth more than I paid for them. Had no fiat left to pay that much.

To me, altcoins are like the "UI enhancements" that a lot of smartphone producers put on top of Android. Or like modified "Custom ROMs" of Android. Most of them are crap, some of them actually have interesting features - which find their way into Android at some point. So if altcoins will improve Bitcoin, fine. But I doubt that a huge amount of altcoins will help to convince people to use any of them, it's just confusing. So from that point of view, altcoins may actually be hurting the adoption of decentralized digital money. Decentralized must not mean "chaos".

It's reasonable to expect to lose all your money you put into Bitcoin. That doesn't mean it won't be worth $10K in 5-6 years, but the only reasonable expectation with a volatile financial speculation is to lose your investment and act carefully.

The problem starts here: " I have lost more than 2 year's worth of salary on bitcoin this year". That's only true if you sold your BTC and only if you sold them for less than you bought them for. Otherwise, it's a theoretical "paper" loss and that happens to shares or gold or whatever else, too. If you are spending as much as you can on Bitcoin without endangering payments for food, utilities, rent etc, then this is just risky. 
But people who are addicted to gambling will start spending all their money and stop paying their bills in the hope of winning everything back, probably even making debts to keep on gambling.
So there's a difference, I'd say. Only you know how much of your available money you can spend on Bitcoin without f-ing up your life. If you pay all bills you need to pay and then invest the rest - fine. Risky, but no addiction.

I don't think it will be the downfall of fiat currency. But I think it will at some point become a major way of transferring value globally. That requires that BTC has to have a value in fiat currency that makes huge value transfers possible.
A lot of people here including me can be steadfast  because they said Goodbye to the money they invested in BTC and don't need that money to pay for anything. A problem only occurs if people put in money they WILL need hoping the price will rise and not fall. But that's gambling.

The video doesn't even say "currency", it says they will "randomly" accept a new type of "payment". To me that sounds like a PR thing where they randomly don't want money for an order, but want the customer to smile or tell a joke or whatever.
Just the "randomly" gives it away that it can't be about a new currency. You can't tell customers 'Yes, sometimes we accept Ronaldscoins, but sometimes we won't'". And the fine print says "no purchase or order necessary". So... no.
There is not a satoshi worth of Bitcoin in the whole thing and even the answer on Twitter just says it will be worth the wait.

You are making a logical mistake. Everything is good news, but not for everybody.
High prices are great for people who bought cheap and want to sell, but bad for people who want to buy.
Stable is great for the ecosystem around Bitcoin and real world usage, but not so good for people wanting to buy and sell at a profit.
Dropping is a nightmare for people who actually need the money they put into bitcoin in the near future, but great for those who wanted to buy more BTC anyway.
That's why you will have "that's great" posts whatever happens - as long as there is Bitcoin.

You know, cars will never be used much, they stink, they are noisy. Good old horse carriages are just cheaper and simpler and are used everywhere. And if cars would be used a lot, the government would step in. So why use cars at all?

You know that joke: a pope dies and goes straight up to heaven. Saint Peter welcomes him and tells him to wait. Then he comes back with a sandwich. The pope has looked around and down and in hell, there is a huge feast going on with all kinds of (hot) dishes. Well, a few hours later, Saint Peter turns up again - with a sandwich for the pope. This goes on for a few times and then the pope asks: I really like those sandwiches, but down in hell they have all kinds of food all the time. Why are there only sandwiches in heaven? Saint Peter looks at the pope and says: "Well, it's too much work to cook for one person".
Who would I pay with BTC in heaven when there is nobody else?

It's always funny that optimism and desperation basically occur at the same value. I'd say we are at the panic stage, so that's the same as hope.

Which is weird, because BTC/EUR seems to be stuck at the same level for the last 24h.
Edit: Apparently only at bitcoin.de. BTC-e shows the same rise in EUR and USD.

Nope. I meant that your requirement for rational reasons to support a "believe" (in anything) doesn't make sense. Rational reasons support logic, not "believes". Believes need faith, not logic.
And the rest of my post was about what I see as a probable future of bitcoin.

If enough people are in denial and start buying, the price will go up again - and then they weren't in denial, but right. I wish I could have hindsight upfront.

You forgot to add a bit "at the moment" in your analysis. BTC could go down below 20 USD and the Winklevoss would have lost money. It could go to above 700 USD and Tim Draper would have a profit.
The main thing is that profits or losses are only real the moment your investment stops existing and therefore has zero value - or if you sell. Otherwise, it's just "if I or they would sell right now".
I can afford to lose my complete investment in BTC, so I will never have a reason to sell at a loss. And I have time to sit it out for decades if necessary.
Investing money you really need and can't afford to lose is stupid, no matter what the investment really is. And especially in something so new as BTC.

Well, then you have lost dollars at Walmart, too. It's a weird point of view, but "technically" correct.

Now this really looks like a prepared and probably paid statement... maybe the "paid shills" theory isn't completely bonkers. Maybe.
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:11:47
Well, first of all, you have left out the fact that quite some of those 21m BTC will not be usable because there is no private key. 
Then there's the fact that the last few million BTC won't be mined for decades to come. And then there is the inflation of fiat currencies year by year. How much USD would you need in 20 years to have the same buying value as 1 USD today? 
But another point is that you compare BTC to the amount of fiat currency in circulation. I'd say that's wrong. BTC isn't just a currency, but a tool for financial transactions.
"On a typical day, more than $14 trillion of dollar-denominated payments is routed through the banking system. " (and that was 2012, should be more now)
That's USD only, one day only. If BTC can play gobal role and even if there would be all 21m BTC in circulation, even with 0.0053% share it needs to be worth a lot more than 186 USD.
But that's all just looking in a crystal ball, blindfolded, in a dark room facing the wrong direction.

Being afraid of losing 40% of your life savings and then putting them all into Bitcoin is only a good choice if otherwise there is no way to avoid the 40% loss. BTC can go down just as much or more. On the other hand, it might even go up....

My version (basically the same): 
The only investment that has proven to keep its value over a longer period of time is gold and in the future maybe Bitcoins will, too. Gold and Bitcoin production is limited. Not so with money. Central banks can print unlimited money and today they talk about that very openly. Therefore it has no intrinsic value.

If it only were so easy. 
I sold all my BTC more than a week ago to buy a car (urgently needed) and now I already have more than a third back - cheaper. Back to HODL for me.

Because the $387 million are totally and utterly wrong. This sum is what they promised, not what they run away with. If I promise to give you one  million $ if you give me $100 now and you'll never hear from me again, did I disappear with $100 or one million $?
