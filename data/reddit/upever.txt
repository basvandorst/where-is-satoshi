It's not your money. The bank is using that fund to gamble in stocks and derivatives.

China always try to internalize a new tech and then make an exact copy of it but run by the state in combination with local start ups. Win-win for them really, boosting local economy while keeping all the new tech within the gov.
China is the new centralized bohemoth. Stop giving them new tech for them to copy.

China's MO: let foreign innovations in the country: Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, Uber, Twitter, Apple, Bitcoin.
Ursurp the knowledge.
Ban those companies, set up and fund locals to copy and have state monopoly of such tech.
Instant boost to local economy and made tons of local chinese rich. Baidu, Weibo, Wechat, DidiTaxi, Alibaba, TaoBao, Huawei, ALL are carbon copies of their western counterpart.
Get it?

China should just walled itself off and give us back the tech that they so lovingly copied and renamed.
Also, stop Chinese immigration to the west.

Stay in China if all you do is taking our tech and renaming it. Google: Baidu, Amazon: Alibaba, Uber: Didi, Apple: Huawei. 
What industry you created? Nothing. You take, rename and kick US out to have state monopoly on critical technologies.
Jig is up, no one is buying your schemes. All eyes on chinese and their thievery and usury.

So I just set up Mycelium and does it have private key? Because I only have seed words for it as back up. Does it mean I don't have private key with Mycelium? Also if I want to get BCC, is Mycelium the wallet to use?
