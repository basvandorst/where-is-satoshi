Ok, computer science is exact and Economics is not... couldn't agree more.
Still.. not sure wether money is a program executing in a controlled environment or a social phenomena arising from complex relations among people.
Some economists point out that given the cost of reproduction of the whole bitcoin network tends to zero (open-source, other cryptocurrencies will show up..etc) the expected value of 1BTC should too. Or that its volatility (vulnerability to financial speculation) calls for a more stable alternative. Or that existing in a fixed ammount bitcoin is deflationary, with all what this implies. 
Anyways, I honestly wonder if Systems Engeneers are aware of all this issues or just discard them as dead wrong because of who they come from (economists).

Agree to some extent but.. you expect start-ups to make profits along the road. The present value of those expected flows make your fundamentals analysis today. Same with bonds and most assets, they are expected to produce new earnings that are ultimately related to economic activity growth.
What would be the btc equivalent to expected profits/earnings ..?

What metrics you mean can be considered fundamentals to its value..?

“btc fundamentals are getting better...”
 what does that even mean 
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:07:38
it can be used, but is usually not

I didnt mean illegal, just not legal tender ie a medium of payment allowed by law which you cant refuse to extinguish a debt

so you buy me an ipod, send me the 0.000x btc OK, but I dont send you the product.. where will you complain? to whom?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:03:42
you are right, but when gold ceased to be legal tender it also ceased to be used as currency

plus in most legal comercial transaction there are taxes involved..? irs wont take anything but legal tender money 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:46:01
but I guess you cant make an invoice expressed in bitcoins.. how will you take the case to a court, just by saying that you allegedly made some sort of digital transaction from some allegedly "wallet" to some other in exchange for a good/service that was not provided (let alone the anonimity of the wallets). if it's no recongnized by the legal system as legal tender, what elements will the judge have to determine if a payment was done or not

i dont have a clue what does that tells me about bitcoin not being legal tender
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:37:14
i guess they were prosecuted for the crime itself.. not for faling to fullfill a bitcoin contract
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:45:21
where's the vat ? how much will "blue tree it inc" acknowledge as income to the irs for those 2.74 btc ?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:50:21
yes I mean taxable transactions, sorry for not being clear about that in the first post. i'd like to understand how can bitcoin become mainstream and a major way of conducting payments worldwide
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:17:55
today you totally can NOT make an invoice expressed in BTC, you can not pay the invoice taxes using BTC nor express them in BTC, blockchain record transaction cannot be linked to a person (wihtout plausible deniability), any good/service transaction implies a debt between the moment you supply/provide and the moment you settle the payment.. come on

I see.. so for example I would be bartering some gardening service in exchange of some BTCs and then I would pay the IRS according to some USD valuation of that service.. is that right
