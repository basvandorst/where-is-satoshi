Why? 
What makes you think that if the price goes outside of that range, the price doesn't continue its pattern of converging on the S/F model? 
Can you address my questions in the comment above please?
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:28:22
Thanks for the response!
I get what you're saying, but the S/F implied price lies inside the NHW, correct? 
If so, why do you claim that the price converges towards the NHW? In what way is that different from saying that the price converges towards the S/F implied price immediately after halving? 
What am I missing here?

It's just a Bitcoin ATM.

There's several bars in Singapore with Bitcoin ATMs, but I don't get the point.

Thanks, 
The "O" in the top picture are not the same as in the bottom picture, correct? In the top picture, the "O" is the lower bound, while in the bottom picture, the "O" is the actual price at time of halving. 
I have a Master's in finance and deeply understand Bitcoin, and I still don't get what you're trying to say with the whole NHW thing. 
Why is the NHW defined as T-1 and T+1? Why not both T or T+1? What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:01:11
Mate, I give up. 
No wonder this got no traction at all.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:35:31
Ok thanks, but why is the upper bound defined by S/F price at T-1? 
In other words, why wouldn't the upper bound immediately jump up, together with S/F price?
Sorry for all the questions, just trying to understand the model :)
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:48:09
I get now that the "O" in both pictures refer to the multiple at the time of the halvings. 
I've re-read the entire section 4.


Looking at figure 4 in your paper, the NHW windows don't begin below a 1.0 multiple, correct? 


Why is that so? Why do you expect the price the jump *above* the old upper bound immediately on the day of the halving? 
Can the crux of this argument be summarized as follows: "*Immediately after the halving, the S/F model price increases dramatically. The actual market price will not immediately match the model price. Before the actual price matches the model price, the actual price passes through the NHW."*
Is that correct? Am I missing something? 
Really trying to understand the significance of this but grasping at straws.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:54:16
Ok, why is the NHW defined like that? What is the significance of the NHW? 
I feel like I'm missing something here because I don't get why it's important that the S/F price falls outside some arbitrarily defined window for 3 days every 4 years.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:06:37
Excellent work! 
Question: 


I'm not sure I'm completely grasping this. Wouldn't the S/F predicted price always fall in between the upper and lower bounds of your model, which define the NHW? Why is it required that the market value diverges from the S/F model?
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:17:06
Not sure what this picture is supposed to say. I see the upper and lower bounds of the model; the actual price and the S/F model price. 
What are the thick blue lines? What are you trying to say with this picture?
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:15:41
I understand the stepwise nature of the S/F implied price. 
Can you elaborate on this please: 


@_date: 2019-08-04 06:52:55
Welcome. 
Please do more research about XRP, that's all I'm going to say about that.

Nice work.

Go to Twitter, a much better signal / noise ratio. 
You gotta carefully curate the list of people you follow, though.

Yes Singapore is one of the densest areas on the world. No that doesn't mean it's "crowded" everywhere. 
Yes Germany is much bigger than Singapore. 
Violent crime, rape, sexual assault, pickpocketing, theft are all much, much more common in Europe. 
Did I mention Singapore is a tropical island with summer all year long?
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:12:25
Singapore baby

I feel sad for you that you really think this is what a relationship is.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:03:10
She goes out with her friends, then walks home alone - what's the big deal?
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:50:49
That's cool, but Singapore has zero cap gains tax on *any* investment.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:55:39
Have you ever been here? 
It certainly is expensive. But crowded is relative: there's plenty of ancient rainforest with hiking and biking trails where you won't see anyone. 
The 'police state' means crime is virtually non-existent. My girlfriend can walk anywhere in Singapore, drunk, at 3am in the morning without fear of anything happening to her.
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:15:12
No. 
You need to be highly skilled, extremely rich (or both).
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:04:49
Thanks for your advice.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:01:00
Lol, insecure cucks. I've gone and still do go sometimes with her. She also allows me to hang with the boys. 
That is what a mature relationship entails.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:07:56
Ah sorry, I missed that. 
I somehow doubt that guy has a lambo..

Coindesk mate. Don't take anything they write seriously. 
There's only a handful of good news sources in crypto. 
- Bitcoin Magazine
- The Block
- .. probably one or 2 more
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:16:27
Come on man.

You had Bitcoin several years ago. 
Which means you can afford a hardware wallet. 
Get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:02:26
Shit, sorry I just read your top-level comment. 
That's a shitty situation mate. Props to you for being a great parent. 
Apologies for the shitty comment above.

$140K after 8 years of hodling? 
That's pathetic, sorry.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:50:15
Of course I do, multiple. 
I suggest reading up on the benefits of using these vs. paper wallets or steel backups.
