truth is, it went up 100% in two weeks
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:36:52
Some drunk dude posted about a bitcoin crash years ago.. and he's like "I'm just going to buy and HODL"... dude was unable to type "HOLD"...
Millenials thought it was cute , so that is now their term for someone who is cultishly devoted to Bitcoin and will never sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:51:15
and a year from today.. it may be again
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:49:42
i'm reminding you.. we're almost there
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:49:18
well it all depends on your purchase price
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:58:11
it'll go up for here.. at least for a while
the 7 was based on the idea that 15500 was the top
20k was actually the top...so the 50% pullback was 10k..where we are right now
I think it goes up from here.. at least for a few weeks... might never come back to 50%.. hard to say

You are comparing an index of 1000s of companies with what?? 
BTC? 
While the entire Nasdaq did recover, many individual companies from the dot.com era did not recover.  Pretty sure Marthstewart Online (MSO) and Mothernature.com (MTHR) never recovered.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:27:15
with BTC, you can check out any time you want, but you can never leave :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:50:16
i screenshot'd it too
almost there
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:29:50
well the price is going straight up right now, having doubled in three weeks
so... should I be fearful or greedy?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:27:26
When is "the end"?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:24
Bitcoin will lose at least half of its value, which is currently $15,500.
You can buy it in less than a year for half of that, or $7750
I'll be back to remind you all.. in this thread
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:50:54
here's the danger.. "the internet of money"... let's say that blockchain is the "internet of money"
The Internet has transformed the world... companies that built the internet and profited from the internet created the biggest financial bubble of all time in 1999 and 2000... many of those companies crashed and burned and no longer exist.. people lost their fortune... not because the internet wasn't a thing but because of the bubble.
How do we know that Bitcoin isn't the AOL of the internet era? or what Commodore Computer was to home computers?
Sure its the first... sure blockchain money will probably be a big thing some day..... Does that mean BTC is going to be the currency of choice? Very unlikely.. first is rarely the best or most successful
anyway.. I think you're going to see a crash and burn that eliminates 90% of these garbage "ICO's" before the next constructive leg up.. thats exactly what had to happen in the internet bubble where garbage IPOs were appearing every day and being bid to the moon
i see the same thing happening right now in garbage ICOs that have no real value.
sorry to rain on the parade... save this post and in a year you can come back and laugh at me....
or, you can say.. "damn.. this guy nailed it"

Bitcoin will have been replaced and cease to exist long before 2140..
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:01
depends on what the peak is
If Bitcoin hit its speculative peak yesterday, it'll likely correct to under $5000
we don't know it it peaked yesterday or not, however
my personal buys are set at $12,000 for a good bounce
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:50
dude... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:02
it took 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:24:18
Good luck...but you know, something is wrong that most of us live in a society where two full time incomes are necessary to survive.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:38:52
there is some danger in Bitcoin right now, in my opinion.
this thing went from like zero to $1000 before the first major "crash", correction in Dec of 2013..... 
it lost like 80% of its value in that correct to below $200 at one point..
since then, its been climbing and we had a pullback in late november to below $5500.... in just a few weeks it then DOUBLED to well over $11,000 (and now almost $13,000)..
that is about 13x the first peak back in 2013....
in my experience, these are the signs of a mania top and honestly it would not surprise me to see bitcoin lose over 50% of its value from where it is now in the next correction..
when you see anything double in a few weeks time, it is a sign of danger.. I saw it in internet stocks in late 1999 and in to March of 2000
i saw stocks like AOL double in a week.. that was near the top....  what Bitcoin is doing right now with $1000 daily moves is very scary and very unhealthy
that is my opinion.. take it for what its worth
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:18
I agree. In fact, vendors are dropping it a form of payment. It takes too long for the transactions to clear.. the price changes too much each hour... the fees are high... it takes an enormous amount of energy per transaction... 
yet its up like $10,000 in five weeks...
and there's like literally 100s of competitors.. many that are faster and far less expensive to process.
biggest bubble I have ever seen.. and I lived through the dot com mania.. this is bigger
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:07:18
ok.. maybe I don't understand..
Lets say I buy Monero
how does that help Bitcoin be more valuable?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:50:00
I believe in the honesty and goodness of rich people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:46:05
LOL.. you could buy bitcoin for $12,000 on Wednesday, Dec 6.
it is currently Friday, Dec 8th.. and you are here to tell me that Bitcoin will NEVER AGAIN trade where it traded two days ago
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:36
Well.. here we are.. two weeks later
BTC trading under $12,000
may go to $10k now
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:23:58
you have to buy Bitcoin with money. The money comes from you.
When you sell it, the money comes from the buyer.
Same as if you bought and sold a rocking chair.
That's the way you get bitcoin, unless you are mining bitcoin, at which point you are paid in "bitcoin".... which you can then sell to a person for money
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:31:09
if you live in NY I believe Coinbase is the only way to legally buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:01:09
it might go to 32k next year.. but it'll be at 7700 before that
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:46:56
Sure .it's only up 300% in one month..what could go wrong?

you make it sound like Bitcoin has a monopoly on the technology.
They don't...(or maybe they do???)
 they will be replaced by something that does it much better..that's my point..

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:01:02
yeah, the blockchain will stick around.. once they make it more efficient.
Let's put it this way.. the day my wife uses digital currency to buy something from Amazon.. i seriously doubt it will be Bitcoin that is used.
anyway, bubbles are a lot of fun on the way up and on the way down too (shorting).. ... but really really tricky. I thought that the "top" was in last week with the $2000 intraday swing... but apparently it wasn't
some are saying $20k by end of the year...  could happen... i don't know
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:09:46
i think overnight is hard to imagine
but yeah.. 77% is the rule of thumb I use on a speculative bubble pop
but that can take a long time to play out
of course in the case of stocks, they often go to zero, because the drop in stock price causes them to be unable to raise investment cash necessary to survive.
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:27:23
not a bad idea. 
AOC proposes something similar in the New Green Deal.. print the money, use it to purchase green infrastructure, pay people liveable wages, etc... 
I totally agree that this is how we should be funding the gov't.

he's right. He is absolutely 100% right
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:50:45
This is a corrupt system.
The government forces you to pay taxes (under threat of imprisonment or loss of property) using money that you can only get from them.... they create it out of nothing.
The only way you can get it, is to pay the government.. either in labor, or in interest.
Its slavery.  Its also brilliant.. I wish I had thought it up

and you know what?
had they won World War I, they could have paid off their debt by printing more money
Had the Southern States won the Civil War, they could have done the same thing
Fiat money is basically backed by war. 
That's why the US can print money right now with no negative side effects.   Its because militarily, we are the only super power, currently. Until someone beats us on the battle field, we can print money to pay  our debts

I'm a fairly smart guy (chemical engineer) and I have followed bitcoin for at least a year or more.. I read stuff like this thread and I have NO CLUE WHATSOEVER you all are talking about.. but it sounds pretty bad.
This is why I haven't bought any Bitcoin and probably never will.. i'm guessing this is why bitcoin will always be kind of fringe. Just thought I'd weigh in.

Bitcoin is good as long as there is electricity and the internet.
I'm not sure how valuable bitcoin would be in a true crisis, however.
all the bitcoin in the world wouldn't help you much in Houston right now, if you have no power and no internet... but then again, what good would gold be, as well?

still waiting though
Don't you think the gov't will want MORE control of the money, not less?  Don't you think they will want to track everything you purchase, just like they monitor your phones and texts?
I think this is the biggest threat to BTC and digital currency. Gov't wants more control.. not less.

@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:43
sounds like you have no real use for BTC, but rather you are simply trying to trade it to increase your supply of true money, US dollars.
good luck. Trading anything is hard.
People try to do this with houses, for example. Its hard because you never know if the market is going to go up, or down.
Better to buy a house because you want something you can live in.  That way, it doesn't matter to you if the price goes up or down
Almost no one is buying BTC for use as money. .No one... And for good reason. its expensive and awkward to use it as money
for this reason, BTC is now in a long, drawn out bear market that will see a return to probably $4000-$5000 this year.
EDIT: anyone that tells you to "HODL" is a fool and takes delight in the fact that they can't spell.
Edit 2: I was warning people a month ago about this.. .its gotten worse since then

@_date: 2018-02-02 19:22:29
BTC is dead for the next few years
Dead meaning it won't hit its high again.. It won't likely even get back to $15000 again for many years.  Sure you can still make money buying and selling.. my God the thing moves like 10% every day.. .so, its a daytraders dream.. But the bull market is over.. we're now in a bear.

None..I couldn't find a broker that would let me short it without insane interest rates...plus, if you use too much margin those wild $1000 point swings will take you out
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:11:33
well, that wasn't my experience at the time.
Maybe the brokers that I was using were screwing me, but I was paying $20 to move less than $500 around. and it took a few hours to do it
after I sold all my BTC about a year ago.. i haven't tried since.
EDIT: My heavens.. I almost forgot about Coinbase as well.. that company was so poorly run, I was convinced it was a scam.. I see its still going however
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:51:38

Very interesting article... serious issue discussed there.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:55:34
yeah, I will be a buyer of BTC under $2000 if I get that chance.. 
The problem is, living in NY, its hard to put money in to a brokerage. There are all these state rules and prohibitions and I really don't want to use Coinbase again.
I used to trade at Hitbtc.com and a few other places but its become a real headache to get the money in

hmmm.. could be about right at some point
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:08:28
I think its still on its way down.. should bottom out just under $2000 sometimes this year.. in my humble opinion.. by next Christmas it'll be back around $3500..
that's my prediction... I'll be back next year to see how we do
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:01:11
well, I only knew it would lose half its value.
i wasn't saying that was going to be the bottom. It was obvious that it needed to correct 50%.. I thought it might stabilize and go back up. I'm not an analyst .. i'm more of a short term prediction guy
but I think the product hasn't delivered on its potential. I tried using it to move money around and I found it to be expensive and relatively slow.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:03:11
thanks.. that's because i'm 49.. and most of these bitcoin bandits are in their 20s and 30s
I was their age from 1998 to 2001, during the internet bubble
i've seen and heard it all before and I know how the story ends
EDIT: i made a ton of money from 1998 to 2000.. investing in "can't miss" internet companies like CYBR and CSCO and DELL and AOl and.. (on and on it goes).. I made 10x my orginal investment.
I'm here to tell you that I lost it ALL over the next few years.. as I kept trying to "buy the bounce",convinced that all of these companies that lost 80% or more of their value were going to "go back up"
almost NONE of them did.. a few did.. EBAY.. AMZN.. but others like AOL, CYBR, (and a ton more that I can't even remember the stock symbols) never went back.. they got bought out at a fraction of their internet bubble peak value.. or they went under.
