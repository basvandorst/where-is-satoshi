Well, buying something with crypto only to have it immediately converted to fiat isn't really great for the currency. The only difference between selling your bitcoins and buying something with the fiat from that, and buying something in bitcoin directly which is immediately converted is the message that "Hey, I'd like to be able to use bitcoin."
The endgame needs to be people using crypto and keeping crypto to use again later. Imagine you want to give about $300 USD to your friend in kenya. You buy $300 BTC on localbitcoins then send that to your friend who sells it on an exchange and gets cash deposited to their bank account. Does that offer any practical benefits over something like western union? Not much really. The "fees" paid may be a bit better but when you weigh them against convenience, western union or paypal is a better value overall. 
Although its a long ways off, its important to start moving towards a society where crypto transactions are received and kept until they need to be spent, rather than a temporary store of value for moving fiat around semi secretly.

I agree. Am I just dense? I cannot even conceive how the success or failure of BTC could potentially effect apple and would be interested for someone to explain it. Apple has always been a control freak of a company and their favorite place to exercise that tendency is the app store. I remember them banning an app that tracked drone strikes. Perhaps people being aware of drone strikes is also a threat to apple?

I think you're on the right track. I'd guess it's more of them hedging against the possibility. If crypto currency starts moving to a place where it could start eating their business, its great for them if they're in a place where they can survive and potentially thrive among a new paradigm of payments. 
It's a great move for both paypal and bitcoin, even though I really don't like paypal. Maybe they'll start doing things better and can even regain my favor at some point.

I think there's also the option to not provide your name.

I completely agree. A statement as sweeping as "O'Reilly is known to be against free software," were it true, could be backed up by something other than a rambling 20K word ad hominem treatise. 
This post is nuts, it's criticizing O'reilly for logical views such as 


O'Reilly provides high quality, DRM free ebooks for a reasonable price along with great customer service. I have yet to read any convincing argument they don't deserve my business.

Since you were born in Australia, I'll consider you an unbiased third party.

Yea that's the thing about markets, they very quickly become a self fulfilling prophecy. Even if people don't believe the news or think it intrinsically affects value, they may still believe that enough people will sell based on the news that they're smart to sell early and buy back when the selling is done. Once selling starts more people jump on.

Well with banks and the financial institutions, it is conceivable that a decentralized peer to peer system could be threatening. Not likely in the near future by any means, but its conceivable. But for someone like apple, if the whole world switched to crypto, they could also start accepting crypto and carry on their merry way. I just don't understand how it could possibly be a threat to someone who sells things.

I don't think coinbase is taking this seriously enough. There will continue to be email leaks on other sites. Given enough time, people can keep testing testing emails they come across against coinbase's user enumeration feature until a substantial database of coinbase customer emails are obtained. We already have evidence of a small database of coinbase emails just days after the disclosure of this bug/feature. 
Even if it's true that user enumeration happens on many other sites, bitcoin users are high value targets because the money is more difficult to trace back to a real person once its stolen. 
Sure, users can avoid this by using a unique email address or being careful to avoid phishing links, and we should definitely do that. Still, I find this to be a bit irresponsible. They should at least offer an opt-out.

I thought your disclosure was great. It isn't a huge security issue but its definitely substantial enough it needs to be fixed. Its a shame that this had to happen for it to be fixed, as I'm sure many users will take the bait. Indeed, it seems some already have.

I have been confident from the beginning that there was no leak on coinbase's behalf, and that hasn't been the issue that most well informed people have. It is almost certain that this is what happened:
Someone had a list of emails. They were probably from a bitcoin related site, but could have been from a number of different services. They used coinbase's payment feature to determine which emails in their list have coinbase accounts, as well as people's names. 
It's been clear that coinbase wasn't actually "hacked" from the beginning, and that all the FBI/IRS stuff from the pastebin is FUD. 
The issue people have is that this service, which allows anyone to check whether a given email has a coinbase, is insecure as it allows for phishing on a large scale. The pastebin leak is just proof that many email addresses can be confirmed this way. 
What coinbase ought to do, as has been mentioned, is allow us to opt out of the service which lets people check our email address. In addition, they should rate limit requests to that API more stringently.

If dogecoin reaches hundreds of dollars each, lets say $200, that would be a market cap of USD 20,000,000,000,000. I don't think we need to worry about that any time soon.

Wow, you actually answered. Awesome, you made my day! Unfortunately I don't keep any bitcoin around (sorry) but if you're interested in some Reddcoin let me know.

How short could they possibly be? If they had even 1/4 of the required funds they could buy up BTC at 1/5 of their market value knowing that their exchange will function again multiply their capital 5 times and come out with a profit and at least moderately happy customers.

Interesting. Is there any link expanding on the differences? Not that I don't believe you, I am just interested and couldn't find anything.

Well remember that no one knows where Bitcoin even came from. It was mysteriously created anonymously so for all we know the NSA made it haha.
But on a more serious note the [NSA is responsible for developing many of the hashing algorithms and cryptography]( used by bitcoin and lots of other secure software.

I don't think people are selling because this makes it a bad investment. They're selling because the recent increases are a bubble, most of the market are relatively short term day traders, and everyone's sitting there nervously with their fingers on the trigger waiting to sell at the beginning of the correction that is undoubtedly coming (I'm guessing it will correct further in the next month or so). 
It's not that people are losing faith in it's long term value, they're either happy with their profits and exiting or waiting to rebuy at the bottom and double up.
