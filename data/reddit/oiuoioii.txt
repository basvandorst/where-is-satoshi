sorry, edited. also you posted from your real account.

holy shit don't you know anything about bitcoin?
inform yourself. spend some time on the wiki and in before you post here again please.
@_date: 2014-04-25 03:45:34
fuck off, seriously.
are you 12 or just very late to the troll party?
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:17:09
well anyway.
android and blockchain.info were vulnerable for a while because of RNG flaws in java and javascript.
but there should be no RNG bug in current software which means additional signatures don't increase the risk of revealing your private keys.
don't reuse addresses ffs.
it seems like your coins were immediately sent to a tumbler and 150 is a nice round number so i suspect a hacker might have done this by hand.
check your system for malware, move the rest of your coins to secure addresses, install linux.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:38:26
why didn't you store such an amount in secure cold storage?
if you're too lazy you could just ask your next best nerd friend or pay someone to do it for you...
oh and please sign another message with 16mLN1bvHArZGUxT5TgHjixR43sLJ6hUMR or I call bullshit.
i can't believe you used a mobile phone to generate a key holding 150 bitcoins.
sign my post or parts of your post.
nevermind doesn't actually matter... whatever this is, it is malware or a hacker, not an RNG bug or your coins would have been stolen right away.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:27:39
bullshit. all you have to do is not reuse addresses and use proper RNGs.
only 158 addresses were affected which is just a drop in the water.
