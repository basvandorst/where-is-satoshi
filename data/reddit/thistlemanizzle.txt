I think Coinbase's approach is to make them the easiest way to get Bitcoins. None of this risky exchange business.
@_date: 2014-01-25 06:58:37
I think that's more because Mt. Gox is always the highest value making it the first to breach 1,000 and so on.
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:39:45
YES! Thank you!

I'm organizing UCSC's 1st ever Hackathon, would you be interested in having a small bitcoin sideprize at the event? Something on the order of $250-$500?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:21:49
I think it's because all their ads have a british voice in them.
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:19:28
So this is good news? :P
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:07:58
Does that work with purchases as well? Because that's partly what we're trying to do.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:53:28


Man, come on. Let's not remind people about all the money they could have had by now if they had bought into bitcoin. I'm still trying to forget.
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:40:58
No one downvoted your post? Bitcoin community must be optimistic. Time to buy bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-08-10 03:48:54
Why would it be XBT? I've only ever known BTC (but I'm only a few months into bitcoin).
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:45:21
What's the matter, you don't like the early 2000s?
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:07:47
Doesn't everyone pronounce it mount. gox? All this time I've been saying mount gox instead of empty gox....
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:35:19
Oh Ok, that makes sense. I haven't paid someone in person with Bitcoin before, so I didn't know that's how the system works.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:23:16
What was the logic being offering these for sale in the first place? Too risky to just develop them for internal use? Because it really sounds like they created a money press and decided to sell it instead of just printing currency.
@_date: 2013-07-10 23:53:13
Or maybe the bubble ended because they were selling flowers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:17:20
Then you can never use your degree!

Time said the FBI seized about 3.6 million in bitcoin.

Lol, thought this was Bill O'reilly for a second. Fiat currency is for pinheads!
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:29:44
Thanks for the answer that settles it for me.

Isn't the prospect of no chargebacks a disadvantage for the consumer? When I use my credit card, I am somewhat comforted by the notion that If I am scammed out of my money, I can always turn to my credit card company to cancel the transaction and refund my money.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:08:47
How is it easier to pay your gardener with bitcoins than cash? Isn't it more of a hassle since the volatility means that you have to convert up to the minute you pay the guy? I'm assuming you're using USD or whatever your countries currency is as the basis for the transaction and not saying he gets 0.5btc every time he does it regardless of bitcoin value.
I hadn't thought of the tipping aspect, that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:15:01
What? The Bitcoin crash means that BTC is being used more and more as a currency and more businesses are taking it? I need to get in now before Bitcoin rises in value again!
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:43:34
Now that's very interesting. I hadn't thought of that.

Why not use Coinbase?

If I don't have the tower, how can I figure out the rate?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:49:32
Discrepancy in exchange rates between Mt. Gox and  the other Bitcoin exchange platforms. Basically, Bitcoins on Mt. Gox are going to lose a lot of value when they reopen. This is not an indictment of the currency or in praise of it. That's just what is going to happen, otherwise it will be an extraordinary opportunity for arbitrage.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:00:48
That point still makes me lol. It was a great pivot, but still..."before we became the de facto standard for trading crypto-currency we provided a platform for people to swap playing cards."
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:20:14




That is not what I want to see, ever...
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:56:49
It could do anything in the next few hours. But, I do expect it to at least initially crash whether or not you'll see it go back up because the prices drop to below a certain threshold is another thing.

I would be supremely disappointed if Bitcoin only ever makes it as far as Esperanto, that being said, you can use French in a lot of places (cause of all the colonies). Maybe Portuguese?

Not only that, certain lawyers will do high profile cases pro bono, since it raises their profile or they see a great injustice.

It happens pretty regularly though, maybe something happened in China?
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:37:10
And now it's mysteriously went to $180. I really hate the volatility. I prefer stability over rapid growth any day.
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:08:15
I see conflicting information on chargebacks. Some say they're just applied willy nilly without any sort of investigative process-making it very easy for a customer to engage in fraud and others say that there is a process and showing evidence allows you to dispute the chargebacks.

Quick question, aren't binary options just gambling?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:36:41
But the conversion fees are still less than the costs of accepting credit cards right?
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:58:50
They're backed by Y combinator, they're legit just oddly incompetent.

I wonder what the intersection between bitcoin users and Windows Phone is, I would imagine we're disproportionately android users. 
Good work though, this is pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:47:27
its going to crash. Take a look at the prices on the other exchanges. It would be weird if they weren't similar. Like an extraordinary opportunity for arbitrage, just buy bitcoins from the other exchange and sell on mt. gox. Here: 
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:47:29
But it's also true that the number of linux users among us must be higher than the general population. When I think Windows Phone I don't really think of it as being attractive to many of the Bitcoin users who like to tinker with code and hardware.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:35:05
Wow, I never noticed this until now. That's actually really perceptive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:35:09
It's in MtGox's interest to be seen as a reputable and reliable entity. Keeping the value high doesn't matter if no one is using the service. Serving many at a low price is just as good as serving few at a high price.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:35:51
They point out in one of their answers that they don't disclose the criteria for risk determination because someone could then game the system.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:49:00
explain plz.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:34:05
You are not investing, you are speculating. There is a difference.

A website, stay with me here, that lets you use bitcoin to see pictures of naked ladies. It's foolproof!
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:38:52
Lol, I welcome your theories on what's causing this.
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:04:27
"I know that accepting a stolen credit card means you lose that money", I'm talking about outside of that. What's the deal with chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:12:24
About 2.5% cheaper right? Is this also taking into account that they have to pay conversion fees whenever they need cash to pay for their own expenses?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:26:19
What I mean is, if you have an agreement to pay someone in bitcoins and in this case, in real life, you have to go through the trouble of checking the conversion charts at the very second you make the transaction and even then you can lose a little in the process (at least in USD). In a real life scenario it seems like Cash offers the same privacy and untraceability with the added advantage that the value of those dollars is very stable. So it seems like the upward trend is more of an argument for speculation than using it for transactions.
