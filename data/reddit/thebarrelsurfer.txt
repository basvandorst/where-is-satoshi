Studying past circumstances and results is literally how you make predictions in any field lol. If you think this somehow doesn't apply to supply and demand, then every successful trader ever has proven you wrong. Your exaggeration doesn't make sense. I don't have the kind of captial to make billions of btc's price moves. A trading strategy also doesn't have to have a 100% success rate to be very profitable. Like i said risk management is essential to cutting your losses and make sure that your winners outperform your losses. Just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it doesn't work.  
Also, this is the very first time i have tried to debate someone on this sub about trading. It will probably also be the last because i see it is lost on you.

It looks cool but it lacks some info that most exchanges‘ order books show. And that’s the accumulative amount of dollars (or whatever base pair) in bids/asks up until a certain bid/ask price. Also it would be cool if you find a way to write the number of dollars at a bid/ask price on that price‘s 3D block. 
Cool project.

There are many different methods in TA to arrive at the same conclusion. Whether it's studying price action, candle stick patterns or different indicators. The whole point of ta is to study past price-movement and make predictions based on it in the future. After this particular strategy worked 4 times before in calling swing tops and bottoms, it's no surprise it has worked for the next 4 tops and bottoms. Successful traders find strategies that work through back-testing, stay disciplined while applying them in the future and manage their risk. Bitcoin fundamentals don't change much from week to week or even month to month. Supply and demand does however. The only way to make sense of the market and take advantage of it is through ta. It's not by looking for articles after the fact that you can blame the dumps on. But of course ta is hard. Most people who don't understand it and haven't familiarize themselves with it just dismiss it and say it doesn't work. Yet there are still some very basic strategies you can use that will outperform any hodler in a bear market.

Your project has really got me thinking how displaying all that info could work. :) Have a look at how the [Bitmex orderbook]( looks. They found a nice way to include a cumulative depth chart in the orderbook, while having a column of the specific order sizes for each bid/ask price. Other exchanges probably do something similar. You could maybe lay the price-specific order-sizes (that you already have) over a 3D-version of a cumulative depth chart and make them different colors. Maybe you could even have blocks on a second, higher plane that show how much is being market sold/bought.

Well, there was an attempt at an intelligent response. But you failed. No big surprise.

That was even sadder than your previous attempts at logic. Just because ta works, doesn't mean it's easy and a method for printing money. You can't spend every waking minute trading. If holding worked so well now, you wouldn't rambling on against ta. It's not my fault you love to dabble in your ignorance. I already showed one of many strategies that have called the tops and bottoms perfectly.

It's funny because ta did predict this. A simple [macd-price divergence strategy]( on the 4h time frame has been calling the medium term reversals for a while. Holding can be great. But as amazing as it is in a bull market, as stupid it is in a bear market.

They Call Me Dan is one of my favorite motivational, crypto youtubers. Props to Marco Lehmann for creating this song and to Tobias Scholze for creating the video.

Truly wonderful, the mind of a HODLer is

Because this is unlikely to be the bottom. I'm saying if the bottom isn't found in the first green rectangle. It will at least touch the top of the previous bullrun's high.
