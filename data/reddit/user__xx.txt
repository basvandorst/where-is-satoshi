All of these investors so willing to disclose their strategies. Sets it up for the banks/governments to drop the price of bitcoin rapidly. Whenever we (collectively) pin our financial hopes to something, it f£ up like a muvva...
No coincidence. The oldest story going -- The rich get richer; the poor get forced unlawful carnal knowledge. The end.

Thank you! 
Question for you: Would it scare you if I started a second experiment from $8,500 to $3k? ;)
EDIT: would it scare you if it moved lower than $8,500 and I then started a second experiment to $3k?
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:13:51
Hold on a second. You read what you wanted to see and not what I posted. I didn't suggest that my post was the butterfly effect at any point.
All I said was that price was about to slide because market manipulation was at play. And it did. Within 2 hours. I didn't say that my post was about to cause market manipulation.
Ease up.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:38:32
Already moved stops to breakeven, and it's -$1k since entry. Nothing to lose. Risk free trade.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:44:38
Thank you. I agree at the test of 10, but not to extend much past 11.5, if at all. Just going by Nokia. Nothing to lose at this point, so why not.
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:56:43
Now, I'm not here to announce Bitcoin's impending doom, but I have shorted it via CFDs from $12k. I've done so because I believe the institutions have already signalled within the price that Bitcoin will fall significantly from $12k, despite the macroeconomic conditions.
I can't comment on the macroeconomic factors because I don't follow them (I trade technicals exclusively), but you held one assumption in there that I think could be dangerous. The one about the $500 drop. 
The markets are all about sentiment and belief, and the overwhelming fact is that we - the general public - have a terrible record of trading the profitable sentiment, and assumptions like the one you mentioned are part of the reason for it.
I put to you that small drops and periods of accumulation like we're seeing right now are commonplace. It allows time for that sentiment to manifest as more orders -- the other side of the most profitable sentiment. Many examples abound, in every sector of the market.
Crypto is no different to any other asset class, in that it's still us against the institutions. And the fact is that the institutions play - and have always played - with our fears and hopes to take our money from us. Until you understand the very specific tricks that they use to scare us into and out of positions, assumptions like this one can be hazardous to your portfolio. I do appreciate that it's not your sole rationale, but it's the area I've studied and understand most so it's what I can comment on. 
Please don't take this as a criticism of your post, at all. The fact that I'm holding a short is irrelevant -- just posting advice to a fellow retail trader/investor.
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:10:38
This is fully supported by technicals, and now risk-free. Nothing to reconsider.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:09:56


It "only" shows you price in the past. That context is everything IMO, but I'll never convince you of that here, so we'll agree to disagree on its importance.   


True, and maybe I've not been here long enough but I've seen argument after argument as to why price will take off from here. Along with technical analysis, referencing historic price, it's convinced me that price will drop hard and fast, even if only to scare the recent recruits.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:36:36
Have I mined Reddit to assess the sentiment scientifically? No. But to be fair, I posted this experiment on Reddit, not a scientific journal.
Take it with a pinch of salt, guy.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:35:03
LOL. Up to you. I'm just telling you institutional manipulation is the same in all markets. 
Lloyd's Bank (ticker:LLOY) is a UK bank bailed out by its government in the last recession. Their shares were at 540+, now trading below 50. 
People have held these beliefs before. "It can't drop that far. It would take something extreme..." 
"Oh shit, x happened - it crashed."
A few years pass and a whole new wave of investors enter the game, whole new proposition - "this one can't lose!".
So much faith. So undeserved.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:37:57
I'm long from 9.5k to 11k now. Looking to take it from 11.1-11.3k down to 6k.
Took 75% of the profits from the short at 9.5k. Leaving the rest to run, but fancy the equity drawdown.
The current bullrun is to make the guys that are at a loss ATM feel hope. It won't last long, and the fall to 6 should be sharp.
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:40:03
To answer your question on why, about 3-6 hours of chart time per day for two years. I study technicals. The institutions leave clues. They took us in all the same ways. In every market/instrument. 
We may not hit 11, but I've secured profits in the same way as the short, so it's a 17% gain regardless. 
The point is to assume the worst whenever you're presented with an opportunity that the world at large believes cannot fail, or fall below a certain threshold. Then take small controlled bets against them. The world at large never wins, so you'll never make profit sharing their opinions. 
6k is bad for several reasons. You know many people are waiting for 6k to buy again. Many have confessed to as much. You included. Look back at the history around 6k, as a straight line through the chart. Now, consider this. In Nokia's day, the level people were waiting for to buy again was 13. Look back through the history of that level. You see what I'm getting at?
Look for tricks to be played where tricks have been played in the past.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:40:04
I appreciate where you're coming from, but that kinda wasn't the point.
Without dismissing your point, Bitcoin is an investment vehicle, and a lot of people trade based on what they read here. 
I'm highlighting a counter argument, that suggests we're being manipulated into HODL, based on what I perceive in the charts. Never going to be popular it seems, but if I'm right, the second experiment becomes a thought piece. 
I'm happy to leave this here for now until the outcome, if that's cool with you?
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:59:15
Good point. 
Perhaps because the only volume in the market is retail, and the institutions know something that we don't?
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:33:22
Very much appreciate the candor, and the good will -- thanks :)
As for the amount, in percentage terms it's 2% risk, for 23% potential return -- and I've already moved to breakeven. I'm risk free and it seems to be sliding even as I type. The trade is in a good place. 
Be sure to check back in, and maybe then I'll get some upvotes for trying to warn people. A man can hope ;)
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:33:01
Nice move. I managed to short it from 12.2 to 9.5, and will be shorting again from between 11.1-11.3. The vast majority of the market don't expect it to fall below 5k again, so I'm betting on that happening.
HODL isn't for me. I don't even want to own Bitcoin. Too much risk involved with owning the asset. Just taking advantage of the volatility with CFD trades. 
Helps me sleep easier than worrying about the value of "coins" I own and can't see or touch.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:05:41
A risk I'm willing to take. My trade idea is my trade idea. If it works, I'm up 20%+. If not, I'm up a smaller %. So no loss, and no FOMO.
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:51:51
Yeah, investing is such a personal thing. Do you. However, I would caution not to have such a fixed view on any investment.
I'm not saying that it will, but it's entirely possible for Bitcoin - or any instrument - to fall to 10-30% of its current value. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:25:33
LTCUSD: down to between 30-40. Up to 200-220.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:11:57
All I'm asking that you consider is that all of these assumptions have been held before, about many a different instrument, be it stock, currency or whatever. And the extremes have happened in all. 
Please, if you have a moment, look at the Lloyd's Bank or Nokia stocks and read the statements you just made as though you were holding those stocks instead of Bitcoin. There were flashpoints for the shareholders of those times also, and the price crashed through them. 
When you understand that the purpose of the markets is not simply to create wealth for the rich but specifically to take yours, you'll exercise far less faith in it.
PS: I'm not going to hold you to the nakedness. Frankly, the loss will be enough and I don't want the visual ;)

Is it a coincidence that the price slides when we see coverage like this aired?  
It's QVC presented as news. Translates as "BUY BITCOIN!" and then the price starts to creep down...
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:49:51
No, no. I just happened to call the current slide for fun. It's the internet. Believe it, don't believe it. Changes nothing.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:30:10
And I appreciate that you're evaluating what I'm writing perhaps as a new concept, but it's something I've studied for some years. I didn't chance upon $12.2k as a target for the reversal. I broke down the components from Nokia's movement to arrive at it, and bitcoin behaved as expected. You can't tell me I'm.makinf this up if you reeeeally look at the charts in parallel.
If you follow the price, you're looking too closely. Look left, and look at what it reacts to, and how far. Look at how it moves through previous points of uncertainty, and you'll see the structure - common in all instruments and markets - rather than just the shapes and formations.

Don't get me wrong. I'm an idealist, like you -- I'd love for it to be true. Sincerely. 
The realist in me is also very acutely aware that whenever we collectively pin our financial hopes on something for long enough, the big kids come in and break up our game. 
You root for the little guy, but odds are the guy with the weight and reach advantage will win. History alone tells you that we're not allowed to win en masse, so the savvier bet - IMO - is for it to fall, despite wanting it to rise.
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:52:24
Trading Contracts For Difference. Opened a short position at $12,200. Stop loss at $12,400. Price has moved below $11k, so I've moved the stop loss to a small profit. I can no longer take a loss on the trade. Hence, risk-free.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:45:48

My idea is that Bitcoin will mirror Nokia's fate. Have a look at the history of their share price. Must've been as much hell for the shareholders of that generation as Bitcoin (has already been) and will be for this one.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:09:46
Thanks. 


I acknowledge that I'm just some guy on the internet, but I'm telling you that you we won't see 12 again any time soon. Looking at it again, let me call the must destructive moves I can see playing out next. 
10.7 down to 8.4;
8.4 up to 11.2;
11.2 down to 6.4.
All prices are estimates.
Time will tell. 


The point is to think differently to everyone else. Instead of hoping it rises, like everyone else is, speculate on its demise. When you're wrong, it's small. When the masses are wrong, it's usually big.
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:30:29
Probably the banks behind it. Gotta sell the coins, and it's nicer if you make the customer feel good when they buy. 
Best way to profit from Bitcoin this year has been to short it. But this sub is still the written equivalent of Jim Jones' KoolAid. They insist we drink up, and smile as we do. Meanwhile, Bitcoin falls further. 
The recent surge is a false flag, designed to entice the uninitiated into a final buy, believing it's off into orbit. Disappointment awaits.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:05:52
In the spirit of your comment, I'm going to suggest that we'll see a rather "convincing" bounce from $10-10.5k, back to no more than say $11-11.5k before the "bears" really gather pace.

...until you see it drop back to $2k. HODL will be tested to the extremes. Look at bubble instrumens of the past and you'll see similarities in the price movement to BTC. Very close similarities too. 
Nokia stock is a good example. Take a look at the Nokia chart and then take another look at BTC. Doesn't the move back to $12k look eerily similar to Nokia's 2007 push back to $40?
Hold onto your profit for dear life. 
For disclosure, I decided to short it at $12,200 and I'll be HODL all the way down.

People also forget that half the battle with investment is timing -- _when_ you bought strongly influences how you might feel about the OPs statement. 
My only investments in BTC have been shorts, and I've been right with them. Publicly. There are more ways to profit from Bitcoin than to simply buy and hope/HODL long-term.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:28:16
Seriously, I wish you all the best.
Personally, I see this phase as the final trap at the high price points. I think the price is likely to turn either in the region of 9,450 or to do a savage triple top at 10,930ish. 
Either way, I don't care at this point; my trade is done.
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:27:42

This isn't a Coinbase trade. I've never purchased bitcoin. I don't own it. I'm trading the contract for difference in BTCUSD's exchange rate. 
Look up CFDs.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:33:35
There's a little more to it than that. Most people are sitting out of Bitcoin at the moment, but the point is that they're waiting. They're waiting for price to return to a level that they deem good value before they get involved (possibly for a second time). And that point is roughly 6k. It drops to 30% of its highs and that represents good value for many, doesn't it? 
Banks play to win. If you knew lots of people were waiting to buy at 6k, wouldn't you sell? Lots of people to sell to at that level. The final patsies. Left holding losses and a dream.
If it happens, there'll be a push up from 6k. The convincer. Not far up, but it'll hang for a while. They'll give us a chance to buy before it "goes into orbit".  And then...

You're naïve to think that the banks weren't involved for Bitcoin's value to hit 20k. They bought early on the way up, had the media frenzy the price, and are selling on the way down. What's so hard to comprehend?
Keep thinking the impossible won't happen. It'll be more fun when it does.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:08:51

Completely agree. Would be devastating to millions.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:14:31
I understand this more than you may think. This is exactly why I'd start a second experiment from $8,500 to $3k. 
If you're interested, look at the Nokia's stock chart parallel with Bitcoin's. Eerily similar. Pump and dump. Now imagine that your Bitcoins were Nokia stock, and you were holding through the same scenario we're seeing in Bitcoin now. History is a guide, particularly in financial markets.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:11:52
I wish you the best outcome, despite mine.
EDIT: At the time of writing, BTCUSD is below to $11,200 -- $1k down from entry. Stops moved to break even. Liquidation not possible.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:40:27
And this I know. And it's what I believe will continue to drive the price further and further down. More and more people will buy during short retracements, believing they've found the bottom.  Then a new "bottom" is established. Rinse; repeat.
Nokia. Lloyd's Bank. Ford. Every FX pair on the planet etc etc. Very, very deep retracements after seeming invincible. 
I don't understand why it seems so implausible to so many, but I'm willing to bet the other way because it does.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:27:41
What's with you people? Where did I post that I caused or was going to cause the slide? 
I tell you that the market is being manipulated; that the price will slide imminently after a period of ranging; it continues to fall since, and I got lucky. Cool.
If you don't believe manipulation is a pattern that can be read, good luck to you. I do. The price is falling _despite_ my post. Nothing I say or do is going to change what it does. I'm simply betting that it will slide further.
EDIT: So we're on the same page, here's the "current slide": 
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:28:00
Thanks! And sure thing! I'm trading CFDs rather than the asset itself, so I've already got profit locked in no matter what happens. Can't take a loss on the trade at this point.
Out of interest, what's the reason for the down votes? Something included that shouldn't be, or just an unpopular view? I'm fairly new to Reddit.

We're both saying the same thing again ;) I'm short from 9.6.
That surge to just shy of 10 was the signal for the hard short to follow. We should break 7 with the next push down, but "We'll see" ;)
At the risk of coming across as a crazy conspiracy theorist, I can assure you that the current appearance of the market is coordinated. Bitcoin will fall, Ethereum and Ripple will rise and then fall. The whole system is designed to influence your fears and hopes. So, as Bitcoin falls and people lose money, the narrative will turn to ETH and XRP potentially taking Bitcoin's seat at the big boys' table -- only for them to share the same fate: rise to near all time highs and then plummet again. 
The rich simply don't want company, and this is how they stop us from joining them. Introduce inflation, so that we must invest, and then line the path with as many traps as possible to take what you invest. And it's not even to take for them to have, it's just so we don't have it. Simple as that.
If it's money you can afford to lose, it's not as bad, but surely you see the sense in betting against the general consensus now?
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:27:27
Ah, thanks for the explanation! Much appreciated. 
And if that's the only reason, it's all good -- just wanted to make sure I hadn't committed some faux pas.

You didn't see the link?
Nobody is going to publish the story of banks driving price up on an asset, only to dump it. That's the game being played. Study history; study charts; do your homework, and don't expect to be enlightened on Reddit.
And for the record, let's tell both stories and you tell me which sounds like a fairy tale:
You're saying Bitcoin will rise and rise, creating a new wave of wealthy investors, rewarded for their patient investment in a new technology. 
I'm saying, the banks are pumping and dumping the asset in order to target the wealth of a new wave of investors. 
My story does not resemble Santa Claus and fairytales. Yours however...

Absolute bottom? Says who? Can you read a chart? 
Wait til you see $2,275 again. You heard it here first folks, BTCUSD going up to $8-9.1k and then down to below $2.5k.
Going to hear HODL investors crying in chorus. 
And before you start shooting shots at me, I called the current drop from 12k some months back in a post here and took some flack for it then too. Didn't make me any less right. 
Simple fact: you don't win by running in the same direction as the herd but I thank you all for taking the other side of my trade.
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:48:54
Hey, bula bula... How's it going?
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:57:20
You're right about BTC being psychological, but it's a psychological game being played against people that don't know the rules. Or even how it works. Our wealthy elite stay that way, and keep us this way, via the markets. 
Inflation means that you can no longer keep your money under your mattress, unless you wish it to decrease in value. You have to invest to keep pace with inflation. As soon as you invest, they're waiting with well-rehearsed psychological tactics to make us close winning trades early and losing ones too late. I mean, how many people held after 20k thinking it was going to the moon? Their reward for holding? Back to 3k. And once millions of us had sold at a loss, the price rises again before falling once more. 
To be honest, I see BTC continuing to mirror Nokia's fate. It will significantly fall in value, and stop to tease at a level everyone is anticipating a push up from -- in this case around 6k. I'd wager it'll push into the 5s before floating back to 6/7kish. That little push up will act as confirmation for many, and they'll buy again - dreaming about "orbit". Then we'll see it down below 3k.
Seriously, look at the Nokia chart. It's the same game being played to a new audience. I'm betting the magic point for re-entry once Nokia fell the second time would've been at around $13-14. Look at the tricks that were played along that level. Little pushes up to convince people that it's back to "orbit", spanning a few weeks, then flatline. You'll see very similar activity for BTC when it's back to 5/6k, and then lower.
That period is designed to entice more buyers in, because sellers need buyers. And we're so pegged on the idea of making money from its rise, the pros have a captive audience to sell to. Simple supply and demand -- just not as taught. 
If it ever rises again, it'll be years after the fact -- when most have abandoned HODL and sold at a loss. Think how a Nokia HODL investor feels right now...
It's very unlikely that we'll see a push up from 9k to the "orbital" levels everyone is hoping for. Bankers are too cruel to make it so easy. They secure profits in longs and shorts, whilst the unwitting public are banking everything on a single outcome -- up. The vast majority have no form of hedging in place, meaning most Bitcoin investments are exposed, and make for easy targets. Remember, their goal is not to make money -- it is specifically to take yours, and keep you from having it.

Wouldn't recommend it but good luck

"It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so."
You're planning to buy based on it going up to some fantasy orbit level that everyone keeps referring to. It's not going up again for many, many years. IF it rises again, it will be when the media and burnt investors have long forgotten about it.

"We'll see"...

And still further to fall...

Feeling kinda smug ;) 
Thanks for asking. 
Advice for anyone else reading this, **"DO NOT BUY THE DIP"**

Sub-3k? Deal.

Still think it's hubris?

No matter how much you meme, wish, hope or pray, the price will not be passing $11,100 - $11,300 on your journey to 13k.
You, the public, are all too invested in the price "going into orbit", which is what will cause it to fail. The masses simply do not win.
Eager buyers; uninitiated investors; ruthless bankers. "They" stand to make more money if you lose, so I'm betting it happens. BTC below $6k, within months, it not sooner. 
Strong short to follow, perhaps for NFP. 
PS - Before you flame me, or bitch and moan about my views, I encourage you to adopt an open mindset toward any investment or any asset class you hold. HODL is disinformation.  
Do you think investors like Buffet think in terms of HODL? It's a retail investor mentality, and IMO unhealthy because it asks for blind faith despite the events and price action unfolding. 
BTW, do you guys downvote anything that goes against "Bitcoin to the moon!!!" on this subreddit? It's an asset, like any other, but I comment on the likelihood of this asset going down and waves of downvotes arrive. You're all in love with the idea of Bitcoin providing you with some form of wealth, and the banks will use that hope against you. Downvote away. Changes nothing.

Worked out as planned. Thanks!

How about now?
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:17:42
I'll be back when we're sub-5k so you can explain it to me.
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:27:21
Keeps you going back though...

BUYING Bitcoin; not selling.

Some of us did/do. Over and out.

Can you supply any logical reasoning as to what's illogical about that statement?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:25:59
Much appreciated.
Just keep looking at the similarities with Nokia as the price develops ;)
Oh, and whilst Bitcoin is in decline - and everyone begins to lose faith in cryptocurrencies (because they've now lost money on Bitcoin) - **Ethereum will be back to $1k+, before starting a similar decline**. Some media outlets and articles are likely to suggest that Ethereum's rise could become a solid alternative in Bitcoin's stead. Perhaps the coin to make orbit...
The banks then "pump and dump" yet another asset that the masses attach their hopes, dreams and hard-earned cash to. History repeats. The poor stay poor, because the rich take directly from them - via the markets (and taxation and other devices).
It seems the way to get rich is to bet against the general hopes and beliefs of the masses. The opinions are very often given to them by popular media and "trusted" analysts, and they regurgitate it all on social media. The worst affected refuse to consider any other POV. This sub is a prime example.

Sports betting is a mystery to me, and American sports even moreso. How'd it work out?
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:38:32
Well, you can see how MY investment played out. How's YOURS doing?
@_date: 2019-09-27 09:51:27
Two thumbs up.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:41:09
Fun for me too. I bought a few coins on the recent dive. Designed to scare, but represents a decent price for me. I'll exit at a comfortable $900 for just shy of 6x return. 
I really do love trading. Nothing quite like it. Not even September Baseball ;)

Breakeven is fine. 
Rule number 1: never lose money;
Rule number 2: don't forget rule number 1.
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:39:16
Still think it's doing great?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:31:20
Hey, no worries. You're one of the few who actually bother to take in an unpopular POV. Most in here dismiss anything said against their orbital dreams. 
We hit 8k today, so the similarities to Nokia continue. I have a short position (CFD trade) from 12k to 5k. All going to plan so far.

Seeing Bitcoin as the ultimate psychological experiment is slightly naïve, and I don't write that to insult. Every investment vehicle that has had global attention has caused masses of investors to lose significant capital when buying into "the dip", after a surge in value. Bitcoin is no different there.
I'm not a doomsdayer; I'm a researcher. I've studied countless charts for years, and seen the same thing play out repeatedly. And it's obvious to see why when you consider who's playing against who. The banks play against us, and they trade on our hopes and our fears -- We hope the price rises, and it falls; We fear the price falling and it falls further.
Whether you believe it or not, the banks collude. And they hide their signals in the price. It's quite simple to see when you understand the motive and the mechanics. 
The point is, if our hopes were attached to Bitcoin going back to zero, its value would skyrocket. As we're (collectively) hoping it will rise, and have invested in that hope, it is most likely to fall. The aim is simply for us to lose. And if it weren't the case, more of us would be making consistent returns from the markets. It's not designed to make them rich -- it's simply designed to keep US poor.
Look at Gold (XAUUSD). Similar surge, big dip, resurgence and then drifting again. Nokia. Sega. UK OIL &amp; GAS (UKOG). You may not see them as relevant, but these were all investment vehicles that had hopes attached to them rising, and they all fell mercilessly. There's precedent. 
Given the imbalance of wealth in our society, do you really believe Bitcoin will be the vehicle to swing the balance of financial power and status? We're not all becoming millionaires because we bought Bitcoin years after its first surge. Not without a significant retest of that HODL (disinformation) mentality. 
If you call that doomsday, that's up to you. I'm a realist. I'm betting on the rich guys to win. They'll sink Bitcoin just so WE (collectively) lose money. Simple as that.
If you're not hedging against people actively playing against you, you're open to significant losses... and I suspect you'll view these comments very differently in hindsight.
Let's see how your resolve holds when it blows through that magic 6k mark everyone is waiting for.

"The [market] is a device for transfering wealth from the impatient to the patient" - Buffet
The sad thing here is that HODL investors are extremely patient. Too patient. They've waited out the highest opportunity to sell thinking that we're going into orbit. 
True HODL maaay benefit, but they'll need to be prepared to hold to 3k or lower again. And it could be years before it ever rises again, if it ever rises again. 
Those us with years in the game and burnt fingers have seen this all before. With every stock that "couldn't fail". Nokia, Royal Bank of Scotland, and countless others. Look at the charts for those examples in the context of Bitcoin. Extreme highs, extreme low, recovered, dived for a long time and are yet to recover (if they ever).
You'll immediately tell me that Bitcoin is different. It's not a stock; there's no comparison. Before you do, understand that they are the same in as much as retail investors attached their hopes and dreams to them, just as is the case with Bitcoin. They had their hearts broken. It's entirely possible - and actually likely - that Bitcoin HODL investors will experience the same thing.
Why? Because we're trading against institutions that would prefer we didn't join their wealth ranks.  It's a game, and they're actively playing against us. 
Take note, or not. Up to you. Just doing my part.
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:45:07
Thought I'd wait a while to reply, but I'm still interested in your view now that we've slipped past 8k. 


It's a little premature but can I request background music?
And are now you able to see the similarities with Nokia *now*?
