Same applies to everyone saying Bitcoin won't last... Well, we're still waiting for it to die :)
@_date: 2016-04-26 09:57:48
Seems like it is not available yet in South Africa/Zimbabwe. I don't see why it shouldn't be available globally (although maybe they are just testing certain regions for now).
@_date: 2016-04-19 10:38:33
Hm, I'm not in the US. Oh well, not too urgent, thanks for the advice.

Not about invasion of privacy really, just that they are using your cpu resources for their gain. The only real downside is laggy cpu, overheating and general wear and tear
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:25:27
I'm not making an argument either way, just pointing out that your comparison of certain countries owning a lot of gold is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:18:41
Decentralization does not refer to who owns bitcoin but who owns hashing power. The mining is (or should be) decentralized, not necessarily ownership.
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:19:03
Like others have said it is not worth it. Basically the only reason it is worth it for some people is because they own sites with a very large userbase (e.g piratebay), so even though each user is only contributing a small amount of hashing power, it adds up. For mining at home your best option is a top-end GPU (1080ti, or next gen) and even then you'll be lucky to break even.

Hence why I said right now. The fact is something needs to change before BTC can scale to be a national/global payment system or currency.
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:11:48
Gonna be interesting to see how congested the network becomes. Bitcoin simply can't scale enough right now.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:57:32
All your posts saying $400 is the top, $700 is the top bla bla. You've been wrong before. What's different this time?
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:12:14
Yeah, got an email from github and a minute later it has been taken down.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:36:25
Pretty sure there are like 100 posts on this already but as far as I understand there are two main camps. Bitcoin Core (who developed segwit) and Bitcoin Unlimited (who are pushing for a much larger block size). Recently bitcoin has been hitting scaling limitations (3tx/sec is not fast enough). One way to solve this is to increase the block size and another is to scale off-chain. However no one can reach a consensus. In the event that some people run bitcoin unlimited and some run bitcoin core the chain will diverge and we will now have two versions (BTC and BTU). If you have purchased 1 BTC and you have it in a wallet (or on a compliant exchange) your bitcoin will be valid as both BTC and BTU. If you want you can look at what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Market is looking very bearish right now though, and until we reach some consensus that is unlikely to change.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:42:43
Market will always react first... But yeah, other than the sec site reddit is your best bet.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:11:48
It's so laughable that they say this is the "only" reason bitcoin has any value. Haven't managed to ready a Forbes article yet without being sickened by the sheer ignorance and blanket statements with absolutely nothing to back them up.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:26:10
Nice need a few more people to buy the dip, looks like price is heading up nicely again!
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:17:05
The odds of ETF approval were at best 30% so most people suspected it wouldn't happen and so long term it had very little effect on the market. There is no doubt a HF would move the market but who know where the dust would settle.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:09:30
Um. Pls remove this mods.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:21:39
Hoping it goes through soon, should be a decent bull run once it does. Might want to get some more before that time in that case.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:10:29
You could try buy Amazon gift cards on reddit using bitcoin. It's slow but you can sometimes get them at 80% rate. However there are a lot of scammers as well.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:05:51
Try any ad listing site like Gumtree or Craig's list. Lots of scammers on there as well.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:54:48
Can we spam the issues page or something or report it to github?
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:34:46
Are the value of shares on GBTC pegged to the price of bitcoin in a similar way to what the Winkelvii suggested for the ETF? Sorry for my ignorance, didn't realise this was a thing till now.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:52:17
Terrible article full of grammatical errors and complete misrepresentation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:45:19
Same, would be amazing to get a taste of those early days mining on CPU/GPU. However, it would be terrible for bitcoin's value, as least in the short/medium term.
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:56:50
Done. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:48:40
508 now

is saying it lost $400 I guess. is misinterpreting him to mean a price prediction and saying it will go to $800. I'm just guessing at this stage :-P
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:48:55
Say what?
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:33:55
Imo now could be a good time, or wait and see if there's a smallish dip. BTC has shown that it doesn't care about ETF's etc and in general it's trending up, has true scarcity and is anti-correlated to world markets. Some people think we could see $2000-$3000 this year. Always remember to never invest more than you can afford to lose ;)
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:25:30
It is good then that Jihan is the kind of mature person that would never stoop to petty insults and trash talk:  /s

This makes it sound like the moon is a planet...
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:14:36
You definitely shouldn't ask people on here to give you bitcoin and most faucets are probably a waste of time. If you're trying to actually learn how bitcoin works then check out Andreas Antonopoulos' Mastering Bitcoin (or read online). If you want to invest you can start by buying small amounts from an exchange, preferable one in your country. And remember not to invest more than you can afford to lose :-P Good luck.

Private blockchains are pretty pointless

I had the pleasure of attending his talk in Cape Town last week Monday and will be seeing him again on Wednesday. Such a great guy with a real passion and deep understanding for the power of this technology.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:29:21
Not dead yet...
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:38:14
Yeah lots of FUD atm... People selling BTC for ETH etc...
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:46:28
Lol how is holding a vote for BU? BU has been trying to create all the FUD and drive the price down. Another good buy opportunity imo. And yes if you have your coins in a ledger they will be valid on both chains in the event of a split. Doesn't look like there will be a split anytime soon tho.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:20:32
Both, in the event of a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:00:34
What indicators? I also thought we were going back up at $1100 yesterday and ended up making a few bad trades.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:59:13
Currently it can support around 3 tx/s which is around 259000 tx/day. If we double the blocksize the capacity would double and so on. However, it seems reasonable to assume that at some point the blocksize should be set and then transactions would need to scale offchain. Miners presumably don't like off-chain scaling as they see it as a thread to their profits.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:26:54
You would probably need to sell them on an exchange. Try find one and you will need to verify your identity most likely.
Some sites let you sell for paypal without verifying
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:36:25
I made close to as much as I could given my smallish investment. Was happy to be able to buy the dip though. Just hope we don't see anything else too crazy tonight, I'm sure a lot of people might not have heard the new yet.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:35:00
Managed to buy the dip hoping we can return to around $1200 and build some strong support at that level to reduce the FUD surrounding possibly forks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:47:40
Yeah I don't think it'll be possible for me to get all that set up from here, plus I'm sure the fees on the wire transfer would probably make it not really worth it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:00:30
Bear in mind that the hard limit of a TCP packet is 65535 bytes and the hard limit for ethernet is 1500 bytes. Having hard limits doesn't mean something can't scale and having no limits is almost certainly a terrible idea for security, among other things. Bitcoin needs to not scale gracefully (i.e. when it doesn't scale don't collapse), and then scale based on new use cases (scaling off-chain etc). Given the current situation something like segwit seems like a best first option imo.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:47:12
You mean next halving or the last one? Seems like a 2020 halving is a bit far away right now...
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:22:16
You're trying to fight the natural evolution of the technology. In the end of the day only the cheapest, most efficient and fastest method wins. You can compare it to mining of other commodities. During the gold rush normal people could find gold by panning. These days it's mainly large companies that control the mining industry.
@_date: 2016-06-04 08:50:32
What's the main problem with it? Feels like a bit of a mission to change at this stage? I would basically have to send the bitcoin to myself at my new wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:58:59
Miners don't agree because they see it hurts their profit in the short term. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:54:54
1000 bitcoins? Can I have one? Haha

The governments/banks in other words. Look at countries like Zimbabwe creating fake fiat currencies (bond notes) which the government declares are equal to the US Dollar. The only people it works for are the government and the banks.

He is most likely shorting and is now upset that the price isn't dropping and he has to rebuy at the same/higher price. He's been posting it for more that 24 hours it seems. Not to say that we might not see a drop. Or it might go up :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:13:41
Perhaps look at an e-copy of Andreas Antonopoulos' Mastering Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:01:13
Wait, why do we have to get out in time? Is bitcoin going to die tomorrow? If surviving the 100+ obituaries influential people and well know media outlets have written for it isn't a sign of life I don't know what you're looking for mate.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:46:23
Agreed and he would say the same thing.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:14:53
They more or less expect it to go up eventually, despite the reduced reward for miners.
