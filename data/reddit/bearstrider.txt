This point of view is wrong. Bitcoin is a reward for solving a block that contain bitcoin transaction. You don't create bitcoin by solving blocks but you are adding more transactions in the blockchain (network).
The bitcoin that you get after this processes are create by thin air and they decrease the value in USD of the reset of the existing bitcoins. By halving this reward over time you will get a worthless amount of reward in approximatively 7 cycles or 28 years in comparison of the early adopters. At this point we can hope that the success of the payment advantages will be huge enough that miners will be sustain the blockchain only for the mining fees.

Why do you think that you understand things that others don't ? Early adopters will not cash out because they are already cashing out all the time. You speaking like you imagine that early adopters have to hold everything since a point and after that they have to sell everything at once. It is wrong they don't do like this because they don't want to crash the price. They are cashing out a bit everyday and the market is growing even with this pressure.

What's a "concrete value" maybe food or water but currency don't have a "concrete value". If in the future everything is priced in Bitcoin people will get paid less and less of bitcoin for the same work. This is the reason why early adopter are USD millionaire and this is the reason that bitcoin will never be the main currency.

Hey I know that you are all bitcoin geeks but please teachers aren't so they don't think "only bitcoin".
So all our money are "electronic" non just bitcoin but dollars too. If there is no more electricity or internet it is not the bitcoin that will disappear but the whole financial system. You shoud speak about bank first and at the end about bitcoins.

Okay you have to write a message to this user: This is bitfinex staff and he is able to add new stuff very quickly.
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:35:06
Yeah because those banks employ irresponsible people that are playing with people homes like it was bitcoin.
Bitcoin is way to small to play a major role in the global economy at this point.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:45:34
you are moron whiche "bit corp" have more than millions ? 
@_date: 2014-08-26 05:01:45
million of people ? You are light years far from the true ! 30% of the bitcoins remain on the top 500 bitcoin addresses.
But believe me the bitcoin wealth is much better distributed than the USD wealth where 1% hold 50% of the dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:00:39
Coinbase isn't a Bitcoin exchange ! They are brokers that try to sell bitcoin at a higher price that they buy from bitstamp. So they have any advantage to give your bitcoin when the price rise $100 in a day and then they try to cancel transaction in order to win more money. Easy to understand no ? Just use a real bitcoin exchange and your problem will be solved.

If you know everything why to read this topic ? But by watching what you write you are totally ignorant about the technology you are talking about. How do you make a double spent ? Did you ever have seen a double spent ? I guest you don't. 1. because you don't have bitcoin 2. because double spent are very very rare. On my link you have the double spent flagged by blockchain.info there is 0 double spent. 
51% attack is a myth. Everybody that found a block can write whatever they want inside they don't need to have 51% of the network. But when you don't have control over the network you will not have the next block and someone will invalidate your mistake. This is how bitcoin work. And this is the reason why 1 confirmation isn't enough ! You need 6 confirmation for huge transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:07:57
Yeah never use paypal that's the bitcoin noob trap number one. Even you are finally able to cancel the transaction and you wasn't stupid enough to send your bitcoin you have to pay the 3$ to paypal. Bitcoin is paypal enemy number one don't expect something else.
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:26:56
Please the number of bitcoin users isn't' fixed to 1000 000 but increase every day espetialy when some one want to buy something from overstock... That's just hilarious. A bit of criticism damn hell.

I would like to help you but I need to know much more about your API and your bot. Which language do you use ? 
@_date: 2014-08-26 07:19:39
yeah but bullish in the past 12 months.

Just the end sound like a joke ! 
"Reduce the barriers and we will have a global market that doesn't discriminate financially.
Financial Equality."
What are you talking about ?
If you haven't money you are poor this have nothing to do with the currency. USD, Bitcoin shales or Bottle Cap if you live in a favelas you are fucked.

Could some one explain me how the other exchanges have found enough cash for follow the $1000 bull run if that was fake liquidity from Karpeles gox bot ? And event that's true how that's possible that this bot didn't make money by the final dump ? So why they don't have the coins ? Why the bot didn't buy back from $100 to $500 at once ?
The run from $200 to $1000 isn't something exceptional. That sound huge to people unfamiliar with finance because with $1000 you can buy a lot of cheap stuff but the run from $10 to $260 was way way more impressive. So if the gox bot have made the run to $1000 which bot have made the run to $260 ?

With bitcoin early adopters hold 90% of the bitcoins that they buy or mine for a average rate of $10. Bitcoin don't solve this problem because FED and banks continue to create money. Anyway bitcoin wasn't designed for fight again the FED or for help poor people.
Please during the 50's everybody was poor and Europe was destroyed by world war. So during the reconstruction everybody become more rich especial big business in the USA. Actually most of people live with less than $2 per day, don't have bank account or internet. So people in Europe and USA are lucky to live with the 10% that the banksters let to them.

Why do you think you can't use them in the global markets ? You can use USD all around the globe and I'm sure that in Zimbabwe you can buy more stuff with $1000 than in the USA. How could $1000 be worthless ? $1000 are $1000 in the USA and in the Zimbabwe.

Just how stupid you thing is the guy that sell you a mining contract ? If he can make more money by mining why hell should he take less money from you and let you mine with his hardware ?
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:00:59
Do you like catch a falling knife ? If the price go up you will win anyway and if it goes down you will loss anyway the whole thing is to have the ball to hodl. Don't average at loss that's a bad tactic sell everything at once and if you can't buy them back don't cry but buy less. Finally don't listen people on reddit but trade on luck because TA don't work in a market where you can make a crash with 500 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:41:12
You create bitcoin from thin air on every single block. Worker will be paid less over time because Bitcoin growing rate decrease. But I agree is better to get something growing with a predicted rate that something that the rules change over time.

Give him 0.2 Bitcoin free because that the margin he is attempting to win, don't touch his dirty money and don't sell more bitcoin because he will dump them stupidly like a greedy noob.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:27:30
The problem is real and exist because stupid bot buy less than $5 and make loss money their owner. The problem is people not bitstamp. The API haven't that $1 limitation you can buy as much as you want.

The new fee is 0.00001 So it is not $0.05 but $0.005... So with bitcoin 60 items is $0.3
