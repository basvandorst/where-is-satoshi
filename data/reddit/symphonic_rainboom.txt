Removing PoW is a major change, nobody is arguing with you there. But how and why Bitcoin (and blockchain technology) works is by finding a distributed consensus, and who are you to decide that PoW is the only way to do that?
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:30:41
I would agree that there are currently no production-ready alternatives to proof-of-work, but that doesn't preclude them from happening in the future.
Are you saying that if a new consensus algorithm is discovered and it is useful to secure a distributed database, then you wouldn't consider it blockchain technology?
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:13:46
I guess that's the crux of where we disagree. I think of a blockchain as a database that's secured using any sybil-proof distributed consensus algorithm, and you think of a blockchain as a database that is secured using PoW only.
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:37:11
Removing the term Bitcoin from the Blockchain entry would be like removing the settlement of America from the United States entry.
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:39:44






That argument doesn't really make sense because you can replace its conclusion with anything and it no longer makes sense. Why does a blockchain require PoW only again, and not some other kind of distributed consensus?

Like 90% of users, I don't care if my wallet is server-independent (as long as the keys can be exported), and I don't own a trezor (pretty much all wallets are HD nowadays).

What does it use Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:02:43
It looks like you haven't looked up the definition of censorship yet so here's a copy-paste from Wikipedia:


What Bitcoin.org is doing isn't censorship because they aren't suppressing any information, they are just choosing on their site to no longer give free advertising to Coinbase. If they were, for instance, coming onto the subreddit and deleting people's opinions on Bitcoin XT, then that would be censorship.
What Coinbase is doing isn't censorship, it's compliance with currency law. Now you could argue that governments are incorrectly blocking certain transactions, but none of that is on Coinbase as a company, and it isn't even blocking information, it's just disallowing certain uses of their service, so it's nowhere close to the definition of censorship.
I happen to agree that the removal of Coinbase from Bitcoin.org is unwarranted, I just think it's stupid to keep egregiously misusing the word "censorship". So can you just stop using that word for the time being?
Edit: Never mind, I guess you guys get to make up your own definition for the word censorship.

Electrum is a deterministic wallet unlike Bitcoin Core. This means that every wallet contains an equation that describes all future private keys for that wallet. Thus all wallets in effect contain all future Bitcoin addresses, so no need to back them up frequently.

That's how Reddit works. Opinions are formed democratically, not meritocratically.
1. Someone makes a good argument in favor of something (bigger blocks). The good counterarguments are yet to be made.
2. Because popularity is so transparent through the reddit voting system, people side with the most popular opinion (bigger blocks), because everyone else is doing it.
3. This creates a positive feedback loop where more Redditors side with the popular opinion because it's already more popular. Redditors like to downvote opinions that differ from their own (they see them as attacks). Therefore arguments counter to the original one, even if they are good arguments, are mass downvoted because they run contrary to popular opinion.

Realize that when people say buying in a trading context, they usually mean market buys into the order book (limit sell orders). Conversely, selling means market sells into limit buys.
So while "every buy is a sell" is true, colloquially we call a transaction a "buy" if it eats existing orders in the order book.
So it is actually meaningful to say that "China is buying like crazy" if those buys were market orders, which is what I think OP is trying to say.

Don't put a password on the paper wallet, seriously.
It's going straight into a safe deposit box so it's not like it's getting stolen, and 18 years from now you won't remember the password, or if you wrote down the password, you won't remember where you put it (or it may have been destroyed, thrown out, etc.).
Also, a password means that if something happens to you the Bitcoin is lost forever, as presumably you would be the only keeper of the password.
Just use a normal, passwordless paper wallet and keep it safe until it makes it to the safe deposit box. You/your son will thank me in 18 years.

* OP quits his job for "Bitcoin". He has no business, and no solid plans for how he's going to provide for his family.
* applauds OP for quitting his job to work on Bitcoin, leaving his family without any way to pay the bills.
I hope for OP's sake that (1) he has some money in the bank (notice I said BANK) and (2) he will be able to get a similar job back if this falls through. Otherwise his family is pretty fucked.

Those are definitely the Bitcoin files, and they may or may not contain any bitcoins. I'm going to simplify this a bit so it will hopefully be understandable to someone with no bitcoin experience.
Depending on how many bitcoins are there, that could be worth nothing, quite a lot of money, or anywhere in between. This is how you check:
1. The MOST IMPORTANT thing you need to do right now is to go up one directory (to AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin) and find the file called "wallet.dat". This is the file that 'contains' the bitcoins. Find a hard drive you have laying around, or an old flash drive, and make an extra copy of this file. If you accidentally lose or delete wallet.dat, the bitcoins will be lost permanently.
2. Go to Start Menu -&gt; All Programs. Find Bitcoin, and run it. If it's not installed, install it first from here: 
3. After it loads (takes a few minutes), you will see a screen like this: 
4. Let it run until the green progress bar at the bottom disappears (may take a long time), and then look near the upper left of the window where it says "Balance: X.XX BTC". "BTC" stands for "Bitcoins". It's very possible that this will be a small fraction, e.g. "0.0245 BTC".
5. Multiply this number by $598, the current price of each Bitcoin, to find out how much it's worth. For instance, "0.10 BTC" is worth $59.80. The price of each bitcoin changes often, and you can always get the current price by going [here]( and looking at the "Bitcoin price" in the upper left corner.
6. Try to get ahold of whose wallet it is. If it's not worth a lot, the wallet.dat file might make a nice gift to one of your tech-savvy friends. If it is worth a lot, I would find someone experienced that you trust to help you either sell the coins or safeguard them as an investment.
Good luck and let us know how it turns out, we'd be very interested to know!
Edit: Added how to check the current price of Bitcoin.

I agree. Also, AFAIK multibit has had a couple critical wallet-compromising bugs in the past, whereas electrum hasn't.
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:25:39


Bitcoin addresses always start with a 1 or a 3, and as you've probably noticed, 1 is much more common. An address starting with a 1 requires one private key to spend funds from that address, but an address starting with a 3 can do fancy things with the builtin bitcoin network script. 99% of the time, addresses starting with 3 are "multisig" addresses, which require more than one private key to spend funds from. For instance, you can create a "2 of 3" multisig address that has three private keys, and then any transactions from that address must be signed by 2 of the 3 keys to be a valid transaction. Presumably, the 3 private keys are owned by 3 different people, so for example 2 of 3 business owners could need to approve and sign a payment before it is sent from the business' address.


The simplified explanation is that the last 5 digits or so of a bitcoin address are just a sum of the rest of the digits, called a "checksum". The software will look at the first part of the address and "add it up", then see if it matches the last 5 digits. If you typoed the address, it won't add up like it should and your software will tell you the address is invalid.

For an institutional investor the etf really is way easier. It's the difference between one click in a brokerage account vs. hiring a specialist to find a decent exchange, split up your 10mil into a bunch of orders so it doesn't crash the market (and to minimize your exchange risk), store the coins safely afterwards in a multisig wallet because your company can't trust one person, pay your tax attorney extra to calculate taxes on your bitcoins etc, etc.
So yes, the winklevoss etf will be way better for certain people in certain use cases. Hell, if my hypothetical tech illiterate grandma wanted to invest in Bitcoin, I would point her to this etf.

**How to make a circlejerk sandwich, ala OP:**
**First, pop down the first slice of circlejerk:**


Acting better than the reader and suggesting that you are too important to "stoop down to their level". Very elitist. This also has the added benefit of shutting down any argument before it even begins. +10 points.
**Second, say what you wanted to in the first place (as long as its positive about Bitcoin). This is the filling.**


**Third, lay down the final slice of circlejerk:**


This last slice of circlejerk simultaneously praises Bitcoin and gives readers an "enemy" to rally against (people who think that Bitcoin is a waste of electricity), thus serving as the upvote lubricant for the post and sealing in its delicious karma fate.
Over all, this post is expertly crafted, and I have a hunch that it will make it far in this subreddit. I look forward to reading your future work, as this is certainly some of the best has to offer.

Though this comment isn't expressly wrong, it's using the term "wallet" in an unconventional way that may be very confusing to beginners. 99% of the time when you hear the term "Bitcoin Wallet" it refers to a collection of private keys owned by one user and managed by their bitcoin wallet software (e.g. Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Multibit, Blockchain.info, etc). When the user spends bitcoin, the wallet software uses these private keys to "unlock" and spend the balances in the user's addresses on the bitcoin network. The term "bitcoin wallet" almost never refers to just a single private key or address, but a collection thereof.
"Bitcoin Address" = bank account number, or email address; a place where you can receive funds. Every bitcoin address (for all practical purposes) has exactly one matching private key, which is stored in the wallet of the user who owns the address.
"Bitcoin Wallet" = collection of bitcoin private keys and corresponding bitcoin addresses. Your wallet software transparently adds up the balance of all addresses in your wallet, and displays this as your final balance.
The difference is that unlike bank accounts or email addresses, bitcoin private keys / addresses are free and effortless to create, so there's no reason not to have tens or even hundreds of private keys (with their corresponding bitcoin addresses) in one wallet.

Your analogy fits perfectly in describing not just Bitcoin, but Google as well.

Seriously, Google is an implementation of some underlying tech, Facebook is an implementation of some underlying tech, Bitcoin is an implementation of some underlying tech.


Its current user base, obviously. What do you think gives Google its stock valuation and Bitcoin its unit valuation? Users of a service make that service more valuable, period, no matter if its Gmail, Bitcoin, or your grandma's hair salon.
By arguing that Bitcoin is worthless, you are arguing that Google stock is worthless as well, unless there is some important distinction you'd like to make that I'm not getting.

What mustyoshi said, also this is how Bitcoin change works (it's an automatic part of every transaction):

If you don't know what irony is then just don't use the word, it really is that simple.
But no, let's give the word a new definition, one that's convenient for us so we can use it and then get angry when people tell us we don't know what it means.
Not that it matters in the end, because eventually if enough people start using it incorrectly, the dictionary entry will be revised to "irony, n. Something that's similar to another thing, and also makes you laugh." At that same time, the Wikipedia article for Linguistics will have a section on how the definition of words can change based on how many times they are used incorrectly in a Reddit argument.

Point taken, but it's not apparent in the app that I have to do that to see all the businesses. It would have been great to know that (or have it as a default) before I uninstalled the app.
One more thing - your splash screen should say "loading" on it or users may give up thinking it froze or is incompatible with their phone.

If the customer has been to another store within the last 10 minutes to 1 hour, some or all of their wallet will be comprised of unconfirmed change from their last purchase.

The gui code is right here! Help make Bitcoin Core skinnable instead of complaining on Reddit!

But on a practical note, if you want to make a skin but don't feel like programming, then just create a mock up! I'd love to see a new take on how the Bitcoin GUI should be organized, and if it's really great, maybe a dev on Reddit will pick it up and write it into their bitcoin branch!

To be honest I don't think they would. I see the value in Bitcoin like I see the value in gold - not something to transact in every day, but as a store of value resistant to inflation that gets more stable as more people store value in it.
That being said, I think it would really help out the unbanked - people who can't afford to, or can't legally have, a bank account. This means they can buy things online without getting raped over the counter at walmart with a $5 fee to purchase a $15 prepaid debit card. Again, the infrastructure isn't there yet, but ATMs are popping up everywhere and I think it's just a matter of time before this is a viable option.

* Vendor id is easy to obtain, so generating an address from id+passphrase is basically a glorified brainwallet (which comes with its own security concerns).
* You can't trust the app to generate a random UUID, because the app can just pick from the 1 million "random" UUIDs that you generated on your server and preloaded into the app, just like in your example with keys. This means that as the server owner, you can effectively start trying to bruteforce people's passwords using the list of UUIDs, which once again makes it a glorified brainwallet.
If all this weren't a problem, what if the app just simply sends the user's private key to your server right after it's generated? There's no way to block internet access at the app level on iOS or Android, so it could be sending private keys directly to your server all day, no matter how securely they are generated.

Surprisingly, there have actually been a small handful of days where Bitcoin price has crashed *more* than 50% in a single day.
Still, on a yearly scale it's been going up and up.
Like all investments, high risk comes with high potential reward, and Bitcoin is sitting as one of the highest risk/reward assets or there right now, to the point that some people refuse to call it an investment, and call it a gamble instead. Definitely more like a stock than a currency at this point, and definitely not for the faint of heart.
This is why we recommend new users to keep only a small amount of their net worth in Bitcoin and most of it in more stable investments. That way if Bitcoin crashes by half again, you don't get ruined.
That being said, Bitcoin is one of the most exhilarating investments I've ever made, and I would definitely encourage you to dip a toe in. You say you're not a gambler, so limit your exposure to a very small percentage of your net worth.
Edit: I'm coming from the investment angle, because that's where Bitcoin has utility for me, but realize that a great many people find Bitcoin useful to transact with on a daily basis as well. See which camp you fall under, or if you're a mix.

This is a terrible idea for so many reasons.
See Google, who baked apps into their Android firmware, causing them to be impossible to update without upgrading the entire OS. They realized it was a bad idea, so now most of their apps are in the Play Store, completely detached from the OS.
Putting a Bitcoin app into firmware would make it impractical to push bugfixes in a timely manner, and would slow down wallet innovation on the platform. Also, it would mean that if anyone wants to use an alternative Bitcoin wallet (or an altcoin wallet), they have to have **two** wallets installed on their device, because one of them is inseparable from the OS.
This also means that if Bitcoin were to fail (or if not everybody uses it), there would be tens of thousands of people with memory used up on their device that they can never get back (doubly so, because the phone carriers will likely not let them upgrade their OS past a certain point).
But no, instead of just letting wallet apps compete to be the best, let's have a native wallet app, because GUYS LET'S FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE A BITCOIN WALLET, BECAUSE THE PRICE WILL GO UP.

You know what I really want? For people to stop getting so emotional over this piece of software. I'm tired of what this subreddit has become, the circlejerk just as much as the empty criticism. I want this subreddit the way it was in 2011 and 2012, back when it used to discuss solutions to problems in a levelheaded way.
So yes, if I had it my way, 60% of the front page would be put in and this sort of no-effort copypasta criticism would be put in Yes, Bitcoin mining is fucking flawed as all shit, and there's a good chance it could cause Bitcoin to fail.

Way to hit every one of Reddit's sweet spots with that title. Your PR guy did a fantastic job with this post - consider giving him a bonus.


Short, simple introduction that gives the reader the minimum background possible, so as to not lose their attention.


Expresses interest in the most popular topics on Reddit, again in a poetically minimalistic way. This sentence primes the average redditor for empathy and prepares them for the call-to-action.


Succinct and to-the-point, this call-to-action asks politely for the reader to become involved in the poster's political efforts. After the explicit 'what' and 'why', the 'how' is left to be assumed to by the reader, presumably because "rally behind me" or "donate money to me" would come off as cold and tactless, though these are exactly the types of behavior that the post encourages implicitly.
~~Also, it was a fantastic strategic choice to leave out the facts that you "support stiff drug penalties", and are "undecided on whether gays and lesbians should be able to marry". These two sentiments would probably turn off the average redditor to your cause, but armed with the knowledge that most redditors vote based on post title and not the content of the linked site, you correctly assumed that your post would be upvoted anyway.~~
Overall A+ in writing. I predict that this post will make it far in this subreddit and that you will probably go far as a politician as well.
Edit: With regards to the stricken out section, I definitely misread his post. He's trying to *unseat* a politician who supports that stuff. I wanted to leave it for accountability though.

No qualms with your logic, but here's some food for thought:
Why even bring non-believers' opinions into the equation? We're sitting on top of a solid technology. If we're so confident Bitcoin has technical merit, why go through the motions in this subreddit to convince ourselves that non-believers' opinions are wrong?
My theory is that we're insecure about Bitcoin's future - we don't want to admit Bitcoin's shortcomings or the possibility of its failure. That would explain the constant saccharine optimism around here, and why we actively have to post things like OP to convince ourselves that we are right about Bitcoin.

Thanks for your reply. I think that in the context of other projects, the solution you posted is useful as a loose list of resources and features to think about including when building apps such as these. When I saw the title I had incorrectly assumed it was being presented as if it had some development backing it already, and not just as a tentative idea. That being said, you really don't need feedback from Reddit to start writing the core decentralized engine for the app (the most important part), and that's what will be essential for getting this project off the ground.
Unfortunately there is no incentive for anyone else besides yourself to start the code on this project. If they do decide to start a code base from scratch, they have no incentive to associate it with "Bit451", as they could just as easily make it their own project, make all the decisions, and take all the credit. Your roadmap is generic enough that there are a ton of different ways to implement it, so the only thing a developer gets by working on your project is that the fate of their code is now directed by a stranger who may or may not be able to code (I believe you, but...).
Even after you start the code base, your project's success hinges directly on the fact that you (or others) will find solutions to giant unanswered questions, which unless you prove to us otherwise, may take 10 or 20 years to find solutions to, or might be impossible to solve. I skimmed over your proposal so please forgive me if you've already addressed these questions:
* Given that most uploaders will start from ground zero and won't know or trust other users to moderate, how do you plan to prevent the comment section of their videos from being either (1) empty or (2) dominated by spam?
* For comment sections that are moderated by trusted moderators, how do you plan to rate-limit comments so that the moderators aren't wading through thousands of spam comments for each legitimate one? Maidsafe and Storj do this by requiring their users to pay fees for each action in Maidsafecoin or Storjcoin - how do you plan to solve this without a metacurrency? If there is an automated spam filter, do you plan to somehow sync comments across different servers of the same content? 
* How do you plan to make Bit451 anonymous? What sorts of obfuscation techniques do you propose to prevent adversaries from learning your IP either by hosting their own server or by looking at BitTorrent swarm data? For instance, Bitcoin achieves this by connecting to other clients more or less at random, but for Bit451 you will need a server-client architecture because not every node will be hosting all of the data. An adversary then just needs to host popular content and watch the IP addresses roll in - unless there is a Tor-like anonymization layer, which introduces a lot of complication. Anonymity is a giant claim, and to support it you need to have some evidence that you've thought these things through.
* Do you have any algorithms that will put a reliable view count on a video based on views from a decentralized network? If we don't know how many views each video is getting (we can't trust the server/video owners), how do we know what's popular? On a related note, how do we calculate subscriber counts in a reliable way?
* How do people discover videos? Do users need to find videos by clicking Bit451 video/userpage links on a traditional website? After they watch the video, is there some decentralized algorithm for finding related videos? If there is some decentralized version of the related videos algorithm, I don't believe anyone has discovered it yet (prove me wrong). If the uploader picks related videos by hand, most videos will have very low quality related videos.
* How will you make likes / video ratings meaningful (i.e. not spammable)? Are you going to implement some sort of web of trust so that likes from different users are weighted by reputation? If so, does this just mean that new users can't affect video ratings until they have gained reputation from users who already have rep? Making likes cost transaction fees also doesn't work, because users won't (and sometimes can't) pay to like things, no matter how small the fees are.
Until you answer these unanswered questions (which are *hard* questions, and form the quintessential heart of your project), what you have is a proposal for a decentralized video platform that doesn't have view, like, or subscriber counts, doesn't support comments, and isn't anonymous, i.e. BitTorrent.


Your idea is just that - an idea. It's not a bad one by far, but on a scale of development from zero to Picasso, your proposal is a few aesthetically pleasing lines in an empty sketchbook.
In short:
* Nobody will start coding for your project because there is no incentive (existing codebase; pay) to code for your project instead of an existing one, or their own, similar one.
* Nobody will continue work on your project proposal because there are huge gaps in your plan in the form of the above unanswered questions, that may be impossible to solve, or might not be solved within the next 10 or 20 years.
* Everyone working on the aforementioned unanswered questions will work on them and publish solutions independently from your proposal.
I hate to be so blunt, because I can relate with that feeling of idealism and "hey, let's build a decentralized YouTube!", but your project is probably impossible, and if it isn't, you need to prove to us that you've thought through the toughest parts of it. Otherwise it will stay as a loose proposal with no working code.
TL;DR I want you to succeed, but unless you (1) prove that your project is technically possible, and then (2) start the code base yourself (no one else will), your project is not going to happen.

You're actually a bit mistaken. Change only gets sent to a miner if no change address is specified at all, which only happens in practice when you create a transaction manually, *and* forget to specify a change address yourself. Every software wallet implementation I've seen will automatically specify a change address by either pulling an existing address from the wallet or generating a new address on the fly and adding it to the wallet.
So the way you get burned is this:
1. You import or sweep the entire paper wallet (for example 10BTC) into your software wallet.
2. You send 1BTC to your friend, without specifying a change address. The wallet software automatically generates a change address for you, adds it to your software wallet, and silently sends 9BTC to the change address.
3. You delete the software wallet to be secure, thinking your paper wallet has 9BTC left on it.
4. You realize that your paper wallet is empty, and the 9BTC is sitting at a change address in the wallet you just deleted (so is lost forever).

It's shockingly naive that you think Bitcoin will still have value after ECDSA has been cracked:
1. Someone discovers how to break ECDSA signatures (what this post claims, but actually for real).
2. They silently steal millions of bitcoins from reused addresses. Each one looks like an isolated private key theft. They now control an insane amount of bitcoins, and there's no way to tell how much they have or which ones are theirs.
4. Eventually the ECDSA vulnerability is published, everybody follows the same logic that I'm using right here, and realizes that one person owns most of the bitcoins.
5. Bitcoin becomes useless because most of the coins are owned by one person, but nobody knows which coins they are, so no blacklist can be put into place.

@_date: 2014-07-28 19:04:04
The problem is that Bitcoin is very young right now and not many people are using it, not that Bitcoin is inherently more difficult to obtain and use than fiat currency.
My point is that while your concerns are valid now, as Bitcoin's network effect continues to take hold, more regular people will hold and transact in Bitcoin every day, and at that point Bitcoin won't be any more difficult to transact in than any other currency.
And for the record, by "foreign currency" I mean any currency other than the one you're trying to exchange for. So with respect to Bitcoin, every other currency is a foreign currency, and same with respect to the US dollar.
So, answer to your question in short:
1) The network effect isn't there yet, but I believe it will get there.
2) The infrastructure isn't there yet, but I believe it will get there.
3) Every currency is foreign with respect to BTC. If you don't want to link your bank account to a service to exchange for BTC, the infrastructure isn't there yet, but I believe it will get there (ATMs).

This is way oversimplified. It's not nearly this easy - to change the signing algorithm means not only that (1) every wallet implementation needs to be updated to the new algorithm, (2) every miner and user of Bitcoin needs to update to an implementation that supports the new signing scheme and (3) every bitcoin address needs to be changed to reflect the new signing algorithm.
So no, we cannot "always easily" change the signing algorithm. It's doable, but it will cause a lot of friction as developers update their wallets and users generate all-new bitcoin addresses and stop using their ECDSA ones.


Changing the mining algorithm is very doable on the level of code - not that much harder than changing the signing scheme. The problem is that the change would need to be accepted by every user (hard fork), just like the signing algorithm change. Arguably miners would be less willing to change the mining algorithm, because they are already heavily invested in hardware, compared to the signing algorithm, which they have no direct stake in. However, this doesn't make changing the signing algorithm "easy" or the mining algorithm "hard". Either could feasibly happen in the case of a broken algorithm, and either would be far from frictionless.
EDIT: Furthermore, when ECDSA-breaking quantum computing is discovered, it will most likely be by a private party who will keep the technology secret. This will give them the power to silently steal any amount of bitcoin from any (previously spent from) address they want, all while the public still thinks that the technology hasn't been invented yet. Very dangerous stuff.

It's dangerous to think of mining as a perpetual stream of bitcoins, because even if you are very lucky, the hardware will only ROI moderately before it becomes obsolete due to mining difficulty. Think of it instead as placing a one-time bet that your mining hardware will arrive on time, won't fail, and that mining difficulty won't go much higher than you projected.
If you want a consistent income stream, you are much better off expanding your internet marketing thing into the Bitcoin space. The space might not quite be ready for Bitcoin yet, but you can't lose anything by offering to do deals in Bitcoin instead of USD.

@_date: 2014-08-08 17:34:30
Hash rate keeps going up, so the average Bitcoin block time is actually less than ten minutes due to the lag in network difficulty.
So for an accurate answer, you need to do all your calculations using the actual average block time, and you also need to be able to make an educated guess about the average block time in the future (which is essentially guessing what the hash rate will be).

Secondly, and just as important, if OP imported those private keys into his main wallet, he needs to remove them again immediately. Some wallets will reuse them as change addresses or receiving addresses, in which case the authorities could theoretically reach into those addresses and grab bitcoins out of his wallet.
The proper way to do this is to use the "private key sweep" function that some wallets offer, or to import the keys into a fresh throwaway wallet, use that wallet to send to your main wallet, then ditch the throwaway wallet.

Any bitcoin wallet software that runs on your PC, encrypted or not, can have funds stolen by a virus. Here's one of the ways it happens:
Unencrypted wallet:
* You accidentally download a virus, it searches your computer for your wallet, uploads it to the attacker's computer. The attacker spends all the money from your wallet to their own wallet.
Encrypted wallet:
* You accidentally download a virus, it searches your computer for your wallet, notices it's encrypted with a password, and waits.
* The next time you open your bitcoin wallet and type in your password, the virus keylogs your password.
* The virus uploads both your wallet and the password to the attacker's computer. The attacker unlocks your wallet with the password, and spends all the money from your wallet to their own wallet.
This is why it's important to keep large amounts of bitcoin in cold storage - if a computer isn't connected to the internet, you remove the main (and arguably the only practical) way that an attacker can infect your computer with rogue code.

IMO percentages are the only fair way to go. Number of units makes no sense, because each unit is arbitrary due to bitcoin's divisibility.

Sorry to hear that. They aren't kidding when they say that bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so the only way to get them back would be if the attacker gave them back to you willingly.
Of course there are legal avenues, but they are probably costly, and while I don't know a lot about the instawallet case in particular, the attacker is usually not identifiable in bitcoin thefts unless they make a mistake in covering their tracks.
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:28:05
Hot damn that is bouncy. Seems to work well though.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:18:49
This is correct, as an address' public key is not revealed until it has sent a transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:20:22
The idea is that you boot into a secure OS, like a live linux CD, install a thin wallet like Electrum (at this point it generates a wallet), import the paper wallet into Electrum, spend some bitcoin, then shut down the live linux CD, which takes out the entire linux session including electrum and its wallet. I was calling the wallet temporary because it only exists for a short time so you can import the paper wallet private key into it and spend from the paper wallet, then it gets destroyed when you shut down the live CD.
This can actually be a relatively secure method to spend from a paper wallet, as long as you avoid the relatively common [pitfall of losing your coins permanently to a change address]( (The way to avoid losing your coins is to make sure you spend the ENTIRE paper wallet in one transaction, so there isn't any left to go to a change address.)

Just as much as the telephone was, when this memo was written. The memo isn't about functionality, it's about shortcomings, of which Bitcoin has many. (Not that Bitcoin isn't still a fantastic and revolutionary new technology &lt;/appealToAudience&gt;)


Since when does the general populous think Bitcoin appears useful? We're still at &gt;90% of the world population thinking it's not useful (if they did, they would own some bitcoin).

* Step 1: Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. make private key storage against terms of service in NY, possibly even scan your uploads for unencrypted wallets (if your wallet is in an encrypted container because you're not an idiot, they can't tell it's a wallet).
* Step 2: A user gets caught with private keys anyway.
* Step 3: Dropbox removes the one, single file in the complaint.

He never said he's invested in Bitcoin, you're assuming that.


He never said he wishes for this, you're assuming that.


I don't think the blockchain is of this opinion. It was working fine when Bitcoin had almost no users, and it seems to be working fine now.


The most famous example of dollar balances being wiped was in Zimbabwe. The mechanism is hyperinflation, and it happens.


He never said he made up his mind in any way, you're assuming that.
Sounds like you've made up a caricature of what you want to believe every bitcoin user is. Realize that it's not possible for every bitcoin user to have the same beliefs. Because human beliefs are so varied, it's a no-brainer that most people on this subreddit have different and conflicting opinions. Any attempt to say "all bitcoin users believe this" is automatically going to be wrong.

Hey I want to apologize for being so rough on you. I'm just a bit frustrated because I see about 20 specification lists every month, 2 of which have any code behind them and 1 of which ends up as a viable project.
Specifically, over the last few months I have seen more than 15 different decentralized database projects, about 3 of which ended up with working proof of concept code.
That is no excuse for my behavior though - I should be encouraging these projects. By assuming they will be in the 80% that fail, I am discouraging the 20% that yield useful results.
On a related note, a lot of people expect that they will get free help from developers if they post specifications for a decentralized product. Good developers that will make your project for you for free are not that easy to come by. If you are a decent developer as you say, then 75% of the battle is over. To gain some respect, just start some code!
TL;DR We really want you to succeed, but you haven't shown us you have any of the resources. We've seen thousands of hats - show us your cattle.

This is definitely not how it works. Blocks can only be created by solving a hash, and the hash solution doesn't care how many transactions have been sent since the last block. Average block times are completely unaffected by transaction volume.

Yes. If I ask you to special-order an apple pie for me for $7 and I promise to buy it tomorrow, then tomorrow the apple pie is worth $4 and I decide I don't want it anymore, then I am stealing $3 from you.
You have lost $3 in value (your $7 pie now resells for $4), and I have gained $3 by breaking my promise and not buying the apple pie for $7.
Edit: a word

What are you talking about? BTCs changed hands (from an exchange to Coinbase) as soon as he clicked the 'buy' button. Then when he cancelled the transaction, Coinbase was at a $20,000 loss.

@_date: 2015-01-27 02:08:33
Let's try this from a different angle. Say you sell apple pies for $7. I place an order for an apple pie from you for $7 with a check (a check is a promise of future payment from my bank account). You make the apple pie for later that day, then I cancel the check.
I was the only buyer for that fresh apple pie. You are completely okay with the fact that you spent $5 on ingredients that you will never get back. Even though the pie is now worthless (you have directly lost $5 because of my bounced check), you have "not lost any value because you still have a pie".
Edit: I want to shop at your apple pie store, seriously. I'll order an apple pie every day. When the apple pie market is up, I'll resell your apple pies to my own profit. When the apple pie market is down, I'll cancel yesterday's check so you get shafted for today's pie and I'm never out any money. When do you plan to set up shop?

Bitcoin is not yet to a point where a sizable fraction of retailers take Bitcoin (and the ones that do advertise it prominently), so your question doesn't serve any purpose as a question because you know the answer will practically always be no.
Asking the cashier "Do you take Bitcoin" with the pretext of them accepting Bitcoin is the same as asking them "Have you accepted your savior Jesus Christ" with the pretext of getting them to read a bible. It's not a question with a useful answer, it's not even a question, in both cases it's just evangelism phrased as a question.
So I would either stop asking that question until it's actually useful, or just grow a pair and ask the cashier  directly: "Have you or your manager considered accepting Bitcoin for payment?"
By the way, this subreddit is an echo chamber so everyone else is going to tell you you don't sound like a dick. To get a better sample, ask your friends and family whether you sound like a dick when you say that to cashiers, and I'm sure you'll get much more mixed results.

Either I'm missing your point, or you fundamentally misunderstand how blocks are created. Blocks aren't mined only when they're "full", they're mined constantly regardless of how many transactions there are.
It's not like a bucket filling up and getting shipped out when it's full. It's more like a bucket starts filling and thousands of people race to be the first to dump it out, with no regards to the water level.

Tweaking parameters is neither impressive nor difficult, but it can definitely be valuable. In fact, it is so valuable that many Bitcoin miners and users are on board with the 2MB change.
Those same users would not be quite so on-board with switching from Bitcoin to Litecoin, which is why Litecoin doesn't hold nearly as much value to me as Classic.

Neither sub is a "serious cryptocurrency forum", they are both just subreddits. They both have memes and low effort posts, and they both have their issues.
You gotta stop thinking of things so black and white and trying to defend one or the other as perfect, when it's plainly obvious that neither one is.
Edit: That being said, everyone should try participating in both to see which one they like better. Because as much as people from each one would have you believe otherwise, it's really a choice that every person should make for themselves.

They didn't. The only objectively measurable metric for whether they're winning is hash rate, which is still increasing day by day.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:12:37
It's not mutually exclusive - I just don't think there's any reason to clutter up the subreddit with general libertarian news, because there's already so many places to get that.
The way I would have it, would be about discussing ONLY things that relate to Bitcoin in some way, and anybody who wants libertarian news can subscribe to which covers many of the same topics.
I find it weird and even disconcerting that has such a huge political bent. It's like, I came here to talk about a piece of software, and if it has political implications then sure fine let's talk about how Bitcoin relates to them, but don't just make a general political dumping ground for stuff that's not about Bitcoin, yknow?
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:35:43
Exactly. Only part of it is due to technical merit, the other part is people launching DDoS attacks against anything that isn't consensus compatible with Core.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:26:37
Core devs don't own Bitcoin just because they have been working on it the longest. That's like saying I own my community garden because I grew most of the plants.
Bitcoin belongs to the community, and whatever the majority of the community supports becomes Bitcoin.

Not true. Back when the price was about $7, this place was full of good discussion. It started its very slow side to shit around when Mt.

That's your opinion, and mass opinion begets nomenclature.
If the majority of people agree with you, the resulting fork will not be called Bitcoin. If the majority of people disagree with you, the resulting fork will be called Bitcoin.
I tend to think that BU will not try to fork unless it has majority approval, so I don't think there's any situation where they would successfully fork but that the resulting chain would not be Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-23 18:17:39
By your definition every SHA256 altcoin is not an altcoin, but a fork of Bitcoin. I would add the additional definition that a fork needs to have the same genesis block. Of course in the theoretically unlikely event of SHA256 getting compromised in the future **and** Bitcoin switching hashing algorithms, then the new Bitcoin fork would be an altcoin under your definition.
Come to think of it, I prefer the genesis block definition. If a coin shares some amount of early blocks with a more popular coin, then that coin is a fork and not an altcoin.

Thanks for asking!
Instead of these options, which I feel aren't very clear (and leave users wondering about the difference between "Network minimum" and "1x minimum"):
    Network minimum (free to you)
    1x minimum (slow)
    2x minimum (less slow)
    etc.
I would instead break the dropdown menu into multiple sections, making the difference between the first two options more clear/explicit:
    Coinkite pays
        Network minimum (slow)
    You pay
        Network minimum (slow)
        2x minimum (less slow)
        3x minimum (faster)
        5x minimum (very fast)
        etc.
This makes it so the user doesn't have to guess the difference between the first two options or dig up the blog post. They know that the first two options are exactly the same, except in one case they are paying for it.
I know there is an easy way to construct menu subheaders in HTML - if there isn't a semantic way to do it, I seem to remember that you can make `option` elements that are disabled.
That's my 2 cents.

Using thin blocks of some sort makes this problem go away, because then blocks reference all the transactions that the nodes have already downloaded just by listening on the network.

Now that Bitcoin has been reported on by all major news agencies, and it's on the radar of so many wealthy individuals, $1 Bitcoins would mean something very different than it did back then.
Think about if Bitcoin had a market cap of only $21,000,000 today - it would be tempting for a rich person to corner the market, or to perform a 51% attack since the hash rate will have gone down due to reduced profitability.
Bitcoin is officially a thing now, and if Bitcoin were weakened from the current price down to $1, it might not be difficult for someone with the right motives and enough money and power to deliver the coup de grace.

If SegWit never activates, the reason that miners opposed it literally won't matter. You say they oppose it for the wrong reasons? Doesn't matter. They oppose it, so it doesn't exist. As soon as they stop opposing it, then it's on the table.
Also, SegWit doesn't even do anything regarding on-chain scaling, so when it's passed, transaction fees won't go any lower (well, they will go from maybe $10 to $6 each because SegWit increases the effective block size transaction limit to 1.7MB).
To increase on-chain capacity, a hard-fork is needed. It will not be put into effect until it has majority miner and exchange support, so almost by definition the fork itself is not risky.
Finally, I would recommend you stop randomly bolding words and using "**!!!**" and "**???**", that way you would probably gain some more credibility.

Of course they would have some BTC liquid to facilitate this, but I guarantee they aren't keeping everyone's full USD balances in BTC.

That's correct, but keep in mind that if plans change and you need access to that money, there's no legal loophole.

I listened to each of those groups long enough to figure out what they were trying to say, and how their arguments were structured. I didn't just take everyone's word that they were wrong.
It's impossible to find the truth without going into every argument with an open mind. Also, there are kernels of truth even in the worst argument, and you can be smarter for having listened to it with a critical ear.
Plus, no Bitcoin argument is really like those groups. Thinking like that divides the community unnecessarily and keeps us from coming up with compromises and moving forward.

I might define "effectively zero" as "a price that puts Bitcoin's market cap below where it could be easily manipulated by a single  reasonably wealthy entity". So for instance, if someone with a net worth of say $50 million (of which there are many) could easily fully control the price of Bitcoin, then I would say its price is "effectively zero".
At that point, trust in Bitcoin would be lost until its price goes back up, because its price could be controlled single-handedly by just about any "rich person".
The reason this wasn't a problem when Bitcoin was rising in price is that it wasn't well-known at all. Now the cat's out of the bag.

Here are the reasons why I think none of your three points say anything about the legitimacy of Mastercoin.
1) It is disingenuous to say that they "let" people generate Mastercoins, when what they did in reality was to *sell* them at a fixed price for real (bitcoin) money. This doesn't take away from its credibility, but it doesn't lend any either. It just means that Mastercoin is now a commercial project.
2) If I am not mistaken, they have not handed out very many of these bounty bitcoins yet. If you do work for them, there is no guarantee of payment, the amount of money you get for your contribution is "up to their discretion". In my opinion, having salaried devs would be a much more genuine way to approach the problem.
3) The only reason that Mastercoin contributions are open-sourced is because if they weren't, the project would fail, and the creator knows that. It is open-sourced because the creator has no other choice.
Again, this doesn't necessarily discredit Mastercoin, but it does show that none of your points legitimize it in any way.

If a transaction takes more than a day or two to make it into a block, miners will begin to forget the transaction (they keep limited pools of unconfirmed transactions in memory). Also, plenty of clients other than Bitcoin-qt will let you send transactions with low enough priority that they won't ever get included in a block by a miner following the normal rules.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:51:38
I'm going to give you some extremely simplified answers, and warn you that firsthand research is the best way for you to get info about all this.


Basically everybody saw Bitcoin rise, they jumped on board to "get rich quick", increasing the price and making it look like a better investment to others. It was a feedback loop that just kept feeding itself until it suddenly didn't. The thing that popped it was Mt.Gox effectively going down for a day because of DDOS attacks and not enough server capacity. The exchange infrastructure is slowly improving, but it wouldn't surprise me if another bubble like this happens again.


Yes, with a LOT of assumptions. There are lots of things that could make the price go down and there is always the possibility that you could lose all your money. Things that would be bad for Bitcoin off the top of my head: Misregulation by governments, one or more exchanges going out of business, compromise in the protocol (in the encryption, mining process etc.) So if you think there isn't any risk in holding bitcoins right now, then you are deluding yourself. On the other hand, there is still a lot of potential for making money.


No, 99% of this subreddit would agree that the Bitcoin exchange rate is not stable enough to keep a sizable amount of your savings in. At this point Bitcoin is a money transfer tool and a speculative investment. Don't put in more than you can afford to lose, whether through failures in the system or possible user-error. Bitcoins are slippery little things, and they will find their way into someone else's wallet if your computer ever gets bitcoin-related malware, or if your exchange account ever gets hacked.


It is, for now! Personally I think we are a little overbought though and that Bitcoin could lose as much as 10-15% value over the next couple weeks. If you put money into Bitcoin right now and it goes up, you could stand to make a lot. But if Bitcoin goes down, then you are screwed out of that money without any recourse - don't say I didn't warn you!
I personally have a relatively large percentage of my worth in Bitcoin, but if it were entirely gone tomorrow I would be able to continue living the lifestyle that I do. Ask yourself, if all of my bitcoins were gone tomorrow, how would I react? If the answer is "panic" or "cry" or "start taking on credit card debt", then you have invested too much, as many a poor soul on this subreddit have found out the hard way.
The bottom line is, don't delude yourself into thinking that Bitcoin investing = free money. Sure, there is money to be made, but it comes with a LOT of strings attached.

What you are thinking of is Bitcoin **m-of-n transactions**. Basically if you have 5 family members total, then you can make a 3-of-5 bitcoin address. All 5 people have their own private key, and any funds movements requires signatures from at least 3 of those keys. Unfortunately, while these types of transactions are fully supported on the Bitcoin network, there are no major clients that make them easy to work with.
In contrast, Shamir's Secret Sharing is not a good match here, all it does is let you split one private key among everybody. When you bring the private key back together with the 3-of-5 pieces that you need, any one of you could do anything with that key. That means that any time you want to make a transaction, everybody would need to be in the same room to make sure there aren't any shenanigans.
At this point in Bitcoin's development I would heavily recommend splitting the bitcoins amongst everybody. That means that the worst damage any of them can do is with their own share, and you won't have to deal with these complicated m-of-n transactions.
If you want some more info on m-of-n, there is also someone who has an answer on Stackexchange:

ACH is the name of the standard electronic bank transaction in the US. If it isn't a debit card transaction, isn't a check deposit, and isn't a wire transfer, then 99% chance it is an ACH transaction.

We're not ready quite yet. We need more small and medium sized businesses accept Bitcoin -&gt; more people using Bitcoin -&gt; more of a market incentive for larger companies to accept bitcoin.
1. Bitcoin exchange infrastructure catches up in a few months, so that the largest exchanges also have great liquidity
2. More small and medium sized businesses accept Bitcoin because it's easy to
3. More people use Bitcoin because it's accepted at more places
4. Large businesses have a financial incentive to pay their lawyers and accountants to learn about Bitcoin, because there is finally enough people using it
Because to be honest, if Walmart started accepting Bitcoin right now, they would stand to lose a lot of money on operating procedures, legal training and employee training, not to mention they would have to rely on Bitpay or Coinbase, which are both startup-size companies

Your point about adaptability is well taken, but I don't think this particular idea works. The Bitcoin history can't be deleted because it's already on everyone's computers. Also, there is no great way to anonymize the coins, or we would already be using it.
IMO the problem essentially boils down to "how can we tie coins to their previous addresses, so that everyone still owns the same amount of coins, but without tying coins to their previous addresses, so that all coins lose their history?" which is itself a contradiction.

Think of Bitcoin as each address having a balance.
When someone sends bitcoin to one of your receiving addresses, that address gets a balance. Your total wallet balance is equal to the total of all your receiving address balances.
When you send bitcoin from your wallet, it uses the balance from some or all of your receiving addresses to construct the transaction. Therefore there is a direct link from whichever addresses it used to whichever address you send your bitcoins to.
Does that answer your question?

Do not do this if you are using a live cd. Make sure you send the change back to the paper wallet in the same transaction as you take some out, not a separate one, so that if your computer loses power the coins won't be permanently stuck in the temporary change address.

Short answer: Yes, you should update unless you have a good reason not to.
Long answer: Possibly, but nothing that will harm your coins unless you have enabled RPC, and also if your wallet asks to rescan the blockchain it probably won't work and you will have to apply a workaround to get it to start again normally.

Construct the raw transaction, confirm it with the user, and then [send it using blockchain.info's raw transaction API](
Also, I am pretty sure blockexplorer.com has an api that does the same thing (brainwallet.org uses either one for broadcasting transactions - redundancy and whatnot).
I would agree though that it's best if the average end-user is never exposed to the raw transaction itself.
Edit: I see what you mean, because the user would need to pass the transaction around to gain m signatures.

When people buy bitcoins, the price goes up - when people sell bitcoins, the price goes down. Think supply and demand, just like gold value - it's not too tough once you get the idea.
Asking whether bitcoins will go up or down in value is equivalent to asking whether bitcoin will be more or less successful in the future than it is today. Nobody can tell you with certainty, but the general sentiment in this subreddit is that in general Bitcoin will continue gaining popularity in the foreseeable future.

Now that Asics are commercially available for Bitcoin, I would argue that Bitcoin is more secure than Litecoin against a 51% attack by an adversary, at least one with enough money to afford their own chip fabrication plant.
If a government wanted to overtake either one they would build Asics to do so. Attacking Litecoin would be Asic vs Gpu, whereas Bitcoin would be Asic vs Asic. And if you argue that Asics for Litecoin can't be built or wouldn't be efficient, please explain further because that's pretty much untrue from what I understand.
Of course if a government built Bitcoin Asics then they couldn't turn around and attack Litecoin with the same hardware, so maybe that's a plus.
Edit: I know about Scrypt's memory requirements, but wouldn't it be easy enough to build an Asic with enough memory?

I don't think dust inputs taint priority quite like you imagine. [Source](
They decrease the priority a little, because they increase your transaction's size in bytes without substantially increasing BTC transacted. However, you should be able to take a high priority input and add some dust inputs without significantly decreasing the transaction's priority.

Whoever has the most hashrate wins, actually. The idea is similar, but remember that the fundamental unit of Bitcoin computation is a hash, not a flop.
I would be much more worried about a government creating bitcoin mining machines than using their existing supercomputers, because as exasperation [posted below]( a supercomputer doesn't have enough hashrate to attack the network.
As for governments creating bitcoin mining equipment, I don't see much stopping them at this point. I think that Bitcoin is safe for now because it is mostly still under the radar, and a government doesn't have enough of a reason to attack it yet.

Let's take a crack at it, shall we? [Wolfram Alpha]( is a perfect calculator to handle those numbers with.
Let's overestimate the amount of addresses generated, just so my estimate has some leeway. Let's say 1 billion bitcoin users generate 1 billion addresses each per second. 1B x 1B = 1x10^18 addresses per second. There are 3.156x10^10 seconds in a millennium, but let's give ourselves 10 millenia (10,000 years) to wait for a collision.
If we multiply (10^8) x (3.156x10^10) x (10) we get 3.156x10^19. By dividing that by the total number of possible bitcoin addresses, 2^160, we get the percentage of the address space that will be generated in the next 10,000 years given our assumptions.
In the next 10,000 years we will have generated .000000000000000000000000003% of the total address space.
Those are the odds that no one will ever generate an address that has money in it.

While 2-factor authentication is a great security feature, I'm not sure it would have helped you if you weren't paying attention, and if the phishing site were crafted expertly enough.
Attack is as follows: You enter your password, then your 2-factor code into the phishing site, and the phishing server immediately makes a connection to the real site with your real code, gaining access to your account.
Of course they only get your coins if you have 2-factor set for login and not also for bitcoin withdrawal (unless the site is more sophisticated, and for instance, asks you to input your 2-factor a second time because it was "invalid" the first time).
It was good that you were paying attention!

The fundamental problem is that credit card purchases are reversible, whereas bitcoin payments are completely irreversible. This makes it so credit card fraud runs rampant on the bitcoin scene, which means that most exchanges don't support credit cards.

Think of bitcoins as internet gold that you can exchange for US dollars. The gold rush (mining) is already long past, so the only two ways to get bitcoins now are to buy them using USD or to earn them.
How do you earn bitcoins? Same way as you earn US dollars. Find someone who wants a job done and is willing to pay. Bitcoin is not a magical money making machine - it is just a foreign currency that originated on the internet. The only way to make money directly is to buy them and sit on them if you think their market value will continue to appreciate against the dollar.
Does this help? Bitcoin is a currency, possibly even a long-term investment, but not easy money.

Why consolidate dust? I think that the difficulty in spending it is a great incentive to not create it in the first place.

The easiest way to purchase Bitcoin from a US bank account is through coinbase.com. They will up your purchase limit after a 30 day waiting period, so if you go this route, you will want to get it linked to your bank account so you can start that period.
For locally selling Bitcoin in Europe, there are a few options. Use Bitstamp to cash out Bitcoin for European bank transfers, or Localbitcoins.com to sell for cash.
Alternatively, you should consider just paying the $3 + 1% or whatever to withdraw funds from your US account to a foreign ATM, or ask your banks how you can get money into Europe via wire transfer (not as much my field of expertise).

Basically, the way the Bitcoin network works is that when you want to make a transaction, it goes through a few steps:
1. You create and broadcast the transaction (0-confirmations)
2. Everyone in the network including the miners receive your transaction (0-confirmations)
3. Whenever the miners feel like it, they include your transaction in the newest Bitcoin block (1-confirmation)
4. The miners mine another block on top of the block with your transaction (2-confirmations)
5. The miners mine another block on top of that block (3-confirmations)
6. The miners mine another block on top of that block (4-confirmations)
And so forth. A transaction is considered "final" (that is, permanently in the block chain) when it has reached a certain amount of confirmations (typically 6).
This process happens for every transaction in the network. Does the explanation help any?

Bitcoin never settling in value is a consequence that arises from believing that Bitcoin will not continue to grow (which is a reasonable belief to have, but by far not the only possible outcome). In the hypothetical event that Bitcoin becomes widely accepted as a currency, it will stabilize in purchasing power (more or less) just as the US dollar has. This is because supply will remain fixed and demand will remain more or less constant.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:29:08

Yes, though this is an inconsequential distinction.

The way they explain the protocol, that is not just possible, but expected. All they do is create an escrow-traded coin that tracks the price of the US dollar. Then they back the fund with Mastercoins and it auto-balances to fix the price of that coin to the dollar.
That is, if you can believe that it's actually possible to track prices this way. After reading the whitepaper I am about 90% sure that their methods are inherently economically flawed, but hey, that's just my opinion - we'll see how it turns out.

Why are we donating to a dismissive dick? If this is a thing now, maybe I should take a crack at it:
"I think bitcoins are stupid and I'm not going to accept them. If someone tries to give me a tip right now I will tell them that their beliefs are stupid and pointless."
Maybe someone is going to think "I'd better show him" and then give me a tip.

Technically that increases continuously, not in jumps, because hash power needed for a 51% attack follows the total network hashrate (which is gradual), not the difficulty (which jumps).

QR codes have built in redundancy. Depending on how much redundancy it had built in, you can recover a qr code's entire message (no bruteforce even) using only 3/4 of the qr code intact.
Alternatively, there may be a math whiz who can piece together the private key using the QR code and remaining private key part.
Good luck, I would guess it's technically recoverable given the section of QR code and key you posted, though it would take a ton of math and a dash of brute force.
What I can guarantee though is that there are a dozen people trying to recover your key right now, and only 1 or 2 are planning to give you the money back if they find it. I would take it down from this post immediately if I were you.
Edit: Okay yeah it's pretty messed up, I wouldn't worry too much about people finding it.

Government IPs can't be blocked because of the mesh topology of the network. Force-mine X transactions wouldn't accomplish anything except get the feds to spam dummy transactions. Also, the force-mining rule would hard fork the network, so it would be difficult to deploy in a short time frame.

Basically the attacker can build the longest chain and reject everyone else's blocks. A Bitcoin 51% attack can be executed using half of the mining power - the same thing can be done in a proof-of-stake coin using half the currency units.
Here's a stackexchange topic on what an attacker can do with 51%. Again, same things apply for proof-of-stake, but using currency units instead of hashpower:

What murbul said, and to answer your question of stealing, that's something you have to ask yourself. I'm not sure if there's a consensus here on whether it's right to take coins from dead-easy brainwallets, nevertheless nobody is going to tell you not to except for yourself.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:09:36
Short answer: You're right, it's not safe.
Long answer: People already have scripts to do this automatically, so don't expect to find any by hand. And if you are thinking of using a brainwallet, ONLY use one that has been properly randomly generated, such that it's impossible for a hacker to just guess.

A 51% attacker cannot arbitrarily change the difficulty, because using any difficulty other than the consensus would cause their blocks to be perceived as invalid to the rest of the network.

Here are just a couple of your points that I think don't agree with how the Bitcoin network and software actually work.


If it were possible right now to make Bitcoins untraceable, it would have already been added to the source code.


How could you expect to get non-redlisted coins out of a mixer?


The validation program is independent from the Bitcoin protocol - it just scans the block chain and categorizes coins / addresses.
I do agree though that one of the reasons it won't work is because the US is so small compared to the entire rest of the world, and even if there is a US redlist, the redlisted coins will probably hold their value in other countries.

By saying that rewards are being exhausted before they were "supposed to", you are essentially saying that network hash rate was never "supposed to" increase.
Personally, I think there's no reason to think that. I think that even if Satoshi didn't foresee the hashrate increase himself, that the protocol is robust enough for it not to matter.
TL;DR It's kind of arbitrary to say when the block reward was "supposed to" be exhausted, it's really just a point of semantics.

I never said that saving drives the bitcoin economy or that spending doesn't. All I am saying is that saving bitcoin is also beneficial to the system, albeit in a different way than spending is.
There is no trade between gold and goods/services, yet gold still functions (arguably) reasonably well as a store of value, because people hold it. If nobody held gold then gold value would be more volatile and worth a lot less. If nobody held bitcoin then bitcoin value would be more volatile and worth a lot less.
Saving Bitcoin is good for the system in one way. Spending Bitcoin is good for the system in another.

If you average over the two week adjustment period, miners actually get the same amount of coins divided between them regardless of difficulty. This is because the block rate always readjusts itself back to 10 minutes.
You actually can't talk about a lower bitcoin supply without talking about block reward halving, or at least a massive drop in hashrate.
@_date: 2013-09-24 06:15:14
This is more or less what mixers like [Blockchain.info Shared Send]( and the Silk Road Wallet do.
It's not a bad idea, but since the operator gets control of the coins, it's better just to go through a reputable mixer. Also there are some trustless p2p versions like [CoinJoin]( starting to pop up.
So yeah, the Bitcoin community is busy working on that :)

To clarify, you are saying you have a balance in Bitcoin-qt that you sent off to a web wallet, and you don't recognize the sending address for the transaction, right? If so, I think I might know what's going on.
Bitcoin-qt manages extra addresses for you (called "change addresses") that it doesn't display to you. It's very possible that when you sent your payment, some or all of it came from one of these hidden addresses.
Bitcoin-qt creates these hidden change addresses automatically by default, you can read more here if you are curious:
From what I hear so far, this is what I think probably happened - if you have any more questions, I'm still here.

I would not rely on just private keys, because unless you know exactly what you're doing, you have a possibility of losing all your coins:
Most wallets send funds to a new address/private key every time you make a payment. A lot of the time this new "change" address is hidden from the user.
I would be very careful about relying on just private keys for backup, because with bitcoin-qt for instance, some or all of your bitcoins can go to a change address that you haven't backed up, and then you're screwed.
It is not quite as straightforward as you think, and I really don't want you to lose any coins! If you want to back up an entire wallet (forever) on paper, I might recommend sending your funds to Electrum and then printing out the electrum wallet seed.

The wiki is kind of misleading, because it is not possible to raise the transaction limit without every Bitcoin user's participation, and there are reasons why raising the limit might be a bad thing.
As the block reward dwindles, miners will be encouraged to mine via transaction fees. If we aren't bumping up against the transaction limit by then, there will be no incentive to attach significant fees to transactions to get them into the blockchain, which will result in less of an incentive to mine, making the network weaker.
I fully believe that the future of Bitcoin as a means of commerce will be mainly in off-chain transactions within the networks of a few global payment processors. Use of the blockchain will entail significant fees, and will become the "wire transfer" of settlement funds between large institutions, and of large amounts of funds between individuals.
I'm not telling it how I think it should be, but how I see it becoming.

Zerocoin is sort of close to what we would need, and I imagine its unreasonable space requirements would not be so unreasonable if everyone mixed their coins only once, to change to the new chain.
