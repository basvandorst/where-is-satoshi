I created a whole new account just to counter your stupid bullshit with facts instead of merely down voting everything you write. (Don't worry, I'm still down voting every comment you make without exception on this account and my main, so you're gonna be karma-banned soon enough.)
Bitcoins make a **great** store of value because their **value always increases.** Think about it for a second, if you're even capable of it: You put a hundred dollars in a savings account, and I put a hundred dollars into bit coin. After a year, what's your savings worth? $90, because it lost *ten percent* of its value to inflation. After you pay taxes on it, it's worth even less, because the government sends you a big bill to pay just for having the audacity to have money. Meanwhile, what's my bit coin worth? *Thousands of dollars.* Because bit coins grow in value over time, as more people get wise to how great they are.
The longer you stay involved in the stupid-ass dollar economy, the more you lose. You lose to inflation (a slow collapse) and you lose to government theft through taxation. Meanwhile, my money's worth more and more all the time.
Which one of us is stupid now?

The price floor for bit coins is whatever the price is right now. It only goes up over time, never down.

*They* report that inflation is 2% a year. It's a bullshit lowball propaganda number put out by the banksters. Look at your own checking account to see the truth.
And people spend bit coins today because they want to buy things. Same reason anybody spends money. Spending won't stop because savings stop being robbed by the thieving banksters.

Look at your checking account! You're losing more than two percent of your savings every *month,* not every year! Get your head out of the sand and stop being a sucker for banker propaganda. Throwing around banker jargon like "nominal terms" is just another type of banker propaganda. Stop being a tool.

Downvoted for being a fucking jew banker shill, just like you always are. Fuck off.

No, I created another account to insult *him.* I'm sick of seeing his shit on this sub, so I made another account to dv all his comments with. He needs to be karma banned.
