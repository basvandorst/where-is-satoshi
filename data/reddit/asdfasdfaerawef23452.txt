Good call. Could be! I'll have to look into it. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:14:33
Well, yeah duh.
 
Why would you not immediately transfer any coins received through non-blockchain transactions (physical exchange of paper wallet, for example)?


Stand by it all you want. It is still wrong, and worse yet, actually harms people who are attempting to really understand the protocol.

Please type "how to cold storage bitcoin" into Google. Look through the results, read everything and then go for it.

By take I meant relieved you of the keys. Such that I effectively am the only one who is aware of what the priv/pub keys are.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:20:02
That is a fair point. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:16:02
Well, kind of. If you do that and my bank decides that on that day they like me, I have recourse. I can make (in reality, beg) the bank investigate and reclaim my stolen funds.

Effectively "gone forever".

My point was that on the assumption that the paper wallet is only in the possession of one person, it is in fact "your bitcoin". 
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:55:07
Yes. You are correct to assert that the physical paper does not guarantee sole access. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:11:41
Well I'll give you the credit until I see otherwise. I have a vague memory of a standup comedian saying something very similar. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:10:44
If you generated the wallet personally, for cold storage purposes, you could consider it ownership.

If by being locked out, you mean can "do" absolutely nothing with the house, and no one else can ever "do" anything with the house, then yes, it has disappeared.

It's not a terrible analogy. Though you are doing a disservice by making the analogy to "banks","dollars" and "account credentials" because these things are fundamentally different than the aspects of bitcoin you are relating to them. 
Banks != the blockchain, bitcoin != fiat currency, private key != account credentials. 
It isn't all that scary to just accept the new ideas that cryptocurrencies introduce. No need to relate them to "old world" financial systems, because they just don't compare adequately. Your analogy is not "wrong" per se, but it isn't "right" either.

He is implying that there is still more "bitcoin devastation" to come out of China in the near future and the price will go even lower.

You can get a Walmart giftcard with Gyft now. Look for anything labeled "Great Value".
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:57:06
Fair points. I can't really disagree with anything that you have said. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:25:20
Yeah that is reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:41:35
I love this saying. Is it original? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:13:30
Please elaborate! 
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:22:07
Actually, no. A paper wallet that has the private key + public key is, in fact, your bitcoin. If I take your paper wallet, I now have your bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:55:54
That is a good distinction to make. Very good point!
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:53:20
Yeah it is on the list. Also possible to buy heroin with most any fiat currency. You also could potentially find someone willing to sell heroin for chickens. 
Heck, I would trust bitcoin less if you couldn't buy heroin with it.

The actual bitcoins are represented by the paper. The private key, which allows you to spend the inputs, directly allows you to control the bitcoins.  Comparing a deed + house, to priv key + transaction is not a valid (or very useful) analogy. 
Also: If you destroy the deed to your house. The house remains. No problems there. If you destroy all of your priv. keys, the btc associated with them are gone forever. The priv. key IS effectively the coins. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:30:44
Sure thing. But you are still wrong about most of your assertions, and in your posts you come across as immature and unreasonable.
