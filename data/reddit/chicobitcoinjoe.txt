So I run a partial client at home that downloads all transactions needed to verify each block and then deletes unneeded transactions to save space. The main limitation is bandwidth. With a dedicated 24Mbps connection it would still be possible to have gigabyte sized blocks or around 3000tx/s. Obviously this is a far cry from visa levels but not bad for a decentralized network.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:49:13
Yes you can. Spv clients validate *only relevant transactions* rather than *every* transaction.

So far so good.


Why don't you create a competing business to help decentralize nodes further?


Can you say for certain he doesn't have a node running at his private residence?


ftfy. 


Plain false. If bitcoin ever has these "late adopters" than bitcoin will be accepted practically everywhere. **Any** new business (bitcoin or not) would be crazy not to accept one of the most widely used currencies in the world. It would be the equivalent of not accepting cash today.


So obviously don't implement a block size that is infinite.

It's the exact opposite of centralization. Every person becomes responsible for their own transactions and storage needed.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:40:53
Alternatively, miners will start "priority services" by offering to put transactions at the top of the queue for a fee. Not sure if this can be acheived trustlessly. My gut says no.
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:04:57
Every order placed on the exchange increments a nonce. When placing an order you define a tolerance for placing your order. Current nonce + 1 would mean your order must be the very next order or it does nothing. So either your order is placed under conditions you accept or someone else with nonce +1 payed a higher fee and takes the spot. Nonce +2 would be less safe but reduces some chances of dishonesty.

From my understanding of how proof of work functions, basic validation insures I won't be duped by invalid new blocks even with a headers first method (meaning I don't need to know all transactions in the block). If this is the case, individual users could easily* run their own spv clients on their phones. When doing peer to peer transactions the phones would quickly validate over nfc (since each phone has exactly the information needed). For non p2p uses the relevant block info would be downloaded and then verified. The ultimate decentralization for storing the blockchain.

I see technology keeping pace with the demand for more bandwidth per user and storage  already is and will continue to be insanely cheap. By 2030 it is entirely possible we could be carrying "2015 datacenters" in our pockets. So in a way you may be more right than you know.

I know more about contracts in Ethereum as opposed to bitcoin but I assume it can be done with bitcoin as well. In this case, your wallet is itself a contract with a white list of addresses allowed to withdraw once every 30 days for a specified amount.

The stress test was a very short duration *test*. Not nearly as long or of the same calibur a real attacker could do. Raising the blocksize still requires a hardfork. I was merely trying to point out that in the event of an attack, miners would have **more** incentive to increase the blocksize.

The world currently needs a way to send large amounts of money anywhere in the world cheaply. The world also needs a way to send fractions of a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world cheaply. By keeping the block size small, bitcoin can fulfill only one of the two needs. By making the block size bigger bitcoin can do both. It is possible to scale block size infinitely while maintaining consensus despite your concerns. I will follow whichever bitcoin fork fulfills both needs.

A miner would always prefer a smaller blocksize due to propagation rates being slower for large blocks thus increasing chances of the block being orphaned. In theory if blocksize ever increase to 100mb+ then hobby nodes will struggle with bandwidth but at 20mb blocks a vast majority of nodes will still operate just fine even if every block is completely full. This garbage data scenario is a dos issue and that very issue is not solved even with 1mb blocks.

Just because you haven't seen technical papers on it doesn't make my claims false. I'm telling you, it's possible in Ethereum, and Counter party forked ethereum, so the same functionality should be possible with bitcoin (unless I'm misunderstanding Counter party which is possible). Contracts are **not** wallets. They don't have private keys but rather specialized rules that dictate when, where, and how bitcoins can move. Your second point is only true if your first point is true... And it's not.
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:15:04
You used literally wrong. Segwit sf doesn't fix malleability or the  quadratic problem at all for normal txs. These txs can still be used by anyone including attackers. A hard fork would change the tx format to only Segwit which would be much safer and actually solve the problems claimed to be solved by a soft fork.

Several benefits. 
1. Users could still make use of all the cool bitcoin use cases (send money anywhere, cheap, multisig, smart contracts... Etc) 
2. Users can see exactly where government money goes, how much is created
3. Most importantly, users can see exactly when the government breaks the rules (print more money than said, reversing/blocking transactions) and then realise bitcoin has all the above upsides and fewer downsides.

Users do not rely on miners to keep funds safe. Whether it is in cold storage, a hot wallet, or in transit via a transaction, miners can NEVER steal coins and therefore no counterparty risk exists. They only exist to process new transactions by adding them to new blocks and collect block rewards and transactions fees for doing so.

You don't understand how Bitcoin works. Even if mining is done in data centers Bitcoins are still sent peer to peer. This is because Miners never have control of the the users Bitcoin at any point. 
Now let's say mining has been centralized so much so that only 5 countries (highly unlikely) in the world have running data centers mining Bitcoin. As long as a single one of those data centers is honest (not colluding) than any person in the entire world can broadcast a tx and it will eventually be included in the block chain.
Even in a dire and hostile environment Bitcoin still works. Throw in free market incentives and competition and Bitcoin will never become that centralized.

In the grand scheme of things we cannot predict how much global hash power plants may have. But if it is only ever say 5 percent than the block time won't be hit too hard. 
Power Plants can potentially be used to make block times more predictable by turning on progressively more miners as the blocktime approaches 10 minutes. I'm not sure if the economic incentives of this make sense now but perhaps they will in the future.

What you describe is exactly why Core is losing hashrate. Core the client cannot handle consensus as demanded by about 40 percent of Miner hashrate and 10 percent of clients. The AD setting allows users to determine their own sensitivity to following the most proof of work in regards to blocksize. Unlike in the misinformation spread around about BU, if more then 21 million coins are minted that is not a valid block and would be orphaned. 
Edit: Core the developers refuse to develop the features as desired by users (Miners are users too!) and as such BU was born. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:24:37
Users still own private keys and still need software to create txs based on those private keys. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:12:42
Bitcoin has soft forked to a higher blocksize many times from 0mb to 1mb. BU is only a client that hard forks once to allow soft forking the blocksize anywhere between a lower limit of 0mb and a maximum based on what the network can handle based on orphan rates **or** what the users will tolerate before hardforking to a new PoW.
These free market limits will keep Bitcoin healthy for years if we can remove the 1mb wall inhibiting growth. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 03:44:01
By choosing the software they run just like it has always been since the day Bitcoin was released. 
Let me clear by saying I don't think Bitcoin will ever reach that point. I think Bitcoin will scale on chain until LN reaches maturity and then we will see a gradual blocksize reduction until LN users peak and at no point will an average Internet not be sufficient to handle it.

Voting with your wallet is what Miners do with their hardware. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:00:17
Right. With BU the upgrade process will be fairly identical with a difference that larger blocks will not be accepted as seen with the soft forks. As each soft limit (defined by signalling) is approached Miners can start signaling for a new softlimit as the old one melts away (the next one seems to have decent consensus at 2mb)
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:47:51
So when these Miners get unlimited power what stops users from forking away? 
It almost seems like Miners have an interest in serving users no matter what implementation they run. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:27:28
Obviously the price of Bitcoin would tank if users can't run a node.
Why would Miners purposesfully tank the price of Bitcoin when they are so heavily invested in the price? Especially when you consider theit track record of 8 years of responsibility increasing the blocksize as the soft limits were hit. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:44:45

@_date: 2017-03-30 02:54:10
Are you aware the Miners have forked blocksize many times in coordination before? It is insane to think that all of a sudden Miners lost this ability. BU is just a client that allows for forking beyond 1mb just like Bitcoin did from 0mb to 1mb.
The facts are when consensus is reached there will be a blocksize increase just like every time in the past. Just need to get through the politics of how. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:41:53
Bitcoin has soft forked the blocksize using EC from 0mb-1mb. BU is one hard fork to allow an infinite of soft forks to lower or raise the blocksize from 1mb to beyond. 
In the event Miners started producing mega blocks to drive away nodes then just like in the instance where Miners create more coins than allowed nodes would hard fork to a new pow. The incentives inherent to Bitcoin keeps Miners incentives aligned with users. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:07:20
I think if users were forced from the network *today* the price would drop significantly only because historically users could run nodes. 
Satoshi mentioned that Bitcoin eventually could be run on giant servers spread throughout the world. The censorship resistance is preserved because even if the US threatens/regulates US Miners and censors your tx, China, Russia, or some neutral miner will include it a block because it is in their best interest to do so ($). 
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:27:18

You can set the AD setting sufficiently high as to be practically infinite (in that you will die of old age before a block is accepted). The defaults have to be set to something. BU is the primary client for *easily* changes those values and Core does not let you set them at all. Definitely a huge difference in ideologies which is why the debate is so intense.

Not impossible. Many upgrades to the Bitcoin network have occurred when consensus was reached in the past. Signaling is the important ingredient in developing consensus which is why BU gives the option to signal blocksize as well. As more users and Miners adopt BU the network as a whole will have a much clearer picture of whether the network wants bigger or smaller blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:52:27
It has been invalidated in your eyes. No BU proponent would support a chain with more than 21 million Bitcoins no matter how much hash power is thrown at it which is what you are claiming.

So what if they aren't anymore. Nakamoto consensus is based on the assumption that an economic majority of hash rate is honest and that rules can be added or removed where 1 hash is 1 vote. If you don't believe Miners have a huge stake in the success of Bitcoin you are being deceived. The latest propaganda of nodes are the *real* economic majority won't convince anyone with even a basic understanding of Bitcoin let alone anyone who has read the white paper.

A miner runs a node to verify that other Miners are honest. This makes them a node just as much as a non miner. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:40:00
Bitcoin works as long as there is 1 honest node. In my example above even with 5 Super nodes it would still work because as long as 1 node is honest Bitcoins can't be created, stolen, or censored. This is the real security model of Bitcoin that is just orders of magnitude more secure when nodes are in the hundreds or thousands. 
I do agree that node costs should be kept low. But 1mb low is pure insanity.

BU allows for a blocksize increase. You are being obtuse. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 08:42:02
Implementing a gradual increase has the exact same hardforking risks as increasing the cap to 20mb. Also the 20mb cap (on average) won't even be hit for at least a year because it is more or less a *gradually* increasing metric. A year is also more than enough time to see how a 20mb cap affects the network.

Yes we agree that having 1 node securing the network is not useful but again that was a contrived example that shows that even with low decentralization Bitcoin still works as long as one honest node exists.
Rational miners **are** full nodes so by definition also fully validate so in my example Bitcoins properties hold true.

The impression I'm getting is your comment stems from TheDAO situation and that this is a negative for Ethereum. In reality, amateurs programming money is not an Ethereum issue so much as an issue with all programming especially when programming with money involved. A simple internet search will show banks are hacked all the time (and I doubt they hire 'amateurs').
The real question is: Does the market believe these issues are solvable?
Through a combination of standards, frameworks, and better learning material perhaps amateurs will someday be able to write safe financial dapps. In the mean time, there are still plenty of low hanging fruits for non-financial dapps that are perfect for an aspiring amateur to tackle.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:29:45
It is a blocksize increase but not a blocksize solution. Not too long after Segwit activates there will be yet another long-winded debate full of hate and vitriol on what the next blocksize will be. I for one would rather solve scaling now rather than put yet another bandaid on. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:48:40
Segregated witness as a soft fork only partially solves this behavior and calling it a complete fix is false because normal transactions can still be broadcast. One of the many reasons why people want segregated witness as a hardfork or another implementation.

Segwit just makes the incentives to attack greater since instead of 51 percent attack only being able to double spend it can now also spend Segwit funds. I honestly think this wouldn't happen but I haven't seen any papers on why it wouldn't.

Fair enough. In this case the software becomes readonly because it can't send a valid tx out. Either way a minority of user are forced to upgrade which have its pros and cons.

There are three options available: Segwit, a straight blocksize increase like Bitcoin classic or xt, and Bitcoin Unlimited which currently has around 10 percent of the network hash rate. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:44:03
To be fair, a 51 percent attack could steal funds today by allowing an invalid transaction into a block. The attack introduced by Segwit is similar except it produces a **valid** block. The theory goes that if a malicious miner starts to mine blocks without Segwit awareness and an example we'll say this miner is using Bitcoin core 0.12.1. If a miner or group of Miners reach 51 percent or higher (or lower if their goal is to disrupt/short the market) then there is this awkward situation where as far as 0.12.1 is concerned those are some juicy any one can spend outputs.

It doesn't fix malleability on original Bitcoin transactions, adds tech debt such as having to deal with 2 transaction types each with their own security issues. The backwards incompatible anyone can spend issue. The newly introduced centrally planned discount. But ya! Let's pretend that it's just a bunch of whiners who hate core. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 01:39:09
I don't think so. There is a pretty strong support for a hard fork over soft fork and extension blocks again would be unneeded complexity given the time frames people want. Soft forks also add an unknown amount of tech debt for any future developers. 
An interesting analogy is daylight savings time. While the idea is pretty simple, it has added many thousands of man hours in finding bugs and edge cases involved. With a soft fork the edge cases involve every work around needed to be used by the soft fork in order to make it backwards compatible. Combine that with every soft fork from the past and every soft fork into the future. 
Segregated witness and a direct blocksize increase as a hard fork is probably the farthest big blockers will compromise Imo. 
Consider this though. The longer the blocksize stalemate goes on the more solutions will be presented. I know flexible transactions while highly controversial will eventually by fine tuned and integrated into bitcoin unlimited. Now there are two implementations that solve the issues Segwit does. I'll be excited to see how the market reacts then.

- It is hard to trust a group of developers that let a community get split in two by not speaking out against the nefarious moderating practices that have gone on... 
- and many more if you actually bothered to understand both sides of the debate
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:14:16


You are right in that Bitcoin Unlimited assumes that market wants bigger blocks. Therefore BU enables a market based approach to picking a block size.
Segwit is a slight blocksize increase packaged with a whole bunch of controversial changes. r/btc wants a blocksize increase without the politics of segwit added.
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:30:25
There are alternatives to Segwit being developed. We'll have to wait and see how the market reacts as those possible solutions become ready.

No one worth their salt in the Ethereum ecosystem sees forking fast and often as a downside because they recognize the network is young. Unlike Bitcoin which should **not** fork fast and often but slowly and deliberately due to a more mature ecosystem and larger market cap.

Part of the reason I got into bitcoin was because of the idea of "banking the unbanked." At 24 cents a tx or even 10 cents a tx is too much for almost anyone in a third world country. Super awesome they can run a full node though to make sure rich people don't double spend.

Ask yourself if the following statements are true or false. 
- Since it's inception and until the fee market was developed, Bitcoin had an ever increasing blocksize completely determined by Miners. 
- Bitcoin becomes more efficient at using computational resources over time
- Computers become better in practically every metric over time
 If you consider any of the above is true makes absolutely no sense to have a stunted blocksize when the network can obviously handle more. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:41:50
Please provide any evidence backing  up your statement. 
If Miners start increasing blocksize so much so that nobody can validate, the price of Bitcoin will suffer and their profits go down and thus Miners will lower the blocksize in response to the market.
This is similar to how the price of Bitcoin suffers when a pool approaches a majority of network hash power thus decreasing the markets confidence in Bitcoin security.
If Bitcoiners can trust Miners to regulate hash power security then why can't they be trusted with blocksize security?
As an additional note. Nodes still have a voice regarding blocksize that cannot be ignored by Miners even if 100 percent of the network ran BU. If Miners want 2 mb blocks and 85 percent of the nonmining nodes wants 1mb blocks(like right now), Miners simply **will not** create a block greater than 1mb.
@_date: 2015-07-06 11:18:29

So would someone be less upset if the ransom was in dollars, ruples, or yuan? The answer is it doesn't matter really. The real issue is how little in todays world can be done in finding the **criminals** who commit these crimes.
I can easily imagine a database containing transactions of stolen or ransomed bitcoin. A public bounty will be awarded to anyone who can lead to the identity of the criminal. This can be an opt in system for business to use to help fight crime worldwide and can be as simple as running a "crime fighting" enabled wallet.

If attacking the network is profitable why did ghash not do it?
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:53:28
from wikipedia:


The ultimate result of a 51 percent attack is that innovators work towards a trustless zero comfirm solution. Ghash having 51 percent of the network had a tangible effect on the price of bitcoin and the market responded by moving to other pools. These examples fit my understanding of antifragility.
I'm not sure why you equate operating a gambling operation to low life scum because a single instance of that occurring...
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:32:33
So does that mean bitcoin is useless?  Or that 0 comfirms arent 100 percent secure? Someone convince me that a 51 percent attack will destroy the network because the only evidence so far supports the idea that 51 percent attacks can and do happen occasionally (once or twice?) but no one cares.

One could argue Bitcoin had a loose form of emergent consensus as the soft blocksize limits were each hit. BU and Classic both use the same form of consensus but with an important difference of requiring a hardfork. 
Now I am well aware of this subs stance on hardforks but it is also hard to ignore several other fairly successful alts that have scheduled hardforks and they are still doing fine.

If a company will make more money by allowing zero confirmations than if they don't will happily accept zero comfirmations.

BU is not a bigger train but actually more symbolic of opening more train stations and routes. This is because with cheaper txs more users can join (thus the need for more trainstations) and also cheaper txs mean more use cases open up (more routes between train stations). 
Luckily features included in Segwit can also be applied to the trains on BU tracks. Keep in mind BU trains are perfectly backwards compatible and Segwit trains are not.

Rogers views are hardly my own and as you and I know, the whitepaper is not the end all be all authority on Bitcoin. With that said, the whitepaper mentions that honest Miners work on the most recently found valid block. It is not inconceivable to see a scenario where a portion of honest hash power believes Bitcoin should evolve one way and another portion of honest hashrate believes Bitcoin should evolve a different way.
The real bitcoin (if you believe strongly in the whitepaper) is the chain with the most proof of work.
The chain with less proof if work is still run by honest Miners who believe in the long term evolution of their coin but is not the real Bitcoin as defined by the whitepaper.

To translate what I said into your format is...


It is not impossible to remove banks from the bitcoin process. There are so many options for getting bitcoin now that if a person wants bitcoins they can do so without using a bank. All I am saying is that if you want to introduce someone to bitcoin don't make them buy them themselves.

Bad customer service is unfortunately much easier to find than good customer service. In addition, traditional customer service is assumed to be mostly private so companies have slightly less incentive to give good customer service. Because of these issues many choose to opt out of a terrible experience and instead post to a public forum where the quality of customer is completely visible and therefore must be top notch if the company wishes to retain a good image. Not surprisingly people see good results with this method. 
We already see some companies realizing the power of open forums and so they created their own public forums for people to collaborate in solving issues as well as a cutting down on duplicate tickets. Crazy how user behaviors can change how companies operate!

Nodes declare a range of allowed blocksize. This is true of every Bitcoin implementation. 
Miners create blocks within the range allowed by nodes this is true of every Bitcoin implementation. 
Miners will not ever increase the blocksize unless they are sure an economic majority want it and the only way they can see that is by what nodes are signaling. This is working today! A super majority nodes are signaling 1 mb and a super majority of Miners are still mining 1 mb blocks. This is exactly how it works with BU with the exception is 1 mb is no longer a constant. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:35:05

Yah man. I spent 10 minutes on mobile to write my post because it was clearly explained in the article /s
How do big blockers take over the network even if everyone was running BU? They would have to fork away 93 percent of nodes who will always declare 1 mb as the only and smartest option.

@_date: 2016-10-24 07:13:19
The sybil attack you speak of is completely unrelated to BU though. If 95 percent of nodes were fake classic nodes and Miners were still on core, classic would never activate. Would the Miners suddenly start creating 2 mb blocks? No! Just like in my example above, Miners will still need to think for themselves if creating bigger blocks will hurt or harm the network. With BU they have an open (even if not perfectly symbol proof) way to measure market expectations (and don't pretend both sides of a fork can't run fake nodes). 
*Edit to add clarity 
@_date: 2016-10-25 04:58:31
If a super majority of nodes want to raise the blocksize then the Miners have to decide if raising the blocksize will hurt or harm the network and the price will follow their decision. If they chose wrong then either the Miners will lower the blocksize to start recovering their income or nodes will start lowering their max allowed blocksize to start recovering their investment. The market can solve the block size issue.

Your question is similar to asking if the internet has an official web browser.
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:50:14
Imagine a scenario where BU nodes were 100 percent of the network and 100 percent of nodes were signaling for up to 1 mb blocks and they will never accept a block over 1 mb. Over time blocks become more full. Some people were saying we need bigger blocks! These people have a ton of money and start trying to bribe miners to start creating bigger blocks. Miners can see that 100 percent of nodes will only accept 1 mb blocks but to try and persuade people they start signaling that they would like to produce up to 2 mb blocks. Around 4 percent of the nodes changed their signal to wanting 2 mb as well. Luckily, 96 percent of the network saw through the charade and held steady at 1 mb only. The people with all the money grow desperate and start to throw big (or small)  events to try and make big block signaling seem sexy. Now 7 percent of the network is signaling  for greater than 1 mb blocks! The Miners and nodes who want bigger block are frustrated. None of the network will change their signalling! 
My question is this... If BU leads to centralization where does my story above go wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:04:13
Miners also make sure that other Miners don't cheat. No users needed. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:46:06
An old style tx that is 1.01 mb will never ever fit into a supposed 2mb Segwit block. 
Is it still a blocksize increase or is it a blocksize increase*? 
*not actually 2mb blocks
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:23:45
I've never claimed the BU implementation or development team were perfect. The idea of BU is what I'm interested in. Luckily any dev with enough skill can improve the current BU code. 
Consensus rules I would support would look like this. If 95 percent of nodes signal for 2mb blocks and 950/1000 blocks (meaning 95 percent hash power) signal for 2 mb blocks then this would trigger a 1-2 month delay for the last 5 percent to upgrade their hardware to support 2 mb blocks. 
Edit: Luckily lightning network can facilitate the 5 percent who can't afford better hardware or giant TX fees.

@_date: 2015-03-13 08:10:38
Thank you for the clarification! I will study up a bit more and hopefully I explain it better next time. I find the possibilities brought by the lightning network fascinating. A neighborhood could create a "Neighborhood Bank" where the members of the community can provide liquidity (ie: normal people putting money into a "savings" account) to operate as a offchain payment network. Fees collected can then be given as interest to the liquidity providers, used as a community improvement fund, etc... Everything a modern bank does but no funds are ever at risk and people can finally earn real interest by putting their money in "savings" again except this time that money is being used for a real and useful purpose (liquidity/ not gambling in derivatives markets) .

@_date: 2016-10-24 17:00:17
In this case 93 percent are considered fake malicious nodes. Keep in mind that this is not a BU issue. How do the fake nodes get a miner to mine a 2 mb block. The real answer is they can't. The malicious actors either need to create new hash power to reach  95 percent of or convince existing Miners that the fake nodes are rational and get them to switch away from the existing software. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:42:39
So basically, neighborhoods can band together to create their own "Neighborhood Bank" where the neighborhood collectively uses it for their own daily needs. Those in the neighborhood who provide liquidity get reimbursed proportionally from fees collected by the payment network. All without endangering anyone's money or needing permission from the government.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:07:51
We can compare fees between bitcoin and any other payment network all we want, but at the end of the day, bitcoin is the only transparent, censor proof, and secure(cannot be confiscated or frozen by third parties) method for me to hold and send money. So even if fees are higher for bitcoin, it is still the only payment network that offers those services.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:02:09
You just described a miner orphaning their own blocks because... 
Users would not follow that chain.
Just give it a quick thought. If Miners create a network that Users cannot participate in, the value would go down! The Miners do not want worthless hardware. They've invested millions. Do you really think they would throw it away just to create unnecessarily large blocks?
If that question isn't enough, then why in the entire history of Bitcoin did the Miners not create unnecessarily large blocks If it gives them an advantage? 
Besides, xthin or compact blocks solves this issues, in addition a selfish miner who creates giant blocks with txs not in the mempool are *drastically* more likely to be orphaned. 
But wait! One more thing. All those users running nodes. How do the Miners convinces everyone to change a 1 to a 2?
BU doesn't give Miners access to the users nodes. They can't magically change the BU setting to infinity for every user in the network. 
So again, how do the Miners (specifically running BU) take control of the network? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:57:45

Bitcoin *cannot* do this and therefore my business will look elsewhere.

I really dont think this is the right idea behind the 21 bitcoin chip. 
Traditional miners convert electricity into bitcoins by buying expensive hardware and putting transactions into blocks for a fee. Well what if instead of buying expensive hardware you distributed tiny blockchain enabled hashing devices to everyone. The business model instead is you now accept no fee transaction (heyo micropayments!) and instead ask for say 10000 hashes per transaction. While your device is on it'll crank out those hashes thus completing the electricity to bitcoin conversion. They use the hashes to win the bitcoin lotto and everyone else enjoys free transactions.

Crazy innovations happen all the time. [Reversecoin]( claims to be able to do exactly that. In addition, I have no doubt that bitcoin will be able to do the same thing but better using smart contracts.


Wallet software gets better every year. NFC and bluetooth payments are becoming easier to use especially with the latest smart phones. Web wallets continue to become more sophisticated as well. In addition, [BIP70]( is a very good start for seemless and sensible transactions.


This statistic is a little odd. Is 1 in 16 bitcoins stolen annually? Even so, credit cards have around [~10 billion dollars in fraud annually]( Going by the 1:16 ratio, bitcoin could have a market cap of 160 billion to match the fraud in credit cards. I suspect that as hardware wallets become more prevalent and more security talent moves to the bitcoin space this will go down orders of magnitude.


Confirmation times are already ridiculously quick in several other cryptos. [Nubits]( has ~30s average comfirmation time as well as a stable peg to remove volatility issues. As for bitcoin, [instant secure payments]( are coming as well as [other security features]( that can be implemented as well.

He doesn't have a valid argument. For instance, developers of the lightning network openly admit we will need a hardfork to increase the base blocksize to much higher than the 2mb hardfork proponents have been asking for. Bitcoin will eventually need to fork to become quantum proof, and also hardforks are a valid upgrade mechanism for many of the top 100 successful coins. 
If this isn't enough arguments for a hardfork remember that Bitcoin has hard forked in the past.

The ability to fire up a node was **not** an original requirement for users. Satoshi even talks about datacenters handling the bulk of the load. 
I'm not saying Bitcoin *should* only be run in datacenters but I also don't think someone making 10 dollars a day will **ever** run a node no matter what. Their money is better spent elsewhere. Bitcoin has solutions built in to be usable even for the poorest people at any size block.

Using dogecoin as an on ramp to crypto is still a tremendous boost to the entire network. This is simply undeniable. The fact is that as long as there are people who want to jump into crypto, dogecoin will have value. This reason alone means dogecoin will never truly be worth zero until adoption is 100% (yay!). For most people dogecoin will lead them to other wonderful cryptos like bitcoin, peercoin, counterparty, nubits, and all these other wonderful evolutions. Bitcoin cannot fill all those voids (at least not yet). I'm not sure why people think it's a bad thing. I know all this because I am an average joe. This was me December 2013. I was brought to the Dogecoin subreddit by clicking on the random subreddit button. I was sucked in by how helpful and nice people were. Now I have most my wealth safely stored in bitcoin and a healthy investment in other crazy cryptocoin adventures.

I'm not sure I believe that having more money makes someone a more "serious" investor. For someone with little money to say "I believe in your company and want to invest" is in some ways more serious because it is a greater total percent of their net worth. I understand the reasons behind having a minimum but I don't have to like them.

There is huge demand for banking in 3rd world countries yet we repeatedly see banks not fulfill this need in any currency. Again, many people don't have the privilege of having a US bank account or the ability to send money anywhere in the world.

Block weight is a hack to make the blocksize increase backwards compatible.
Segwit tx fees have a centrally planned discount of 75 percent set by Core developers due to the fact the witness data can be pruned. Pruning the witness data happens to be a security drawback so it remains to be seen if Miners will use this discount or not due to this reason.

The current style of creating a transaction will take 4 bytes of block weight for every 1 byte of the transaction data if Segwit is activated. 
A Segwit style tx uses 1 byte of block weight for every 1 byte of tx data. 
Keep in mind there are security tradeoffs between the two types of transactions.

While I agree that if r/bitcoin were completely full of people like u/americanpegasus that it indeed would be a cult. The fact the you are a member of r/bitcoin, so are critics like r/buttcoin, as well as the silent majority of people with a wide range of opinions and knowledge means you are correct! Bitcoin is not a cult. Bitcoin is a **community**.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:17:01
I agree that mining centralization may be an issue in the future but I highly doubt miners will ever become bad actors. The upfront cost to have enough hashing power to attack the network is enormous. Not to mention the electricity needed to keep it running. If a miner then decided to attack the network it would cause predictable dump on the market. So now this miner can't pay their bills and have millions of dollars in useless hardware. As an upside, this may force a hardfork to a different proof of work algo. 
A more likely scenario would be the top pools being hacked and then used to attack the network.
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:33:27
I'm not speaking about Shapeshift in particular just in general anything even incrementally better than the existing paradigm is shit on for not being full blown decentralized. 
If Ethereum didn't fork it would have destroyed itself. Years of txs just fighting for the funds that everyone and their mother knows did not belong to the hacker. If you spout code is law then I'll fire back with users are running code (that is supposedly law) that says the hack was illegitimate... So again where is the issue?

The block reward is a necessary bootstrap to pay miners to secure the network. At least until transaction fees make up a greater portion of the reward (after another 1 or 2 halvings hopefully). Anyone who did their due diligence knows about the block reward and understands why it is important. Anyone who disagrees with it should make their own decision to invest or not.

Unless the bank is dealing with physical cash (doubtful) it costs them almost nothing to store that money and the therefore the cost to the consumer should be proportionate. 
I may be wrong but it sounds like the banks are saying, "We would have used your money to make us money but now we can't do that so instead we will just take your money."

Derivatives actaully do have an important use. For instance farmers can "lock in" the future cost of their crop allowing them to remove volatility from their finances. In order for this to work there must be someone who believes those goods will be worth more in the future(gambling) or trying to hedge. Another example would be an ice cream company may want to lock in the future price they pay for milk to insure they can afford it in the event milk prices go up.

You misunderstand a couple concepts that make bitcoin work. The block reward is the **SOLUTION** to the 51 percent attack. By having the block reward a single miner with 51 percent of the network will make more money by simply mining. The specifics of why that is are rooted in game theory. 
Also, what you call an overbloated mining network, I call the most secure decentralized payment network in the world. More hashpower will always further secure the network because it increases the hashpower needed for an attack on the network.

@_date: 2015-02-24 18:40:22
I understand the point you are trying to make but I feel like you overlook a few important points.
Bitcoin (imo) is a global currency which is different than a national currency like the Ruble. This distinction will hopefully become more pronounced with adoption but adoption won't happen on its own. I wouldn't expect a daycare to accept Rubles because I don't live in russia. What's cool about bitcoin is if someone from any country goes to any other country they could pay with bitcoin to any business that accepts it. The only currency I know that comes close to being able to do that is the US dollar. 
Anyway, I up voted you for asking a good question.

Gold has a history that makes Bitcoins first mover advantage look like a joke. 
The point I am trying to make is that gold is not future proof. Eventually someone will pull an asteroid to earth that flatlines the entire metal industry. But cryptocurrencies are future proof in that an alien can't show up on Earth with a Bitcoin fortune and flatline the Bitcoin market. 
I'm also not claiming to know the timelines for these things just that gold will eventually not be used as a store of value. I think younger generations feel the same way but for other reasons. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:04:43
I may be wrong, but I remember reading that the network can reject blocks based on IP address. This obviously has other issues and there are probably other ways good actors can punish bad actors. Switching to a new algo is like a giant reset button. It would stop the bad actor but also cripple good actors as well.

False. They are both decentralized autonomous organizations. 
An important note many disregard is that Decentralization is a gradient. Not only that but cryptos aren't locked into any one location on the scale. Some get better over time and some get worse. People betting on Ethereum probably believe the former.
