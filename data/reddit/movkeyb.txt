Your thoughts on the interest rate are literally irrelevant. The discussion is about bitcoin. You try to obfuscate your stupidity and lack of knowledge by changing the topic, but that topic you also have no knowledge on. 
If you want to have a real discussion (and not a circular one in your fantasy land where you think you can throw out random acronyms and expect to have them refuted), why not respond to my post. 
Don't expect me to waste my time talking to the equivalent of a markov bot, because your posts make about as much sense as one.

You have nothing you can teach me, because you have no education yourself. You have shown that fact over and over again. You don't even have an education worthy of a 100 level class, let alone somebody who has actually studied economics. You confuse the ability to google acronyms and bring up tangential examples with actual competence.

You're an idiot. You know the fed has other tools right? Tools you would know about if you took an economics class.
Take freshman ECON and write back why don't you.

Not addressing the stupidity of the first point (for which is usually missed by 1%, not by -2002%), you are aware that 1) gold is not considered a currency and that 2) gold took over 70 years to reach the "price correction", right?

There's a limited supply of a lot of things. For example team fortress earbuds. They used to be worth $50 each, now they're worth just slightly more than $2.50. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:09
Because you have zero clue about basic economics.
Take team fortress earbuds. They are arguably similar to bitcoin. They're electronic 'money', with near zero practical value, but was traded anyway among players, and at one point had a value of $50. 
People foolishly believed, like you do now, that their limited supply would guarantee value.
They were wrong. As you are now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:27:55
I'm saying unpredictability makes it fail as a store of value. 
Comparing it to precious metals is a weird argument, considering that  gold rose by 8% (which is average, target for *investments* is 7%)
Bitcoin rose by 2,000%. 
Does that sound like stability? 
Tell me, do you know why countries have inflation targets? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:20:54


Say tomorrow, a solar flare hits the USA, knocks out the entire power grid, and literally lights every single electronic device on fire, rendering bitcoin useless. What then, statists? 
The fed controls the money supply through various measures. They have tools to do that. Tools you obviously don't understand because you've never taken any economics courses.

You try to talk like an academic, but you obviously confuse "difficult to read precision" in academic writing with "difficult to read prose" in teen fanfiction.

Are you stupid? 
Gold rose to 800 in 2007. The last time gold costed $35 was in 1939. 
Bitcoin rose by 2,000 percent in one year. It took over 65 times as long for gold to do the same. 
Additionally, I'd like for you to try to buy a coffee with some gold and let me know how that goes. And no, overpaying them wouldn't count. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:07:24
Yes? The arguments against bitcoin are fundamental. 
It fundamentally is not currency. Anybody who redefines what "currency" is is not from a real school of Economics. It doesn't store value (hyperdeflation), it cannot act as a medium of transaction(also hyperdeflation, instability, huge transaction costs, extremely long delays), and a Standard of value (although this people argue, as bitcoin can be evenly split, so I'll give this one a pass)
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:31:58
I've never heard of somebody defining a discussion where they cover their ears and shout "na na can't hear you" as anything but childish, let alone "respectful" and "professional".

@_date: 2017-12-11 17:32:47
Before you feel special, I wrote this for a class. It's part of a much larger paper. 
For starters, Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility makes it useless as a store of value or as a standard of deferred payment. Bitcoin’s volatility risk (its tendency to change rapidly and unpredictably) is 7 times higher than gold, 8 times higher than the stock market, and 18 times greater than USD (Williams, 5). Its price is often random and unpredictable, and its sudden price peaks and drops force markets that use Bitcoin as their medium of exchange not to list their prices in Bitcoin itself, but to price with USD to keep pricing consistent, as often Bitcoin can have price shifts of over 20% in mere hours. 
	Additionally, Bitcoin’s non reversibility makes it fail as a medium of transaction. While cash has to be stolen in person and credit card fraud is covered by the company and can be charged back, Bitcoin has neither protection. It has the convenience of letting thieves steal information from a distance, and the finality and anonymity of cash (that is to say, the name of people completing cash transactions are not recorded automatically like with credit cards). 
This causes Bitcoin theft to be extremely prevalent, with sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars being stolen at once (Takemoto and Knight, 2017), and once they are stolen, there is nothing for the victim to do. Bitcoin’s setup as being fully anonymous implicitly encourages thieves, offering them full protection against any recourse by keeping them anonymous, and guaranteeing them to be able to keep their stolen wares by not having a reversal mechanism. Money laundering through Bitcoin is simple, as Bitcoin wallets (where people store their bitcoins) are tied to numbers, not to people, thus a wallet could be assigned to anybody. Bitcoin’s vulnerability to theft requires users of Bitcoin to use arcane and confusing systems, often having to be stored in an Air Gap (A computer that is fully disconnected from the internet), mitigating any of the convenience of Bitcoin. As Berkeley Professor Nicholas Weaver puts it, “Let's pause for a moment to reflect... What sort of online currency requires using offline computers and objects for all storage?”
	At any rate, Bitcoin is not a good store of value because it does not have a reason for value. Gold for example has value because of its practical purposes. It is attractive, and usable not only as jewelry, but for dentistry and for electronics. Gold’s value is very unlikely to zero because it will have practical value. On the other hand, while United States Dollars (USD) does not have a practical purpose, it is guaranteed by the federal government to always be valuable. It has a strong backing system that keeps faith in its system, and by law USD has to be accepted to pay government obligations and private debt. 
	However Bitcoin has neither legitimate use nor legitimate backing. Bitcoins do not exist. They do not have material existence, nor do they have “even the virtual existence of MP3 or video files” (par. 2). They have no use outside of currency. Unlike USD, they are not guaranteed as currency either. No government backs Bitcoin, in fact it is quite the opposite, Bitcoin touts itself as being controlled by nobody. There is no legal guarantee for Bitcoin to be usable, thus making Bitcoin inherently useless.
This is non-existence is comparable in theory to money in a bank account. The client cannot see the money they might have in their account, and the money may not physically exist, and if it is transferred to another bank account, no physical money would change hands, just the ledgers for each person would be modified, similar to a Bitcoin transaction. In his letter to the SEC, Professor Jorge explains the difference between a Bitcoin ledger and a bank ledger:
	A bank is bound by contract and by law to transfer the amount stated in that 
ledger to other banks, or to cash, if the client requests it; and the government is morally obliged to preserve the purchase value of that cash, to a reasonable degree. But there are no legal, contractual, or moral obligations about Bitcoin transfer or conversion to other money instruments; and there is no entity tasked with preserving its value. (par. 5)
	Bitcoin is therefore more comparable to a Ponzi scheme, or to penny stocks. They are assets of a system without value. Bitcoin does not have any assets, any products, any staff, or provide any services, it does not have a backing entity, or any financial review board. Its value comes solely from speculation, “based on expectations of traders about future prices, which will be based on expectations of future expectations…” (par. 10)

Bitcoin is one of the few topics to unify every legitimate school of thought, and all of them are against it.

You obviously don't understand the fed, even though you're using their acronyms. I'd bet you literally looked up their actions just so you could use their acronyms. 
Also fake news, they do QT all the time. What do you think increasing the interest rate is? 
That's QT. You've literally never taken a single econ class in your life, have you?

Bitcoin does not act in the fashion that they write about. Even though people advocate for fixed money supplies, they reject bitcoin for its numerous other problems as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:45:56
Anything /can/ be used as a medium of exchange if two parties will it to be. 
Doesn't mean that it's a good one.
Bitcoin fails in how it can't be used for transactions. That's why steam dropped bitcoin support.

I use the word "legitimate" because I don't count clown colleges as harboring schools of thought. No respected university holds views which would make bitcoin a currency.

Fallacy fallacy : )
There is nothing I can say. You literally lack even a rudimentary level of economics so trying to explain them to you is literally worse than explaining to a high schooler, because you're an adult, presumably. Or you are *literally* a child, which wouldn't surprise me that much.
You abuse words and acronyms without knowing what they are or what they mean, contradict yourself, confuse concepts, blatantly misapply terms, and then ignore what's actually written. 
You want to actually discuss something related to economics? Try reading the page that I copied here from the paper. If you can actually figure that out (which would be rather impressive given your track record) I'll post you the other 10 pages.
Then maybe we can try having a discussion. Or, you can continue to ignore all the legitimate points, and then cry about how I don't make any, because your feeble mind literally turns itself off when it is contradicted. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:36:02
Bitcoin is, by and large, not used to sell goods. Which is why people keep holding onto it. 
There is a very limited supply of a lot of things. Limited supply does not make something valuable. 
Have you taken any economics classes? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:20:20
Because a store of value is consistency. Hyperdeflation is volatility, which is rather the opposite, as the word "hyper" implies. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:41:15

You'd be lucky if the guy locating the guy, if he even is in the US, and getting him to show up to court, and even if you can win against all that, then you have to find where his money is, and then try to get any money.

I guess I did. I don't think that will happen, but I don't really want to have that argument. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:42:49


I just checked your post history. I don't think there's any point in actually trying to have a discussion with you.
Because I think that laymen showing up in r/debate to tell us how competitive debate works is bad? 


oops, my bad, meant to type "op"


I'm aware. As you've read my comments, you no doubt know that I consider online debates a waste of time.


My whole point is that my comments are correct in the context of the discussion. You come in, and are like "but don't you see, in a completely different context, you are wrong". 
I'll remind you that this conversation started because I told op that proselytizing to laymen is a bad idea because bitcoin can offer nothing to them. You come in, say "here's 5 benefits to people in the 3rd world, therefore, you're wrong". Do you not see the fundamental disconnect? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:07:58
This makes even less sense then. Opp isn't selling a technology, he's selling an investment. Unless he's proposing that 1) dollarization will stop happening (which is already pretty unlikely) and 2) that bitcoin is going to replace it (which is literally impossible), then why would somebody ever want to start using bitcoin and stop using dollars? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:28:54
Unless op is having casual conversations with the global poor, I don't think this is a relevant concern. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:18:22




Considering thats what the thread is about, thats the context that matters. If OP is being unclear, thats on him for not being clear, not on me. The only point that I'm making is that OP trying to proselytize on laymen with an obviously prewritten speech that ignores very basic concerns is a dumb idea. Everything you mentioned either has super obvious counter-concerns or is such a fringe issue that I don't think its particularly relevant for laymen. 


if you're concerned about voilitity, its pretty obvious that bitcoin's price stability is many times lower than that of the dollar. 


This is a fringe concern, also cash doesn't have that issue (obviously)


Bitcoin transactions can not be reversed. It is therefore safe against fraudulent chargebacks.
Most people aren't sellers, but buyers, and I think the concerns of "i can't do a chargeback" is far higher on most peoples minds than "somebody might chargeback against me"


Also nonunique with cash
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:55:03
I see. So now you're going to convince laymen to trade bitcoin because you think that the dollar is going to collapse. I think this strategy will almost certainly make you seem insane, but your call. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 23:20:27
that doesn't solve for any of the 4 failure points 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:29:00
But your whole plan is so dumb and makes bitcoin look super silly.
You're basically telling people "the US economy is going to collapse because we went off the gold standard, which means that all traditional investments will also become worthless, and the only investment that won't be effected by this will be Bitcoin"
This literally has so many problems that nobody with half a brain will take you seriously. 
All somebody has to believe is 
1) that the removal of the gold standard will not cause the economy to permanently collapse
OR 
2) that a US economy collapse will not permanently effect traditional investments like stocks / real estate
OR 
3) that bitcoin will also be effected by this crash 
OR 
4) that bitcoin will not become the new standard
and then they will think your idea is dumb. You have FOUR failure points, and just ONE of those points being bought into makes you look like a lunatic. 
What a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:05:37


but when they say is 'its so inconvenient' or 'what if i get hacked' what is your responese? 
you doing this literally is only going to confirm the preconceptions that people have because you're only going to suggest inconvenient workarounds and the only benefit that you have is "oh you'll get rich" which, if you're wrong, is going to make literally everybody hate you .
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:56:18


That wasn't my intention, but I'll admit that I could have made it more clear that I was intending my question on what the comparative bitcoin is if not to credit cards to be in reference to usage for laymen. 


You're also strawmanning my argument slightly by phrasing it as "5 benefits to people in the 3rd world". I don't appreciate that.
Considering that your only response was that I lived in a western liberal democracy and that they're legitimate problems in the 3rd world, I don't think its an inaccurate summation.
