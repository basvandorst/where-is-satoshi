Sounds very similar to how people respond to the “different delivery” mechanisms that blockchain tech enables.

Which is why I included this. Not exactly sure how that would play out. Not sure how the mempool is affected or if less transactions would be processed. If the hypothetical were to happen, I’d imagine a 51% attack would be far easier to accomplish. Among other vulnerabilities, but I can’t say for certain.

My buddy left a wallet at their friend’s house, was having car trouble, and needed a part right then in order to drive.
I took him to the store, paid for his parts using a card, and **asked him to pay me back in cash** specifically so there’s no transaction data out there on our personal situation here.
I really don’t care that much (as I tell this story on the interwebs) about the triangulation here - we did nothing illegal. They didn’t have their wallet, I covered the part, they’re paying me back. My point is that there is **zero trace of this transaction** taking place online **if we do it in cash** and don’t say a word about it.
Just because we don’t have money laundering data on cash, doesn’t mean it’s not the most powerful way to hide wealth/dealings. 
Had we used Bitcoin, there would have been all kinds of data created/collected when they signed up to buy it for the first time in order to pay me.

Take a look at how the Bolivar has performed vs the Dollar over the past year: 
It’s interesting to look at national currencies like the Bolivar, and compare them to Bitcoin - which will remain more stable over time? Which will retain more value?
Fun time. :)

Here you are, friend. There are many other videos showing the short couple minutes on “eCash,” but here’s the long version so you can skip through it to find what you need - maybe there’s more fuel for you in there:

The fact that the network *can* stay alive with one computer running it doesn’t necessarily mean only one miner would be alive after a hypothetical government crackdown. 
One miner mining the Bitcoin network is more of a world war/apocalyptic scenario type thing...let’s be real, a “government crackdown” would *probably* not result in one bitcoin miner standing.
Bitcoin is not limited to one particular nation. Even if multiple country governments collude to outlaw mining and use of Bitcoin, there are plenty places in the world that will still be doing it. Not to mention all of the people who would setup individual miners. 
How exactly would these governments actually prevent every individual that wants to get away with mining Bitcoin?
The example of one computer mining/securing the network was an absolute worst case scenario that I’m not sure has a high probability of happening anytime soon.

Yes, “hodl” is a crypto community thing. Shirt is spelt correctly.

If the government, somehow, successfully shutdown all of the major mining farms across the globe, us plebians would start mining on our personal computers.
I would imagine more small mining pools would emerge and more people would be incentivized to mine. This would end up adding more security to the network in place of the major mining farms that hypothetically got shutdown. This would keep the network alive and running.
I don’t know the technical side of how this would all happen and what types of vulnerabilities the network might be exposed to if the hypothetical were to happen, but the tech is designed to be resistant. 
My understanding is that, so long as at least 1 computer somewhere is mining, the network should persist and transactions will continue to be processed.
