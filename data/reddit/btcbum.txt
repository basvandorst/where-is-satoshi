I would be very careful not to assume that, and clarify the situation before investing in this.
The risk is that they do not own the underlying asset, and cannot cover a rapid increase in the value of BTC. A lot of financial 'innovation' works like this . . . underpricing risk and then insisting 'no-one could have seen THAT coming!' when it all goes wrong.

I agree. I can understand that not everyone cares for his OTT style, but it has always been clear to me that he is man of some considerable intellect. He uses a lot of high-falutin language - typically that's a sign of covering up an intellectual deficiency - but not in Brand's case. It's a higher form of expression that doesn't seek to obscure but rather to reveal.

I'd guess he made an early bad call on Bitcoin, and needs Bitcoin to fail to confirm his self-image of a smart person. A lot of bullshit comes down to boring ego-defense stuff.
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:48:18
No, if you made an early good call on Bitcoin, you've already made a good call at 100-1 or 1000-1 odds.
If you made an early bad call on Bitcoin (see the early quora top post on bitcoin for a laugh), you can either now admit you were wrong, or hope for the whole thing to fail catastrophically and claim to have been right all along.

Actually, using a brain wallet is one of the ways to avoid broken RNGs - it is deterministic and I started using deterministic wallets after the revelations that the NSA had compromised RNGs. 
Note that brainwallet also allows you to sign transactions - this may use broken randomness, so it might be that generating transactions with it also leaves you vulnerable.

No. Don't be that guy.
When you get an invoice or bill reminder by e-mail, or you want to buy something on-line, a polite 'Do you accept Bitcoin yet?' is effective. Don't forget the 'yet'. As of 2014, it's a fair question for internet retailers and service providers and will speed adoption.

Exactly right. People have difficult understanding money because they have difficulty in valuing ideas that create a public good. What's the value of democracy, or a culture of reciprocity or respect for teachers? Compound that with the habit we have of valuing all things in terms of money.
So try to value the idea of a new form of money in terms of money. Difficult to get your head around certainly. You could forgive someone the error, but you wouldn't give them much respect as an economist.

Odesk recently e-mailed me to let me know that they'd henceforth be billing me in my local currency. For my convenience. 
Whenever I see that phrase, "For your convenience", I know I'm getting shafted. In this case I assume it's by charging me an unfavourable exchange rate - a 3% hit is standard in these cases. (Somewhere they have a PHB thinking . . . . hey our customers are being ripped off by their credit card companies forex rates . . . wouldn't it be better if we ripped them off instead! For their convenience! I'm a genius, I deserve a bonus this quarter!)
So here's a reason why some companies are going to prefer credit cards for cross-currency transactions, it gives them an opportunity for a sneaky 3%. I haven't worked out the AirBnb wheeze on this yet . . something to do with rounding up I think. For my convenience I'm sure.
These companies usually start off pretty decent and honest, but within a few years they're often pulling this sort of crooked crap.

Looks to me like you've got to sell your BTC at a 9% discount (current rates). Not clear if there is any additional fee, or what the maximum amount is. Presumably 7-11 doesn't want to have too much cash readily available in every store. Thai resident ID required.
Still, it is progress. Would like to see that 9% come down - maybe it will with increased usage.

The question Krugman answered was 'what if a nation adopted Bitcoin as its national currency?' and concluded that was a very bad idea. Maybe Krugman was right about that, and maybe he is the best man to answer that question.
However, it was the wrong question . . That's why the article was facile. He wanted to be talking about the gold standard.
The interesting question is 'what is the effect of having a complementary currency with these easy transferability and storage properties?'
Now I wonder if Krugman is up to the task of answering that more interesting question.

Last time, a lot of people were insisting it was a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. Its embarrasing to lose on an investment, but especially on a ponzi. But ponzis don't bounce, so that's the real difference - you might still lose your whole investment, but it's more like any risk now. You know you're taking a risk rather than being taken for a ride.

The solution is for average Joe to never own Bitcoin. When he wants to pay for something in Bitcoin, he logs onto his online bank, where his balance is in FDIC insured dollars. He enters the amount and address, and his bank converts the funds into Bitcoin and sends.

Btc is a lot more liquid than gold. Because of the nature of btc. 20 percent of the world supply of btc can show up on mtgox a lot faster than 20 percent of the world gold supply. 
Gold also has value as jewellery . . . Now I'd argue that value is there because gold has value . . . But it gives it a kind of inertia . . My gold chain still impresses in much the same way, even if gold dropped 25 percent the previous day.
Gold is the closest comparator but they are way different. Btc is a new class of instrument.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:24:59
No. You missed the point. Gold is deflationary, but it doesn't cause a problem because we don't price things in gold. We won't be pricing things in BTC either. 
The deflationary problem only exists if we transfer a nation's monetary system onto the 'Bitcoin-Standard'. We won't be doing that, so it is irrelavent. 
Don't feel bad though, Krugman made the same mistake and he's well regarded in some quarters.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:08:53
Thanks for the clarification. Sounds like it doesn't do anything that you couldn't do on a web site. I prefer to use a browser for accessing an online wallet.

Just as there is a difference between gold and the gold standard, there is a difference between Bitcoin and a 'Bitcoin standard'. This is why so many old school economists sound foolish - they understand a Bitcoin standard would be distrastrous, which they are qualified to comment on, but write off Bitcoin in its entirety, which is too wide a conclusion.

Why do you think price swings will dwindle? I keep seeing this stated, but no explanation as to why. I think the best we could hope for would be a volatility similar to gold, but I doubt we'd even get that. Volatility is here to stay and no-one will ever price their goods in BTC.

The main value of gold is now historical convention.
The reason gold became so valued was that it had properties that made it ideal to use as money and currency. Its value is related to the possibility in the future, in changed conditions, it may again be ideal to use as money. It's a pessimistic investment.
Bitcoin has properties that make it ideal for using as money in certain situations. I don't know if you'd call that intrinsic value, but that's where its value comes from. I'd say its optimistic.
The people who truly understand and believe in Bitcoin are fundamentally optimistic.

I wonder if it might be uniquely susceptible to market panics though. Its value is solely derived from its value as a medium of exchange. The higher it goes, the better it fulfills this purpose, and so the higher it goes. But every so often, everyone will 'come to their senses' and panic, collapsing the price.

The reason economists don't have useful things to say about Bitcoin is usually not because they are wise and experienced, but because they don't understand it, or they don't understand the assumptions the theories they use are based on.
There are risks, problems, uncertainties and justified doubts about Bitcoin. But if your economist mentions deflation, you've got a moron on your hands.

So even if it got to the price stability of something like silver . . . Would that change anything? I don't think so . . Still too volatile to use for prices or contracts.

Liquidity. Bitcoin is only valuable if it can be used for trade. In order for it to be used for trade, traders need to know the value of it, and be able to move into and out of it quickly. The exchanges had major problems, and bitcoin couldn't be effectively used for trade, causing a loss of confidence in its usefulness. Confidence hasn't returned yet, although I think it is just a teething problem.
There are problems that could transpire that would make me lose confidence . . such as a concerted government crackdown, or a fundamental problem with the encryption was discovered . . . but this ain't that sort of problem.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:09:04
The volatility doesn't matter . . . but the liquidity is a killer.
People need to know what the price is, and be able to transfer in and out of bitcoin to be able to trade items for it. I imagine even Silk Road is closed during this debacle . . . what exchange rate could they use?
We don't need a stable btc price (and we're not going to get one). But we do need rock solid exchanges.

The price is a prediction of usage. High price = prediction of high use.

Yeah, it's not really a currency. Most people don't understand that yet. It is revolutionary though, and it's going to touch every area of Internet commerce. For starters.

Hoarding implies a negative action . . . But Bitcoin speculators help Bitcoin by increasing its value and liquidity. Call it stockpiling or saving if you must, but 'hoarding' makes it sound grubby.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:00:19
Yeah. On android the capcha doesn't work, so can't open an account, the transaction fee is hard coded in Bitcoin and is currently north of a dollar, and when you click cancel, it sends the transaction anyway with no fee at all.
And it's probably the best android client. 
There is work to be done here.

You're right, they would peg to local currencies. However it would make the price gouging more obvious if we were in different currency zones, but compared the btc we paid.

A brand new asset class would certainly be a valuable part of a diversified portfolio.

No. Currencies serve a number of purposes. I think what will emerge is that btc is a very good currency for transferring or exchanging value, and a very poor unit of account or store of value.
In the coming years, things will still be priced in national currencies, but increasingly transfers will be made with btc. You'll either Accept the volatility and store your own btc. Or you'll have an account in dollars that offers immediate convertibility to and from btc when you make and receive payments.

It's not so ridiculous. They abhor the gold standard, and call gold a barbarous relic . . . But keep a fuckton of it in the vaults, and won't return it to the Germans  . . . Well not for 7 years or so . . That's how long it takes to put it on a ship.

Time we should start specifying the transaction fee in USD - say 1 cent - and calculate the btc value at time of transaction.
Nothing will ever be priced in BTC, the transaction fee should follow.

On first glance it seems Krugman isn't any different to other economists. But if you look closely, you'll see his beard is a slightly different colour.
