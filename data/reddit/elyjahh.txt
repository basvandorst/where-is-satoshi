What do you even mean ? I told him that if they ask for more than just the last 4 digits it is a problem. He has the card literally in his hand when he makes the purchase, the last 4 digits if they ask for it its ok because the platform needs it just to confirm the card.
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:49:45
Its old but still fancy so why not, you pay more for something you can not find so easily as before.

=))) nice one man
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:09:28
Try localbitcoins or paxful for low amounts. And what kind of info they want from the credit card ? If it is just your name and maybe the last 4 digits its ok. If they want the whole credit card it might be a problem so watch out.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:43:47
You have lots of other options to chose from, google for coinmamma bitstamp bitpanda gemini, even [bitcanuck.ca]( (only for Canadians) or [cryptocoin.pro]( (only EU)
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:42:03
All I can recommend is a platform that uses only interac or wire transfer if you wish to switch but its only for canadian citizens. google for [bitcanuck.ca](  its very user friendly and with a nice support team.
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:59:32
Hmm, if you want nice live support you should google for [cryptocoin.pro]( They also have lots of coins to chose from.
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:57:51
Hello, you can google for [bitcanuck.ca]( Its only for Canadian citizens. The downside is that they only accept interac transfers or wire transfer. Plenty of coins and nice live support team.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:12:18
Hello, you should add [bitcanuck.ca]( also, its still pretty small but available only to canadian citizens.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:57:47
I would not recommend coinbase, you could try coinmama, bitstamp, bitpanda and see how it goes.
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:00:30
If you are from Canada you could try [bitcanuck.ca]( Its only available for canadian citizens. Only problem is that you can only buy with interac transfer or wire transfer. After you buy you only need to withdraw the coins to your hardware wallet (nano ledgers s)
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:17:24
It is very possible to be the sharing account thing the problem or also maybe your bank simply does not allow transactions with crypto, in which case you need a new bank account. You could try until then to use paxful or localbitcoins and pay with paypal/creditcard/bank transfer/etc; but be very careful there, only buy from reputable vendors.

You live on Mars or what ? stop the bullshit please

"ECB believes the bitcoin market needs to mature for the institution to consider regulating it." I think this is very important and makes perfect sense.

omg what is happening in your notification bar, its like a war there, every app fights to be seen.
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:21:29
Pretty good idea, would be awesome to add a function that tells you the fee for a custom time set (3h:25min:30sec for ex). Keep up the good work !
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:09:37
You can always change your platform, go to coinmama, bitstamp, bitpanda, etc if you are not happy with what coinbase offers. Or if you are from Canada I recommend googling [bitcanuck.ca]( , the platform is very user friendly.
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:53:02
Yeah, it is a little bit strange in USA, the "regulation" is by state...so if you have a trading platform you may sell only in the states you have license from, pretty ugly from my pov. Try paxful / localbitcoins, bitpanda, bitstamp, you still have plenty to chose from, depends where you are located at the moment of buying, for Canada you can go for [bitcanuck.ca]( or Eu, for [cryptocoin.pro]( 
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:22:36
Strong security, privacy, easy to transfer anywhere in the world, the fact that real electrical energy was used to create them, the power of demand and supply, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:11:57
As much as I am happy about that because it boosts cryptocurrencies forward it's pretty sad people still trust banks with their money. We still need a lot of time before we can make the change to crypto, the banks are still needed and will be for a long time.
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:54:17
If you do not need those money, do not dare to sell it now, have a little bit of faith and hodl! I guarantee you will be happy later this year.
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:06:40
Last time this happened to me I directly contacted their support to remove the auth from my account so I could add it from my new phone, you could try it but it just depends on what exchange you are using and how fast their support is.
@_date: 2018-10-04 08:21:18
It is strange that people need so many guides and explanations to buy coins with credit cards since they have been buying things only with cc for a long time now. The only thing that differs is the verification process (KYC) from some platforms, other than that, you just need to know a little bit about what you are buying. The article has some good sites, but you could add paxful or localbitcoins, where you can buy from real people, the only downside is that you need to make sure the vendor is a legit person otherwise the coins may be flagged. If you want to avoid that, search for more licensed platform like [bitcanuck.ca]( (just for canada) / bitstamp (also USA) or [cryptocoin.pro]( (just EU).
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:26:13
I do not know the exact argument for this, it is just my opinion from what I have read, seen on the internet, charts, markets, etc.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:27:04
You could try coinmama or bitstamp, heard they are pretty good, also try [bitcanuck.ca]( if you are from Canada or [cryptocoin.pro]( if you are from EU
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:40:34
Those are great platforms, except coinbase, I heard just bad things about them lately
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:21:47
Very true, this would be a good time to invest, not the best but still good.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:38:12
Is this platform licensed to sell bitcoin or other altcoins ? Does it have a contract with visa/mastercard ? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:51:56
As a publicly-traded instrument, a bitcoin ETF has the ability to open a floodgate of capital from retail traders and individual accredited investors in the US public market. Dissimilar to direct investments on cryptocurrency exchange platforms, issuers of a bitcoin ETF are responsible for protecting the funds of investors and insuring them, as a trusted intermediary.  
As cryptocurrency investor and widely recognized content creator Nicholas Merten said:


@_date: 2018-07-27 14:11:40
Yeah I should have mentioned that, I was reffering to last year. There is no doubt that if you bought bitcoin when it came out and hold it that was the best investment.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:41:23
Paxful or localbitcoins is your best shot, look for a seller that accepts prepaid.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:37:31
What hashbon is trying to do is admirable, the banking cartel its simply designed to make rich people even richer, they are not interested in what a client needs.
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:29:18
You can try paxful or localbitcoins for a face2face sell
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:29:55
You should really avoid them anyway, better get a visa/mastercard card and look for some platform like coinmama, bitstamp, bitpanda if you are from USA, [bitcanuck.ca]( if you are from canada or even [cryptocoin.pro]( if you are from EU
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:44:20
My question is: does this apply to every country ? can it be used for USA also ? Thanks
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:32:51
From what I know most canadians use the interac-e transfer system to make online payment. I have a friend that uses something called [bitcanuk.ca]( You just have to verifiy an account and you can purchase bitcoins or altcoins with interac or wire transfer. Pretty easy.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:08:18
Open minded people already realised that but big companies are still afraid to invest and its understandable, all the regulations are still not in place, the market its still too volatile, etc Its more complicated that it seems 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:55:41
The article is very interesting giving the fact that there are a lot of other coins that were or are more profitable than bitcoin if you bought them in the past. But usually people tend to say bitcoin was the best investment simply because bitcoin is the most expensive one. I also agree, we won't see that growth with those coins again, but you can never know, maybe new coins will benefit from a similar rise.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:45:01
This some big news for skill, maybe I will start using them again
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:37:04
If you are not from US you have lots of other platforms to buy from bitpanda/cryptocoin.pro/etc
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:47:08
Exactly what he said, try contacting the bank and see if they can unblock it.
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:24:12
Hmm, from what I see, bitcoins is going up and alt coins are slowly falling, which is strange, but i do not think any of them is maintaining a stable price for too long
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:45:00
Be very careful about this kind of deals, I recommend to search for a well-known store that accepts bitcoin as payment if you want to use it. You do not want to lose your coins, it's not worth it, better convert your bitcoins in fiat and buying what you need from a store.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:34:56
That is a litte bit hard, every trusted/known platform asks for some kind of verification called KYC. You have some chances to find sellers on paxful or localbitcoins that would sell to you without any verification, give it a try.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:37:44
Each has its own pro/cons. It highly depends on the user's experience.
ETF and Shares are mainly for building your wealth slowly and on a long-term; Options is a contract agreed to buy/sell shares in the future, a form of insurance for your current shares, or a way to make a profit on a falling share price. Contracts for difference (CFDs) are an agreement between two parties (buyer and seller) to exchange the difference in the price of a security, from the time the contract opens to the time it closes.
For new users, the ETF is ok to start with but never with big amounts and always consider these:
1.What you buy
2.Beware conflicts of interest
3.Check collateral
4.Beware of currency fluctuations
5.Understand ETF performance
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:34:15
From what I know Canadians prefer the interac-e transfer system. I have a good friend in Canada that uses [bitcanuck.ca]( for buying/selling bitcoin and other coins. You should check it out maybe you find it useful.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:45:08
That is hard to predict, I think we will witness something similar to last year, with a rise in the price of bitcoin over the summer, and an even bigger one at the end of the year, I suspect all the other important coins will follow this trend. We could even see a big fall again before it gets to break the 10k barrier.
