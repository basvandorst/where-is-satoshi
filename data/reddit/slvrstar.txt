The bitcoin economy is too small and variable for this to be put in place. The bitcoin economy is large by some standards but the currency calculator is mostly if not exclusively used for national currencies(I could be wrong here). The bitcoin economy is smaller than that of most African and island countries, let alone major countries like the United States. Bitcoin needs a larger and more sturdy market before this is put in place. Besides there are plenty of bitcoin centric places to go if you are in need of a converter.

I see bitcoin ending up as an international currency. I see it as becoming **the** virtual currency. I think there will be websites that don't care about language, type of currency, location. They will accept bitcoins. I'd like to hope Bitcoin will unify the  web market in such a way that we have a totally accepted form of currency that can have assured value and assured acceptance.

The whole point of this is Steam does not accept bitcoins. Please read above comments before posting. u/flfolks asked a question that directly pertains to what you said and it was answered. Both of these things occurred 20 minutes before you posted.

Even if Knife Party are relatively popular, this move won't revolutionize the industry. Many people have tried this however successful it is there are many reasons why bands don't consistently sell straight to consumer.

I feel like that graph is slightly misleading. Please correct me if i'm wrong but that graph shows that gold fell 150 dollars. It doesn't show any information except for the fall. It doesn't show the increase in prices before that loss. The information on the right shows that gold has gained 575 dollars in the past 5 years. So gold does seem to be a good investment. I agree that people criticizing bitcoin after the crash aren't doing it justice, but I also think your comparison isn't fair.

I think you could be right about it not being a great investment. I'm not aware of the trends in the precious metal markets, in fact I'm just getting into bitcoin. I think there is always a time to get into any investment and someone said gold goes up when the economy crashes which I think is a definite explanation for the overall increase in gold price over 5 years. So while gold might not be a solid investment now, it was at one point in time and will be again.

Volatility affects the amount of time the converter must be updated. It also won't always be reliable and Google is very reputable, I doubt they want to be caught with the wrong conversion rate.

I think this is great and all but this won't be the match to light the bitcoin fire. Bands have done this before and while it was successful there is a reason it isn't given the repeat performance. Agents and "middlemen" companies are there for a reason. They have expertise in selling, booking, negotiating, and advertising. Also selling through bitcoin will not catch on until the entire economy of bitcoin becomes mainstream. I strongly believe endorsements from large organizations and people like famous musicians will help bitcoin grow, but I don't believe bitcoin will get these marketable figures until it has an audience that is worth the effort put forth to capture them

Why shouldn't the dev make some money? If valve doesn't think they will gain anything from adding bitcoin payment methods then why should they add it? This not only provides so competition for valve to put their own service in place but it also gives this guy who seems to be putting some of his own time and money into this a chance to make some money. Seems to bea  win-win from my perspective.

I think that before any major publications decide to publish that they think Bitcoin is viable as a currency there must be some stability. Rather than rapid periods of growth and descent, the world as well as these sorts of publication need to see a firm price, a price that changes but rarely leaves it's margin of error. It needs to be a secure place for money before they recommend people use it.
