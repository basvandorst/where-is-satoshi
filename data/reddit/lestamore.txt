The conditions for a free market include perfect competition, perfect information, no transaction costs, the assumption of rational decision making and probably a few others I forgot.  But these are not pragmatically possible.  Instead, we have a system where information takes looking for, there are costs associated with transactions, there are limited choices in many markets, and many people spend their money in dumb ways for a variety of reasons.  That is reality.  Trying to make the rules of classical economics fit reality is a lost cause because while it explains some things, it is a flawed model that doesn't have the flexibility to accommodate the ways people actually work.  See also market failures.  
So I feel like looking to market forces to do anything that needs accuracy or finesse is just unrealistic.  If someone is saying that the problem is that the free market as we know it isn't free enough and that is the problem, what I take away is that someone doesn't really get where the map and the territory actually differ quite a bit, and a lot of the regulation is in order to make it more closely resemble something that makes sense.

Basically we lost our capital, (got scammed once and made a couple bad investment decisions). And that led to having to me get a full time job which didn’t leave much time on top of the parenting gig.  Also, the most technical aspects of the whole thing were handled by a friend/ roommate who had some personal issues and kind of disappeared.  We also had 2 kids and could no longer gamble with our security.  And the mining hardware game changed so much, that every time we took a step back, it became more and more expensive to catch up.  Finally it’s a pretty intense life and we got a little burned out.
We weren’t crypto experts, just a young couple that wanted to get into something we were interested in as a hobby, and jumped in with both feet. (We had an old laundromat we rented for my husbands other business (phone sales) and used an inheritance check to buy two pallets of used computers and a bunch of GPUs to go in them.  We sold practically all the bitcoins we mined there to pay the power bill but in the end we got to live off the whole thing for about 3 years and then in a few more years put a down payment on a house, so I call it a success.
Actually depending on my mood I either call it a success or am consumed with regret that we had no idea wtf we were doing.  But mostly the first one ��.

I think 100$ is way too low with what we have going on in the US now.  But maybe around 500$?  I don't think it is bad for it to be an investment, partly because I think that it has more potential than as 'just' a currency and that developing that potential, and even the process of making it easier to use as a currency is going to keep the price somewhat volatile, for that matter 28nm and the next halving are both going down next year and have nothing to do with speculation but will likely bounce the price around a bit.
I think given that BTC needs to be used alongside other currencies (because other currencies aren't going anywhere atm), the easy exchange between them is going to be a key point in minimizing the impact of shocks of all kinds.  So honestly, I think that until we can get that aspect down, it is going to be hard for anyone to use BTC 'simply' as a currency and not an investment.  So basically, until we have a solid exchange infrastructure, I think stuff like this china situation or other investment related ups and downs are a part of life.  The fact that BTC has so much potential and attracts investment I think is actually a good sign in the meantime since it makes that infrastructure and basically capitol investment possible.  If all the worlds major nations cracked down on BTC in the way China did, I don't think it would die, but rather go underground, not be widely used, and we would see much more stable prices maybe around 100$.  But I think Bitcoin can do better than that.

For one thing, he had to know that the earliest miners would be controlling bitcoins that would be getting increasingly valuable.  If people knew who he was, it would be assumed, rightly or wrongly that he was rich and that could make him a target.  He had no way of knowing that btc would be as successful as it was, but even if bitcoin had only reached the price of a few dollars a piece, he would have people talking about him and all his money and it could be he just wasn't comfortable with that.  And he also had to know that the potential for bitcoin to take off was there, in which case this issue would be even greater.
Also, it is harder to make allegations about a pyramid scheme if the guy on top not only is absent, but also never spends or moves money.  Maybe he wanted to instill trust that he wasn't trying to scam anyone.
Finally, the original idea with bitcoin was one cpu, one vote.  If Satoshi was an anarchist of any sort, he had to believe that the bitcoin movement doesn't need 'leaders' and that having someone who is considered a spokesman/figurehead, whether it is actually true or not, hurts the credibility of the system.  Those are just a few thoughts on the matter.

If you spent your money on bitcoin you will make a much better faster profit in the short term than if you bought gear.  Gear is also a bit overpriced at the moment because the way difficulty works, mining will always be only marginally profitable, but institutional mining operations have a much lower cost per hash so on the average they will be kindof hogging the margin until market forces drive down the price of gear to about 10 per Mh or so with current technology.
One option if you are really keen on mining is cloud hashing like CEX.io  The price of the shares tends to decline faster than the mining profits stacks up, but if you are good at trading you have a better shot making bitcoins on that than just trading bitcoin I think. Or keep your eye out for other institutional level mining services that you could buy into, as long as they start paying right away.

Right now, coinbase is the easiest way.  And everyone has to wait 4 days for their first transactions, having a Visa doesn't matter.  Honestly even coinbase is a lot faster than the previous best way which was making an exchange account, scanning your id and utility bill to confirm your identity, waiting for it to be approved, signing up with a 3rd party, getting verified, linking your financial info, and then transferring money from your bank to one to the other, and often not being able to withdraw money in the way you deposited it.  Call it a cost of being an early adopter.  I think everyone wants it to be easier, many people are working on it, but the weak link is the banks, who by and large wont cooperate.  
The only better way at the moment is to find a real live bitcoin user and buy coins from them.  Localbitcoins.com is set up to help you do that, but it relies on a system of trust so as a new person, your options could be limited.
As for your second question, yes dogecoin is a coin that is a joke, there are lots and lots of alternative coins, and people who know how to make them can just do it for a joke.  It caught on because it was a popular joke, and not because it has anything in particular to offer, unlike many other alts.  Dogecoin cannot compete with bitcoin because the size of the bitcoin network is huge and that means it is way way way more secure than dogecoin which is being mined by just a few.  A website called Cryptsy is I think the most popular place to trade dogecoin and the many other alt coins.
And as for your also, nobody knows exactly how it will play out, but by processing payments, erstwhile miners can collect network tips which hopefully in 20 years will be worth enough to keep their hashing power online.

I am curious if we will see the obsoleted hashing turned to alts as a trend.  Will we see predictable changes in the power going into alts as the ratio of hashing to bitcoin price changes?  Maybe this is already established, but I haven't seen anyone talking about it.

People wanting to take advantage of the good features bitcoin provides, like security and ease of transaction, and people speculating that the price will go up more.  They do this because more and more people are using bitcoin world wide, because of bitcoins many good features, and because it looks like due to the congressional hearing today, it will be even easier and safer to use bitcoin in the future.

because if you can make mining equipment, why sell it for less than you would make using it.  Institutional mining is here.  There will always be co-ops and whatnot for some, but the big operations are hogging the margins so I don't see mining as a profitable option for most.  Will this centralization kill bitcoin?  That is a question for down the road.

I really don't see why it is necessary that bitcoin operate as a conventional currency on its own.  Why is it bad to exchange it with other currencies?  It seems like the ability to do that is a strength, since it looks like people like national economies that can be controlled to some extent by their governments.  The ability to change the money supply and intrest rates while we can argue about whether or why it should be done, seems like obviously an advantage in general.  Since bitcoin doesn't work that way, why shouldn't we use both?  I mean, can't bitcoin keep fiat honest, and fiat keep bitcoin practical?  
As Bitcoin is a protocol, I kindof don't understand why everyone wants it to be a traditional currency.  Wouldn't it be more flexible to see what we need and mold our use based on that, rather than having assumptions and expectations based on the past?  
As an economics major, I feel like it is important to point out that economics is not a hard science, and everything macro is theory.  All we have to test our theories is what has happened in the past, but bitcoin is pretty clearly a break from what has been done before, so while all opinions are not equally valid, just because an economist said something about deflation or whatnot, it doesn't make it unassailable truth.  So I guess talking about the far future of bitcoin is hard to do with much certainty.  The next year or 2 will make a lot of difference on how bitcoin grows and is used and I think that is as relevant to endgame as anything we can say at the moment about full global adoption.

I don't think this is that bad.  Have any banks ever been involved with bitcoin?  That is just not how it has operated so to say that that avenue being blocked is responsible for a loss of value to this degree doesn't make sense.  I think the truth is, there was a speculative bubble.  I don't think that is bad, but if everyone who doesn't understand bitcoin sells, it will make a big impact because bitcoin is hard to really get.  I mean, cryptography and macroeconomics are two of the most confusing things ever, so if investors are skittish because they don't really have confidence in their understanding of what is going on it is reasonable.  Fortunately, those who do get it will make more and more $ developing BTC and that is what will drive stability.  It is still early for that though.

They are easy to spend on coinbase, so I have a coinbase wallet with just my spending bitcoins.  I also have some in online accounts because I trust their security more than I trust my own pathetic understanding of the subject.  And then I also have an electrum wallet which is basically offline but also keeps an encrypted backup that can be accessed via a seed.  I used to have the bitcoin.qt wallet, but honestly I was really paranoid about having to back it up myself because my husband's got corrupted, and the more you use it the more often it needs backed up, which means more opportunities for a non-tech person to fuck it up.

I think it is really important that banks feel it is safe to support bitcoin businesses.  A lot of people think banks are antithetical to bitcoin, but I feel like in the long run, bitcoin can solve a lot of banking problems.  Right now one of the biggest things holding back innovation and keeping people from making the most of bitcoin is the fact that no bitcoin businesses can get bank accounts. If banks know that businesses that use bitcoins are not by a legal liability to them, America can take the potential of bitcoin and use it to make the country and the world better.

They could try, but they can't regulate non-US citizens, and even if it was some international body trying to enforce that, anonymity is such a benefit, that I am sure you would see non-compliant wallets appearing.  They would like to outlaw music and movie piracy too, and guess what, it is illegal, and people still do it all the time.  
And I think they don't really have the choice to make it illegal at this point since people are already using it, trying to ignore it would be basically giving the power of the network away to other countries, and to do that they would be at risk of infringing on other non BTC digital currencies which are also anonymous by nature.  
So I guess I would say, let them try, if they want to be jerks, and we'll see how it goes for them.

The thing about bitcoin is, that it's value is tied up in the bitcoin network, which is the most powerful computer network ever to exist.  It took years of miners all over the world racing for more and more powerful gear to build the network to what it is now.  No other crypto has that, and until one does, anything built on the BTC model will be vulnerable to attack.  So I don't see anyone seriously leaving bitcoin who understands why it is what it is.  Other cryptos might gain some traction, but it will be very hard for any to catch up given that mining anything else is a much bigger risk.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:58:22
Actually, the price of the dollar fluctuates pretty widely too, but since everyone in the US uses dollars, we take it for granted and don't worry about what a dollar is actually worth from day to day.

Yeah, but people are constantly talking about bitcoin as a conventional currency.  Is the deflation thing even an issue for bitcoin if people are using it alongside fiat?

@_date: 2013-12-19 07:57:41
There is so much more infrastructure needed, but it is evident that the niche is being filled.  Millions in venture capitol are just barely starting to be spent.  Companies like coinbase and bitpay are just getting started and definitely working out kinks still.  The mining scene is changing a lot as big players spend hundreds of thousands on big operations.  Next year, we can expect another halving too.  All of these things suggest to me that bitcoin has nowhere near peaked.  For that matter, you are just catching on, but I bet you know people who will take more to convince them.  Bitcoin has a lot further to go.  So I would say you have not missed the boat.  You may not see a 10,000% increase on your investment like the 2$ BTC crowd can expect to maybe, but I think it is a better bet than just about anything else you can find with similar risk.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:33:57
In bitcoin mining, a block is discovered on a somewhat regular schedule that is based on how much mining power is going into the network.  When there is more power, it becomes harder to find a block in order to keep the rate of broken blocks roughly the same.  That is difficulty going up.  If mining power were to decrease, it would become easier to find blocks.
You might want to do some basic research on bitcoin mining if you don't understand.

so you think governments will try to keep people from exchanging one to another?  Do you think it is a matter of time in the US?  I sortof feel like when bitcoin hits a critical mass, governments are going to want a piece themselves.  I mean, there are already US rules now about contributing bitcoin to political campaigns.  And if bitcoin was doing better than banks I have to wonder if they would double down, or what.  Would a serious bitcoin lobby make a difference?  When people talk about the deflationary future of bitcoin for example, do you think they are talking about it in this semi-underground context?

This is not the best time to mine, but CEX.io lets you buy shares in their mining operation that can then also be traded.  They produce immediately and are a better deal in $/Mh than a lot of other options.  Be careful though, because as difficulty increases the value of the shares drops, and you can wipe out your investment when you cash out.

The trust is the cryptography and the network.  The bitcoin network is made up of more computing power than has ever been put together for a common purpose in history.

There is a difference between hoarding bitcoins, saving, and refraining from panic selling.

There is no reason that in the future, due to their security and transparency, they couldn't be the basis of a new currency in the way that gold once was.  This would be a lot more practical than a gold standard and a lot more reliable than what we do now which is basically to trust the Fed to know what the right thing to do is, and to do it (because the blockchain is public, so there will always be at least some accountability).

Or for those who don't like the idea of tying it with taxes, when you register to vote, you might need to provide an address to send the token to (or they might just give you one.)
The only problem I see is that it isn't exactly anonymous. If people find out who you vote for, it could lead to problems.  But maybe there could be an anonymization step on voting day to cover that for people who are concerned.  
I would be more worried about companies or interests literally buying votes rather than people in other countries.  It would be a lot easier to just offer cash for tokens than it would to convince people of anything.  It could lead to corruption like crazy.  Obviously I guess that would have to be illegal.  And with the transparency aspect, probably actually detectable and preventable.

This sounds so cool.  I love treasure hunts and used to make up sets of clues to give my friends.  You could make a qr code for the wallet and put it on a website somewhere.  Then have the url be the solution to your riddle.  There are a million options for clues, especially if you want your treasure hunt to be based irl in some town.  If you want it internet wide, there are still a lot of potential ways to hide clues, that might lead to more clues etc.  Here are some quick brainstorms I had. 
Clues could be incorporated in:
a home made text game,
ebay auctions,
google streetview details,
public game servers,
comments on articles,
reverse image searches,
yelp reviews,
craigslist personals,
even unrelated reddit threads,
classic books or movies that are available online,
even a free google voice phone number with a related message on the voicemail.
Maybe do some research on ARGs for other ideas.
If you had a lot of time on your hands, you could even weave a bunch of these together in a narrative and develop a character for your hunters to follow around the internet.  That might be too much though idk what you are thinking of doing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:32:40
I couldn't leave a comment on the article so I will put it here:
Another point I rarely see made, that I feel is so important, is that the computing power of the network is directly proportional to it's security.  Also, the more bitcoins are worth, the more the network grows.  So the value of bitcoin is directly proportional to how secure each bitcoin transaction is.  
This is so important because as more of our lives happen online, we have to be aware that although people talk about "cyber-war" and things like that in conspiracy theory terms, or with dismissal that it is only relevant to people who have to deal with tech on an intimate basis, at a certain point malicious application of large amounts of processing power is a serious threat to the security of anything we do digitally.  We look at the hijinks of groups like Anonymous and while they can make a difference or upset people here or there, we are entering an era where computers and being connected digitally is a basic part of modern life.  Internet access has even been discussed as a human right.  In a few generations, the potential for worldwide internet participation in the internet and the potential for large groups of people who are computer literate and disagree on fundamental issues to cause problems for eachother seems worth being concerned with.  If digital commerce is important, and it is, the importance of this kind of unprecidented security offered by the bitcoin network should not be undervalued.  
Also with conventional currency, the security of the system depends on the country's ability to protect and pay for itself.  That is not to be taken for granted, especially given the proportion of the worlds population that live under unstable regimes.  We totally ignore the value of this security when we think about the dollar, because we would all like to think of ourselves as islands, creating economic value independant of our meddling govenments, but the capitol investment that has gone into national economic security is there regardless, providing utility and giving us a footing to engage in economic activity without worrying about the value of our money.  But not taking this into account as part of the value of the dollar seems to me like fish who take for granted the water they swim in.  It is NOT a given.  It IS of value and is built into the bitcoin protocol so while the bitcoin network functions like a company stock, it also functions like a national government in terms of safeguarding the people's investments. 
 So I could get really carried away talking about this, because I think it is just such an important point.  But I'm sure you get the picture.

I have accounts on some of the major exchanges.  But I wouldnt presume to give you advice on what exchange to trust.  A lot of exchanges have gone bust and taken everyone's bitcoins.  So it is definitely at your own risk.  Maybe ask around for what has the best reputation.  And I have no idea about storing alts.

I think bitcoin is a great idea, but I think this forum is not exactly full of dispassionate experts.  My advice is to keep researching, and get in just as much as you feel comfortable.  See for yourself what the benefits are and if you have questions, resolve to get to the bottom of them.  I feel like where critics go wrong is either making a judgement before fully understanding what bitcoin is and what it offers, or else never taking action to get involved, but rather putting it off or coming up with excuses.  A good way to learn more might be to find an in person Meetup where you can talk and ask questions to people who have experience dealing with it.  I mostly learned by talking to other people I know or googling specific questions.

I don't know, I am thinking of selling my ASIC because I wonder if the bitcoins it will mine will ever be equal to the bitcoin I could buy if I sold it.  Still profitable, but what about opportunity cost..

Also, the decision was half made a few months ago when FinCen released regulations regarding digital currencies.
Not only can bitcoin literally not be stopped, it is juuust similar enough to all kinds of other digital "money" everything from 2nd Life and WoW $ to box store gift cards, that nailing down the difference between bad digital money and good digital money would potentially have unintended effects on companies that like to give them money.  Politicians like money.  Most of the regulative language doesn't even really apply to a decentralized currency like BTC.

Have you ever heard of the theories of Carlota Perez?  
Basically she writes about the way technology catches on and spreads throughout society, from the industrial revolution to the internet.  
It points out that the financial world is basically living in the past.  
Then there is the fact that bitcoin is supported by the most powerful computer network in history which makes it more secure than any other digital thing ever and quite honestly, more secure than just about any non-digital store of value also.  
Combine these two elements with the fact that it is independant of any governing body that could have a motive to mess it up, and the fact that it is gaining wide acceptance and now with the positive stuff coming out of the US congressional hearing, it looks pretty likely to me and many others that bitcoin, or something that bitcoin will evolve into is the first step in a new way that people use money.

I think there will be spikes and corrections in the next few weeks, and quite possibly a big 'crash' at some point.  But there is no guarantee that the bottom will be much lower than we see right now.  If you are serious about bitcoin, get in with whatever you can afford.  I think that in the long run, the difference between getting in at 600 vs. 800 will be not that big a deal, when they are 20,000 apeice.  But that is several years away.  If you want a short term investment, then.. I think it is hard to predict.
