Well if Kleiman was Satoshi and Wright knew that and also knew that no one else knew, he might be trying to lay the ground work to claim some or all of Satoshi's coins using the legal system.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:31:42
This is absolutely the saddest part of this ride.  As I explore this theory, I am exposed more and more to the possibility that Satoshi really is gone and that we will never get to learn more.  I am really hoping that if Kleiman was Satoshi that he wrote it all down and cryptographically signed it for future generations.

You need to learn about the subject you are discussing.

There is really no substance to this submission.

My theory is that Wright believes Kleiman was Satoshi and he thinks Kleiman's relative, Ira, who has Kleiman's USB stick is in possesion of Satoshi's coins.  So he is trying to lay the ground work to sue Ira and claim the coins.  He has already tried to establish that he is Satoshi and that he 'loaned' Kleiman the 1.1 Million coins.  I think this is all a setup for later to sue Ira for what is 'his'.

All he has to do is sign the message "boop" to the genesis block and everyone will flip their shit.

You're talking about Leo, right?  I am very interested to know what happens with this!
  
Edit: Are you visiting his brother Leo or his half brother Ira?

How are Finney and Kleinman connected?
  
I just posted my theory in another thread:

So far Wright hasn't demonstrated any unique knowledge.  The proof he did for Gavin was using publicly accessible information.  If he signed the genesis block or even one close to it and did it on the blockchain, it would quickly end all this, but I don't think he can and I think his motives are for profit and that he is playing a long game because the payoff is potentially massive.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:25:38
It's useful as an investment for me.  I can buy small amounts at a time with potential for a huge payoff later and I struggle to think of another investment I can do this with that is inclusive for people like me.  I bought a bunch of bits when they were $230 and they have doubled in price.  I am convinced this thing is just getting started and I am young enough to make this gamble with my spare change.  It's given me a brighter outlook on my financial future, something I didn't have before I found bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:31:19
That's not proof that Wright has keys from block 
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:52:39
He looks like your average white guy, he blends in pretty well.

You might have a leg to stand on if the evidence stood up, but it doesn't and you're just irritating me by not distributing your empathy equally among all parties.  We all deal with things differently and the parties you mentioned are all familiar with Wright and they called it right.  They are setting a bar for what is expected going forward and I agree with it.  Anyone who comes forward and tries to claim they are Satoshi better be able to prove it or face ridicule.

I'm not the only person with this theory and a shit ton of attention is about to descend on Kleinman's relative, Ira, so maybe we are close to answers.  I think Wright is going to make a play for Satoshi's coins using the legal system and that could potentially tie up Satoshi's coins for a long time.  This could get very interesting.  I'm also interested in the blowback for Wright if it is clear he is trying to steal from Satoshi and his relative who he potentially entrusted with the coins.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:09:03
The drama is that Satoshi is sitting on a huge amount of a finite asset and most people who have bought in have done so because it is finite.  Suddenly having a million bitcoins come into play is a big deal.  We all know the possibility is there, but we become complacent the longer time goes on so these Satoshi episodes are a reminder that gets us stirred up.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:21:34
He doesn't need to convince us if his goal is to simply create enough doubt to convince a judge\jury to give him some or all of Satoshi's coins.

It's not clear to me whether the case would take place in AUS or USA.  And I have no faith in the court system to arrive at the correct answer in either country.

I can use it as an API between my account and whoever.  So I can keep the tweets flowing from the same IP they have always come from while getting paid either up front or as they go.  I would prefer upfront so they can't correlate transactions to tweets.

Gogle it?  What is this amateur hour?
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:44:39
He just needs to convince a court, not the court of public opinion.  That could explain why is so defiant towards the public but still putting himself out there and contradicting himself.  He needs to establish he is Satoshi if he is going to convince a court of law.  Even if he can just convince them he was involved he could walk away with a percentage of Satoshi's coins.  His real problem will be the blowback it will create, if the wrong person is convinced he stole from Satoshi, he is fucked.

None of what you just said is guaranteed.  Transaction fees are not guaranteed.  Confirmation times are not guaranteed.  Increased adoption is not guaranteed.  Higher price is not guaranteed.

Because the potential for somewhere between 100,000 and 1,000,000 coins being dumped on the market just went up exponentially. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:21:59


   
People who have bought bitcoin because of its distribution model are constantly worried that Satoshi's coins will come back into play because that is a lot of coins, enough to offset and possibly negate this years halving, something we have all been looking forward to since the last halving.  It's a pretty big deal.

I hadn't considered the cluster part and I'm amused that I missed it given it was big news when he first tried to make his claim.  Everyone was wondering why he would have a cluster and whether the cluster was even real.  But the motive to buy a big cluster and maybe take out loans you can't repay to build it makes sense if you consider he was expecting a big payoff if he could decrypt the drive.  In addition, it makes total sense of why you would want to build your own instead of renting one because in this particular scenario privacy would be of the utmost importance.  I like this, it fits.

I have a 4 letter twitter handle that I have received numerous requests over the years to buy.  I could set up a system that gives them the ability to use that handle while still maintaining control over the account.
  
I've also considered making an easy to set up webcam solution that allows people to rent out a feed for bitcoin and later other payment mechanisms as 21.co integrates them.  I expect 21.co will be dealing with a lot of video feeds in the future.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:58:49
You asked what is the difference, what is the big deal, and I answered it.  We can speculate until the cows come home but my explanation is ultimately why everyone is so interested in Satoshi.  If Satoshi had sold or given away all his coins early on, we wouldn't be giving this the attention it has.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:01:45
Can you show me where there is any proof that Wright was involved in the early days?
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:30:53
I laugh at your pre-emptive laugh.  You should change accounts.

Criticism of Gavin is absolutely warranted in this situation.  It is clear that he did not do due diligence.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:58:49
He has tax problems and is being investigated by the ATO.  Also it turns out he used tax incentives to take out a loan and build a compute cluster.  We have speculated why he would build a cluster when there are plenty to rent and we have speculated whether the cluster ever existed.  But if it did exist, one very good reason to build your own cluster is because the information that will exist on that cluster is extremely sensitive.  Sensitive information like Satoshi's wallet for example or more likely an encrypted container that he thinks holds the wallet and maybe more.  
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:12:21
Balaji is Satoshi.  But if he isn't, he might be wrong here, Wright might sue the Kleiman estate and try and claim some of it if it turns out he really was Satoshi.

I've been saying this for years.  India has so many goldbugs and bitcoin appeals to goldbugs.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:40:35
Can you show any proof that he was involved early?
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:44:47
Let's not dismiss the possibility that the contents are time locked and that no one can access them until a certain date.  If we explore this premise, it might explain why Wright chose the date of 2020 on the contract for when he was supposed to be paid back 100,000 bitcoins.  So if he knew that the contents were locked until 2020, then this could all be a long con to establish his place and sue.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:56:06


  
I don't believe Wright is Satoshi but I want to point out that there isn't a systems administrator worth their salt who wouldn't tunnel their traffic over a secure connection like VPN when using public internet access.
