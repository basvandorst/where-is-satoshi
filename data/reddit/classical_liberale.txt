Its both. Trading for the most traded good (money) also helped economy grow complex beyond barter and when that most traded good stopped having tangible consumption it became an instrument to track debt.
The idea that money is exclusively a way to keep track of debt, only works in the context of fiat currency and has lot of evidence from middle ages and other civilizations. But there are a lot more incidences of how money works in inter-kingdom trade and inter-civilization trade.
Romans trading with South India, had to have actual gold and silver coinage or actual goods and animals for trade (real exchange of value), rather than just trading sovereign debt of Rome (aka bronze sestercii etc..)

Isn't controlling the money supply and inflating it an indirect tax? An hidden but truly insidious tax.

When you have 1000s of dealers and one of the dealers is robbed it may be fine. When all you got is 5 dealers and one of the dealers is robbed of 10% of his inventory, then it is not fine.

We already have the dollar today doing that. More than 90% (maybe much more) of the USD transactions are digital. With tie-ups between big banks, much of those digital transactions are instantaneous. The transaction cost is high but not due to maintenance or operation cost for the banks, but due to arbitrary pricing empowered by their Oligopoly status.
So we have a government-backed digital currency already with many benefits and so what the hell are we doing here talking about and using bitcoin?

If people keep re-using addresses then the law will be enforceable.
Also a single individual will think twice before dodging taxes.
Take current income taxes for example. Even if you pay your taxes correctly or already have tax deducted at source, you still have to file your returns with the IRS. The IRS can penalize you for not preparing your returns even if you paid taxes correctly or paid extra taxes. Now if, no one does their returns then IRS cannot effectively enforce the law on every-one. But what they do is select a few people and bully them into filing their returns, the rest of us fear the same consequences and follow the line.

The State (prosecution) petitions the State (the court) to disallow defense's evidence. No surprise there and sure doesn't look good.

They will be capable, but very difficult to do unless the benefit they give is many magnitudes better than what we have with bitcoin. One would argue that Bitcoin is a vastly superior currency to USD due to its scarcity, durability, fungibility etc.. But why hasn't it overtaken USD already. Why is the rise of BTC against USD so slow and feels like an uphill task.
See  In addition to network effects the Government regulations and restrictions make adoption of BTC against USD all the more difficult.
Real-life example where Friedman's prediction of dominance of network effects won and Hayek's competing currencies failed to make an impact -

Lol, yes. Didn't want to sound too discouraging to lazooz folks.

There are multiple angles to look at.
First of all (real) GDP is an aggregate indicator that can mean nothing to many people.
See real wages average 
See real household income median 
The above indicators are adjusted for CPI and show a stagnation in real income, but if you adjust them to real GDP the stagnation of wages will turn into a fall of wages.
Monetary inflation may not immediately result in price inflation due to various reasons and the Central Banks (especial the US Fed) have multiple tools is delaying the inevitable price inflation. So just pointing to (real) GDP doesn't take away the fact that people are being robbed of their product either directly (direct taxes, licensure and this greek/cyprus style hair-cut) or indirectly (monetary inflation, devaluing of currency)
The current Monetary inflation doesn't affect the CPI very much due to 2 primary reasons: 1) Export inflation to other countries by using USD's world reserve currency demand either by issuing debt bonds denominated in USD or by printing/creating money; 2) Local banks and other players buy these debts or get other forms of new money from the Government.
As you can see, price inflation is seen highest in those sectors where the initial receivers of new money spend it aka the stock market, derivates market, physical real estate etc.. As the money keeps moving hands in the economy, the sectors where the money reaches first see more price inflation and the sectors that get the money late see little inflation.
So monetary inflation is a wealth re-distribution scam perpetrated by the Central banks to benefit their well connected groups while leaving everyone else with a debased currency.

Unfortunately zooz tokens are an alt-currency and so they will not take off, unless something dramatic happens to BTC.

Nice, every time I take a ride, I try to explain decentralized tech and how Uber is centralized co-ordinator and the day is not far away when he can keep 100% of what I pay. I also kinda warn them about self-driving cars.

I am not even sure how the FinCEN's regulations from a few months back affect Coinbase, Circle etc.
If it covers any wallet provider (and will cover Uber if they manage wallets), then it is better for Uber to piggy-back on Coinbase and Bitpay for payment processing. I'm sure the fees are very thin compared to Visa and sub-processors.

Expanding the money supply and helping special interests is also the same. Monetary inflation is an always on invisible tax that has been slowly sucking away everyone's product.
But yeah things like cyprus and greece brings out these practices to the light.

Can work if Uber creates a wallet (that it controls) for your Uber account, where you move some BTC before-hand to be used for rides (kinda like prepaid secure credit-cards). This way the transaction of money is friction-free, under most conditions.

They take 20% of what they charge the customer. I don't think that it is 'small' and they will keep making money even with bitcoin payments.
