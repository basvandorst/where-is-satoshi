No, you do not need to buy a full bitcoin in order for it to be worth something. The amount you hold, however small it may be, will grow in value. 
Keep in mind the more bitcoin you hold the greater the returns, but the more risk you’re exposing yourself to. 0.00095 btc is only about $15 usd. 
If you don’t want to risk anymore money that’s fine, but it will take a very substantial rise in the price in order for your fraction of a bitcoin to be worth anything to get excited over.

Time locks are a part of it. 
It is up to you to decide how long it might be, but it would probably be a matter of hours to days before automatic settling would occur.

I’m not a CPA, but of my understanding any capital gains realized from a conversion of one asset into another (not exclusively that asset into fiat) is a taxable event, at least in the US. I have no idea what the laws for EU citizens are. 
I’m sure that if a person wanted to go out and pay an accountant to finagle some numbers/find back doors they could do so. However, for your average joe, who does not want to pay for an accountant, this is extremely ill advised and spreading information that says otherwise (regarding what is considered a taxable event in the US and what is not) is detrimental. 
If you’d like to quote the specific passage in your link where you feel this contradicts what I’m saying I’d be happy to review it.

Agreed. I think it will survive as an investment vehicle/store of value very easily until it’s *ready* to be used as an everyday currency. 
Right now the tech simply isn’t there yet. That’s not to say it never will be, we just have to be patient and keep reminding ourselves that everything having to do with bitcoin is a very long term perspective.

These transfers will ultimately collapse down to a single normal-sized channel closing transaction, even if there are millions of them involved.
In other words, LN allows for the ability to make literally millions of transactions per second without bloating your channel or the blockchain. Elizabeth Stark, one of the inventors of LN, hypothesizes that even machines/bots will be utilizing LN. For what purpose we still don’t know. 


How do you currently keep your BTC secure? 
The LN compatible wallets will work the exact same way any other secure BTC wallet currently works. You don’t have to use a phone app and if you’re more comfortable with a wallet on your PC that’s perfectly fine. 
You can always export backups of your keys as needed. Again, there’s no need for a third party custodian of these keys in the slightest. LN does not introduce new need in that regard. 


First, LN *is* a solution to scalability. It is the checking account of btc transactions. Not only that, but it acts as a filter on top of the blockchain. 
The blockchain probably shouldn’t be used for tiny insignificant purchases. Why do you need your $3 coffee purchase published to the blockchain? The option will still be available to you if that’s what you want, but it isn’t necessary. LN would allow you to make an entire years worth of $3 coffee transactions and then publish all those transactions to the blockchain as one single channel-closing transaction. 
LN effectively filters out all of the insignificant transactions and only publishes transactions to the blockchain that matter. This will clear up a lot of blockchain space and will hopefully help lower transaction times and fees even on the bottom layer.
The days of penny fees on the blockchain are gone, but that was only a matter of time anyway as we will eventually need to move to a fee based model once block rewards are too minuscule for mining to be worth it. 


You pay at least two fees when using LN: once when opening the payment channel and a second time when closing the payment channel. These two transactions must be published to the blockchain. 
Anytime you want to transfer more funds into your LN payment channel this will always require a transaction published to the blockchain which will result in paying miner fees.

Absolutely worth it. Think about how many bits or satoshis you’ll be getting! 
($20 is like +100,000 satoshi. Worth.) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:22:18


This is not correct - unless the US gov recently updated the rules and I haven’t heard about it. 
Anytime you’re converting it is considered a taxable event. The only time it’s not is when you convert fiat into bitcoin or if you sell at a loss. 
Beyond that anytime you move your bitcoin into anything else, altcoins included, it is taxable. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:43:00
Yeah I’ve heard this and it’s one aspect I’m not super looking forward to, but I know I’ll be able to deal with. 
Also already mourning the loss of iMessage. Which really is great

That’s great to hear! I’ll be coming from an iPhone 6s. 
I’ve been a long time iOS user, but I’ve been growing increasingly tired of it. The Pixel 2 xl will be my first android experience and I’m really excited.

Hey no worries. I hope this seminars was held for EU citizens /specific to your country? If so that makes sense, but I’m not sure why you’d think the same laws would apply to US taxes? Unless they explicitly stated 
The whole point I was trying to make was specific to US taxes - which are the only laws I’m familiar with (being a US citizen) and feel comfortable arguing about lol 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:14:42
Dope! That’s great to hear
I lurked around r/googlepixel for a while, but I had to get out of there after realizing that I was starting to care about “problems” I normally wouldn’t care about or even notice on my own time. The vocal minority is incredibly vocal over in that sub lol.

Are you tweeting at Coinbase the company or Brian Armstrong? 
You know what? I gonna do both just to be safe 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:39:07
Bullish or not, anytime a whale sells 1000 at a time I celebrate. A very substantial amount of btc was just redistributed into the market. Definitely a good thing. 
Edit: typo

The majority of the community has been pro-segwit, but anti Segwit2x - which was a hard fork that implemented segwit as well as increasing the block size to 2mb. 
This hardfork was proposed and agreed upon behind closed doors by financial institutions (like Coinbase) and miners, effectively leaving out the devs and the community in the decision. This goes against some core principles of bitcoin and what it represents so thankfully it was never executed.

Bcash is absolutely about money. 
Bcash should be renamed: Jihan+Roger ASICBoost Mining Coin! 
Let’s not forget that Jihan started throwing a fit because he was going to lose a lot of money on his (almost defunct) ASICBoost chips. Roger didn’t get involved until he had a secret meeting with Jihan and it’s pretty easy to speculate that they shook up a deal with each other and their respective mining pools. 
It’s pretty fucking nefarious no matter how you look at it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:24:53
It’s not an insult. Roger claims it’s an insult because he desperately wants to benefit off of bitcoin branding. 
If bcash we’re always called bcash there wouldn’t be much confusion in the market. That goes against nearly everything Roger is trying to do with this coin. It’s pretty nefarious.

Take *some* profits. Buy the dip(s). Hodl forever.

It will render past forks and a lot of altcoins redundant. 
What we’re experiencing with btc are some very uncomfortable growing pains and forks/alts are trying to capitalize on it. 
I don’t blame them for doing so. Staying ahead of the innovation curve is an “every man for himself” mentality and always has been. Hopefully bitcoin is able to fully adopt segwit+LN fast enough in order to substantially stay ahead of the curve. I have faith that it will do so.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:14:16
In the US every trade you make is a taxable event.

We don’t see them as much anymore, but they used to happen all the time just a few years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:54
Last time it took ~2 years. 
I wouldn’t be surprised to see another multi year long bear market soon at our doorstep. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:31:04
I’m actually kind of anxious for the crash - in a good way. I’m not ready for mainstream adoption to occur. I want at least one more crash -&gt; bear market cycle before mainstream takes off because I need more cheap coin buying opportunities. 
This bubble has been amazing and has surpassed any and all expectations, but it’s not going to last forever. 
The previous bear market lasted ~2 years. This bull market is coming on 2+ years. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the next bear market last just as long, if not longer. Best start emotionally preparing yourselves now and remember to buy the dips! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:57:23
You raise a good point actually. We *are* giving him too much credibility in the space. Just because he was in on the ground floor doesn’t mean he has some magic understanding that no one else does. 
Long term I’m not too worried about bcash. Short term they’re going to continue to be annoying af to deal with. 
Hoping not too many (mostly new) people get burned in the process of trying to figure it all out.

You can open a LN payment channel with as little or as much btc as you like. 
If you’re going to be using that btc to make transactions anyway I don’t really see the downside to keeping it stored in LN. It is still a secure way to hold your btc regardless. 
Think of LN as a checking account. You have your btc set aside for spending and you have your cold storage btc for savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:59:25
Why did you keep your btc on circle when they announced they weren’t supporting btc anymore like at least a year ago? 
Why are you blaming other people for your own laziness and negligence? 
Good luck with that class action. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:45:18
Nah, I totally agree. 
I didn’t mean to sound so contradictory in my initial response to you. I only meant that money is still a fairly big underlying factor. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:44:57
Yes, and good point. Really smart observation. Thank you for the discussion
You’ll need a local backup of your most recent transaction in order to close the payment channel and publish onto the blockchain.
