Just did a little write up on ssss:
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:02:19
Have only used local exchange with people, no need for an exchange.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:19:43
Good luck with that, Heard HK is ;)

None of it is tied to my identity. IBAN cards are like prepaid w/ the added benefit of having a bank account affiliated with the card.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:47:32
Problem is that I would rather not set it up in my name &amp; be able to do it independent of my personal accounts. In the true nature of bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:30:56
I'm planning on being out for another 6-8 months, maybe more. Don't want to blow through too much btc having fun. Let me tally this up for you, I'll try and figure out how much I spent &amp; what the fiat equivalent was.
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:12:23
The blockchain is a public ledger, yet once funds are mixed, or moved from btc -&gt; fiat (with certain precautions), or just spent outright (with one time use inputs / outputs),
To be honest I was kinda stoned when I wrote that &amp; forgot all about it, thanks for reminding me to delete that shit :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:03:32
I will have to make a more detailed post just about IBAN cards. I have gathered a bunch of info, and have gained a bunch of experience from using them.
Little tidbit, you can load these cards as much as you would like if you use the load card feature of btc-e (or any other site for that matter) Load once via IBAN to activate, then never use IBAN again. Bingo, awesomeness ensues.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:18:28
Throw me a PM, I'll hit you up when it comes around &amp; hold you to it :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:54:37
I was there :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:24:11
Do not regret spending my bitcoin when I get to lazily walk around Montreal take in the sights, and enjoy 30+ minute firework shows wed/sat for the next couple weeks until I leave. That along with many other perks make it worth it 100x over.
No, what fun is money horded, share your wealth with the world &amp; the world will repay you healthily.

Yeah, I know it's kinda silly to say anon, someone is most likely watching &amp; I'm just oblivious :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:01:25
I would rather not answer this.
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:11:46
You should try and let me know how that works out for you. You grow a carrot out your ass &amp; I'll eat you hat &amp; the carrot along with it :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:21:29
I'm going to move back to montreal after I do some more traveling. I absolutely adore it here.
I spend it all over the place :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:14:11
Rented a place for 2 weeks with btc, traded a friend a btc funded flight for some cash for spending money, overall the experience was very pleasant, didn't stay in one place very long &amp; left like a week early from our accommodations to go exploring elsewhere. Overall it was a very rewarding experience.

I've yet to receive a tip, yet in the same haven't contributed anything super awesome. I'll just leave this here for adventure time fans:
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:22:13
I'm only here for a few more weeks, but send me your btc bud guy; that would be fun :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:30:40
I don't bring up bitcoin. I tell them I'm a writer, or that I own a business (both are true). I've gotten hastled a couple times, and just said I have enough money in "savings," to not be a drain on your system, and that I'm just coming to vacation. Been A-Okay so far ;)
My phone is incredibly locked down, and I'm not worried about any theft or mischief.
I'm sorry, that's a bummer. On my way into canada I got yelled at &amp; almost had to go to secondary. I literally just got off the flight, was incredibly jetlagged, and wasn't looking forward to the 2hr bus I also needed to take.  Customs lady took one look at me, asked me straight out with a booming voice "you're not coming to work here right, cause if you are, you're screwed." I just told her the truth &amp; I got in :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:19:24
:( sadly not many places accept btc in my travels. I have slim pickings, but take advantage when I can.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:55:33
I think I should have just posted to instead. Think it would have been more appropriate in the first place... hehe
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:00:02
Because I'm adding value into the network as a whole by using it instead of hording my coins for the "future," stop future-tripping guys. It's money, and for some, a nice chunk more than what you had in the first place. Take my advice with a grain of salt, but I've found much more value in spreading out this newly acquired vault of magic internet money, than hording it.

Paging to the moon guy!
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:19:18
1) I'm kinda rehashing that, it's important, but I'm fooling myself in saying it's anon. It's close, but someone is prolly still watching somewhere. I can mix coins, use only 1in/out per address, and be as careful as I want, but sometimes just a little slip and it all falls apart.
2) Because the only way bitcoin can &amp; will grow is with people like you and me actually using it.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:12:34
Privacy, I use cash for almost all my purchases, and it would be nice to be able to cash out btc a little easier.
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:01:07
I ordered a bunch of cards to a temporary address along on my travels, just carry them around with me.
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:10:33
Bitcoin is currency agnostic, I'm healthily using the system how it was designed until everyone accepts btc.
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:54:34
How would you care to receive your proof? I have a lease agreement, id's, a bunch of receipts, you name it I've got it around... I would prefer to keep my identity to myself, so send a mod my way.
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:06:25
Not that hard to mess up, and I included simple instructions, along with a web gui if you feel like an uber tard :) Let me know if you need any help, I would be happy to assist.

Most recently tried @ montreal poutine; but their internet was all globbed up &amp; I couldn't get a signal to make a payment. Other than that a few tiny lunch places in california and arizona.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:16:46
Because I'm just spending it, I feel like it all evens out 
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:00:38
Not really at all. I check the spot price to pay rent, don't follow btc price super close, cause when I go to spend I guess I just don't care what the fiat equivalent is, I just know I have a few coins to spend &amp; spend them.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:16:00
I'll think about it.
Montreal Poutine (decent smoked meat poutine, amazing outdoor terrace space)
@_date: 2014-07-16 08:23:54
Yes I do, unless I start working for btc :) 
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:38:59
Coinbase will be the easiest solution for your landlord. He could have an invoice setup for you to pay. Or just give you a payment button to pay each month. He will be able to have the option to hold bitcoin, or convert instantly to usd. Also you'll both get email notifications of payments sent (for accountability)
I currently pay my rent with btc &amp; my landlord accepts spot price. I just send him btc &amp; he does with it as he pleases. As long as I pay rent on time he doesn't care how I pay it.

1) Currently taking a vacation &amp; living off savings
2) Landlord accepts btc, have local btc -&gt; cash connections -&gt; backup iban debit -&gt; i.c.e credit card
3) At the moment I'm exchanging for CAD @ current exchange rate.
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:16:25
Initially finding a way to "cash out" without moving to a bank account. There aren't a ton of places that'll accept bitcoin, so I experimented with a few prepaid debit / credit / iban cards / misc other methods so that I could spend on a day to day basis (lunches, beers, tobacco, etc.) Once I figured that out it's been a breeze ever since.
Especially with amazing services like  &amp;  and  It's becoming easier and easier to seamlessly use bitcoin.

How long you staying there, maybe we can meetup; please check bitcointalk in the 'for sale,' section You'll find all about iban cards.
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:08:25
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:10:20
they've been around for a while; and yes, they do offer to import from a given address : 
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:59:20
Check bitcointalk for iban cards, you'll love um.
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:21:40
Ya, you got me...
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:07:21
Quick little tidbits:
1) Take 10 minutes &amp; search bitcointalk. I recommend Mateo (he is fantastic &amp; has provided me with amazing help, and is very professional / courteous)
2) Wait patiently for card to arrive
3) Load the card with like $2 or something measly over IBAN to activate the card (this is important, otherwise the next step doesn't work.
4) Use btc-e or another card loading option. (just another note, activate beforehand. It's easier, yet if you make the mistake of loading the card w/o activating first, don't worry, your money isn't gone) I've activated a card after loading it &amp; it was just fine...
*) Kinda a bummer the fee model you pay (5-7%), but the only other way to get around this is to buy giftcards, and you can't find giftcards for any of the bars where I live, so an IBAN card is the way to fly. :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:07:49
If you load via a card loading service the limit never goes up.

okay, seems like a lot of peeps want to know about this.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:31:28
Of course, that's where I need a LOT of help; building a curve, and being able to ween out the "cheaters," I know there'll be a fudge factor, and it's just a matter of working with the data, and knowing what to include / exclude.
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:30:22
I currently use a combination of paper wallets, and electrum. I used mycellium for a bit, but preferred to use electrum (even in it's ghetto state) on android, because it would sync with my other machines easily.
I seriously can't wait until the native electrum client comes out (*cough *cough)
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:59:22


I carry some fiat in a day to day experience (have to for metro &amp; just random shit). Plus I can't get an iban card in cad :( ; so I'm cheating a little bit by exchanging  w/ local people.


Nope, not at all


I do have other investments (roth ira, business holdings, couple dollars in a bank account... hehe)

I'd use it to hire a software developer to write a bitcoind application module for openwrt; so that I could release a simple always on bitcoin node router.

If anyone wants to start this game, donate $5 to me, I'll start a new reddit post &amp; lets see where the $5 ends up :)... hehe
@_date: 2015-09-19 07:47:37
We should just play a game of pay it forward. (x) user donates $5 to another user (y) ; then (y) gets to decide where the $5 goes (whether it be another user, donation to a good cause [we need more places to donate bitcoin to], anywhere but themselves); what would be neat is an ethereum contract that handles the exchange &amp; has some rules.
