Amd hasn't fallen nearly that much, it must be more the other bad bets.  But I am very sorry for you that that happened.  I am extremely bad at getting caught in a what if loop when things go wrong so I know it's not easy to 'just let it go.'

I missed that part on options.  Fully aware what they are.

I'm very sorry.  Do you happen to know what sleeping pill that was?

This would be a very interesting metric.

OK put another way, what are the total assets worth of the big miners?

I know he spoke about bcc and what it means to users when it was happening, but has he ever weighed in on his opinion of bcc, increased block sizes etc?

And how do they solve the issues OP is stating?

Doesn't a change in pow make it an altcoin as someone said earlier in this thread.

Easier said than done for some.  Like there's that guy that mined a lot of bitcoin and thought he had backed everything up and threw out the drive.  He went to the landfill hoping maybe they put aside electronics for recycling but nope.  When they were interviewing him he said he was devastated and I think I would be too.
It would be tough to say oh well, when you know your life would have been changed if you simply didn't throw out a hard drive.

What do you mean his people?  Say you had significant holdings and wanted to invest?  Why are there even buy limits in the first place on any exchange?

That would be a really cool story to read about.

Lightning, from what  I understand will be more or less centralized hubs, handling numerous smaller transactions off chain.

My concern is the fees.  I just went through the suggested sites from bitcoin.org and they all look like a ripoff in their fees.
Just for even numbers, let's day 1 BT was 3000 us right now.  And I know if fluctuates wildly, but let's day it was stable at 3000.  If I want to buy 1 BT, what's a reasonable amount in fees to obtain that 1 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:51:49
And where to not get ripped off in fees?

I know very little about bitcoin but read bits here and there over the years.  I even remember reading about it on sladhdot when it first launched.  Now even though he's never sold any, didn't it seem a little self serving to launch a cryptocurrency and already having mined a fair bit?
