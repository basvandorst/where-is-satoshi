We are not going to destroy or sell their BCash, if people still haven't withdrawn their BCash today from BL3P they can send us a message with their BL3P username and a BCash address and we will withdraw their BCash manually to the address the user wishes to use.
BL3P users will always have access to their money.
We are just not going to waste any more time supporting BCash on BL3P.

As explained in the puzzle explanation ( some subsequent puzzles require keywords from the previous puzzle to be solved. In this case, Christiaan Huygens (the solution to the first puzzle) was the keyword that you had to use for the cipher.

The first puzzle has been solved! Here are all words that are in the puzzle:
The remaining letters are: nicestarguyhashin
These letters can be used to form 'christiaan huygens', an anagram to nice star guy hashin.

This should give you a good idea of how to do it:

You do not necessarily need a tool to construct and submit the transaction, simply filling out the form with the solution and your bitcoin address will have the bitcoins sent to you. We manually constructed the p2sh outputs.

**The puzzle has been solved in 35 minutes! Winning transaction here:
The solution to the puzzle was a QR code, solving the puzzle works as follows. Each grid of four squares has a number, this number indicates the amount of black squares in that 2x2 grid. You can use this information to color squares black and solve the puzzle.

The x's is there to handle duplicate subsequent letters, as the way the playfair cipher encrypts text is not compatible with double letters like puZZles and firstT Two. Most explanations of the cipher cover this, removing the x's gives the intended answer.
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:26:11
The next two should be more doable for everyone.
The last one though... That will not be easy.
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:16:01
Being Dutch will not benefit anyone on the next four puzzles, we promise ;)
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:36:23
Spaces were indeed required. As two hundred thousand is written with spaces (we mixed the words to avoid lucky guesses/brute forcing). The url to this puzzle was  also without spaces, while the answer to the first puzzle was christiaan huygens.
We recognize that it could have been confusing. Therefore, we will be sending an additional 0.05 consolation prize to the first person who submitted twothousandhundred in any form.
Hopefully, this was you :)

We figured a google search for 'fairy translation dutch' wasn't too far-fetched. This puzzle was really about creative thinking, and having your mind click with the clues, rather than relying on specific knowledge.
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:14:31
This was how to arrive at the solution: 
1. Put the four OP codes in the order they would have in a standard transaction, this gives a txid.
2. Use the amount of btc sent in this transaction to assign a number to each dot in the grid.
3. Draw lines between each dot, using the provided numbers, this results in a tic tac toe/pigpen/freemason cipher (the dots indicate which letters in the cipher require a dot) (
4. Solve the cipher using the keyword 'incomputable' from the previous puzzle.
5. ?
6. Profit

The second puzzle has been solved in 15 minutes!
This puzzle was a cryptographic puzzle, the so called playfair cipher. How to solve the puzzle is explained here:  (and on a
dozen other cryptography websites).

Puzzle 3 will go live next Monday,
15:00 CET, for 0.2 BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:38:28
The contest is open to all, note that most solvers simply googled something along the lines of "puzzle pairs letters" and stumbled upon an explanation of the playfair cipher. The next puzzles should definitely be solvable by anyone, so try again later today!

The answers to the remaining three puzzles will be easily recognized as not requiring any spacing, so it should not be confusing again.

Verificatie en support gaan in het weekend op basis van best effort, wat in de praktijk neerkomt op verwerking binnen een uur of twee. De 1ct-overboeking komt in het weekend alleen direct binnen vanaf dezelfde bank, dus voor Rabobank is het wat lastiger (bij de andere grote banken hebben wij een rekening), maar daar zijn ook mogelijkheden voor.

Although we take great effort to keep our spread on Bitonic.nl as small as possible, it's inevitable that the costs are slightly higher than on a regular exchange. As a Belgian customer in particular, your costs are higher because of the fees we pay to Bancontact, our Dutch customers face lower fees. 
If you're looking for a platform with lower fees however, we can recommend taking a look at our exchange, [BL3P.eu]( where it's possible to buy and sell bitcoin. At just 0.2%, our fees are much lower than on most other exchanges.

[BL3P]( is a bitcoin exchange by [Bitonic]( the largest and oldest Bitcoin company in the Netherlands.
BL3P is the only bitcoin exchange based in the Netherlands and holds Dutch bank accounts to process EUR transactions.
Please give it a try and let us know what you think!
