I saw the same thing said 4 months ago when the price dropped to $840
And then again with all the other so-called 'dips' and 'buying opportunities'

Murbul is here to shill, not to provide information.

Hardly anyone bought Bitcoins at lower prices - you can see this by looking at exchange volume data.
Also, anyone who did buy at lower prices likely lost their costs, had them stolen (I.e. mtgox), or sold early.

Here's what I found in my research:
1. They haven't released any financial statements
2. They have no significant income streams I'm aware of ('promoting Bitcoin on TV' does not generate income)
3. They say they've had an expression of interest from just 100 people, which sounds incredibly dire for any kind of profitability, especially when you consider how much those stores they built and advertising must have cost
4. There are reports those involved in Neo&amp;Bee are not responding to inquiries and even reports that some of them have fled the country
I base my title on the above research.

Im sorry for your loss.
I know you bought in at high levels and are now facing losses of 25%-50%+
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:46:45
What are you mining with? Every miner I know of is mining at a loss
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:51:55
Where are these buyers you keep talking about? Because there's not enough buyers to keep the price up - the price is rapidly falling
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:04:45
The price decides the facts
The 65% drop since 4 months ago is the reality
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:10:51
No, I don't 'invest' in shitcoins or any of its associated enterprises
Im just holding you shills to account
Funny how Neo&amp;Bee received hundreds of up votes here, but now no one can explain what income they're supposed to be making or even what they actually do which generates income
Its just another Bitcoin pump n dump
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:53:54
What prices have you previously bought at?
I know you bought at $1241, $1200, $1100, $1000, $900, but what else?

Always sell in a downtrend
You never want to catch a falling knife
The best time to buy is when the prices start rising after the long sideways move. You'll lose some potential profits by doing this, but its minimal and its the most efficient way of making a right buy.

'The price is FUD'
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:14:24
Oh I remember you, you're that idiot who made blog posts saying you regretted your purchase and that Bitcoin was doomed to fail
Which shows that you made a gamble and got lucky
Do you know where any profits you make come from? Bitcoin doesn't print money, it comes from other gamblers. Its a pyramid scheme, because early adoptors have already cashed out millions, which means recent investors are guaranteed to lose money unless they can find new buyers. The market is already saturated though, andthe outlook on Bitcoin is extremely bearish, not only because the price is falling and its a failure, but also because altcoins are about to take over the reins.

What don't you just tell me yourself? Not just for my benefit, but for anyone reading who might be interested in the answers to these questions
If you're not informed yourself, then don't bother replying - let someone who is informed here reply

Actually this is a common misconception
What actually happens is that somebody says 'I'm selling' and the majority of others seeing that buy, thinking they're contrarian - problem is, the majority of people act thinking they're 'contrarians', which ends up having the opposite effect
Ever heard of the phrase 'never try to catch a falling knife'?
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:32:37
What do Neo&amp;Bee actually do, and how much net income are they expected to be making? And what will that income be coming from?
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:45:16
You do realize that ghash.io have tried to double spend before right?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:57:58
A 20%+ drop in just over a day isn't rapid? What the fuck are you smoking bro?
Keep buying it up bro, because the majority of people are selling, and its going to continue being that way until it reaches $100 or less, and then you can enjoy a sideways move for months/years

Houbi is trading at 3090 yuan, which is $497
That's a verifiable fact, so it makes no difference how old my account is
Are exchange prices FUD?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:03:09
Well why don't you answer my very reasonable questions? Not just for my benefit, but for the benefit of anyone reading.
What services do they offer?
What do they get their income from?
How much is their estimated net income, and where does that income come from exactly?
The fact that none of you have answered these questions suggests that Neo&amp;Bee is a scam
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:22:34
It was a pump n dump
Others here just promoted Neo&amp;Bee because they thought it would increase the price of their shitcoins
I mean what does Neo&amp;Bee actually do? They've had no previous experience doing anything, and when I asked people here, they said the service they're going to offer is to introduce people to shitcoins through a physical store. How does that make significant revenue, and what kind of idiot thinks that's a bright idea - do you really think people are interested in going to physical stores/help desks for Bitcoin?

No financial statements
CEO has gone silent for the past 11 days (spammed on his twitter every day before that)
Last major announcement from them said that they've attracted interested from just 100 people in Bitcoin
No information as to how they're going to make significant revenue, let alone a profit - I mean think about it, they've been buying these big new offices and expensive TV advertisements, but how big can the market for their services actually be, and how much profit can they get on margin from it?
