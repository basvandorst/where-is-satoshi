Pathetic article that is full of half truths and outright lies with conclusions that are questionable best.  Author is just trying to pump the price.
* Author states we don't know why the run up to $1,000 occurred.  That's a lie, it was Willy Bot. 
* Author states we know why this run up is happening.  That's a lie, there's 0 evidence of bitcoin being used for capital controls.
* Cites Chinese volume as evidence of his claims.  Doesn't even acknowledge 99% of Chinese volume is fake.


Yea ok, who are you trying to convince, us or yourself.

And yet, that doesn't matter at all.  From my perspective I purchase something, the merchant is paid, end of story.  If 150 million people buy something with Visa today 150 million merchants get paid.  If 150 million people buy something with bitcoin today, the network gets DDoSed, shits the bed, and a few thousand transactions might go through if you are lucky.

First you'd have to define what a user is.  If a user is defined as someone using bitcoin to purchase a good or a service, there are likely far less than 300k real bitcoiners.  For instance, BitPay processes just north of 500k transactions per year.  If you figure Coinbase does roughly the same and account for a few other minor players, that's 1.5 million retail transactions per year only.  This would allow 300k users 5 purchases per year.
