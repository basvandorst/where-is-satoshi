Losing a couple stock points =! Downfall
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:05:03
Are you going to back up your assumption or are you going to continue talking out of your ass? And it's completely possible to support bitcoin and realize how stupid of a move this is, no fanboy or employee(lol) goggles needed. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:28:50
"We didn't need Silk Road"
LMFAO. You don't actually believe this, right? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:44:54


You mean the bitcoin community turns on those who fuck over said community? Gee, I wonder why. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:56:18
That thumbnail gave me a hearty chuckle. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:10:24
And I'm not disagreeing with you 
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:05:45
Your classic and original joke did the same to mine!
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:47:35
But it's okay because look, we're standing up to the big bad corporation that hates bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:42:33


Where are you even getting that? The only topic even relating to pock.io is the one we're currently in at 769 up &amp; 202 down. But yeah, **totally** net negative.
You want evidence? The topic where people are voicing their disapproval is right here. You're the one who's claiming it's fanboys/employees, the burden of proof is on you. Even the comments that praise pock.io aren't even in the negative, so I'll ask again. Are you going to keep talking out of your ass or are you going to present evidence that supports your claims?
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:26:02
It's less about it being against Reddit's rules and more about no being a shitty human being and possibly fucking over a man who made it abundantly clear that he values his anonymity. Fuck newsweek
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:50:43
I don't actively hate the woman but I'm sure as hell not sympathizing with her. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:53:28


"Anyone who disagrees with this choice is a troll"
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:45:28
They've got plenty of choice. Just like consumers have the choice to buy from a different site and support a competitor. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:27:55


So you will continue. Got it.


lol, I'd far from call this outrage.


Right, no possible way people realize that this is a vapid move that will accomplish nothing. Nope, definitely employees/fanboys.


You do know that Reddit mucks up the up/downvotes to throw off bots right? 
Why is it so hard for you to believe that average bitcoin users don't agree with this decision because it's ultimately a pointless on?
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:50:50
Get out of here with your logic and rational thinking! 
I swear this fucking community sometimes man...
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:27:54
Can you please cite an example of the community turning on someone originally held a probitcoin stance and was turned on after they something negative about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:25:08
Well this sub has 200,000+ subscribers, so I'm going to go ahead and say yes. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:56:39
So you pretty much didn't read anything past the headline, huh?
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:57:29
They go by accounts but it's safe to say that it's highly improbable that the majority of those are Alts. Even then, There's always those who don't browse Reddit but still follow Bitcoin news. I'm confident in saying that we've surpassed the 10,000 mark a long time ago. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:56:10
SrGrafo sucks 
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:02:14
I don’t think that’s what they were fined, but what they earned for laundering the money. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:20:56
Because it's stupid and your post sucks. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:08:48
I don't think anyone is arguing the opposite. Unfortunately, there is a chance that the mentally ill person will have a weapon. If that's the case, I'd rather be armed and ready to defend myself. In a perfect world, guns would be unnecessary, but we don't live in a perfect world. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:41:56
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:21:43
I wonder if they eventually will. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:44:19


Yes because subduing dangerous wildlife is a task that is impossible for a gun. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:09:50
True, but banning weapons will not make the criminals give up theirs. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:19:30
2017 nibbas be like 
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:13:34
Well yeah. You already did one. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:39:29
“Virtually all” means “most”
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:09:13
"Everything will be okay guys. I swear”
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:53:35
There's a very good chance bitcoin would've seriously stalled or outright failed without Silkroad. The negative connotations it gave bitcoin were worth the explosion in popularity and spending power bitcoin desperately needed in its infancy. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:39:09


@_date: 2018-11-24 05:27:48
Because he's talking out of his ass lmao 
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:58:24
He was arguably one of the biggest influences in early BTC adoption. Plus I think there are still a decent amount of coins the feds didn't find, so he still has some, albeit rather small, pull with crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:53:44
What’s the term? 
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:31:09
I can't really blame your girlfriend for making fun of you lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:51:07
You'd have a point if this was an actual post with decent information instead of a stupid fucking meme you fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:06:51




OH SHIT BOOM ROASTED!
nice job mate, def put that square in his place. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:21:46
This guy is a phony. A great big phony. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:57:27
I mean, making an announcement that a coin will be added in a month and then adding it two days later IS kinda unprofessional... 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:54:48
Why lol. 
Most people don't have a deep understanding of economics and the underlying functions of money, why would internet money be any different? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:42:39
Hope it crashes again tbh. Wanna buy more. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 05:36:56
I welcome him back. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:18:15
It’s not lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:43:30
Hopefully not. I love cheap BTC. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:39:08
Haha, the Feds don't give a single fuck about logic. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:27:03
Can we stop with this overused, dumb joke? It's not funny. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:08:12
Money isn't everything for some people. While I myself enjoy having and using it, if I run out or get it stolen I wouldn't really let it be the end of me. Money is valued differently depending entirely on the person. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:29:50
You seriously think the Feds would agree to a deal like that? They would honestly rather the coins be lost for eternity than see any "drug money" get spent, regardless of the cause. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:32:25
But now you've essentially blacklisted yourself from the vendor who use the greenlist. Furthermore, transferring coins from a registered address  -&gt; unregistered address that you own allow for people to connect the wallet to you. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:28:31
Mafia bosses and drug lords know the ins and outs of laundering money. DPR does not. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:27:50
He has to prove the money was obtained via legitimate means. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:06:00
Thank you for trying. I've always wondered if automod could be used to combat this kind of spam. Thanks for confirming it!
