I like the minimalistic feel to the widget. Can you make the widget show the bitcoin icon in grey? I have ETH displayed too. But the BTC icon from other widget is bright orange. Its so distracting.

Exactly my taught. Its no secret a small number of people are hoarding millions of BTC. Because the transactions are public. If these aren't distributed, its bad for the long run.

Wait, before we hate apple for removing bitcoin wallets from the app store, we should look at our own first. This subreddit blocks tipping of other cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. 
I don't own any other crypto but I think it's not right to block/downvote of any other cryptocurrency.

This is a scam

So i guess MtGox was holding the price up. Now we are done with that, market is correcting itself.

This is how it is. I'm not from the Us and my place doesn't have a bitcoin trading ATM or trade site. The localbitcoin wasn't reliable.
When I ask they are not noob friendly or outsider friendly. Even bitcoin trading sites are not for people outside US. We are forced to go to mtgox which is shirts now.
Their answer is always "look at FAQ". After starting, it's obvious how bitcoin works. But before I start, I had no one to ask. I can't buy. If I want to buy I had to spend thousands at localbitcoin. None of my friends, family or coworker knew about bitcoin.
Luckily,  I decided to just go ahead and try to trade using localbitcoin. This is after mtgox shut me down. Coinbase.com doesn't accept non US banks. 
I have hopes for bitcoin. I wish this community is a little bit more friendly to newbies.

You could do it Destiny

This is exactly what's happening on "Ahhhh you should read up the FAQ on the sidebar"

Listen to this guy.
tldr; google is considering it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:14:08
I cant access this website. Is it because I'm outside US?

You are saying that you sent money to a new/random address that isn't assigned to anyone? I'm kinda new to these. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:11:41
Can a foreigner register with a foreign address? Will there be a trading service? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:25:50
I was thinking maybe bitcoin is like gold and dogecoin is silver. Now silver is easier to go around because people are keeping their gold.

Why is this deleted? 500k USD? Thats like almost 3mil in my country :O

I was thinking about the same thing. I'm not entirely familiar with merchant accepting bitcoin. So I might setup an online page to accept bitcoin as donation first to familiarize myself first. 
These are my options:
As you can see, the first option is free which is perfect for donations with 0% fee. The 2nd option, Bitpay seems a little bit more professional with fees. 
Another option is mtgox.  
I think it changes your address every time you receive money. That way, its easier to track ticket sales i guess. Even if you change the receiving address say 100 times, the first address will still be yours. So far there is no limit for the address and no expiry. 
Finally, as the other guy mentioned, coinbase.

For those who didn't know, they did patent it last year.

I cant register coinbase from outside US.

Leave Gox. It will take you another few more months to withdraw.

I understand that miners verify the integrity of the ledger (mining). I read that blocks are released in 50's. How do they actually reward miners?
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:00:03
If everyone holds and invest, bitcoin won't be a currency. To really promote bitcoin, everyone should use bitcoin. Encourage merchants to adept bitcoin. Don't tell them to hold and wait for 2-4 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:47:26
Can someone give a summary on this?
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:54:49
Coinbase doesn't let certain countries ouside America to buy from them. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:25:52
What are the alternatives?
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:01:14
What exchange do u recommend? I dont know any exchange that allows you to exchange usd to btc from outside US.

I just opened an account at BFX. How do I deposit money to buy BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:07:51
Thank you. My country's rate is really bad. Nearly 900$ /BTC

It is possible to buy physical bitcoins with PayPal but it is otherwise difficult and/or expensive to do so for non-physical bitcoins, because of significant risk to the seller.
While it is possible to find an individual who wishes to sell Bitcoin to you via Paypal, (perhaps via  ) most exchanges do not allow funding through PayPal. This is due to repeated cases where someone pays for bitcoins with Paypal, receives their bitcoins, and then fraudulently complains to Paypal that they never received their purchase. PayPal often sides with the fraudulent buyer in this case, which means any seller needs to cover that risk with higher fees or refuse to accept PayPal altogether.
Buying Bitcoins from individuals this way is still possible, but requires the seller to have some trust that the buyer will not file a claim with PayPal to reverse the payment.
My mistake. I was looking for an automated site which i can sell or buy  quickly. MTGOX wants a bunch of documents which i provide to them and it has been &gt;2 weeks. I want a more efficient site.

Can you buy them?
