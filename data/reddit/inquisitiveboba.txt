First of all I suggest you force people to look at the bitcoin seed phrase created at launch and then after taking it away make them list the words in order before they can access the software. 
After you are in id suggest having a big ass this is how you sell btc or buy btc with fiat step 1, step 2, step 3 because that is likely to be the most common thing people use this for. If people gotta click more then twice to find an example then its to much. 
Id suggest modeling the UI more similar to coinbase, yes I know people hate coinbase but the UI they have is pretty decent. At the very least ditch the green and replace it with blue. 
Also ditch the BSQ token entirely

It matters for wall street and wall street getting in will really open peoples eye.

just clicking that link will hack your ledger, you have been warned

maybe brock pierce will come save the day

When I first got into this bitcoin stuff I really liked coinbase, but now I know. Not my keys not my bitcoin. Don't give anyone access to your money unless you are willing to lose it all.
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:05:51
like this. "sats"
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:09:57
How long until someone makes a custodial wallet for the purpose of faking their own dead in India and just taking all the BTC. 
A lot easier then making a hoax exchange probably. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 15:07:42
Yeah not the smartest tweet, if you have stable money, limited government and freedom you should never lose power like this unless some kinda disaster would happen. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 16:33:49

That's what ill tell all the people I scam after gaining trust for my experimental custodial lightning wallet. Wallet of Scamtoshi everyone! Is now in development. Please look forward to beta release. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:57:43
Should you really be lifting the 1.6 btc cap? 
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:06:47
yeah and lightning network incentivizes full nodes so it should balance itself out
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:25:52
Not your keys not your coins. That BTC now belongs to local bitcoins and you can't do nothing about it.

@_date: 2019-03-12 04:11:38
that is the point
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:11:19
That is virtually impossible.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:17:15
I have to agree, I don't think he missed the fact people treat it as a get rich quick scheme, that is one of his main reasons why it won't last. The roller coast has a lot more life in it I believe.
The main thing is the volatility, will people actually want to get paid in bitcoin for doing work? Well during a bullrun yes but in a bear market, probably not.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:25:02
Lightning is pretty crap right now, maybe better in the future. Honestly tho I think ethereum would work better as a second layer/side chain solution of bitcoin for daily small transactions. 
Just have a smart contract that pegs btc 1 to 1 with an erc20 and you are good to go.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:09:24
But bitcoin doesn't evolve, that is the point. The protocol hasn't been hard forked so it still the same.
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:52:04
not sure i agree with easy to identify

Put the post on the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:51:39
we already know there is 1 asshole that put 250k into bitcoin and isn't going to take part in proof of keys, lets put these scam exchanges out of business guys.
@_date: 2019-03-24 23:58:22
Custodial Wallets are not a solution but rather a problem that needs to be fixed sooner rather then later. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 11:07:49
but bitcoin hit $3100 in 2018

thats wack
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:13:41
Even if its tax money from amazon, give people free money they are gonna spend it, artificial demand, supply stays the same or goes down slightly cause few people stop working. 
Prices go up, including bitcoin prices. People see that prices go up so they spend faster causing the price to go up even faster. Hyper inflation.

Yes but Satoshi was very impartial and was only around long enough to make sure the system was working from the design of blockchain itself. He didn't tell people how they should use it or what his political beliefs should be when using it. By the time it was trading for fiat Satoshi was gone and thus bitcoin was able to become its own thing without a centralizing voice or face. 
You can put a face and political opinion behind every other coin, also bitcoin is the only one to show censorship resistances. Ethereum has already failed the test from the DAO censorship and everything else was pretty much made in bad faith with the motivation being profit from the beginning.

dog they don't own you anything

sounds complex
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:59:10
are we making a difference

not sure i agree with liquid adding privacy being that it has a trust aspect involved, if it was illegal then people would riot

He seems to only have the top level of understanding which is more then most but he doesn't get that this system removes the need for trust by working at scale. He doesn't get that this is absolute it's not an illusion, bitcoin at its very core is trustless and there is no way around it.
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:20:57
lol a roll back, does this man know where he is, this isn't bcash
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:49:40
its easier to store bitcoins safely offline then it is to setup a bank account

Boy I hope we get better non custodial LN wallets before this happens. This is when we gotta make it dumb ass proof for mainstream adoption to take place and to see banks fade away.
We are already seeing new middlemen in the form of custodial LN wallets which will eventually lead to people losing money they thought they owned.

ill respect adam on this matter when he does a full audit of tethers reserves for us
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:52:26
Can't say it enough it seems, how someone has 100k and still don't get hardware wallets is far beyond me. Im glad he lost his money tbh, not your keys not your coins. Just because you had access to it doesn't make it yours. You lost your coins the second you decided to leave them on coinbase, not when you sim swapped.

I don't understand, why do we need a trusted third party to process payments when we have lightning and the blockchain itself? 
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:46:03
Time to start memorizing my seed phrase huh
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:05:25
It might not get a lot of traction but if we make this a tradition it would be a good way to keep people level headed and remember what bitcoin is all about. 
Over the years this could become many people take part in and prove to the world bitcoin is sound money.

this if from summer 2017, she said it wasn't a bubble

bart charts 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:06:00
we need to turn this into a hashtag   get them trending

I wonder if Satoshi watched this. He could still be alive, maybe.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:11:15
Tbh from the pictures those pizzas looked pretty damn good. Idk about 800 million good but damn.

I don't think paper will do the job when the banks need another bail out. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:54:50
Also a decentralized exchange has no single point of failure 
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:04:27
Not your keys not your bitcoin, nothing you can do but comply with them. Buy a hardware wallet and move your money over after verification.

We don't need to ask them to make a video, given enough time they will see how wrong they are and make the video on their own accord. Honestly they probably just wanna wait for the peak of the next bubble so the video brings in all the views and I don't blame them one bit.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:13:52
not true
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:40:27
And they would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:18:26
it wouldn't use this, might seem like a nice tool now but I bet some hacker will find a way to use this to their advantage 
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:39:57
should of just used that money to buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:00:15
I wonder if that guy ever bought any bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:29:20
How about we just let bitcoin be bitcoin and if we need something faster, well we have litecoin and other alts like nano and even bitcoin cash. The free market will decide what to use for which purpose and we know that decentralization will always be king so to that I say good luck bitcoin cash, you're gonna need it.
