LBC is your best bet at the moment, really.
@_date: 2014-06-19 09:47:22
Care for scammers?? Why? Wtf?? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:04:43
Yay great job guys! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:16:50
If and when I get a nice car I'd get a "THX BTC" plate. Nice ride dude. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 00:33:14
This is disgusting. Thanks for the heads up OP for those who may not be fully aware. It can get even the best of us at times.
@_date: 2014-08-22 07:07:00
This worked, thank you so much. This has been frustrating me for weeks. They should really remove the "Continue" button then if it auto submits.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:20:09
Wow if this is true I can't wait to withdraw my 3.2 or so btc and buy doge with it. Please be true! 
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:26:02
Sure, got interac? lol
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:21:22
This is much more cost effective method. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:42:00
I started using Circle for smaller BTC buys recently. Being able to use my Visa credit and debit cards to buy BTC and then instantly be able to deposit them in my wallet is a godsend. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:41:04
I guess tipping thousands of investors' dollars out to random people in the dogecoin community was not a successful marketing strategy!
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:32:31
Happened to me a few months ago. Losing your wallet is definitely one of the most inconvenient things ever. Chances of getting it back are slim but you have to go through with all the processes of getting new IDs, new bank cards, credit cards, health cards, etc..
At least you did not lose your BTC :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:14:22
It's only a matter of time until big names like Walmart, BestBuy, EBGames/Gamestop, Costco, and Steam/Valve start accepting Bitcoin as a payment method. I would not doubt it if some of these names start integrating BTC in 2015.

I use Google dns, should I be worried? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:39:41
No, that is fine, but these are all just facts. For some people, this is a source of income or a hobby that makes a little bit of cash on the side, and I totally understand. My statement is simply me acknowledging the current state of things and knowing that the current trend will likely continue for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:34:59
Remember to use promo code "bitcoindealca" when checking out to get the discount. I just bought a $500 monitor for basically $350. FUCKING AWESOME!!!
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:21:59
Do they accept btc in Canada or is it just in the US currently? Would love to pick up a new 27inch ultrasharp. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:22:33
Circle is setting a prime example showing exactly how easily it is to send funds from one place to another, anywhere with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:23:38
Fucking awesome, just when I was going to buy some new parts. Going to grab a 144hz 3D monitor (the BenQ one) and a GTX 770, and a few other things. So happy a retailer is actually offering an incentive for their customers to use Bitcoin, albeit for a limited time. STILL A GENEROUS DISCOUNT!
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:46:42
Signed up with the a few weeks ago paid with btc. Activation was pretty much instant after paying the invoice. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 00:28:10
This is surprising considering how rampant paypal related chargebacks occur within those types of communities. It's likely fiverr did little to nothing in educating or incentivizing their buyers and sellers in using bitcoin on their marketplace.
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:02:44
It's too bad that most people mining bitcoin don't actually care about cryptocurrency at all, they're just in it for the money, period.
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:09:46
It's awesome to be able to use bitcoin for real world goods and services. I recently just spent 6 btc at Newegg Canada for parts to build a new rig for myself and my parents each. It is so much easier and reassuring using bitcoin to pay for things online. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:21:52
rofl genesis-mining, funny indeed. what a joke
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:32:08
Is this a fast car

If it were to break him then yes, he would just run away and not be a man of his word. If it didn't break him it would be a lot less likely that he would run away. Unless reddit can dig up some dirt on this guy and somehow expose him, he doesn't have much other than his reddit account/reputation to lose. And if he did the math right, he probably decided 25.47 BTC or even 2.547 BTC is worth more than his reddit account.
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:02:21
Almost $1100 CAD :D
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:33:04
I think you went full retard with this thread
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:37:51
Ooohh! I member! 
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:26:22
scumbags like roger ver really needs to fuck off already
@_date: 2015-07-02 10:37:16
I can respect this. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:09:48
Price will likely fall shortly after segwit is activated 
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:29:09
Wow, the dude lost a lot of weight over the past few years.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:13:43
Just wait. Today has been a bad day for the Bitcoin network. It may take up to 12 hours for your confirmation to start showing 
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:00:50
Yes this is terrible for any business or gaming site that relies on fast confirming transactions. I am also having similar problems with my customers today who made deposits and payments to me, as well as payouts/withdraws. Most people will automatically assume it's a problem on our end so we are dealing with a huge spike in customer support tickets all day, and earlier in this week :(
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:09:55
I buy weed and PC parts. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:03:48
I think it has something to do with the UTX build up today. I use coinbase for one of my businesses and payments outgoing are being stuck. No TXID is even shown, but I still think it's because of the UTX problem.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:09:45
This is indeed embarassing. It's very shocking to me that bitcoin is still at it's all time highs while this whole debacle is going on. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 10:33:31
I'm so jealous
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:48:01
This wouldn't be very interesting considering how close we already are to 2k
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:44:43
you make a very good point sir, thanks for widening my perspective.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:24:37
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:27:09
Yeah NameCheap has been my favorite domain registrar ever since. But even before they offered Bitcoin as a payment method I still preferred them over others like GoDaddy.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:27:25
How much would a fiat currency such as USD need to depreciate for bitcoin to be worth something like $10k or even $100k per coin?
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:15:57
My favorite character from one of my favorite comedies of all time. I actually thought this was a pretty cool moment in the movie :D
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:05:49
Unfortunately true 
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:29:46
The last batch is being shipped on July 2nd, but yes, if you order now it won't be shipped until September
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:48:00
Depends how many inputs there are in the transaction. The more inputs usually higher the fee,assuming you want it to confirm as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:28:21
