Too bad it wasn’t EOS, you could take this to arbitration.

I completely agree with you that it’s more likely to go bust then to succeed. And I agree with you that it isn’t a scam. I actually agree with most of what you said. But I don’t think you can blame EOS for raising so much money. They presented their blue print and people bought into it. So far B1 and EOS are delivering on on the technology they promised so I’m not sure how they’ve taken advantage of people? Larimer has built successful blockchains so I see the obvious logic of thinking he’d be able to build EOS. I agree with blueprint but definitely not a blueprint on a napkin. It’s easy for you to argue because the numbers are always in the critics favor.

Except for the fact that B1 jointly with VCs has already committed 700 million towards EOS projects.  Time will tell.

Umm it takes a few days to launch and vote for block producers. So as I said before things are perfectly on schedule. Maybe you need to stop being so protective of your stash and share some of what you’re smoking with the rest of us.

My guess is they’ll have more to show for it in the next 6 months then ETH has produced in 3 years. People like you can only hope they siphon away the billions of dollars and the project collapses.
So when is the B1 disappearing act going to happen? 
I have a feeling you’re one of the people that’s called EOS a scam from inception. “Vaporware.”  And now platform and blockchain are launching and now they are siphoning millions with Mike Novogratz and Galaxy Digital. You can only wear the tin foil hat for so long.

Not sure ETH will have first mover advantage on a commercial scale. 
If we are being honest with ourselves we’ll admit  ethereum is flawed. All that mindshare and still months away from putting on another bandaid. Do you really honestly think if Vitalik could do it over he’d build Ethereum again? 
There was zero delay and platform release and mainnet launch. It’s perfectly on schedule. Excellent job of pretending to know what you’re talking about.  
Remind me in a year.

They made 4 billion to put towards moving the tech forward and supporting the building of game-changing dapps that will run on the smart-contract platform they built because no other platform can handle commercial grade dapps. Not sure how you can be upset at block one for raising 4 billion. The ico launched at like 50 cents a token and the open market did the rest. A lot of people have been calling EOS a scam since inception. Well it seems to me like EOS is delivering whether people approve of their methods or not. So now all that’s left is to accuse them of making too much money. They’ve already started dumping big chunks of money into launching funds to develop the tech. Not really what else is left to criticize?

Satoshi never mentions the word “blockchain” in his white paper. The whole idea of “don’t invest in crypto, invest in blockchain” is a corporate idea. The truth of the matter is a decentralized blockchain needs a native currency to function while a private blockchain needs no native currency to function.

That’s exactly what I thought when I initially saw this.

Obvious reverse psychology. Obviously.
