can confirm, have listened.
great show. I learned about bitcoin from them back in like 2011. oh how I wish I would have bought in back then.

lol that's a great idea...
from my experience.. there's no fee's involved .. at least none that I've seen
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:44:35
potentially, but I don't know that guy and how would he know I have a blockchain wallet?
feels more targeted than coincidence..
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:13:39
LOL.. I'll try that next time

Quick backstory: found an email in my spam folder saying someone tried to access my Blockchain.info account. I then noticed the email was from a  email address. Then looking at the email details, it mentioned fwd.facebook.com, which reminded me of an email saying how my FB emails will be forwarded to my gmail.
So I think the person who attempted to phish me, somehow came across me through my facebook profile and knowing facebook forwards the  emails to your real email account, thought they can trick me into clicking the link.
Anyone seen anything like this?

I agree... so this is a warning.. don't put "bitcoin" in the memo.. and they won't know.
so strange.
I also looked thru the Terms of Service and couldn't find what this transaction was in violation of. it could also be cause I don't speak legalese..

because this is meant to be funny... not an accurate depiction
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:41:48
awesome! i'll check it out
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:33:57
funny thing is.. I only use Chrome...
I have Firefox as a backup/for troubleshooting websites.
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:02:27
it has no nickname and the email came from a guy with a comcast email.. not a blockchain email.
also the link is to goo.gl link shortener.
I am very tempted to click on it.. just to see where it takes me to.
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:38:06
they can try, but will it work?
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:06:12
ok just clicked it....
takes you to blocklchains.info... 
block **l** chain **s**. info
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:29:37
easier said than done..

according to Free Talk Live, there's already 1500 movers in NH.
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:09:45
I opened a Firefox in private mode and it took me to a blocklchains.info domain
also, the page never loaded.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:22:18
oh wow.. thanks man... never heard of corgicoin... is there an android wallet available?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:31:25

you haven't dove in yet because of potential phishing attempts?
does that mean you don't have any credit cards either?
with bitcoin, you can store your bitcoins offline, so as long as you don't give out your private keys, then you're pretty damn safe. blockchain.info is an online wallet, so it's less secure, but you shouldn't keep all your bitcoin in an online wallet.

according to the indictment, DPR used a wire transfer to pay the hitman.... a wire transfer... and not bitcoin... really?
makes no sense..
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:27:25
yes it is.
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:38:54
I say just install the official bitcoin wallet and check it out. maybe even purchase like $5 worth of bitcoin and play with it.
or you can even try Dogecoin... get a Dogecoin wallet, get the  app, play a few games, earn free Dogecoin... then "cash out" and send it to your Dogecoin wallet.. just so you can get a feel of how cryptocurrency works.. you don't have much to lose.
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:46:29
it was on the blockchain...
@_date: 2014-09-16 07:32:29
that's good. I'm working on paying off my debt, so I too can be debt free one day.
yeah there's so many options for bitcoin. you can print a paper wallet whete you basically print your private keys as a QR Code, put it in a safe, and then send bitcoins to it and no one will ever have access to them, unless they get in that safe.
crazy stuff you can do with bitcoin... and it's all under your control... no bank or government can touch it (unless you give them your passwords/private keys).

I'm not sure if I understand. send what as a picture or truecrypt container?
my buddy sent me $20 thru Google wallet.. and I sent him BTC to his wallet. that's all that occurred here.

problem is, the money is in USD.. cash.. not in a bank.
