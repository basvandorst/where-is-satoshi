Hmm it didn't reply but I see the exchange in my wallet. Does it reply when the transfer clears?

let's do it

Aha I see! Thanks so much!

ok awesome. and since the extension is sandboxed... it means that i don't have real access to the "private" address because the extension itself is the private key. right? sorry for all the questions!
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:39:44
hmm yes.. i know some of those words. 
haha but seriously thank you very much for answering my questions! I'm in a vague area of understanding *how* to do some stuff, but without the full knowledge of how it works. gotta read more. 
thanks again!

so I've never used bitcoins before but have been reading the wiki all day. 
to my understanding.. if i install this without first getting a wallet, the extension itself becomes a kind of wallet. so for example if someone sends money to me right now using that address (in the receive tab), the extension wallet stores the value, then i am able to transfer that value into a wallet i make later? 
which is why i can just keep generating new receive addresses?
how incorrect is that description? 
also i've read the starting guide and am about to settle into all this and then i realized.. i have no idea how to *get* money into a wallet to begin with. how to send it? seems simple. how to have some?

wait one more question!  
are those addresses one time use? on the faq it said that each address is one time only. so what about the 
pay with BTC" button on some sites? do they generate a new key each time someone presses them&gt;
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:48:08
but even if it's sandboxed it gets added and works with the bitchain? 
like i hit generate: 13E8vSQFxWiFNJ8pvgdBxNsVoZcJ956dAz     
i hit it again: 1H6QzPG2mW2Q4pzQYpGdX9GELujJAUR22S       
one more time: 1PgfWLPjj6fa4mtWGJwvYLZzv7vsrt3MNe    
which one works? only the newest one? all of them? none of them because there was no transaction?   
also, with a full features wallet, how do you *get* money into it?
