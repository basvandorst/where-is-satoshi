can i haz cheeseburger?

Big enough? For sure. The Mt.Gox trustee is giving Mark and I so much money that we're moving into an even bigger penthouse. Dogecoins are for noobs. Mark coded the website. Blame him. Cat in space? Nah, I prefer my current cat penthouse. Cat Fancy subscribers should create MeowCoins.   
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:29:26
The cat playhouse is being foreclosed upon for being goxxed. Japanese dogs and cats love sushi and have asian eyes. Next cat-info-tainment will be getting my MeowMix back from Mark.   
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:17:56
thank you, sir.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:20:18
That is true. Brock is there with me.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:25:51
oh I wasn't the one who made this thread. I find it amusing actually since someone else noticed this. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:07:16
aww thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:29:31
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:18:01
Because I drag my cat balls all over it first, and then let him type on it.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:18:28
na na na na na na CAT MAN.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:23:16
I'll be waiting for it. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 02:07:58
Good question. It's a tough call. I'm pretty optimistic about it...but sometimes it feels like it is just too advanced for the average people to use in a day-to-day basis. I still have my hopes for it and believe either it will become a mainstream way of making purchases, or slowly die out and become a toy for geeks. Hard to say at this point, but it will be an interesting next couple years. We'll have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:23:40
meow :P
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:22:22
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:18:41
pump and dump.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:30:41
Nope, it is not. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:17:01
Damn, you caught me. It really does feel that way sometimes. Who knows by who though.

@_date: 2014-05-27 19:16:01
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:47:34
Yes, I do, actually. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:28:34
Made the account for the AMA.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:49:54
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:25:11
Sure, why not. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:24:07
Yes, yes I am. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:51:07
No, I am not, but he might find this funny. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:32:15
Hello brother. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:18:49
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:19:04
How do you know I'm not?
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:11:43
I never took any coins, but I sure did lose some in the whole mess. Even my cat-food got goxxed. Mark and I don't keep in touch much anymore. He won't give me the MeowMix he owes me.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:46:08
Meow. Yes, that really is me. I'll do an Ask Meow Anything if people still want. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:49:03
Yes, my condo is better than yours. Bitch. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:25:46
No, I didn't. I wish I knew where they are. I lost a lot of Friskies in that apocalypse.  
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:51:25
You and meow both. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:31:37
Thanks for the shelter. I might need it. I think they kicked me out because they are full of shit.  
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:48:47
They took me off unfortunately. I was on there until someone noticed and it hit the front page of Reddit. They asked me to change it via their 'joke names bylaws' - I asked them to show me the statement in their bylaws. They never replied back, and removed my account. Didn't refund me either. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:17:10
Mark ran out of cat-food, so I ate the private keys :(
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:24:25
somewhere in the middle. peak is soon.
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:06:52
Indeed it was removed. I guess I should ask for a refund now. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:24:09
Don't bring back the nightmares. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:15:40
If I was I couldn't tell you. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:05:27
Why not? It was for AMA purposes. It's my Foundation account anyways. (Which they also suspended as of a few hours ago actually. Still got the forum access but I can't access the topics. So they basically stole 0.06 BTC from me.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:49:41
He buys me lots of catfood. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:08:42
@_date: 2014-10-31 01:57:19
He will be terminated immediately. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:30:19
yes, yes it is.
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:29:53
sometimes. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:06:43
I am actually... PM me their details :) 
@_date: 2015-08-28 07:11:04
LOL, I could buy 40 grand worth of dogshit and it will look better than that website. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 09:07:59
I do, actually ;) 
@_date: 2015-04-19 06:43:17
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:36:00
When will I get my goxBTC back?

MTGOX 2015 LEAK. We held back. The 25th is coming. People need this. Fuck Mark. He has all the bitcoins. He is lying. We tried to get them. Very very close. Server went offline with the coins. Little hope left. Now we post. Download. Mirror. Torrent. Please. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:49:36
true. removed that one.
