Investing is about efficient reallocation of capital. Investing in Bitcoin is 'gambling', bonds not so much.

Well, until someone crashes the bike or steals it

Economies (and many other financial things) grow exponentially so to evaluate relative differences through time you need to remove that exponential effect, which you do by taking logs

No it isn't. Gambling doesn't generate any value - if me and you bet on a football match, the outcome is just someone is going to have a bit of someone elses money. The winner will be happy with this, but it's zero-sum (the loser being rather upset).
Investing on the other hand, creates value. Imagine a company looking to issue some debt so they can expand, say $1m. If you can find 1,000 people who have a spare $1k lying around in their account (generating close to no interest), they could invest it and gain a larger return when the company repays the debt with interest. The reason the company can repay with interest is because the profit/revenue growth resulting from the expansion is greater than the loan (also default risks). Company gets bigger and makes more money, each of the investors gets some extra money for helping make that happen. That's investing.
I'm not saying the difference between an investment and gambling is that investing is risk-free, I'm saying that investments have actual economic utility.

Chart is per capita so accounts for population growth - not that this post isn't absolute nonsense

Dot-Com crash had huge amounts of institutional money involved, no pension plans will be investing in cryptocurrency. Even if the bubbles are thematically similar, expecting the monetary values involved to be comparable is ridiculous.

I know how they work - just commenting on the thread, OP asks if Bitcoin had contributed anything, etnoatno said that it had popularized blockchain tech, I was asking if that was Bitcoin's greatest success then it seems like its value is done.

So we can retire Bitcoin then and move on with other blockchain tech?
