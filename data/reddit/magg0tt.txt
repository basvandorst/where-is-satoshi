The hardware cost is really quite reasonable, if you consider how much more the operator will have to pay to obtain the legal right to make a business out of it. Compliance will cost around $25,000 minimum, and likely much more. The Skyhoook project is making something similar, and shooting for a $1,000 price point, but they too have to address the murky waters of KYC and AML regulations, on which Charlie Shrem is being crucified over.  You can't forget about the enormous risk being assumed by the pioneers of this industry.  It is dangerous to challenge powerful interests.  I predict these kind of machines are likely to succeed in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa before they will show up in the U.S.

This is sad.  I won't be able to operate my Lamassu machine in the U.S. under current regulatory conditions, so I was thinking about Panama as a possible relocation target.  Your story makes a great case for bitcoin, but not for a simple, anonymous automated exchange machine, since I'd be the one ending up with all of those $50 and $100 bills and would have to endure the same ordeal when depositing them.  
Thanks for destroying my dream of a Panamanian holiday!

They already use multi-sig. Problem has nothing to do with multi-sig.

Never had a problem with it myself.  I generally use Linux as my OS, so rarely ever worry about Windows malware, but I have also visited the site on Win 7 and Win 8.1, and had no issues.

Thanks for putting this together! I might be able to get a couple of us from the Bay Area to go to the game next week. Since  you apparently have good connections with the Kings organization, do you think they might be interested in having a bitcoin vending machine installed at the Sleep Train Arena to help their fans buy and use BTC? I have a Lamassu machine that needs to find a good home, and this seems like a perfect market and location.

I'm now checking [Cointelegraph]( more frequently than CoinDesk, but am often annoyed by some of the poor writing and editing. I assume a lot of their writers are non-english speakers, which might explain the many typos and awkward grammar I see in their stories. Still, I like how they cover issues that are sometimes ignored by Coindesk.

I donate bitcoin to the Seasteading Institute ( on a monthly basis.  I also bought lunch at the Plug and Play Tech Center with bitcoin last week, and have bought sushi with bitcoin at Sake Zone in San Francisco.

Mt. Gox , and its competitors are the problem.  Large centralized operations are the antithesis of the distributed peer to peer model that is the backbone of the system.  Small autonomous ATM machines are the solution.  If they become ubiquitous, it won't be any more difficult to get bitcoins than it is to buy a soda or bag of chips, or a RedBox DVD from a vending machine in the store. And if the operator of one machine fails, he doesn't take anyone else's bitcoins with him and the entire network doesn't quake with anxiety.  I doubt there'd even be any headlines about it in a newspaper.
Bitcoin is not like the Federal Reserve system.  No one is too big to fail, no one expects any bailout and, to the media's great surprise and disappointment, the demand for bitcoins wasn't hurt all that much when Mt. Gox imploded.  The market behaved exactly as free markets are supposed to behave.  Bad operators fail, innovative new competitors spring up from the ashes.  We don't need any central points of failure anymore, and having hundreds or thousands of smaller independent operators exchanging fiat for btc in cities worldwide will make the network much stronger and widespread adoption more likely.
I'm a Lamassu customer with an enormous regulatory challenge ahead of me if I'm going to do anything with this amazing technology.  My options are limited and my resources minimal.  
Can anyone get me a meeting with Patrick Byrne or Vivek Ranadive, two brave bitcoin cheerleaders who might want to help a brother out?  Email contacts or phone numbers would be greatly appreciated.

How tiny? You know there are bitcoin [faucets]( all [over]( the [place]( where you can earn [millibits]( simply by solving captchas. No need to buy anything, and there's no risk, but it takes time for the payouts to add up. Still it's a lot easier (and less expensive) than investing in mining equipment.

So sorry to hear about your troubles. Makes me glad I didn't order from Robocoin. I operate a Lamassu machine, and have no complaints at all about them. They shipped on time and while the original software that came embedded in the device was not very flexible or easy to configure (remote flash update was the only option), the new software build works fine and they stepped me through the entire upgrade process. 
The Lamassu worked fine right from the start and it only cost $5,000. Since I purchased in December, I only paid 5BTC for my unit. I'm very happy with the Lamassu and only wish I could land a merchant to host it. I've had interest from a number of different businesses, but they aren't familiar with cryptocurrencies and don't have enough enthusiasm for the technology to take a chance at this early stage.

Almost all these new players in the ASIC market are way behind their published shipping schedules.  CoinTerra is no exception. None of them have shipped on time. Seems the only one with a 28nm product in the hands of their customers is KNC.  
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:37:12
Thanks for turning your misfortune into a WIN for customers! As I mentioned in the comments on your earlier post, I'm a very happy [Lamassu]( customer and would strongly recommend their machine over the Robocoin device for anyone interested in operating a bitcoin teller machine/kiosk.

I shared it on fb, and think cheerleading for bitcoin is perfectly okay.  Our adversaries are so much more powerful, we have to make our point as strongly as possible when promoting this revolution.  I also endorse the Arise Bitcoin billboard campaign, which inadvertently purchased display space in some of the poorest and most blighted neighborhoods in the bay area, just because these had the lowest rates.  This is just the target audience that NEEDS to know about bitcoin, because it represents a way out of our debt-based ghetto growth economy.

Not exactly true. I have set up a recurring (monthly) pledge payment on Coinbase to a non-profit after I became disgusted with PayPal. It was much easier to do on Coinbase than PayPal and is always timely and reliable.

I operate a Lamassu kiosk and while the manufacturer has recently developed software enhancements to comply with KYC/AML regulations, I have chosen not to implement them. Yeah, my ass is on the line here, but I've used the Robocoin machine and felt it was very intrusive. I like the idea of anonymity and I don't want to have to keep records of my customers' identities and monitor their private transactions. That's not Satoshi's way, nor is it mine. So far, I'm operating well under the radar and I'm not very worried about it (though some attorneys have warned me that I am taking a huge risk by following this path). I have a FinCen license, but there are no final state licensing regulations (yet), so until they tell me what I have to do to stay out of jail, I will continue to operate my machine as it was shipped, without collecting personal information from the users. The only "compliance" feature I've turned on so far is a maximum transaction limit of $500 USD. This is partly to avoid having to file Suspicious Activity Reports, but mainly to keep me from running out of bitcoins on a daily basis.

This is just a re-branded Robocoin machine. I believe there are three of them in California, but I've only used the one located in Mountain View at [Hackerdojo]( [Coindesk's ATM Map]( shows several more in southern California. There are also a couple of [BitAccess]( machines in San Francisco and Santa Monica, and there will be more coming soon.

I heard about it after the fact and grabbed a torrent to watch it.  The Good Wife holds the distinction of airing the first entire TV episode about BTC, but it is getting mentioned frequently on other shows (see "House of Cards" reference and the one on "Almost Human" last fall).  It's too bad though, that Almost Human episode had to link the bitcoin transaction to a crime, reinforcing the negative public image with which Hollywood wants to taint us.
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:24:07
Absolutely correct.  I'm a Lamassu customer, and while my device has yet to ship, I know others who have theirs in hand, and you can configure the fees in any way you wish, and use either a hot wallet or connection to an exchange.  I'm on the fence about this, because the experience that Robocoin had this week with Bitstamp makes me nervous about that option.
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:51:34
Agreed. I've been transferring funds from my credit union to Coinbase every payday and never had any problems.

I'm curious about your ATM and its capabilities. Is it a [Robocoin]( box that can perform 2-way transactions, but requires lots of personal info, handprint, ID, photo, user account creation)? Or is it a [Lamassu]( which only requires a QR code and cash? A [Skyhook]( [Bitaccess]( A [Genesis1]( I'm an operator in this market and am curious about the specific machine you've acquired and why you chose that model.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:53:32
$10K is the threshhold that triggers a Suspicious Activity Report. Coinbase is required to file an SAR for all transactions of that size or larger. It is a very long and detailed report that goes directly to FinCEN and your state's financial services regulatory office. Banks don't like to see them and Coinbase doesn't like to file them, but they could be shut down instantly if they fail to do so.

Can we confirm (from a cryptographic signature) that the comment posted to Fran's blog is from the real Satoshi Nakamoto?  The grammar  doesn't seem to fit with his writing style, but if so, it would be only the second post he's made since he withdrew from the project. He last posted to the P2P Foundation in March 2014 after the Newsweek story to confirm that "I am not Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto." This was verified by a PGP signature.  The comment on Fran's blog doesn't include the signature, but if anything would prompt him to come out of retirement, I'm sure it would be to say some kind words to Fran on the passing of his friend.

Good luck with your venture! Wish I lived in Canada, where I might be able to operate my Lamassu vending machine.  Unfortunately, I'm in California, where I'm unable to install and legally operate any kind of business around it.  Working on deals with angels, but it's uncharted territory right now, and higher risk than many people are willing to take.

As I recall reading, the Robocoin machine starts at $20,000, and the fee ranges from 3% to 5% which is split between the operator and the Robocoin company (in exchange for hardware/software maintenance and support).  Even so, the Bitcoiniacs group which purchased and placed the one in the Vancouver coffeeshop, saw an ROI of 17 days.  It handled $100,000 Canadian transactions in its first week and $1 million in 29 days.  Impressive.

I posted about this in a different Reddit thread yesterday, where quite a few Scots were discussing the referendum. The economy and currency are huge issues in this decision, and the option to join the Eurozone or stay with the British Pound Sterling will make or break the independence movement. I meekly suggested that an Independent Scotland could adopt a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, or follow the example of Iceland and create their own cryptocurrency like [Auroracoin]( 
That's not a popular idea, as it turns out. According to the Scots, the most vocal proponents of independence tend to be senior citizens who don't particularly care for the Euro, but hate being a part of the UK. They don't feel at all comfortable with this new digital currency idea, and while the younger generation are cool with crypto, they aren't the movers and shakers pushing for independence.

Naming the island itself is, you know, kind of important. My favorite island in the Caribbean is St. Maarten, so that's the one I hope you're talking about, but I have one friend who lives on St. Croix who claims that paradise is the place to be (but it's one of the USVI, so bitcoin acceptance there would be rather sketchy). I have another friend who lives on Anguilla (BVI) so that could be a nice option. I've never visited Jamaica, but it is on my bucket list. 
But before I drop money on a lottery, I really want to know THE NAME OF THE ISLAND YOU'VE TARGETED FOR THIS EVENT.

Some kids are born geeks, and mining could fascinate them as it did me when I first got involved in bitcoin.  I think showing kids how mining works with a cheap USB Block Eruptor could be a nice class project, but I wouldn't devote a whole lot of time to it (especially since a Block Eruptor isn't likely to return the 1BTC cost of the merit badge in the student's entire career).  Doing a study comparing how different mining pools operate and analyzing the various statistics they display might be interesting to the same kind of kids who become interested in mining.
I think kids would also be amazed by sites like

I contacted the [distributor]( to see about hosting a screening for our bitconi meetup group. Basic costs are $250 per screening or 50% of boxoffice receipts, whichever is higher. I don't know how much of that goes back to the filmmakers, but I assume it is probably 20% or less.  Theatrical screenings are a great way to expand the audience for a small documentary like this, but are a pain in the ass to organize. The one upside is that the theater we have contacted is now interested in learning how to accept bitcoin payments at the boxoffice!

I use the Mycelium address book all the time. I regularly pay my bowling partner in BTC, and it is much easier to send payments to the address saved on my smartphone than scanning a QR code from his phone every week. I don't keep a very large balance on the phone, so I also transfer funds regularly between wallets. It's much easier to do this using the address book.

I know Butterfly Labs had a booth at the last CES, but don't know how many other BTC businesses bothered.  Ahaseeb, have you taken delivery of the machine and can demo it there?  I've pre-ordered one, but it won't be shipped until February, too late for CES.

I played around with one of these devices last spring and pre-ordered mine earlier this month.  Supposed to be shipping in February 2014. This is one of the easiest methods I've seen for newbies to buy their first bitcoins.  Looking forward to using it to introduce more people to the community.
