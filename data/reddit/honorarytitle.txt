Did we hit the floor? Maybe time to buy back up?

At this rate i have lost so much money not being able to invest in GBTC.

Yea same here! Apparently, the 401k to a rollover ira doesn’t count as your one rollover a year(irs guideline). You can technically transfer again if your not happy. I’m contemplating it myself, but want to see if i can buy tomorrow.

Thanks, Someone else mentioned the same thing. Zero communication happening on why it’s restricted. Such BS. I’m missing out on buying and will potentially lose gains now. It’s going to be over 2k by the time i move my brokerage account.

Agreed! I rolled my 401k into a IRRA and invested in it right away. I doubled my Retirement funds in two months, which is crazy. Anything from here up is just a bonus.

Where are you moving to? I plan on doing that this morning.

I’m hoping that is the case, but can’t get any information on it from the call center reps. 
Can anyone buy currently at their broker?

I was in at about 680 and sold at about 1750 this morning. Just bought back in again and gained a couple shares. Hoping i don’t regret that

Having the same issue with Merrill? I’m still blocked today

Honestly, GBTC is something you need to watch every day. Today for example, i went to a meeting and when i came back it was down like 15% and i sold. You need to keep an eye on it. Day trading, isn’t necessarily the case, but i have sold and repurchased about 3 times in the past two weeks.
Futures is a different monster, especially if you don’t know much about it. 
I would stick with investing in GBTC, set some limits for it to be safe (prevent losses, capitalize gains). I’m not with an institution that has futures and honestly I’m not going to bother trying to learn them.
