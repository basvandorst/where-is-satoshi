You are confused because you are trying to find logic and rationality in this sub.... a lost cause

Doesn't matter though, does it ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:08:36
bitcoin cash, coinbase, tether, memers, we have plenty of scapegoats
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:42:10
just crypto things ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:18:03
Hah, so either they both matter or neither does.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:15:54
10 minutes later: you meant 8.2k lol
