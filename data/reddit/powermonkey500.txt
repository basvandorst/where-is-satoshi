That doesn't mean it isn't a bubble. The housing bubble grew for around a decade before it popped.

If you have your addresses, you can pull all of your transactions. If not, yeah you'd have to try to track down one of those purchases and see if you could find your old address from that.

It was probably just a quip.

If I had to guess I would say it's going to spawn a z axis and go that way

One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that it also lets you lock in a price when purchasing using ACH transfers. 
I.e. you can "insta-buy" directly from your bank account, and they just don't release the BTC to you until the transaction clears. Meaning you get the price locked. With GDAX, you have to wait for the deposit to clear before you can spend that money. I use this on occasion to buy unexpected dips since I prefer not to keep too much cash on there.

Honestly... I'd recommend just cashing it out and buying with cash. Trying to pay with Bitcoin is likely more trouble than it's worth.

Because absolutely no reason
Haven't you heard, that's how we decide the future of Bitcoin value nowadays

Don't try to avoid taxes. You're gonna have a bad time.

Do you get the address mismatch?

Ugh, single digits per second. That's depressingly bad.

Why are people still using that garbage site?
