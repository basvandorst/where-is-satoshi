This is really useful advice and I'm really glad to see it. Thanks.
I'm working with a Scottish rehab clinic where we recently treated someone who was addicted to trading cryptos. We treat is as a gambling addiction:

All addictions are a problem.

And what impact is it having on your life?

Thanks for this comment. Would you mind if I quote you (anonymously of course) in my article. You explain the issue rather well.
I don't have a negative view about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies but I'm very interested in the addiction side of it.

What do you mean? You mean everyone's addicted or you and your partner/friend?

Thanks for this comment.
Do you have any links to "existing research on overlaps between day-traders and gambling addiction"
I'd like to find out more.

I'd like to know what happened? Did you get badly addicted or did you manage to move on? I'm looking for stories like this as I'm researching a story on addiction to cryptocurrencies for the Scottish rehab clinic I work for (Castle Craig Hospital)

Thanks a lot for sharing your story. How has it destroyed your life? 
Could I quote you in my article? I'll write for the blog at our rehab clinic. The clinic is called Castle Craig Hospital by the way and it's in Scotland. 
Where are you based?

That's a very interesting comment. Heavy drinkers often ask me if they're an alcoholic and I turn to the AA-type view which is that if the passion controls your life then it's an addiction. And an addiction is invariably negative. The other feature of addiction is that addicts invariably deny they have it, and become very defensive and very good at justifying their actions (and intentions). 
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:03:46
Can you tell me more about that? Why is it worse?
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:42:15
One problem is solves is micro transactions. With BTC you can pay a few cents for something without transaction charges, and if you look at banks they charge a lot for this and often have a 30 cent minimum charge. So, the problem is, I want to pay 5 cents for reading an online article but the bank adds a 30 cent commission. BTC provides the solution. Also, even if BTC doesn't survive the blockchaine technology answers another critical problem of how to secure online transactions so it will end up being adopted by the mainstream. The short term distraction is that the users seem obsessed with share prices, the regulators with controlling it and the press with finding one-off stories of crime that help them portray it as some sort of criminal conspiracy. As an objective outsider with no stake in this game (I'm researching an article into BTC addiction) I think it's here to stay.

What's worse?

Good point but I'm not sure there's any choice involved. I know that once yr addicted the element of choice is removed and you're on a one way train ride to hell. People say "just stop drinking. It's yr choice" but they can't understand that the alcoholic lost that element of choice when he/she crossed that line into addiction. The other feature of addiction is the fact that addicts are experts at denying they're addicts.

Why do you call it fake therapy and made up diseases?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:16:00
Great reply
Can I quote you?
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:54:51
Thanks for that very interesting comment. If it doesn't have a negative influence on your life it's not an addiction.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:52:47
That's a positive perspective but not one that's supported by similar addictions. Gambling addicts constantly run outta money and they do all sorts of nefarious things to get it. If the BTC trader can walk away he/she is not an addict.
