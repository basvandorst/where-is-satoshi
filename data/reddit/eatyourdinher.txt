Lmao...all I gotta say

what was the convo like in late 2017? she prob really wanted to get rid of it sometime during 15-20K

to some, it's just putting in a couple hundred and having fun..with that wild predictability being the source of entertainment
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:06:21
i mean...it’s a win win if you’re “supposed to” go at triple digits

would have to omit USD value in any language in the contract altogether. if you're paying "1 btc" then the contract should say "1 btc."

I understand people who DCA each paycheck they get, but I don't get people who say "can BTC stop soaring?? I'd like to buy more at my next paycheck!"
Why aren't you just buying it right now when you want to? If the case is you're strapped for cash at the moment, buying BTC seems like the least of your concerns.

Is it safe to sleep?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:41:31
you ok?

if it's something that interests you then think of it for now as a $200 hobby. i'm assuming you put it in because if you lose it, it'd be an afterthought. 
in any case, the right move is to just hold on to it and continue monitoring + doing your due dilgence research

at least now you know to not operate in the heat of the moment.

do you call it "crap" when it goes up 10% in a day? in the same vain, a drop like this is the same principle....but that's when you call it crap right?
i personally love how volatile it is. it's clear that this investing a decent sum in btc/crypto isn't for everyone.

tossed some more into the game at 13k price point..fuck it
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:01:10
what're the hard numbers? what'd you buy at to sell for that 9k price point?
can't imagine it's anything too bad.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:37:59
yep, feels good to actually have a lot of skin in the game this time around
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:21:04
why feel bad about taking out enough to solve these problems? if you have so much invested that you don't have access to solving your immediate situation, that's probably an issue. take that stake out and you'll still be in the game even if at a smaller scale.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:54:54
not quite..apparently
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:23:42
if your intentions are pure, you're a good man. it's just...we would think anyone naive enough to accept this is digging their own grave.
