Only if you want people to adopt Bitcoin. Luckily, most people don't give a shit about that joke of a "currency" where the people with the most Bitcoins are making money at everyone else's expense. Just one of the biggest fucking Ponzi schemes in the world.

I'll watch it when I get home. 
Just as an aside, I've yet to see any good reasons why Bitcoin will replace anything and I've been keeping up with news about it since just before it breached the $1/coin barrier but have been left utterly unimpressed. I don't see any reason for 99% of the world's population to bother converting their hard-earned cash into another supposed currency to buy anything when you can just buy products from sites like Amazon directly. In that respect, Bitcoin is trying to act like a middleman and that's why, in my opinion, it will fail. Maybe not in the next couple of years but in the near future sometime.
It'll be something used almost exclusively by tax dodgers and criminals at that point after attempts at general acceptance by the population fail, restrictions will be placed on the currency and then it will be killed off.

If you think that you're such a genius and think I'm wrong, tell me why. Leave silly attempts at sarcasm and stupid assumptions at school. Fact of the matter is that I gave a conclusion based on what I see Bitcoin as in its simplest form. Either give a valid counter argument or just stop talking to me.

I've been following it for years. I don't think people like you understand that Bitcoin is a joke that will never replace anything.

First, what makes you think I haven't? 
Second, "real dollars" are what makes the world go round. Bitcoin wants to be the middleman in such a process but most people see through it.

Just speculative nonsense. Bitcoin is rubbish and I wish the thing would die already. Those at the top of the pyramid are getting rich off idiots and I wish that people who recommend buying Bitcoins were jailed for the scammers they are. They're just salespeople for one of the lamest scams I've seen in recent times.
