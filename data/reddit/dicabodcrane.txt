While that may be true in hindsight, that's not what we were preaching back then. We were happy with our 10 minute global ledger back then. We were telling retailers that a tx propagates through the network instantly and the chances of a double spend were too small to concern themselves with for small purchases. 
Remember Bitcoin Boulevard in Ohio? Or when we loved Bitpay for sponsoring the Bitcoin Bowl and getting all those Tampa restaurants to accept Bitcoin for that week?
I'm not saying I don't support what is happening now, it's hard not to with the level of price appreciation we've had. I'm just saying that things were a bit different back when OP's bitcoin filter was added.

The question you must ask continuously ask yourself with Bitcoin or any other investment is: "If I had $(ItsValue) in cash in the bank right now, would I buy bitcoin with it?" 
The answer to that question should determine whether or not you hold or sell. That $11,500 is real, and any day you choose to hodl BTC is no different than using it's equivalent in cash to buy it that day. The idea of "Losses only become real when you cash out" is not correct. 
This holds true even when you are ahead. The whole idea of "house money" is a fallacy. There is no such thing as "house money", there is only YOUR money, and you are actively choosing what to do with YOUR money each moment of the day whether you are buying, hodling, or selling.

I remember when we were so excited that yelp added a Bitcoin filter. Acceptance as a currency was all we cared about in the early days and we were excited to spend our Bitcoin anywhere it was accepted. The atmosphere surrounding BTC sure has changed since then.

There are no "experts". 
The faster you realize that no one has any clue which direction the market will go, the more peaceful your life will become. Finance is the only world in which you can know nothing and still be right 50% of the time. And since you are right 50% of the time, and so many people are playing this guessing game, you end up with people stringing together some amazing and impressive win streaks, streaks long enough to convince people that they have the slightest idea of what they are talking about, when, in fact, they are doing nothing but getting lucky flipping coins.

Not sure why everyone is hating on it. I think he did a great job and it's a fun tattoo. Hope OP continues to find joy in it and it sparks good conversations.

Custody plays a big role. Futures contracts don't actually represent ownership of the underlying asset. An ETF has to actually posses the underlying asset, and coin custody is one of the biggest hurdles crypto has to overcome before institutional money can safely move in.

Sure you do. It's clear that luck has played a large role in your life already, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not.
