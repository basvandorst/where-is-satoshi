I took two semesters of Java while I was in music school and it was very stimulating for me to think about solutions so differently.
Object-oriented programming was probably one of my favorite classes I'd ever taken in college.

Wasn't Jihan Wu one of the six people who signed off on SegWit2x?

It's pretty easy to code in new coins. I could spend another evening putting in more if I decide I need them.

Thanks! I wish I knew about these apps before hand. Luckily, this also give me live rates.

Thanks for the suggestions. I've only dabbled into C# for the past few days (switching from Java). Is there a reason why explicit types aren't preferred?

For those who are curious, the current values are automatically retrieved from 
The user inputs how much they've invested and owned. 
Everything else is calculated automatically.
* EDIT 1: If you want to try it here's a link:  As always, always take correct measurements to ensure you are protected. I encourage you to run any and all scans.
* EDIT 2: I've updated the program to fix some minor issues and "Refresh Values Every" function is now working.

That's not a bad idea.

Part of me wishes I knew that before I did this. But, this was a great way to familiarize myself with C# as a hobby.

There is a video of Linus explaining bitcoin somewhere. However, I think it was when Linus was under another channel.
I enjoy Linus.

Just out of curiosity, could you please elaborate on the second half of your statement? Why haven't they been allowed to invest?

Thanks for your answer. For future reference, in what time frame would it be safe to start transactions after a fork? 2 weeks? Or is it situational based?

SegWit != SegWit2x. 
As far as I know, choosing the SegWit wallet will keep your transaction costs lower and help with SegWit adoption. 
SegWit was developed by core developers that helps with optimization to the protocol.

I don't think it matters which it is in. If you really don't know which to pick, then stick with SegWit.
