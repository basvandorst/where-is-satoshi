Managed to find it. Thanks. Now just having issues as apparently my wallet is an imported wallet and isnt secure, so id have to transfer funds to new wallet. I believe its to do with them going to HD wallets. Am i right in saying its best to just forfeit the transaction fee ($10) and have a more secure, HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet?
Likewise for the BCH?
Going to look into how to get bitcoin gold now

I transfered the wallet to the new HD type, and this wallet does not show the existence of the BCH i obtained.
Logging into the old (Non HD wallet) also doesnt show the BCH.
I got the direct wallet ID for the BCH from blockchain before, but the login process doesnt recognise the BCH ID. Also using the original wallet file shows no BCH and generates a new address.

I managed to recover it. Have 0.0119 BTC = $156 at current rates.
It was stored in a wallet via blockchain.info, does this mean i have 0.0119 of Bitcoin gold, bitcoin cash etc? How can i access this?

All the powerball numbers, not the bitcoin private keys - and wouldn’t that be more than a couple hundred thousand years, more like the age of the universe I.e not gunna happen on current hardware

Bitcoin paper wallets are relevant to bitcoin. An issue with storing your bitcoin is definitely relevant to bitcoin. Even if the issue isn’t too important it’s nice to be able to fix it, and it is likely not a problem just related to me.

But your computer could run through all the possible powerball numbers in not much time at all
It’s still an interesting comparison
