As of now exchanges are bitcoin's biggest point of failure. What we really need is an open source exchange platform where everyone can kick the tires and have a verifiable way (independent of trusting another person) to check which accounts hold what.

Net neutrality is *framed* around the debate of high-bandwidth services. However in practice once service providers have the ability to choose what goes across their wires. There is really nothing stopping them from cutting bittorrent traffic or anything else that isn't explicitly legally sanctioned. 
If ISPs are allowed to charge arbitrary rates or decide to vary internet speed, it is a very short step to selectively discriminate against sites or traffic based upon content. I wouldn't let myself get lulled into thinking that constitutional protection is guaranteed.

I don't know if you realize this, but more than a few people (myself included) saw the writing on the wall and tried to withdraw all funds -- both cash and bitcoins -- months back, but cash withdrawals never even entered the processing stage and bitcoins had a [50/50 chance of getting stuck]( So even for those of us who tend to be excessively careful and who like to manage our own money from our own wallet. Even we, the paranoid crowd, got screwed. This isn't a lesson in greed. It is a lesson in how exchanges can't be trusted.
@_date: 2014-04-19 12:03:08
Lets conduct an experiment. Go on Freenode and message magicaltux. If he responds to you within a day, come back and admit he talks with people all the time. If not, you can feel free to report back that Mark never-ever-ever would talk with some lowly random person on IRC. Don't let senseless anger blind you.

Every sell-side transaction from BTC to USD causes the value of bitcoin to decrease. Traders converted their bitcoins to cash to lock in the value because the BTC-USD conversion ratio couldn't help but to go down. Why? Because traders on other exchanges would have to be stupid to move the market up in the face of such a huge arbitrage gap. So it doesn't even matter what Gox is planning. Here is the thing though. Unless Mark has the IQ of a small rodent. He had to realize leaving trading open would cause the price to plummet. Traders are obviously concerned that Gox is bankrupt and then add on top of that there is a long delay to get cash into the exchange. This slows fiat from entering to buy the price back up. Thus goxcoins become "toxic." Since Mark knows the state of his company's finances. Rather than try to convince everyone they have the funds. The right thing to do would have been to block all trades. Had Mark done this people would no doubt scream bloody murder, but the BTC-FIAT conversion rate wouldn't have been so dramatically affected, since the markets wouldn't have become completely desynchronized. Yet, for some reason, whether out of malice, ignorance, or greed. Mark not only let trading continue. He blocked all withdrawls, causing a sell-off, and thus the price had no where to go but down. 
Bottom line: Karpeles instigated the crash by leaving Gox open for trading, but blocking all the exits. The only question is, why?
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:47:07
Now that was good for a laugh. Steering the conversation away from where it began? I was dead on point talking about how petitions have a positive affect with actual real-world examples. You on the other hand? 
The simple truth is anyone who is against this has some ulterior agenda. I suspect yours is "fun" one sentence trolling (considering your reddit history).
And for the record, I am no fawning fan boy of Roger. He's done some good and done some bad. But you're a saint right, cryptothief? Let me get my Zhou Tonged trollface out.
That doesn't negate the fact that Roger has made more on bitcoin than you'll ever see in your lifetime (sorry simple truth). Knowledge, intelligence, and trust are three different things. 
From what Charlie *knew* talking with Mark and from what Roger *knew* living across the street from MtGox. All of those details convinced people more in the know than you are that MtGox was in a better position than Mark let on.
Despite strong misgivings and my being very vocal about it.
Those of us (myself included) who saw the writing on the wall and who tried to withdraw our funds — both cash and bitcoins — months back, weren't so lucky because shittily enough cash withdrawals never even entered the processing stage and bitcoins had a 50/50 chance of getting stuck. 
So even those of us who tend to be paranoid (Luke-Jr, Greg Maxwell—all MtGox depositors—go ahead tell me your smarter than those amongst us who actually develop the software you simply *use*) and who like to manage our own money from our own wallet. Even we, the paranoid crowd, got screwed. This isn't a question of "who's smarter." It is a lesson in how exchanges can't be trusted.
No exchange is 100% safe and if you think they are you are a fool.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:56:03
That is a reasonable interpretation. However it would still be preferable to see a balance in the blockchain for peace of mind.

You did actually, "Mark wouldn't suddenly break his silence over the last few weeks to speak to a nobody."
I am not sure how to make this any more clear. Mark Karpeles is the owner of MtGox. He is on IRC as MagicalTux. Tiraspol is on IRC. You can connect to FreeNode (an IRC server). Then ask *both* of them if the conversation happened. If they both say yes. The conversation happened. This will clear up several misconceptions and reveal:
(a) Mark talks with people all the time (yes even nobody's)
(b) the conversation did happen and you are wrong about what you believe 
(c) the conversation isn't unlikely at all. 
(d) you are going to lose the bulk of your money in liquidation 
It is very easy to check these facts. It's odd you have no desire to.

Here is another possible narrative:
"MtGox is engineering the greatest crash to profit off, they dumped the coins at $800 and now they stop people from withdrawing their BTC. So the only choice is to dump their btc to lock in profits, then gox will buy at bottom and announce btc withdrawals and fiat are back and watch price rise up."

I don't think the five million dollar fine is that big of a deal. The .6% per transaction fee, on both buys and sells, tells me they were making a lot of money based on the volume. To have this big of a fuck up would require either fraud or they were refunding huge quantities of bitcoins without double spending the original input first.

I wonder if Dorian thought Leah was trying to get him to talk about his classified work for the government. That would explain him saying,

It's exactly because bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value in the traditional sense (meaning that people could use bitcoin for other functions — e.g. gold can be used in electronics and jewelry) that makes people want to circulate coins in the economy. Otherwise people *would* treat bitcoins like gold and horde it. The completely speculative nature of digital currencies is what will keep coins moving when we mint the last 21 millionth bitcoin. I think it's this very feature that might prevent a deflationary spiral.
