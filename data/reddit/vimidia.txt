You do realise it is used in all electronic manufacturing, satalites, medical, military. If it wasn't for gold you would not have computers or the tech we have today..
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:42:03
Also gold cannot be reproduced and is a well needed used resource.

This meme proves that no new money is entering the market. Tether pump and hype which will end  in tears all over again.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:45:49
Bitcoin and all crypto will not tank..Maybe big players pulling a bit out over Christmas..The gap gets filled by the little players the hodlers. 
In the New Year big players move back in and off the the races we go again. The media makes it sound like its end of crypto but al they are really doing is drawing more attention to the scene.
Big gains ahead in 2018..

Coinspot should hit up Bendigo bank....I hate how we can not choose how we choose to invest...Going to keep all my cash in crypto..
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:55:57
Bitcoin is not done but now a waiting game for the next few weeks after tbe incredible run. People have taken profit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:57:49
might be moving again....
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:10
Only if you cashed out...Little correction happening
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:27
Well not too bad..plenty of people ready to jump back in....

Aus housing market is tbe bihgezt ponzi schdme..Crypto is a safer bet atm..
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:48:55
I'm still very bullish on all crypto..All manipluated in hope to make the weak sell out. Crypto has come a long way in development from a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:09:22
I forgot that its nearing holidays and bet we will see a boom in price after New Year. People are going to brag and talk about their gains in crypto over Christmas dinner to family. We will see many more people investing in bitcoin and crypto in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:01:45
We all know that after the holidays mid January it will boom again..Good time tp.atart buying up again.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:16:34
No I thought the same but after Christmas we are going to see so many more people investing due to family talking about their gains. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 04:58:28
The difference now is that more people are using tradingview, techical analysis, following youtubers and trading short term instead of Hodl like in the past.
We will just keep buying selling to each other until its close to 100 bucks..
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:36:35
IMO market will just sit and stagnate dipping back  down before tbe hype. I dont.tbink there will be any major movement now until Feb next year and towards September 2018. A lot have cashed out half will now sit on the sidelines.
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:58:54
I believe we are at the bottom for September 18 Last 3 years lows of September all moved up and did not dip below August low. Bitcoin is growing year on year. Dont be fooled waiting on the sidelines and thinking bitcoin is going to magically dump to 3000. The whole crypto space is growing each year not shrinking. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:13:53
Funny how Craig Steven Wright claimed to be involved with Satoshi Nakamoto and tried to prove it but no one believes him. I believe Satoshi Nakamto was the pseudonym used by the group that developed bitcoin cryptogaphy and the person does not exist.

World currencies are sliding and petrol prices are on a bullish run in my country. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:59:32
It can happen anytime. I think it has already started. I would just hodl for the next few weeks..
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:12:12
The last time Mr Dotcom appeared was when bitcoin dropped to 4k AUD mid last year &amp; said people were crazy for selling and he was buying. By end of the year we were at a all time high this might be a good omen to what lies ahead..
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:44:43
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:44:43
Because it is being kept suppressed by major whales. The same thing happened last year..We all have to wait and go through all this bullshit then we hit 15k and 25k by end of the year. It's all controlled plus build momentum to push higher highs..ZCASH seems to be trading better atm.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:13:07
All crypto tanking and world economy as well..
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:12:09
You will be most likely Fu until March next year when bitcoin will jump back on halving hype..Enjoy the ride..Bitcoin will be big in 2030..
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:35:37
 If it does pump halving most likely jump back to Bakkt price and dump like LTC.
@_date: 2019-10-16 09:41:32
It's already factored in by those holdling the majority of bitcoin. There is really nothing to support current levels. The hype with the halving will start in March 2020.
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:08:41
Under 5k bitcoin coming soon..
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:40:49
Another option is to,put your crypto into Nexo and redraw your profit as a loan. You dont pay tax and can buy back in at the bottom or put the cash in bank.
@_date: 2019-10-28 06:07:30
Yes love your story.. The other day I guessed a password for my vet wallet on my phone. Took a year to guess the correct password..Must be a omen that a bullrun is near..
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:57:06
People it will go to 6k if you just wait..
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:27:30
No...would be absurd if it did. It's going to take a lot just to get to 30k maybe 2025-30
@_date: 2019-10-16 07:11:19
All I can see cheap bitcoin coming up soon in a few hours....No one will pay 20k bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:45:23
When a large sell order comes through an exchange it triggers the thousands of stop losses people have set to sell vs buy orders.
Shows more sellers than buyers. People will be looking for another dump to 5k before buying in heavily again. Bitcoin is just like a game of poker for some rich traders holders. Those in a profit will take it and push the price right down before scooping up bags off the small fry..
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:34:56
No you dont sell your bitcoin. Capital gains only takes affect when you seĺl.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:19:08
Buy around Feb as it will back around 5k level. Then bitcoin will run up again.
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:32:09
Hodl back to 5k..
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:55:59
I'm trying to do exactly that but keep on just winning $13...Lotto is a scam..
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:21
I agree that Monero will be the main coin used by the darkweb and bitcoin fucked off with the rest of the bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:00
Do you think bitcoin wil drop back down to 14k...
@_date: 2019-02-11 06:57:43
No one really knows but in 10 -15 years time someone will make a comment how did Bitcoin get to 400,000 and it's in a bubble..
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:47:08
Your an idiot.. Without stock market investment you would not have bitcoin or the phone you have in your hand. Our technological revolution has been because of capitalist investment in the stock markets.
Bitcoin trading is the greater fool theory based on hoptium and misinformation.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:06
Bitcoin is still a major part of the darkweb ecosystem and the reason for its core value. What does bitcash have just traders..
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:30:23
Only if its turned back to fiat.. Thats why you should pay bills with crypto not convert..
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:33:34
Bitcoin still gets most of its transactions from the darkweb. What does bitcash get used for atm? People forget this basic fundamental. 
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:06:41
Back to 5k or lower..No one wanting 20k bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:45
It's really up to the darkweb traders that really determine which currency will be king. They could all transfer over to Monero which is a better solution.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:37:52
Well bitcoin was developed from the darkweb and still is the main form of tranactions. 
For bitcash to succeed it needs to be actually used not just traded. 
Will the darkweb drop bitcoin is the fundamental question that needs to be asked.

Also the exchanges have turned the Altcoin bots back on. The Alts now following bitcoin trends again.   Looks like the whole exchange has been re- calibrated.

South Australia Police. South Australia back in the 80's was pot friendly. You could once grow a few plants for personal use until gangs started growing on mass and exporting to the other states of Australia. Plus Police stated break ins sky rocketed people trying to find grows.
But the mining rig is the new pot totally legal until police start complaining about false positive raids to Government.

No Monero will take over Bitcoin..

You are actually holding history. It could double or crash just like in Tulip mannia. One day you will say how could I have spent so much for this, what was I thinking. I should of sold it in the great and

I agree that tbe whole media scare tatic was staged for entry as cryto has no regulation and they want in on the action. As long as there pro traders with big bucks dont hijack with buying volume and run bitcoin into the ground and put people off buying bitcoin.

Could have been anyone or a combination of Chinese Government, Russian Government, Wall street traders Jp Morgan or just a rich bastard taking advantage of the situation. Good play..I bet a lot of little holders feel quite sick letting go of their holdings and not having enough time to buy back in..

Yes most people should get out when in profit but most end up ascending to forced hodling when it dumps below the initial investment.

I knew institutions would not be interested in Bitcoin futures trading and would rather stick to what they know and already manipulate. This has ended up like the litecoin halving..crickets chirping..

Bitcoin is not about making money. It's about belonging to a community and sacrificing ones income to the natural seasons cycle. Just watch the movie Midsommar and you will understand about sacrificing Noobs and our own to the Gods in this crypto world.

No new people just think it will go to $100,000 and see dollar signs and lambos.  Then once invested balls deep they start researching and shilling hoping for others to buy higher while there invest dumps by half. It will at least take until 2030 to remotely get close to 30k.
