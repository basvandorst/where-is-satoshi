Good point. I typed this fast, so some of the details may be off. The story was the main point. We need to show the consumer the immediate benefits of using Bitcoin as a payment system. Simplicity and safety from credit fraud are the benefits we should focus on IMHO.

It depends on the site. I've seen some that display the BTC price and a few that display both BTC and Fiat.
We hope to add the **BTC** price in the future. When you go through the checkout process, the BTC price is displayed before you purchase.

We need to simplify the message for the public. The public isn't stupid, they just don't have the desire to spend a month reading about bitcoin just because a bunch of computer programmers are excited about it.
The idea must be whittled down to it's simplest form so that anyone can get it in 30 seconds. We must hit the public with one major improvement over the current systems. Currently the credit card works pretty good (from the average consumers perspective) but there is one very major dent in the armour. I don't want my credit card and identity information compromised the way that Target customers (and other major retailers) was. This is the point that we must drive home to the public in order for Bitcoin to take advantage of this gaping whole in the payments system. This problem resonates with both consumers and retailers. Many major retailers fear that if they have an incident similar to the Target incident they could be forced into bankruptcy. Many consumers are now affraid to use their credit card in a retail store because of what happened.
**Here is my proposal:**
*(shopper  in a grocery store checkout line as the cashier finishes ringing up his groceries)*
**cashier:** "That will be $25.87. Cash, Credit or Bitcoin?"
**shopper  "Credit" as he swipes his card
*cut to a man in a "Target Security Company" outfit with a grocery cart which has 10,000 one dollar bills in it as well as shopper  drivers license and bank statement. He wheels it past the counter and hands it off to the grocery store manager.*
**manager to shopper  "Don't worry, your identity information and your $10,000 credit line is safe with us."
**shopper  "Target Security Company?" With a puzzled look on his face.
**manager:** "They handle security for all of our credit transactions. They are the most trusted credit security company in the business. Most major retailers use them"
*freeze frame on shot of "Target Security Company" man*
**narrator:** "You wouldn't hand your identity information and your entire credit line over for a $25 purchase would you? Actually that's what we do every time we hand over our credit card. In December of 2013, 5 major retailers lost control of millions of customers data and many customers had economic difficulties because of it. Some even had their identities stolen."
*cut to cashier finishing ringing up shopper  groceries*
**narrator:** "A better way to pay already exists."
**cashier:** "That will be $15.27. Cash, Credit or Bitcoin?"
**shopper  "Bitcoin"
*cut to closeup of shopper  scanning QR code with phone. Confirms $15.27 purchase price and presses big button that says "Pay now"*
*cut to a man with a grocery cart that has exactly $15.27 in it. He brings it to the cashier and she puts it in her drawer and says:* "No need for ID with bitcoin." She smiles and says "Thank you."
**narrator:** "Pay the exact amount digitally without exposing your identity information or your entire line of credit. Bitcoin: The safest way to pay"
Edit: formatting and spelling errors. Changed "types amount" to "Confirms $15.27 purchase price"

FYI... The video shows someone using '60s technology to access the first browser which was created in 1992. I can assure you that most of the people accessing the web in 1992 had an actual computer with a monitor. While it's cool to see how the browser might have been accessed with this technology, this is not a good representation of what computing and the web looked like in the early '90s
