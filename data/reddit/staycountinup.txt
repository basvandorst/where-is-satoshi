Got 5 more coming. Excited to officially be a part of the community!

The way we constructed our setup is basically like a big wind tunnel. We focus on venting heat out as opposed to trying to cool the beasts.
We may put in a mini split just for the summer months.

To be honest our exhaust fan is louder than the miners. It wasn't as bad as we expected.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:13:27
Got a conclusive source on that? We definitely don't want to harm the planet.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:49:20
Thank you! We have plans to become much bigger. Here's hoping!

No problem! We use [this fan]( We run the room like a wind tunnel. One side is intake with a filter, the other side is the exhaust fan/vent. We also have some big floor fans to help push it out.
As it stands, we replace the air in the room once every 3-5 seconds.

Thanks! We just have had so much fun with the experience of getting to this point -- I think we'll be okay with any result. Come what may! Just happy to be able to take the ride with everyone else.

Great feedback. Thanks so much.

Thanks for the reply! You mean solo mining? I was under the assumption we'd need 1-2 PH/s before thinking about solo.
How would one go about finding stuck transactions to mine?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:52:31
Mind going in depth on that a little bit? Sorry for the hassle, I'm just curious as to your reasoning why. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:30:19
Interesting idea. You mean run them each on a different pool and then see which one is yielding the best results after X time?
Thanks for the reply!

Don't ever leave your money or Bitcoins on an exchange. They could just up and take it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:24
Gonna look into it. Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:22:22
We invested some 60k in mining.
Worth every penny. Love how you put it. At the end of the day, at least we can say we tried something.
I'd prefer to not be a slave to the 9-5 for the rest of my life.

Your wallet of choice will give you an address. You copy that address and put it into the exchange when it asks you where you want to send your btc.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:18:59
That is correct. We personally use a keep key.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:06:33
Thanks so much. I did just that, and we'll make sure we take care of it.
Not sure how I've missed that!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:06:47
Thank you! I will try to keep you guys updated. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:56:21
Thanks, and we're excited to be a part of it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:10:29
Nice! These look great. There definitely may come a time where we switch or mix and match miners. Maybe even liquidate what we have and exchange them for the newer, better gens.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:13:17
We're not 100% sure yet. What would you suggest?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:06:51
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:36:15
Absolutely. Thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:20:03
Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:55:58
That's great to hear! How has it been for you guys? Do you stick with BTC or do you jump around?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:11:31
It takes time for them to be built, shipped, and then sent through customs. It's given us some extra time to finish some final prep work though so it worked out.
I'd still rather not wait. :| THE ANTICIPATION
