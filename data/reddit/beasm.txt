What are the benefits of this?

I think that's what they mean, is that they did this to get cheap coins and then when the price jumps as the withdraw ban is lifted and the ETF is approved they will make a nice profit

Ah I see what you mean, I've seen similar statistics before but I didn't take that into consideration

I loved that podcast, great listen. I just started Internet of Money by AA and I'd definitely recommend it

Am I correct in thinking that it's basically luck? If your miner just happens to get the right hash then you get the block reward?

Consider what the Internet did for information and data transfer and now think of what Bitcoin does for money and there lies the analogy. Just because you don't understand doesn't mean it's corny

Currently reading "The Internet of Money" and I definitely recommend everyone to read it

Any specific recommendations for books?

You could always have a wallet that you carry smaller amounts on you and have a main wallet. I was actually listening to Andreas Antonopolous on the Joe Rogan Experience talk about how you could also have a duress wallet which basically would have a small amount of btc in it so if someone were to rob you you'd give up that wallet and only lose whatever you put in it. He was saying he does something similar when in other countries where he keeps ~$50 USD in his front pocket so if he gets robbed he can give that up and that's basically all he has, or something along those lines

How..? I can get less than $0.02 in BTC so how is anyone in the world priced out?

I believe the reason for this is because they do that instead of having fees, so if most people are just buying and not selling on circle then they're making money off of it, I may be wrong but that's my understanding of it

I get where you're coming from but having to keep money in an address would be asking too much, you might as well just ask them to do a PGP signed message or something, but again people could just have a shared PGP

Are ledgers reliable? I was looking into trezor and keepkey but saw ledger as a cheaper alternative
