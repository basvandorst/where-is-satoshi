That is why it is called "uncomfortable")))
@_date: 2019-02-07 04:19:30
Thanks, man! Glad that you found it meaningful!
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:44:43
But I'm not trying to convince anyone in anything. What I do is just sharing the useful information for those who are interested. Average Joe is not interested for sure, but here is the space for those who are ;) 
@_date: 2019-04-19 01:31:47
Because people must remain skeptical even if they feel that they are told very reasonable things. Those cliches help stay sober.
@_date: 2019-04-19 01:33:05
I have no idea, my friend. It is just the opinion that many people have, but the majority of us don't even think about,
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:45:13
Didn't want to make a separate video for a meme, so just just watch a first minute and skip a second part with the market rambling.
P.S. Subtitles text is the real translation of what that lady says.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:24:11
It seems like the unit there has two more decimals than bitcoin... what is that mysterious coin?
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:41:01
A little Roger inside of us �� That is so true!
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:38:19
Absolutely! Timing is the only debatable issue...
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:46:55
Very well could be! Then they will become a new Mt. Gox. 
However, as it is rumored, they mostly have BCH, not BTC :) 
And also, I more tend to think that they will survive until the next bull-market and then they will be fine. Not the one among the biggest players anymore, but still OK.
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:37:43
Indeed! �� 
But these days it is just a common opinion that those are more or less legit as opposed to the ones that are claimed to be shitcoins here. So, it is just a joke, nothing more ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:40:07
Come on, man, it is just a joke. If you'd ask a bitcoin maximalist, all the alt coins are scam and shitcoins. If you'd ask others they would argue about their coins are the best and so on. 
It is just that XRP and BCH have a lot of hatred and it is better to laugh than hate, right? ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:41:28
Thanks, man!
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:35:04
Thanks, man! I'm really not a rapper, just tried it out.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:15:04
For sure! Good point!
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:10:42
It is just a metaphor – to make point. 
Maybe, banks etc really keep an eye on crypto. But my point is that eventually it will kill the SYSTEM, and the new one will be very different.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:12:04
From what time people started to treat everything in a direct manner? ;)
It is a sketch and should be seen as such.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:12:38
They deserve it... they shouldn't eat poor flies...
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:28:30
"there is no coin" – even a deeper thought IMO :)
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:22:57
There was "BTC" in the original post.
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:42:46
I don't know really :D 
I see four possible reasons: 
1) cruelty 
2) revenge 
3) curiosity 
4) hunger 
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:57:47
Thanks, man! 
It is such a rollercoaster... And just like with a rollercoaster, we got scared, but we love it!
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:17:43
Shall do! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-16 07:59:14
Thanks, dude!
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:44:02
Ha-ha! It wasn't intended! But nice coincidence :D
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:00:56
Wow! Thanks, man! At least, I'm not hopeless! :D 
One day it could be a whole album! LOL
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:11:26
At least not everyone found it awful! lol
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:22:08
I wish, there wouldn't be the reason for the last part :D 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:15:05
Good point! Thanks! 
At that particular case a rough price action was good enough, but overall, yeah, it is often useful to have the averaged data!
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:40:41
My pleasure! I just wanted to share this :)
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:40:10
I'm sorry, man :D
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:41:40
Oh, I'm very bullish 
It just reflects the major sentiment out there and the way how it feels for many (at least, as I see it).
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:10:49
Not that much. It is just the way the guy on drums performed.
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:19:20
I guess, many of us feel like that :) 
Except of those clever bastards, who went short multiple times in 2018...
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:37:38
Thanks, man!
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:52:55
Thanks, man!
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:57:30
It could be an epic fail, but worth trying! :D
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:19:29
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:11:56
I wish, I could, my friend... 
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:38:28
Thanks, bro! Really appreciate it!
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:57:18
Thanks for your advice, man! 
If I will not be completely discouraged about it and will ever try to do something like that again, I would play with all that next time! :)
Anyways, it is more like a side thing, just what I had in mind and wanted to share, while mostly I am just doing some random rambling about bitcoin on my channel :) 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:15:07
Yeah, I know, I am an awful rapper (or whatever you'd call the stuff that I made)... Just tried to tell, what I felt and hoped that the words were not random, but followed the history of bitcoin and reflected the major points/events/sentiment in the space. 
In any case, I will try better next time! ;)
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:13:25
At least, it must be the time to start to consider averaging down your losses – that's for sure! But yeah, I also believe it must be huge! Don't want to call on any particular alts, but BTC must come to a new ATH one day.
@_date: 2018-12-16 07:59:33
A cyber-hamster ;)
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:21:20
Thanks, bro!
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:58:54
I feel it too, man... I just hope that we will have a chance to feel those a couple to time more – especially the highs! LOL
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:10:53
Sorry, man! I'll try to do better next time :D
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:21:09
Thanks! I think that at least, I will try to do something for the space than just HODLing :)
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:17:27
Exactly! The price doesn't mean anything anymore except the marker for the panic of those, who remained holding. 
I also often blame myself for not entering BTC market earlier... well, all in all, it is the lesson that matters, opportunities appear all the time!
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:19:59
Even that kind of pain is helping to the lamb days to return... I hope...
