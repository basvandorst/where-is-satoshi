If you go to gdax it says "Partially Degraded Service,"  and if you look at the explanation, it says "Bitcoin Network: Degraded Performance."  There are probably *a lot* of people buying/selling/transferring Bitcoin right now so it might take a little longer.  Don't worry, as long as you sent it to the correct address, you'll either get your Bitcoin or it will be refunded to your account.

If you set a stop sell order at 10k, you will sell your BTC when the price drops to 10k.  It's a "stop loss" order.  If you think that when bitcoin drops to 10k it will keep falling, or that's the price that you aren't willing to see bitcoin drop below, you set a stop order at 10k. 
Let's say you bought 1 BTC at 5k and it jumped to 6k.  If you aren't willing to lose any of your initial investment, you'd set a stop order at 5k to cash out before you lose money. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:48:53

Link a bank account to Coinbase, transfer USD to your account (no fee), transfer USD to GDAX (no fee), set a limit order to buy bitcoin (no fee), then send to your wallet from GDAX (no fee).
You said it's urgent, so I don't know if this will really help since transferring USD from your bank to Coinbase usually takes about a week.  You could use your credit card and get your Bitcoin immediately, but you'll pay a 3% fee.

I started reading as much as I could during my free time and saw the potential.  As Andreas Antonopoulos puts it, it can bank the un-banked.

I was just thinking about this, couldn't the government ask banks to provide them with accounts that have been used to buy bitcoin?  For example, if the US suddenly banned bitcoin, couldn't the gov't simply ask the banks to identify customers that have transferred money to an exchange (kraken/coinbase/etc)?  Bitcoin isn't exactly an anonymous currency.

You realize it dropped from 5k to 3k about a month ago, right?  I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying you have no idea what's going to happen in the future (especially with TWO forks happening in the next 29 days). 
What happens when everyone that dumped their alt-coins before the fork starts moving their money back to alt-coins?  Nobody knows.  But I'm guessing BTC is going to see a dip, and I'll buy.

@_date: 2017-09-16 06:01:38
Thanks for the info.  I just spent the last 5 minutes (probably not enough time) learning about candlesticks and before that I stared at the gdax screen for a long time trying to figure out what I was seeing.  I'm guessing that I'm seeing buys/sells on the left (with purchase orders/sales sitting stagnant until the price hits), and on the right I'm seeing the most recent transactions?  I'm not really sure what the right column is, to be honest.  If it was the most recent buys/sells it should be moving at a faster rate than the left columns....right?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:49:35
I googled it because I like to completely research something before I do it.  Fun activity, google "transfer from gdax to wallet" and look at the results.  None of the top results explicitly say that it's doable, and when that's the case I like to make sure I'm covering all my bases.
Even though you were slightly condescending, you did give me a legitimate answer, so thank you!

If coinbase decides to support both coins and someone has Bitcoin in their Coinbase account at the time of the split, would they then own both coins?  Say I had 1 BTC in coinbase, would I have 1 BTC and 1 of the new coin after the fork?
How does this work for coins stored in a hardware wallet?
Sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm just trying to figure out how this works.

Would "fake" orders really have that much of an impact though?  Coinbase is only one of many exchanges.  They might be able to give it a slight bump, but nothing significant or lasting, as far as I know (and I don't know much, I admit).

It's the latter.  He's financially secure, is about to retire, and sees it as a fun little experiment to try out with me.

Genuinely curious, because this isn't something I've heard about before, how can they artificially inflate the price?  I know that if BTC is listed at $5000 on Coinbase you're going to be buying in at $5030ish, but other than that how do they inflate the price?

Your money invested increases/decreases at the same rate Bitcoin increases/decreases.  If 1 BTC is worth $100 and you own .5 BTC, you have $50.  If 1 BTC jumps to $500, your .5 BTC is worth $250.  The only way your money will *perfectly* track the price of BTC is if you own exactly 1 BTC.
You made a 41% (ish) profit off of your $100 investment.

For me, it's because they are only looking at it from a $$$ perspective.  I realize that a lot of people are buying bitcoin looking to make money (I'm one of them....for the most part), but the true potential of bitcoin lies with how it can transform global banking and empower the population, and that will take time.  The investors will come, the price will skyrocket, but the mass adoption will take a long time (relatively speaking).  Right now, bitcoin is a bubble that will keep on growing for the near future, but I think (nobody knows for sure, 100% speculation) it will eventually burst and have a huge drop.  When that huge drop happens it will scare a huge percentage of the population away from bitcoin and that could hinder it's potential to gain mass adoption as a global currency.

Any answer you get is 100% speculation, because nobody knows what's going to happen 10 minutes from now.  I'm holding what I have and waiting to see what happens after the fork next week.  Again, 100% speculation, but this ATH could be people dumping alts and buying more BTC to take advantage of the fork.
It may bite me in the ass, but I'm waiting this one out.  The gains over the last 9 days have been huge and again, pure speculation, but I don't think it will be above 6k next Thursday.  But who knows?
