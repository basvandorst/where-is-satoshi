If he was running a scam, wouldn't it be simpler to just spend a proportion of the dollars &amp; bitcoins that users send him???? (On coke and hookers or whatever takes his fancy)
He'd never get found out, provided he retained enough dollars &amp; bitcoins to cover withdrawals - i.e. only a small proportion of users make withdrawals. And if he capped the amount that each user could withdraw in a day, that would make it even easier to operate such a scam.
This is pretty much the scam Bernie Madoff ran (of course he didn't invest the client's money either), and he got away with it for at least 20 years. Madoff's scheme only blew up when a lot of people started to withdraw money at the same time.
And the exact same thing happened with Stock Generation. With the immediate precursor of impending collapse being when they started to place limits on withdrawawals.
Of course, I'm sure Mtgox wouldn't be doing anything like that.
