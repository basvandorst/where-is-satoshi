Everything she says shows that she knows absolutely nothing about the law. And Ross needs better lawyers because the arguments they are making are *really* dumb and now his mom's parroting them.

Do you realize how dumb that is? Let's think about this logically for a moment. As an example, let's say you bought something off of Newegg for $100 in bitcoins and then bought the bitcoins back.
Before the transaction, this is how everybody stands:
You: b dollars and c bitcoins
Newegg: d dollars and e bitcoins
Coinbase: f dollars and g bitcoins
So you something on Newegg that you want and send them $100 of bitcoins through Coinbase. We'll call that $100 of bitcoins p. We'll call Coinbase's fee for this q. This is how everyone stands now:
You: b dollars and c - (p + q) bitcoins
Newegg: (d + 100) dollars and e bitcoins
Coinbase (f -100 + q) dollars and (g - p) bitcoins
Now Coinbase asks you if you want to purchase the bitcoins back. You do so. This is how everyone stands now:
You: (b - 100 - q) dollars and c bitcoins
Newegg: (d + 100) dollars and e bitcoins
Coinbase: (f + q) dollars and g bitcoins
Do you see what happened? Everyone has the exact same amount of bitcoins they started with; the only thing that has changed is how many dollars everyone has. Bitcoins did not enter this transaction at any point. 
All that happened was Coinbase moving things around on their internal ledger and took your $100 in *dollars* and gave it to Newegg and then took a fee from you in *dollars*.
No bitcoins ever change hands. How does this make any sense to you people? Seems like Coinbase has got a tidy racket going by fleecing you people.

Yes, you are. Newegg runs similar sales for paying by Visa.
