I understand what your trying to state. I just don't agree with how you said it.
At the most basic level: 'Stupid' and 'ignorant' aren't even things that can objectified. For every person you think is stupid, somebodies thinking the same thing about you.
Also, you said I was "ignorant as fuck" without basis, after complaining about the quality of another discussion. You're doing the same thing here.

With pushforpizza acting as a middle-man, I am wondering how the conversion of BTC to fiat occurs?
Does it happen instantly during the order, or do you guys temporarily front the money yourselves before the conversion finishes taking place  (so the order can occur faster)?
How well would it scale (given sudden growth)?
Will every location be available when paying by BTC?

Seriously? You do realize buying from darknet markets is drastically more expensive and takes more time and effort to procure right?  
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:06:30
The vendor review system darknet markets have would surely increase the chances of receiving a high-quality product, but it doesn't eliminate the risk entirely.  
It should be noted that Mr. Robot was able to acquire morphine easily on the show and that it was actually a drug called Suboxone he had trouble finding.
Suboxone, unlike morphine, is not exactly a readily available drug since it's used to treat morphine withdrawal symptoms. In this respect, it's not something drug dealers would be interested in mass producing and would only be available under special arrangements - or in other words - through people who work in pharmacy/chemists/academics. Therefore, almost all of said product on the black market would be of professional grade quality as it's basically all that's available, on the streets or darknet.

It looks attractive enough, but I'd never download torrents through Tor. It's really bad for the Tor network ([discussion here](
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:54:56
Started with BitTorrent, went to ABC, BitComet, Azureus, Vuze, uTorrent, Trixi, Deluge, qTorrent, and now I'm on Transmission-Qt.  
I'm not a fan of torrent clients but Transmission-Qt is my favorite so far. It provides a really good balance between simplicity and detailed information I have yet to discover in another torrent application.  
Highly recommend checking it out, as it's harder to come across (being for linux originally). Don't recommend Deluge due to the non-native interface. Using the file browser is like going back to 1995.

I think you confused altruism for honesty. [Altruism]( is when an individual places others above themselves no matter the expense. I.e. volunteer work etc.

On the contrary, I found the purpose of this documentary to be quite obvious. They are simply trying to prove whether bitcoin can be practically used as a currency.
The reality aspect of the documentary is what makes it work. We aren't the target audience. This film is intended for the people who know nothing about bitcoin.
By showing every step of the process, they will essentially be creating a fool-proof guide to bitcoin.
The documentary you want wouldn't make sense to create at this time. The only people that would be capable of understanding it would be those already using bitcoin.

Are you sure about that? A higher market cap should actually prevent companies from joining the market. At least right now. So long as the speculation continues and the BTC keeps inflating, nobodies going to take the risk of integrating it as a legitimate form of payment until it stabilizes.
