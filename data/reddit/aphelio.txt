This is really cool. I'm not a lightning expert, but it seems to me that being able to open a few channels at once sort of enables a highly available connection to the network for the cost of a single transaction. Instead of Bitcoin users paying blockchain fees for every transaction, they instead pay a fee when they need to essentially "fund their checking account". It potentially changes the whole fee debate.

I think you could be correct. It's crossed my mind that this Wright guy happens to know that he is dead and it's the only reason he can be so confident that he won't be suddenly and brutally contradicted. Pure speculation though.

Just curious, you "actually don't" what?
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:09:22
Here's my theory FWIW... 
The alt market caps are relatively small. They likely each have a select group of holders who reeeally care about the alt and have a ton of influence simply because the money they have to trade represents a significant proportion of the market cap.
Imagine yourself in that position, heavily invested, watching the Bitcoin community grow and thrive, knowing your alt is only really a slight variation on the concepts that Bitcoin introduced. Your investment would feel vulnerable. But it's your bae coin. &lt;3
One way to hedge your bets is to hold a bunch of BTC. If the price takes off, you can pump bae coin with profits. When it drops, time to buy back BTC. This gives the general market the illusion that the alt price shows similar movement and supports some false confidence that there is potential for growth.
So I think BTC can keep an alt afloat. You just need a few prideful, wealthy advocates and a little trade automation. But a volatile BTC price makes this strategy prone to error. Whether or not any of that theory is correct, I have to admit it's a guilty pleasure for me to watch BTC gain on the pack. To me it's just as fun as gains on USD.
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:08:25
Theory: Each alt has a group of wealthy advocates. They hold BTC and when the price surges, they use the profits to prop up their favorite alt. This works great in a bull market, but watch out when BTC price dips. This is all theory, and feel free to call me out on speculation. But if I'm correct, I think it's really ironic because it means the most powerful alt advocates don't actually believe their alt will outperform BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:09:00
What the graph doesn't show is how far we've been below the line in the past as well. When BTC price jumps it jumps by multiples. I think we'll see that happen again.
That said, I think McAfee is wrong about his prediction, and he knows it. $60-100k all time high in the next 2-3 years is a reasonable optimistic view. $1M, no way. An $18 Trillion market cap is basically 25% of all the money in the world. We're talking about Bitcoin becoming the world's  currency in like two years. Not gonna happen, makes for great hype though.

Makes me sad to see so many people posting "Bitcoin is not useful currency, it's just a store of value". Goes to show that too many are (subliminally?) accepting the Bcash propaganda.
The vision is, and always has been, that Bitcoin is crypto- *currency*. We may have quite a bit more software development ahead of us before that is reality, but it's a complete underestimation of the trajectory of human technological advancement to assume we can't get there from where we are now. People are already making realively small lightning payments with fairly reasonable fees and Segwit adoption isn't even at 50% of nodes yet.
It's okay to describe Bitcoin as a better store of value than currency in it's current state. It's true. But accepting the current state as the best we'll be able to achieve is not only pessimistic, it's a bit naive.

@_date: 2018-08-20 14:35:37
Taking a second to dream big... Let's say BTC gets into the $1,000,000 USD range sometime in the distant future. That would mean 1 Satoshi is about $0.01 USD, right? So in terms of BTC feasibility as a currency, is ~$1M sort of a theoretical max assuming we need a denomination roughly equal to one US cent? Or do you all think it's not such a big deal if a Satoshi became valued higher than a penny USD?
P.S. Hopefully everyone in this thread is loving life if we hit $1M, anyway. Cheers to that!

Tether may have been irresponsible. I'm no expert on their history and practices. But unless Tether is said "lone whale", I'm not seeing how Tether printing unbacked tokens means that a single BTC holder manipulated the market. If that's what you're saying, can you clarify the connection? Or are you presenting that as an alternative explanation for the price spike in Dec '17? Also, is it not possible, no matter what happened in the past, to validate that Tether is currently able to back their full supply? If they are, wouldn't that mean that they somehow managed to come through with money they supposedly printed? Please don't view this as a counterargument attempt, I'm genuinely curious to get your insight.

I can't believe you're still talking after embarrassing yourself twice. Once by telling us that Satoshi runs Windows, ergo .NET is perfect for Bitcoin, which makes absolutely no sense. Then you defend the use of .NET for Bitcoin because big banks use it. You're on a roll, man.

Yeah I'm sure you learned .NET on Linux, bro.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:10:26
Okay, I think I mostly get the theory. Some Tether exec (or whatever) prints unbacked tokens and issues them back to themselves, then trades those tokens for legitimate cryptocurrency tokens. This was supposedly to the tune of $3.5B.
The part I still don't get (not your fault, it's not your job to teach me) is how $3.5B in free money turns into $100+B pump of the crypto marketcap. There's some cyclical pattern you're describing there that I'm not quite grasping, but maybe I just need to think about it more.
The last part is interesting to me. Does Tether refuse to be audited? Have to admit that is a red flag. If there's anything a stablecoin should be able to do is prove its reserves match whatever it has issued.

Hey just wanted to echo this sentiment. Sorry guys, .NET was a really poor choice. What were you thinking? Did you really think the Bitcoin community would embrace a .NET implementation? is 1000% dead on. Either rewrite your software in a language/framework that the open source community truly embraces, or just get crushed by someone else who doesn't start off with a huge and totally avoidable disadvantage. Fuck yeah you're gonna sit there and suggest people run this in a Linux container, because nobody's gonna install .NET core directly on their VM. C'mon guys, get a grip. Know your audience. Great idea, great project, terrible stack choice. So disappointing.
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:59:42
Sorry you thought it was inane. You have to admit it's true. We were debating a language/framework choice. Windows is fine for a Desktop, especially if you're fond of antivirus applications.
Anyway, I already stated my qualm. It is simply an impediment to adoption. One thing I very much respect about this project is that it is a donation. As far as I can tell, it's purely philanthropic, and I don't see a money-making angle on the part of the developers. I *think* the goal is ultimately BTC adoption. The devs can correct me if I'm wrong about that. So if the goal is adoption, why introduce unnecessary friction by choosing a polarizing language/framework. Remember, as pointed out already, the history of C# / .NET is basically Microsoft forking stuff from the Java community and keeping it closed in order to create vendor lock-in while calling it original. Remind you of something? BCash, anyone?
Portability only *just* became a thing for .NET, and not because M$ felt philanthropic. Because they were losing market share and had their backs against the wall. There are so many other stacks that are either more portable or even just Linux-native. I guarantee that many developers will take one quick glance at the .cs extension on those class files in GitHub and move right along instantly. Yes, that's the case for any language, but especially C
It's easy to say "just install .NET core" But many merchants do not have that level of control in their environments. Even if they do, adopting .NET core just for the purposes of running this software is a non-starter in many cases.
Long story short, it's all about adoption and eliminating friction. This project will appeal to a niche audience that isn't turned off by the stack choice. It's just a shame that there will have to be another implementation to get the rest on board.
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:04:17
Okay, note taken. I won't give any more feedback. Cause that's why people publish open source and make Reddit posts. So they can get praised and congratulated, and live in a criticism-free bubble. /s
One thing you're definitely right about, C# is more popular than Go. You're right that 2 million people working for large corporate financial institutions like *banks* never learned to do anything outside of the M$ ecosystem. Think about that for a sec -- you are literally defending the use of .NET because it's well accepted in the corporate culture of the very institutions that BTC stands against. That's so ironic and hilarious.
Go home, you lose.
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:41:42

Probably dumb question, but just curious, does "Secure the Bag" take advantage of Segwit?

Something other than fee revenue needs to incentivize miners during early adoption. As adoption grows, so does demand for block space, and so will transaction fees. Each halving weans miners off of the block reward (which is technically inflation, though at least predictable and diminishing) and onto transaction fees as the primary source of revenue. In the end, this theoretically leads to a perfectly stable supply, gradually, while incentivizing miners as consistently as possible along the way.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:53:19
Agreed, Segwit will only gain adoption out of necessity. Right now it's pretty cheap to do on-chain transactions. I'm a little worried that the "laziness" means we will be unprepared again....
Anyway, to relate back to OP's question. There are too many variables in the equation to predict the impact of Segwit. We will only be able to measure in retrospect, I think. If I had to guess, I'd say we'll see an impact that is roughly equivalent to scaling block size x2, mayyybe x3. Total guess, though.

The way people talk about Satoshi like he/she is divine is a little scary, like Satoshi's words are gospel.
@_date: 2018-11-13 06:08:01
So the speculation is that "Satoshi" has &lt;1M coins. We can only speculate that because they were mined early and they haven't moved. But remember, even 1M BTC is ~6% of the total and shrinking. BTC at -6% is just a shitty trading day, it's not earth shattering, we've seen worse. Especially in an imaginary future where BTC is the dominant world currency, nobody would really notice because there's no significant fiat to compare to the value of BTC.
I think Satoshi is an extremely patient person / group of people. They didn't cash out at $1M, or $10M, or $100M, or even now at over $6B. Like anyone would, I think eventually they would gift most of the coins to family and friends and maybe some charities. Even if 1BTC was worth $100k, Satoshi could make 100 x $1B gifts. It's a way more reasonable sum if you imagine it divided among even just 100 individuals or organizations.
Long story, short, Satoshi is just the ultimate HODLer.

The BTC blockchain grows more or less linearly, the growth suggested by Moore's Law is hyperbolic. It doesn't really make sense to claim linear growth is outpacing hyperbolic growth.
That said, there's plenty of room for other skepticisms. Like for example, Moore's Law may not be an accurate prediction of technological process, or that hard drive capabilities are necessarily correlated with Moore's Law due to some specific limitation.
At least the Bitcoin community is acting responsibility in terms of managing block size. Others seem to think disk and bandwidth grow on trees.

Libra (or another corporate-sponsered digital currency) is widely and quickly adopted by merchants. The assets that back Libre perform relatively well against major fiat currency and it attracts consumers. Libre essentially becomes the cash of the Internet. New Bitcoin adoption is stifled.
Justification: Bitcoin has developed a reputation as a store of value and lost some of its identity as "borderless cash". I am optimistic that a second-layer protocol will complement the Bitcoin blockchain and support small transaction use cases, even at $100k BTC price levels and beyond. However, we haven't seen this at scale yet. There is a chance that there is LN has an architecturally instrinsic vulnerability. Starting over on a layer 2 solution would really set BTC back. Even though the "store of value" narrative is compelling, we still need to buy a coffee with BTC. We'll be able to do that with Libra pretty much day 1.
