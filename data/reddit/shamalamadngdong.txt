Here is why:
James is smart, he wants to earn interest and put his money somewhere safe. 
Depending on the TVM principal (time value of my money) he could stand to earn a good sum.
Bank takes James’s money and uses it. Bank generates capital gains from investments, acquired assets, loaning money etc making buku money for the bank and comparatively small money for James from interest earned. James feels warm and fuzzy and likes bank. James keeps putting his money in the bank. 
During this time The Federal Reserve bank is telling the US Treasury to print more money to prevent inflation, thus deflating the value of the money James put in the bank. 
James has more money from the interest he earned but since the dollar is deflated He can buy less then when he started a year ago.
All that being said... banks do have upsides! Such as loans, storing money,  generating interest. However our banking system has become greedy beyond comprehension and this is my grievance with our current system. 
We are fixing that problem James.
Block chain - check it out my friend. 
The world is yours
EDIT: my apologies on the inflation / deflation mistake I it should be vise versa

That’s a risk each of us has to choose but for now you are absolutely correct. It is an extremely volatile market. 1 month in crypto = 1 year in stock equities market

The FDIC does not insure a technology which is what blockchain is. The FDIC insures deposits per individual depositor up to $250,000 for each separate account. 
When a block chain based currency is indexed and the SEC figures out how to regulate the space, Insurance will follow suit. 
What do you think?
