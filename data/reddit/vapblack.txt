Why didn't the programmers foresee this in the beginning? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:16:59
When was 5% ever a calm morning?
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:38:29
Crazy. Where would Litecoin be in this rise? In the same period, it went from &lt;$1 to &gt;$50. Just my rough estimate places it 300-650ish? being that its 3.63 right now
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:44:02
in my bank you can still use the atm for deposit/withdraw and the debit card for instant purchases. 
I love cryptocurrency, just saying that your bank being down just means that the bank you chose sucks. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:14:05
hmm. That big rise and fall happened at the same time as this auction. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:09:41
How do you know? do you work for CB? If not, there's no way you could know who's really the vocal minority..
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:48:16
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:42:45
Nice. People like you should be more vocal with that idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:51:46
Would that mean that you are paying double for the item?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:45:33
I've seen people theorize that the cryptocurrency protocol could have been created by shady people with nefarious ideas in mind. 
Sure it's probably not the case, but it could be. I think that should be a more spoken about thing.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:56:55
how can you tell?
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:53:15
If there is a big enough portion of people having problems that can actually make CB look bad, maybe that should be addressed.
If this one positive post gets so many upvotes, so should negative posts. 
There exists portion of the people that are having trouble acquiring btc.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:33:35
But I was moreso thinking, If I sent BTC to someone there, what could they use it for. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:06:25
wow nice. so if I keep this client for the next 50 years, that number should get pretty high. I should email myself a reminder. that will be some good reddit karma.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:57:59
What village?
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:05:28
I heard that. But I would also have mad shit shipped to me that I didn't partularly need.
* Nice computer parts
* Exotic seeds for growing fruits
* Books
.... 
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:16:17
Yeah I hear you.
I guess I'll have to wait for people to pull the trigger, I'll add a comment section or something somewhere
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:57:47
its called Trollcoin for a reason
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:54:50
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:04:48
I don't know of any services that allow you to buy BTC instantly with dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:09:27
Yea I get a nice chuckle whenever someone mentions tulips. I'm mostly concerned about satoshi and the NSA influence. With all they have been doing lately, why isn't it possible that its a tool created by big bro to control the world's finance more effeciently.
Finally, if it is possible, maybe we should be using more of our energy exploring this possibility. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:27:07
hmm thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:00:33
Take that bet  I think the OP is correct. Not sure about the correction all the way down there
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:59:54
you have to wait till it arrives. It will arrive at the amount you bought it for today. Double edged blade.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:33:49
flip a coin. Heads buy now, tails buy later. 
Repeat tomorrow
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:16:06
thats the first thing I thought
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:29:13
whats happening there?
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:36:47
Soooo thats not a very long time.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:05:56
That's some good advice. Do you think a hard drive back up is better than a laminated paper backup?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:42:21
I'd say the downside to your last sentence is looking for folks that take BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:59:11
Me too same as him
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:40:12
Shit. I'd be upset.
Keeping your coins offline is easy.download an app for ios or android, or use my advice above. Not 100% sure on how to make paper wallets. Its probably easy tho.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:06:52
My Ubuntu pw? Yea pretty strong.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:02:10
And, if you really believe that that BTC are going to rise, buying bitcoin first will eventually lead to you having spend less on the items in question.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:14:36
Im trying to change BTC to Ghana Cedis. Correct me if I'm wrong but those ways are changing fiat money in to BTC 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:03:23
How does not understanding that make op retarded?
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:20:05
First you got mad.
then you got EXTREMELY mad
then......you got very very angry!
you should focus all that rage.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:03:54
how many
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:51:03
Yea I guess that would be difficult. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:45:07
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:27:04
would one satoshi make a green address dirty?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:13:13
People are investing a lot of money in the coin. If NSA=Satoshi, that would mean that the USGOV has a lot of valuable coins right now. Maybe they see an end to this Fiat system and are trying down with their pockets full.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:58:58
Yea but the Localbitcoins community is non-existent there right now
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:14:38
so why wouldn't the majority of the people running nodes make a new version of of the software for their benifit?
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:03:31
And this is what I'm talking about.
Right when I mention it I get a sarcastic remark brushing me off.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:16:22
Because they well get less fees from customers using their services.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:14:53
Lol nice. Very risky though. What if miners do implement it?
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:36:14
Download electrum or bitcoin-qt and send your money there.
Damn...2.7BTC = over 1000$
was that your only coins?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:05:38
buy bitcoins transfer them to btce then buy ltc
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:58:26
..with a monocle on his eye too. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:44:40
Also if you don't trade, someone else is right behind you waiting to get that profit. (me)
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:54:20
hmm are we in for an april esque collapse?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:17:18


That grammar always scares me away
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:49:37
what company did u use?
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:09:19
what gox debacle?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:41:27
the fact that they put an apostrophe there is what scared me away. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:28:53
I have my acct linked to coinbase. That's not instant though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:42:32
so can you have 2fa backed up on two devices?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:24:30
Man...we are bravely entering a new world...
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:59:46
Looks like it to me. It can be a good thing or a bad thing. Particularly since you can't buy or sell while waiting. Its good because whatever prive you bought it at is the price you'll get it for in 7 days.
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:01:59
Makes sense. And those people would be more likely to want to support the economy. Since they are invested it it a lot. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:52:07
interesting. from what you say, a lot of people in this post are arguing from the perspective that the processing power does not look like human thought, and thus can't ever be sentient. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:43:31
What if the programmers have the majority of the coins. To do trade with them, one would have to use their version.
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:34:48
Thats one of my suspicions. I hope Satoshi is an Alien from another world that came to free us from the current currency paradygm, but I've become pretty cynical.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:02:10
yea what if its something small like $150, while you have something like 150BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:27:51
you can download a wallet that does not force you to download the 12gig.
one is called electrum. windows/mac/linux/android
I don't know how the pros and cons of the types of wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:57:58
If I had 300,000 BTC right now I cant say that I would only buy things I needed.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:39:08
How would you respond if they told you?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:28:44
Very long time? I'd bet all my coins that most of the people here have only been here for &lt;2.5 years.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:54:51
Answer the question of shut up. This is a very volatile subject and things are changing a lot. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:01:48
very interesting. diversity is key in this new environment. we are lucky to be in so early
maybe it shoulda been called bitbars. folks would probably be more inclined to get fractions of those.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:35:32
Yea we are brainstorming practical uses.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:44:56
But an apartment in Oslooooooo!!
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:01:28
Interesting. I have it set up to go directly to my wallet when people go thru the purchase. My store emails me where to send stuff. 
Does that seem shady? Will people be more comfortable if I used a middle man? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:36:20
Does this script buy for you when it reaches a certain number?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:31:57
It may seem like a foolish thing to do but people spending BTC today helps it grow in popularity tomorrow. Ostensibly you would be spending a little now making bitcoin in general more valuable later. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:51:44
wow. they'd get so much coin
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:06:13
what exchange?
