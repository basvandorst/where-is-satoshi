How about security of your transaction information.  How much information does a hack need to get from you to access this? 
Are all transactions carefully and centrally tracked as part of bitcoin?

I know, I've been watching it.   The higher it goes, the crazier it seems.   It did go down a good bit after I posted as I thought, but you could watch the buyers come back at around $650 in droves, and from there it was no looking back.    
There were plenty of money making opportunities along the way, but I haven't figured out how to do day trading with bitcoin yet.  
I haven't look at the chart for a few days, but will see if I can predict another down or buying opportunity.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:42:23

You can be successful at day trading currencies, and there are profitable strategies - but there are no trading platforms I know of that you can get instant trades, like with regular FOREX.  If I'm wrong please let me know, I considered Mt. Gox, but it doesn't appear to be the right thing.  
There's just not enough trading.. when you trade forex, you are leveraging tiny fluctuations in value, but bitcoin is more like penny stock trading at the moment.   Besides, it seems way to easy to manipulate the price with so few big holders of it. 
If you want to learn about trading, there's some good video on how to interpret charts and make money exploiting inefficiencies in the market.  (that's your job as a trader, to arrive at a fair price)

Even i wouldn't be so presumptuous to call the bottom... it's going down, and it's still got room to go before another small bounce, and then back down IMO.  where it stops?  who can say.. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:18:13
**Resistance, not support at $800.   Recommend next buying opportunity at $650** we'll see from there, but expect it to go lower after another bounce. much lower.  
For reference, I called the top at ~1200 correctly, and also the last dip.   I use candlestick charts and indicators from bitcoinwisdom, along with my understanding of chart reading, school of Nison.
    *In case you find my tips helpful and want to tip in return.*

I think $10 is possible.  Capitulation has begun.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:45:20
The idea of one thief crashing the currency by cashing out didn't sit well either.   The value peaked already, and I think the China news is just accelerating the inevitable.  
Watching it though, it looks like there's one or two big players really driving the price back up every time it falls, and probably there are people realizing this and making bank off it when it does.    Short sell on the the next peak etc..  This could get ugly.   Strange that it happens on a Friday night when many people wouldn't be paying attention..  FOREX markets are closed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:08:08
watch the manipulation as they try to prop it up.  it's like Sysyphus.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:20
nah, I tried to find something, I would be retired by now if I did.  
it just bounced up to $900... I'd be SELLL!!!!! and five minutes later scooping up profits at $800..  just amazing.   Very dangerous though, the price really appears to be manipulable..
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:05:11
bitcoin is not an investment vehicle it's a currency.  failure to be treated so will only end in disaster... just ask the Dutch and their tulips.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:34:55
cool thanks for answering.   I figure a lot of people are like you, buying as a commodity, but not intending to use it as currency.  I think this accumulation of bitcoin as wealth will be its undoing, as it's meant to be a liquid currency.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:04:09


that's bad and you should feel bad.  BTC is a currency not a commodity.  you get what you pay for.

go for it.. set a rate in bitcoins now and hold them to it.. chances are you will win :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:48:44
cool.  I learned to read candlestick charts a while ago - bitcoin is a bit of a different animal.  I'm really wondering about manipulation of prices and the huge variation in spikes concerns me.   On the same day the spread was more than +/- 50% of the price!
edit:  just looked at the 5 day chart.  the volume on the big sell-offs sticks out to me.  there seems to be some real great money making opportunities here if you have the nerve to ride the spikes.   Right now it's $640 again, and I'd sell here and buy again  at next resistance level down.. damn, wish I had some bitcoins now to trade for fun :)   What will it be in one week?  I expect it will trade within a huge range of prices and maybe even test new highs.  scary shit.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:24:45
lol you have no idea what you are talking about but ok.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:35:20
Because their system is inefficient.  There are too few trades and they need to be matched up.   Also I suspect some shenanigans.   Also seems to be a lot of confusion.. depending on the exchange it's anywhere from $600 to $700..
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:23:54
I just saw people place buys at $150 .. haven't seen that for a while.  So what's the spread... $850 to $150 now?   Selling pressure is huge. .check it out!
  
also there's at least one wallet with 90k stolen bitcoins waiting to cash out..that can't' be good.  already he's lost $30 million in value, and the more he sells the more it will go down.. I might buy at $150.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:46:06
good luck..  I don't forsee panic selling.. more like manipulating and profiting the swings and cashing out on the way down.
p.s. re: the downvotes, it confirms my sentiment of irrational valuation.  if you are going to downvote me at least have the courage to explain what you think is wrong with my analysis.

@_date: 2013-12-16 14:36:08
you can make a very good prediction based on leading indicators, and reading the charts correctly.   I stand by what I said.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:09:36
Now below 700..  will it rest where I called it?
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:47:58
I really hope so, because I would like to see the e-currencies succeed, and this is a good and expensive lesson for some people to learn (again)
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:39:00
as a vendor, I can't see how I would price my goods/services in bitcoins.   Besides, the distribution of wealth isn't exactly ideal.  Too dangerous.   
Sovereign countries could incept their own bitcoin currencies, distribute fairly, so they reflect economies of scale in the value.  
I think this is a much more viable and likely path to take.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:11:20
as if it's a FOREX market, not stock market.  it makes a difference for faggots.   
look at the chart history, if you know how to read charts you can see how the recent price crashes were indicated, and how the fibonnaci leading indicators hold as with any other currency... the big difference is that this one is WAY easier to manipulate.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:10:07
can you then move them to another exchange easily and cash out right away pocketing the difference?   that sounds interesting.   what happens when a lot of people are doing just that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:24:02
ya think it will?  even when there's someone with 90k bitcoins itching to cash out, and China trading is a no go.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:58:32
that's not fair.   thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:55
someone is trying really hard to keep it from falling.. there's some kind of plunge protection team at work here?   big holders presumably.  it's not working, I'm surprised they have held off the panic selling for this long.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:56:55
When bitcoin goes down to $10 again, maybe it will be useful.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:45:11


not exactly a good track record of honesty and fair dealing there.  


I guess it goes both ways, so far holders are unable to stop the decline.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:25:46
through hearing about silk road, and the onion web.  
then it made sense to me.. an illicit currency untraceable could fund all types of nefarious operations.. more, it could be controlled by a few big players, and even better, we can dupe people into crowd-sourced hacking for rewards.   When I read about CIA involvement, and Satoshi Nakamura (central intelligence)  I knew what was up.
 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:30:00
There's a fight on for $600 now...  I don't think it will stay there long though.  All of this on late Friday night when FOREX is closed
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:08:13
the currency is very prone to manipulation.  I've been watching the charts.  Lots of money making opportunities on the way down if you are trading it realtime.  Litecoin lost half it's value in 3 days.. how's a guy supposed to sell product with variability like that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:17:23
Mind if I ask why you bought?  Is it to hold, to trade for profit, or to use for services/goods?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:28:03
Here's my reason.  China isn't stupid.  They know what's up with the major holders of bitcoin and see what happened with Silk Road and Sheep Marketplace, amongst other insecurities. 
What China is reacting to is fundamental flaws in bitcoin.  One thief is trying to unload 90k bitcoins.. how will that affect the price?  How can vendors operate in such a marketplace with no liquidity and high volatility?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:36:03
it's a rigged currency IMO.  watching it now, it's amazing.   people are lining up to sell. .this could be a blip, but fear is contagious.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:21:17
I would wait until they get a little more scared, then buy.  Maybe at $450.. but then sell again if it goes to $600, or cut your losses at $400.  
Lots of money making opportunities on the way up/down, if you can get a good trading platform. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:20:31
the charts are still a good indicator looking through them..  other currencies are also affected by all sots of unknowns.    charts factor everything into the equation, which really comes down to fear vs. greed. 
I said earlier that I would sell at $640 and buy again when it hits support level.. I would have made a bundle when I bought again at $600..and that's without leverage.    I'm looking for a good bitcoin trading platform now, but not sure if there is one?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:42:03
Though knowing that you have people locked in to buy at $1300 right now that can't do anything about it can also be a huge source of profit.    
There's just not enough liquidity, and there won't be because nobody is risking those huge piles of cash on an exchange just yet, these are early days still.   
Seriously, If I'm selling a 1/4lb of weed, how many bitcoins is it?  1? 0.5? Should I sell all my stock now?  Should I hold onto it?  What do I do with these tulip bulbs?  Plant them?
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:05:16
sure.  if I can help.  I'm not an expert by any means.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:12:45
that's not inherently good for bitcoin.  India is notorious for scams and fraud for anything to do with money.  It's almost a game to them.. if you get scammed, haha hahaha.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:57:44
ah sorry missed your question.   I mainly look at volumes in relation to prices.   there's been more volume on the big downs lately, and small volume pushing the price higher.   this means that I expect the price to drop.   
next I see that we've reached a maximum due to characteristic candlestick patterns.. once confirmed I can call a short.   
after that, I'm looking at historical support levels to see where to buy in again, I quickly estimated around 650 (turned out to be 665.)   That's 800-665 or 1300 pips..  Crazy shit.  
I also use leading indicators such as fibonacci expansions.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:18:09
that worked out great for the dutch

@_date: 2013-12-18 05:47:38
I can imagine one or more of the exchanges might stop buying bitcoins for dollars any time now..     Mt. Gox first..
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:44:34
If bitcoin peaks here as it seems, It will go down to 1000 Yuan easy.. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:55:41
Just saw a 500 bitcoin buy at 750, plunge protection efforts being ramped up.. but it's obvious. 
edit, now another 500  at $736.    I can almost smell the vomit.
edit 2:  capitulation?  I see 1500 bitcoin asking at $700 that won't get filled.
edit 3: now down to $650 a minor support level, but I don't see what will stop it from breaking $500 tonight.
edit 4:  gets spiked to $770 within a minute and crash again.. some CRAZY action on Mt. Gox:  Shenanigans?
this is exciting.. never seen a currency lose 50% of it's value in real time like this.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:23:58
no it won't, because by then nobody is going to give you dollars for bitcoins.   deflation!
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:22:08
'regulating' is one euphemism.   seeing as bitcoin is distributed amongst a few power holders, it's fairly easy to manipulate too.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:44:21
check out the volumes..besides these exchanges aren't trading instantaneously.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:02:52
I've yet to do any analysis..  mainly been practicing my skills for trading traditional currencies, I figured bitcoin would  be a big challenge.  
the thing I'm looking at now is that there are all kinds of e-currencies popping up.  I actually thing dogecoin is the best investment at the moment. :)  
the problem with bitcoin is I don't see it getting above $1000 again because of the competition .. usually when you trade FOREX you don't need to hold the currency to short it (not sure how this works in bitcoin).   so I won't be getting in unless there's a big drop,  it's very tough to call the bottom, especially now as there's no real support level on the way down.. maybe psychological points like $500 will bounce a bit.   
Enjoyed making and seeing that call right on.. if I see something obvious coming up I'll let you know.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:52:14
next stop is $250?  .. not looking very good.  panic selling possible.  
this is china, where there are entire empty cities.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:52:51
this is the problem.  as soon as the public sees the value, speculators take over and instead of a useful currency you have a valueless commodity.  
that's why fiat currencies exist, and we don't use tulip bulbs or gold.. though lately dollars are becoming commodities and look at the results there!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:40:17

@_date: 2013-12-07 22:48:24
Yeah, but what's the point of a currency if most people are buying it to hoard?
As a vendor I'd be terrified of pricing my good/services in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:00:16
Sorry, couldn't hold $650 for you.  It might stick around and fluctuate, I haven't looked yet.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:34:43
If I could, I would institute national e-currencies.   Everyone would  be given a living wage.   I haven't thought much about the details, but it addresses problems I see with bitcoin.  
1) economies of scale.  different countries have different economies, and their respective currency values reflect that.  (unless you are Greece or Spain or Ireland currently)  
2) liquidity.   starting with a national base where everyone has money to spend.   can you imagine a game of monopoly where everyone starts with no money?    or only the winner of the last game has money?  
3) price stability . again, it's based on the economics of trade, and should be treated like any other currency in this regard.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:04:38

@_date: 2013-12-07 22:42:22

Watching Mt Gox is bewildering.  The price goes down to 650, so someone places a huge order at $675.   then the price goes up.    I'm sure they are making millions from the swings.

@_date: 2013-12-17 10:17:39
can you answer why there's significant arbitrage between the 4 main bitcoin exchanges?   MT. Gox is $100 higher than Btc/China consistently now.
is the Chinese fiat currency conversion against USD causing the discrepancies?   is it possible that China's fiat currency will win the battle against bitcoin, as people fear the falling value of the dollar?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:56:26
all of them.   the orders on the right can change and often do.   many of them are automatic trades with stop losses - so I don't put too much faith in it.    Fibbonaci traces are the most powerful leading indicator, they model natural iterative procedures well (such as buying/selling repeatedly until a fair price is reached)   
I'm hoping to get into day trading bitcoin and other electronic currencies once reliable and fast exchange is available.    Mt. Gox seems to be a bit shady, I'm not sure about it.   Today it consistently held the price 15-20% above what was showing on 3 other exchanges.   That's some very significant arbitrage.   
I think e-currencies will be crazy to day trade, but because the markets are so inefficient, there is some really easy money to be made.  I probably would have retired after today's call.. I would have timed the bounce and all... damn.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:46:12
I'd see what the lower resistance level is myself before buying.. also you have to think on the timescale that you are buying selling.    If I was into buying/selling bitcoins - I'd be doing it on a much smaller time scale and taking profits on the way up/down.   
I'm staying right out of it, mainly because of volatility, and the ease of manipulation of prices.  I'd rather trade JPY or AUD.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:09:35
imagine the poor guy selling 1500 bitcoins.. that he bought 3 days ago fro $1200 on a recommendation from Merryl Lynch, and not getting $700 .. that's got to inspire confidence!

the bottom is falling out right now.. ugly, but good for BTC 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:18:38
you would think so, but dogecoin is very serious, and slick too.   I think it has more appeal than bitcoin to people entering the market.  
today I got my first dogecoin tip on and yeah, it's worth a fraction of a cent, but hey it's accessible at that price!   
my other huge concern about bitcoin is that there are a very few big holders, and one of them (at least) stole 90,000 bitcoins and is trying to dump them.. I guess I'm not optimistic because of money supply issues, and bubbles are scary!  
good luck!  best thing to use bitcoin for now is as currency, which is why I hope the price goes down further.  what's the point of an illiquid currency that people hold only to invest in.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:43
look at the candlestick chart.  the latest few days indicate a big crash coming.   lows are being tested and lower resistance level should be tested again soon.. going down to $250 IMO
