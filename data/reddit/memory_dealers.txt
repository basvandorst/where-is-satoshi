If you find their twitter page they have a sticky for escalating support cases.  I did this and got a response in 4 days.  They were very friendly and helpful. 
Hope that helps. Good luck.

This isnt a get rich race or technology race, and if you feel that way, goto btc and join their protests and propaganda and throw your coins into their wishing well.  Foundation work, which takes time, is the key to success; not bigger Bandaids that work in the short term but only kick the can further down the road.  There are also large forces that slow progression purposely (ex Coinbase adoption of Segwit), in order to pump their own agendas..
