The more *addresses you use, the higher the fee.  
One address with plenty of deposits is still as small as you can get. 
In this case, 20 addresses were deposited to.

20 inputs charged by the byte = bigger transaction cost

Well, that sure shut him up.

Sounds like a complex and expensive system.
It sounds and acts like banking to me.
I got into BTC to take power away from banks.

The irony of posting censorship resistant as a feature on r/Bitcoin is delicious.  Come to think of it, all three were delicious.
Hope those fees and private layer-two scaling solutions work out for you!

And... you're banned.

Careful now, you're flirting with the realization that there's nothing specifically valuable to BTC....
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:51:25
Well, your censorship resistance point is falling a little short if the transaction fee costs more than what a majority of the planet makes in a day.
Is BTC only meant to be useful to wealthy nations?

Ok, but a permission-less, peer to peer, trustless system that relies on institutional channels is going to have way more friction than a system that doesn't.
 These second layers will rely on somebody to run them, they're going to want their pound of flesh for the privilege...

I mean, it's great when it's going up.
Past returns are not a promise of future returns.
Maybe Core and the banks can keep this bastardized version of Bitcoin headed towards the moon, but I lost my confidence in it being usable system last month.

I trust the original incentive structure and those who believe in it.
It was hi-jacked once and the centralized control there is truly horrible.
I do not equate running a node with any meaningful voting power on any chain.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:03:35
'Dude', I started mining in 2013, I understand Bitcoin just fine.
My point is that for every single user voting via node, major players can run 10 nodes of their own.  This is how groups of people wind up being organized.
Are you suggesting Core/Blockstream respect node and miner signaling?
Because I'm pretty 85-90% were signalling for an increase in block size....
You're going to get leadership of some form whatever camp you're in.  I'll take the camp that delivers a usable system, and I suspect the market will get there pretty quickly as well.

Except fiat has border controls, trace-ability via institutions, is subject to horrible monetary policy, varies country to country and can be printed at will.
Other than that, there might be similarities. I'm not convinced though.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:16:57
Not at all.
Everyone being able to transact is more important than everyone being able to maintain.

I will never have a sane conversation with someone who leads off with 'payments was never the point of crypto'.  That is asinine.
