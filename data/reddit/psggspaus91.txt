Bitcoin is beautiful.
It has gracefully earned its place forever in human history, 
A true champion of social innovation and technolgical enlightenment.
But one day the king will lay at rest and the fruits of its own labour will carry on its legacy.
To be gone but not forgotten.
Unlike the fate of the many others.

All I know is over the course of history a group of men got together and gave value to "something" and people adopted it. It can happen again, or not.

Hello, when I look for advice in regards to price this is what I actually do. I invision myself in a random place in 2040. I imagine picking up my future mobile device and googling 'BTC USD' and tapping search. Now at this point your brain will show you an imaginary figure on an imaginary screen from the future based off all the knowledge and experience you have today, your rational brain has to give you an insight and it will show you a number, you might miss the finer details but it is still clear enough to give you an accurate impression, your wet little brain will do this to make sense of the continuous scenario in mind you demanded it re-create. What figure do you get? 
Its beautiful isn't it.

"Our Belgian milk chocolate Bitcoins are made with world-renowned Callebaut® chocolate producing a very well balanced milk, cocoa and subtle caramel taste. Exceptional dark chocolate coins are available in gold or silver foil."
Wizard feels brave to confess this is a classic taste, bravo.

When I was little I thought it would be "cool" to set up for my best friend to be scared when he walked into my house, Once he was ambushed and scared he cried and said he never wanted to be my friend again, a week later I felt horrible and wanted to apologize for being a dick, however little did I know he had moved away days ago because his dad died of cancer. This past act has now fucked with me for decades.

This is intresting, When my computer is running I hash using oclvanitygen to find a collusion of a full btc address using my video card, my computer tells me estimated time is longer than the age of the universe, but in the same moment my computer could stubble across the address the second I run the program. It's a waste of energy but I do anyway because I pay for my power.

Once Coinbird hacked my hot wallet and swallowed all my BTC, word on the street is that he is now a big wise whale who stalks  Altcoin Bird &amp; friends. Long live CoinBird I fully respect your highness.
