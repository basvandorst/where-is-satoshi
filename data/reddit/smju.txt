You won't need to see it on cash registers, if it takes just 1% of the gold market, 1 Bitcoin will be valued at $5000. Look at the XTC vs XAU charts for 2015, I expect this to continue in 2016.  
Forget retail - that will come later. There is massive potential with just the "store of value" attribute of Bitcoin.

Am I right in thinking that under this proposal that if you initiate a transaction it'll be recognized providing there is an eventual winner in the longer term no matter who ends up validating the transaction (assuming the increased blocksize chain wins).
Whereas under the hardfork proposal you could potentially lose your transaction (or it end up on the losing chain) even if there is a winning chain further down the line.
If this is the case then it's genius!

So how will this work. If I initiate a transaction with the RBF flag will it then depend on whether it is processed by a node that hasn't opted out of RBF. How can I control what node processes the transaction?. 
If some nodes end up supporting RBF and some nodes don't what will happen in practise?  
@_date: 2016-01-04 10:24:04
Just a reminder to both sides of the block size debate.
It seems one side has compromised from 20MB to 8MB and now would be happy to support 2MB.
And the other side? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:14:35
so does that mean it'll be pretty random whether a replacement tx gets processed depending on which miner mines it.
I can see the advantages and disadvantages of RBF but surely a mixed deployment would be the worst of all worlds,  it would degrade zero-confirmations but not fully support the ability to unblock transactions.

I have a Sipp with AJ Bell although I'm sure other Sipp providers would do. I'm no expert but it's only a special fund in that it's listed on the Swedish Stock exchange rather than the UK one and it's a type of fund (i forget the exact name) rather than a stock. I asked them if it was possible and they sent me a form to sign saying I understood the investment. Once they accepted the form I was able to invest.

2015 was the year when the established banks began to embrace the block chain, the technology underpinning the currency bitcoin. The development was given the value of the virtual currency to rise again to the skies, which benefited throughout the growing bitcoinbranschen.
One of the companies that surfing on the rising interest is XBT Provider. The company is a sister company of the KNC Miner, which builds and operates data centers in Sweden, verifies bitcoin transactions and produce new bitcoin.
XBT Provider was the first to offer an exchange-traded certificates for those who want to invest directly in bitcoin, without having to turn to a special stock exchange. In practice, the certificates it is possible to speculate on the value of the virtual currency, in the same manner as in oil or gold.
Since its launch on May 18 last year, the value of bitcoin (and therefore the certificates value) increased by 90 percent, from 233 to 444 dollars.
The certificates are called ETN's (exchange trades note) and traded since October in both crowns or euros.
"It has gone well! Many days we have been the most traded ETN: one on the Nasdaq Nordic. And the one who was there from the start have seen their investment double in value. We believe the value of Bitcoin could double again in 2016, "said Alexander Marsh, CEO of XBT Provider.
According to him, more than 500 small investors and institutions invested in any of the two certificates "Bitcoin Tracker SEK" or "Bitcoin Tracker EUR" since its inception. The managed capital is about 85 million.
"It's a good start. But we hope that the managed assets will be 3-4 times higher at the end of this year, "said Alexander Marsh.
Technically speaking correlate the value of the certificates altogether with the value of bitcoin. The difference is that the XBT Provider charges a management fee of 2.5 percent per year.
"We hope to reduce this fee in the future as the brokerage costs fall on the established bitcoinbörserna" said Alexander Marsh.
He gives several explanations for the value of Bitcoin has risen during 2015th
"Among other things, the European Court said that bitcoin will be considered as a currency and are not subject to VAT. Furthermore, three new regulated bitcoinbörser registered in the US over the past three months. They are ITbit, Coinbase Exchange and Gemeni, started by the Winklevoss brothers. Total invested the world's venture capital company around a billion dollars in bitcoin-General in 2015, "he says.
The big hope now is that bitcoin block chain and technology should occupy a central position in the international currency transactions and transfers of other forms of securities.
"The strongest arbumentet for bitcoin is that the system can be used to make currency transaminase concentrations quick and inexpensive. The current system is quite obsolete. Companies like Western Union can take 10 percent for transfers to distant countries. While transfers in the west cost several percent, and often takes 3-4 days, "said Alexander Marsh.
XBT Provider is borne out by the Swedish bitcoinpionjären KNC Miner, which has already attracted investors Creandum, Accel Partners and GP Bullhound. The company had a turnover of SEK 640 million in 2014. The result was negative, SEK -30 million, for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Thanks - so what's to stop a miner pruning out all the transactions with no fees attached.
@_date: 2015-03-23 10:21:27
According to my understanding, Miners seem to occupy 2 functions, verifying transactions and mining for new bitcoins by solving the latest block puzzle. What is there to stop a miner trying to just mine for new bitcoins but not verifying transactions. How are the two functions of a miner interlinked?
