I've paid more than that in the past lol

I did send from Blockchain.info web wallet. The date on the transaction legit keeps changing everyday and this is getting very frustrating.

Shut up, Default fee is $0.50. I sent $1, what the fuck do you mean? Get off my thread if you're going to be useless.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:29:03
what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:21:18
Uh, that's *never* been an issue in the past. I normally even just let it do the default fee of like $0.50. I understand that normally when I do $1 it takes an hour or two, but 11 days?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:27:35
So essentially if I send another transaction of like $5 + $5 fee to 1PB5DKGCDBnVAkTms2BMLmfVCLBHjHx9YD they both will get accepted?

This is so frustrating...

No, it was not 5/19 and guess what, before today it said 5/14, they either keep updating the day or idk what's going on. The exact date was when I received my CS:GO Skin I paid for.
11 Days on the dot.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:32:47
Ya I sent it may 10th, thank you for finding that info!
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:02:26
Just tried that for 3 min as soon as the hour turned, nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:34:36
And it is 15 days, refer to my last post that nobody could help me with.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:43:31
Oh my fucking god, you legend. Can I kiss you?
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:41:11
But regardless, that shouldn't cause 11 day hold back and for them to ignore all my support tickets.
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:25:58
11 Days? When their support responds with "After 7 days if nobody has claimed it we will just return the money." lmfao, read the post please.

Thanks for even trying!!!!!
