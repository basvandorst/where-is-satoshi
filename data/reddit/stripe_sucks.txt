Would NOT recommend Stripe… I’ve recieved the message below from them. Stripe is currently holding our funds, does not reply to any messages indicating that we sell USED products and are not, and can not be, an authorized reseller of either Apple or “Playstation” (last we checked the company is called Sony) when you’re selling USED items. If you had to be an authorized reseller when dealing with used products then places like eBay would have very few sellers.
Hi Andre,
Thanks for signing up with Stripe! It seems like you’re reselling fairly popular brand name products, such as Apple adapters and Playstation controllers. In these instances, we need to ask for confirmation of your authorized reseller status for Apple and Playstation. Can you send us documentation that can confirm your reseller status? Sorry for the hassle — we know it’s frustrating when a few bad actors make it more difficult for legitimate businesses, but we will need to complete this step before we can transfer payments to your bank account.

If you think they won't screw with you when using Bitcoin, think again.
