Ditto. They just tweeted a while back with some server issue, saying all data is safe.

What are the exchanges  to buy in Kenya? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:56:04
sounds like equivalent to how we buy small quantities of bitcoin on cex.io via debit/credit cards ($300/day limit for non KYC users)

I am based in Delhi, the capital of India. I have had a lot of on ground talks with restaurants and cafes owners, post explaining to them how bitcoin works, and they seem to like only the cash/credit card way.the biggest hurdle they face is how to put the bitcoin in their accounting books and most of the legal advise they have is counter crypto. Unocoin is trying to provide pos machines which convert bitcoins to INR equivalent but then what's the point if you are going to pay INR 100 for a INR 100 coffee. 
Somebody Asked what's the Avg monthly salary of an Indian,  roughly INR 8000.

A lot of my friends called me in frenzy cause they made the mistake of keeping their coins in the exchange. It's a panic day today. Even the other exchange Coinsecure is down since two days. Govt has all the more reasons to make a case in point like, hey users we told u so that it ain't the right thing to go for bitcoins and it was at ur own risk. I totally buy your point, buy/sell at govt mandated ceilings.

10 years from now that kid will remember you like Robin Williams from Good Will Hunting

Absolutely true. Even in the books,  Digital Gold etc journalists have concluded the same.

The college educated millennial are better off. Their minimum salary starts with INR 30,000/ month.

Since 1950 till now we have lost the INR as equivalent as Re. 1/year to the usd. In 67 years of independence, $1=INR 67 as of this week.

No one is actually paying bitcoins. As per user data,  there are less than 10,00,000 people trading bitcoins via mobile our of a population of 1.4Billion. The only activity with what India is occupied is buy and sell as exchanges are marketing bitcoin as best investment vehicle, and systematic investment plans.

Absolutely agree. Unocoin and Zebpay are purely focused on pure advertising and tussle for customer acquisition. Both the exchanges are very poor in customer services. Furthermore, they are openly aligned to work with government and pro KYC and capital gains tax along with sharing sensitive customer data. Furthermore, Intraday trading has attracted upper ceilings per user on these exchanges. What was earlier INR 50,00,000/day to trade is coming down to INR 20,00,000/ and on certain days as low as INR 50,000/.

Golden words in summary!

My guess is almost 60% of them are getting cheated by ponzy schemes and chit funds which are very widespread in India. Just last week my dad, aged 68 and with no idea about crypto, was offered to invest in lite coins by a litecoin ceo in Delhi by getting in 8k rupees along with 2people. Youtube is full of insane ponzy schemes in hindi!

I have the same worries as bitcoin clears legal hurdles in India

Every year we lose to the dollar by 1-2 rupees, since the last 50years. Meaning yes  our currency is susceptible to constant inflation.

Just because of this Zebpay crossed a turnover of INR 1200 Crores for the financial year of 2016-17.

Well us usual with all wallets,  till u get a threshold customer Base of active users this strategy can work but then the payoffs fail once we start using it. This is how all the prepaid wallets in India such as Paytm(part of alibaba) or Mobiquik acquired large customer bases with cashbacks but now the dust has settled and there are no freebies.
