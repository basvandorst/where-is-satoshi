When they change to proof of stake in a year the inflation rate will be lower than it is for bitcoin

They have a food truck and restaurant in SF. Great Indian-Mexican fusion. Anyone know if the other locations accept bitcoin?

We are in a post bubble sell-off, which has been made worse by all the recent bad news about the ddos attack and transaction malleability problems. Will the price will probably dip below $500 before stabilizing and going back up.

I vote for Ⓑ

Looks like I was wrong about Mt. Gox. Already at $360. Wow!

There is still 4 and 1/2 hours left until the Japanese business day is over. We should see some sort of announcement soon.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:37:06
It's this, the KNC Miner Data Center.

I would rather Ⓑ

Because you expect the price to drop even lower and you want to buy the coins back at the bottom for a higher profit. Price will keep dropping until Monday, when withdrawals are announced then it will skyrocket past bitstamp and btc-e. Then the massive sell off from mt gox users will bring the price of bitcoins on bitstamp and btc-e down to around $400-$500.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:06:49
Yep, btc-e is down and Mt. Gox crashed below 480 temporarily. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 03:32:16
To avoid the confusion, I think we should change it to Ⓑ
