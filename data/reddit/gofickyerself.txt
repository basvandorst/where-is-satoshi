Every single fiat currency that has gone to zero has gone to zero.
Many haven't - they were either phased out (eg all the pre-Euro currencies) or are still in use (USD, GBP). You can say that they will all eventually go to zero, but bitcoin will eventually go to zero and be replaced, too.

Don't know about 'saving millions' but there should be a lot of efficiency improvement around security settlements. Right now if I buy stock it takes days (right?) before I actually have them.

I said low cost *to users*. It's free. You don't have to maintain the ledger, because the miners do it for you - for free!
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:20:45
Like all large settlements, there's a type of escrow / validation involved. Each party confirms that they can deliver their side of the trade: the buyer brings the money, and the seller brings the stock.
In the present system I believe there are still paper stock certificates. Some people need to give their broker a check which will be wired to some settlement account, and so on.
Again, this doesn't really solve this problem but it's a step towards a centralized ledger for a security.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:25:14
Centralized ledger would mean they *must* control the moments, and are solely responsible. This means that someone (anyone) could act as multisig party - if fact any security owner could choose their signatories, if they wanted, or just use Nasdaq for peace of mind.
This model allows a lot more flexibility. In what way is centralized 'more efficient'? It's more traditional, and not necessarily less efficient, but that's not really the right perspective.

@_date: 2015-05-13 13:10:56


The blockchain controls it. Simple. If I want Nasdaq to confirm before I transfer the security then I can so using multisig. I don't have to - I can just transfer it myself.
There are no "rollbacks", so at first Nasdaq *should* confirm everything, but they point is they don't have to.
The bitcoin ledger is complete, transparent, and directly peer-to-peer maintainable.


No more paper certificates, no broker holding your stocks awaiting your instruction. Reducing the settlement time as stated above. The ledger is the source of truth.


Traceable; no audit required. No "trust" necessary. No errors in Nasdaq software resulting in missing securities.


No (technical) need for a trusted third party to participate in the transaction; reduced compliance cost, flexible and customized approval/transfer workflows.
Centralized is more efficient from an energy usage scenario. There are other scenarios; centralized is not more efficient by default.

Yes, you can. You just don't give anyone the keys.

@_date: 2015-05-24 04:43:24
Man. You ought to think before you type. How much do you think it costs to mine a bitcoin? This discussion is about just a fraction of that cost.
Assuming it costs around $1000 to mine a bitcoin - it doesn't, but that's within an order of magnitude - then you could spend $10 a year for a million satoshi. That's 3000 per day, one for every 30 seconds of the day, 24/7.
If you have some important device that's continually communicating and signing things then $10 a year is negligible. 10c a year would still give you 10,000 satoshi; enough for one per hour.
If then application doesn't deliver value then it will never catch on, but some basic confirmation functionality for 10c a year seems pretty good to me.

That would be nice but unless there's some utility or value it's hard to use it for that purpose. Gold was an early money, so there's some cultural understanding that it could again serve that role.

Really? It's a known number - somewhere around 17m.
There's a huge disconnect here between the value being transferred through the network, value of that work (i.e. savings), and the "market cap". Each of these things are related but not in a direct or concrete way.
The amount of money that we can transfer through the network is a function of liquidity more than capitalization; it's a classic stock vs flow scenario. If liquidity sufficed I could transfer a billion dollars a day in bitcoin - 100 coins every second, or 360 000 BTC / $100m per hour. The network can support that with the current $300 price. The market cap (the stock) isn't directly related to the value of transactions (the flow).

What are you basing that 50% on?
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:31:53
The applicable example here is "capable of being trusted". Anyone who puts 90% of their wealth into bitcoin is definitely not trustworthy when it comes to judgement and decision making.
Of course he 'is responsible for his decisions'. His decisions were not responsible. He is but making responsible decisions.

Maybe not "addict", but betting everything on bitcoin is obviously gambling.
*At least* he could have diversified into Litecoin, etc. There's plenty of bitcoin related investments on Havelock.

I am. He can't trust his judgement with regards to money. That's the point.
If bitcoin works he'll be happy. If it doesn't, and in 10 years he has lost $100k+, do you think he's going to reflect back and think "that was a great idea"?

Yes. It's probably only worth half of the market cap.

The AV industry is interested in making sure people think they need AV. Blogs like these make money from people continuing to research this stuff.
Source: haven't used antivirus since Windows 7 and never had any problems.

No, you already lost it all when you bought and decided to hold.

Since forever.
I'm amazed that people still run antivirus. Usually the antivirus program with its popups, useless warnings, and *serious* performance drain ("system scan") is just as bad as the "virus". It's completely unnecessary unless you plan to download and run random .exe files.

Great use of the word "actually", stub nub.

The early commercialization of the internet was around porn.

Maybe you miss the point. If the justification for going all-in on bitcoin is that "if it goes big he'll be rich" he might as well buy lottery tickets.
If you really want to get rich from bitcoin in an "all-or-nothing" sense, get involved in the industry, create a bitcoin startup, do something proactive. Just dumping money on something so speculative is virtually gambling.

This guy? Probably nothing. People who are still tipping money in are not the early adopters who made a lot of money.

You just can't read a definition without adding your own spin to it. It's not rocket science.


Sure. But why did you add "with other people" to that sentence? I quite clearly referred to trust vis-à-vis managing money. 
Would *you* trust this guy to manage your money - " here, invest this the best way your see fit"? No - he doesn't demonstrate good judgement in that regard, and therefore has no evidence of trustworthiness. Given this, it's obvious that he is not *responsible* with regard to money management.
No one is saying he is untrustworthy or irresponsible in *general terms*, just wrt managing some investment. Because that's what this thread is about.

What's your point? Every idea that is called foolish is actually good?
Satoshi has a million bitcoins. This guy lost half of his net wealth in 12 months.

They are independent, single issue sites that purport to provide some insight or guidance on their topic is expertise. The more people who buy AV, the more interest in their site.
The fact that they are funded by antivirus companies just cements their part in the antivirus sales chain.
