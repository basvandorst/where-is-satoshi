I'm not interested in using Dwolla, but if what he said is true, does this mean the government may not take steps to crush bitcoin if it continues to grow, but will instead embrace and tax it? Because government intervention would seem to be a major concern for someone considering moving toward bitcoins at this point, no?

why are you valuing a bitcoin at $256?

i've been reading that mt. gox is "nearly always under ddos attack"
"Although Mt. Gox's exchange is nearly always under a DDoS attack, Gay-Bouchery said Wednesday's issues were not related to DDoS."

This is great food for thought. I knew there was a reason I came to r/bitcoin/new.
I think a lot of people look at Bitcoin through "changing the world" rose-colored glasses. They hate the banks, the finance industry and governmental control, and see Bitcoin as a way to break out of this, into some sort of "better world". This may or may not be an appropriate hope; I'm not sure. I think some sort of radical changes need to happen, clearly, given the current state of economies all around the world. Perhaps the changes that Bitcoin brings will "shake up" and break up some of the statusquo, and bring some progress. In fact, I think a lot of people on this sub would call that an extreme understatement.
But when you speak of "a critical mass of the richest of the rich" moving toward Bitcoin, because their current offshore tax havens are no longer safe (from central banks), it suggests to me a future Bitcoin-world that is perhaps free from government institutions and big banks, but still highly stratified - still rife with economic inequality, but instead of being full of corruption, now there simply aren't any institutions to corrupt. There would still be super-rich and very poor. Is there ample reason, in your view, for the not-rich to even cheer for Bitcoin? 
I'm gonna cut to the chase (I'm just following a strain of logic here) - Is it possible that a Bitcoin-run world would be the free-market libertarian capitalist's wildest dreams run amok? Our governments right now suck, and they are corrupt, but would Bitcoin simply make them all obsolete, and bring about a new global wild west where the rich are all powerful, and all the rules can be rewritten?
What do you see happening in terms of society, laws, power structures, ect. when (and if) Bitcoin totally takes over? (Sorry, not trying to sound super-heavy, just procrastinating at work.)

For me, the quickest, easiest, and most anonymous way was to use bitfloor.com (if you are in the US). You can deposit cash at any Bank of America branch, using their intermediary, which is called LocalTill. The bitfloor website explains and guides you through everything pretty well. The only downside is that there is a 2 or 3% fee to use LocalTill. But you're paying for the ease and anonymity.

No problem. It goes through really fast - I walked a few blocks to a BofA, deposited the cash, and when I got home and looked at my screen, bitfloor already had registered the $$ in my account.
You can transfer the money electronically, yes. Bitfloor actually allows P2P transfers from (free to set up) Capital One 360 checking accounts. You can also wire the money, but there's a $15 fee I believe.
