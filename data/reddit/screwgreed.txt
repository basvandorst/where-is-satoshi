This is what I hate about tipping, I'm not an active commenter, and I don't get tipped. These tips urges me to post a comment, but I have nothing to say because that's who I am. I'm a lurker, and whenever I see someone getting a bunch of tips for just being new here(see dstanchfield's $17 tip), it just piss me off. I might as well run a bot to post shit on the default subreddits for a month, come back here claiming that it was new to bitcoins, and collect all the free money(that all of you turned these 1's and 0's from the blockchain into a currency, and turn that into your nation's currency) from these generous show-offs and their spammy-ass bots.
These tipping bots should be banned, not just because I think it's a bitter reminder of how much I suck at getting tipped, but because it clutters up the dicussions. You waste one post to call a bot, and another post the bot made as a reciept. Reddit allows you to give gold membership easily, so why not not bitcoins to slience out the process, the reciepts belongs in the blockchain.
I don't have a tippping account so don't bother, If I had I wouldn't even bother donating because that's what murica and America has taught me. I tried to keep this bitch post of mine to myself, I just had to let myself express my steam. Welcome freakyfancy, I wish it was a warm welcome, but then I wouldn't be posting that.

Yeah, because the truth is that bitcoin isn't dangerous, and everyone that disagree with us is wrong herp derp, you have leveled up your ego skill, you gain 1 x bitcoin advert (better put it on talladega race)

Look everybody, I'm funny because I made a snarky comment. I'm so glad that I'm fueling this trainwreck.
