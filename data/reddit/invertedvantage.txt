What I guess I don't understand is...Mt.Gox always seemed to have problems. Even from day one it seemed shady. Why did people keep buying into it after numerous technical failings? Why not use one of the other, more secure and trustworthy exchanges?

Ah cool, thanks.

That reddit amuses me. It's 99% [FOR HIRE]

This was the reason I didn't get in with Mt.Gox when Bitcoin started, they got hacked as well. Are *any* of these sites secure, and am I compromising myself by using a Chase 360 account? I would rather go through another company than give my bank account info to any of these exchanges.

That's what I did, most of my investments were in at .25 increments and was $40. Now it's like $100.

Buy in small amounts on the trading markets. .25, .125, etc. Let it build over time.

Ah, so betting is a transaction, is it not?

The minimum amount you can buy on Coinbase is .1 Bitcoin, or $50.08. I don't know what Mt. Gox's policy is.

Wow that's slow. So does it purchase at the price I originally bought or at whatever price happens to be the most current on Wed?

Nothing fundamental has changed? Some people lost a ton of money. I would see that as a major change.

Hey man, just tried again and was able to buy .01. Get in there! I think the max this range will top out at is $100.

Why do you say that?
