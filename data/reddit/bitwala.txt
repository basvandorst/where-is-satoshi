Thanks for sharing your concerns. I won't give you the whole "but we are bound by regulators" rundown. Instead, two options to try out if you like our service and maybe decide later if you wanna go pro: If you use  you can send up to 200 Euro per transaction without signing up at all. If you sign up using only a name and email address, the limit is 500 Euro. Give it a try! :D

The backup can be restored independently of Bitwala. [Here's how to do it.](
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:10:32
That is not correct. The wallet is designed so that we actually could be hacked and you would still be able to retrieve your funds. When creating a wallet, you get a backup sheet that contains your encrypted keys. Decryption is done with the wallet password you choose. We never know or control neither your password nor your private key.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:41:08
You can already use Tether with Bitwala. You can use it to pay your bills, send international bank transfers and top up the Bitwala debit card. Start using it, and we can build on that.
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:21:54
Well, if you count Localbitcoins, maybe two. :D

How about the silver rule of Bitcoin: You own the keys, you control the flow of the Bitcoins? ;)
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:24:13
Not the case. The only way you can deposit money is putting Bitcoin in the Bitwala Bitcoin wallet, which we don't control or monitor in any way. For the purposes of paying a bill or toping up your card, we treat payments from the Bitwala Bitcoin wallet like any 3rd party wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:53:51
There's different ways to ensure the safety of your funds, this is the way we chose. And the users does in fact hold the private keys. Only the way the backup process is designed right now will make you transfer the funds to a new wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:37:09
It's good to have choices. Only in North Korea people have to use the same wallet. And you can see where that is leading.

That is not true, our exchange rate is the market rate without a hidden fee. Please better compare it with Bitstamp
@_date: 2016-04-19 14:12:26
Which country are you in? There are some countries we can't ship cards to because of legal implications. Those should be more or less the same for all debit card providers.

We’re creating a cryptocurrency-friendly banking infrastructure to allow users to enjoy a seamless transition between both economies. We’re taking the weight off users' shoulders so they no longer have to worry about bank account closures because of their crypto trading activity. 
Bitcoin is also baked into our DNA as the bank account is linked to an HD bitcoin wallet that is user controlled. The combination of all these features in one account will ensure you benefit from a genuinely fast trading process - not to be found elsewhere.

We offer a full banking service together with our German partner bank that merges the crypto and fiat worlds. Benefits are you'd get a German online bank account in which customers’ funds are also insured up to 100k by the deposit guarantee scheme of German banks, allows you to directly buy and sell bitcoin, make and receive payments and manage your finances all in one place.

Hey Uppe,
We understand that you’re upset are sorry for your experience.  However, the facts are as follows: 
1- To give you and our users the fairest and most transparent experience we guarantee the price of Bitcoin at the time of conversion. So if you would have topped up 0.5 BTC and the price fell down dramatically we would have still transferred the amount that you saw in the topping up instance. In addition, having weekend support does not solve the issue of agreeing to the price when it was set.
2- We have delivered up on our promise from our end as per our terms of service and processed the transaction within one business/banking day. Bitcoin surges or drops are in general difficult to predict and we don’t rely on nor benefit from either. 
Sincerely yours,
The Bitwala Team

Hey there, we have not published our fee structure yet. In the next few weeks, we'll be launching our new site where you can find our pricing. With the new site, you'll also get a better idea of the all-new Bitwala, where you'll see that the products and services we offer are rather different compared to the companies you have mentioned :)

Bitwala does not have access to the cryptocurrency in your wallet. You won’t ever “give” your crypto to us since we only offer multi-signature wallets that ensure that you are in total control of your funds.
4 million in funding doesn’t create a bank, but it goes a long way to develop products and hire the best people to develop an all-new exceptional banking experience.

Thank for the honest feedback, we are working constantly to provide a cheaper payment service and we will promise to deliver lower transactions fees. We are already working with the best market pricing available. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:21:03
Our service is convenient, private and fast (1 business day). 
You would use it because verification at an exchange, waiting for your funds or managing a bank account is not required anymore.

Is that a compliment or ...
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:10:25
We didn't got DDoSed. We didn't asked for any donation. Bitwala simply offers fee-free bank transfers for refugees customers. We actively support refugees with education about bitcoin, because it is almost impossible to get a bank account in Germany/EU without a resident address.
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:14:22
Thanks for the hint, we will continue to fasten the process and lower the transaction fees. The minimum fee is just for the launch to cover our intiate costs. May view it as a kind of support ;)

Hi, it highly depends on your perspective. At the moment we are clearly in a beta status to receive feedback like yours. Not every bitcoiner buys his bitcoins but e.g. mines or earns them. Instead of going through an exchange you can avoid wasting time, money on fees and the risk of identity theft.

Hi Jushe,

Bitwala's founders are deeply rooted within the crypto community and are amongst the very early adopters. Our product tries to build a bridge between the crypto world and the world of traditional banking, hoping to onboard more people into crypto and bring value to those who are already active in the space.
Working in the world of "traditional" banking entails adhering to the rules and regulations that are part of that world. Knowing about the nature of bitcoin, we apply the utmost amount of leniency, more than any other "normal" bank out there. Founders and employees have had bank accounts cancelled for using legitimately earned or mined crypto before. This means that we really have a thorough understanding of the problems of KYC and AML from both sides.
Our banking partner and Bitwala are putting a lot of effort into granting goodwill on edge cases. However, there are fraudulent or illegal funds being funnelled through crypto. Do not bring these funds to Bitwala.
We dedicate our time to examine each case rather than making quick decisions. Please understand that our investigations may take some time. Most of these measures you refer to are temporary, and we apologize for delays in processing.
As much as we value freedom of transaction, we also value the rights of victims and we will work with authorities to restore and return these funds. Your funds are safe with us, but we ourselves also need to protect ourselves and our customers from association with illicit activities. Different things are illegal in different jurisdictions. What's "illegal" might not be "immoral" and vice versa, and you may or may not agree on what constitutes "illicit".
Public outrage will not deter us from doing what is right within the confines of what is legal. We will therefore not be pushed into deciding what's illegal and what is not, we will adhere to the laws of the jurisdiction that we picked out with full intent - Germany. This also has perks - accountability, deposit insurance and a very high level of operational security.
We accept that those affected by ours' and our banking partners' decision may be irritated, and we are working hard to reduce the number of "false positives". However, we can and will not disclose details about singular cases on social media platforms like Reddit.
Yours sincerely,
Ben &amp; Jan
Co-Founders of Bitwala

Most of the banks in Germany need at least two business day to load your card. When you wire money from a bank account to another to the card and it is Friday it often takes until Tuesday. In total you need to four days to receive your funds. I am wondering what they are doing with the money in the meanwhile...

When and how they decide to jump out and get dry again? Must be sad time for banks seeing these card features popping up.

Dear kcamkcam, sorry but we need to correct this:
1. the verfication incl. level 3 for power users is mentioned and explained at our FAQ / help section and necessary if you want to transfer up to € 50k / month.
2. if you order the card with DHL express shipment it costs 70 EUR. A card shipped by standard delivery / snail mail costs just 2 EUR, you can't get this for a better price.

Yeah, thanks. This is true, we basically eliminated hidden fees and offer the best rates. The bitcoin exchange rate we offer is the mid market price from multiple exchanged without any hidden fees. We charge a simple and flat 0.5%, so probably Bitwala is the fastest way to cash out bitcoins in Europe. You will save money and time using the bitcoin prepaid card instead of exchanging bitcoins yourself on an exchange. Feel free to submit screenshot if you see a better rate

@_date: 2016-05-08 15:54:31
If you ever need a backup, bitwa.la offers Bitcoin to bank (mostly SEPA for now) payments as well and offers a Bitcoin debit card.
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:44:56
bitwa.la will be there as well, helping out and answering your questions!

The card that is issued by Visa is called a "Visa prepaid debit card". We do see the difference and did mention it in the comparison (under the names).
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:16:33
How many merchants will adopt a service that costs more than receiving Bitcoin directly? The problem is that merchants don't see the point because they don't get asked daily from customers that wish/demand to pay in Bitcoin. I don't know how a new card will change that if merchants have to set it up (signing contracts that need to be read) if they don't have the certainty that they will attract more business. The "Bitcoin Debit Cards" work with an exciting system that spans the globe. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:58:26
Sorry for that. The test shows a EURO card comparison. We will take that into consideration for the future!
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:31:24
Yes, their fee is 1.99%. "Load Fees Original Credit Load Fee Per transaction 1.99%" vs. 1.19% 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:11:37
Hey, I checked their fees for you. "We charge a 2% fee when loading funds"  plus the BTC to EUR spread of around: 1.00%. This means in total around 3.00% in fees.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:20:41
We will make a second round of card comparisons.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:54:55
Hey there,
We're sorry to hear that. We'll be happy to look into it right away. Please email us your transactions number on support 
We are usually very active on reddit but the best place to reach out is or our support channel.
Kind regards,

Please take a look at this article:  about how TenX takes 2% from any transaction "The company said it takes a 2% cut from each transaction"
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:37:30
We state how we made the test in detail and urge everybody to do the same to see how high the fees are.
"In our test, we compared the prices between the relevant providers and Bitstamp, an online Bitcoin and Altcoin exchange, to show how big the spread really is. Our comparison is only a snapshot of the exchange rates and therefore we can only show what the margins were at that time. We are not claiming that they are always the same and invite you to make your own comparison."
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:37:00
Hey, our cards are valid for 3 years at a time. I believe it is the same for all providers. Users that have no ID verification can withdraw €200/ day with a max. lifetime ATM withdrawal of €1000. Here you can found out in which countries our cards can be shipped to:  
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:44:11
We at Bitwala all love Bitcoin but we do think people should have the choice to use Bitcoin even if shops and institutions don't accept Bitcoin yet. With our "Bitcoin powered" Card you can!
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:25:47
Hey, yes the 3% conversion rate is the same with all providers.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:18:55
Hey there,
Rest assured that we are much faster than banks and also you can do transfers with a minimal 1% fee. 
We're happy to show you how to get started if you get in touch with our support team here 
Kind regards,
Bitwala Team

Well, we found out that Xapo is not giving users the best rate. They say that their fee is 0.00% but it is closer to 3.70%.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:53:12
I guess the next test will show how high the fees really are ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:15:49
No, but it doesn't take long to load a card with Bitcoin/ Euro. Normally only 15 minutes. So no need to plan too far ahead when buying high priced goods. 
Debit Card vs. Prepaid Card
"The question for me is who has direct access to my Bitcoin. Most Bitcoin Debit Cards are Prepaid Cards and that means the provider doesn't have access to my funds. I guess it is a question of safety vs. convenience" (from above)
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:03:13
What happens if Xapo is hacked and the hackers get direct access to your coins? What happens if the Bitcoin price falls (for a short time) and you want to "save" the price? I think to advantages and disadvantages for and against a prepaid or debit card are clear and users are in the happy situation to choose.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:17:41


Bitwala is at 1.19% fee and through shapeshift all cards can be topped with 40+ Altcoins
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:00:50
Thank you for your feedback. We do show all the info about which exchange was used (and at what time) to show the real fees. Furthermore, we do state that this is only a (random) one sample test and ask users to make their own tests, by comparison, the exchange rate they get from different providers. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:09:05
Our article is receiving a lot of downvotes. This is very unusual for us. Could this be a response from our competitors?

I checked them out and they have around 2.97% exchange rate fee "TOP UP ACCOUNT Bitcoin internal exchange rate". Tested in the same way as the rest.

@_date: 2017-06-19 13:19:46
Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback, we are happy to resolve that issue together and asap.
1. Yes, that is true. You are verified for a Bitwala account. However these limits (2000€) do only apply for bank transfer not for our VISA card as stated in our Help/FAQ section. There is a double check by VISA and the card issuer - you are having the contract and the funds with - for your identification documents which was rejected because of an outdated proof of address.
2. If you want to cancel a transaction, we can return your funds within 0-2 business days in EUR or BTC. It wasn't our purpose to hold your funds longer than necessary, we definitely are not interested in that as our business is to deliver asap. We are facilitating transactions automatically for 99%, unfortunately there was an exemption in your case.
3. The moment of the card order matters not the account creation, that is why we have to ask for updated document from time to time again. I agree this isn't a perfect process yet, therefore we are happy to receive a suggestion to improve that. We definitely consider to iterate based on your feedback.
Feel free to reach with actions points, however any private information you may rather send via our existing support ticket conversation.
Thanks a lot for your patience, we are happy to serve you and avoid these issues for anybody in the very near future.
Best regards,

Hi Dan, we are not available to US residents yet. Sorry and good luck finding a suitable solution. Cheers, Raphael 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:12:11
Good evening,
 
Thank you so much for writing to us we highly appreciated your honest feedback.
Our initial Level 1 policy was allowing to send 500 EUR per month in transfers and when you made your second transfer our policy was changed and now it’s allowed to transfer 200 EUR per month.
If you wish to transfer higher amounts we offer Level 2, for which you need to be verified and upload your ID Document and a Valid Proof of address. Once you are verified you will be able to transfer 2000 EUR per month.
Our SEPA transfer fees are 0,5% and please remember that you have to add the wallet fees which have been increasing during the year 2017 and which determine the speed of confirmation time for your bitcoin payment in the network.
Currently all our users are charged additional network costs on all EUR invoices to cover the cost of Unspent Transaction Outputs( UTXO), you can read more about them at the bottom of this page: 
You can adjust the network fee, we do offer an option for this. The fee depends on the number of incoming transactions to your wallet, if you have a lot you will pay more.
Please send to us your transaction ID in order to investigate the mentioned high fees.
We would like to make it up to you personally please get in touch with us via Support contact email:  support
Have a great weekend!
Best wishes,
Bitwala Team

Hi there,
Support is informed and we will proceed as you wish.

Hi Dan, if you are in Europe, the easiest way is with your very own Bitwala online bank account. With us, you hold your private keys and can cash out (and buy back in) your earned BTC and either transfer your fiat funds per SEPA transaction or cash out at the next ATM right away. Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:15:27
Exactly, Bitwala enables trading bitcoin with fast liquidity. The bought BTC amount is then transferred to your wallet and can be used without any limit while having access to your private keys.

Hi stefioan,
Thanks for reaching out, your honest feedback is highly appreciated. First of all, we are sorry for inconvenience, we are happy to explain what happened.
Your card limit is currently 2500 EUR because VISA hasn't accepted your identity verification yet. That is why you couldn't load your card yet more than that amount in total. Once your verification documents are accepted your card will be unblocked and you have unlimited usage in terms of life time load and POS transactions, only ATM withdrawals will be limited to 2 * 1000 EUR in 24 hours.
You received an email by us because you currently are unverified cardholder account with the card issuer. If you have submitted your documents to be verified, this means that your documents have been rejected by Visa. Following the EU’s Proposal to Amend Regulation 648/2012, known as the 4th Money Laundering Directive (4MLD), all unverified cardholders will have the following limits as of June 26th:
1. Total card balance on your physical or virtual prepaid card can not exceed 250 EUR at any time.
2. Cards can not be used to withdraw or pay more than 100 EUR per transaction.
3. Unverified accounts with total card balance over 250 EUR will be suspended until verification is complete.
The 4MLD regulation applies to all cryptocurrency and non-cryptocurrency card providers located within the EU. If your total card balance is below 250, you do not need to verify your account. However, we highly recommend all unverified cardholders to verify their accounts to avoid account suspension and interrupted card usage. If this happens, we are required to ask for additional documents to unfreeze your account. To avoid these limits, please verify your account using our guidelines at 
You are the only person in control of your funds and once verified, the limits will be significant higher to have no such experience. This could be due to your proof of address being older than 3 months days from date it was issued. We have already replied to your support tickets to request a more recent proof of address so that we can forward the new document to VISA and have them increase your limit so that the topup can go through and you can proceed transacting with these restriction.
Thanks for your patience and understanding, I am sure we can fix your issue ASAP.
Best regards,
Bitwala
