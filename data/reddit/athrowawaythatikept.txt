Nope. Thanks to you, I just learned that! No wonder they are not helping me. Paypal hates bitcoin right?  It would be nice if there was a bitcoin scam subreddit or a place where people could list the companies that scam or support fraud of bitcoin using their services.

I do care! I will look into filing a complaint. I was asking if you were familiar with the complaint filing process and if you thought it would be something the FBI would actually pursue?

She will probably only wear it to gatherings of close friends. I doubt she will wear it shopping or to a concert. Who knows though. She gets kinda crazy sometimes.

I have to agrre with this post! I also use a counterfeit pen to test the bills when I do an in-person trade. ;)

Thanks for info!

Thanks! Us "Bitcoiners" need to make it harder for the sammers and easy for new bitcoin users to know if something is safe or not! This post is a start on the latter.

I know that now. However, if you search Venmo's site, TOS and FAQ, there is nothing that indicates it is a scammers delight. If I can stop one more person from getting scammed, this post will be a success!

Any PIs reading this want a new case?

Good advise! I would probably do this for a large transfer over $5000 for instance. For transfers smaller than that, I accept cash and use the counterfeit detector pen and check for security features in the bills themselves.

Really? I lost $1200 (at the time). That is a lot of money for me, but I can't afford a PI. I don't think I can anyway. I have never priced their services. What is the FBI going to do about it? Is it a simple process to file a complaint? Will they really follow through on an investigation of a $1200 fraud case?

Do you have magical powers? If so, congrats! It seemed legitimate to me at the time with the information I had at the time. I have never been tricked into a scam like this before. I can tell you though, it really sucks when it happens.

She is a open minded girl!

I am sympathetic to them only because of the great communication I had with April (Fraud Dept. employee). I wouldn't call it sympathetic; it is more like I understand it is a problem they can't control. Their only income is generated when people use credit cards (they get 3%) and so if they crack down on that, they lose their business - literally. If the scammer had used a bank account as his funding, I would be getting my money. Venmo doesn't do charge backs, but the credit card companies people use to signup with Venmo can and do! It is definitely not clear in Venmo's FAQ, TOS or anywhere on their website for that matter. April indicated that they should make the charge back possibility more visible on their site. However, then they risk scaring away customers.  I am frustrated that they won't refund my money (not even a part of it). They said that most likely, the scammer stole someone’s CC and setup a Venmo account using that. The charge backs will come from the credit card company and not Venmo.

From FBI website online complaint form, "Please use this website to report suspected terrorism or criminal activity. Your information will be reviewed promptly by an FBI special agent or a professional staff member. Due to the high volume of information that we receive, we are unable to reply to every submission; however, we appreciate the information that you have provided."  
Seems like I would be pissing into the wind with them. However, I am going to notify Venmo about my intentions and then submit a complaint anyway. Thanks for your suggestion. If enough of us do it.....

This is how you recoup your investment. Get your wife a shirt like this.

Venmo.com It is similar to dwolla.

You just saved yourself from a scam! Thanks for turning me onto the WOT rating system!
