Nope. That was me commenting on someone referring to "CNN" as trash. CCN it's actuate for.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:08:31
If CNN is trash, I really don't wanna think about what that makes fox news

it is an example, just a bad one.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:02:59
's anti-spam patch set would be an example, but that wasnt in core itself, just a patch for the gentoo distrubited bitcoin core.

There will almost certainly be a blacklist, the problem is will sellers tag their wares properly.

And Russian.
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:40:30
Than we would have reddit, part of the problem is there is no central authority, every thing is based on web of trust, it should (I'm not a programmer) be fairly simple to have suggested tags, the more times a tag is suggested, the more likely it is to be accurate.

Who pays for the interconnections? A "pure" mesh is inherently slower and messier than one using supernodes, plus you can stick better interconnects on those stationary supernodes (something like a RONJA, or ubiquiti airfiber) while having superior connectivity locally.
As for libre? For the most part yes, we aren't quite to the point where we can go blobless, it won't affect most people day to day.

Isn't that the same guy who wrote the gambling censor patch for bitcoin-core and included it into gentoo by default? 
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:45:09
Oh certainly, when any amount of something resembling censorship shows up though I get worried, and that's part of the reason I'm watching Gaven's proposed fork.
And what in your mind differentiates spam from poor dust collection or some odd transaction intended to foul taint analysis?

 My ~~friend~~ acquaintance DMCA would like to talk with you
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:05:41
Before this how many have heard of it? Imo it's therefor "more secret". 
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:26:29
[Ahem]( 
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:07:09
True, I was treating them as a spectrum between "well known" and "secret" anything towards the "secret" end of the spectrum would be "more secret". And let's not forget Vice's only purpose is to sell add space/copy.
Edit: word choice.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:00:54
Well in that case have you heard of [CJDNS](  [I2P](  or [AnoNet]( 
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:03:23
SL (most likely someone from legal leaned on someone with publish access, IMO) went back and edited the git history to make it seem like the trezor firmware was reliscenced back in August with an extremely restrictive licence, forbidding **any** modification to the source, even if those mods are not shared. 
Clear as mud? 
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:22:36
The problem isn't that the patch was written, it's how it was passed off and set to be included by default. He has my respect simply for being a maintainer, something I have neither the expertise or patience to do. Even great men make mistakes, they are not judged by a single action, but by the overall course they take and where that takes them. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:06:33
Then we are are almost back to square 1, you are still centralized on the old infrastructure.
Blobless in this case refers to [binary blobs](  most hardware in use today needs proprietary firmware to run, so those systems even if the is it self is all FOSS cannot be considered libre, even if you don't need additional blobs in the form of drivers. For instance [olpc still needs them]( 
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:24:50
one thing i think people are missing is this gives up a more or less common HW wallet, don't like their firmware? use Trezor official. wanna roll your own? have at it. far from decreasing Trezors' value, this arguably increases it. we now have a second unit that should behave identically, so testing either without destroying them is now feasible and practical.
that said, they really should put up sources, its just the gentlemanly think to do and would really help with [gongkai]( and producing other wallets and keyholders.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:59:40
Np, glad I could help

Still need a gate way of some sort, otherwise no one will get your transaction
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:07:05
Only half a joke, mods cannot edit comments, they can remove or hide them, but not alter them.
In this case a connect was hidden/removed because it sparked a brigade, and states he intends to restore it as soon as the furor dies down.
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:39:17
He can't edit it, he's not @_date: 2017-08-20 17:28:42
Figured, just linked it to prove the point. I really need to look at the sat details.
If it is actually a Ka or Ku band sat, then unless it is in geo, not gonna be a lot of use with out a tracker, and those are what gets pricy fast.  
Edit: yep, three satellites, that's geo for sure.  Heck at those data rates you could fit in multiple and old chain data too

 perhaps $150 Inc shipping. Heck with an rtlsdr, an rpi zero,  a down converter, and antenna you could be in business pdq. Of course that still leaves how to get a transaction on the network, but as others have pointed out there are many ways to do that.

Ehh, your paying less in parts, but you are going to put more man-hours in set up.

Can't mods manually approve comments from shadowbanned users?
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:01:41
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:23:35
If shadowbanned, then their account still exists and they can post. How ever, their posts/account will not be visable to anyone else without moderator intervention.
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:37:59
Then you missed the point.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:33:24


If they are shadowbanned, that is what you will see. They can still post, but without a moderator approving the post/comment (or automod set to do that) then no one will see your posts/comments.
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:30:57
Then you won't care if your wife finds out about your porn subscription, or the lingerie you bought for your side chick.
You won't care when your work let's you go for a patreon sub, or Facebook tells your friendlist that you just had a bikini wax.
The problem is it's a slippery slope, and when misinformation is so easy to spread, then what?

all LCDs do, often times its a design feature, then there are also filters that reduce that to straight ahead.
you are also assuming the camera watching you has sufficient resolution to see the screen if its a a close enough angle. granted there is a lot of post processing that can be done on poor quality stills, but there are ways to defeat that.
edit: how often are you going to get a shot of &lt;=45 degrees any way?
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:35:14
Depends on view angle of screen, off angle you can see where finger lands. 
Assuming standard layout, you can reconstruct the pin with high confidence. With randomised? Good luck.
