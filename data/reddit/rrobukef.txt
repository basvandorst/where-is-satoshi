The price difference is a signal of risk, inefficiency and hidden costs. Imagine two islands that buy and sell salt. These are two communities with different needs thus the supply and demand can subtly drift apart. Merchants balance the prices by ferrying but these are expensive, slow and if the delivery is too slow the prices can have swung the other way leaving you with overpriced salt or overpriced money and the merchant loses.

Tldr: let them live they serve as a reminder to improve bitcoin
Alternatives fill a niche - real or imaginary - that Bitcoin can't fill. Their most important value will be stability of price. They will follow basic economic principles where all coins will find a balance according to their relative utility with a race to maximize their value. 
True clones can become pegged in a bout of sustained irrationality until they slowly die by one black swan after another. However if adding features reduces value upsets could occur.

Exchanges must register as money transmitter businesses. 
This implies that the exchanges must have a confirmed identity before they can do business (Know Your Client, KYC (1)) and they must be registered.
 Since the "anonymous" client must do business with them they will be known, must be known. Thus they cannot be anonymous.  (BTC-E is not anonymous)
Since they only hold the funds of other people they just provide a simple layer on top of exchanges. Exchanges will compete and will have a lower fee. (They will call it "mobile instant conversion" or somthing) Thus the company is not solvable. 
They could be anonymous: you can depend only on an anonymous exchange, but then you need to hold the funds in a cryptocurrency, and again with the large volatility. This also doesn't stop the exchange from providing the same service with lower fees.

It's good research, but I don't think Bitcoins are the correct solution. The main product banks sell (loans and investments) is not suited for anonymous trust. 
You need to be able to pressure a *person* if he doesn't pay his loans, not an identity. For investments the bank has the option to keep your money. You need to be able to pressure a bank to return *your* money and not just keep others away by reputation. This would require you to break your anonymity. 
As such Bitcoin has too much cryptographic overhead that is unneeded by banks. Also, since they are centralised, they don't have a condition races, or forks. They don't need mining. 
Also for payroll you don't want anonymity/pseudonymity, you want secrecy from your peers. Peers who judge you, who you interact physically. 
Thus banks don't need the two key improvements of Bitcoin. There are however other people smarter than me, and lots of other applications that could be useful to recreate with trusted peer to peer transactions.

Provided your hackerspace trusts you, you could run one bitcoin node in a DMZ.
All bitcoin traffic from the hackerspace to the DMZ and from the DMZ(the one node) to the internet is allowed.
All bitcoin traffic from the hackerspace to the internet will be disallowed (or severely throttled).
The only thing remaining is advertising the node: when starting the bitcoin-qt client a parameter addnode must be added as argument or in the configuration file. You could hang a poster.
The only attack vector is a DDOS, but that is already the case :D. Otherwise you can't spoof the blockchain on your own since the difficulty is too high. And people would experience weirdness when connecting to independent internet connections.
If they don't trust you, BitCoin will continue working and downloading, but they will need to find some other trustworthy source to connect with and check the data they downloaded. They will keep the data downloaded from the local node.
The throttling seems the best solution for me then, you don't block the complete network and just discourage downloading from the other nodes.

No, there are varying degrees of randomness: the distribution. Which can be evaluated by finding the entropy of numbers generated by the given distribution. (Entropy has a *very* fuzzy definition as soon as you stray from uniform distributions)
The sentence "the private key is perfectly random like that" should probably be read as:
    
    The distribution of the generated private keys is statistically indistinguishable from the uniform distribution (given what we know about SHA-256).
This is clearly not as sexy.
On one hand you're right: the search space is drastically reduced. On the other hand, in my opinion, the search space is not reduced anywhere near any unsafe level.

Other article :).
The problem isn't calculating 2^n calculations in a single step. The problem is reading them in a meaningful way. Suppose you have 2 qubits they are in a superposition of |01&gt;/sqrt(2) and |10&gt;/sqrt(2). The chances of measuring either state 1/2 each. But you can't predict which you will get, you can't choose which you will get. But when you measure one of the qubits the superposed state will collapse to either 1*|01&gt; or 1*|10&gt;. And the other qubit will also be determined.
Now I'm going to factor a number, we know the multiplication of the number is 1. However we don't know any other information so we try to do all calculations at the same time with a quantum computer.
We start with a superposed state |000&gt; |010&gt; |100&gt; |110&gt;. Each has an amplitude of 1/2, the sum of the squares is 1, each has a chance of 1/4th to collapse to if we measure the first two qubits. If we measure the third qubit the system does not collapse.
Now we do a multiplication of the first 2 qubits and store it in the third. (Since the inital state of the 3rd qubit is known, we don't loose any information, quatum states have a conservation of information law)
We get the superposition of |000&gt; |010&gt; |100&gt; |111&gt;. 
Great our system found a quantum state where the multiplication is 1. However we don't know what the superposition is, it hasn't collapsed yet so now we must measure it.
If we measure the third qubit we have a chance 1/4th of it collapsing to |111&gt;. If we measure the first then the third also, second then third, first then second, they all collapse with chance 1/4th to the interesting state. 
This isn't good, because we will need to do 4 calculations on average before the correct state is measured. We didn't gain anything :(. It's exactly the same as brute forcing it.
This is why we need Shor's algorithm to factor a number. It does something special with Fourier transformations such that the interesting state has a greater amplitude when it is measured. With this state we get a hint. And with enough hints we can factor something faster. We still need to run Shor's algorithm a number of times (80? 100?) before we actually have a decent chance to find it. (Which is much better than 2^80).
Same with Grover's algorithm: If we would implement a SHA256 function and measure the outputs we would get a random inverse (exactly 1/2^256 chance). We could do this with the same complexity by brute force. The trick is getting an interesting inverse: like one with leading zero's or an exact match. However the best algorithm does so in O(sqrt(N)) time instead of O(N) time. For SHA-256 this means 2^128 time instead of 2^256 time.(on average 2^128/2 and 2^256/2). This means you need a hash rate of 255 GQH/s to get a 51% attack instead of a 65 PH/s.

Yes, the internet is the main cause of the current globalisation. The current blocktime would be too short. A block time of 10 minutes is useless, a blocktime of several hours would fit better. A transaction confirmation time will go up from 6 blocks, 1 hour to several days. Due to non negligible communication costs miners will pay a large fee for connectivity. [IP over avian carriers]( will handle connectivity. There will be centralisation in the form of Bitcoin offices, like post offices.
On the upside, storage costs are low, there will not be any blocksize limit.

So I'm going to try to reduce your argument to a lot of inconsistencies. (And I won't change this sentence after I completed my post)
By your argument you don't own money? You own a note that represents a certain value. You own a bank account that, by law says you own this much money. And thus this is what makes dollars a currency. 
But you still own the money, it is still a property. Currency then is a form of property that the IRS considers special for some (I suppose logical) reason. Thus for Bitcoin to be a currency the information you hold should at least be considered property. (Part 1, part 2 to is proving that the IRS exercises it's right to consider Bitcoin *not* a currency)
Next up: Bitcoin information represents property. This is wrong. Bitcoin information represents *value*. It doesn't represent any property. Also Bitcoin information *is* property. You have possess a specific number, one in 2^256 - y. This number gives you access to something of value (this is the closest I can go with your argument here, and even that is straining the analogy). But you can never own what the Bitcoin information represents: you cannot take your access and hold it for yourself. It doesn't represent any property.
Following argument, from your original post: Property is only something with inherent value. Why? You still own trash. It even has a negative value, you need to pay to get rid of it. Property we *want* to own has a value (inherent, personal, by consensus).  We exchange property when we derive some sort of gain from it (natural gain, monetary, theological/filosophical).
Now part 2: It's the IRS' own choice how they categorize Bitcoin: solely as a property or as a currency. They have their reasons for not accepting Bitcoin as a currency. Right now they have the sole discretion to decide. If you want to change this, start a lobby for senate.
P.S. In my opinion I succeeded in pointing out some inconsistencies in your reasoning. I'm open to discuss this more.

How would this lead to the thieves? It's useless if they use a tumbler. It's useless to follow the money back more than 2 steps back. People won't care enough. You need some sort of incentive. I don't care enough about some random thief, he's not a threat to Bitcoin. He's a threat to "everybody" but that's what OPSEC is for. Not some impossible impossibly convoluted scheme.
You're implying about some sort of official police investigation. Which can be done using the existing means, the blockchain is fully public. You can track all the money. Why would you still need to color the coins. Why would anyone want to see if their coins were once stolen and help? Why would anyone want to say who bought the sex toy/illegal software/anonymous coffee?
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:51:47
I knew that's an expression. But consider this:
Assume a very skewed distribution for the a priori teamsize P(A): A larger chance for one person(20%), a large chance for two people(10%), and some other distribution for more than two people (Let's take U(2,32)). This is for general projects, the specific distribution for the BitCoin project will probably lean to less active people than average and the initial design more likely to one person. 
Assume a geometric distirbution for the survival chance of the team P(B|A): the more people the less likely the secret is kept. Lets set the average at 10 people. When there are more than 6 persons (the median) there is a 50% chance they can't be discovered by somebody looking for them.
The adjusted distribution created by the experiment is then: 
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/(sum over p : P(B|A=p)P(A=p))
By this argument the chance of a one-person team is: 
    P(A=1|B) P(B) = sum_p (P(A=1,B=p)) = P(A=1,B=1)
    = 20%*10% / (20%*10%+10%*9%+1/30*P(A&gt;2))
    = 35.71%
Now for the logistics: Satoshi made a lot of consistent posts. All in the same style, without spelling errors. Some in slang, that is consistent. etc. (Citation needed, found this on a reddit thread). Let's assign a weight of 60% to this information: There is 60% chance that the consistency indicated a single person, there is 40% chance that it's still a team.
Next information: coding style. I take this independent since faking coding style is a lot harder. You are not only constrained by syntax and grammer but also by the execution. They also live a lot longer: even after 70% rewrite his fingerprint is still visible. There are also a lot more commits and coding samples available, since no inconsistencies are detected this should get a greater weight. Let's take 75% that this is a single person.
Next argument: paranoia. Satoshi is an entity that clearly wants to stay hidden. He/She/They also know about crypto and basic security. They know about internet culture and the ease to assume a pseudonym. Let's say an 80% chance of not making this very basic stupidly elementary error. I think it should be at least 95%. 
Current tally in wolfram alpha: 
    0.2*0.1*0.75*0.6*0.8/(0.20*0.10*0.75*0.6*0.8+0.10*0.09*0.25*0.4*0.2+0.2*0.4*0.25*1/30*P(X+1&gt;2) where X = geometric(1/10)))
    = 0.909
Leftover arguments: the timezone is estimated in the UK. This is about 8 hours from the US. It would be very hard to organize a team in the US to consistently work at night without their family knowing. I'm too lazy to works this out.
And I even didn't have to fudge any numbers. I also think each assumption is an underestimate against my hypothesis. 
Yes they are all bullshit, that's the point of a Bayesian analysis. But when you put them in numbers, and consistently underestimate and you still get a decent result it works very well.
This is only the first part, with this information we can start on the Dorian is not Satoshi analysis. But the experiment would prove that almost conclusive on it's own.

Yep, the bitcoin community is small. This means that there is a core of users which are vocal enough AND aren't drowned in the other noise that they have a very real extremist influence. 
Combine this with the general sentiment against the traditional economy created by the crash and the very real risk of money they move other people. 
The unknown CEO brings something new and exciting and will probably fail. But he will get his 5 minutes of cult fame. Maybe the net value of the system will go up a little bit more than expected.

I feel sorry for your nickname :/ You should honor it by being more irrational!
What if everything got 1000 times as big? One meter becomes one kilometer, all the constants scale: light moves 3*10^9km/s, 9.81m/s^2 -&gt; 9.81km/s^2. Conclusion: nothing happens.
21 million, trillion or 21 units would have scaled the block reward (and other parameters) accordingly. The difference in scarcity is measured on how the relation is. There is a finite number of blocks: that makes it scarce by default. There is a payout until 2020/2030? Which makes it slow. Another is logarithmic payout: constantly growing but each time less and less. Linear payout, exponential payout. 
As for the guy who mined 1000BTC. Yay he's now worth $600000 if he didn't yet cash out. At most he had 1.2 million. This is a far cry away from Mark Zuckerberg ($17M), Bill Gates (68M). $1.2M is a lot, but it's not enough to retire. He was lucky BitCoin took off. There was about a 99.999% chance (my estimation) this experiment would have failed. The $600 desktop would not have paid out on average. 
There award is for keeping the system alive for 2 years while it gained adoption. One day of mining and it failed, one serious bug and it failed, not enough media and it failed. 
BitCoin is by definition not a ponzi scheme since the goal is not making money, it is a system which generates subjective value. The risks are great, the rewards currently balance this out (and only just for the whole network). 
Go ahead change it to 21B BitCoins. How do you want to do this? 
1) Rename mBTC to BTC. Everything becomes 1000 times as big, but nothing really changes. It worked wonders in Germany and certain African countries. However one bitcoin is just as heavy as 1000 bitcoins or 1 satoshi. (Dilbert jokes excluded)
2) After the final halving you add more rewards until 21B BitCoins are created. You will need to convince people that this really really is better. And since the block reward should not go up. You are just extending the inflation period of BitCoin, this again doesn't really change anything but all scales.
3) You start your own network. If 21B is better people will use it. Keep in mind however that by 1 it really is just the same. Or you could change the full block generation payout scheme, which would be different but just another AltCoin.
4) You have some other magic way that changes the number without destabilizing the BitCoin economy. Keep in mind that deflating the value of BitCoins itself will not be adopted by the users that already have invested. Every change is met with great resistance, and that there is a democratic decision power. Destabilize enough or don't back your arguments up with facts and they will just ignore you.

Bitcoin is not the platform to do this with. The question has been asked before, I can't find the post. Bitcoin has design features that are not compatible with microtransactions and games.
* Bitcoin is slow, games are fast.  Waiting 10 minutes for the first confirmation is too long. Maybe for something slow paced like Tribal Wars or Team Fortress 2 hats. 
* Bitcoin has a complete blockchain. This costs money, it needs to be there. Microtransactions are too small and numerous to work effectively. Too much transactioncosts would need to be paid. 
The better solution would be either a centralised ledger owned by the game-maker with the option to cash in or out. This has drawbacks in case of servershutdown. But this also has positives like fraud protection (which is nice when dealing with minors). 
Another better solution is a side-chain. Not much is known, this is completely theoretical. A faster blockchain could help, but keep in mind that Bitcoin does not have millions of daily users. Bitcoin couldn't even support a WoW market right now (2.8 million daily trades). A decentralised ledger would probably buckle under the strain of crypto.

Investors don't want this because trade secrets. Public ledgers leak too much metadata, and anonymized ledgers are harder to audit. Also not everything has a cryptographic proof.
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:05:32
But checkpoints are in the eye of the beholder. They are not trustless. If a government made a $-coin that has periodic consolidated checkpoints, signed by the government, a lot of people would accept this as good. 
However this still goes against the design principles of Bitcoin. (The foundation is lazy and doesn't want to periodically sign something or seed the ledger, they are programmers after all).
EDIT: Also the current checkpoints are useless and expired from the first moment they are created. They serve to lock down to blockchain against a basic, ad-hoc attack. And fails spectacularilty at that. (It also protects against DDOS attacks)
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:33:05
1) Yes, the protocol is decent and holds no extreme surprises. The biggest challenge is probably the state of the Bitcoin-qt code and the lack of documentation. Version 0.9 improved this a lot. 
2) The cryptology is standard and widely used. It coupled it's security to bigger targets. The use of these components by bitcoin is sufficiently checked by cryptologists. 
3) When the codebase of the qt-wallet stabilises I would like a finer control over the way transactions are built. I don't like the hidden keypool or the badly automatic funds selector.

A Bitcoin key is information. Information has inherent value, but only the value of general consensus.

Java with spongycastle. 
SHA256 isn't the problem. The elliptic curve crypto to find the public key is very heavy.
By using the full library (BouncyCastle) instead of the small library (SpongyCastle) I went from 150 ECC multiplications per second to 550 ECC multiplications per second. ECC is slow (99% of the CPU time of the program), maybe on GPU but I can't do that :(.

It is theoretically possible to do mutual merged mining. Practically it will be a fiasco. Both protocols need to be updated, it will result in a hard fork on both chains. The advantage of using scrypt as a hash function for litecoin (THE main difference) will be lost. The difficulty difference between SHA256 and scrypt means a balancing decision must be made.
Socially no person in "power" (with enough trust in the cryptoworld) can and will push for this because of the outrage. Litecoin users don't want to use SHA256 because of the ASICs superior hashrate. Bitcoin users won't appreciate the slight increase of difficulty: either it's not enough to prevent 51% attacks or the Bitcoin difficulty will go up more and they will lose money.
TLDR: Yes, but the gains are marginal and you'll have everybody against you.

No, a quantum bit doesn't double the computing power. And the difficulty to create a quantum system is determined by the number of gates.
There are precious few algorithms that make a quantum computer faster than classical computing. And they only need the quantumness of the system. 
The number of q-bits needed is determined by the problem and the algorithm. For a general SHA256 this will mean one input block (assuming SHA256 is a bijection). For Bitcoin this will mean the size of one Bitcoin block header.
The number of gates is determined by the problem: you need to execute SHA256 in a quantum way. This means using the Turing complete gates. This is at least 20K gates to 40K gates. 
Note that using a number of gates makes the problem exponentially hard, because a quantum state is inherently unstable and the longer the harder it is to maintain it. 
The discrete log problem however is more vulnerable because the number of gates is lower. It will be faesible to implement it in a laboratory much faster. 
Successful quantum computers will give plenty of warning. The NSA isn't just going to fund a secret computer much faster than the whole world. Physics is hard and doesn't listen to money...Even if the public academia is 5 years behind that will be plenty to see a very slow emergence of quantum computers.

Next problem: Bitcoin is not designed to handle this amount of transactions. The cryptographic data needed for mincrotransactions outweights the cost of the bandwidth. It would cost more transactionfees than payments.

EDIT: Mining will be safe. 
To actually attack the mining algorithm you need a lot more gates: Grover's algorithm is inherently serial in a quantum environment, this means that not only the time complexity is O(sqrt(N)) but also the number of gates. (Since no loops exist in a quantum system). This can never be done in less than 10 minutes using current technology, with Moore's law and a large number of physical breakthroughs. 
Number of qubits needed for a single quantum SHA-256 implementation:
For a basic direct implementation, without loop unrolling, time-memory tradeoffs etc.
    Input:
        Bitcoin Header: 81*8 = 648
        Padding: 376
    Temporary words: 8*32 maybe more?
    SHA state: 2048*2
    Total: at least 5376 qubits.
    Number of gates: at least 15329 gates
The number of gates found here and with memory tradeoffs: [source](
This means that either the number of qubits will be larger or the number of gates.
The biggest problem is that bitcoin doesn't just rely on the security that SHA-256 is irreversible. Which has a time complexity of sqrt(2^256). But also on the speed of SHA-256 with the number of leading zeros during mining. Anyone having a quantum computer has a quadratic speedup compared to classical computing. Any Moore's law for quantum computing means that for every doubling of quantum speed, classical computing will become 4 times slower. A quantum computer that can search 255 GH/s can do a 51% attack on the current blockchain of 65PH/s
This means that however "safe" any hash function is against pre-image attacks, the blockchain will be unequally divided when the hash function is feasible with a private quantum computer at a decent speed.

First you create a private key: PK
From this you can calculate a public key: Pub = f(PK)
And to use less space we create a shorter address(which can be safely ignore for now): Addr = g(Pub)
When we take a transaction T: this includes the public keys used.
We calculate a number: h = Hash(T)
And we encrypt the number with the private key (sign it): s = Enc(h, PK)
By construction is the decryption of the signature the original number: h = Dec(s, Pub)
Everybody who gets the transaction can calculate the hash and decrypt the signature: if they match this is OK. h = Dec(s, Pub)
An enemy cannot change the parts of the transaction we care about: every change of origin, destination, funds or public keys will change the number h to h'. These changes will invalidate the signature. h' =/= Dec(s, Pub). They cannot create a valid signature for you because they don't have the private key.
Thus any information you make public is either valid and unchanged, or invalid and ignore.
Addendum: Addresses: when we send btc to an address we say to everyone: only release this money to someone who has the right public key. A transaction is only valid if: the address matches the public key and the signature is correct. Now it is impossible use another public key because the address won't match and it again is impossible to change the rest of the transaction.

There is a protocol that could be used to prove he's not Satoshi:
* Publish a date &amp; time for a rendez-vous. Dorian goes to the police at the same time for one hour.
* The police create a public statement that Satoshi and publish this. Do this with multiple channels if you want to increase confidence. Hell use twitter and add a word that needs to be removed before hashing like a captcha...
* Satoshi signs the statement and publishes it. His public keys are known and can be checked before Dorian leaves.
Two possibilities remain: Dorian is not Satoshi, or Dorian has an accomplice. 
My estimate would be 90% for the not-the-same-person since 2 people can share a secret when one is dead. Also the added complexity doesn't weigh against Occam's razor.
Combined with my prior's of Dorian=Satoshi already not being very likely in my opinion (the journalist suffers from a enormous confirmation bias and ignores details that don't add up). I think Dorian is not Satoshi with a chance of about 95-99%

Indeed he already owned it. But he was willing to spend electricity on minig. Lets's use this site, found via google:  and this site: 
Assuming 20Mh/s (my current i7 CPU with 8 cores), with a difficulty of January 28 2011 which was 22012. And a exchange rate of 1$/BTC and 50 BTC/block. Assuming a power consumption of 250 W. He would have made 0.01$ per day. 
Conclusion, he didn't do this for the guaranteed ponzi money. At best he could hope that this would be a good investment if this ever took off. He probably just thought, this is weird software, lets try this. 1.2M is also an upper bound. 10000 BTC were paid for one pizza at some time.
No, nobody would accept devaluing the currency they use. An american senator couldn't even suggest this as a joke between friends. China does this to attract capital and investors. And the only way this is possible is by oppressing the people, strict taxes and border checks, yada yada. 
What does BitCoin need to not be a ponzi? 
Does it need a governing body? Does it need large official backing (something like a multinational or a country)? These would only reduce the volatility, they don't change the concept. 
Does it need a use, does it need to have value beyond the speculation and investment? Yes, what's more: it needs to have more value than the competition. However I think (and a lot of others) that there is more value than just speculation and that value is greater than the competition. The value of speculation is only possible because BitCoin is getting established and growing. It couldn't have got here without having some added value. 
As for the added value? Fast large transactions, full control of funds. Basic security by obscurity (full anonymization with ZeroCoin). Hard to block globally and available where unblocked. No tax yet :D. An account costs your time to set up (I have time that isn't worth anything so this is cheaper). An interesting protocol and cryptographic design(meta). 
These are all subjective values, for some facebook is worth nothing, or it even has a negative value (employers for example). However the combined subjective value of ALL investors in BitCoin is currently somewhere around $600/BTC.

The only source I can find is 2Gbps as commercial internet at 51$/month. Man that's cheap, TIL...
But you still need a connection of &gt; 100Gbps to have a reliable peer to peer network. The assumptions are: 10 second block propagation time, 20 connected nodes, a small world with average diameter ~10. This means that a block will propagate to most nodes in about 2 minutes. (In my opinion these assumptions are a big underestimation, a small world holds to a power law and would need a lot more than 20 nodes.)
Maybe we should stop this hypothetical discussion. This situation is not going to happen anyways. In my opinion, assuming this article, a global single Bitcoin currency is not possible with the current technology and infrastructure. At the same time the internet and Bitcoin will grow at about the same time.

Its a pretty big protocol change. 
There is no network mechanism right now to identify SPV or full nodes (I could be very wrong, I havent looked at any new code &gt;0.8.x)
Another problem is that a reindex is pretty much impossible. If the client ever crashes the pruned data must  be redownloaded to recreate the pending transactions. (Or you need to store, in a safe place!!, the pruning height/checkpoint, which is impossible when you have malware.
EDIT: malware could completely rewrite bitcoin-qt, so that's pretty much a non issue, I don't know what I was thinking this morning. reindexing is still possible if you do some magic with checkpoints (you can only spend unexisting(pruned) outputs before the last checkpoint.

Investigating what? Bitcoin is designed to be reasonably anonymous.
"Yeah, I got this transaction by selling something online." -- Now what?
Also as previously stated: what do you do with partial funds? 1 tainted + 9 untainted = 0.1 taint each? This leaves tumblers open. All tainted? "Yeah I'm not accepting this 1 BTC because it was once part of a wallet that contained 0.001 stolen BTC.", nobody is going to do this.

Upgrading is forced otherwise older client's can't join the network without connecting to an explicit full node.
It could however be done in two steps: first create the necessary network protocol and in a later version allow pruning. Which would guarantee the majority has adopted the network rules.
Another problem is that this doesn't solve the initial blockchain download that OP so desperately wants to solve. This only solves the storage of an SPV node. Another question remains: can you download the pruned blocks and trust them? What happens if you upload a block with pruned unspent transaction outputs? Is this a DDOS waiting to happen? Can this be solved without searching the full chain or even REDOWNLOADING the full chain?

[NoUpload]( is the best example of a DA Corp. I've stumbled upon so far. It provides a service (a temporary server) to the world without any interaction. The prices are regulated with respect to the competition (like Amazon, ...) and to the unique service they provide: no signup, no waiting time. The service is as anonymous as it wants to be for both parties. Competition is free, anybody can start the same or a similar service by spending the needed resources. 
More complex DAC's can be build on top of this DAC. Automatic software could be build to reside in these services if the interface were to be abstracted. Automatic management of resources can be provided. etc.

No, they can't be made tiny without compromising any security. They are about the smallest possible. 
It's even worse, to create a healthy network you would need a lot more than just a large bandwidth: you need to verify and propagate the best block at a decent rate ~ 10 seconds per block. This will need a better CPU or even GPU signature checking and a large upgrade in bandwidth: let's talk at least an increase of 120 (so that a single block can be sent in half a second) and let's say 20 nodes for a permanent node. That's 100Gb/s...

There are two ways to decrease the reward gradually: linear and exponential. They probably wanted to keep it simple and have exact division, no fractional block reward, no rounding. This leaves two simple options: linear decreasing or division by 2 (or 4, 8, 16, ...).
For some reason they thought exponential decrease is better. Probably because it encourages early adoption: mine first when the blockreward is higher. It will halve soon! As opposed to start mining, the reward will decrease by 1 BTC...
Halving is also more easily explained (the formulas to calculate the sum is more difficult however)
Other exponentially decreasing schemes without rounding errors are possible, but way more complex: alternating between 3/4 and 2/3 or something.

Which means the US treasury could implement this (and any other government)
Maybe a registered bank could also do this. 
You will need to change the following functions: when someone buys digital dollars the bank will need to create coins on the blockchain. When someone converts to paper the coins must be destroyed. This is the only way to fully couple the digital coin to the USD. 
Coin mining: there could be a reward for mining blocks and supporting the network. However since the central entity fully controls the supply (by design &amp; necessity) these rewards will be less: you can't leech a greater reward from all people like what happens with the current BTC inflation. Mining will essentially be automatically outsourcing the security and run costs of the network. EDIT: Banks need conservation of money, Treasury could control any inflation.
Another approach could be a new block signing algorithm. A block is only valid when signed by the bank, no brute-forcing a O(n) algorithm. This means that any double-spending power remains with the bank but the transactions can be as fast, or as slow as chosen. This would be a fully transparant bank with limited pseudonymity.

The problem could be redefined as "find a bit pattern of length m that monotonically decreases in n steps from 10* to 010* as uniformily as possible"
Now we need to define any metric for smoothness and we could make the curve arbitrary slow.
For example: {10, 01} is division by 2, {100, 011, 010} is division by 3/4 and 2/3 alternating. {1000, 0111, 0110, 0101, 0100} is {7/8, 6/7, 5/6, 4/5} = {0.875, 0.857143, 0.833333, 0.8} ~ 0.8409

Bad article. ECDSA is much weaker than SHA256. There are contingencies known to academics to solve this, yet the article never mentions these.
The complexity if breaking SHA256 will be reduced to 2^128 instead of 2^256. This is an enormous speedup, but there will be plenty of warning before quantum computers become fast enough to process this.
ECDSA however is screwed because of Shor's algorithm. The complexity of a discrete log is reduced from exponential tome to polynomial time. Theft of funds stored in any address that already has a signed transaction (a public address) will be very vulnerable.

Sorry for the late answer. Real life :(
But you can buy keys that have a pattern: 1Bitcoin... These have no value if no bitcoin is assigned to them by your reasoning. Also every shop is based on the sole idea of buying and selling something. When a shop gets a delivery it is temporary property of the shop. And the only reason they buy it is so that they can sell it.
If you expand your definition to anything "somebody" would ever want to own, well... let's just say that there are a lot of weird people, including the first bitcoin fanatics. They created something that had no value, a very low expected value and maybe could never be exchanged with some else.
Also I would argue that the only reason anyone would ever buy something that they can't sell is because of it's inherent value. I tried to reduce your definition to something equally simple.

The scale of Bitcoins is indeed a bit unfortunate. But I think this is because of the digital nature. There is no base one BTC like you have one dollar that forces everyone to adhere to the standard. A lack of friction that makes it harder to estimate the final value and creates a bit more volatility.
The label µBTC could indeed be changed, but in my opinion it should change to something original that can't be confused. (And is easy to type, unlike the Baht symbol and the other new Bitcoin symbol, we don't have enough power to force this change)

And there are also other ways to combat the stickyness. I probably missed some. Also note that all these are bad for either the workforce, the company. 
* Rehiring: students, graduates. Have no experience, costs short term money for training. (Bad for workforce, risk for company)
* Increase the prices of the product: just keep selling the marzipan at the previous price. You won't go bankrupt at once. (I hope) Local market prices != global market prices. (Bad for company, risk for company)
* Bonuses, the invisible paycut: christmas bonus, company car, ...  (Bad for the workforce, but sometimes neccesary!)
* Efficiency &amp; innovation: More work in less time. Robots (risk for workforce)
The problem is also made worse by unions: they encourage the stickyness issue because their income depends on it. The also organize strikes to boycott companies that are shrinking. They change the game from "lets keep as much employees as possible and grow again" to "if you fire these people we will take you and the others down with them". 
So far reasonable arguments (in my opinion), now for some opinions that are less reasonable: Unions should have disappeared or shrunk when workforce protection laws (? probably named differently) came into effect.

The easiest argument against is an argument of contradiction. However it doesn't give any new information. (I'll make another post)
If each qubit doubles the power of a quantum computer, a quantum computer can be created that solves a specific instance of a NP-complete problem of length n with a polynomial number of qubits in a polynomial time. This is exponentially faster than classical computers (assuming P != NP).
However  clearly shows that BQP (the complexity class of a quantum computer with n qubits) is assumed to be disjunct with NP-complete problems.
Either wikipedia is wrong or you know something the rest of the world doesn't (please share it has a million dollar award).

Ooh, lot's and lot's of ideas, nice. A few have been discussed in other posts. If it was that easy, Bitcoin would have used it before they created the genesis block.
MyriadCoin is not a solution. They even open themselves up for an attack. The economic principles will rule the difficulty and balance themselves relative to their hashing power. This is the basic idea. But then everybody will mine only the profitable algorithms each time. Without any inertia (I guess they hope the network will provide this) the next rebalancing the difficulty may drop catastrophically. People will need to keep mining on all algorithms and not just the cheapest.
If the inertia is large enough, the attack is more difficult: it's reduced to a 51% attack. First the economics: the relative difficulty of each algorithm will balance around the relative cost of a single (mega-)hash. If the cheapest SHA256 ASIC gives 10TH/$ and the cheapest scrypt GPU gives 10MH/$. The difficulties will balance around 10T : 10M = 1M:1.
They need a *difficulty power* of 51%: this means that a group finds 51% of all the blocks. Combining the hashes/s and the difficulty gives you the average number of blocks found per s. If the sum over the 5 algorithms is more than 51% the average blocktime you have a monopoly. This means that each algorithm needs to find about 10.1% of the blocks, which is 51% of the hashing power of THAT algorithm.
However this doesn't stop anyone from operating 5 subpools as one like GHash.IO.
Proof of stake has limited power, either it votes automatically for the receiver of a transaction when the transaction is included, or it requires constant manual oversight to give the owners of the stake the possibility to stop a double spend. The second option however requires constant manual intervention and leaves the possibility to play multiple stakes against eachother.
To incentivise a full node you need oracles: you need some way to verify that the real world matches the simulated world. This is Ethereum's domain, Bitcoin should stay out of it. For now Bitcoin contains no feasible way to incorporate this. 
Proof of stake currently has it's own design problems. I think we shouldn't build off a halfbaked, untested idea (currently with known unresolved attacks). Engineering is rife with ideas that *seem* like a good idea.

C++/Boost/OpenSSL/BerkeleyDB/QT4 are technologies that not rare and very highly correlated. Boost and Berkeley DB are very popular libraries. Qt4 is one in maybe 3 cross platform GUI libraries. OpenSSL is as far as I know the only decent crypto library. 
PGP is less popular but still, mostly programmers use this and almost all know this. This is also a bad discriminator, especially since the creator of bitcoin probably would have learned PGP specially to develop bitcoin. 
The specific mentioning of crypto and GPU stuff are less easily explained. But still used enough, not really obscure.

No you just need again 51% of the hashrate, balanced over the 5 different algorithms regarding their difficulty.
Suppose you have 3 algorithms (A,B,C). The difficulty of the three is balanced in such a way that A, B and C find each 1/3 of all the blocks. Suppose A is easier than B and C to create ASICS and cost-benefit (Electricity/MH) then the difficulty of A will rise accordingly.
So now you buy gear in such a way that your gains are optimised. These are "simple" economy equations based on game theory. You buy gear so that the total income over time is maximal assuming such and such a progression. A simple framework is calculating the expected stable state using the known or short-term predicted possibilities.
In our example the costs are as follows: 0.5/1/1 €/MH (A is twice as cheap as B and C). The gear that will be bought is: 2/1/1 MH. For every MH of C we buy one MH of B and two MH of A. 
This is long-term optimal, everybody will do this and the network will converge to this "cheapest" state. Now they create 5 pools, since they are a better poolhost: the largest, cheapest, easiers, most trustworthy(?) ... A lot of people will use them according to the ratio that is optimal. They will again get a 51% attack, just using multiple hardware.

Power and currency wars do exist. Bitcoin isn't in them (yet). 
To know how interested the world is in attacking Bitcoin? The great firewall of china doesn't yet block the blockchain even after it's made illegal. Russia: the ban is never enforced and starts to be reverted. Europe: no laws, no talk about regulation.
America: banks block Bitcoin companies just to cover their asses and reduce their risk, just like legal marijuana dealers. They could harrass bitcoin startups by closing unrelated accounts (they have the rights). They don't fight back with lobbying (we'd have seen more than one senator calling for a ban). They could even interpret the existing laws and bully Bitcoin.
Every economist is saying stay away because of the risks. They have even stopped calling it a ponzi scheme and grouping it with other scams. Bitcoin is getting serious attention and recognition. 
No war yet, no harrassment yet. But the day it starts slowly is the day Bitcoin's existence is validated.

I don't think that this is applicable here. In your case the passwords were memorized and trained. I know for sure that I have a certain rhythm when I type, but this doesn't mean that you can predict what I'm going to type.
Theoretically his idea is sound. A very long string is quasi impossible to crack. If we assume that a human has an entropy of about 1/10 'pure' random. Where I use random in the sense that the generated information cannot be compressed more than statistically negligent chance. And the human creates information that can be compressed up to 10x. This means that a human needs to create about 10x the amount of information before anything is secure. (Note that the entropy goes down further when using a human language, which is structured in words and sentences)
On the other hand: you need to use a program anyway, you need to enter your private key in the computer to calculate the public address. The RNG is not the weakest link. The computer itself is the weakest link. You need to use an offline brainwallet generator, or else you take risks of spying, and try to take an open source one so you can at least do a cursory check. Dice, brainwallets or regular wallets are all sufficiently safe, if and only if you take the necessary precautions. And then regular wallets are the least hassle, why would you use something else.

Applications of SHA-256 are SSL and other secure protocols. It is also one of the few official certified hashes for the american government (FBI, NSA, ...).
If SHA256 is broken (solvable faster than using all the energy of the universe), any website using SHA256 needs to update their website (certificate, the green thing in the url bar). There are a lot of contingencies but it will be worse than the recent heartbleed bug.
One of the contingencies is the new hashing algorithm Keccak and others. These are currently being certified.
Edit: For example the certificates of both facebook and google use SHA256. And would be weak to any attacks until they changed the hash to something else.

Who will pay? I don't know what a fiber optic connection costs, but it won't be cheap. Do you expect that a 1000$/month connection *just* to run a full node? (For reference, Verizon FiOS is 500Mb/s at 400$/month and an unknown data cap of 4, 10, 15TB or unlimited, far away from 100Gb/s needed). This is not an investment that a regular user can and will make. Maybe a serious miner, most probably a mining pool. Byebye getworktemplate...
Let's talk total volume: assuming 10000 full nodes, the current aim, assuming 15TB/month, this would amount to 150 PB/month. The current prediction of total volume of the internet until 2018:  I don't think the internet could support the Bitcoin network, even with fiber optics. (Unless, of course, you create your own fiber network??)
A full NAT node at 46Mb/s is equally impossible right now. A data cap of at least 15TB? A stable connection of 50Mb/s? Let's see how technology journalists fare, which should be in the upper 90% quartile:  Enough americans that can't get a better connection. What will we do.

Not all servers have the same exact time. Generally in P2P systems the time must allow some drift and needs occasional synchronisation. Satoshi coded a version that accepts blocks where different servers/pools have different times.
Once upon a time the extranonce field didn't yet exist in the Coinbase transaction. And the nonce itself was only 32-bits, which is, on average, not enough to find a hash with a difficulty &gt; 32 bits.
People began messing with the timefield as this was an approximation of the real time, which added to the problem.

For point 1) see other responses: you only provide the public part of the key so that others can identify you. 
For point 2) I feel that the other responses lack some explanation. You sign a transaction. This is done by creating a number from all the information so far: origin(s), destination(s), fund division and public keys. This number has the property that (so far) nobody can change any part of the transaction without changing that number. Now you can encrypt this number with the private key. This is the signature. 
Now everybody who changes any part of the transaction will change the expected signature and since they don't have access to the private key they cannot sign it properly.

The bigger problem is now the solvability in my eyes. Such a service can easily be incorporated in an exchange with much lower fees. Also this scheme only works when everybody submits its prices in EUR or USD. Otherwise you're just running a front for an exchange.
The next problem: at what price do you accept incoming transactions? When is the the transaction good enough to convert to EUR, immediately! But when: when it is unconfirmed, when it was added to a block, when it has 6 confirmations? How do you choose without making the user angry?

Almost none: The blockchain can be made public without any fears. The worst that can happen is data-mining (Which the public, sadly, doesn't really fear) and an efficient police system (which is a catchall for politicians). This would mean more transparancy for banks and easier audits, even parts of the audits happen automatically. 
Another advantage is the deployment and scalability. Compared to COBOL systems running in a lot of banks this would be a huge improvement. It is easy to distribute the core over multiple servers, load balancing is easy and automatical. 
Next advantage: lower costs: less security measures need to be taken because some trust is transferred to mathematics. The servers don't need to be fully secure: the block signing can happen in secured hardware but only to prevent double spends (only with the second signing algorithm, default needs no protection). The bank is prevented from stealing any money from someone, bugs are rare and easily detectable. 
I don't know any internals from banking, but a bit more mathematics would do wonders for accountability, auditability, and security...

Currently the block propagation takes about 40 seconds to reach 95% of the nodes. Assuming a Small World model means that currently blocks are transferred at a rate of about 5~8 seconds. 
The next problem is that full nodes don't have a incentive to operate. It costs hardware, storage space, bandwidth (money) to operate a full node and no rewards (but the intangible "health" of the network). If this happens (I estimate p&lt;&lt;0.01) Bitcoin will cap out at a certain value and grow even more centralized to mining pools. Since they DO have an incentive to operate large full nodes. 
Also note that the article used a node with 3048 connections. A full node currently aims for 200 connections. This means that the estimate of 20 nodes was very conservative.
Locking in opens yourself up for a DDOS attack, which, in combination with a selfish mine could really be awful.

There's no way to prevent cash fraud by banks. Real money can always "disappear". Some work needs to be done to secure this against banks while we're at it. The serial number on a bill could be used as a token. However transferring tokens in a blockchain would be too computationally expensive. I'm not creative enough to find an object satisfying the following criteria: cheap (thus non-electronic) and digitally uncopyable.
Another method that could be used is small machines that contain a hardware private key. The machine can be used to store and withdraw funds from it to a bank account or to another machine. These machines are unforgeable, they can be used to check the blockchain quickly to find the current value of a machine and they can be transferred in person. Giving them to a bank invalidates them, getting them from the bank re-validates them. The mandatory(!) public blockchain can be used to check any fraud from the bank.
Think of them as mobile bank accounts or reprintable money. They come in 2 formats: fixed currency 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 USD or variable currency which can sign transactions to move funds in and out.

* For a tree of depth n: add qubits for each subtree that doesn't contain the coinbase. This will take O(n) qubits. This will be a lot of extra qubits. Shuffling isn't needed. This will also need significant advances in quantum computing to support this.

How are you going to trust the initial download? There is one chain of increasing difficulty starting from the very first. 
You need to prove to a newcomer, that the consolidated ledger is correct and secure without reducing any security. However if you cut off the history before it is consolidated you always lose all proof of work security that went into creating that part. This security is more important than the double spending since ALL wallets in the entire chain history are affected, not just the recent ones (last 6 blocks). It is even more important than the 25 BTC payout that has a 50 block waiting period before spending. 
I like to think, and got a solution to your question
TLDR: It's not worth it to expand the protocol in such a way.
There is a possibility to maybe sacrifice some acceptable security for reduced size by creating a special rule that periodically creates a hash of the consolidated ledger by the view of the head on that chain in a deterministic way (when build from the originpoint or when build from any other consolidated ledger). This hash must be unique and the same for every client that evaluates this hash. This hash will be difficult to create since the constraints are great and very exact.
When a block is additionally only accepted if this hash is correct. (This is why the hash must be deterministic and start from an arbitrary ledger)
Some time after, for example 2016 blocks later, this hash becomes valid. This means that the consolidated ledger can be used as a starting point for clients and it is valid to only offer this ledger as full history. You could create full bitcoin nodes that offer this ledger as initial download (4 GB, 20% of current size (estimate from unspent/total transactions April 2012)). For better security one can offer an older ledger, more history = more work = more security. However note that the ledgers are not compatible, you need to download at least one full ledger and all history from that point. If you connect to 8 nodes with 8 different ledgers, you need to choose one node to download the full ledger from. This doesn't support the network very well, and the upload isn't spread to multiple nodes. 
It all comes down to trust: do you trust some else to sign a partial ledger and say it's legit? "good for you, Bitcoin doesn't want to". Do you want to give up some security for the very cheap data storage? Lightweight wallets solve this problem easier, faster and cheaper. 
Also note that the price of datastorage goes down faster than the speed the blockchain can grow. Though the exponential decrease seems to have stopped ( and update)

No, they state that if you deposit BTC from outside Canada you can only withdraw if you are a Canadian citizen. The wording leaves the following interpretations: you can register an account and all money that is deposited in BTC can be withdrawn in BTC without verification.
You can deposit BTC from inside Canada and withdraw it to inside Canada. 
The wording is not clear.

What encryption do you use as back-end? AES? RSA? Some combination? RC4? ROT13?
Make a program available to create the keystream to decrypt the wallet file. You can check and you don't know the password (if you're secure against chosen plaintext attack).
Since you seem the official Blockchain account: Provide also at least a PGP public key or wrapped encryption program so that users can securily send their keystream. Create a https website (meh, better than nothing) that can submit the encrypted stream. Don't ask them to send it by email.
It still open you up to viewing ALL private keys. But at least you have a concern less.

If we try a permutation that doesn't pass the WIF then we know the permutation is wrong. This just takes a double SHA-256 calculation which is orders of magnitute faster than creating the public key.
If the WIF is valid, we still need to check the public key to know we're correct. However we have only 1/2^32 such cases on average.

He'd have decreased the size of the utxo set with the same amount with 1 transaction. He did however increase the full blockchain with ~8kB instead of ~2kB? Depending on the number of intermediate transaction outputs.

No, miners are professional, they calculated beforehand whether it's mining is going to be solvent or not.

Note that the software of banks and Bitcoin are completely different. Every Bitcoin transaction must be cryptographically signed and multiple outputs. Every transaction must be readable at all times.
For a bank a single line: a transaction happened from X at Y, to Z. And the balances of both X and Z is changed. (More complex, special code is used so that no transactions are half executed or money is lost)
The amount of storage is much less, a single backed-up server can be used. Bitcoin needs ~6000 full nodes, these have a full backup of ALL transactions at any moment. Bitcoin has a ~10000 memory trade-off for the P2P distributed and trustless nature.
The same costs can be counted for CPU-time: the electricity costs for Bitcoin are many magnitudes bigger than 10/100/1000 piddly widdly servers.
Banks will keep existing, they have a much much smaller overhead than the blockchain.

Assuming a currently small margin for mining (difficulty vs price is stable). 
A sudden decrease in price by a factor 35 reduces the hashrate by 35, 97% of the mining rigs will be shut down. And the difficulty stabilizes at a point where majority attacks are very much a possibility.
However the adjustment period takes 2 weeks at least. If the hashrate immediately decreases we have a worst case of 6hours per block and 70 weeks until difficulty readjustment.

No, it's not economically viable to buy and run a miner at this point. Running a miner would be a faith based risk. The cost of electricity will be 20 times the reward until Bitcoin recovers. The miner market is saturated and extremily cheap because there is both no demand and too much supply at the same time. 


Bitcoin is only stable as long as double spend risk is not a practical concern. Pushing Bitcoin to 20$ and holding it there makes it practical.


As big as Bitcoin is right now? For the lulz.
@_date: 2016-11-06 22:57:30
Nope: 97% of the mining rigs are eventually decommissioned. To recoup losses they will be sold cheaply. The cost of running a double spend attack is mainly startup cost, the operation does not need to run 24/7. 
Bitcoin is vulnerable and cannot be trusted, the price falls further, Bitcoin is DEAD.
Any significant (1/3, 1/4, or less) AND long-term (1 year+?, 3 years?) decrease in price kills Bitcoin. However it's also exponentially unlikely for this to happen.

What if you check all headers with an additional Merkle tree of the UXTO set and fully check N-10,000. The work is the same for both the header chain only or the the full blockchain. And if you have the power to split an N-10,000 chain, you already have the power to double-spend massively. No need to start the UXTO set at an arbitrary state.
For the really paranoid you can go N-20,000 and double the time to create a split chain. Or do the full N and have multiply the time by a C (assuming an exponential increase of hashrate) or N (assuming a linear increase).
But ... it's now a bit late in the Bitcoin develoment environment to make this big a change. If it's really necessary you could do a hard-fork, or you could create an alt-coin and let market forces decide.
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:40:56
I don't agree with your report. It is too short for this audience and doesn't include enough references to the basics of your field. You assume too much background knowledge. 
Secondly, your conclusion and summary depend on your appendix. You say that your features correctly distinguish between the people and identify similar people. There is no example of this, you could have chosen two accounts and shown that they have similar comments. Your appendix is the main result you have and it is not expanded a lot. You clearly missed a lot of necessary information (from the confusion generated on this thread)
5e6 pairs are not that much, this is much less than the computation wall you normally hit. It should only take about an hour, at most a day if you forgot to include the complexity of two features of arbitrary length or if they have a very large constant... It is also trivially parallelizable.
'Since the classifier was shown to recover at most 25% of all sock-puppet instances'. How do you know it's at most this value? Are there any confirmed cases? Did you ask the moderators? Did you analyse a random subset of your list?
And next up: the assumptions. These are personal comments, not problems with your analysis. I simply don't agree with them. Your assumptions are:
* Similar syntax, similar grammar, similar words.
* We don't look at trivially subvertable features. (known beforehand)
* At least 10 comments on before a user is taken into consideration
My problem with the first assumption is that it - in my opinion - is not indicative of sock puppets. It is an indication that the users have a similar language. It creates a network between people with similar or contradictory views. Additionally several large reddit commentors will have strong connections with other smaller redditors since they are trend-setters. Others will take the arguments and syntax of the big ones. This is to be expected in a specialized subreddit, with a highly specific jargon, like You didn't control for this. This means that you get a very high rate of false positive, as evidenced by the number of bad predictions. 
The second assumption is also bad because people are lazy, they don't have much time, it takes too much work to time different posts when you're online. You have to sleep and you can't react when you sleep. Secondly, since your report is published, your analysis is now also trivially subvertable. It was beforehand, because when people use puppets the first thing they think about is how do I change my appearance? Making spelling mistakes is probably the most obvious way possible.
The third assumption filters new accounts, filters the accounts that are generated as 'noobs'. These accounts could be designed to inflame the discusson 'Why is so and so bad?'. Oh, no response? , let's try again. Puppet accounts are probably not created a long time before the large discussions. And it's not like you can buy accounts that were active on with similar view to your own. And the other way is investing in multiple accounts over a long time ... but people are lazy. 
I find that your assumptions are too heavyhanded for the current playing field. Manipulation is not common yet, no indicators of puppets have been found. You are playing on a meta-level too high. And there is other low-hanging fruit, which you don't have access to like the common down-vote brigades on reddit.

However there are ways around: force mining in the official client, tokens in natura (these are cheaper from a business perspective), keep a centralized server that can push 
transactions trough at will.

Quantum computing is not reversible. At some point you have to do a measurement and then your superposition collapses. Then the energy dissipates.
Additionally this does not say anything about the time it takes to compute this. Every bit changed has a delta t. 2^128 steps is a LOOONG time.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:47:20
Technically there are 2 public keys for every private key. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-30 09:29:52
The fact that it's reversible does not mean that you don't need energy to do the operations. It means that you can get the energy back. It's like lifting a rock, it takes energy to go up, but you can mostly get it back. 
However if you add a generator on a rope to your rock, you loose all that energy. The measurement takes some energy, but it also destroys all the energy (&amp; information, Maxwell's demon). (I use destroy as 'to render useless', 'to convert to heat')
Bruce Schneier calculates the energy requirements for physical systems, quantum physics is still physical enough.
You're right about the conclusion &amp; arguments. But having two right conclusions both supporting that quantum computers can't break Bitcoin hashes DOES validate my argument, twice. 
(Quantum computers can break public/private keypairs when they have been used to do a transaction. If you have the public key in a raw unhashed form)

Any distributed system needs an incentive for the security and stability. This can be a monetary or ANY other incentive. They can be magical internet points for all I care. As long as the incentive is great enough to attrack enough people.
Now monetary incentives are the most popular. They are needed in the real world for any luxury good you want. (And for a lot that you create yourself)
It is trivial to add a monetary aspect to any system using a blockchain, and will always help the self-sustainability of the system.

But quantum computing is not reversible. It's reversible until you do one single measurement. A measurement destroys (part of) the information in a superposition. And measurements are a necessary part of quantum computing, maybe some other paradigm would work, adiabatic computing (
The information in an N-qubit superposition is 2^N a single measurement of 1 qubit will thus destroy 2^(N-1) information. By Landauer's principle you have (N-1)*kT energy dissipation. This is about equal to the classical energy used (except for a constant factor, maybe you can disregard any intermediate bit-flips, which you can compile away in classical computing by using a circuit of 2 levels)
Sources follow in a bit.
EDIT: 
You cannot delete an unknown state as a reversible quantum computation:

I'm sorry I hacked your computer and stole your bitcoins. They're all gone now. Forgive me?

They don't need that, the Fed just needs to issue a private key, signed by the Fed. Let's call it proof-of-key.

Wrong definition of native.
It usually means native to the computer, a compiled library.

luke-jr is a prominent programmer and contributor in the Bitcoin community. 
However he's also someone with extreme views and opinions, which sometimes aren't in line with others (or the majority). This wouldn't be a problem but he acts rashly and swiftly, blocking out the other opinions and changes.
Every time he's on the front-page it's because he made a move (probably with some foretought) that's extreme. He then stubbornly defends it and overrides the opinion of others. Until the hype dies down, and the changes are either forked or the issue isn't big enough to keep arguing about.

There are in my opinion three basic approaches against spam: whitelisting, blacklisting, and smarter algorithms. 
Guess which one you implemented. 
And blacklisting is fine for a lot of people, as long as you are honest about it. However it goes against the core principles of Bitcoin, thats easy to see: dice could change PKey every transaction and it will be useless.

WIF adds a network byte identifying the type: public key, private key, altcoins...
A private key can be used on every ECDSA based altcoin(as far as I know every altcoin). A WIF only on the chosen altcoin. You can reencode the WIF to other altcoins.
EDIT: It's a useless distinction, but it's there.

I don't know exactly but at least:
He maintains one of the historically biggest pools of Bitcoin. He used the hash-power to attack altcoins because they'd be pre-mine scams or others.   
He maintains the bitcoind and Bitcoin-qt branch for Gentoo, which contain patches that are generally not accepted in the Bitcoin community. These wallets filter the transactions of some people, hampering the partiality of the main client. 
He is religious, christian(i think catholic), which created strife when the pool was created: 
This time he's a moderator on the bitcoin wiki, giving him the opportunity to push changes ahead, before others.

Yes. 1 CPU is ~2h40m. Which is still feasible.
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:49:24
I'd do it, but I don't know how the encoding works.
You add spaces, links, newlines. Where can I get the raw version?

Bitcoin is a game of musical chairs. You win by either being totally utterly devoted to winning or by having enough fun to derive other value. If the game grows big enough it will go on forever until the last human being has dropped.

Try adding puzzles that can't be automated. Crossword puzzles are harder than finding words. Try multiple puzzles, or change the type every so often, so that it can't be anticipated.
Make the puzzles harder for machines instead of humans...

Wow, that's a big hint. It cut down the time from 3 hours to 30 minutes to brute force (estimated). I hope I find it...
One of the tested keys:
Cloakcoin, cryptcoin, vericoin...look into them. Sorry to Honorcoin investors ...smelled like a scam. Do your research.My head was swollen - like a bobblehead doll. I was dizzy. Confused.I sat stunned and kept scrolling..

Web scraper for chromium. Got me a csv.
Libreoffice calc to extract a column
Java to filter the text. (removing &lt;br&gt; and &lt;a &gt;)
Apache Common Lang to unescape the HTML
C++ to bruteforce, OpenSSL for crypto.
Bash for distributed system, ~ 100 cores
Each application was prebuilt, I wrote about 50 lines myself, another 5000 on other days.

You should try a different format each time. The puzzles are easy to solve with a computer and a dictionary. Others are easy to brute-force. 
When you did the crossword puzzles, all I needed extra was OCR (I did it manually and was too late). I could probably have semi-automated it. Then you started posting late in my time-zone. 
I did however get the brute-force brainwallets. :)
