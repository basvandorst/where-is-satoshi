Yes you can, if you get into IOTA...

That really isn't true. Most of eastern Europe has high-speed, affordable internet. Same goes for the Nordics where quite affordable 1Gbps connections for residential use have also been available for years.
In the UK for example, the situation is a bit worse, but not by much. Virgin Media has 200Mbps and up for affordable prices (compared to the income) at about £40 a month.
High speed, affordable internet is actually quite common across the European continent. It is true that the more you go east, the faster and more stable it gets.
Russia for example is quite good as well.

And everyone will atomic swap their way out of BTC the instant that happens, lewl.

Why would Bitcoin implement segshit? No need, it already has 10min conf. times, 0 confirmation confidence and $0.01 fees.
Segshit should absolutely remain a Bitcoin Core-only 'advantage'.
[Here's a bunch of other things that Bitcoin can do and Bitcoin Core cannot longer do, you have segshit and LN-coming soon TM to thank for it](

I download 1 TB of data almost on a daily basis. You do realize a single 3D BluRay movies is now upwards of 50GB?
Also, 32MB blocks will not be required for another 5 or 10 years.
Currently, it takes 20 years of 144 4MB blocks every day to fill up a 20TB drive.
Do the math: 4MB times 144 (how many 10 minute intervals there are in a day) and the result of that times 365 (days in a year).
Do the math, see how long it takes to fill a drive available now for the fee of two or three BTC TXs fees.
We don't need any sort of extra layer. We can currently store 20TB residentially with ease: 
By the time 32MB blocks will be needed, it will be 2025 and our storage capacity and internet speed would have scaled as well. Bitcoin is not a singular, isolated technology. Everything evolves around it, and it evolves with everything too. This is what you actually understand if you actually read the whitepaper already - Satoshi was aware of this and was banking on it.
Also, 1GBps internet connection for $10 a month: 
That's eastern Europe. What shithole country are you from that you can't download 1TB of data in a year?

Hahahhaah we got him boys! Another one fooled!

So much this. Main reason I got out and started looking at coins being adopted at something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:45:06
'they don't care about blockchain'
BTC &gt; full mempool for the past month, 3 days for a TX confirmation with a $28 ATH fee.
BCH - just sent a 0.01$ fee (1sat/byte) TX to a friend, confirmed within 7 minutes.
sure mate. sure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:22
This was easy 2 years ago. Doesn't work nowadays. Everywhere I look it's all about Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. Even on the prime time TV cable network news.

1. Yes, 2. Ledger doesn't store them. It allows you to access them securely, repeatedly, from any computer or mobile. 3. Nobody can answer this, it's down to you but the whole thing is no different than any other wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:04
Absolutely not. The NSA has a direct line to them. Do you really think they don't have a backdoor built in like Microsoft, Google et. al.? They are under a non-disclosure agreement, have no canary, nothing.
Not a chance. Your private key should never, EVER see the internet. If it does, even once - you should consider it compromised.

The only problem with this is that these lightning channels are already open. The big problem with lightning is you need to create a new channel and lock-up all your funds that you expect to spend on that channel.
It's like an Amazon gift card, the way they work.
So no, this isn't great. It's actually really depressing to see.

I've been in Bitcoin since 2010. I held up until 2016, when I checked my coins and the price since it started appearing more and more in the news and online. Then I went to and made a simple thread, asking what happened - why are the fees so high and just what happened with the tech.
I was called a shill, a troll, a wanker, I was told to get lost and I was told that this is like gold so why would I need that low fees (I was asking what happened with the 0.01 fees).
I wrote my master thesis on Bitcoin in 2013 so I couldn't believe my eyes. Did some more digging and decided to switch to BCH in full after the fork.
Why did I do this? Because through all those years - I believed in the protocol. We wanted to change the world. We wanted to overthrow banks dominance. We wanted economic freedom. I realised all that was not what the community, nor the people running the tech - want anylonger.
BCH was my escape route because it remained the same as the tech that I always supported.
I wasn't back then, nor am I now - in it for the profit. I never needed the money in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:59
Well then, it's your mom's fault, not whoever sold his coins. I mean why does she care who sold what? Either she believes in the tech and wants to support it, or not.
Bitcoin is not an investment, nor a get rich quick scheme. It's new tech, cutting edge and very risky. This has happened before and will happen again, with or without whoever you think is to blame.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:12
Yes, you described a gift card. You cannot transact "infinitely", you can transact for as much as the funds you've put in the channel.
What's that about the network growing very fast?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:40:07
You are assuming they are by default a thief and a scammer and keeps the private key. They make it clear they do not. Not everyone is a thief and there are legal ways of sending a thief to the justice system.
It isn't secure, I agree - but it's not by default 'fraud'.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:18
I got it from this YouTube video while trying to learn more about the lightning network and that's how it was presented. Is it a lie then?
I think this was the vid: 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:14:32
I know that feel. It took me 9 full days to get my coins off Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:49:12
Okay mate. Nice story.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:03:56
I would tell her what it means and let her make her own mind. I definitely would't say 'that's fraud'.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:01
You didnt link the actual post because thats not what the actual post says. Bad. Very bad.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:35:17
Why? How is this a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:53
Bitstamp. One of the oldest European exchanges. Never had an issue with anyone really. The only regulated one as well. How do you not know about Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:07:43
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:40:49
Yes. Very, very worried. All the other coins are booming (XRB for example grew 8600%) but Bitcoin has been stagnating.
I'll get downvoted for this but you can always go see for yourself at the 24 hour growth and more importantly, 7 and 30 day growth.
My portfolio has had a 500% growth in the past 3 months, it has no BTC in it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:24
Sure mate, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:49
Don't keep your funds on an exchange.

bcash is a registered trademark and cannot be attributed to Bitcoin Cash in any way: 
so no, I'll continue calling it core and cash.

I've been trying to withdraw my shit from Kraken for 1 week and 3 days and counting. I try every day in the morning, afternoon and evening. I even tried at 3am twice. Still no luck.
Either their scam is now complete or someone needs to get fired and by someone I mean the entire I.T team, led by the CEO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:55
He's been on reddit for 10 years. Your account is 5 weeks. He's the shill? Riiight...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:37:00
... white paper?? What does anything from what I said have to do with white paper?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:47:41


BTC - completely useless, 28$ fee, full mempool, tx's take days to confirm. have been for a month to the point that SegWit2X team can't take it anymore, they are reactivating it to try and fix this mess
Meanwhile, BCH - 0.01$ fee (and that is actually exactly what it is - 1sat/byte), fast - like really fast, minutes for a confirmation, and just works. Gets adopted by biggest payment processor (BitPay) and biggest exchange in the US (Coinbase).


hahahahaha. my sides.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:44:06
You just did so, again pointing out a flaw in my character, not my argument. Redditor for 6 days. So what, does that solve the lightning network issue we were discussing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:05:55
Yes, because your 3 months make you a real hero or something, right? Mate come on.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:25:13
No. I don't mean Bitcoin Cash. It could be any other coin that can actually handle being a currency. I mean why is that an issue - why are you mad? I'm just responding to the guy who said the market is after digital gold. I think the market is after both, and if Bitcoin doesn't do it - another will. Back off man.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:00:06
Ummm, no. It will prove the point that the market is already using a different coin as currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:08
So you used semantics to 'dismantle' the problem? By comparing them with a gift card and saying lock-up - I meant exactly how a gift card also works. 
You can redeem it back for the money at any time, as a refund - if you bought it, but until then - they are 'locked up' in that particular channel. Locked up means you cannot use them for anything else, unless you free them up. It doesn't mean you forever lose access to your funds. The latter conclusion is both illogical and irrational to even suggest it's what I meant and that I was unclear.
Also, this has nothing to do with reddit or This is about the lighting network and its associated issues. Don't you dare ad hominem me because you've got nothing better to put forward.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:43
Riiiiiiighhhht. That 3d degree if separation thing. Like a web. Got it. Thats cool.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:14:25
Download any other wallet and restore your Ledger wallet from your 24 word seed. The seed derives the same set of individual wallet private keys every time so any BIP44 or BIP39 wallet should do, such as Coinomi or Jaxx for example.
So you don't actually need Ledger to access your coins. Ledger just makes accessing them repeatedly safe.
Also, get 2x Ledgers now and store one safely in case your main one gets lost or damaged.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:34
Again. Out of context. Just post the blog and let people read the whole thing maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:28
So... stop using the brains of hundreds of hundreds of people, all trying to look for consensus in something and looking at things in every possible way, and listen to this one guy instead? No.
