I think it’s a blunt dude. Last I checked a backwood is a shitty cigar...

10k over what period of time?

Wait what?

So aside from the appearance and such, what don't people like about Frizbee? The way I see it Voat is structured such that if they became the next reddit similar problems could arise in relation to censorship. Frizbee's approach actually solves this issue by putting content ownership back in the hands of content creators.

Sure you do. I choose not to use this software, because I don't trust random strangers on my network. :)

I do agree that it is a pretty good deal; however, the wording is not specific enough. In fact, I found out about this deal from a friend, who told me 'Tradewave is giving out $500 for people using their bots on Coinsetter'.
Here is how you could have worded the title differently 'Tradewave: Get $500 of free credit to trade BTC/USD on Coinsetter *for one month*'.
If you want help rewording your other PR assets feel free to PM me.

Well look at the last comments on that account... One of them is this:

    Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet. Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing Bitcoin.

Gotta love marketing... 'Get $500 of free credit to trade' is borderline deceiving. I feel bad for everyone who thinks they are getting a free $500.

Indeed. It is pretty terrible. Overall I think this is one of those ideas that sounds good at first, but when you start to think about it you realize it has it has severe caveats. I could absolutely see innocent people using this on their wifi, only to be end up being targeted as criminals due to users' illicit activities.
