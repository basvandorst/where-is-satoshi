How are they going to confiscate my Bitcoin?
I say, "they're not going to".
How are they going "print" Bitcoin from thin air to pay for the socialism?
I say, "they cannot".
Therefore, I say, "Bitcoin is not at all compatible with socialism, whereas fiat currency is completely compatible with socialism."

To be fair, he used the word "legitimate" :
**Mnuchin:** Well again if you’re dealing with a legitimate  entity in the U.S., those legitimate entities that are attached to  crypto are indeed subject to the Know Your Customer Rules and AML. If  you’re looking to use bitcoins to go through those entities and go on  the dark web and think you’re not going to get caught, you’re gonna get  caught. So this is a warning if you want to use it for speculation,  that’s one thing. If you want to use it for illicit activities, we’re  going to put the full effort of the U.S. Treasury and the regulators  onto that. 
*fair enough*
**Also**: As money service businesses, cryptocurrency money transmitters are  subject to compliance examinations just like every other U.S. bank. ... To be clear, the US welcomes responsible innovation, including new  technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and  expand access to financial services.
**Mnunchin: ...** this is this is intended to be a level playing field, whether you’re  money-gram. or you’re a bank or you’re an online or you’re PayPal. This  is intended to be a level playing field. And again what we do encourage,  and there’s been a lot of financial innovation away from traditional  banks for electronic payment systems, lots of people use electronic  payment systems in dollars very effectively and you know we’ll continue  to support those activities. We want technology to evolve.

In no particular order:
* When you're out of debt
* When you have an emergency cash cushion
* When you have money to invest which you won't need for two or more years
At that time, you're ready to establish an account at an exchange, buy a relatively small amount of Bitcoin, and get a wallet.  Also, at this point you should start learning what Bitcoin actually is and the basics of how it work.  You should start to learn basic Bitcoin security.
When you know what Bitcoin actually is and how to keep it secure... when you know how to get your Bitcoin from the exchange safely into your own wallet, THEN it is good to get it with more than a small amount.

Fiat money is a "general purpose I.O.U."
What makes fiat money break is the fact that a small group of people have the sole ability to create these I.O.U.s by the trillions with no effort and no expense to them.  When they do that, when they create I.O.U.s and then exchange them for actual wealth, they literally steal from the rest of us.

What's going to happen: fiat currencies will suddenly die (the USD, YEN, Pound, Euro, Yuan, Rupee, etc.)
Some people will turn to gold/silver.  
Some people will turn to Bitcoin.  
Some will turn to both.  
A few will push around wheelbarrows full of fiat currency bills, because they just don't get it.
We will reach the point of "permanent backwardation" where nobody in their right mind will exchange BTC for ANY amount of USD (or any other fiat currencies).

Are zero percent interest rates normal and natural?   No.  But that's what we have had for the last decade.
Negative interest rates?  You can't honestly say there is anything "natural" or healthy about negative interest rates unless you're completely insane.  Yet, there is $12 Trillion of negative interest rate debt in the world now - and it's growing.  It's a ticking bomb.  Nothing normal or usual about it.
Shit hit the fan in 2008.  Nothing significant got fixed as a result.  The global economy has been on "life support in the ICU" for the last decade.  Picture an old, sick man who has been in a hospital bed for ten years, with tubes and wires connecting him to machines to barely keep him alive.  
The next downturn hits that old, sick man.  He can't jump out of that bed to fight.  He will die.
Fiat money, the only kind of money many people have ever known, is about to die.
This is no ordinary "business cycle".  This is the end game for fiat currencies and the corrupt system built upon them.

Look: It's really simple: **buy and hold long term.**  That's it.
Why don't you "backtest" that?  You'll see that over the last 6 years, Bitcoin has gone up an average of 121 percent per year.  That is, it more than doubles each year, on average.
If that's not "enough" for you, then you have serious mental issues which even-higher returns won't cure, even **IF** you could obtain them over the long run.
Reality is, frequent trading leads to wreckage and only makes the guys who own the trading platforms rich (from **fees**).

The price of Bitcoin is based upon supply and demand.  
Supply from people choosing to sell.  
Demand from people choosing to buy.  
What causes people to make up their mind to buy or sell?  Events in the real world: natural disasters, economic events (bank bail outs, bail-ins), wars, government actions or lack thereof... 
Plotting the recent price changes does not predict future "events.  Therefore TA is fake, rubbish, horseshit.
If TA was scientific, everybody using it would come to the same conclusion, but they don't because it is not scientific.
You can't predict the future and drawing lines on price history charts does not predict the future.

The legitimate reason for futures markets: so that businesses can better plan their expenses.
Let's say you run a business.  Your employees want to be paid in BTC; they want their pay to be a fixed amount of BTC per week, for the next six months.  Most of your business is done in USD.  You don't know what the price of 1 BTC will be tomorrow, and certainly you have no idea what it will be 3 months from now, 5 months from now...
In that case, you can go to a futures market, and generate a contract to purchase a certain amount of BTC at a certain price on a certain date -- let the speculator handle the risk.  The idea is that the speculator somehow knows more about what the price of BTC is likely to be than you do.
Let's say the speculators at the futures market figure that 3 months from now they'll be able to deliver BTC to you for $12000 each.  If the price of BTC stays where it is today, or goes down, the speculator makes profit.  If, on the other hand, the price of 1 BTC goes up to $15K, the speculator loses money, unless he buys a bunch of BTC today.
In reality, futures markets are just big casinos.
Like many other thing (stocks, real estate, etc.), the best way to invest in Bitcoin is to just buy some and hold onto it for a long, long time.  No "trading" in and out is necessary, nor advised.  Maybe buy more along the way, and hold onto that, too.

First, let me say, it's beautiful, well crafted, etc.  Good job.
Second... Let's think about what a bank note is (or was).  There was a time when people used gold as money.  Gold is expensive to store/transport securely.  The goldsmiths had to have 24/7 security anyhow, so they would offer to store gold for customers.  A person would deposit an amount of gold, and the goldsmith would give them a written receipt to allow them to get their gold back out, later, IF the goldsmith was still in business and IF he had enough gold in his vault.  Think: bank runs.  You see, people started using the "notes" as "money", but the goldsmiths figured out they could issue "counterfeit" notes (look up inflation, rehypothecation, theft, bank run).
Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store and transport securely.  We don't need "notes," either.  You can (and should) posses and control your own private key(s).  And you should store those keys securely, not have them "on display" where they can be stolen from you, or burned up in a fire, or ruined in a flood or tornado...

It's brainwashing.  Groupthink.  Laziness on their part.
There's even this "social stigma" associated with renting - especially among older people.  But it's bullshit.
You don't get ahead of the crowd by following the crowd.  Right now, the crowd is all clamoring to go deeply into debt to buy what all the other crowd members are buying - a home.
Nothing wrong, per se, with owning real estate.  But when that's your only hope... and you only own one home (the one you live in), and you owe money on it... Those people are just doing what they've been told.
Here's a fun one: They'll mention the "tax break" that home owners (supposedly) get.  Let's never mind that renters get a "standard deduction".  Basically, the home owner pays, let's say, $24K per year to their lender, for interest.  The government "gives" them a break of maybe $6K.  **They spent $24K to get $6K back.**  I sincerely offer them to DOUBLE the government's offer: *give me $24K and I'll give you $12K back, AND, I'll do it immediately - you won't have to wait a year or file any paperwork/forms...*  This pisses them off.

Not an effective medium of exchange... not yet.  It isn't "finalized".  In the meanwhile it is a medium of exchange and excels at certain things, but it isn't hugely scalable YET.
As soon as he brings up "intrinsic value" at 1:04 into the video, I know that **he doesn't understand money,** because all money, by design has little or no "intrinsic value" -- that's the whole IDEA behind money.  
When people exchange items with significant intrinsic value, they're not using money, they're **bartering**.
Money, being a "general purpose I.O.U." needs no "intrinsic value.  It should have the following properties:
* Durable
* Divisible
* Portable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* **Scarce/rare**
* Difficult to produce and/or counterfeit
Both Bitcoin and gold have all of those properties; fiat currency does not.
By the way, gold's "intrinsic value" is on par with aluminum and copper.  It's scarcity gives it value far beyond its intrinsic value.

First, congratulations.
Second: Look, man, women want to wear that ring, and to show it to their friends... you'll want other guys to see it on her finger, too.
Do make sure you buy a high-quality stone with no flaws visible to the unaided human eye, because she is going to look at her ring about 12 million times per day, and if there's even the tiniest flaw, her eye will always focus on it -- that would be bad.  So, buy a visually perfect stone, or buy one where the flaws have been removed (they drill a VERY narrow hole and etch it out, then fill the hole with some kind of silicone w/ the same refractive index as diamond), or buy her a nice cubic zirconia.
Oh, and don't buy any stone at 1.00 carats, nor 1.01, nor 2.0, nor 2.01, etc.
If you don't understand diamonds - learn, or go to Tiffany and be prepared to fork over some major dough... but you'll get that cool Tiffany box.

People stored Bitcoin before the first hardware wallet was invented.  It's cold, off-line storage.  Sometimes it's called a "paper wallet".
In a nutshell:  
 * use a computer which will never be connected to the Internet again  
 * put a javascript program on it  
 * aim the computer's web browser at that javascript  
 * roll a die about 100 times, enter the numbers rolled  
 * click a button  
 * generate a private key / public address pair  
 * write those down, make a copy, double-then-tripple check  
 * send BTC to the public address  
Later, if you want to spend some of that BTC, you have to sweep/import the private key into a wallet on a machine connected to the Internet.
It's a pain in the ass, unless you love doing weird shit with numbers.  You have to be very careful not to screw up and lose your Bitcoin.

To me, Bitcoin isn't about people buying a cup of coffee with their smartphone.  
To me, Bitcoin isn't some magic thing you put fiat into so you can extract even more fiat from it, later.  
Look at certain central banks and certain countries around the world: they provide us with fiat currencies, while they work furiously to hoard gold - hundreds of tons of gold.
Let that sink in.
Hundreds  
of tons  
of gold.  
Obviously, they know better than to trust each other.  They know better than to trust in fiat.  
For a while, they kind of "had to" trust in the USD, but those days are coming to an end.  
There are serious issues with gold; still, it's a lot better than any fiat currency.  
Along comes Bitcoin...
Bitcoin can do what gold does, and Bitcoin can do it better.  
To me, Bitcoin is about a de facto Global Reserve Currency.  
Forget your little coffee shop -- think about fleets of oil tankers moving about the globe.  Think about natural gas pipelines.  Think about global trade.  Fuel. Minerals. Food. Lumber.... commodities...

If you only see Bitcoin as this "vending machine" where you put a dollar in at the top and instantly a stream of $100 bills pours out the bottom, you're going to be disappointed.
Let me encourage you to learn a few things:
* Learn about money.  Chances are you don't ***really*** understand money - most people do not.  There is no shame in admitting you don't understand something so common.  There is much shame if you can't admit that you don't really understand what it is, how it works, etc.
* Learn about the current global financial system, based upon fiat money.  There are some very serious problems, and the Big Shit is about to Hit The Fan.  Your TV won't tell you about it until it's too late for you to protect yourself and your loved ones.
* Learn about Bitcoin, what it actually IS, and the basics of how it works.
If you're willing to open your mind and spend some time to learn, then you'll appreciate Bitcoin for what it IS, as opposed to seeing it as some "get rich scheme".  Understanding Bitcoin, then owning it for the right reasons can drastically change your life.
Here's an excellent, short video to start with:

You cannot "time the market".  Just jump in.
Buy a small amount, learn without fear of fucking up and losing your life savings.  Learn how to open an account at an exchange, transfer some funds to it, buy a small amount of BTC, get a wallet, send your BTC to your wallet, send some BTC to a friend (it's actually kind of fun), etc.
Start learning about proper cyber security, how to keep your Bitcoin / Wallet secure.  Watch some videos and/or read some books: learn what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works.   Also, learn about different forms of money, and why some are better than others.
Don't invest money you might need for something else within the next two or three years --- be prepared to be patient.

Technically, nothing "backs" gold.
When people used gold as money, they would often deposit some of it with a goldsmith, or at a bank.  The goldsmith or banker would issue them a "bank note" which was "backed by" physical gold, that is, anybody could take that note back to that bank/goldsmith and redeem it for that amount of physical gold.
The notes were "backed by" gold (or, they were supposed to be...)
Gold is just gold.  It's not backed by anything.  Or you could turn it around and say, "It's backed by all manner of goods and/or services, since you can exchange it for that kind of stuff."
Gold is a good form of money because it has the seven necessary properties:
* Durable
* Divisible
* Portable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* Scarce
* Difficult to create and/or counterfeit
Fiat money lacks all 7 properties and has built-in defects which cause it to eventually collapse.
Bitcoin also has all 7 properties, but it is even better than gold in certain ways.

Welcome to Bitcoin!

To get started, see the "resources" links on the side-bar &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Like u/wsheep says, buy a small amount to learn with.  That way, if you make a mistake, you only lose a small amount but gain important lessons.
Sign up at an exchange, get a wallet for your computer, buy some BTC (Bitcoin), transfer your BTC from the exchange to your wallet, then wait, and wait.  Never panic, just keep waiting.  In five or ten years... who knows?  
Once you have a small amount, take the time to learn what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works, and why it is clearly superior to fiat currencies.  Here are some links to get you started:

The **idea** is that they can predict the future by merely plotting the price-vs-time in the recent past, then drawing lines on that chart.  This idea is wrong; it has roots in bullshit lies of desperate salesmen.  You cannot predict the future that way, but you can, and in the long run **will lose all or most of your investment** that way.
Tomorrow's price of Bitcoin is not determined solely upon last weeks price changes.  It does not work that way.  Tomorrow's price (whether it goes up, or down, or stays the same) will be based upon tomorrow's supply and demand; supply and demand are driven by a large number of investors and/or potential investors who interpret **global events** \-- government decisions, politicians saying things, doing things, corporate announcements, media information/disinformation, natural events/disasters, new discoveries in math/science... things that are not determined, nor can be predicted by merely looking at Bitcoin's price changes over the last few days, or few months.

Today's trading nonsense has its roots in old-time "churn". Let's go back in time:
* Before there was Bitcoin
* Before there was eTrade
* Before there was a public Internet
* Before people had computers in their homes
There  were stock brokers, with telephones. They earned commissions. If they  wanted to make some money, they had to convince clients to make trades.
Remember: no trades = no commissions = broker goes hungry.
The  brokers got creative as far as their techniques for talking people into  needlessly moving their money around. They came up with  technical-sounding jargon, they drew stupid little charts upon which  they superimposed lines... they gave it a scientific-sounding name:  "technical analysis" as if they were designing rocket parts for NASA's  Apollo space program. But, under the hood, it was pure bullshit, and  still is. The idea was (and still is) to convince people that they could  time the market, that is, predict the future, when in reality, it's  just bullshit.
Remember: no trades = no commissions = broker goes hungry.
Notice:  if those brokers could actually beat the market, somehow, they would  have just traded their way to the top -- but they didn't, because they  couldn't, because their TA is rubbish; so they got on the phone and  tried to convince others to move some of their funds around so that the  broker could gain a measly commission, and maybe pay his rent, or buy  lunch.
Meanwhile, wise investors  knew to be patient, to not pay a lot of broker fees/commissions, to not  take risks based upon hocus-pocus "technical analysis" bullshit. Buy  something solid, hold onto it for a long time, be patient, slowly grow  rich. That's not glamorous, and that does not put money in the brokers'  pockets, but it works.

The "economics" forum has the most cowardly cowards, the Keynesians.
You won't find many/any Austrian economists there, nor many with much "common sense".
Anybody who dares to challenge the false teachings they call "economics" will have their posts removed and eventually gets banned -- for posting facts, for posting the truth.  Maybe it's because they can't admit they wasted a LOT of money to have their heads filled with dirty, smelly, used cat litter.
Those guys are fucked up, it's actually kind of sad.  They've been brainwashed: they don't know what "money" actually is -- they were never taught.  They don't even believe that hyperinflation is caused by excessive money "printing".  They're lost.
They've been told their "economics" is "scientific," but those I questioned didn't know what "science" actually **is**.  They think that "science" means using big words and technical jargon.  I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

For the ultra-paranoid, it's the ultimate... almost.
So, let's say you generated one or more private keys.  You've parked BTC in it/them.  Where to store those private keys?
You don't want to lose them.  You don't want anybody else to find them or steal them.  
So, don't send them to a printer.  Write them down.  There is risk of making a transcription mistake.  Write down a second (or third) copy.  Compare the copies to each other.  Compare the copies to what's on the computer monitor.  Double/triple check everything.  Then check it again.
At this point, you're still vulnerable to things like:
 * fire
 * flood (includes leaking pipes and or fire sprinkler system going off as well as some river overflowing its banks...)
 * mud slide, avalanche
 * aircraft crashing on top of your home
 * burglars, home invasion robbers
 * government agents, with or without a proper warrant
So, you'll need at least one "off site" copy, geographically separated.  But what if somebody finds it?  You'd be fucked.  This is where you get to be creative.  Maybe (carefully) split the key(s) somehow and store the split parts in separate locations... while hiding the 'at home' copy so cleverly that nobody in their right mind would ever discover it.  (Like, don't write it down and put it in your top desk drawer.)

For 24 words, it's roughly like this:
Think about sand, all the individual grains of sand on earth: sand from oceans/beaches, deserts, rivers, lakes...  Suppose we've placed All That Sand in one Huge Box.  You pick one grain, at random.  Just one grain.  Hold it carefully as we shrink you down, down, down until you see that the grain of sand is another planet, just like Earth.  Go down onto the planet you picked, and pick one random grain of sand from it -- that's YOUR seed.
What are the odds that two people will pick the exact planet, then the exact same grain of sand on that planet?  Not zero, but very, very close to zero odds.

No.  Learn what a Ponzi is.  Then learn what Bitcoin actually is.  It's clear you're missing essential knowledge on this subject.
Bitcoin is not a  Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:
*  there is an  "operator" -- a central authority (one    person, or a small group), a  swindler. 
*  The swindler receives money from people
*  The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some    business venture with an  expected high rate of return.  That money is    NOT invested.  There is  no money-making business venture.  Any returns    are paid from the  swindled money.  
* The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a  big,   fat lie.  
* The  Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new  suckers   arrive to put  their money into it.  
* A Ponzi scheme cannot  survive a   "crash".  
* A  Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.
Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin     is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an     immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.

Bitcoin allows smart people to store wealth where neither irresponsible governments nor criminal bankers can "take it" or "inflate it".
Fight off recessions?  Things to consider: is that the government's proper role?  If so, should it not strive to prevent recessions in the first place?  Perhaps recessions are unavoidable, a necessary and healthy thing in the long run?  
Great depression?  Why not take a while to ponder the ultimate **causes** of the Great Depression?
"Increasing the money supply" is theft.  Yes.  It is.  Do you really think it's the government's role to steal from one group to bail out people who did foolish things with their money?  I don't.
The problems tend to be caused by "money from thin air," yet we're **told** that creating more money from thin air is the solution.  Is it?  I say, "no."
If we switch from fiat to Bitcoin, the banks won't be lending money created from thin air, on the spot.  They'll have to loan **actual Bitcoin**, which they either own, or have on deposit at a 1-to-1 ratio.  If they act stupidly, and, for example, lend people like my stupid, unemployed sister $440K to buy a tiny apartment, they'll lose **their own** money when they find out the hard way that she's never going to pay them back for real estate she overpaid for... and rightly so.  They should not get bailed out so they can do it again at the expense of the rest of us.

We are not taught (in school) how to think clearly.  We are not taught about "money".
To the typical person, we Bitcoin fanatics are kooks - there is something wrong with us.
Also, most people have no wealth to store/protect.  Why do they need Bitcoin?  They can't see that the reason they're broke and/or in debt is because of a flawed money system.
We are fucking lazy, especially when it comes to thinking/learning.  It is easy to just do what you've been told to do.  "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down."
But then, one day, the fiat financial system fails...  "What do you mean I can't buy gasoline, or groceries?  Why are all the banks and ATMs closed?  When are 'they' going to fix it?"

Long term holding has an extremely high ROI... in the last several years, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled each year, on average.  With returns like that, there's not reason to take on risk and fees and potential tax consequences.

Actually, there are those who are allowed to "print" fiat currencies (and their cronies), and then the rest of us.  They are billionaires and people with hundreds of millions.
Then there is the rest of us.  Some with a few thousand bucks saved up, and so on.
That first group is not rich because they're smarter or work harder.  They're that rich because they either control the "printing press" or are closely connected to somebody who does.

Gold is expensive to store securely.
Gold is very, very expensive to transport securely in significant amounts.
Gold sets off metal detectors, takes up space, has considerable weight.
Imagine trying to get $2 million worth of gold through an airport, undetected.
Imagine you're a refuge, fleeing a violent tyranny.  You're going to carry 20 or 30 pounds of gold with you as you encounter other refugees, bandits, pirates, corrupt border guards/soldiers?
Bitcoin?  No problem.  Easy, inexpensive to secure.  Easy, inexpensive to transport.  Invisible.  Weightless.  Undetectable.

Also: I found this interesting: We don't get our rights from the Constitution.  We don't get our rights from the so-called "Bill of Rights".  We don't get our rights from the Declaration of Independence, yet, therein we find where we DO get our rights: We are BORN with them.
A person or government might violate our rights, but they cannot take them from us - similar to a speeder violating the speed limit: the limit still exists, he's just breaking the law.  Our rights always exist, even when some dickhead loser has to resort to violating them.
We **consent** to **give** certain, enumerated (listed out in writing) powers to our government because *some* government is better than no government at all, and limited government is better than totalitarianism.
Finally, none of this matters if everybody decides to be a coward when people's rights are being violated.  (Remember, if they violate my rights and get away with it, they'll eventually violate yours, too.)

Today's trading nonsense has its roots in old-time "churn". Let's go back in time:
*    Before there was Bitcoin
*    Before there was eTrade
*    Before there was a public Internet
*    Before people had computers in their homes
There were stock brokers, with telephones. They earned commissions. If they wanted to make some money, they had to convince clients to make trades.
Remember: no trades = no commissions = broker goes hungry.
The brokers got creative as far as their techniques for talking people into needlessly moving their money around. They came up with technical-sounding jargon, they drew stupid little charts upon which they superimposed lines... they gave it a scientific-sounding name: "technical analysis" as if they were designing rocket parts for NASA's Apollo space program. But, under the hood, it was pure bullshit, and still is. The idea was (and still is) to convince people that they could time the market, that is, predict the future, when in reality, it's just bullshit.
Remember: no trades = no commissions = broker goes hungry.
Notice: if those brokers could actually beat the market, somehow, they would have just traded their way to the top -- but they didn't, because they couldn't, because their TA is rubbish; so they got on the phone and tried to convince others to move some of their funds around so that the broker could gain a measly commission, and maybe pay his rent, or buy lunch.
Meanwhile, wise investors knew to be patient, to not pay a lot of broker fees/commissions, to not take risks based upon hocus-pocus "technical analysis" bullshit. Buy something solid, hold onto it for a long time, be patient, slowly grow rich. That's not glamorous, and that does not put money in the brokers' pockets, but it works.

Be sure to have a "main point".  Repeat it often and end with it.
Save time for questions and answers.
Have a handout sheet with links or one link to a page full of links.  Put the main point(s) on that sheet, too.
As for main point(s): Ask yourself, "If they don't get ANYTHING ELSE from my presentation, I want them to get THIS."  What is that "THIS" for you?  (Maybe you have a small number of "THESE" instead of one "THIS".)  Anyhow, make sure you hit that main point early and repeat it often, and end the presentation by repeating it.
Other than that, I'd avoid too many details about mining.  I'd try to compare it to things they're already familiar with: "It's a ledger, like your bank statement... a list of transactions where person A sends an amount to person B, but the ledger is all over the Internet instead of inside a bank's data center."  Something like that.
The main thing, though, is to repeat your "main point(s)' often so at least that part sticks.

Nobody can accurately predict the future, long term.  TA is total bullshit.  Buy and hold, long term; patient investors have been richly rewarded so far (and should continue to be).
Nobody outperforms the market, long term.  This is true for stocks, gold, and Bitcoin.
It goes back to the days of stock brokers on the telephone with clients, before there was Bitcoin, before there was eTrade, before there was an Internet...  Stock brokers made money from commissions - so they needed to generate "churn", trades in order to generate income.  They had to use "mumbo jumbo" to give the **illusion** that they could beat the market, making their commission/fee worth the price.  This is where all the bullshit "TA" comes from.  It comes from desperate salesmen trying to generate churn by tricking people into believing that the "broker" has some special knowledge not available to the public.
Here we are, decades later -- and there's no end to delusional fools who think they have some special knowledge not available to the public, that their TA works, that their shit doesn't stink like shit...
Just buy and hold, long term.  People who have been doing that have been richly rewarded.
Remember: pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.  If more than doubling your money every year (on average, long term) hasn't been "good enough" ROI for you, then you're fucked up and maybe deserve to get rekt.

Trading is for gullible fools.
The smart people just buy, then hold long term.
Trading exposes you to unnecessary risks, which pile up over time to work against you.
Trading entails fees, which accumulate and work against you over time.
Depending on your tax laws, as many in the US are finding out the hard way, frequent trading can complicate your tax situation, exposing you to further costs (taxes, fees).
Is all this extra risk and expense worth it?
Long term, on average, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled every year.
Let that soak in.
...more than double your money each year, long term, on average...
Is that not enough for you?  Then you're fucked up.  Don't be fucked up; don't expose yourself to needless risk;  don't pay a lot of transaction fees (or taxes).

If the Central Banks (Fed) raise rates, all hell breaks loose.
If they don't raise rates, they might kick the can a little further down the road, THEN all hell breaks loose.
Look at Japan.  Their central bank was the first fool to jump into the pit of tar, and they're still stuck there -- there is no escape.

    We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
      that all men are created equal,
      that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
      that among these are Life,
                           Liberty and
                           the pursuit of Happiness.
    
      — That to secure these rights,
        Governments are instituted among Men,
        deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
    
      — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
        it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
        and to institute new Government,
        laying its foundation on such principles
            and organizing its powers in such form,
            as to them shall seem most likely
            to effect their Safety and Happiness. 
    
    
    Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. 
    
    But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism,
    
      it is their right,
      it is their duty,
      to throw off such Government,
    
    and to provide new Guards for their future security.
*We don't get our rights from the government.  We don't get our rights from the Constitution, nor the Bill of Rights.*  ***We are created and born with certain unalienable rights****.  You were born with them - they can never be taken from you.*
*We* ***consent*** *to give our government certain, limited, enumerated powers because a* ***limited government is better than anarchy.  A limited government is better than tyranny.***

Yes.  They all go broke, eventually.
Each trade entails risk.  Frequent trades means you accumulate risk - unnecessarily.
Each trade entail cost/fees.  The trading plat form makes money from each trade, whether the trader gets reckt or not.  These fees are significant, and they add up over time.  When combined with risk... you're guaranteed to lose over the long run.
Each trade might entail tax complications.  You might have to pay somebody hundreds of dollars or more to help you sort things out.
Day trading is therefore a way to separate fools from their money.  What's sad is that the fools come here and pretend they've got some unique way to beat the system, to get ahead.  Guess what?

Bitcoin exists within a **ledger**.  Copies of that ledger exists on over ten thousand computers all over the globe.
What you need to be concerned about are your private keys.  *Oh!  But you don't actually* ***have*** *your private keys, coinbase does.*  Technically, you don't have ***any*** Bitcoin.
Do an internet search on "not your keys, not your Bitcoin".
Meanwhile, you need to make sure you have a copy of your login and password for coinbase.
Meanwhile, get a good wallet, then transfer your precious Bitcoins from the exchange to your wallet.  Also, make sure you have a Secure off-site backup of your wallet and/or private keys (or the 24-word phrase).

Let's examine some of the past performance of the very simple, "buy and hold long term" strategy:
1 year: +58%
2 years: +312%
3 years: +1398%
4 years: +3784%
5 years: +1456%
6 years: +11,782%
Looks to me as if "buy and hold long term" is one awesome investment strategy.  For the last 6 years, Bitcoin has gone up an average of 121% per year.
If that's not good enough for you, then nothing is -- you have some very serious "issues" which making even more than 121% per year are not going to fix.
The way to make money with frequent trading is to be the guy collecting the **fees** from idiots who aren't wise enough to just buy and hold long term.  Frequent traders frequently get reckt and lose all/most of their investment... for what?  Why?  Because +121% per year isn't enough?  Get real.

Your primary asset is your brain.  Nothing can substitute for clear, flexible thinking - especially during an upheaval.  
For example, what worked for your grandparents and/or parents might get you killed, financially if you stick to it rigidly.  
Your brain is a physical, living thing, part of your body, and it needs to be taken care of, physically.  Eat healthy foods, get regular exercise, take vitamins (just in case), and get enough sleep.  
Let me repeat: get enough sleep.
Your mind also needs attention.  Take time to learn to spot logical fallacies (and to not fall into those traps).  Take time to ponder the "big picture".  Do puzzles and/or math to strengthen you mind.  Meditate, it's really simple, but it takes practice.  Learn - never stop learning.  Here's a hard one: learn to UNLEARN as much bullshit/brainwashing as possible.  
We have all been exposed to brainwashing and propaganda and will continue to be.  Believe it or not, your mind (like mine) has been contaminated with all manner of bullshit, lies, fallacies, myths.  I don't think you can rid yourself of all of it, but you can (and should) make an effort to learn to recognize it, and learn to focus your mind more on truthful matters.
For example, many of us would love to zoom around town in a sleek Lambo.  Vrrooom, vrooom!  Why?  Think about it.  If you were the last person on earth, or one of the last 1 million people alive on the planet, would you still prefer an exotic, inefficient, unreliable "trophy" vehicle?  Probably not, mostly because there would be no body to "show off" in front of.
So - get busy, INVEST IN YOURSELF: your health, your fitness, your mental fitness... get enough sleep.  Learn to focus on the big picture.  Invest in friendships/relationships.  Part of what you know is who you know.  Strive to create win-win situations.

“God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ... And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them.

# Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons  
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping*  66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  "Almost as much as the  Czech Rebublic".  They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  One hundred and ten thousand.  Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans.  0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.

First, the government outlaws cash.  So, you have to use digital fiat currency -- similar to using a payment card now.
After that, instead of paying you interest for money you have in the bank, the bank charges you... they take some of your money.  The longer you leave it sitting there, and the more you leave sitting there, the more they'll take.
Remember, if you get caught with cash, you're automatically a criminal.

...but the waves are sick.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:56:15
My advice, in no particular order, includes but is not limited to:
Stay out of debt.  
Save a cash cushion (for emergencies, and/or sudden, temporary opportunities).  
Don't borrow money to invest.  
Never invest money you might "need" in the next year or two (or three).  
Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets.  Diversify.  
Don't panic.  
Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.  This is especially true for real estate.
Be patient.  Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.  In other words, excessive greed leads to foolishness, whereas fools and their money are soon parted.  Beware of scams.
If something sounds too good to be true - it probably is.  Be skeptical.  Be cautious.  Don't listen to realtors.
Don't bother watching/listening to mainstream financial "news" - that's just bullshit, mostly, and typically a big waste of time.
You're going to fuck up once in a while.  It hurts - it's supposed to hurt so that you LEARN from your mistakes.  You paid for it, you might as well learn from it to get your money's worth.
Invest in yourself.  Learn.  Read books.  Listen to people with an open, yet skeptical mind.  Pick a career with decent salary opportunities, and one not soon to be replaced by robots.  Work hard, keep learning new skills to keep yourself marketable.  Live frugally, spend less than you earn so you can save.  Being a saver will put you ahead of most of the other people your age.  Still, go ahead and enjoy some of your wealth from time to time.
Learn to see "the big picture".  This takes many years of dedication.  Learn what money is, what money used to be, and how it works.  Learn what makes some forms of money better than others.  Learn about banks and central banks and fractional reserve lending.  Learn about gold and why people used it for money as well as why they stopped.  Learn about taxes, and demographics, government debt, corporate debt, global debt.  Learn about currencies and currency wars.  Learn about inflation and hyperinflation.  Learn the difference between "actual wealth," and mere "money".
Don't listen to Keynesian "economists" - they are worse than the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz; they do the dirty work of some very evil people.  Learn to appreciate the Austrian school of economics.
Fortune favors the prepared mind.  Be on the lookout for opportunities -- have cash handy to be able to take advantage of them.  Spend at least a few minutes per day, alone, just thinking about your future and how you're going to get there.
Be leery of things that "everybody" is investing in, like real estate.  You'll never get ahead of the crowd by following it.  Most "home owners" have had their heads filled with bullshit and lies - and they can't do simple math, most of them, nor can they reason logically -- but they'll argue all day and night for years about their precious real estate while they go deeper and deeper into debt, making their bankers rich.  What worked for your grandparents or parents probably isn't going to work for you.
Know that the stock markets are rigged, and have been rigged for a long time.  Still, it has been a not-too-bad place to park Some of your wealth, long term.  Just buy a popular index fund, say, S&amp;P 500 and hold long term.  Unless your employer matches it, or unless you plan to be really poor when you retire, 401K plans are a bad idea.  But if your employer matches your contributions AND the vesting time is short, they can be a not-so-bad place to park wealth, long term.
Take care of your health.  Stay fit.  Get plenty of sleep.  Don't fuck up your health trying to get richer.  Be happy first, then grow rich -- don't turn into yet another miserable rich person (I've met many).  Money won't make you happy if you're miserable.  But if you're a happy, jolly person and you become rich, it's a lot of fun.

What is a Ponzi scheme?
In    a Ponzi scheme there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one    person, or a small group), a swindler.  The swindler receives money from    people, promising them that their money will be invested in some    business venture with an expected high rate of return.  That money is    NOT invested.  There is no money-making business venture.  Any returns    are paid from the swindled money.  The entire thing is based upon a  big,   fat lie.  The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new  suckers   arrive to put their money into it.  A Ponzi scheme cannot  survive a   "crash".  A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin makes no promises.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin    is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an    immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.

Imagine you had a printing press... NO.  Better than that!  You have a computer terminal with which you get to create all the money you want.  You just type in whatever account balance you'd like, hit 'enter' and -- poof -- you have that amount of money.
So, you type in, say 5 trillion dollars.  Poof!  All yours.
What are you going to DO with all your money?  If you're smart, you'll exchange it for actual wealth, including but not limited to:  
 * real estate  
 * stocks, entire companies  
 * rights to resources  
 * vaults full of gold bars, silver bars, platinum bars  
 * private jets, yachts, helicopters, furs, country club memberships  
...and if you're really smart you also make sure to buy:  
 * politicians  
 * judges  
 * regulators  
 * mass media outlets  
You'd use your media outlets to tell everybody what great guy you are, how you're "saving the country's economy," when, in fact, you're literally robbing everybody else.
This is not a make believe thing.  There actually is a small group with the power to create all the money they want.  They're called central bankers.  Since about 2008, they've created many tens of trillions of dollars, just as I've described in the US, Europe, Japan, Britain, China, India, elsewhere.
They give it fancy-sounding, but misleading names such as "monetary stimulus," "quantitative easing," and so on.  But it's really just "theft".
**There are many forms of money.  Some are 'strong' and others are not.**
The USD and other "fiat currencies" are not strong.  They are weak (and doomed).  They lack one or more of the seven essential properties, all of which are necessary for "strong money":  
 * Durable  
 * Divisible  
 * Portable  
 * Recognizable  
 * Fungible  
 * Scarce  
 * Difficult to produce and/or counterfeit  
Gold has all seven properties.  
Bitcoin has all seven propeties.  
The USD and other "regular currencies" (your words, not mine) are lacking.

Let's look at Japan.  30 years of misery.  
I can hear a Keynesian saying, "Yeah, but think how much worse they'd be without zero percent rates and QE..."
Let's move over to Europe.  Ouch.  So far, the long-term effects of zero (or negative) interest rates and QE "money printing" aren't looking so good.
Hop over to the US.  Well, if you're willing to use numbers to lie, you could present your case in favor of zero (or nearly zero) percent interest rates and trillions upon trillions of QE "money printing".  
Lower rates will help rich criminals to continue to rob the general public.
The mainstream media will continue to pump propaganda telling people, in effect, "everything is fine; if you're not prospering greatly it's your own damn fault".  Some will continue to fall for it.  More and more grow angry, but they're not sure exactly what the problem is, nor how to fix it... for example, many thought that electing Trump would "drain the swamp" and get the US onto a path to prosperity... 
Every day, more people are learning what money really is, how it works, and what's wrong with fiat currency and central banking.
When people are doing well, they tend not to be interested in hearing about how evil their central bank is.    When people are struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table, they seem to be more open to the idea that it isn't their fault, that some ultra-rich criminal has rigged the system and is the cause of much misery.  But then, people like that don't have a lot of wealth to protect, that is, they don't have money to park in Bitcoin.
Still, when the economy tanks, there are rich people looking for safety -- I suppose more of them will warm up to Bitcoin.
We shall see.

Every trade entails Risk.  The more you trade, the more likely it is that the risks will win.
Every trade entails cost.  The more you trade, the more you pay, whether the trade works in your favor or against you.
Nobody beats the market, long term.  This is true for stocks, gold, Bitcoin, etc.
For many, every Bitcoin trade entails tax complications and consequences.
Bitcoin's price has more than doubled every year, on average, long term and at this point I see no reason for that trend to stop.  That's more than enough ROI -- therefore, only idiots "trade" their Bitcoin.

\&gt;  alien intervention theories
Ignore Trump.  In case you hadn't noticed, he's just a stooge, a clown, a puppet -- a distraction, a lightning rod, a scapegoat.
Look for the real Oligarchs.  They're neither Dem nor Rep.  They have no "nationality", no allegiance to any stupid flag.  Yet, they FUND both Democrats and Republicans; the Oligarchs don't care who gets elected, because they "win" in either case because they "own" the candidate of each of those two parties.
As they say, "follow the money".  It takes you, eventually, to the Oligarchs and beyond them -- to their "fiat money printing presses".  Think about it: If you could legally create ALL the money you wanted by merely typing a higher bank balance into your computer, wouldn't you end up owning all kinds of things, including but not limited to:
* real estate
* stocks
* bonds
* vaults full of precious metal bars
* natural resources
* rare gems
* art
* mansions, yachts, private jets
* politicians in various countries
* mainstream "news" media outlets
Those Oligarchs are afraid that you'll notice them, then do what I'm doing, saying, "Hey, look!"
They want you to be a good little "obedient worker" who watches their "news" every evening and gets mad at their distraction of the day.  One day it's Trump.  The next day is those "democrats".  The next day it's the "illegals crossing the border," and the next day it's the Iranians or the Russians, then back to Trump - round and round and round...  Fuck that shit.  Kill your television.  Buy and hold Bitcoin because the Oligarchs can't "print" it.

The world has been using fiat currencies for a few decades (1971, Nixon took US off gold standard, for example).
Fiat money has inherent flaws, built-in defects that cause it to self destruct after (typically) a few decades.
The global, fiat-currency-based economy has been on "life support" for over ten years: zero percent interest rates, negative interest rates, $12 Trillion dollars worth of negative interest rate debt, QE-infinity, bail outs, and -- coming soon -- bail **ins**.
We have a small group of people who alone are allowed to legally "print" all the fiat money they want.  Lately, they've "printed" several tens of trillions of dollars worth.  This group and their cronies ***just happen*** to be some of the richest people on the planet \[look up "cantillon effect"\].  Imagine the things **you** could own if you were allowed to "print" all the money you want: stocks, businesses, real estate, resources, private jets/yachts/mansions, mass media outlets, politicians, judges, regulators... Those are the kinds of things those people own.
When those people "print" all that fiat money, they are literally stealing from the rest of us.
**That's the MAIN PROBLEM Bitcoin solves.**
It's not a technology problem, rather, it is a technology-based solution to the biggest scam ever perpetrated.  **Bitcoin provides us with a fair and honest form of money.**

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

Suppose a man has a wallet, and he creates a receiving address.
Suppose that man went to an exchange, told them who he is, linked his bank account, then bought Bitcoin.  When the exchange told him his BTC is available, he immediately sent them all to the receiving address, and then let them sit there.
Suppose later, some "authority" asks that man about his Bitcoin.  Could he not say something like one of the following?
"I spent them."
"I gave them to a homeless person."
"I got scammed."

Fiat currency -- all fiat money -- has built-in defects, inherent flaws which cause it to go to zero, that is, collapse.  Typical this takes a few decades.
Fiat money is doomed.  The entire global fiat money system has been on "life support" for over ten years -- there is no way to fix it.
Bitcoin is **not** fiat money.  Bitcoin is sound money, strong money, will not go to zero, cannot be inflated to infinity.

First, your target audience is first world people with bank accounts.  You need to write for your target audience to be effective.
Second, that's a lot to read, just to answer a relatively simple question.
What gives Bitcoin value?
Let's start with something most people are already familiar with: gold.  Intrinsically, gold's usefulness is very similar to that of copper and aluminum, yet gold costs much more.  Why?  Scarcity.
Gold has all seven properties of "good money":
* Durable
* Divisible
* Portable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* Scarce/rare
* Difficult to produce and/or difficult to counterfeit
Some forms of money are better than others.  Fiat money is lacking some of the seven properties.
Bitcoin has all seven properties and is therefore "good money".  In some ways, Bitcoin is even better than gold:
 \* Gold is very expensive to transport securely.  Bitcoin is very inexpensive to send securely.
 \* Gold is expensive to store securely.  Bitcoin is very inexpensive to store securely.
 \* Gold is heavy, takes up space.  Bitcoin weighs nothing, takes up no space.
 \* Gold sets off metal detectors.  Bitcoin cannot be detected.
 \* Gold is easily confiscated by governments and/or criminals.  Not so for Bitcoin, if stored properly.
Bitcoin is like gold that gets stored on the Internet, and gets sent around the world via the Internet.
These things are what give Bitcoin "value".

@_date: 2019-07-15 21:32:23
Okay.  My more serious answer:
Gresham's law.  The idea: "bad money drives out good".
Back in the mid-1960s, for example, the US stopped minting solid silver coins (dimes, quarters, half dollars, dollars) and started issuing sliver-plated copper "slugs".  Suddenly, the silver coins disappeared from circulation (most of them did).  
Right?  You've got two silver dollars: one is "real" silver, the other sort of looks a lot like the real one, but it's made of copper.  You're going to have to spend one for your meal.  Which one?  Even most dumb people are smart enough to spend the fake coin and keep the silver.
Also, the price of sliver went up.  So you have one coin which goes up in value over time, and a piece of "bad money".  The diner owner will gladly take either, so you give him your "bad money" and keep your "good money" out of circulation.
Similar with Bitcoin.
I get paid fiat money.  At that point, I have fiat in a checking account, and Bitcoin in a wallet.  I believe that the Bitcoin will be worth 100 times what it is today, in just a few years.  So, which one am I going to pay my electric bill with?  Fiat, of course.  Why?  Because the electric company is still glad to accept it.
So, there's "hold vs spend".
Then, there's "hold vs trade".  One idea with trading is that you can somehow time the market.  But in reality, you can't.
Then, there's "hold vs chicken out".  James buys his first Bitcoin, then the price falls 12%, he panics, and sells, then the price doubles over the next few weeks, then James feels stupid, so he buys again, then the price drops 15% and he sells again...  Don't do that.

Fiat money always goes to zero.

There will be fewer debt-driven asset bubbles.  
Fewer people with huge credit card balances.  
There will be less government debt.  
Why?  
Because Bitcoin, unlike fiat money, cannot be created from thin air.  This eliminates things like fractional reserve lending, "Quantitative Easing," "debt monitization", central bank "money printing".  It therefore eliminates inflation and hyperinflation -- which is a form of theft.

Keep up the good work!
Yes.  Here's a small example of their kind of deception: 1 million people lose jobs which paid them about $40K per year with medical and other benefits... "Unemployment" goes up, temporarily.
Some of those people find part time work, paying $20K per year, no benefits.  "Unemployment" goes down.  Some of them are forced to work two or three jobs - the Keynesian "economists" rejoice and count all those minimum wage jobs without benefits as being equivalent to the $40K jobs lost earlier.  The mainstream media trumpets their bullshit, that "unemployment" is down, the economy is "recovering".
Some of those one-million laid off workers have continued to look for similar paying jobs in their field, but there aren't very many, if any.  Eventually, those people no longer qualify for unemployment benefits from the government, and the "economists"  stop counting them as unemployed, even though they have no job.  Bring out the media trumpets again!
Another small example, the "economists" and media will announce that average earnings are up.  Sounds good, until you look at it closer.  Let's say there's a company with a CEO and workers.  The CEO went from earning one billion dollars per year to earning two billion dollars per year.  At the same time, he cut the pay for most of the employees, while reducing their company-paid benefits.  He also laid off a big chunk of people and outsourced the work to another country.  The **average** went up, mathematically, but that number is misleading.  The average went up because of one person, the CEO.  Everybody else is doing worse.

Did you employ a logical fallacy on purpose?
If not, let me explain.  For example, Jim just robbed a liquor store, just now, a few seconds ago... he's just leaving the store.  Is Jim a criminal?  Has Jim committed a crime?  
Of course he's a criminal and not in jail.
Your error is to presume that if somebody is a criminal, they must be in jail, but that is clearly not the case.

In theory, a person could, perhaps, for example, decide to:
* Buy Bitcoin at an exchange
* Immediately transfer it to a wallet
* Save it and/or spend it
* "Forget" to notify the IRS
If audited, tell the IRS, "I sent it from the exchange to a scammer by mistake," (unless you use the same wallet address more than once), or say, "I payed for a service using Bitcoin.  That address belongs to the person who provided the service."  What kind of service?  Smile and say, it was good.  You should try it sometime.  Other than that, take the 5th.  Or, tell them you paid a Voodoo Witch to read you your favorite Dr. Seuss book over skype.
**If you let the BTC sit at the exchange, go up in value, then send it elsewhere, the IRS will find out and they might come after you.**

It has been my experience that most of the people who bring up Bitcoin's energy usage really don't give a fuck about the Earth's environment, they only want to attack Bitcoin somehow.  
Those people really seem to be saying, "I'm deep in debt.  I can't get by, month-to-month, without going deeper into debt.  I have **no savings** to protect from inflation or confiscation.  Since I can't take out a 30 year mortgage to buy Bitcoin, I don't have to fear missing out - I know I'm missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. **I'm jealous; I hate Bitcoin because I can't have any; I hate you because you probably have some and are doing well.**"  Something to that effect.

You're right - trading is only for ignorant fools who believe in mythology.
You mention obtaining a "slight edge".  Bitcoin, so far, long term, has averaged more than 120% per year.  The price has more than doubled.
And somebody needs a "slight edge" on top of that?  No.  Only a fool would fall for such bullshit.
If more than doubling your investment every year, long term, on average, isn't enough for you, then you are fucked up, you have serious mental issues, and a little more money in addition (if it were even possible), isn't going to satisfy you.

I haven't bought any for several months -- I had some unexpected expenses.  I should be starting again, maybe in August.
How I DCA? I pay my bills at the first of the month.  I have a list of bills to pay, and one item on that list is the exchange where I buy BTC.  I go there and buy a specific amount each month, same as if it were a phone bill, for example.  "Pay yourself first," somebody once taught me.
Note: I maintain an emergency cash cushion.  I don't ever want to be in a position where I "must" sell BTC or go into debt.  As I said, I had some unexpected expenses, so I borrowed from my cushion, and have been repaying myself.  I would hate to have to pay interest on a credit card, for example.

This is nothing new.  We've seen the same thing for decades in stock markets, commodities, etc.
"TA" is just marketing bullshit created by desperate stock brokers from decades ago.  They got paid commissions.
No trades = no commission = broker goes hungry.
So they had to generate "churn" to convince people that they would make more money in the long run by paying broker commissions.  It's pure bullshit.

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping*   66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  "Almost as much as the   Czech Rebublic".  They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  One hundred and ten thousand.  Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans.  0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?

So does aluminum, and sand, and nitrogen...
Think again.  Consider that it's possible you don't understand money, what makes something a good form of money.
Consider it carefully.
Consider that the properties of good money are:
 *  Durable
 *  Divisible
 *  Portable
 *  Fungible
 *  Recognizable
 *  Scarce
 *  Difficult to create and/or counterfiet
Using that list, can you see why gold is more valuable and a better form of money than either sand, or aluminum?  Yes.  Gold has all seven properties.  So does Bitcoin.  In fact, Bitcoin is more scarce than gold, and more difficult to counterfeit.

No account at the exchange.  Tell them how much you want to buy, and where to send it.  They gave you an Exact Amount, like $407.31 (say, for $400 of BTC).  Had to get cash, take it to a certain bank, deposit it into an account, in another state.  It had to be the exact amount, or you'd lose your money.
There were no names, no company names, no help desks...
Bitcoins would show up, later, in your wallet.  Typically in less than an hour.

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be  construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
 Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,  nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states  respectively, or to the people.
*Where, oh, where does the US Constitution give the Federal Government the power to dictate what I can buy and sell?  It does not.  So fuck him, fuck Trump.*

It certainly gives us a choice.
There was a time when dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollar coins were made of silver.
Then they decided to make silver plated copper slugs, instead.
It wasn't long until the silver in a dime was worth a lot more than ten cents.
So, you're parking your Chevy in front of a parking meter, in 1969.  You have two dimes in your pocket, but you notice that one of them is pre-1965 and is made of pure silver.  The other is a silver plated slug.  Which of those dimes are you going to put into the parking meter?

Nope.  Those people do not "represent us," and never will, as they've been bought/paid-for by people running the fiat money "printing presses".  We can't just "print up" a few trillion USD, for example, then use it to enrich and empower ourselves by, for example, "buying" politicians on both "sides" of the aisle while bribing judges, hiring former "regulators" and owning most of the mainstream media (so-called "news").
But we don't have to.  We're Bitcoin.  We have something they don't have: Hard Money.  We have the hardest money ever invented, and we're at a time when the flimsy fiat money based global financial system is failing.
We don't have to use their rigged system to try to beat them.  We just need to buy and hold Bitcoin and then wait for their inherently flawed fiat money system to implode of its own accord.

A private key is one thing.  (Ditto for a seed phrase.)
A wallet is another, different thing.
A private key is a string of bits.  A wallet is software running on a computer.  For example, the wallet can use the private key to sign a transaction.  A memory stick cannot run the public-private-key signature "program" -- you need a computer to do that.  Memory is just one part of a computer.

I assume you have no debt.  
I assume you have a nice cash cushion.  For example, people sometimes lose their job (through no fault of their own), and sometimes it takes months, even years, to get back onto your feet.  So, maintain a good, liquid emergency cash cushion.  
After that, yes, at least some of your investment money into Bitcoin.  Don't invest money that you might need (for anything) within the next two or three years, because the price is volatile.  For example, you could buy now, then the price might drop, and suddenly you that money and have to sell your investment at a loss (this applies for more than just Bitcoin).  
Meanwhile: DO learn what Bitcoin actually is, and DO learn the basics of how it works.  You may also find it motivating to prepare for the future by learning about the inherent flaws in the current global financial system.  
Welcome to Bitcoin.  
Get a good wallet.  Practice good security.  Don't store your BTC on anybody else's computer system (exchange, web site, etc.).  Keep a back up copy of your seed phrase in a separate, secure location.  
Don't freak out when the price goes way up or way down - learn patience.

We hold these truths to be self-evident,  
that all men are created equal,  
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  
— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  
— That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, **it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government**, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, **it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**

Right.  Not many.  
Of those "not many," how many of them never bought BTC below $19K?  Even fewer than "not many" would be my guess.  
IF you did happen to buy at/near the all time high, remember that Bitcoin's price once fell from $31 to $2.  Then $265 to about $50.  Then $1200 all the way down (eventually) to $200.  
No guarantee, but it is not unreasonable to expect the price to far exceed $19K in the not too distant future.  So, hold.  Be patient.

TA was born a long time ago, as a way to create "churn".  Before there was an Internet, before there was eTrade, etc., there were stock brokers with telephones.  The brokers only got paid commissions, and only earned commissions when one of their customers executed a trade.  Never mind that frequent trading is bad/dangerous for the investor, churn was good for the salesmen.  So the salesmen came up with bullshit/techniques to entice people to execute trades.  One such technique is called "technical analysis," to make it sound scientific, like designing a rocket to put a weather satellite into orbit.  It's not based on science - if it was, then everybody would get the same answer, and they don't.  It's based upon tricking people into doing unnecessary trades so that salesmen could earn commissions.  It's based upon making people think that the broker "knows more" than the investor.  If they did, why are they working a job like that?  Why aren't they running their own bank?
But people still fall for it, even today.

Gold is certainly a much better form of money than fiat currency.  
Both gold and Bitcoin have all the properties of good, strong money:
* durable
* divisible
* fungible
* portable
* recognizable
* **scarce**
* difficult to produce and/or counterfeit
In many situations, Bitcoin has certain advantages over gold:
* gold is expensive to store *securely;* Bitcoin is relatively inexpensive to store securely
* gold is very expensive and slow to transport securely; Bitcoin is relatively inexpensive to quickly and securely 'transport' around the globe
* gold sets off metal detectors, gold is very heavy and takes up space
* gold can be, and has been confiscated in the past
* gold can be taken by force.  For example, robbers could kill you, then take your gold.  Bitcoin cannot be confiscated by force.  Bitcoin cannot be detected.
Beyond that, look at the long term ROI of gold vs Bitcoin.

I can post videos of the officers of the private banks being grilled... they're out of control.  
I appreciate that we're able to discuss this - it reminded me of the "bad old days" before Bitcoin.  I was so discouraged, frustrated, angry ... disillusioned.  I guess it's good not to live in an illusion, so being disillusioned is a good thing in the long run, but kind of depressing at first.  
Here's another feeling many of us had (still have): disgust.
Another: distrust.
So, when I saw Bitcoin I figured, "Sure, what's the catch?"  A friend send me a link to the White Paper.  I couldn't believe it.  So I read it again.  There had to be a catch, so I examined it again, one piece at a time, looking for the "catch", or the flaw.  I double checked the cryptography being used.  
Then it sank in.
Bitcoin is the real deal, the lifeboat, the escape hatch... a way to say, "Fuck you," to those criminal bankers (central and/or investment bankers).  A place to park wealth, long term, where no dickhead banker, politician, or other criminal could just take it from me.

One way to spot many (but not all) scams: put yourself in their place.  
Let's say you wrote a  computer program that (miraculously) could time the market with enough accuracy to actually beat the market.  Let's say it average's a 5% per week ROI.  You put $1000 in.  
One year later you have $12.6K
Two ears later: $160K
Four years from the time you put $1000 in, you have over $25 million
* Did you need other people to pour money in?  **No**.
* Should you let random strangers in on your venture?  Why would you?  It's just going to complicate things for you - why?  So you can give them money, from your hard work?
So, when clowns come to you and claim, "We can make X% per week for you, give us your money..." you **know they are scammers**.  If they could make that ROI, they would just do it and become very wealthy in a relatively short time.  But they're not -- they're coming to you with their hand out, trying to use your built-in greed to get you emotional.  Stop.  Think.  
**Beware**: the scammers are going to **claim** that they already have all these other investors who are all becoming fabulously rich - **don't fall for that, they're lying.**  Remember: Bernie Madoff's victims put money in, and thought they were earning good returns -- but they lost everything to that scammer.
Instead of imagining how rich you're going to be, put your emotions aside and ask yourself, "**what could go wrong?**"  Guess what, things will go wrong, and when they do, you'll be stuck holding the bag.
Be wise.

1. Bitcoin is still volatile.  Okay.  Fine.  True.  Still, it tends to more than double in price each year, long-term average.  Do you want to bumpy ride to the top or smooth sailing to the bottom of the ocean in a ship with a big, gaping hole in its side?
2. You can't lose all your money unless you try to time the market and/or use leverage and find yourself liquidated due to the volatility.  **If you just buy and hold long term you'll be fine.**
3. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.  Yes.  True.  This way, you'll be able to hold for a long, long time and not lose money in the long run.
4. Fear of missing out?  Actually, I think people should be very afraid of missing out.  The ship is sinking.  It could go down any minute now.  Should you fear missing out on a seat in a lifeboat?  I say, "yes, you should".
5. Do your own research.  Yes.  Know what Bitcoin actually is and the very basics of how it works.  While you're at it, learn about the inherent flaws in the current global financial system built upon the "sands" of fiat currencies.
6. Trading?  Sorry.  Trading is for fools and idiots.  Don't "trade," that is, don't try to sell figuring you'll buy later at a lower price -- there is no need for taking that kind of risk.  Just buy and hold, long term.  Day traders, frequent traders get wiped out eventually by the risks and the fees.  They can also complicate their tax paperwork.  No need to try to time the market to get ahead with Bitcoin -- just hold, long term and enjoy the 100 percent per year ROI average.

If you open a channel with "A", and "A" has a channel open with "B", then you can send a Lightning transaction to "B" (through "A").  
Example, you have a channel open with your favorite gas/petrol station.  That station has a channel open with the "one time coffee shop" -- you can make a L/N payment through the station to the coffee shop.  
Similarly, your transaction might take many hops: through A, B, C, and D before reaching the "one time coffee shop".  
If there is no such route then you might open a new channel w/ the one time coffee shop anyhow because that then "connects" you with everybody they're connected with.

Blocks are mined, on average, every ten minutes.  When your transaction is included in a block, you get one "confirmation".  One confirmation is WAY better than zero.  Two confirmations, better than one.  By the time you get 6 confirmations, it's pretty much a done deal.

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some  "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of  electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're  trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 137 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another  thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin  is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

The best way to avoid being scammed is to slow down and think about it.  Be skeptical.  Don't be in any hurry to assume somebody it giving wealth away - to you - for no reason.

Buying and holding for a long, long time has seen an extremely high ROI, without much risk, without fees, without letting the "tax man" get all into your business.
Long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year. If that isn't enough for you, there is something wring with you.
Don't let the people who sell books, courses, videos, software, coaching, etc. trick you into thinking you can time the market -- you cannot. Don't let the exchange owners trick you into spending a lot of money on trading fees, with false hopes that you'll somehow be the rare "winner" who doesn't lose all/most of his investment in a relatively short time. 
There's no need for that kind of risk-taking; look at the high long-term-average ROI of Bitcoin.
Just buy and hold, long term.

The Constitution does not give rights to people.
The Constitution is a document through which the people spell out the specific powers they're willing to give to the government.  The Constitution limits government.  
People are born with rights.  People agree to give certain, limited powers to government because some government is better than no government.
The government does not have permission to control traffic because we the people have not given that power to it, for example.
My neighbor does not have freedom to grow vegetables on my property without my consent.  If he tries, I can then choose to enlist the help of law enforcement, that is, the government, to enforce property rights as prescribed by law.

*  Don't invest money you might need within the next 3 to 5 years  
*  Consider the risks, rewards  
*  Don't count on being able to time the market  
*  Don't fall for "TA" (technical analysis)

First, no Bitcoin would be created from thin air whenever a loan was made.
Today, with fiat money and fractional reserve lending, fiat money is created from thin air, backed by nothing, when loans are made.  This is unfair.  That can't happen with Bitcoin; Bitcoins must be mined.
In the long run, this will be good -- eliminating things like housing bubbles.
Second, there won't be any banker bail outs.  No central bank will be able to create several trillion Bitcoin to bail out banks who made bad loans.  They won't be able to create even one Bitcoin from nothing.  So, bankers who make bad/stupid loans will go broke, maybe even go to jail (if they break the law).
Third, since there will be no bailouts for "too big to fail" cronies of the central bank, lenders will require adequate collateral for loans.  The borrowers will have to have proven creditworthiness.  Thus, when some dope wants to borrow $800K to speculate on a piece of real estate that's really worth maybe $40K, they'll be DENIED.  If not, that lender is DOOMED.
People won't be able to just run up credit cards, then default on them.  The CC companies will go broke if they lend and lend to idiots who can't pay them back.  So, there will be less "buying on credit" and things will be more affordable.
Only people with a good reason to borrow will borrow -- this will help the economy.  Only people with the ability to repay the loan will be able to borrow.  This is fair.

I like your writing style.  






The tools are software, copies of which can be downloaded and installed almost instantly.  So, there's no "shortage" as in, say, an avocado shortage.  
But you probably mean shortage as in variety and tools that perform different functionality.  Well, yes, and no.  There are tools, and people have been using them for many years in some cases.  
Consider: If a person invests in Bitcoin wisely:
* They'll invest in Bitcoin, not "crypto".  Most "crypto" is crap.  Some is pure scam.  Bitcoin is the real deal.
* They'll want to buy, then hold long term.  They won't need to "manage" anything.  They'll need patience.  Do you have a tool for that?  That would be awesome!
* They won't be trading between cryptocurrencies, they'll just stick with Bitcoin.  They won't be trading back and forth between fiat and Bitcoin, because that's foolish.
So, we have the tools needed.  We have exchanges where people can buy Bitcoin using fiat money.  We have good wallets.  Where's the shortage?

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some  "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of  electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're  trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 137 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.

When we say that a currency is "backed by" something, it means that you can take your "bank notes" to a bank and exchange them for some physical quantity of the thing the notes are "backed by".  
If, today, you walk into a bank with a $100 Federal Reserve note, what can you exchange it for?  Nothing.  You can't get an amount of gold or silver, because the USD is not "backed by" gold or silver.  The USD is not "backed by" anything at all.  In fact the central bankers in collusion with the government have been "printing" the value out of the USD -- they're in the process of "printing" it all the way to zero, just like the Venezuelan Bolivar, just like the Zimbabwe dollar, just like "mark" of the former Weimar Republic, just like the former Soviet Union...

Day traders (frequent traders, people who think they can time the market, people who sell w/ intent to re-buy at a lower price) almost always end up broke.  People who use leverage typically get liquidated in a hurry.
Each trade entails risk.  Each trade entails cost.  Trades may also complicate you tax paperwork.  Eventually the risks and costs win.
Meanwhile, buying and holding for a long, long time has seen an extremely high ROI, without much risk, without fees, without letting the "tax man" get all into your business.
**Long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year.**  If that isn't enough for you, you're a stupid fool and you probably have significant mental illness.

Yes.  We have a small group of people with the sole ability to legally create all the money they want, from thin air, backed by nothing.  They've been using that money to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.  This amounts to theft.  Yes, some of the richest people on earth get to legally steal from the poor, the elderly, the middle class, most of the upper class...

Try not to see Bitcoin as a way to increase your fiat money supply.  Rather, see fiat money as a way to increase your Bitcoin supply.  
Why?  
Because fiat money always ends up becoming worthless.  You might fairly point out that the USD is not worthless.  That is true - for now.  Still, the USD (like other fiat currencies) is on the path to becoming worthless -- it has been following a very familiar pattern.

TA is based upon bullshit.  I'm serious.  It goes back to before Bitcoin, before the Internet and eTrade... there were "stock brokers" who used land-line telephones to generate "churn".  
You see, those stock brokers were just salesmen, and they only got paid by commission, so they only got paid whenever they could convince somebody else to make a trade.  When people just buy and hold long term, the salesmen go hungry.  
So, they crafted this bullshit and gave it a scientific/engineering sounding name, "technical analysis."  They drew lines on charts and threw jargon around to give the customer the **impression** that the salesman had asymmetric information and could help the customer get rich.  But it was all pure bullshit.  
It has subtle variants, such as "rebalancing".  Still, the ultimate objective: get someone to agree to make a trade, then get a commission.  It's not based upon anything other than that.  It's bullshit, whether you can admit it or not.  
**Think about it:** if the salesman *did* have special information, and/or special techniques *which worked often enough*, **why would they be spending all day making cold calls for chump change?  They would merely apply their knowledge and/or technique and become fabulously rich.**  ***BUT THEY DIDN'T.***
Let that soak in.

Nicely explained.  
Sadly, and not your fault, if any of us went to my sister's house tomorrow and proclaimed, in response to her saying, "what gives Bitcoin any value," that "Bitcoin has some level of value because it allows immutable and verifiable transfer of value that settles faster than traditional banking, all on a decentralized payment network ..." you're just going to trigger her insecurities, piss her off, and get her started screaming and yelling until she storms off and slams a door behind her ... at which point her husband mutters, "see what I have to put up with?"  And then we'd all laugh, and then my sister would come back out, over pronouncing one syllable per angry footstep of something unintelligible as she heads into the kitchen and comes out with a big, sharp knife to threaten your life.  
Don't worry, if she stabs you she'll probably stick the knife into something hard, like your upper arm, or a shoulder blade, or your skull.  
I'm not making this up.
Remember, it's not your fault, either.  And what you said is correct and everything, but just not appropriate for your "target audience".
For her, for example, it might be better to compare Bitcoin to "valuable" things she's already familiar with.  She says, "what gives Bitcoin any value?"  I might say, "Good question.  Remember those antique spoons your found at that estate sale?  You paid $30, but they turned out to be worth a lot more?  Right.  They were valuable because they are rare, and made of silver, and antique.  So, what makes silver valuable? What makes gold valuable?  It turns out that the same things that make gold valuable also make Bitcoin valuable, but Bitcoin has a few cool things that make it even better than gold!  It's like gold you can send across the Internet."

Yes - their entire system, the entire global financial systems is  based upon trust, and they have been seriously abusing that trust.  A  lot of people might not know about Bitcoin yet.  They might not  understand fiat money and its inherent flaws, they might not understand  hard money, stock to flow, etc. -- but in their hearts they know that  something isn't right, that they're being screwed by scammers (central  bankers, too-big-to-fail investment bankers, crooked politicians).  The  ECB, the FED, CBOJ, BOE, others should know better that to push people  over the edge.  But then...

Put the burden  of proof back onto them, where it belongs:
"What makes you believe that?  Do you know what Bitcoin is?  Do you understand the basics of how it works?"
Most people will immediately try to change the subject at this point.  Don't let them.  Your objective at this point it to try to get them to realize and admit that they don't have any clue about Bitcoin, what it is, how it works.  Basically, they have no credibility on this topic.   They're merely repeating some simple-minded nonsense because, for them, that's a lot easier than spending a few minutes to actually understand.
Before attempting this, make sure that YOU know what Bitcoin is and the basics of how it works.
If they can admit they don't really understand, take the next step, "Would you like to find out what Bitcoin is, and the very basics of how it works?"  If they never get to that point, or they do but don't want the facts, too bad for them.  Don't discuss Bitcoin with them.  Perhaps leave it at something like, "I'd like to encourage you to take a little time to learn what Bitcoin actually is and the very basics of how it works -- for your sake."

Too many overly simplistic assumptions.
The biggest one is that the investor suddenly acquires a huge lump of cash.  Well, okay, that does happen to a few lucky individuals.
Another assumption is that financial bubbles don't exist.  But they do.  For instance, we are currently experiencing bubbles in stocks, bonds, and real estate.  Oh, try to DCA real estate...  Bubbles always pop.  It is better wait and purchase assets after a bubble has popped than at/near the peak of the bubble.
Another assumption is that the money supply is stable, that the central banks are reasonable, that the government is responsible.  Right now, the central banks are in deep, deep doo-doo.  For instance, negative interest rates.  For instance, Q.E.  Global debt to GDP.  Unfunded liabilities, etc.
Another assumption in that article: the investor is going to put it all into one asset.  That's rarely wise.  Typically, it is better to diversify.
Another bad assumption in that article is that the investor is young.  Yeah, if you're young and you make a huge investment blunder, you'll have decades of time during which you can scramble to recover.  If you're nearing retirement... different story - you probably can't afford to fuck up and then wait 40 or 50 years for the market average to smooth things over.
Another bad thing about that article is that it mentions stock prices going up without taking inflation into account.  That can be dangerous, especially during times like these where central banks are "playing with fire" and likely to burn down the economy with hyperinflation.

I rightly pointed out that over one year Bitcoin has beat stocks, by quite a bit.  I also pointed out that over the last five years, Bitcoin has beat the living shit out of stocks, and mentioned that the stock market has been on a form of "life support".
Central banks have been stealing from you.  No, not your local bank branch.  The Federal Reserve  Learn the difference.  Learn about the "money printing," "debt monetization," "quantitative easing," zero percent interest rates (for central bank cronies, but not for you), negative interest rates, the Federal Reserves current "repo" activities.  
There's a lot of serious shit happening at this time, you seem ignorant to it all.  That's okay.  But not that it's been brought to your attention, you owe it to yourself to go learn a few things.  I would recommend, for example:  
 * Learn what Bitcoin actually is (no, you DON'T know, even if you THINK you do)  
 * Learn the basics of how Bitcoin works  
 * Learn about money, the history of money, the various forms it has taken in the past  
 * Learn about the inherent flaws in fiat money  
 * Learn about the "crimes" of the CENTRAL Banks

Even if Walmart customers wanted such information, a traditional database system would be far superior for tracking it.

Still, if not for the scarcity and durability, the price of gold would be on par with things like aluminum, copper, zinc.  
In other words, gold isn't valuable because people make jewelry out of it.  No.  People make gold jewelry because gold is valuable.  
Most, nearly all of gold's extreme value is due to its suitability as a form of money.
Technically, Bitcoin "satoshis" could be further subdivided if necessary.  By the way, you can't do that with gold - not at a practical scale.  With Bitcoin, you could easily have micro-satoshis.

The price of Bitcoin is volatile.  It goes up.  It goes down.  
An extreme example: You buy Bitcoin with next month's rent money, expecting the price to go up soon.  But the price goes down, a lot.  Then your rent is due, and you are forced to sell at a loss.  A few days later, the price of Bitcoin goes up again...  Don't put yourself into this kind of situation.  
A more typical example: You are living from paycheck to paycheck and you owe money for an auto loan and you owe money for credit card balances.  You have no savings.  Your aunt dies and leaves you several thousand euros.  You buy Bitcoin with them.  Bitcoin goes up a bit.  Yay!  You hold.  Then, after some time, Bitcoin goes down.  You keep holding.  Then you lose your job, through no fault of your own.  Jobs are hard to find.  You are unable to pay your bills.  You don't want your car to be repossessed.  You are forced to sell Bitcoin at a loss.  Don't put yourself into this kind of situation.  
You want to be able to hold your Bitcoins, no matter what, for many years  if necessary.  That is ideal.  This is the situation to strive for.

When your car needs gas, do you just park it for a week, a month, a few years... because the price of gas will be lower then?  No.

The log scale doesn't prove anything.  Here's why it is sometimes used:
Suppose you have a price which goes up 50% for four years in a row.
                     Percent     Dollar
                     Increase    Increase
    Year  Amount     Per Year    Per Year
    0     $100       --          --
    1     $150       50%         $50
    2     $225       50%         $75
    3     $337.50    50%         $112.50
    4     $506       50%         $170
Notice, in the third year that the balance increased more than twice the amount during the first year ($112 vs $50), but it went up the same percentage (50%) in both cases.  Looking at it one way, the balance seems to increase faster and faster, but the rate of growth (50%) is constant.
Let's look at the log(amount):
    Year  Amount    log(Amount)
    0     100       2.0
    1     150       2.176
    2     225       2.352
    3     337.5     2.528
    4     506       2.704
Notice that the log(amount) goes up at a steady 0.176 per year.

There are about 2000 1-word combinations.
There are about 4,000,000 2-word combinations.  How did we get that?  2000 X 2000 = 4,000,000
There are more than 8 billion 3-word combinations: 2000 X 2000 X 2000
Sixteen trillion 4-word combinations.
It turns out, the number of 12-word combinations is 5,444,517,870,735,015,415,413,993,718,908,291,383,296

For  example, Bitcoin's long term, average ROI has been more than 100  percent per year.  In other words, on average over many years, the price  of Bitcoin doubles each year, roughly.
Let's run that out for, say, 15 years.
Start with an initial investment of $200.
    Year    Value 
    0       $200 
    1       $400 
    2       $800 
    3       $1,600 
    4       $3,200 
    5       $6,400 
    6       $12,800 
    7       $25,600 
    8       $51,200 
    9       $102,400 
    10      $204,800 
    11      $409,600 
    12      $819,200 
    13      $1,638,400 
    14      $3,276,800 
    15      $6,553,600 
    
Note: extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor.  "Your mileage may vary."  Hopefully, the long term trend will continue - I see no reason for it to stop any time soon.

First, warnings:
* Get a copy of the code, then run it on a machine that is not connected to the Internet.
* Never, ever connect that machine to the Internet again.
* Do not discard or recycle that machine.
* Make sure that machine has no bluetooth or wifi or other wireless ability.
* Never send your private key to a computer printer.
* Get a high quality die (from a good pair of dice).
* I suggest rolling the die across 4 to 6 feet of carpet, against a wall - roll it hard, you want "good entropy".  Carefully record each roll (1..6).
* Roll the die exactly 99 times.  Record each roll.  The order of the rolls matters.
* Click on the "Wallet Details" link.  Enter your 99 numbers from the die rolls.  Click "view details".
* Write the private key by hand, in ink on good paper.  Write the public address, too.
* Make two (or more) copies of your written key(s) -- store them in separate, secure locations in case of fire, flood, etc.
* Double check that you wrote down the private key correctly - remember that the key is CASE SENSITIVE.  Write as clearly as possible.
* Double check both copies.
* Triple check by reading the key you wrote and typing it into the tool (click "Wallet Details" link.  Make sure you get the exact same public address.  Quadruple check - do it again.
* Don't lose your papers with the private key(s) written thereupon.  Don't store them in a safe deposit box, either.  Don't store them in a safe -- that's the FIRST place a burglar will look.  Store them where they won't get wet or eaten by insects or rodents.  Store them in separate locations so they don't both burn or get flooded, etc.
* There are significant risks.  It is easy to fuck up.  When you fuck up, you lose Bitcoin.  Learn by sending/receiving small amounts of BTC.  Make sure you're able to get BTC into your paper wallet AND BACK OUT AGAIN before you store significant amounts.
* Consider using the BIP39 pass phrase w/ 24 words, instead.
* Remember: if you fuck up, you lose your money.

I learned to never day-trade well before Bitcoin existed.  I have never day-traded Bitcoin.  Frequent traders almost always end up losing their investment.  I have never sold any amount of BTC.

You stumbled upon a special place.  A place full of enthusiasts who not only understand one of the greatest things ever invented, but who are willing to spend their time and energy to encourage you to learn about it, to begin to understand it... people who are willing to explain things, to answer honest questions about one of the greatest things ever invented.  People are here to help you, a stranger, out of the kindness of our hearts.  We're not here to hurt you.  We're not here to attack you.  We're here to help.  
Would you like to find out why so many really smart people are so enthusiastic about Bitcoin?  
Or do you want to keep asking questions which demonstrate your severe lack of understanding?  For example, Bitcoin did not exist 15 years ago.  So, your question says, to people like me who know this stuff well, "This guy completely lacks knowledge."  Our response is, "Well, gee, if he knew even 15 percent of what I know, he'd be a big fan, too.  He'd see what an amazing opportunity he's been missing.  He can be so glad someday that he didn't completely miss the boat... and he'll probably end up finding ways to help others understand and appreciate Bitcoin."  
So, let me answer your question in two ways:  
*  First, your question doesn't make sense because Bitcoin is less than 15 years old  
* Second, do you want to learn the truth about Bitcoin, or not?

**Get this: merely being "digital" is not what makes Bitcoin special or different.** If China, or anybody else launches a "digital currency" (or SAYS they're going to) you can know it's going to be a big piece of shit. 
I would like to encourage you to learn what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works, and the inherent flaws in fiat money.

Look here.  Most "money" is already "digital" and has been for many years.  About 90% of all USD and over 90% of all fiat currency exists only in digital format -- on centralized databases/ledgers.
Let me use an analogy.  Suppose somebody made car.  Which of the following would be necessary for the car to be able to be driven:
* a working engine
* wheels
* a road to drive upon
Answer: all of them.  You build a car without wheels, and your car is worthless, for example.  
So, when a government, or anybody else comes up with yet another shitcoin, people like me say, "Well, is it decentralized?  If not, it's a piece of worthless shit.  Is it built upon an immutable blockchain protected by proof of work, where anybody is free to mine?  huh?  Yeah, all of those things are essential.  
Even **if** a central bank came up with a decentralized, permissionless, uncensorable money based upon an immutable blockchain protected by proof of work... they'd **still be just another shitcoin, and worthless.  Why?  Because it would be a Bitcoin copy.  Because there is limited Bitcoin, but unlimited 'copies'.**
Also, smart people lost "faith" in central banks over ten years ago.

Suppose we each have 1000 BTC.  You keep yours on Coinbase.  I keep mine in an offline hardware wallet, with the passphrase on paper.  
One day, your government decides they don't like you, or, they don't like Bitcoin.  The government tells Coinbase, "give us halfman413's Bitcoins or we'll put you in jail for a long, long time."  Coinbase is going to hand over 'your' 1000 BTC.  You lose.  What are you going to do about it?  Complain?  Vote for a third party candidate?  Write a letter to the editor?  Good luck.  
Okay, suppose instead that a hacker cracks Coinbase and takes a significant amount of BTC.  Coinbase might go broke, bankrupt... they might say, "everybody takes a haircut".  Now you only have 200 BTC on Coinbase.  What are you going to do?  
Okay, suppose that people inside Coinbase decide to just take a bunch of BTC and "disappear". Poof - your money is gone.  What are you going to do?  
Or, suppose one day you go to log into Coinbase, and they say, "We don't know you, you have no login, you have no BTC here..."  What are you going to do?  Hire lawyers and go after them?  Probably.  Hopefully, you'll have all kinds of proof that they were holding your 1000 BTC.  But what if, instead, they let you log in, but your balance is zero, and there's a withdrawal that you didn't make... they say, "Yes, you sent them away, here's our proof..."  What are you going to do?
Meanwhile, my hypothetical 1000 BTC are protected by private keys which are controlled by me, and me alone.  To get the private keys, you have to know my 24 word pass phrase, which is written on a little piece of paper and hidden somewhere.  There's a backup copy, also on a piece of paper, also hidden in a separate, secure location.  Those papers could be just about anywhere, where only I know the locations.  How could the government take it from me?  They can't.  How can a hacker find them?  He can't.  How can anybody else take them?  They'd have to find one of the slips, and know what it is and  how to use it.  Okay - if you're extra paranoid, break the 24 words into two 12-word lists, have four slips of paper, and hide them all in separate locations.  Somebody would have to discover both parts of a matching pair... if you hide them right, that's not going to happen.  Also, I don't know about you, but I'd memorize those 24 words.  
You don't like paper.  
I don't like people being able to steal my money.

Bitcoin doubles in price each year, long term, on average -- with no risk necessary.  
Lending Bitcoin is extremely risky, and when they're gone, they're gone forever.  It is not necessary to take that risk.  This is a fact, not a mere "opinion."

Rather than using Bitcoin to increase your fiat money, use fiat money to increase your Bitcoin supply.
Bitcoin IS money.  
Bitcoin is a \[new\] kind of money.  Fiat currency is a kind of money.  Gold is a kind of money.  
There are serious, inherent flaws in fiat money.  Thus, to see Bitcoin as a way to increase your supply of fiat money... you can do better than that.
Learn the history of money, then learn what Bitcoin actually is and the basics of how it works.  You will glad you did someday - I promise.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:
* there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.
* The swindler receives money from people
* The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return. That money is NOT invested. There is no money-making business venture. Any returns are paid from the swindled money.
* The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a big, fat lie.
* The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.
* A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a "crash".
* A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.
Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.

Yes.  It's been a great long term, buy-and-hold thing.  It goes up and down but the long term average is for it to double in price each year.   After 15 years at that rate, even a $200 initial investment can be worth millions.

Day Trading??  
More than 98% of "traders" end up as failures, usually in a short period of time.  
In the long run, trading fails.  
Day traders (frequent traders, people who think they can time the market, people who sell w/ intent to re-buy at a lower price) almost always end up broke. People who use leverage typically get liquidated in a hurry.  
Each trade entails risk. Each trade entails cost. Trades may also complicate you tax paperwork. Eventually the risks and costs win.  
Meanwhile, buying and holding for a long, long time has seen an extremely high ROI, without much risk, without fees, without letting the "tax man" get all into your business.Long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year. If that isn't enough for you, you're a stupid fool and you probably have significant mental illness.  
Don't let the people who sell books, courses, videos, software, coaching, etc. trick you into thinking you can time the market -- you cannot. Don't let the exchange owners trick you into spending a lot of money on trading fees, with false hopes that you'll somehow be the rare "winner" who doesn't lose all/most of his investment in a relatively short time. There's no need for that kind of risk-taking; look at the high long-term-average ROI of Bitcoin.  
Just buy and hold, long term.

 Broker Pledges Client Funds Risk
It is not an exaggeration to say that certain investors, traders, and speculators (and perhaps even you) could one day log into a brokerage, commodities, or futures account only to discover that the assets they had spent a lifetime accumulating were gone, seized by the firm's creditors because the broker has pledged client funds as collateral and defaulted on the debt.
In such a situation, the lost assets would not be protected by [SIPC insurance]( While partial recovery may be possible through the bankruptcy courts, there are no guarantees. The process would undoubtedly take years, and it could be extraordinarily stressful.

All over the globe there are people who have been fucked over by some of the richest people on earth, and/or the descendants of those people.  \[Read, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man," by Perkins.  Read, "America's Secret War," by Friedman.  Etc.\]  
The Oligarchs are cowards.  They went around hurting, killing, robbing, polluting, locking people into terrible prisons.  In some places, they're still there, doing their evil.  Why?  For even more money -- oil and other natural resources.  Sometimes, apparently, just to show the rest of the world how "big and tough" the Oligarch crowd is..  But then they fail.  Either way, they leave a broad path of people seeking vengeance.  Those victims aren't out to get people like us.  They're out to get the "masterminds" who killed their relatives, for example.  The Oligarchs know this.  They're afraid to face the consequences of their own evil actions.  
The Oligarchs think they can protect themselves by spying on and/or restricting the freedoms of the rest of us, even people like you and me.  9-1-1 really put the fear of death into the Oligarchs.  So, the Oligarchs demand that payments be tracked, for example (in addition to all that TSA bullshit, etc.).  
So now, you and I can't just buy some Bitcoin, because a "terrorist" might "hide" by using Bitcoin to buy bomb-making supplies, or to pay assassins, buy a jet to turn it into a missile, etc.

Unless you are a total expert, unless you really understand the underlying technologies, stay away from alt-coins.  
Sure, with stocks it's way better to invest in an index fund based upon stocks from hundreds of companies.  But cryptocurrencies aren't stocks.  Thus, the usual "diversify" advice does not apply.  
Think of it more like metals.  Do you want to buy and hold bars of iron, aluminum, zinc, and tin just because gold is precious?  I hope not.  Similarly, unless you really, really understand this space, just stick to Bitcoin.  (Do yourself a favor.)

Actually, you can't time the market; nobody can.  
The more you buy and sell, trying to time the market, the sooner you'll end up losing your investment.  
Besides, Bitcoin's long term average ROI is over 100%.  Do you think that's not enough?  You think you need to take risks to make just a little bit more?  Then, you'd be fucked up, crazy, right?  Yes.  
So, who is promoting the frequent trading?  The people who own the trading exchanges, and the people they've managed to brainwash.  
Don't be a sucker - just hold, long term.  Let your patience be rewarded someday.

Here's the deal.  Most money, about 90 percent of it, only exists in digital form.  That is, less than 10 percent is actual cash.
Yes, they could "print" more physical notes, but that would take a long time and require a lot of planning an coordination.  If, for example, a lot of people went to their banks tomorrow and demanded cash, they would certainly create trouble for the banks -- it would demonstrate to a lot of people, "see?  Your money isn't really in that bank.  It's all part of a really big scam."

Reasons I to own Bitcoin include, but are not limited to:
* Cannot be confiscated
* Does not set off metal detectors
* Takes up no space; weighs nothing

* Very inexpensive (and fast) to securely send to anybody on the planet
* Nobody knows whether you own any, or not

Learn enough so that you can see for yourself that Bitcoin is not something you use to increase your fiat money supply, rather, fiat money is something you use to increase your Bitcoin supply.  
Ideally, you'll want to have a better than average understanding of money, and the history of money.  You'll want to understand why people used gold for money, then why people stopped using gold for money.  You'll want to know the difference between money "backed by" something, and fiat money.  You'll want to understand the history of fiat money, and its inherent flaws which cause it to have a 100% failure rate.  
You'll want to understand what Bitcoin actually is, and the very basics of how it works.  You'll need to learn to store it and transport it securely.

"I can predict future price movements.  Watch my video..."  When I've been dumb enough to click... they're all, "Here are my sponsors.  Be sure to check them out.  Also, be sure to like and subscribe and sign up for updates and email spam."  Let's stop and think about these guys.
If they can time the market:  
1.  Why are they spending all week filming, editing, and promoting youtube videos (as opposed to applying their "TA" to make some serious dough)?  Why aren't they out sailing they yachts?
2.  Why do they need sponsors?  They should be bloody fucking rich, and they should be saying things like, "Join me in supporting the Water Project, and these other charities..."  They're trying to monetize youtube videos because they're broke!  They're broke because TA is bullshit.
Every time a person tries to "time the market" they take on risk.  They also accumulate fees.  In many cases, they complicate their tax paperwork.

Functional purpose?  No, that doesn't give much, if any value to gold.  If not for gold's scarcity, its price would be similar to aluminum and copper.  
Speaking of scarcity -- there's a lot of gold floating in the oceans.  One day somebody is going to figure out how to extract it **economically**.  Or, a huge gold mine will be discovered.  Possibilities, but not likely.
Remember: people ***used to use gold as money****,* but they stopped.  They stopped for reasons.  Those reasons still exist: **it is expensive to store and transport gold** ***securely*****, and relatively slow.** There are gold coated tungsten bars, for example.  
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is very inexpensive to store and transport securely.  Compared to gold, it is lightning fast.

All the space, for infinity in every direction.  All the energy -- think of all the light and heat flowing out of each of those stars.  The energy required to move galaxies around... all that energy came from somewhere, or somebody.  All the matter, every proton, electron, neutron... they didn't create themselves.  All the immutable laws of nature which govern all matter, energy, forces, and interactions between.  Those laws didn't create themselves -- somebody designed it to be this way.

It can help to replace one bad habit with a good (or at least less bad) habit.  For example, I had an aunt who quit smoking, but needed something to do with her hands, so she learned card tricks until the cigarette addiction was broken.  
In your case, you'll need something to take your mind off of BTC price.  Maybe find some puzzles to do (on line, books).  Eg, sudoku, kenken, hotpepperpuzzles, crossword puzzles.  
Sometimes meditation (self-hypnosis) works.  The idea is to learn deep relaxation, then while deeply relaxed, visualize yourself in the future, smiling, and having all those BTC that you successfully held for years and years.  Once you're learned the relaxation technique, you can often just take a deep breath or two when you start to feel the stress, the urge... it becomes a conditioned response, but it can take weeks to learn.  It's worth it.
Risky, but maybe better than trusting yourself, let somebody else hold your BTC for you, until you've found a way (or gotten help) to deal with your urge to trade.

No, not in the US.  Arbitrary seizures are totally unconstitutional.  
The sheep in the US have been brainwashed to believe that government exists to take stuff from others and give it to them.  They've been brainwashed to believe that the government needs to violate our rights in order to protect us.  They've been brainwashed to believe that the government is all powerful and gives us certain, limited rights as the government sees fit.  They've been brainwashed to believe that the government always knows best.  They believe that bigger government is better.

Stop and think for a minute or so.  What is the long-term average ROI for holding Bitcoin?  Do you know?  I will tell you: it is over 100% per year.  Okay?  
People brag about a stock market averaging 7 or 8 percent ROI.  People bragged when home prices went up 10 or 15 percent per year, which was so high it turned out to be unsustainable.  
Here you are, holding an asset when has, on average, long-term returned 100 percent or more.  But you think that's not enough?  If 100% ROI is not enough, then 105% ROI isn't going to be enough, and maybe you should find somebody to manage your finances for you.  To get that extra few percent requires you to take risks, and pay fees, and the odds are against you in that case.\]

Right.  So, not long ago I thought about visiting Lebanon, because of some people I'd met (super nice, excellent people), and their food (oh my god, delicious).  I did a bit of research and said, "No.  I can't go there.  It's too risky."  
Now, if I took some risk because there was likely to be a significant reward... that would be different.  Maybe I would decide it's worth it.  But, for a very small or no reward (other than the opportunity to visit as a tourist), not worth it for me at this time.

Ask yourself, why is counterfeiting illegal?
Or, consider this: A central bank "creates" $1 Trillion dollars and "lends" it to Mr. X at zero percent interest.  Mr. X then buys one trillion dollars worth of assets, that is, actual wealth.  He buys real estate, stocks, precious metals, rare gems, a yacht, a helicopter, an exotic car, some fur coats.  Where did that "wealth" (the R/E, etc.) come from?  It did not materialize from thin air, but the money he used to purchase it did.  What did Mr X do to "earn" all that wealth?  Nothing.  All that actual wealth was unfairly transferred to him.  Transferred from whom?  The rest of us.

# Why quantum computers do not pose a risk to bitcoin. (The quantum fud campaign has worked in the past and it worked this time. People need to learn to rebuke this false narrative)
**The claim:** Quantum computers can hack bitcoin and its right around the corner.
There is no known way that quantum computers can break SHA256 (only the signing elliptic curve/ECDSA). So **cold wallets will always be safe** (this means you have not made an outgoing transaction in that wallet)
**This also means you will always be safe in actively making transactions** as long as wallet providers upgrade the functionality to constantly move your funds to a new address on each transaction (this already exists in several wallets). Its a simple software update.
There is a larger discussion on upgrading bitcoin, the fact that quantum computers are not even close to being able to crack ECDSA, etc. But I'm just going to leave it at what I said above. **Your Bitcoin is not at risk from quantum computing.**

First, Welcome to Bitcoin.  
**Nutshell**: Learn what Bitcoin actually is, learn the basics of how it works.  Learn how to buy and store Bitcoin securely (don't get scammed or hacked).  Extra credit: learn about the history of money, and learn about the inherent flaws which doom the current global financial system.
Here's an **excellent introductory video** about Bitcoin:
Highly recommended book: "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous

More than 98% are failures.
In the long run, trading fails.
Day Trading  
Day traders (frequent traders, people who think they can time the market, people who sell w/ intent to re-buy at a lower price) almost always end up broke. People who use leverage typically get liquidated in a hurry.  
Each trade entails risk. Each trade entails cost. Trades may also complicate you tax paperwork. Eventually the risks and costs win.  
Meanwhile, buying and holding for a long, long time has seen an extremely high ROI, without much risk, without fees, without letting the "tax man" get all into your business.Long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year. If that isn't enough for you, you're a stupid fool and you probably have significant mental illness.  
Don't let the people who sell books, courses, videos, software, coaching, etc. trick you into thinking you can time the market -- you cannot. Don't let the exchange owners trick you into spending a lot of money on trading fees, with false hopes that you'll somehow be the rare "winner" who doesn't lose all/most of his investment in a relatively short time. There's no need for that kind of risk-taking; look at the high long-term-average ROI of Bitcoin.  
Just buy and hold, long term.

Safe Deposit boxes are not safe, sadly.  
Safest long-term hold strategy: keep the 24 word seed phrase written down (double, triple checked for accuracy) and store two copies in relatively secure, but separate locations (in case of fire, flood, etc.)  It should be easy to hide a small slip of paper with 24 words written on it.  Then, if that same pass phrase is in, or was in any hardware device, burn that device in a hot bon fire.  When you need to access your Bitcoin later, you'll have to buy a new hardware wallet and enter the phrase.  
If you might want to spend/give Bitcoin in the meanwhile, keep a separate "hot" wallet, with easy, convenient access, with a relatively small amount of BTC...
Don't store the pass phrase in a safe deposit box.  Despite the name, they are not safe.  Don't store it in a bible, either.  A smart thief would look there - it's way too obvious.  Don't store your seed phrase in a safe, either.  Again, that's where crooks look... it's just too obvious.

Yes.  After 2008/9, nothing got fixed -- the root causes of 2008/9 still exist, but have been amplified.  The next downturn will be the worst in history.  
Instead of fixing broken things in the financial system, new asset bubbles were blown, including real estate, stocks, and bonds.  Prices of those assets are expected to deflate, that is, pop.  The bubble will pop.
When the shit hits the fan, you will want "money" (not debt, not nailed-down-easy-to-tax real estate).  You are likely to also want (or need) mobility.  Again, having yourself chained to real estate hampers your mobility, hinders your ability to go someplace else where jobs are.

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera-Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera-Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.  110,000 vs 63.  
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

And when your car is old and dented, like mine, other drivers stay out of your way - those fools are thinking, "Look out!  It's an uninsured poor person, probably in this country illegally."  
Yes.  I pack my own lunches, too, except for special occasions.  
But there has to be balance.  I do go to the bar, maybe once per week, and I pay $15 plus tip and tax for a drink, and I pay $18 for about $3 worth of food.  It's fun.  Then I go home and have a 75 cent shot of vodka.

Suppose Bob has 100 BTC.  He sends it to Alice, then immediately sends it to another address he controls, and another, and another.  Which of the four addresses now has the 100 BTC?  
Because of the way the Internet works, some participants will see the second of Bob's four transactions first.  Others might see the third, and so on.  So, who decides which of Bob's four transactions happened first?  There is no central authority to decide.  
The consensus is needed so that eventually everybody can agree upon the same answer.  In this case, one of Bob's four transactions will end up in the longest chain, and everybody will agree -- that is where the 100 BTC went to.

Rather than looking at Bitcoin as a way to increase your fiat money supply, look at fiat money as a way to increase your Bitcoin supply.  
The current global financial system, built upon fiat currencies issued by irresponsible central bank is dying.  For example: negative interest rates.  For example: Quantitative Easing (QE).  
Look at the money situations in Venezuela and Zimbabwe, then take a deep breath and realize that the same kind of thing is coming to your country, your currency.  Yes, it's true and it's happening whether you acknowledge it or not.

Think about it: the long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year.  
If you know anything about math, you'll know that doubling your money every year for ten or fifteen years will make you very, very rich from even a modest initial investment.  
If you know anything about investing, you'll know that 100 percent per year is beyond fantastic -- it's orgasmic, in fact.  You'll also know that every trade entails risk, and a fee; that these risks and fees eventually wipe out those who trade frequently under the belief that they can time the market, or that their "TA" is somehow good enough.  Fools and their money are soon parted.
Bluntly: only a fucking idiot would pass up 100% ROI per year (long term average) in order to have "fun" gambling as a "day trader".  
If 100 percent per year isn't enough for you, then you have serious mental issues which no amount of money will ever fix.  
Be wise; buy and hold, long term, and grow rich, patiently.

What are you trying to do?  Make some money?
Gambling, as you are apparently planning on doing - that's not a good plan.  
You want to end up rich.  I want you to become rich, too.  That's why I taking the time to write this.
* Get a job.  Get experience, learn things.  Get a promotion or a better job.  Repeat.
* Get out of debt, then stay out of debt.
* Save an emergency cash cushion, so you can stay out of debt.
* Save up "investment" funds.
* Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets.
* Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.
* Be patient.
* Realize that frequent trading is a good way to lose all/most of your investment.
* Realize that "technical analysis" is nothing but bullshit.
* Learn to have a really good bullshit detector.
* Be frugal.
* Be wise.
* Beware of scams.
* Notice that Bitcoin, just buying and holding, long term has averaged more than 100% ROI per year.  If that's not enough ROI for you, then nothing will ever be enough for you - you have serious mental issues in this case and should seek medical advice -- for example, have you had any serious head injuries?  Does mental illness run in your family?
* Buy and hold Bitcoin, long term.  Be patient.  Enjoy the long-term returns.
* Keep working, keep being frugal, keep investing in Bitcoin and other things (not alt-coins, rather S&amp;P500 index, gold, maybe real estate, etc.)
That's how you end up wealthy.
**Note**: I did NOT say "that's how you end up happy".  If you're unhappy and you think that accumulating a lot of money is going to make you happy - in that case, please let me encourage you to work on your unhappiness issue FIRST - learn to be happy, all the time, even if you're poor, THEN accumulate wealth.  Trust me on this, please.

Places to get Bitcoin include:
* Create an account at an exchange, get 'verified', connect your banking account, transfer fiat from bank to exchange, buy Bitcoin at exchange; install a wallet, transfer Bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet.  Phew.  Creating the account and installing the wallet only have to be performed once.
* Buy it from a person, face to face: install a wallet (on a smart phone), meet the person, hand them cash, wait for one or two 'confirmations'.
* Have somebody donate it to you: install a wallet, give the donor a receiving address (generated by your wallet software), wait for Bitcoin to arrive.
* Earn Bitcoin: get a job which pays in Bitcoin; get a wallet... give boss a receiving address from your wallet.
* Sell something for Bitcoin: get a wallet, generate a receiving address; post an ad (craigslist?), specify in the ad that you only take Bitcoin, buyer shows up, sends Bitcoin to your address, you check for at least one confirmation
For only $5 worth, maybe try the "sell something" route.

Ten years ago it was legitimate to question the long-term viability of Bitcoin.  By now, we've seen that it has what it takes to survive.
Bitcoin provides "digital scarcity".  As good as gold is, Bitcoin is better in many ways.  Thus, to me (at least) your question is a little bit like, "What if the price of gold goes to zero?"  Seriously.
There's a great book, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous -- well worth it.

First, TA is subjective. As opposed to math or science, with TA everybody gets his/her own "answer". It's more like reading tea leaves, palm reading, or visiting a "psychic". Of course, the people who pay to visit the psychic will swear that the psychic is real, but it isn't real.
Second, TA is firmly rooted in bullshit, by professional liars -- desperate stock brokers trying to generate "churn" (to earn fees) by tricking gullible people into believing that the broker has special knowledge, tools, abilities, etc. Think about it: IF the broker had some sort of advantage, they could quickly become excessively wealthy, but there they are... trying to generate "churn" to earn fees to pay their bills. Guess they DON'T have a special, market-beating advantage after all.
Third, TA presumes that tomorrow's price direction depends only upon recent price changes.  That presumption is false.  Tomorrow's price depends upon tomorrow's supply and tomorrow's demand, which are partly influenced by recent price changes, but mostly influenced by events - events which have nothing whatsoever to do with recent price changes.  For example, the leader of a country decides to make a tweet, or some other government announces a new law/policy dealing with Bitcoin and or economics...  or a central bank decides to make an announcement about interest rates, QE, etc.
You can't just draw lines on a chart and predict the future.  Only fools believe in such.

We can't have a "recession".  Note: "recession" has a specific definition.  
Recessions have normally been caused by a normal "business cycle".  
What the mainstream media has been calling "the great recession" is no recession - no - the entire global financial system was on the very brink of collapse, mere hours away from completely, irreversibly collapsing.  
Measures taken by central banks and governments as a result of the near-collapse did not "fix" things -- in fact, they prolonged the inevitable and ensured that the next downturn would be cataclysmic.  That's were we are now.  The global economy/financial system is now like a rowboat full of dogs, floating down a river toward a gigantic waterfall with huge rocks waiting at the bottom.  The dogs are barking, but there is no way to escape the inevitable plunge of death.  
"Money" as most people have come to know it, that is, fiat currencies, is dying.  It's not quite dead, but it has been on "life support" for over ten years, and pretty soon "the big one" will arrive.  Poof.  Dead.  
It won't be pretty.  
And...   
...it certainly won't be a mere "recession".

Owing and holding Bitcoin is wise.
Frequent trading is for fools and ignorant idiots.  You can learn this fact the easy way, or the hard way.  
Each and every trade entails **risk** and **fees** and is likely to complicate your tax paperwork.  Like gambling at a race track or at a casino, eventually you lose - the accumulated **risk** and **fees** make it less and less likely that the trader will come out ahead, and if the trader does come out ahead, the tax man is there with his hand out.  
Forget "technical analysis" -- it's bullshit.  It does not work, though there are plenty of liars who will tell you otherwise, just like there are plenty of trolls on the Internet.  You can't predict the future by drawing lines on a price chart -- it doesn't work that way.
Historically, Bitcoin has provided superb ROI (return on investment) - long term average is more than 100% per year -- without the risks, fees, or tax consequences of frequent trading.  That should be much more than enough ROI for any sane person.  So just buy, and hold (in your own wallet).  Be patient.  Don't an idiot.

You spent nearly twelve thousand dollars on something you have no understanding of?
Wow.  Welcome to Bitcoin.
My suggestion: spend some time to learn what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works.  It doesn't take long.
Here's a good place to get started right away:  
A great book is "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.
Nutshell: your Bitcoin is stored in the Bitcoin blockchain - a public ledger.  There are many thousands of copies of that ledger, stored on computers that cooperate.  To "spend" your Bitcoin, you will need your Private Key.  If you lose that Private Key, your Bitcoin is gone.  If somebody else gets a copy of your Private Key, your Bitcoin is gone.  Forever.  There is no "customer service" undo your mistake.
As  says, buy a good wallet (place to store your Private Key), buy it directly from the manufacturer (why lose $12K because you wanted to save $10?).  The wallet gives you a place to store your Private Key.  The wallet gives you a 24 word "seed" in case your wallet gets stolen, lost, destroyed - you can buy another wallet and enter the exact same 24 words in the exact same order, and be good again.  
Therefore, I would store at least two copies of the 24 words, securely, in separate locations (in case of fire, flood, etc.)  Remember: if you loose the 24 word seed, your Bitcoin is gone.  If somebody else finds your 24 words, they're likely to steal your Bitcoin, and there is no way to get it back.
Of course, once you have your wallet, be sure to send your Bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet.

Bitcoin does the job of gold, but does it so much better.  
Gold is expensive to store securely (in significant amounts).  
Gold is very expensive to transport securely.  
As mentioned, purchased gold must be assayed (tested for purity).  
Gold is heavy and takes up space.  
Gold sets off metal detectors.  
Gold can be taken by force.  
In addition to all that, lately there is much 'rehypothecation' of gold -- that is, there is many times more "paper gold" (ETFs) that actual physical gold to back it.  The bankers are up to their old tricks again!  
Bitcoin costs very little to store securely, costs very little to transport securely, does not have to be assayed, does not take up space.  Bitcoin weighs nothing and sets of no detectors.  Bitcoin cannot be taken by force.  
As fiat money continues to die, more and more people will be waking up to the fact that Bitcoin is better than gold.  Bitcoin will become the de facto Global Reserve Currency.  
Keep holding; be patient.

Once upon a time, I was at a "big store" and the check-out clerk told me that if I applied for their store's credit card, I could save 10% (or something like that).  I thought, I have big purchase coming up... I'll apply then, and save 10% on that purchase.  Weeks later I made that purchase, applied for their stupid credit card, and was denied.  WTF?  Investigating revealed that the store already issued a credit card to somebody with the same Social Security number, but a different name...  Fortunately, for me, that other person also has good credit.

What stops you is that the **second** block contains a **hash** of the **first block.**  Similarly, the third block contains a hash of the second \[edit\].  Thus each block will require it's own nonce to satisfy the requirements, and finding that nonce requires  **work and time to do the work**.
Since you have significantly less hashing power than the legitimate network, you'll never catch up.  If you did scrape together enough hardware, then you're still better off, financially, to play by the rules and just mine legitimate blocks.

You could send Bitcoin to a friend's wallet, from your own wallet, for example, either as a gift or in exchange for something (work, fiat money, a bicycle, etc.).
If you happened to have a friend with Bitcoin who is willing to trade you some, it could go that way, too.

I've found that few people actually understand logic.
People use gold for jewelry because it's valuable.  
Gold is not valuable because people make rings out of it.  
Gold is valuable because it has all seven of these special properties:
 *  Durable  
 *  Portable  
 *  Divisible  
 *  Recognizable  
 *  Fungible  
 *  Scarce  
 *  Difficult/expensive to counterfeit/produce  
Bitcoin also has those properties - all of them.  
Without scarcity, the price of gold we be about the same as the price of aluminum or copper.

To me, Bitcoin isn't about people buying a cup of coffee with their smartphone.
To me, Bitcoin isn't some magic thing you put fiat into so you can extract even more fiat from it, later.
Look at certain central banks and certain countries around the world: they provide us with fiat currencies, while they work furiously to hoard gold - hundreds of tons of gold.
Let that sink in.
of tons
of gold.
Obviously, they know better than to trust each other. They know better than to trust in fiat.
For a while, they kind of "had to" trust in the USD, but those days are coming to an end.
There are serious issues with gold; still, it's a lot better than any fiat currency.
Along comes Bitcoin...
Bitcoin can do what gold does, and Bitcoin can do it better.
To me, Bitcoin is about a de facto Global Reserve Currency.
Forget your little coffee shop -- think about fleets of oil tankers moving about the globe. Think about natural gas pipelines. Think about global trade. Fuel. Minerals. Food. Lumber.... commodities...

Typically, at the point where you exchange fiat for Bitcoin, or Bitcoin for fiat, the government is going to find out.   
On the other hand, imagine you bought some amount of Bitcoin on an exchange, then immediately sent it to a Bitcoin address which has never been used before.  Nobody can prove or disprove who, if anyone, has the private key for that receiving address.  For example, the person who used the exchange could say something like, "I traded them for foot rubs from a homeless guy.  I don't know his name; he had no address.  He has them now."  Who could prove otherwise?  
Going the other way, when a person suddenly transfers Bitcoin to an exchange, then trades them for fiat, some governments are going to try to tax that transaction.  What are you going to do about it?  Well, if you were going to use the fiat to buy a used bicycle, you might consider just trading Bitcoin for the bicycle.  
Some of us know, we just need to hold, and wait for the current "fiat money system" to finish imploding and disintegrating...

Suppose you have one pound of clay.  You divide it into two pieces.  You still have one pound of clay - not two, just one.  You divide each of the two pieces into smaller pieces.  You still have one pound of clay, not two, not four.
You have $20.  You exchange it at a bank or store for 2000 pennies.  You still have $20.
You can divide 21 million Bitcoins into 100 million pieces, each, but you still only have 21 million Bitcoin.  Dividing Bitcoin into smaller fractions of Bitcoin does not create any new Bitcoin.

Get out of debt, then stay out of debt.  
Save an emergency cash cushion enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).  
In addition to that, save up for your old age (don't count on government programs).  Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets.  Make sure one of those baskets is Bitcoin.  
Don't bother with "alt-coins".  
Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.  
Don't invest money you might need for something else w/in the next 2 or 3 years.  
Buy some Bitcoin, learn how to buy, then transfer to and from your own wallet.  **Learn** **what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works**.  Learn about "money" (eg, read "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous and/or watch: [ )  
Remember: **not your keys, not your Bitcoin**.  Don't store your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange/web site/etc. any longer than necessary.  
Once you've learned the basics of how to, then consider investing more and more.  
Beware of scams/scammers.  This includes people touting their "TA" (technical analysis).  TA is bullshit - sadly, even smart people can fall for it.  Don't "loan" your Bitcoin to anyone.  Fools and their money are soon parted.  Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.  
Buy, then hold, long term.  **Be patient.**  Don't panic.  Eventually, you'll get used to wild price movements.  Don't bother trying to time the market.  Be wise.  
Protect your private key(s) -- and keep a back up of the key(s) and/or "seed words" in a secure off-site location.

Instead of spending their time using their own system to make huge wads of money, and/or spending their time enjoying some of that wealth (out yachting, golfing, flying their private jet...), they're spending hours and hours on their "newsletters" and "youtube videos" and drawing their silly little "charts".
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:38:00
That's a good answer.
Yes.  Install a wallet on your computer.  Buy at Coinbase (or some exchange), then send your Bitcoin to your own wallet for long term storage.  That's wise.  
Later, if you want to sell some, transfer it from your wallet to your exchange account (the exchange web site will give you the address to send it TO, which you will copy and paste very carefully  into your wallet's "send" screen..)  Then you sell.  Then you need to transfer the fiat to your linked bank account, etc.  Remember, this step could take a few days (in some cases, even longer).  
There should be threads here about which wallets are "best" etc.  There are a lot of very helpful people here who can answer questions along the way.

Yes.  That's a good point.  Still, there is more reason to have faith in a kind of money that must be mined from deep in the earth, then refined, vs, for example, fiat currency created at will by merely typing numbers into a bank's computer.  
Meanwhile, the term "backed by," comes from gold-backed notes.  People would deposit physical gold in a "bank" and be given a note, backed by the physical gold in that bank.  Anybody with that note could later go to that bank, present the note, and get an equivalent amount of gold back.  Thus, to say that money is "backed by" faith is stupid because faith is not tangible.  You can't take US Dollars into a US bank and exchange them for a bucket or box full of "faith".

I don't think of Bitcoin only in terms of what it's currently worth in some fiat currency.

When people with WEALTH see that the money around them is becoming worthless, they will turn to something better.  They're not going to sell their Bitcoin (if they have any) to get more fiat, unless they're a fool.  No doubt, some are fools, but not all.

The price of BTC is determined by supply and demand.  Supply comes from sellers.  Demand from buyers.

A lot of it will be due to the demand for Bitcoin outgrowing the supply over time.  
Right now, you could buy a decent car for 3 BTC.  Someday, you'll be able to buy a nice mansion for 3 BTC... one with a circular driveway for your dinner party guests to park in, and a hired bartender...

What problem(s) does Bitcoin solve?  In other words, why bother to have/own/understand this new thing called Bitcoin?
To me, Bitcoin is **not** about using a smartphone to buy a cup of coffee, or to buy underwear on-line.  People can already do that just fine.
I see Bitcoin as the next **Global Reserve Currency**.  Most people don't even know that there is such a thing -- you can teach them how **Bitcoin does the job of gold, but does it even better than gold**.  Think big, think really big - international settlement for things like oil, grains, ore, finished goods... getting around US Dollar hegemony (another thing most people have never heard of), getting around bullshit sanctions...  For the little guys, like us, Bitcoin is a nice place to store wealth, long term, for retirement - storing it where no dickhead banker nor politician can get their evil hands on it.
Fiat currencies are in big trouble right now.  Most people are ignorant about it - their TV keeps telling them that all is well.  All is **not** well.  For example, there is thirteen or fourteen trillion dollars worth of **negative interest rate bonds** in the world.  Hello?  There is nothing "well" about negative interest rates - the fact that they exist right now should sound an alarm.  Compare the global debt to GDP - again, hello?  Sound the alarm.  YES, this boring "economics" shit DOES affect you in ways most have not imagined.
Bitcoin is part of the solution.  If you don't know what kind of trouble lies ahead, you'll probably never grasp the true beauty and brilliance of Bitcoin.

How Central Banking "fiat money" works under that hood:
Central banker types a number into a computer, clicks "save".  Trillions of US Dollars worth or central bank "play money" is created and can now be used to further enrich and empower the banker and/or his cronies, at the expense of many others.  Bankers and their cronies know better than to trust their own "play money" so they use it to buy (steal) actual wealth (valuable assets).

The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 37 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

The **price** of Bitcoin is determined by **supply** and **demand.**  
**Supply** comes from people **selling** Bitcoin.  
**Demand** comes from people wishing to **buy** Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin's price drives mining activity, not the other way around.  
If the price of Bitcoin goes up, then there is more incentive to mine.  Price down, less incentive.  
More mining, the difficulty adjusts.  Less mining, the difficulty adjusts -- automatically.  
When the price falls, some miners find it impossible to earn profit, and they'll typically stop mining.  When the price rises, more people figure they can mine and earn a profit, and so they do.
Mining does not drive price.  Price drives mining.

Who needs even more?  If 100% ROI isn't good enough, then 105% ROI isn't going to be good enough, either.  Why expose yourself to risk and worry for a tiny bit extra?  Because you're a fool -- that's the only real answer.  Fools and their money are soon parted.

Wrong.  
Fiat currency is legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it. No government issues Bitcoin.  
The U.S. dollar is fiat money, as are the euro and many other major world currencies. This approach differs from money whose value is underpinned by some physical good such as gold or silver, called commodity money.  
Bitcoin is not commodity money.  Bitcoin is not fiat money.  
Gold is not commodity money.  Gold is not fiat money.

"Either you get some Bitcoin soon, or you'll be poor and suffer for it the rest of your life."  That's something every person should care about -- their own sorry ass.  
Thing is, that will fail too, because most people have bought into the "debt is wealth" bullshit, and as a result, they have no wealth to protect, they have no money.  They have debt.  You tell them to buy Bitcoin, you'll just piss them off because they can't buy Bitcoin w/ their credit cards.  
In fact, the best thing might be to tell them, "I lost mine, I need to hurry up and get more..." so they don't try to rob you in the not-too-distant future, or if they do, you can say, "Remember?  I told you I lost mine."  It's going to be bad; people will be desperate.  Don't think that being friends or relatives will protect you from them when the shit hits the fan.

**The price of Bitcoin influences the cost to mine one Bitcoin.  The cost of mining does not influence the price of Bitcoin.**  
Here's how it goes:  
The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand.  
Supply comes from sellers.  
Demand comes from buyers.  
If the price of Bitcoin goes up, more people will figure they can mine for a profit, but then the difficulty increases, and the cost to mine one Bitcoin (on average) goes up.  
If the price of Bitcoin goes down significantly, fewer people figure it's worth the cost to mine, the mining difficulty goes down, and the cost to mine, on average, goes down.

Fiat money always dies.  History provides a large number of examples.
Yes, there are fiat currencies now, which are not dead -- not **yet**.  An honest examination, however, shows that even today's fiat currencies are about to die.  Not convinced?  Try explaining **negative interest rates**.
Bitcoin is not a fiat currency.  Bitcoin is a "hard" money, like gold but even better.
Thus, as countries around the world have been and continue to strive to get themselves out from under US Dollar hegemoney, Bitcoin surfaces as the ideal and obvious replacement to become the next **de facto Global Reserve Currency**.
With a future like that, the question isn't, "Why has the price of Bitcoin gone up so fast?" rather, an even better question is, "**What's taking so long?  Why hasn't it reached $100K per BTC yet?**"

You'll need to find an adult to help you - one you can trust with some of your money.
You have money, right?  Good.
That adult can be a parent, older sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, older cousin, friend, friend's parent or friend's older sibling, a teacher/coach, a boss (if you have one) or somebody you've worked for in the past.
Explain to them what Bitcoin is, so they know you're not getting scammed (that's good if they're concerned about you getting scammed).  Be prepared to share a video or legitimate web page explaining the very basics of Bitcoin.  If you do a really good job of explaining it to them, that person might end up wanting to buy some for himself/herself - and will come back to thank you someday.
There is no need to "trade" Bitcoin, trying to guess whether it's about to go up or down is a fools game, fraught with unnecessary risks and exchange fees (and could complicate your taxes).
Buy and hold!  People who have been holding a long time are very, very happy about it.  I want you to be very, very happy someday, too.

You'll need your own wallet, running on your computer/phone.  Get a Bitcoin wallet, one that will allow you to **sweep** your private key (without using a QR code).
If you're looking to sell your Bitcoin, you'll need an account at an **exchange** (such as coinbase).  Establishing an account can take a while (days, weeks...) so get started soon.  Once you have a wallet, and have swept your private key into it, and your exchange account is ready, **send** your Bitcoin from your wallet to the exchange and then initiate a sell.  Eventually, transfer your fiat money from the exchange to your bank/checking account...
Or, see if your friend would like to buy the Bitcoin back from you... save steps.

Banks/ATMS becoming unavailable along with payment cards being declined.  Interesting.  
It could just be a "computer glitch" this time.  
Someday, in the not-too-distant future, it will be due to a credit/liquidity crisis, and will affect many banks.  **When this happens, will you be prepared?**  
Yes, Bitcoin is nice, in the long run, but in the short run you'll likely need things like:
* gasoline / transportation fare
* food / groceries
* prescription medications
* toilet paper, etc.
Gee.  It sure would be nice to have some cash on hand, when that happens.  It wouldn't hurt to keep your gas tank full and your pantry/fridge stocked.  Keep some extra TP on hand.  
If the crisis goes long enough, you might wish you had:
* More cash
* A bicycle
* Bags of rice, etc.
* Bottled water
* A camp stove
* Candles and flashlights
* A generator
If things get really, really bad:
* Bitcoin
* Gold, silver coins
* Guns, ammo
* Street smarts
* Good neighbors
* A boat

Good thing Bitcoin only uses a **very tiny portion of all energy** used by humans.  
**Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons**
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

Bitcoin Core is **way** safer than storing your BTC at an on-line exchange.  It's (probably) safer than any smart-phone wallet.
For long-term storage, near-maximum security consider a hardware wallet, like Coldcard.  Hardware wallet costs money.  Bitcoin Core is free.
Apparently, an ultra-secure method is to use "multi-signature" with two different wallets, at least one of them "air gapped".  That costs even more and is more complicated.

**Summary: Bitcoin could/might tank along with everything else, but it will eventually "go to the moon".**  
I gave this some thought.  My conclusion, so far, is that the next economic downturn will be global and will be the biggest ever seen in all of history.  
Because of the massive amount of debts (government, corporate, private), and the fact that those debts are primarily denominated in fiat currencies, there will be massive, massive amounts of debt defaults -- basically, the system will topple like a house of cards.  This should usher in a brief period of high deflation.  The banking system and other financial systems will lock up.  Liquidity will be nil.  Compared to today, there will be no more credit, no lending, no borrowing.  Kiss your credit cards good bye.  Forget about getting a car loan, or business loan, or a mortgage.  
Prices are likely to collapse, especially for things like: Real estate, bonds, stocks, automobiles, furniture, "collectibles".  The price of Bitcoin, measured in fiat money may tank - temporarily.  Still, I would not bet on that happening, because even if Bitcoin's price tanks, you may not be able to buy it -- remember, the banking system is toast, and politicians like to step in during hard times and impose bullshit price controls and such.  The Bitcoin exchange may not be able to get the money from your bank, because that bank is likely to be closed, if not temporarily, then permanently.  If this temporary deflationary death spiral happens, it might turn out to be a good time to already own Bitcoin, then use it to buy that home you've always wanted.  But this would be the first phase, if it happens.  
The central banks (Federal Reserve) and governments will use the opportunity to "step in" and do stupid things under the guise of helping us, but really they'll be trying to save their own butts.  As mentioned above, price and wage controls (which have been shown to fail, again, and again)... **Excessive money "printing"** because, that's all they've got -- their only power is from, has been from, and will ever come from them having the sole ability to create as much fiat currency as they want, from nothing, backed by nothing but nonsense, then using it to bail out, enrich, and empower themselves and their closest cronies.  It should be no surprise to anybody when they create hundreds or even thousands of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat currencies -- just like Zimbabwe, Wiemar Germany, Venezuela, etc., but on a much, much larger and global scale.  THIS will be the day for Bitcoin to really shine, shine, shine...  Get ready for the moon.

When a country's currency fails, there is typically hyperinflation.  Many innocent people suffer.  There are often shortages of food, fuel, etc.  There may be social unrest.  People who had saved for retirement get "robbed" by hyperinflation, unless they see it coming and are able to store wealth in, say, gold, Bitcoin, real estate, etc.  When a country's currency fails, people are generally resourceful and will do things like switch to another country's currency, or use a commodity (tobacco, etc.)... often black markets sprout up and those "in charge" impose price/wage controls (which always fail).
Anarchy ("no government") has always been a transition from one government to the next.  These days, rather than being invaded, a puppet government (regime) might be "installed" by, say, a corrupt superpower.  
China.  
China could end up being a bag holder.  Most Americans will also end up being bag holders.  As far as I know, the US has not pledged itself, its land as collateral for the treasury bonds.  Even if it did, are you going to just fork over your "stuff" (property, wealth, labor, etc.) to the Chinese government?  Remember, there are a lot of private citizens who own firearms, for example.  Big countries can't invade these days because it might start a nuclear war -- so they use money as a weapon (sanctions, currency manipulation, trade wars, etc).

First: Bitcoin trades 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.  There is no "daily close".   
Second "TA" is bullshit.  You can't predict the future by drawing lines on a price chart.
Third: as fiat currencies continue to be debased by their respective central banks, demand for Bitcoin, over time, on average should continue to grow as supply will shrink.  No guarantee.  Buy and hold, so far, has been a very excellent strategy, those with patience (**as you rightly encourage**) have done extremely well, and I see no reason for the long-term trend to end.

The "best" is that you buy some Bitcoin from a friend.
Most people use an exchange: create an account, link it to a bank account, buy Bitcoins and the exchange pulls fiat currency from your bank account.
At this point, you still don't technically own the Bitcoins.  To take full ownership, you'll need a wallet where you control the private keys.  You'll send the Bitcoins you purchased from the exchange to an address you get from your wallet -- then they are safely yours.

Negative interest rates.  
Stop and think about it for a few seconds, at least.  
"*Loan me $100, I'll repay you $93 next week*."  I don't think so.  
Pay the bank to keep your money there?  Why do that when you can just keep your money elsewhere?  \[Therefore, beware of 'cashless' society.\]  
People getting **paid** to borrow?  Does this not have a bad odor to you?  
**What's going on here?**  
Negative interest rates are a **symptom** of some very serious problems.  
Let's look at  what happened the last time humanity saw negative interest rates.  
We can't.  
It has never happened before.  
So, why now?  Is it because today's bankers are so smart that they're the first to "discover" this great, new, wonderful thing called "negative interest rates"?  Or is it because they've reached the end of their "phony money" system, and like every other fiat money before (of which there are many historical examples), their fiat system is now 100% doomed?

Yes.  
Suppose you have, say, $50,000 in a savings account.  At what point do you pull your cash from the bank and store it yourself? 
Remember: if the cops pull you over and find that much cash, they'll arrest you and take the cash (some of it goes into their retirement account).  Also, if you take $50K into a bank to deposit it, you're going to set off all kinds of "alerts" and suspicion.  Also, say you want to buy a new car and pay for it with cash, and you're at the car dealer and you pull out $30K cash, they're required to "report" you.
Or, are we supposed to say, "Oh, to hell with saving for retirement or a financial emergency...," then spend it all on stupid shit like Fried Chicken Candy in a Tin, or toilet paper with faces of politicians printed on it... or a plastic replica of 5 lb. Human Body Fat ??

There is no good reason to trade.

At least the cats don't talk.  And nobody sits around in front of the cameras talking about what the cats did, they just go straight to the next cat video...

Okay.  Fair enough.
Ideally, you'd have a friend/relative who just happens to own tons of Bitcoin and is willing to sell some to you.
Otherwise, what you're doing is probably considered worse than dealing drugs.  You have to go find strangers who have Bitcoin and are willing to  sell to you for cash.  My advice, meet in public.  Consider, do you want security cameras around, or not?  Further advice, don't do a huge deal with someone you don't know.  Do several smaller deals, in case one of them goes wrong.  Consider that you could be dealing with law enforcement...
Other than that, investigate travel to another country where you might buy Bitcoin for "cash".  But then, make sure you have the right kind of cash they're looking for.  
It's like this: the government turns a blind eye when the Too Big To Fail criminal banks commit all manner of crimes, including but not limited to Money Laundering (and Fraud, helping terrorists, etc.)  But if a little guy like you gets caught - dammit! - they HATE competition, and you may not see the outside of a prison for a long, long time.

Frequent trading is for fools.  Day trading is for idiots.
There is no need to take unnecessary risks; no need to pay all those exchange fees; no need to \[possibly\] complicate your tax situation.
All you need to do is buy Bitcoin, move the Bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet, then wait and be patient.  So far, long term, on average Bitcoin has more than doubled in price per year.  If 100% or more ROI is not enough for you, see a doctor, get a brain scan, there is something the matter with you and you should have a medical professional evaluate you.

Frequent trading is foolish.
Every trade entails **risk**.  The risks accumulate with every trade, working against the trader.  
Every trade entails **cost** (fees).  The costs accumulate, and when combined with the risks, the trader has very little chance of long term success.   
Depending upon where you live, frequent trading can greatly complicate your tax filing.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin's long-term average ROI is more than 100 percent per year -- without unnecessary risks or fees.  If that's not good enough for you, you're fucked up.
Furthermore, "TA" is bullshit, fake, make-believe.  Why delude yourself?

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

Where did the Universe come from?  All the stuff?
The matter, energy, forces, space, time, and the immutable laws of nature governing the interactions between all of them...
I don't have enough faith to believe that the Universe created itself.  But if it did, if "dirt created dirt," then that makes dirt the creator.  Either way, there is a creator.  (In the case where the "stuff/dirt" is the creator, we call that Pantheism.)
Most (if not all) of the atheists I've met were angry at God, and usually with one or more good reason.  For example, I knew a person, one of their parents died, tragically.
I've known some agnostics - very intellectually honest.  They say, "I don't know.  I'm not sure that you know, either."  Fair enough.
In my case, I was told over and over that there is no God.  But I learned to question "authority" and I looked around... and reached some conclusions.

Next to last line, the price was about $350.

I see Bitcoin becoming the next de facto Global Reserve Currency.  
If you want to see the value of Bitcoin skyrocket, then you'll want to see it used for settlement of large international trades (as opposed to cups of coffee, cab fare, slices of pizza).  Think FOREX.  Think oil, ore, grain.  Think, "the new, improved gold".  Most of all, think BIG.
Bankers know better than to trust each other (especially central bankers), along with big businesses, governments, etc.  That's why they've been furiously stockpiling thousands of tons of gold.  
Yes.  
Thousands of tons of gold.  They know better than to trust fiat money.  
Along comes Bitcoin - it performs the job of gold, but does it better.  It allows an escape route from US Dollar hegemony.  It allows countries, corporations, and individuals to get around "sanctions" imposed by so-called leaders.  It allows great amounts of wealth to be stored and/or transferred securely, quickly, easily, and inexpensively.  
Look at a cup of coffee, $2.75.  Now imaging that cup is a fleet of supertankers, and that coffee is crude oil - THERE is the future of Bitcoin.  Think big, really, really big.
Imagine a central bank vault: the real estate costs, construction costs, the never-ending security costs... need to transfer a few hundred tons of gold?  Imagine the costs for securely transporting it across the ocean.  Imagine how long that would take.  Now imagine little hardware wallet replacing the vault.  Then imagine sending billions of dollars worth of money across the Internet, securely, for just a few dollars.  And, typically within an hour having 6 confirmations.  Think really, really Big.

Find a balance that you're comfortable with.  Save some, invest some, spend some to have a good time.

One Hundred Million Dollars.  
To answer your second question: At some point we reach "permanent backwardation," where no sane person would trade a Bitcoin for ANY amount of USD.  At that point, the price of Bitcoin in USD approaches infinity, which is well above one hundred million.  This will be mostly due to the utter lack of value of the USD at that point.  
Another question might be, "Will one Bitcoin ever buy as much 'stuff' as $100,000,000 USD would buy in 2019?"  Eventually, yes.  In our lifetime?  I don't know.

Right now, we have fractional reserve lending -- for every $100 deposited into a bank, $665 or $1000 gets created from thin air.
With Bitcoin, fractional reserve lending is not possible.  The entire lending industry will be turned on its head.  First, banks won't be able to create Bitcoin by lending it out.  This will kill housing bubbles, for example.  Yay.  Second, when a bank makes bad loans, the central bank cannot create Bitcoins from thin air to bail them out.  Yay.

Don't worry about it.  
The US Dollar is doomed; the global reserve currency is doomed.  
The USD will take the other fiat currencies to zero with it.  
Some are already turning to gold (and/or silver).  Some have been turning to Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin has certain, significant advantages over gold.  
Meanwhile, those with limited understanding merely see Bitcoin as a way to "make money".  
Bitcoin **is** money.  I believe that Bitcoin will become the next global reserve currency.  
Compared to where it's going, who really gives a fuck about next week's or next month's price and whether the next halving event has been baked into the price yet??

In the meanwhile, if you haven't already, learn what Bitcoin actually is and the basics of how it works.  I also highly suggest learning about the serious flaws inherent in the current global fiat-money system.  For example:

Nope.  There is a finite amount of Bitcoin.  In a fractional reserve banking system, fiat money is created when loans are made, but this does not apply to Bitcoin.  The supply of Bitcoin is strictly limited and 21 million BTC is the limit.  Period.

Dear Beginners:
**Do not trade your Bitcoin.  Buy and hold; be patient.**  
The truth is: day traders end up **broke**.  Why?  Each trade entails **risk** and **fees.  Eventually, you end up losing your investment.  You cannot "time" the market.  TA is bullshit.**
Consider this, an investment that returns a 6 percent ROI (return on investment, per year) is considered a really, really good investment at this point in history.  Bitcoin's long-term ROI has been averaging more than 100%.  One hundred percent per year.  It beats the pants off of everything out there: stocks, bonds, hedge funds, start ups, gold, real estate...
If 100% ROI isn't enough for you, you have some serious mental issues.   If 100% ROI doesn't make you happy, then 105% ROI won't make you happy either, but the fact is, you'll end up with little or no money and little or no Bitcoin if you fall for the day trading bullshit.
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:15:56
You're missing the point, which is this:  
In the **fiat currency** banking system, we have a relatively small number of individuals with the sole power to **create all the 'money' they want**, from thin air, backed by nothing - they don't even need to bother printing bills; they merely type numbers into the bank's computer.
Since about 2008, they have created many **tens of trillions of dollars worth of central bank 'play money'**, and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  
So, you end up with a few ultra-rich people, most of whom got there and stay there by using the central banks to effectively "cheat", and you have the rest of us who are being cheated and growing poorer (as a group).
**Bitcoin is a solution**, not part of the problem.
Bitcoin cannot be created by merely typing a few numbers into a computer.  The Bitcoin ledger cannot be altered to "rob" poor people.  The Bitcoin network/protocol cannot be used as a "weapon" to censor/sanction countries or individuals.

It will **not** be a ***recession***, that is, a periodic "business cycle" where inventories grew a little faster than consumption.

Ah.  Something like "Bitcoin backed notes."
The thing about "gold backed notes" -- Let's go back in time.  There is no "national currency".  Gold is money.  You've done well, and now you have your "pile" of gold.  How do you protect it?  You want to be able to leave home without worrying that thieves will physically take your gold while you're gone (to work in the field, to visit somebody, etc.)  
You could build a big vault.  Vaults are expensive.  You could hire guards, too.  They're expensive, too.  
But wait.  There's a dude who already has a really nice vault with 24/7 security: the local goldsmith.  You can park your gold there, and he'll give  you notes so you can redeem portions gold later, if you need/want to.  You can trade those notes, similar to using the gold itself.  Hey, everybody is doing it.  Also, it's easier to hide and carry a few notes instead of many pounds of gold if you're heading out to do a business deal, say, buy some horses or cattle.  
Gold is expensive to store securely.  Gold is very expensive to securely transport, especially over long distances.  
Okay.  Back to the present time.  
Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.  Bitcoin is relatively easy and inexpensive to transport, or send -- even large amounts over long distances.  Bitcoin is relatively fast compared to securely transporting pounds or tons of gold from one country/region to another.  
In short: Bitcoin doesn't have the security problems gold had (and still has).  It's easier and safer to use Bitcoin itself rather than "Bitcoin backed notes".  
Will those knuckleheads try to fool people with "Bitcoin backed notes"?  Probably.  I would not be surprised.  Will some people fall for it?  Oh, yeah, the same people who send money to the Nigerian astronaut who needs money so he can return from orbit...  Will I ever use a Bitcoin backed note?  If so, only for the time it takes to redeem it for actual Bitcoin in my own wallet.

Currently, most (if not all) government-issued money happens to be "fiat currency".
The problem is FIAT CURRENCY, and its inherent flaws, not the fact that "money" happens to be issued by a government.
Bitcoin is not "fiat" - quite the opposite.  Bitcoin is HARD MONEY (the hardest ever).  If a government dared to issue hard money, that would be great for the people, but bad for the crooked central bankers and their cronies.

Two men are fleeing their country, where the government has collapsed and there is much pandemonium, even more than usual.  One man is carrying two pounds of gold.   The other man has his private key memorized (or 24 seed words memorized).  Along the road, they are stopped by 'bandits' - former police officers.  
The bandits beat, strip, and search the men.  The Bitcoin guy they take his blanket, then let him go.  As the bandits start to search the other man's belongings he resists - they shoot him and take his gold.  
Notice: the Bitcoin could not be detected.

...and then one day, Bitcoin has become THE global reserve currency.  
Why?  
Because everybody else has been working furiously for more than 10 years to ditch US Dollar hegemony.  Because the US and its allies have been using USD as a financial weapon, causing great harm and unnecessary suffering to countless innocent victims around the globe.  
Because switching to a different fiat currency would merely kick the can down the road, but not very far.  
Because fiat currencies always get "printed" down to zero.  
Because gold is expensive to store securely , extremely expensive to transport securely, and it is a very, very slow form of money for international trade settlements.  
Because Bitcoin is the hardest form of money ever invented.  Bitcoin is inexpensive to store securely, and cannot be confiscated by brute force violence.  Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, even on a global scale, and those transactions are relatively "instant".
Still, people, on a mass scale, might resort to using gold again, for settlement of international trades.  Some people are going to figure out that Bitcoin is even better.  It's just a matter of time.

At first, I saw it as the perfect money for refugees, or for people living through SHTF tough-times.

They're called "shitcoins".  Why?  
Some are pure scams.

Others don't use Proof of Work and want you to believe that their technology is secure when it really has serious flaws.  
Others have had to "rewrite history" to "fix" their blockchain after somebody stole a lot of "money" -- they lack immutability, and that's bad.

To understand Bitcoin, you need to understand money.  
Most people think they understand money, because they use it just about every day.  "What's there to understand?"  
Most people don't understand money.  
Read, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous -- learn about money, some of the history of money, the different forms of money... and learn all about Bitcoin, too.  He also has an entire section about "alt coins" (they're called shit coins for good reasons).

**Nutshell**: your wallet 'signs' then broadcasts the transaction.  The seller is the one who will be interested in seeing "confirmations".
I'll assume you know what an accounting **ledger** is - a list of **transactions** where each transaction is a specified amount money being sent from one account to another at a certain time.  In this case the "money" being sent is Bitcoin, and the accounting ledger is stored on many thousands of computers spread around the globe.  
When you buy something w/ Bitcoin, you're going to create one of those **transactions** where a certain amount of Bitcoin (BTC) is sent from your account (or 'address') to the seller's address/account.  That transaction gets broadcast to anyone who cares to "listen in on" the Bitcoin ledger.  For security and to prevent "double spending" your transaction needs to be "mined" into a "block" on the ledger...  Think of a block as like an entire "page" of a ledger which gets "stamped" and verified and made public in a way that nobody can go back and change it later.

Right.  Don't leave your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange.  Send those coins to a NEW address, one for which YOU control the Private Key.  If anybody asks, say, "Nope.  That's not my address.  I donated those coins to a Druid so he can sacrifice some grasshoppers on my behalf during a full moon.  That's HIS address.

If you don't mind, I'll use a hypothetical example to illustrate.
In 1965, Jimmy's grandparents passed away.  Jimmy was just a baby at the time.  His grandparents left their entire life savings to their infant grandson: $25,000 (approx.) -- enough to pay cash for two houses near San Jose, or eleven brand new Ford Mustangs.  Candy bars were five cents.  Jimmy had enough money to buy 500,000 (half million) candy bars at retail prices.
Jimmy's parents disagreed about what to do with Jimmy's inheritance.  His dad said, "Just lock in our safe," but his mother insisted they buy gold with it.  Since they couldn't agree, they used half of the money to buy gold and parked the gold and the remaining $12,500 in the safe.
The years went on.  Jimmy grew up, his parents grew old and they just recently died.  Jimmy opened their safe and found a box with his name on it.  Inside the box: $12,500 in cash and 350 one-ounce gold coins.
The cash will now buy about one half of a new Ford Mustang, or the same cash will only pay for about 3 percent of a cheap condo costing $400K.   Snickers bars now cost  a buck, the cash can only buy 25,000.
The gold will still buy about 11 new Ford Mustangs and about a half million snickers bars, or, a $470K home.

Something will replace the US Dollar -- especially in the role of "global reserve currency".  There's a long, multi-generation cycle, repeated throughout history; in the past after fiat money failed they went back to gold, but this time we have gold and we have Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin has certain advantages over gold.  Gold is expensive to store securely, but not Bitcoin.  Gold is very expensive and slow to transport securely, especially in large amounts; Bitcoin is relatively inexpensive to transport securely, is relativley instant, and does not have to be assayed at the receiving end.

To "print" fiat money, on the other hand, only requires some banker to type numbers into the bank's computer.  It costs, essentially nothing to "print" trillions of US Dollars, for example.

No.  If you learn what a Ponzi scheme actually is, then learn what Bitcoin actually is, you quickly see several important differences.
Bitcoin is not a  Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:
* there is an  "operator" -- a central authority (one    person, or a small group), a  swindler.
* The swindler receives money from people
* The  swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some     business venture with an  expected high rate of return.  That money is     NOT invested.  There is  no money-making business venture.  Any  returns    are paid from the  swindled money.
* The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a  big,   fat lie.
* The  Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new  suckers   arrive to put  their money into it.
* A Ponzi scheme cannot  survive a   "crash".
* A  Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.
Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin      is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an      immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.

@_date: 2019-06-05 14:57:23
TA is bullshit.
Just buy, then hold long-term, like 10 years.  These daily price fluctuations are just noise.  Learn to look that the big, long-term picture -- and not just Bitcoin.  Learn about "money," in general.  Learn about what's been happening with the central banks around the world.  Learn some history, for example, Nixon taking the US off the gold standard, the creation of the Federal Reserve, the crash of 1929, the Great Depression, the dot com bubble, the housing bubble, 2008/9... TARP, QE, ZIRP... see the next one coming.  Compared to that, these daily price changes are mere noise.

2nd time scale because Bitcoin is relatively new.  I had to pick **some** start point.  I picked that one, for the reason I just gave (can't go back 20 years, going back 10 years could be considered a cheap shot...)

A miner collects information for a block, that is, a collection of unconfirmed transactions.  
The miner includes a number of his choosing to the other information, then computes a hash value of the transactions and chosen number.  If that hash value is less than the current difficulty setting, the miner "wins" and his block joins the chain.
(A bit simplified, but close enough.)
Typically, the chosen number leads to a hash value that is greater than the difficulty setting, and the miner chooses a different number and tries again (re-computes the has value).  Thus, miners guess-and-check, guess-and-check as fast as they can...
More miners and/or faster mining equipment will tend to "solve" blocks (as described above) with greater frequency.  Fewer miners and/or less hash-computation power will tend to decrease the frequency.  The Bitcoin network wants blocks to be solved every ten minutes on average.  When blocks are being solved, on average, in less than ten minutes, the network adjusts the difficulty setting (a number), making it smaller, which makes it less likely for any one "guess" to "win", which has the effect of making blocks take longer to solve, on average.

Hey there.  I'm trying to be nice and trying to be helpful.  Please let me give you some constructive criticism.
Before you write something: **know your target audience**.  Also, think about what it is that you want to say, what you want to communicate to them.  Know your target audience: what do they already know or don't know...  
Let's start with your first paragraph:  


Somebody who doesn't know what Bitcoin is.  That's your **target audience**.  They won't know what "cryptocurrency" is.  They'll have no idea about centralized/decentralized or why that matters.  Most people have no clue about what a central bank is, or what it does, how it works, how it ultimately fails.   Users, peers, intermediaries... Face it: at this point you have lost your target audience, and they go away thinking, "This is confusing; Bitcoin is stupid."  
I suggest: start with something (or things) that your target readers are **already familiar with,** then explain, "Bitcoin is like .... except for this and that."  Keep it really simple.  Explain it to a five year old.  
"Bitcoin is money."  Ah.  Most people have a notion of "money".  Bitcoin is a new kind of money.  How is it different?  How is it the same?  Why bother with Bitcoin?  Here's where you'll bump into what is probably the biggest challenge: most people don't really understand money or its history.  It really helps to understand money, so you can understand "fiat currency" enough to see that it has problems, limitations... so that you can see, "Ah-ha!  Bitcoin is a **better** money..."  
Before you embark to explain the history of money, realize that a lot of people have already written excellent books, articles, web pages, ... have already made nice videos.  Maybe you should direct people to some of those resources.

Good question, BTW.  
For me, Japan provides "data" to strongly suggest that zero percent (or negative) interest rates and/or QE just don't work.  Central bankers are failures.  Central banking is failing before my very eyes.  Central bank fiat money is dying, as it should...  and THAT is the kind of thing I had on my mind the first time I read the Bitcoin White Paper, and the reason I have been a fan of Bitcoin since.

Gold's intrinsic value is on par with aluminum and copper.
What makes gold valuable compared to aluminum and copper is it's scarcity.
Money does not have intrinsic value BY DESIGN.  When people exchange items with intrinsic value for other items with intrinsic value we call that barter, and no money is involved.
Good money must have all seven of these properties:
* durable
* portable
* divisible
* fungible
* reconizable
* scarce/rare
* difficult to produce and/or counterfeit
Gold has all 7 of those properties, and **so does Bitcoin.  Fiat currency does not have all 7 properties and is therefore not "good money".**

In just a few years, the price of BTC went from tens of dollars to thousands of dollars.  I see no reason for this trend to Not continue for the next 5 to 10 years, if not longer.

The truth is hateful, huh?  Sucks to be you, then.
TA is bullshit.  The premise: I can predict the future by merely looking at recent prices changing over time.
For example, let's say you're doing your little TA on the price of oil, but then a huge deposit is found.  Would that discovery not affect the price?  Of course it would.  Where did your stupid little TA account for that discovery?  It did not; it could not.  Then, the next day, a war unexpectedly breaks out -- again, greatly affecting the price of oil.  Again, your bullshit TA had no way of foreseeing either of those events.
Same for Bitcoin.  Same for gold.
Only fools delude themselves that they can predict future prices by drawing silly, simple geometric figures on a price chart.

Get out of debt, then stay out of debt.
Save an emergency cash cushion: enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).
In addition to that, save up for your old age (don't count on government programs). Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets. Make sure one of those baskets is Bitcoin.
Don't bother with "alt-coins".
Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.
Don't invest money you might need for something else w/in the next 2 or 3 years.
Buy some Bitcoin, learn how to buy, then transfer to and from your own wallet.  **Learn** **what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works**. Learn about "money" (eg, read "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous and/or watch: [ )
Remember: **not your keys, not your Bitcoin**. Don't store your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange/web site/etc. any longer than necessary.
Once you've learned the basics of how to, then consider investing more and more.
Beware of scams/scammers. This includes people touting their "TA" (technical analysis). TA is bullshit - sadly, even smart people can fall for it. Don't "loan" your Bitcoin to anyone. Fools and their money are soon parted. Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.
Buy, then hold, long term. **Be patient.** Don't panic. Eventually, you'll get used to wild price movements. Don't bother trying to time the market. Be wise.  Ignore the "FUD" trolls.
Protect your private key(s) -- and keep a back up of the key(s) and/or "seed words" in a secure off-site location.  
Don't go around blabbing that you own a lot of Bitcoin - you could make yourself (or family members) targets for kidnapping and/or home invasion robberies.  
Don't listen to realtors. or people who recently bought real estate.

By then, the price of Bitcoin will be high enough that the fees will compensate the miners.  This will also make transactions expensive.

To understand and appreciate Bitcoin, you pretty much need to understand "money".


I think you'll be fascinated to learn the history of "money" (including fiat currencies, gold, silver, etc.).
One example: Gold.  Central banks around the world are hoarding thousands of tons of gold.  Think about the costs and challenges of storing and/or transporting, say, one hundred tons of gold.  Seriously, if I just hired you to securely transport one hundred tons (yes, tons) of gold half-way around the world, and to store it securely, how are you going to succeed?  You don't just take it down to the post office.
With Bitcoin?  It's as easy, quick, and inexpensive to send $4.5 Billion worth of Bitcoin as to send five bucks.  Six confirmations take about an hour.  It is secure.

You will either buy Bitcoin from an exchange, or from an individual (face to face) -- most likely from an exchange.  You will need to sign up for an account at an exchange, perhaps Coinbase, perhaps another.  You will be required to provide some "evidence" that you are whom you say you are - these requirements originate from cowardly Oligarchs who manipulate government officials.  That's just the way it is.  
No matter which exchange you pick:
* Do not leave Bitcoins or fiat cash parked there any longer than necessary.  In other words, don't use the exchange as a convenient wallet because bad things can happen and bad things have happened via exchanges in the past.
* Again, transfer your Bitcoins from the exchange to your wallet as soon as possible.   "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."
* Do not trust the exchange with more than you are willing and able to lose.  For example, if you want to buy (or sell) $10,000 worth of BTC, consider making several smaller purchases such that your exposure at any point in time is limited to, say, $200, or something like that.  I've read about people having thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin "stuck" in limbo at exchanges.
* Do beware of phishing scams.  Don't click on email links claiming to be from your chosen exchange.  Instead, have a bookmark to their main (login) page.
* Do use a long password, and if possible, two-factor-authorization
As for your wallet... do consider, say, the Cold Card "hardware" wallet, or something similar if you're going to be storing significant amounts of wealth in Bitcoin.  Do some reading, watch some videos, ask here for opinions, facts, etc.  Take security seriously.
If you decide to own some Bitcoin: Welcome to Bitcoin.

A better strategy: Learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  Learn, also, about why it was invented, that is, learn some history of money and see for yourself the inherent flaws in the current fiat money system.  Then buy a little Bitcoin at a time, but don't sell...  when you're old, you'll be happy about it.  
Or, you can try to "time the market" with you whopping $70... and end up broke like nearly all frequent traders.

This is just me and my "problem," but I get annoyed and immediately look for the Back Button for any explanation/article that begins with "Satoshi Nakamoto".
Besides that, the intro is longer than the actual overview of Bitcoin needs to be.  
For example:  **Bitcoin is a new kind of money.**
Right?  Most people know what "new" means and they have some notion of what "money" is.  Doesn't matter who invented it.  **Why** was it invented?  **Why** would the world need a new *kind* of money?  How is this *new* money different/better than the old money?  
Then, they typical say, "it's digital".  Well, guess what?  Most people who would be reading something from the Internet have already been using "digital" fiat currency, and they don't even realize it.  So, bringing that in, right off the bat says, to me, "This person is rewriting an article that was rewritten from an article that was rewritten....."
Reminds me of Y2K when every news article was rewritten from previous news articles without any real understanding of Y2K, nor computers, nor software, nor software development...

Bitcoin has risks.  For example, the price could go down and you might end up "underwater" for 3 years or more.
Paying off student debt has no risk.  The more you pay it down, the less interest you end up paying.
May I suggest you buy a small amount of Bitcoin, that you might use it to "learn" more about Bitcoin?  Consider it part of your "education": learn what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works.  Learn how to set up an account on an exchange.  How to buy a small amount.  Learn about hardware wallets.  Buy one.  Learn how to transfer your BTC from the exchange to your wallet.

Thank you for the reminder.
There was a large part of my life where I didn't know shit about "money", banking, central banking, etc.  I eventually learned a little bit about how the stock market is supposed to work.  I went to the company meetings where they had some stooge come in to scare us into putting money into a 401K (but then, I did the math...)  
I knew that there had been a Great Depression, and I even knew people who had lived through it, and they told me a little about it -- but never the root causes of things.  I'd heard that some people became very wealthy because of the Great Depression, market crash, etc.  This got my interest.  
Still, I remember staring at a dollar bill, wondering, "What makes this more valuable than some random piece of paper?  Okay, technically, it's a rag with greed and black (mostly) printed on it... it has printing to make it difficult to make copies...  What gives it any value?  What about this check somebody gave me?  Why is it valuable..."  Eventually I would figure that money is a "general purpose IOU," which works to explain many things, but not everything.  
One nagging question I had, "When a market goes down, where does all the money go?"  I had no clue.  Not yet.  
At least I knew that I didn't know shit about shit -- this gave me a tremendous advantage over people who'd "studied" Keynesian "economics"... I had a relatively clean slate from which to start, and some "worldly experience" (data) to use as a "filter" against any theories I would encounter.  
In 2004 I encountered a housing bubble.  Somebody recommended a book about economic bubbles, starting with the Tulip Mania.  Then, somebody recommended, "The Creature from Jekyll Island."  My eyes were starting to open.  Another important book along the way, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man."  I learned how money worked, from ancient times until central banker "play" money times.  I learned about the shadow banking system, about the fraud and cheating that happens on Wall St.  I realized that you'll never hear much of the "truth" by watching TV, especially "financial news".  
But I had to dig.  I had to spend time.  I had to read.  I had to listen.  I watched the Keiser Report, I bought and read books written by their guests.  I had to take long hikes and THINK long and hard.  Most people are clueless about all of this.  Some have been brainwashed with Keynesian bullshit - and they are typically hopelessly misinformed.  
When I read, "The Bitcoin Standard," and he explained how you kind of need to understand the history of money in order to appreciate Bitcoin, that was yet another light bulb moment for me.  
Now: The biggest financial disaster - ever - is approaching, and most people I've met, some of them very smart, have no clue.  
Thank you for the reminder that the typical person has spent just about zero hours trying to understand any of this.

Hold it right there, please.  
Stop.  
Think about something: **negative interest rates**.
According to Dr. Michael Hudson, who has studied "money" (and debt) in its various forms going all the way back to the **Bronze Age**, there have never been negative interest rates in history.  And now the central banks are talking about lowering rates and have **Quantitative Easing** (money 'printing') forever.  
**Negative interest rates scream, "SHIT IS SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP."**
Let me use an analogy: The car is aflame, pretty soon the gas tank will explode, and some dufus writing for Bloomberg says, in effect, "Um, you might need a tune up soon."
**Get real.**

@_date: 2019-10-01 00:15:11
Uncertainty?  Doubt?
Just look at the current global financial system, based upon central bank fiat "play" money.  Look at all the "money printing" under fancy names.  Look at the too big to fail banks, about to fail again.  Look at past bail outs, and bail ins.  Think about what's coming next.  
Did anything get fixed after 2008/9?  No.  
And here we are, again, on the brink of another total financial melt-down.  What you ought to be doubting is what you hear on mainstream "news" media.  What you ought to be doubting is anything from the lips of a Keynesian "economist".  What you ought to be doubting is the ability of your government to survive the next financial crisis.  
One of the few things you need to doubt at this time is Bitcoin.

Schiff says Bitcoin can't be money because he can't hold it in his hand.
The fact that people have been using Bitcoin as money for over ten years proves Schiff to be wrong.
Schiff, being a gold salesman is either attacking something he doesn't understand which would tell us that he has some serious mental issues, or, (more likely) that he's willing to lie about it and to keep lying and lying and lying about it and continuing to deny the truth -- making Schiff a sociopathic lair.

 Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Republic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 37 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

Get out of debt, then stay out of debt.
Save an emergency cash cushion: enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).
In addition to that, save up for your old age (don't count on government programs). Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets. Make sure one of those baskets is Bitcoin.
Don't bother with "alt-coins".
Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.
Don't invest money you might need for something else w/in the next 2 or 3 years.
Buy some Bitcoin, learn how to buy, then transfer to and from your own wallet. Learn what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works. Learn about "money" (eg, read "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous and/or watch:  )
Remember: not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Don't store your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange/web site/etc. any longer than necessary.
Once you've learned the basics of how to, then consider investing more and more.
Beware of scams/scammers. This includes people touting their "TA" (technical analysis). TA is bullshit - sadly, even smart people can fall for it. Don't "loan" your Bitcoin to anyone. Fools and their money are soon parted. Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.
Buy, then hold, long term. Be patient. Don't panic. Eventually, you'll get used to wild price movements. Don't bother trying to time the market. Be wise.
Protect your private key(s) -- and keep a back up of the key(s) and/or "seed words" in a secure off-site location.
Don't go around blabbing that you own a lot of Bitcoin - you could make yourself (or family members) targets for kidnapping and/or home invasion robberies.

Fiat money has inherent flaws.  Another way to put it: central bank money has built-in defects which cause it to self destruct after a few decades.
Guess how long the world has been using fiat money?  A few decades.
Remember the financial crisis of 2008?  Guess what -- it's still with us; nothing got fixed.  The global, central banking fiat money system has been on "life support" for more than a decade and now it looks about ready to die.  The so-called "news" isn't going to tell you this.  Still, the truth is out there for anybody with enough brains to slow down and listen to it.
So, **fiat money is going to die**.  When it does, some will return to gold, and the rest of us will turn to Bitcoin (if we haven't already).  Maybe we'll use BTC for every little transaction.  Maybe not.  But certainly something will need to replace the USD as the de facto Global Reserve Currency.  I'm 100% convinced that Bitcoin will become the de facto Global Reserve currency.
When you look at the big picture, you see kind of where this is all going (the 'vision').  At first you think, "Hurry up, it will happen in the next hour or two..."  But, really, these things take time.  There is progress, then set backs, and more progress.  Eventually, you get to see it unfold, in a very slow motion.  In the big scheme of things, the fact that the price of BTC went up $1500 and then went right back down won't matter, just like when it crashed from $30 to $1, or from $250 to $40...  today's price of BTC in USD does not define Bitcoin, nor its future, and neither does it fix any of the built-in flaws of the USD and other central bank fiat currencies.

Bitcoin is a new kind of money.  
Meanwhile, central bank fiat "play money" is in deep trouble.  One symptom: negative interest rates.  There are asset bubbles, created by excessive "money printing" by the central banks: stocks, bonds, real estate...  Those bubbles will pop.  The US Dollar will be rekt forever and ever.  
So far, the long-term average Bitcoin ROI has been over 100%.  It has been beating the pants off of stocks, real estate, gold, everything -- and there's no reason to believe it will stop any time soon.
Stocks can be confiscated.  Bitcoin cannot be taken by force.

I started to learn to program "Solidity".  I lost faith in it.  For example, one tiny, non-obvious mistake can wipe out a lot of money.  It's not realistic to expect computer programs to be perfect.  
Then, apparently their blockchain isn't immutable.  That's another turn off.
I bought some Etherium, "just in case" (before I started to learn about Solidity).  You know, I don't think about it, I don't check the price, I really don't care.
Maybe some group should examine the lessons learned from Etherium and start over, from scratch?  I don't know.  So far, Etherium is not living up to its hype.

Bottom line: Unless you're really into it, and know what you're doing, paper wallets can have serious pitfalls.
1. Use a computer not connected to the Internet, the NEVER connect it to the Internet again.  He's got a point.
2. Printer: yes, the printer part can be problematic.
3. Multiple addresses: Yes.  For the reason he said, plus more.
4. The next point (4:21) is "maybe".  You can look at, say, [blockchain.info]( to see transactions related to a public address.  I'm pretty sure you can trust them, and that if one of them started lying... word would get out.  Still: you can use paper wallet(s) AND run a full node!
5. Raw private keys.  He's right - you need to be careful.  If you fuck up, your money is gone.  So, be careful.  Or, use a decent Hardware Wallet purchased directly from the manufacturer (not Amazon or eBay).
6. Brain wallets: he's got a good point, again.  Don't use brain wallets.
Some claims, like "losing your Bitcoins forever" if the new wallet doesn't recognize your paper wallet's format... I disagree.  Javascript cryptography... nothing wrong there.  The problem is the SEED.  Generate your own seed with a six-sided die.  Start with a good random number and Javascript cryptography is fine.  This is nitpicking: still, the problem is the random number generator, not the "cryptography".  Maybe to some people there is no difference.

Buy, then hold, long term.  Be more patient than you have ever been about anything in your life.  Don't let fear make you panic, no matter what happens.
Frequent traders end up broke.
Don't invest funds you might need within the next two or three years - you don't want to end up having to sell for a loss, you want to have a strong hand.
Buy a little, then learn (maybe make mistakes, etc.), then increase your holdings.  When you know what, "not your keys, not your Bitcoins," means and why, then you're getting the hang of things.

Most fiat currency exists only in digital form in centralized computer systems.  Relatively little is actually, physically printed onto notes or stamped into metal coins.  Thus, a central bank can create many trillions of dollars worth of their fiat "play" money by merely typing numbers into a bank computer.  This is how/where fiat currencies become corrupted.  
Meanwhile, in fractional reserve lending systems money is created from thin air when loans are made.  For example, a bank might receive a $100 deposit, then lend $90 of it.  That $90 becomes a deposit at a bank, and $81 of it might be lent, becoming yet another deposit at a bank... and so on.  Eventually, from that $100 deposit, close to $900 might have been created following the process [this example uses a 10% reserve, as an example].  
If such a loan is repaid or goes bad, money is destroyed -- it returns into the thin air whence it came.
History has countless examples of fiat currencies which lost all of their value; today's fiat currencies are following that familiar path to zero, thanks to the central banks.
Bitcoin will suffer no such fate.  It's supply is strictly limited, from the beginning, by design.

When you hear/read about banking or financial "elites," remember that there is no such thing.  Those people aren't inherently "better" than the rest of us; they're not smarter; they don't work harder, or longer.  They're not "elite," rather they are leeches and criminals.
All men are created equal.
Yet we have a small group with the sole ability to *legally* **create all the fiat money they want, from thin air, backed by nothing,** which they use to further enrich and empower themselves and their cronies ***at the expense of the rest of us***.  This is morally wrong.  Those "money printers" (central bankers) are thieves, stealing from the rest of us.

In no particular order:
The current global debt bubble: the "Mother of All Debt Bubbles".  The symptoms of that bubble: Stock market bubbles, housing bubbles, bond bubbles.  Government debts.  It is not sustainable.
The central banks have had to keep the major economies on "life support" for over ten years: ZIRP/NIRP, QE (aka "money printing").  Think about "negative interest rates" -- that's where we are -- what does that say about the condition we're in?
The USD has been the de facto global reserve currency.  Several countries have been working hard for the last decade or so to get to the point where they can ditch/escape USD hegemony.  This includes things like stockpiling hundreds of tons of gold and creating alternative international settlement systems for trading oil and other goods.  The US has effectively been using the dollar as a weapon -- people don't like that -- and it isn't sustainable.
The history of fiat money is very clear -- it always fails.  It has a short life expectancy.  (Nixon took the US off the gold standard in 1971... the "fiat" version of the dollar is at/near the end of its life expectancy.)
There has been, and continues to be a currency war - on a global scale.  This is not sustainable. 
There is an alternative to fiat money now: Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has risk, but it also has a huge upside potential (long term).
Unlike fiat cash, no banker, no politician, nobody can create any amount of Bitcoin from "thin air".  Everybody must follow the same rules.  The supply of Bitcoin over time has been programmed/set in place since the beginning.  Thus, nobody can inflate or hyper inflate Bitcoin's value.  No banker nor government can seize/freeze my Bitcoin account.
Unlike gold, Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up no space.  It cannot be detected by metal detectors or dogs or visually.   Gold is expensive to store securely.  Gold is very expensive and slow to transport securely.  Bitcoin costs nothing (or very little) to store securely, and little to transport securely and quickly.  There is a lot of "paper gold" depressing its price.  There is tungsten-filled gold.
Real estate has risk and high holding costs (mortgage interest, insurance, maintenance, taxes).  Real estate tends to be in a bubble at this time, depending on your location.  Real estate is not portable.  Its price tends to depend upon the ability of people to obtain favorable loans.

I must Heartily Commend you for admitting you don't know much, if anything.  You start with a blank page upon which you may now write the truth - and the truth will set you free, or at least put you ahead of where you might have ended up otherwise.

Here is a great book, if you're at all into reading (I highly recommend this book): "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.
u/[Extrakredit]( and u/[ThisGuyHodls]( have given you good advice.
There's no rush.  Still, don't take too long: do a little research, then buy a good hardware wallet **directly from the manufacturer** (not from ebay, amazon, craigslist, etc).
From the coinbase site you'll be able to "send" some/all of your Bitcoin to the hardware wallet (it will give you the address to send it to).  Maybe send 1/10th of your BTC the first time, just in case.  When you see that you're able to do it correctly, send the rest.

I appreciate what you're saying, and I appreciate the thought energy you put into it, and that you took the time to post it here.  
I'm reluctant to agree, however, because most people don't have a clue.  I'm talking about the general population.  How many people are there who have never even heard of Bitcoin (percentage-wise)?  Of those who have heard of it, they're aware that there is something called "Bitcoin", how many (percentage-wise) have a correct understanding of what Bitcoin actually is, and the very basics of how it works?  Even within people who are aware of Bitcoin and have a vague, yet correct-enough notion of what it is, how many of them are aware of the halving event?  How many are aware of the serious and significant problems/challenges happening right now within the fiat currency based global financial system?  How many of them even have any significant amount of money to invest in Bitcoin?  
Thus, I'm not convinced about your conclusion.  I am convinced that the stock-to-flow ratio matters in a significant way.  Still, I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm saying, "I don't know, and I'm not convinced that you know, even if you do know."  Did that make sense?

I like his clever way of circumnavigating the typical non-believer's preconceived notions.  It does take more than 12 seconds to explain, however.  That's just the way it is.  
Get in now, or get left behind.  That's just the way it is.  
I first read about the coming "digital revolution" in the late 1970's.  Alvin (and Heidi) Toffler: "The Third Wave".  I decided to ride the third wave, and it has been very stimulating and rewarding in many ways.  
He mentioned the truck driver example - a good example.  Let's back up in time, however, to the era before internal combustion engines.  There were no trucks, there no truck driver jobs.  Instead, there were plows pulled by animals.  There were horse-drawn carts.  There were blacksmiths to make horseshoes. Etc.  Most of those jobs went away but were replaced by truck driving jobs, tractor drivers, automobile assembly line workers, auto mechanics, highway construction, etc.  Still, the transition phase is brutally painful for many involved.  
If I were a truck driver, I'd be doing a lot of head-scratching.  Actually, if I were a truck driver I'd likely be ignorant of the changes heading my way.

I got the idea from a "film appreciation" professor in college.  I went to him, "I'm supposed to be paying attention to the lighting, the camera angles and lenses, the scene composition, the editing... but I get caught up in the movie and forget."

You are missing the entire point of Bitcoin.
It was not invented as a way to put fiat money in and then get even more fiat money back out later, if you're lucky.
There are serious, inherent issues with fiat money -- I suggest you find out what they are before it's too late for you to do anything about it.  Taking some profit is not one of them.

The wallet I've used might not be the best for you, depending on what device you'll run it on (lap top, server, smart phone, Raspberry Pi, etc.), how much security you want...
A lot of people here say good things about the "hardware wallets" (like Ledger, and others).  
Oh yes: forgot to mention: you'll need to back up your "wallet" (or, more likely, your "seed phrase").  If I had to get a wallet now, I'd pick one that let me use a "seed phrase".  This way, you can write down those exact words in their exact order, make a copy, then store the second copy in a secure offsite location, like, in case your home burns to the ground, you won't lose your Bitcoins, too.  The idea is, you can get another copy of the wallet, then tell it your "seed phrase" and be good to go again.  That's pretty cool and convenient.
Let the wallet software generate a random seed phrase for you.  Then make two copies and store them securely in separate locations.

Bitcoin has limits.  Blocks are mined, on average, every ten minutes.  Each block has a finite size, and each transaction has a non-zero size, therefore, only so-many transactions will fit into a block.
Transactions-per-block times blocks-per-hour gives us transactions per hour, which is easily converted to transactions per minute or transactions per second.  For Bitcoin, the number of transactions per second is relatively small compared to Visa transactions, for example.
So, what about "mesh networks".  Mesh networks don't change the block size, nor the transactions per hour.  Mesh networks allow "nodes" to communicate without going through infrastructure controlled by ISPs and/or governments.  Mesh networks do not increase the maximum number of Bitcoin transactions per second.
Lightning Network is an attempt to increase the overall number of Bitcoin transactions by a very large factor.

Store it in your own wallet, not on any exchange.
Read, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous, where chapter 10 has a section about "altcoins".  Well written.
Don't invest heavily in things you don't yet understand.  
Don't invest money you might need in the next year or two.  
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  
Don't delude yourself into thinking you can "outsmart" (beat) the overall market; don't get into frequent trading.  
Do learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the very basics of how it works.  
Do learn about the inherent flaws in the current, global, central banking (fractional reserve, supposedly) system, the present "Mother of All Debt Bubbles", etc.  
Do learn to relax and enjoy the "bumpy ride" known as Bitcoin.

For example: A typical oil tanker carries (and delivers) about $80 Million worth of oil.  Suppose the company or country from which the oil came is being unfairly sanctioned, that is, they can't accept US Dollars for payment.  
They might accept gold as payment.  Right?  One load of oil is worth more than one and a half tons of pure gold.  Compare the  TRUST, COST EFFECTIVENESS, and EFFICIENCY of moving one and a half tons (or more) of gold around the globe for every such tanker delivery.  For example, how do you know the "gold bars" you receive aren't embedded with tungsten?  How do you know your tanker won't be robbed by pirates on it's way home?  How much does it cost to get 3,300 pounds of gold from the bank down to the dock, SECURELY?  How long would it take?
Oh, but you could securely send $80 Million worth of Bitcoin across the globe, and have several confirmations, for a few dollars, in about an hour, maybe two hours.

If all you know about Bitcoin is the price, then you seriously lack "understanding".
I always encourage everybody to:
* Learn *what* Bitcoin atutally *IS*
* Learn the very basics of how Bitcoin works
* Learn a bit about what "money" is, the various forms of money people have used in the past and the forms currently in use today
* Open your mind to the ugly realities of the current "central bank fiat play money" system \[Hint: central bankers still use gold, hundreds of tons of gold -- they know better than to put any faith in the fiat currency crap they peddle to the rest of us\]
I've not met ONE PERSON who actually understood Bitcoin who did not also hold it, long term.

If you're sure you can do without that money for two years or so, you might consider it.  
You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you bought BTC at one price, then its price fell, then you "need" some of that "cash" all of a sudden -- you'd have to sell BTC at a loss in that case.
Also, don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.  Maybe buy a comfortable amount of Bitcoin, then take time to learn:
* What Bitcoin actually is
* The basics of how it works
* The inherent problems of fiat money/banking
* How to properly secure your Bitcoin
For example, if you're going to fuck up and lose some Bitcoin, it's better to learn by losing a smaller amount.
Welcome to Bitcoin, by the way!

First, Bitcoin isn't a "currency," strictly speaking.
Second, you make up rules that I'm "supposed to" obey?  Fuck that noise.
Third, stocks are also volatile.  
Forth, Bitcoin goes up in value much, much faster than stocks.
Fifth, a wise person will have some of their wealth parked in lots of different things, including, but not limited to: liquid cash, stocks (index fund, yes), Bitcoin, etc.  
The best thing to invest in is yourself.  Learn a good "trade" -- always be learning.  Learn to appreciate art in its various forms: visual, music, food, wine, film, poetry, sculpture, architecture, theater, opera, literature, etc.  Invest in your health: stay fit, exercise, don't eat (much) junk food, don't smoke, don't drink too much, get enough sleep/rest, relax/meditate/manage stress... Invest in meaningful relationships (like, put down your stupid phone and have an actual conversation with another human being).

Nothing.  It doesn't need to be backed by anything.
People used to store gold with their local goldsmith.  They'd drop off some gold, and the goldsmith would give them a receipt, a "note" which could be redeemed for a specific amount of gold.   Those were "gold backed notes".  They were "backed by" gold -- the note, in and of itself had no intrinsic value.  The fact that it was "backed by" an amount of gold from a particular goldsmith made that note much more valuable than any ordinary slip of paper.
Eventually, we had "banks" storing gold in their vaults and issuing bank notes backed by that gold.
So - what backed the gold?
Nothing.  Gold doesn't need to be backed by anything. 
Why not?
Because gold has all seven properties necessary to be "sound money":
* Durable
* Divisible
* Fungible
* Portable
* Recognizable
* Scarce/rare
* Difficult to produce or counterfeit
Guess what?
Bitcoin has all seven properties necessary to be considered "sound money".

How long do I have?
Given enough time/space I'd explain how central bank "money printing" is theft, and theft is evil.  I'd mention that fiat money always fails.  What about our fiat money?  It's failing as we speak.  Then I'd explain that the smart ones are already using a new KIND of money, one that doesn't have the inherent flaws of fiat money.
I'd compare it to gold.  What backs gold?  Nothing!  Gold backs itself because it has these seven properties necessary for "good money":
 * Portable, durable, divisible, fungible, recognizable, rare/scarce, and difficult to counterfeit and/or produce.
Bitcoin has all 7 properties, too.
Then I'd point out that gold is expensive and slow to transport securely, and expensive to store securely... maybe mention tungsten...
I'd mention that Bitcoin is inexpensive and fast to transport securely, and virtually free to store securely.  Also, the government cannot confiscate it, and it won't set of metal detectors.
Under the hood: It's just a ledger.  But no criminal banker can create big piles of it from thin air.

Yes.  Let it be known that when we use the verb "print" alongside the noun "money" that we are using a figure of speech.  We are not saying that the Federal Reserve literally prints Federal Reserve notes.
When we say "print" alongside "money" we mean that they are creating "digital" dollars within their bank's computers, out of thin air, backed by nothing.
I typically put "print" in quotation marks.  For example, when a central bank "prints" money from thin air, backed by nothing, they are stealing.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:08:29

The rich would get richer at the expense of the rest.   The problems with proof of stake haven't really been solved yet.
Also, Bitcoin mining only uses a fraction of one percent of all electrical power used globally.  Furthermore, about three fourths of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy sources (hydroelectric, solar, etc.)  You're trying to solve a problem that is relatively unimportant.

After that, have fun, show off your equipment, complain about your sister's hair, whatever, but keep coming back to your Gold Nugget.
At the end, repeat your Gold Nugget, plain and simple.
You have something to say.  A gold nugget.  Say it.  Say it BEFORE I start looking for the back button.  Why?  Because I really DO want to hear what you have to say, but not necessarily after watching 8, 9, or 10 minutes of you jumping around from topic to topic.

The point is: Central banks are doing the same kind of thing to us, right now, and have been for years -- and the results will be devastating.
Mr. Maloney explains it nicely.  His solution is to hoard gold, which isn't as good as Bitcoin (in my opinion), but is still WAY better that holding fiat money.

Whether you're crazy or not, it's okay - it is what it is.  
You don't have to buy one entire Bitcoin.  You can buy $5 worth, or $100, $500... whatever you're comfortable with (and able to keep for a long time).  
You don't want to put everything into one investment, have that investment go down, lose your job (through no fault of your own) or have some other financial emergency, and then be forced to sell at a loss.  So, only put money in that you know you won't need for up to three years (or longer).
Maybe buy a small amount.  With that, learn about how the exchange works.  How to use your wallet and protect your private keys.  Etc.  With a small amount, if/when you fuck up, the lesson only costs you $5 or $10, not $8,400... At the same time, learn what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works.  In fact, you can start doing that right now - for example, this intro video:

No.  
Today we have a small group (central bankers) who have the sole ability to create as much money as they want, from thin air, backed by nothing.  To create their money only requires them to enter numbers into bank computers.  
That group then uses the newly created money to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  **This is the root of the wealth gap**.  Fiat money gets "printed," then used to purchase assets, that is, actual wealth.  
**This cannot happen with Bitcoin**.  No central banker, no government official, nobody can just "print" loads of Bitcoin -- it must be mined, according to the rules / protocol / algorithm.  Bitcoin's supply is extremely limited.  
Will some people get into Bitcoin early, then become fabulously rich as a result?  Yes.  In fact, many already have.  Is this fair?  Yes, because those individuals were paying attention, saw through the FUD, and those individuals took risks (they could have lost, and in the case of shitcoins and scams, actually did).

Suppose there is a huge exchange with some addresses containing huge amounts of BTC.
Suppose Joe buys 0.1 BTC from that exchange, and the exchange merely takes note, that is, they credit Joe's account with 0.1 BTC and ding his cash account for $1103 (whatever), without actually moving any Bitcoin...
Meanwhile, Alice buys 3.2 BTC.  Again, the huge exchange merely updates their internal "database".
Later, Joe chickens out, and sells his 0.1 BTC.  Again, a mere accounting transaction completely within the exchange.  
Still later, Alice knows, "not my keys, not my Bitcoin," and she transfers her BTC to her hardware wallet.  NOW an actual, on-blockchain transaction happens, involving 3.2 BTC.

A unique revolution is happening as we speak.  
For over a hundred years, most people have been ruled by a small group of people who just happen to have the sole ability to legally create all the fiat money they want and to distribute it amongst themselves and selected cronies -- enriching and empowering themselves and their clique at the expense of the rest of us.  They own most of the wealth in the world: land, stocks, companies, precious resources, and **mass media outlets**.  They also own and operate the politicians (both parties), the so-called regulators, judges, etc.  
Many years ago I mentioned this to somebody who replied, "What are you going to **do** about it?"  
I gave it some serious thought.  I watched videos of people rioting in Spain, for example.  I realized how easy it would be to fuck up a whole bunch of riot police in a hurry.  Then I realized, that's just what they want us to do.  The riot police are not the problem.  The money-printing oligarchs are the problem.  If we fuck up the riot police, the evil oligarchs will have an excuse to roll out the military and "temporarily" suspend our liberties.  They seem to be taunting us to fuck with their stooges we call cops.  More thought and I realized, the best way to unhinge the oligarchs is to cut off their supply line -- their only source of power is their ability to legally "print" money.  Back then, it seemed like the best way to revolt was to become a gold/silver bug.  
**But then I read the Bitcoin white paper**... So wonderful.  This is it!  The solution.  The best way to fight back against financial tyranny is to stop using central banker "play money" and (as much as possible) start using money they can't just "print" at will: gold, silver, **and Bitcoin.**  
Meanwhile, it turns out that fiat money always goes to zero, and today's central bank currencies are no exception.  Interest rates got stuck on zero, and are now turning negative -- this is the last gasp spasm before the death spiral for the USD, Yen, Yuan, Pound, Euro, etc.  
Whether a bunch of people stop using central bank money or not, it is going to collapse because of its inherent and significant flaws.  
At this point **I see Bitcoin as a life boat or life preserver on a rapidly sinking Titanic.**  I see it as a way to protect (at least some of) my hard-earned wealth from tyrannical taxation, outright theft, and from outrageous "money printing".  
I also see Bitcoin becoming the **global reserve currency** as the USD hegemony caves in.
Have a nice day.

Meanwhile, we have a small group of central bankers who think they're superior to us, and that they're entitled to create all the fiat money they want, then use it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.  
We have a large number of ignorant citizens who have been duped to believe that the government exists to give them stuff, taking it (by force) from others if necessary.  Although, more and more of them seem to think that the government can create housing, food, medical care, etc. from thin air.  These people also tend to wrongly believe that whatever meager, limited rights they have, they got from the government, because the government is their god, and the government loves them and wants them to have, say, the freedom of speech, but not too much...

What is a Ponzi scheme?
In  a Ponzi scheme there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one  person, or a small group), a swindler.  The swindler receives money from  people, promising them that their money will be invested in some  business venture with an expected high rate of return.  That money is  NOT invested.  There is no money-making business venture.  Any returns  are paid from the swindled money.  The entire thing is based upon a big,  fat lie.  The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers  arrive to put their money into it.  A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a  "crash".  A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin makes no promises.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin  is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an  immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.
How can somebody call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?

If you believe that the ultimate price of Bitcoin is going to be higher than today, then the rebalancing method works against you (relative to buy-and-hold).
If you believe that the ultimate price of Bitcoin is down, that is, will never be higher than it is today (in your lifetime), then you should sell all of it now.  Again, rebalancing works against you.
If you're certain that the long term price of Bitcoin will be today's price **and** you can exchange cash/Bitcoin for free **and** Bitcoin gains are not taxed in your country/state, then you can come out slightly ahead by employing the rebalancing method.  If you can exchange fiat and Bitcoin for free, please share how you do that with the rest of us.

For a while, when asked, "what backs Bitcoin?" I would mention, the mining hash rate, the cryptography, etc.
Then somebody explained to me that a backed currency is one that a commodity backs or supports, namely a precious metal like silver or gold.  The idea is/was that you could take your bank-note to a bank and exchange it on the spot for the gold or silver by which it was backed.
Well, it turns out that Bitcoin is more like the gold than the bank note.  You don't "deposit" electrical power at a "bank" and get a note that you can later redeem for the same amount of electrical power, which the bank had somehow stored in their "vault".
I suppose you could pay your electric bill with Bitcoin and say, "technically speaking, Bitcoin is backed by electrical power".  Hmm.  Electrical power is fungible.

We are approaching "strike three," according to Jim Rickards (a stubborn gold bug, btw).  First strike was when Asian markets "froze up" in 1998 and nearly locked up the entire global financial system.  Strike two was in 2008/9 - where again we were mere hours away from a total global market meltdown.  He says that strike three, which is coming soon, will be "the end".
Our payment cards will stop working.  There will be an extended "banking holiday" -- but it won't be a "fun" holiday.  People won't be able to borrow to buy cars.  People won't be able to get mortgages...  People won't be able to buy gasoline with their payment/credit cards, nor groceries...

As far as I'm concerned one, and only one of the following must be true:
* Schiff still doesn't understand Bitcoin
* He does understand Bitcoin
Bitcoin has been very carefully explained to him by several smart and articulate people.
If he doesn't get it by now, he's stupid.
If he does, then he's a liar for going around saying untrue things about it.
It is my opinion that Schiff is not retarded, stupid, too dumb.  Therefore, he is willingly lying about Bitcoin, in an attempt to boost his own financial gain (through is gold dealing business) -- and this makes him a fraudster, because fraud is the act of lying for financial gain.

Fiat money is fake money.  Fiat money has a relatively short life expectancy.  The USD has officially been fiat money since 1971, when Nixon had to admit we'd left the gold standard.
Fiat money is doomed, with or without Bitcoin.
There will be no orderly cutover.  No planned transition.  Instead, there will be the "last straw"... the final "snow flake" will land near the mountain peak and set off an avalanche.  There's too much debt, derivatives, and fraud.  Way too much fraud.  The current system will largely collapse, like a house of cards.  Some will be better prepared than others.

If you buy any significant amount of BTC now, or in the past, and it reaches one dollar per sat, you'll be able to afford to say, "Keep the change."
Seriously, as the value of the USD falls and people (rightly) lose faith in it, there comes a point of "no return" known technically as "permanent backwardation" -- at this point, people won't trade their gold or Bitcoin or labor for **any** amount of USD.  At that point, the USD joins the long list of "failed currencies".  That event is likely to happen long before the price of BTC reaches one hundred million dollars per Bitcoin.

We have a very small group (central bankers) with the sole ability to "print" all the money they want, whenever they want, and to give it to whomever they want.  This is theft.  Theft is wrong.  
Sine 2008 or so, this small group has created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play" money, from thin air, and have used it to enrich themselves and their cronies at our expense.  That's right - you are being robbed by bankers whether you realize it or not.  
Not only that, but these same people have allowed institutions to form which they claim are "too big to fail".  Since 2008/9 they have not broken these institutions into to smaller entities, rather, they have allowed them to grow even larger than before.  This is beyond irresponsible.  This is also a form of **central planning**, which is what led to the collapse of the former Soviet Union.  
When they decide which businesses "can't fail", they are acting as **central planners**, and history has shown, over and over, that **central planning always ends up failing**.
So, buck the fanks.

\&gt;  U.S. Dollar has been survived since 1776.
Not really.  Since 1913 (when the Federal Reserve began) the US Dollar has lost more than 95% of its purchasing power / value.  
In 1971, Nixon removed the US Dollar from the gold standard.  The dollar's value has deteriorated significantly since then.  
Now our central bank is stuck on zero percent interest rates, endless "money printing" (called QE and lately via 'repo' operations) -- they're ready to implement negative interest rates.  
Negative interest rates.  
Let that sink in for a minute.  
Negative interest rates tell us that this currency (USD) is TOAST.  It is dying before our very eyes.
Really, the dollar is backed by nothing.  If you have "full faith" in the US government, you lack understanding.  For example, the US government has hundreds of Trillions of dollars of debt, including unfunded liabilities which aren't going to be repaid.
When a currency is "backed by" gold, for example, that means that anybody can walk into a bank and exchange their "bank note" for the amount (weight) of gold printed on the note.  You cannot walk into a bank and exchange a hundred dollar bill for some physical amount of "faith in the government".  Therefore, it is not correct to say (or repeat) that the dollar is "backed by" something -- it is not.  US Dollars are created when the Federal Reserve writes a "bad check" and gives it to the Treasury.  The Federal Reserve has no money in its checking account.  If you or I write "bad checks" we end up in jail.  
The US Dollar is technically a piece of shit, backed by nothing.  Sadly, uninformed and misinformed people still believe in it -- but that's about to change in a big hurry.

No altcoin has any reason to exist; they are purely speculative bubbles preying on the ignorance of people who think there'll be Bitcoin 2.0

Get out of debt.
Stay out of debt.
Save an emergency cash cushion.
Save up for a car - buy a reliable, economical car.  (This, in addition to your emergency cushion.)
When your car is old (half it's life expectancy), you need to start saving for the next one (they wear out, need maintenance, etc.)
Invest your TIME and energy into acquiring marketable job skills.  Never stop doing this step, even when you're old -- *especially* when you grow old.
Learn to save money.  Put some/most of it in Bitcoin and hold it **long term**.
Key: Bitcoin is a long term savings investment, not a guaranteed "get rich quick" scheme.  Get rich slowly, but get rich.

To answer your question, here's my plan:
Someday I will buy my dream home in a neighborhood that's just right for me -- and I'll trade some of my Bitcoin for it.  Or, I'll just rent my dream home.
Someday I won't have to work to pay my monthly bills, and I'll be able to change careers and do things that help people, things that help make this world an even better place than I found it.  Perhaps I'll teach.  Perhaps I'll be a park ranger.  Perhaps I'll help bring clean water and sanitation to poor people around the world -- these alternatives will have been made possible by Bitcoin.

Good and reasonable question.  You are "alert" as Dave Barry used to say.
There is nothing to stop them, in fact, they won't be able to NOT go to more negative rates, more QE (more "money printing").  For me, it's a given.  "You can't taper a Ponzi scheme," and fiat money is one huge Ponzi scheme.
Looking at central banks, their only tool to treat the symptoms of "too much money printing" is to print even more money.  It's absurd, but that's the way it is.  Thing is, "printing more money" is not infinitely sustainable.  Just ask the Venezuela, Argentina, Japan, the (former) Soviet Union, Zimbabwe, the Weimar Republic (1920's 'Germany'), and so many others.
They cannot "print" prosperity, except for themselves -- but they ultimately destroy the underlying economy when they crank up the "printing presses".
Notice I put "print" in quotation marks.  Why?  Because these days, the central bankers don't even have to print up paper "rag money".  They merely type numbers into a computer, hit "enter" and **poof**, they've created another trillion or two.
So, that's what they'll do.  And their fiat currencies will collapse quickly.  And then the other fiat currencies will collapse.  And their entire bullshit fraud system will collapse.  Yay!
Remember: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.  The central bankers and their cronies turned into hogs a while ago; now they are about to get "slaughtered" (figuratively speaking, at least).
In the past, we just had to use their money and "take it".  Now we have a choice.  More and more people are choosing sound money (Bitcoin) every day.

Internet money.
How it works: You exchange your fake money for Bitcoin, which is a form of real money.  Then you wait.
While you wait, the fake money loses value and the real money buys more and more stuff, the longer you wait.  In ten years, you get to live like a millionaire.
Say grandma gave you money for your Birthday; she sent you enough money to buy a **case** of good beer.  Since you're only 5, you have to wait to buy beer.  You put your $50 in a box and wait.  When you're 15, your money might only buy 4 **bottles** of beer because of criminal bankers.  By the time you're 21, you might only be able to buy one or two bottles of beer.  The criminal bankers stole most of your beer you waited for.  Shame on them!
Instead, you buy Bitcoin with the money grandma sent you for your birthday.  By the time you're 16 you can buy a  **car** with your Bitcoin.  But you wait.  By the time you're 21, you buy your own **brewery or a bar**.  Sell beer to other people.  No need to go to college, though you should study how to run a business/bar before you buy one, and maybe get some jobs working in bars/restaurants so you have some experience.
That's how Bitcoin works.

BTC, technically, can replace gold.
There are still people who think that what makes gold special is your ability to hold it in your hand.
Gold is expensive to store securely.  Gold is very expensive to transport securely (especially in large amounts).  Bitcoin is fast and inexpensive to transport securely. Bitcoin costs virtually nothing to store securely.
Gold is heavy and takes up space.  Gold sets off metal detectors.  Bitcoin takes up no space and weighs nothing; it cannot be detected by airport security, police, police dogs, breathalyzers, etc.
Gold will continue to be mined.  In theory, asteroids could be mined for gold, someday.  There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

What is a Ponzi scheme?
In   a Ponzi scheme there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one   person, or a small group), a swindler.  The swindler receives money from   people, promising them that their money will be invested in some   business venture with an expected high rate of return.  That money is   NOT invested.  There is no money-making business venture.  Any returns   are paid from the swindled money.  The entire thing is based upon a big,   fat lie.  The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers   arrive to put their money into it.  A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a   "crash".  A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin makes no promises.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin   is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an   immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.
How can somebody call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?

Yes, you are not just an investor, you are a wise investor if you buy and hold, long-term.
Frequent traders typically end up broke, for various reasons.
Buying and holding is easy in that you don't need to do much besides wait; it's difficult at times until you get used to the wild price swings, up AND down... resisting the urge to sell.  Be patient.  So far, patient, buy-and-hold investors have been seriously rewarded.  I see no reason for that to change any time soon.

The people who say it uses too much electricity don't know what they're talking about.  They heard or read  that bullshit myth, then, like a little parrot, they go around repeating it.
To me, it's an instant tip-off that the person saying it is as ignorant as fuck and never stops to double check whether a thing is true or not.
If there was a stack of printer paper, a few inches tall, almost 1000 sheets and it represents All Electrical Power produced and consumed on earth, Bitcoin would be one thin sheet in that stack -- AND -- three fourths of Bitcon's sheet of printer paper comes from renewable (hydroelectric, solar, wind, etc.)
I tell those people:
* I appreciate your concern about the environment
* IF you're really that concerned, you're barking up the wrong tree, wasting your time

All the people I've known who frequently traded Bitcoin eventually lost it all, and "eventually" is usually less than one year.
Every trade has risk and EXPENSE.  Plus, you might need to keep track of tiny details for tax purposes, depending.
Look: In less than a decade, Bitcoin went from tens of dollars per BTC to hundreds per BTC to thousands... and it's still just getting started.  If that's not good enough returns for you, you have other problems which cannot be fixed by merely obtaining "even more wealth".

Frequent traders eventually end up broke due to exposure to needless risk and **fees** for each trade.  Also, you should consider whether or how all that buying and selling could affect your tax paperwork.

TA is nonsense.
Just buy and hold, long term; avoid unnecessary risks, avoid trading platform FEEs, avoid possibly complicating your tax paperwork.
Bitcoin has gone from dollars per BTC, to tens of dollars per BTC, to hundreds, and now thousands of dollars per BTC.  There is no reason for it to stop its long-term growth pattern.
If you want to get rich from the frequent trading of Bitcoin, you need to own and operate a trading platform to collect FEEs from idiot gamblers who are deluded and believe they can beat the long-term market, despite the fees and risks and possible taxes.

2. Buy a calculator, for $1, at the Dollar Store

4. There is a limit.  It's really big.  If/when needed, it could be changed.  Not likely to happen any time soon.
5. I encourage people to learn what Bitcoin actually IS, and the basics of how it works.  I also encourage them to face up to the ugly facts about the current "fiat play money" they've been tricked into using.  In other words, people just need motivation to learn a few things to be able to use Bitcoin, plus, like I said, technology keeps marching forward - we're not "stuck" here.
Wishful thinking:
1. No.
2. Not sure.  But I am certain that Bitcoin will eventually become the de facto Global Reserve Currency.
3. It is futile to guess short-term prices.  It is wise to buy Bitcoin and hold it, long term, say 5, 10, 15 years.  So far, long term holders have been richly rewarded and I see no reason for that trend to diminish any time soon.

Death of the "petrodollar" -- right before our very eyes.
Death of the US Dollar's role as the global reserve currency...  Something will have to take it's place.  Euros?  LOL.  It's just a fiat currency, like the USD.  Let's assume that people learn not to trust a fiat currency to be the global reserve currency based mostly upon recent events.  What next?  
Gold?  
Bitcoin?  
Nothing?  
SDRs?  
**SDRs** are based upon fiat currencies -- it becomes "political" in a hurry.  Did the United Nations bring an end to wars?  Ha ha.  SDRs are based upon a "basket" of fiat currencies... but how much of each... "ours deserves more 'weight' than theirs..."  Hopefully people, in general, will be smart enough not to try to use SDRs as the global reserve currency.  
**Nothing**?  No global reserve currency?  Maybe.  That means that each trade or commodity traded on a global scale must use at least ONE of the others.  Again: it is my hope that people wise up to fiat currencies, and that nobody chooses a fiat currency to base their international trade settlements upon.  
**Gold**?  Ah.  Gold has been around a long, long time.  I certainly has it's strengths.  But it has it's weaknesses: expensive to store securely and extremely expensive to transport securely - especially at the global trade scale.  How about gold-backed money?  Hmm.  Been there, done that.  Here's what ends up happening: USD in the 1960s.  By 1971, oops, we printed way more notes than we have gold to back... this is even more dishonest that fiat money.
**Bitcoin.**  Bitcoin has the same properties which make gold so valuable, but goes beyond gold: inexpensive to store and relatively inexpensive to transport securely.  It's like gold you send through the Internet.  Unlike gold, Bitcoin's supply is strictly limited.  For international trade, Bitcoin becomes the obvious choice.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:04:00
I appreciate your concern for fairness and justice.  This world needs more people like you.  
Let's examine the current causes of extreme wealth inequality and then see how Bitcoin compares and contrasts...  Sorry about the lengthy reply, but this is a relatively complex situation, and the topic is of great importance to a large number of people.
**The Cantillon Effect**.  Central banks create many trillions of dollars worth fiat currencies, from nothing, backed by nothing, by merely typing numbers into bank computers.  They give it fancy names, but it's just old-fashioned "money printing."  The newly "printed" money does not get distributed fairly or evenly.  The central banks use it to enrich and *empower* themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  This "money printing" redistributes *actual wealth* from from the rest of us unto those with close ties to the money "printers" -- it amounts to theft and contributes very heavily to the growing wealth gap we see today.  
Not every person who is ultra-rich got there by being honest, smart, hard working, and obeying the laws.  A few, maybe, but most of them are involved in the systematic theft of wealth as described in the preceding paragraph.  Those people tend to be lazy, short-sighted, and often they are downright inferior -- they can't "make it" in this world without cheating and stealing.  Thus, they don't "get it" when it comes to Bitcoin.  Not yet.  They're not interested in Bitcoin because they can't use it to cheat and steal.  They haven't figured out that their "game" is up.
You have a choice, an opportunity...
The Bitcoin system is fair, in the long run.  Fiat money is inherently unfair and doomed to create gigantic financial catastrophes in the long run.  Bitcoin is going to survive and thrive whether you're on board or not.  
Bitcoin cannot be created by merely typing numbers into computers, as fiat money is.  Bitcoin will never be "printed" (hyperinflated) into oblivion.  Bitcoin is the strongest form of money, ever.  
In the past, throughout history, there has been a cycle where people use gold as money, then gold-backed notes, then just notes, then the crash, then back to gold (again).  This cycle takes generations.  We are currently at the "crash" phase.  But this time, instead of returning to gold, some of us will turn to Bitcoin because Bitcoin has all the properties which make gold a good form of money, AND Bitcoin has certain other properties which make it even better than gold in the information age.  
For example, gold is expensive to store securely.  Gold is extremely expensive (and slow) to transport securely.  Bitcoin costs very little to store securely and Bitcoin can be transported quickly and securely for a nominal fee.

How will Bitcoin conquer?  I never pictured it, or its adherents as being on the offensive.
I've seen the evil central bankers "do their thing" and, well, fuck everything up around them -- even ruin other people's lives.  They're either ignorant fools, or evil liars - or both.  I came to Bitcoin after a search for a "safe haven".  I was so glad to have found it.
Most people don't yet realize they're in (financial) danger.  They've been brainwashed to believe that the central banks (the "Fed") is their savior, the heroes, to the rescue... few realize that the central banks allowed and even caused things like the dot com bubble, the housing bubble, and the crash of 2008/9.  On purpose?  No.  But, clearly, these "bankers" are not "elite".  They seem to think they know what they're doing; clearly, they do not.
History is very clear: fiat money always dies.  Always.  No exceptions.  "What about today's fiat?"  It, too, is failing and about to implode, like all other attempts before it.
I try to warn people.  Everybody thinks they're a money expert, and they're not.  Everybody thinks they know everything they need to know about Bitcoin, but most are completely wrong about it.  A few are willing to listen, learn, and react appropriately while there is still time and ability to do so.  Sadly, most people are ignorant and seem to want to stay that way.  Because of their ignorance, they can't see the true dangers lurking.
Sometimes I think about Noah, building his ark, trying to warn people.  He took heaps of abuse, ridicule, scorn...
...then it started raining.
That's how Bitcoin will end up being the de facto global reserve currency.  When the storm arrives.  People are naturally greedy.  Bankers and big business execs know better than to trust other bankers and business execs.  They'll be late to the party, but they'll be here, eventually.  There's noplace else to go.

Real crypto backs itself - does not need to be backed by a large corp., nor bank, nor government, nor oil reserves, nor gold...
Ask yourself, for example, "When gold backed 'money' (bank notes), what backed gold?"  What backs gold today?  A: Gold backs itself.  How?  It has all seven of the necessary propteries:
* Durable, divisible, portable, fungible, recognizable, scarcity, difficult to produce and/or counterfeit
Bitcoin also has all 7 properties, and thus backs itself.
So, why drag in people who might turn their backs and rip you off, when you can use **the real McCoy, namely Bitcoin**?

It goes back whence it came: thin air.
Literally.  
For example, people take out home loans, and fiat money is created from thin air, on the spot.  When those loans are repaid or when they go bad, money gets destroyed, that is, it just disappears.  
This applies to fractional reserve lending systems, like the one I've lived in.

I have a question, it's pretty basic... you seem to know enough to help me grasp whatever I'm missing.
My current understanding (which is likely not correct!) is that A and B establish a channel and can then send BTC back and forth, back and forth without creating transactions on the BTC blockchain.  That sounds great, for gambling (for example), because of the back and forth, back and forth... 
But that's not how money typically flows.  For me, I get paid.  I never pay my employer(s).  I turn around and pay my electric bill.  They never pay me.  I pay for groceries; they hardly ever pay me (unless I have to return something).  **Does L/N help this kind of situation?**

Welcome to Bitcoin.  
Never fear.  This is not the top for Bitcoin.  This is not the end of the volatility, either.  
Just about every day, there will be volatility, there will be FUD spewed by trolls and mainstream media, there will be self-proclaimed "experts" with their "TA" charts to "prove" what's coming next... There will be spammers, and scammers.  Best of all, there is occasionally real progress.  
My advice: don't try to time the market.  Don't try to pick the next "alt coin".  Consider dollar-cost-averaging.

@_date: 2019-06-19 19:21:22
Let's see...
There is about $12 Trillion dollars worth of "negative interest rate debt" in the world right now.  If that doesn't alarm you, you should get the money back you paid for your education.
Central banks around the world resorted to "QE" (money printing), ZIRP (more money printing), and negative interest rates.  They originally claimed that these were emergency and temporary measures.  That was over ten years ago.  We still have those ostensibly temporary, emergency measures in place.
The global economy has been on "life support" for over a decade.
Now, central banks are admitting that QE is here to stay.  That means they are planning to continue to create trillions and trillions of dollars worth of their central bank fiat currencies, which should now be considered "play money".
I expect that the next downturn will lead us into a collapse of all/most fiat currencies.  Many alive today will live to see the death of "money" as we came to know it.
Not the death of "all money," rather, the rightful death of "play money" (fiat currencies).
Some people will turn to gold, if they haven't already.  Others will turn to Bitcoin, if they haven't already.  Some will turn to both gold and Bitcoin.  A few will prefer silver in addition to or instead of gold/Bitcoin.  
So: the DEMAND for Bitcoin will go up, up, up.  That alone would drive the price higher and higher, as measured in USD.  However, at the same time, due to "money printing" by the Federal Reserve (under whatever fancy label they give it), and due to people fleeing the USD, the value of the USD will fall (inflation, hyperinflation).  This inflation will amplify the already rising price of Bitcoin, as measured in USD.
Bitcoin will eventually replace the USD as the de facto Global Reserve Currency -- YET, there will only ever be, at most, 21 million BTC, ever (and likely a few million of them are already lost forever).  So, do the math: Global trade using at most 21 million BTC.  Will the price of BTC fall to the point where people are practically giving them away?  Hardly.

So, serious question here, in your estimation, what about the idea of combining Bitcoin mining with a laundry service, that is, wash and dry clothes, using the heat from the mining rigs.  Judging from your video, and from what I've read -- those rigs generate some serious heat.
People running laundromats are paying bucks to heat the water and run the dryers.  Hair salons, too: hot water and hot air in mass quantities...
Might as well earn some BTC while they're at it.
What do you think?  How much water could you heat to 105 or 110 degrees F using your mining rigs (estimation) ?  Thanks!

For example, back during the prior financial crisis, leading up to it...
We had "institutions with power and wealth" and they were selling "junk" investments to their customers, and the sellers knew it was junk because they turned around and promptly bet against those same customers, knowing that the junk they'd just purchased would soon blow up in the customers' faces.
I could go on and on all day about the atrocities committed by "institutions with power and wealth", before, during, and after the prior financial crisis.  They're all open for business (or will be Monday morning) if you think you'd like to do business with them.  Their system is rigged - and not in your favor.  Like George said, "It's a big club, but ain't in it..."
Every word he says is true.  Listen twice.
The Root Problem:  
We have a small group with the sole ability to create all the 'money' they want, from thin air, backed by nothing.  They created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play money" and have been using it to further enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.
Think about it.  If you and I could create trillions of dollars by merely typing numbers into our computers, don't you suppose we'd end up owning tons of real estate, a significant portion of the stock markets, resources, diamonds, yachts, private jets, country club memberships...  and: Mass Media Outlets to pump our propaganda and attack our enemies with... and: Politicians, so-called 'representatives', judges, regulators, law makers...  We couldn't lose.  If we made a bad bet, we'd just "print" more money and bail ourselves out again.  Right?  
Of course.
When those bankers create more money from thin air, through QE and/or zero percent interest rates (but only for their cronies), or negative interest rates -- they are stealing.
But there's a solution.
Bitcoin doesn't need those criminals to be involved.  Bitcoin is the solution to eventually undo those criminals -- make them have to play by the same rules as the rest of us have to play by.
Be patient.  Good things take time.
Here's what's going to eventually happen:
The entire global financial/banking system, based upon fiat currencies and fraud will implode and collapse.  When it does, it will happen quickly.  That ship will slip quickly into the icy waters.
Bitcoin is a different ship.  Good be on board the Bitcoin ship when that other piece of crap goes down.

How about debunking a few common myths about Bitcoin?
For example, some people have been told, and believe that it is a Ponzi scheme.  You might explain what a Ponzi actually IS, and articulate/explain how Bitcoin is different,and therefore not a Ponzi.
People say, "It isn't backed by anything." You could explain that it doesn't NEED to be backed by anything, that, like gold it backs itself.  Being "backed" by something means that you can trade in your "money" for that commodity the money is "backed by".

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all men are created equal**,   
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  
 that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  
— That  **to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving  their just powers from the** ***consent of the governed****,*  
— That whenever any  Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is **the Right of  the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government**,  laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in  such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and  Happiness.  
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long  established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and  accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to  suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by  abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  
But when a long train  of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a  design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, **it is their right, it  is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards  for their future security**.
*They are not better than we are.  They are not inherently superior.  We are not their subjects.  We are not their slaves.  We are not their property.  They answer to us, not the other way around.*

During the Cold War, there was Western Europe and there was Eastern Europe, divided by the "Iron Curtain".  I had a friend who was relatively new to my country.  Prior, he would help people cross from the East to the West, for a fee.  He got them across a certain river which had armed guards and spotlights on the Eastern side.  He'd tie inflated car inner tubes into a "train", one tube per person, then he'd swim, with fins, pulling a rope to pull the train to the other side, at night.  Everybody had to be very quiet, else the guards would shoot them.  
A lot of the punks today don't realize how bad things can get.  They have no idea how quickly they can get bad, or go from bad to worse.  They think, "I'll use a Bitcoin IRA because I'm too fucking lazy to hide a couple of pieces of paper in separate, secure locations," for example.  "My country isn't a third world shithole."  No, but it's quickly heading in that direction.  Anyhow... I digress...  
So, my friend was pulling a family across the river one night, and they got spotted, about half way across.  More and more lights.  He could hear the rifle shots.  He could hear the bullets splashing water near them.  What could he do?  Turn back and get shot anyhow?  No way.  He swam for his life, and the lives of an entire family, and they all made it.  He's a hero. 
He ended up in the US with nothing but the clothes on his back, and the knowledge in his head.  
Imagine if he had a Bitcoin seed phrase memorized in his head...  
He is one of many examples I'm personally aware of.

First, take a little time, start learning what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  
For example:  
Also, the book, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous is excellent.
Second, learn to stop and think, because there are a lot of scams related to Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency in general.  For instance, suppose I own a bunch of mining equipment and have an appropriate facility with enough cooling and enough cheap power to make mining profitable.  Do you think I'm going to sell "cloud mining" and let other people get rich, or do you suppose I might just mine the Bitcoins myself?  Think about it.
In my opinion, **the best thing you can do is what I've been doing: Buy and hold Bitcoin, long term.  Be patient.**  Never panic sell.  Never panic buy.  Don't try to time the market.  Don't ever sell, thinking you'll buy later at a lower price.  Don't invest money that you can't have "locked up" for a long time -- I'm talking years.  That's how you "get rich quick" in Bitcoin.  So far, the long-term ROI has been over 100 percent per year.  I see no reason for the long term average ROI to change.  Just be patient.

If anybody is dumb enough to trade their actual Bitcoin for an IOU, they're an idiot.  "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."  IOUs for Bitcoin are not Bitcoins.

\&gt;  does that mean I would have 5 different addresses (keys) for each bitcoin?
No.  Each public address can have less than one Bitcoin, say, 0.000032 BTC, for example, or it may have many, even thousands of BTC.
\&gt;  This is the key that I am supposed to never give anyone right?  
Bitcoin uses key-address pairs.  Each pair has a private key, and a public address.  The key and address are mathematically related.  To receive Bitcoin, you use your public address.  You must keep your private key a secret -- anybody who obtains your private key can take your Bitcoins.  
If you are storing your Bitcoin an exchange, then the exchange has the private key.  This is less than ideal.  Ideally, you want to keep your own private key or keys, rather than trust the exchange, for various reasons.  Wise people do not store significant amounts of Bitcoin on any exchange.
To send/spend Bitcoin, you need the private key.  You would also use a "wallet".  You would tell your wallet to create and broadcast a transaction, telling it how much BTC and where to send it.  The wallet would digitally sign the message by using the private key, proving that you own that BTC.  
Here's a really good introductory video:

Okay.  I laugh at people who think they can predict the future by looking at a squiggly line of the price vs. time for the last N days/weeks/months, AS IF the recent prices changes will be the CAUSE of future price changes.  Events cause changes in demand.  People wake up and have thoughts and feelings...  This is not some robot thing that has to follow some "formula".

The US government tried to ban alcohol... and failed.  
They tried to ban marijuana, and other "street" drugs... and failed.   
They fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan... and failed.  
Heck - they can't even balance a budget.  
Look at the failed response to the Katrina hurricane that devastated New Orleans -- fail.
They can't stop people from downloading free music, free movies, or porn...
They've been fighting a "war on poverty," since the 1960s... and they're still failing.
Then there's the so-called "war on terror".  If you've had to pass through an airport lately, you should notice that we've clearly lost that one.  More fail.

What we have now is a small group of people with the sole ability to create all the fiat money they want, from thin air, backed by nothing.  Old fashioned "money printing".
Over the last decade or so, that group has created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat "play money" by merely typing numbers into bank computers.  They have created no wealth, rather, they have transferred wealth unto themselves and their cronies in an unfair manner -- this amounts to theft.
The early Bitcoin investors were taking huge risks.  They did so because of the potential rewards.  If Bitcoin had failed, there would have been No Bailouts, unlike the aforementioned group.

I suggest that you don't understand how Bitcoin works.
Supply is relatively stable.  It increases, but slowly at a more-or-less fixed rate.
Demand goes up and down, and demand therefore drives prices.
Mining equipment does not drive the price.  If anything, Bitcoin's price drives mining equipment.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:27:41

TA (technical chart analysis) is bullshit.
Stop and think about it.  Supply and demand.  Bitcoin's supply is relatively fixed, and totally predictable.  Thus, Bitcoin's price is driven entirely by demand - changes in demand create changes in price.
***You cannot predict future demand by merely examining the recent price plotted vs time.  It doesn't follow some math formula.  Bitcoin's price is determined by human beings reacting to (mostly) unpredictable events happening around the world.***

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **137 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

On this ship, we see a bunch of fools running around, trading lifeboat "futures" for gambling chips in the ship's casino.  They seem to be doing well, for now, amassing piles of plastic chips.  
But then, there are the real, physical lifeboats.  
Knowing that the ship will eventually tilt, then slide into dark, icy waters many thousands of feet deep, you must decide if you want to play for imaginary lifeboats in the casino instead of obtaining an actual lifeboat.
Not your keys, not your lifeboat.

What do you mean by "paired with"?  
The price of Bitcoin would only reach 0 if everybody abandoned it -- and they would need some serious motivation to abandon it (like, it stopped working and couldn't be fixed).  
Unlike fiat money, EACH AND EVERY BITCOIN COSTS ENERGY/WORK TO PRODUCE.  Fiat money?  Somebody at the bank types in numbers, and, poof, another trillion units are created.  
Also, the number of Bitcoins is strictly limited.  There will never be more than 21 million BTC created.  So, it is scarce.  There is no limit to the amount of fiat that might be created, and history is full of examples of it being "printed" into oblivion, time after time.  Today's fiat currencies are no exception and are being "printed" into oblivion as we speak.

Look, man.  All a person needs to do is buy Bitcoin, then hold, long term.  That's it.  None of this "work your ass off," bullshit.  Just hold, long term.  
Why?  
Because the long term ROI for Bitcoin is around 100% per year, average.  
If doubling your money every year (long term average) isn't enough, you're mentally ill, or incredibly stupid.  
Don't day trade - each trade entails risk and cost (fees) which help cause you to eventually lose most/all of your investment.

"Gresham's Law" basically says that when there are two kinds of money in circulation, and one of them is better than the other, people will hold onto the stronger form of money and spend the weaker.  
For example, long ago, my aunt was a waitress in a nice restaurant. She saved her tips: pre-1965 silver coins. After 1965, she held those coins, long term and when she retired she spent the post-1965 bullshit coins first. Many years later, the silver coins were worth a lot of money, and she had a very comfortable retirement.
This is a real life example of Gresham's Law. When people have two kinds of money available to spend, they'll get rid of the crappy money and hold onto better money. In my aunt's case, smart people held the silver coins and spent the post 1965 crap.
Today, smart people hold Bitcoin long term and spend their fiat while there are still others willing to take it.

Bitcoin is the hardest form of money ever created.
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:57:26
Right now we have a small group with the ability to create all the fiat money they want, from thin air, by merely typing numbers into their bank computers.  They have created many trillions worth and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  They "print" money to "buy" politicians and judges and elections, and it doesn't cost them anything -- the costs are paid by the rest of us.  The corrupted politicians then pass laws to protect their "buddies" who own them.  
Inflation IS a form of wealth redistribution -- inflation is a form of theft.  
Bitcoin cleans that shit up.

The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance (PDF) on the tax treatment of transactions using virtual currencies, such as Bitcoins or other similar currencies.
The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability. This guidance applies to individuals and businesses that use virtual currencies.

Mining requires very specialized (and expensive) equipment, and lots of it.  The equipment generates a lot of heat (and noise) and must be cooled properly.  The mining equipment uses a lot of electrical power -- perhaps more than your home could handle without catching fire.  If you don't live someplace where it's really cold most of the time, your cooling equipment is going to consume a lot of electricity.  Electricity costs money.
If you live someplace with relatively cheap electrical power and it's really cold there most of the time (say, Siberia, parts of northern China, Iceland...) then you're going to have to compete against established miners who DO have access to cold climate and cheap power -- and they've been mining for years....
I can be done -- you could mine them yourself and make some money.  You're probably better off just buying and holding actual Bitcoin, long term, and enjoying the long-term average ROI from Bitcoin.  If you just buy and hold Bitcoin, you can start small, and gradually build up your holdings.  While you're doing that, continue to learn more and more about Bitcoin, about cyber security,  about "money", about the global economic system based upon fiat currencies...

It's worth learning to deal with stress, in the long run.  Yes, you can do it.  
Most stress is caused by having to make a decision when there are consequences.  
So, decide now that you're going to hold for 3 or 4 years.  Write it down on paper, then file the paper -- let the piece of paper "worry" about it.  Let the piece of paper check the price ever day, or every five minutes...  Seriously.  
Another tip: if you see the price and it makes you tense, take a deep breath, hold it for 5 seconds, then let it out (exhale) slowly while counting to 15... just relax.  Let go of the thought.  Everything is okay.  You can (and really should) relax.

What are the odds that you'll fall from a jet plane, then survive the landing in an ocean near the shore where you're immediately attacked by a shark while simultaneously being struck by lightning as a tsunami approaches, and it's your birthday....?
How would it be resolved?  Well, if a person created a new private key and an address, they'd probably notice right away, or at some point, that there is already BTC parked there.  They're going to  probably create another key-pair, then send the "free" coins to the second address.  Me?  I'd like to think that I'd just sit and stare at the screen for a long, long time, say, "I can't believe it... I can't believe it..." and then just toss out that private key because, really, I don't want to take somebody else's money --- I wouldn't want them to take mine.

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 137 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

Good. It was designed that way.  
Compare and contrast to the current global financial system where a small group has the sole ability to legally create all the money they want, from thin air, and then use it to greatly enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  This small group "just happens" to contain some of the richest people on the planet.  
When money is created from thin air, backed by nothing, it amounts to theft.  If you or I do it, say, by writing "bad checks" we go to jail for a long time, but these other people are allowed to legally create many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play money".

**Day Trading**
Day  traders (frequent traders, people who think they can time the market,  people who sell w/ intent to re-buy at a lower price) almost always end  up broke.  People who use leverage typically get liquidated in a hurry.
Each  trade entails risk.  Each trade entails cost.  Trades may also  complicate you tax paperwork.  Eventually the risks and costs win.
Meanwhile,  buying and holding for a long, long time has seen an extremely high  ROI, without much risk, without fees, without letting the "tax man" get  all into your business.
**Long term average ROI for Bitcoin is more than 100 percent per year.**  If that isn't enough for you, you're a stupid fool and you probably have significant mental illness.
Don't  let the people who sell books, courses, videos, software, coaching,  etc. trick you into thinking you can time the market -- you cannot.   Don't let the exchange owners trick you into spending a lot of money on  trading fees, with false hopes that you'll somehow be the rare "winner"  who doesn't lose all/most of his investment in a relatively short time.   There's no need for that kind of risk-taking; look at the high  long-term-average ROI of Bitcoin.
**Just buy and hold, long term.**

There will be real Bitcoins, on the blockchain, and then there will be some number of rehypothecated Bitcoins, that is, "paper Bitcoins".  
Eventually there will be a "bank run" where the first people to withdraw will get actual, real Bitcoin, and the others will have to accept USD, which might be worthless and undesirable at that point in time.  
There is a similar situation with gold, right now.  There is physical gold, and then, there are many (hundreds) of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical gold.

There   are certain kinds of things which should not be given as gifts, unless   they've been specifically requested.  For example, a puppy.  Suppose  you  don't particularly like dogs.  Suppose further that you travel a  lot,  and bringing a dog/puppy isn't an option, so you'd have to pay to  keep  the dog in a kennel.  Suppose further that your landlord either  does not  allow pets or charges $200 per month per pet.  But some  thoughtless  person gives you a puppy...
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
Owning   Bitcoin requires a bit of uncommon knowledge - public addresses,   private keys, wallets, exchanges, security, avoiding scams...  It   doesn't take much to fuck up and lose Bitcoin. Furthermore, believe it   or not, some people don't want Bitcoin.  Therefore, Bitcoin is a bad   gift idea, unless the recipient specifically requested it (or is already   an avid, active Bitcoin owner).

I should not have to read your entire blog CAREFULLY to get your point.  If I do, then you just failed as a writer.
Most people will only read your title.  Your title implies that Bitcoin is a Ponzi.
A few others, will skim your article quickly.  That's why good writers get to their point in the first paragraph, if not the first sentence.  They also repeat their main point.  Good writers do not bury their main point in the fine print.
Maybe you can fix it up, or rewrite it.  Remember: "What is my gold nugget?"  State your gold nugget as plainly as possible.  Then provide explanation, etc.  But reiterate your gold nugget (paraphrase, etc).  Ever notice how a lot of magazine articles have a quote  from the article in a "banner" in a large font?  A lot of times, that's all some people will read.
Don't try to tantalize/sensationalize with a misleading title or opening statement -- it just gives people the wrong impression.
Instead, know what your gold nugget is, then state it, and repeat it here and there.

Congratulations.  Seriously.  I've encountered probably over 100 people who claimed to understand Bitcoin, but didn't, and only two (including you) who actually did.  Please forgive my earlier rudeness.  
As you know, Bitcoin is a new kind of money.  So, it makes sense to ask, "Why do we need a new kind of money?"  Or, as you put it, what is Bitcoin for?  
One problem with existing money, fiat currency, is that it isn't backed by anything tangible.  I would say it's just ink on rags, or "notes", but it turns out that most money in the world today (roughly 90%) exists only as digits in centralized bank databases.  Since fiat isn't backed by gold, silver, or anything else, there is nothing to stop the central bankers from creating huge amounts of it -- by merely typing numbers into their computers.  In fact, since about 2008, central banks around the world have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat money -- and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies, at a cost.  That cost is ultimately paid by the rest of us.  
There is money, and then there is actual wealth.  You can't create wealth by merely creating more fiat money.  When large amounts of fiat money is created, it actually transfers wealth from the many unto a few.  Basically, the already ultra-rich central bankers and their cronies get to "rob" everybody else - even poor people.  
Look up "cantilon effect".  
Eventually, every fiat currency goes to zero value.  Along the way, hyperinflation, misery, suffering for the masses, but not for the people who cause it to happen.  
Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currencies.  
Another problem with current currencies is that they are being used as a "weapon" via sanctions.  Individuals and even entire countries are finding themselves suddenly "locked out" of the global financial system because they didn't suck up to the right superpower.  In China, for example, they're giving people "social scores" and if your score is too low (say, you spoke out against an unfair government policy), they literally restrict what, where, and when you're able to spend money.  Yes, it can happen where you live, too, eventually.  
Bitcoin offers an alternative.  
Bitcoin can provide a layer of privacy protection, too.  Right now, every time you spend fiat money that isn't cash, there is a record of it.  Someday, that record could be used against people.  
Bitcoin provides a way to store wealth, where it cannot be confiscated, hyperinflated to nothing, or restricted by tyrannical governments.  
Bitcoin, having the same properties that make gold valuable, is "gold" which can be inexpensively and securely stored and transported across the globe, almost instantly.

Just for fun, lets' do the math:

\[EDIT: MATH ERROR: I should have writtin 820,000 percent.. nearly one million percent per year...  Sorry for any confusion or broken homes this may have caused.\]
Think about it... they can earn 2.5% per day, or 8000+ percent per year, but they NEED YOUR MONEY?  I can tell you that if I could make money that fast, the last thing I'd need to do is go around contacting strangers, hitting them up for money.

More like this...
Somebody opens a "bitcoin bank" (I'll just call it the "bank").  From deposits, or from the bankers, or their backers... some actual Bitcoin is owned.  
The Bitcoin then gets distributed into a shitload of public addresses.  Could be one address per Bitcoin-backed note, or one address per BTC, or  whatever.  
Then, counterfeit-resistant Bitcoin-backed notes are created, and denominated in satoshis, say, 100,000 sats, 500,000, 1 million...  Each note has a unique and non sequential ID.  Each note is associated with specific satoshis in a specific address, and the associations are publicly readable.  
Somehow, the notes get distributed... to depositors?  Whatever.  The notes can be freely traded, like existing cash -- except, a person with a smartphone (and/or a cash register) would be able to scan, then look up the ID of every note accepted as payment -- make sure it's a real ID which is still in use.  
Remember, the actual BTC still exists on the Bitcoin blockchain.  When a person goes to the "bank" and presents a valid note, and their public address, the amount of BTC associated with that note (and printed thereupon) gets sent to their wallet, same as it does now -- via a transaction which gets included into a block with confirmations.  
If you're selling sandwiches for 100K satoshis and I give you a note with 100K satoshis printed on it, and you quickly scan the note's ID and it's good, then nobody needed any private keys for our transaction.  No transaction took up space in the blockchain.  
Large amount transactions should still go through the blockchain, but for sandwiches, cups of coffee, bags of groceries, cab fares, etc. the minimal risk of getting "ripped off" by a counterfeiter would be minimal and (I believe) acceptable.  Right?  You want to buy a $435,000 car?  Better do a conventional wallet-to-wallet spend transaction and wait for some confirmations.  Want a beer at the ballgame?  Flip the man a couple of 100K satoshi notes.

 The War Against Cash  
However, the more pertinent narrative seems to be that governments  are trying to limit cash usage in order to maintain control over money  and how its citizens are allowed to use it. Cash is the ultimate form of  private money – anyone can use it in a direct and simple transaction,  without it being traced or restricted.  
With an ever-increasing limitation on cash, people will be basically  forced to hold and use the digital form of money, which is generally  held at banks, fintech and payments companies. In a world where every  transaction must be electronic and traceable, the influence of big  banks, corporations, tech firms, and governments over the flow of money  will be unlimited.

When I look at the historical "track record" of fiat currencies I see fiat money always fails, always goes to zero.  
When I look at today's global financial system, built upon fiat currencies, I see a system in its final stage, I see it beginning to collapse.  For example, "QE", debt monetization, excessive "money printing".  **For example, negative interest rates.**  
When I look at today's global financial system, I see money being used unfairly by evil entities to spy upon, control, and rob ordinary, hard working citizens, I see money being used as a **weapon**, I see sanctions and tariffs.  I also see revolt.  
I see the current global financial system for what it is: a big pile of poo, the biggest scam of all time, ever.  I also see it failing before my very eyes.  
**Note:**  I saw most of this ***before Bitcoin existed.***  So, let's be clear, the current, fiat-money banking system will fail because of its inherent flaws - with or without Bitcoin.  Meanwhile, **Bitcoin gives people a choice, an honest and fair alternative.**

We  have a small group with the sole ability to "legally counterfeit" all  the money they choose, and then use that money to enrich and empower  themselves and their cronies.  But there is a cost.
$500 Billion buys a lot of stuff.  Ultimately, somebody has to pay for that $500 Billion because **the  central bank cannot create actual wealth by "printing" money -- but  they can, and do transfer $500 Billion of actual wealth from the rest of  us unto themselves and their cronies**.
This is a form of theft.
We - you and I - are being robbed, again.
$500  Billion is a lot of money.  It is five hundred times one thousand times one million  dollars.  If there are two taxpayers in your home, your share is more  than $7,200.  You earned that money, they did not.
One  or more of the Federal Reserve's cronies borrowed money, made stupid  bets with it, then lost those bets.  They deserve to fail.  They deserve  to go bankrupt and be liquidated.  It is best for us all that they and  their stakeholders go out of business and lose their jobs and their  fancy mansions and their yachts and diamonds and fur coats...  That  would be fair; that would be healing for the entire economy, in the long  term.  But that's not what will happen.
Those  fools are being bailed out, again.  We are paying for their bad bets  whether we want to or not.  We don't get to vote on it.  We don't get to  vote the Fed FOMC members out of office.  Those idiots will be made  whole again at our expense, and they'll get gigantic bonuses again.   Then they'll go out an make more bad bets, knowing that **if they win, they get to keep it, but when they lose, we have to pay**.

Bitcoin was $3.50 - three dollars and fifty cents - on Dec 12, 2011, for example.  Now it's worth $7,200...  It hasn't been a "national currency" during those 8 or 10 years -- but it works and it keeps growing.  
Eventually, there will be a "good enough" 2nd layer to scale, and then we'll see what little "smarty pants" people like Cuban have to say.  I'm sure they'll come up with something just as stupid.

Give somebody their first Bitcoin.  They'll need a wallet.  They'll need to install a good wallet and not get scammed into installing a scam wallet.  They'll need to generate a seed phrase, then write it down, twice, without fucking up.  Then they can generate a public address and have the Bitcoin sent to it, so they can own it.  They'll need to understand seed phrases and private keys and public addresses.  They'll need to have some idea of what Bitcoin actually is.  Then they'll need to be smart enough not to fall for any scams - and there are plenty.  One day, when they want to use their Bitcoin to buy something, say, 4 months later, they'll need to open an account on an exchange and be humiliated by the KYC/AML bullshit... and then send their BTC to the exchange without fucking up, then the waiting periods, etc. etc... and then they'll have cash and they can go to the nursery and buy those new rose bushes (or whatever).
Or, give them cash or a gift card.  They wait 4 months, then go to the nursery and buy rose bushes, from you.

If you need a decentralized, immutable ledger, use Blockchain.  
Otherwise, use some other database technology (RDBMS, no-sql, etc.)

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

There  are certain kinds of things which should not be given as gifts, unless  they've been specifically requested.  For example, a puppy.  Suppose you  don't particularly like dogs.  Suppose further that you travel a lot,  and bringing a dog/puppy isn't an option, so you'd have to pay to keep  the dog in a kennel.  Suppose further that your landlord either does not  allow pets or charges $200 per month per pet.  But some thoughtless  person gives you a puppy...
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
Owning  Bitcoin requires a bit of uncommon knowledge - public addresses,  private keys, wallets, exchanges, security, avoiding scams...  It  doesn't take much to fuck up and lose Bitcoin. Furthermore, believe it  or not, some people don't want Bitcoin.  Therefore, Bitcoin is a bad  gift idea, unless the recipient specifically requested it (or is already  an avid, active Bitcoin owner).

Suppose that a Bitcoin-backed bill/note could be taken someplace (convenient) and redeemed for actual Bitcoin sent to the owner's wallet.  Suppose that once a note has been redeemed, that it's ID is instantly recorded in a publicly readable database/list - by ID.  Suppose that when somebody receives a Bitcoin-backed note that they can look up the ID to determine that it has a valid ID and that no note with that ID has been redeemed yet.  This might not eliminate counterfeits, but it would make it more difficult and less rewarding.  
For example, there could be a 256 bit ID, or 1024 bits.  Good luck at "guessing" a valid ID, since they would not be created sequentially.  If, on the other hand the counterfeiter used a known ID, he'd only be able to pass off a few before that ID would become a known "bad" id, such that few people would accept it.  It might also help to come up with a system such that the Bitcoin-backed notes were frequently "rotated," that is, old notes taken out of circulation and replaced with fresh notes using never-before-used IDs... 
Right now, the central banks "counterfeit" trillions of units of currency, backed by nothing -- and people are happy to use them.  I think people would be just as willing to use a slightly less than perfect Bitcoin-backed note.

TA is based upon bullshit. I'm serious. It goes back to before Bitcoin, before the Internet and eTrade... there were "stock brokers" who used land-line telephones to generate "churn".
You see, those stock brokers were just salesmen, and they only got paid by commission, so they only got paid whenever they could convince somebody else to make a trade. When people just buy and hold long term, the salesmen go hungry.
So, they crafted this bullshit and gave it a scientific/engineering sounding name, "technical analysis." They drew lines on charts and threw jargon around to give the customer the impression that the salesman had asymmetric information and could help the customer get rich. But it was all pure bullshit.
It has subtle variants, such as "rebalancing". Still, the ultimate objective: get someone to agree to make a trade, then get a commission. It's not based upon anything other than that. It's bullshit, whether you can admit it or not.
Think about it: if the salesman did have special information, and/or special techniques which worked often enough, why would they be spending all day making cold calls for chump change? They would merely apply their knowledge and/or technique and become fabulously rich. BUT THEY DIDN'T.

Gold is expensive to store securely.  
Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.  
Gold is heavy, it takes up space, it sets off metal detectors.  You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold.  You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.  
Gold can be confiscated.  Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.  Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.  
Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold.  There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation.  It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.  
Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.  
Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.  
Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.  Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.  Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

# Has Bitcoin been an awesome idea from the start? Yes.
Does Bitcoin work?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin secure?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin scarce?  Yes.
Does Bitcoin continue to improve?  Yes.
Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time?  No.
Is Bitcoin's price volatile?  Yes.
Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners?  No.
Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works?  No.
Do many people understand fiat money?  Fractional reserve banking?  Central banking?  No.
Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies?  Yes.
Is fiat money backed by anything?  No, not since 1971.
Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers?  Yes, by the trillions.
Is excessive "money printing" a form of theft?  Yes.
Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero?  Yes.
What about today's fiat currencies?  They are well on their ways to zero.
Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago?  Yes.
Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis?  No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.
Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9.  No.  In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.
Are  banker bailouts still happening?  Apparently: recent Fed repo  activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity  is insolvent.  Stay tuned.
Is the  economy doing well?  For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes.  For the  rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.
Are there asset bubbles due to central bank activities?  Yes, in stocks, bonds, real estate, fine art, etc.
Do asset bubbles always pop?  Yes.
Is there negative interest rate debt?  Yes.  Many trillions, and growing.
In all recorded history, have there ever been negative interest rates?  No, not until very recently.
Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal.  Yes.
Is  Bitcoin better than fiat money?  For getting paid and buying groceries,  not yet.   For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.
Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin better than bonds?  Yes.
Is  Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate?  Until the  current bubbles pop, certainly.  For all time?  Yes, because real estate  has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real  estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.
Is Bitcoin better than gold?  In many ways, yes.  Overall, for sure.
Should  people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change  in price?  That's not for me to decide.  Still, I learned a long time  ago not to panic.
Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past?  Yes, both up and down.
What is Bitcoin's long-term ROI?  More than 100% per year, on average.
Is there any reason to believe the long-term ROI trend will continue?  Read this post again, from the top...

First, let's clear up your misunderstanding of gold.  
Gold is valuable and a good, strong form of money for the following reasons:  
Gold is durable, divisible, portable, recognizable, fungible, scarce, difficult to counterfeit, expensive to produce.
Gold's aesthetic value is about on par with aluminum foil.  Similarly, if not for it's scarcity gold's industrial value would be on par with aluminum, copper, zinc, etc.  
Let's be extra clear about this: Gold is prized because it has all the properties necessary to be a "good" form of money.  Whoever told you otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.  
Meanwhile, Bitcoin has all of those same properties that make gold valuable and a good form of money:
* Durable
* Divisible
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* Portable
* Scarce
* Difficult/impossible to counterfeit
* Expensive/difficult to produce
In addition to those properties, Bitcoin has other properties which make it even better than gold:
* Inexpensive and easy to store securely
* Inexpensive, fast, and easy to transport
* Cannot be confiscated
* Does not set off metal detectors
* Takes up no space, weighs nothing
* Can be sent via the Internet

Bitcoins can't be stored on a thumb drive.  
They exist in the Bitcoin blockchain, and get sent from public address to public address.  
You might store a copy of the blockchain on a thumb drive, given it has enough capacity, but after a short while, there will be transactions and blocks that don't exist in your old copy.

There are certain kinds of things which should not be given as gifts, unless they've been specifically requested.  For example, a puppy.  Suppose you don't particularly like dogs.  Suppose further that you travel a lot, and bringing a dog/puppy isn't an option, so you'd have to pay to keep the dog in a kennel.  Suppose further that your landlord either does not allow pets or charges $200 per month per pet.  But some thoughtless person gives you a puppy...  
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?  
Owning Bitcoin requires a bit of uncommon knowledge - public addresses, private keys, wallets, exchanges, security, avoiding scams...  It doesn't take much to fuck up and lose Bitcoin. Furthermore, believe it or not, some people don't want Bitcoin.  Therefore, Bitcoin is a bad gift idea, unless the recipient specifically requested it (or is already an avid, active Bitcoin owner).

Right now, most money in the world is already "digital," that is, it only exists as digits in some centralized computer database.  About 90 percent of all USD, Euro, YEN, etc. exists only in "digital" format (as opposed to printed notes).  
You came here and posted some bullshit about some shitcoin proposed by FB.  Facebook sucks.  Their "money" will suck, too, if it ever comes into existence, whether it's "digital" or not.  
I recommend that you learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  Yes, Bitcoin is purely digital, but that is not what makes it special.  Here are good places to start:  
An excellent book, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:47:27
You have a lot to learn.
There are (and have been) different kinds of money.
One type of money is token-based: coins, bills, banknotes, glass beads, gigantic rocks with a hole in the center...
Another type of money is **ledger-**based: checking accounts, bank accounts, credit cards, bar tabs, etc.
Bitcoin is a ledger.  The ledger is stored on something called a Blockchain, which makes the ledger immutable, secure, tamper-proof, while at the same time preventing double-spending, all without the need for a third-party central authority.
The stuff you're used to using for money is called "fiat currency" and it's about to die.  So, learn about Bitcoin before it's too late for you.

Do the math.  If your employer matches your 401K, it's likely to be a good deal.  Otherwise, it's not.  
Here's why: the premise is to lock up your money to ultimately pay less tax.  The assumption is that you're earning a lot of money now, and you'll be in a lower tax bracket after you retire.  Ah, but if you retire right, you'll still be in the same tax bracket.  
Another assumption is that the government won't raise taxes in the meantime. 
Still, if the employer matches (and there isn't a long vesting period), take advantage of it, put money into 401K.  If not, maybe just put a little in, because it does add up over time, and nobody ever says, "Gee, I wish I hadn't saved up all this money..."  But don't think you're getting some significant tax advantage unless you've worked the math out for yourself and are aware of any assumptions you're making about what might/might not happen in the meanwhile.  
Do some SOMETHING for retirement.  YES!

Not correct.  About 90 percent of all money in the world (USD, Yen, Euro, etc.),   has been digital for a long, long time -- since before Bitcoin.  That is most fiat money only exists as numbers in centrally controlled bank databases.










"Blockchain" and "spreadsheet" are jargon.  So is "mining protocol," etc.
Each block has MANY possible solutions, not just one.  The miners find a number, not an equation, to prove they did the work.  Again, you delve into technical details, and jargon.

Has Bitcoin been an awesome idea from the start? Yes.
Does Bitcoin work?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin secure?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin scarce?  Yes.
Does Bitcoin continue to improve?  Yes.
Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time?  No.
Is Bitcoin's price volatile?  Yes.
Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners?  No.
Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works?  No.
Do many people understand fiat money?  Fractional reserve banking?  Central banking?  No.
Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies?  Yes.
Is fiat money backed by anything?  No, not since 1971.
Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers?  Yes, by the trillions.
Is excessive "money printing" a form of theft?  Yes.
Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero?  Yes.
What about today's fiat currencies?  They are well on their ways to zero.
Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago?  Yes.
Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis?  No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.
Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9.  No.  In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.
Are  banker bailouts still happening?  Apparently: recent Fed repo  activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity  is insolvent.  Stay tuned.
Is the  economy doing well?  For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes.  For the  rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks?  Yes.
Is Bitcoin better than bonds?  Yes.
Is  Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate?  Until the  current bubbles pop, certainly.  For all time?  Yes, because real estate  has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real  estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.
Is Bitcoin better than gold?  In many ways, yes.  Overall, for sure.
Should  people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change  in price?  That's not for me to decide.  Still, I learned a long time  ago not to panic.
Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past?  Yes, both up and down.
What is Bitcoin's long-term ROI?  More than 100% per year, on average.
Is there any reason to believe the long-term ROI trend will continue?  Read this post again, from the top...

I look at it this way: Compare the following amounts of electrical power to each other:
* consumed by Bitcoin mining
* all electrical power consumed, globally
What you'll find is that Bitcoin is just a drop in a bucket.
Or, if you take two reams of computer printer paper, 500 sheets each, and that represents all electrical power consumed, Bitcoin mining makes up about one sheet.  One sheet out of a 3 or 4 inch stack.
IF you, or anybody else is concerned about the environment:
* That's really nice.  Thank you for your concern.
* Go after some of the other 999 sheets
* Have a nice day

Actually, if you ever venture over to the "economics" subreddit, for example, you'll encounter a bunch of Keynesian "economists".  They turn out to be amazingly clueless about money.  They're not inherently stupid, typically the opposite.  They've been systematically deprived of ever learning the very basics of what money is, it's various forms, what makes one form of money better than another.  They end up brainwashed to literally worship "money printing" central bankers.  They've been brainwashed to believe that creating more money is the solution to every imaginable financial problem faced by society.

Word to the wise:  
I've known millionaires and even some billionaires.  One of the most miserable people I've ever met was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some of the most joyful people I've met were actually kind of poor -- but they were happy, and thankful.  I've also known happy rich people and miserable poor people.  
If you're not happy now, becoming rich won't make you happy.  Gaining wealth tends to just amplify your existing state of mind.  If you learn to be happy with what you have, and if you learn to be thankful for everything, then gaining wealth will amplify those good qualities.  
While waiting for Bitcoin to "moon," use the time to learn to genuinely enjoy life -- even the simplest, ordinary things.  Learn to be thankful in ALL situations, even when things aren't going your way or you seem to be having bad luck -- be thankful anyhow.  
Meanwhile:  
You won't get ahead by doing what almost everybody else is doing.  
You won't get ahead by merely doing what your parents (or grandparents) did.  
You won't get ahead without a plan.  You won't get ahead unless you're flexible, and change your plans, as necessary.  
You won't get ahead by paying somebody else to "manage" your wealth/finances.  
What IS "getting ahead" anyhow?  "Ahead" implies a relative position - ahead or behind something/someone else.  Comparisons might be objective, but they're often subjective.  Like I mentioned, things are not always what they seem.  For example, you see somebody driving a nice car or living in a nice home, but you don't see their mountain of debts, you don't see their unfaithful partner, you don't see their internal misery.  A lot of people use debt to "pretend" they're rich, for a while.  You might see a guy in old clothes shopping at the dollar store and not realize he's a millionaire and he's a very happy person in general, and he was happy way back when he was broke...  
I've known so many people who go through their life thinking, "If I could just have THIS, then I'll be happy..."  I've seen some of them get that thing, but then they weren't happy.  No.  They just changed the "THIS" to some other object.  Example: they get a decent car but now they need a house... they get a house but they're still a miserable piece of shit.   I don't want that to happen to you.  You don't want that to happen to you.  
When most people want to be "rich" they really want to be happy, to have less stress, to feel secure.  Happiness comes from the inside, not by obtaining "things" on the outside.  What makes me happy?  I make me happy.  You make you happy.  
If you're already in the habit of being happy, and then you find yourself fabulously rich, then you'll be that much happier.  But if you're not happy -- acquiring great wealth is just going to make you a miserable person.

# Why quantum computers do not pose a risk to bitcoin. (The quantum fud campaign has worked in the past and it worked this time. People need to learn to rebuke this false narrative)
**The claim:** Quantum computers can hack bitcoin and its right around the corner.
There is no known way that quantum computers can break SHA256 (only the signing elliptic curve/ECDSA). So **cold wallets will always be safe** (this means you have not made an outgoing transaction in that wallet)
**This also means you will always be safe in actively making transactions** as long as wallet providers upgrade the functionality to constantly move your funds to a new address on each transaction (this already exists in several wallets). Its a simple software update.
There is a larger discussion on upgrading bitcoin, the fact that quantum computers are not even close to being able to crack ECDSA, etc. But I'm just going to leave it at what I said above. **Your Bitcoin is not at risk from quantum computing.**

When you invest in stocks, do they send you the paper stock certificates?  No.  Somebody else holds those for you.  The government could confiscate it from you, for example.  You also have to trust that people aren't rehypothecating stocks.  
When you put Bitcoin in your wallet, you and you alone have the private key.  Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin.  You know that your Bitcoin has not been rehypothecated.

After 1965, she held those coins, long term and  when she retired she spent the post-1965 bullshit coins first.  Many years later, the silver coins were worth a lot of money, and she had a very comfortable retirement.
This is a real life example of Gresham's Law.  When people have two kinds of money available to spend, they'll get rid of the crappy money and hold onto better money.  In my aunt's case, smart people held the silver coins and spent the post 1965 crap.

SEC?  
Where was the SEC in the late 1990s, when companies that didn't even have a product, nor customers, nor even one dollar of revenue were going public?  
Where was the SEC in 2006/7 when things like "collateralized debt obligations" and other toxic crap was being sold by Too Big To Fail criminals?  They packaged up mortgages which weren't being paid, had the packaged product "rated" as top notch, sold the crap to unsuspecting customers, and then some of the banks placed large bets AGAINST their own customers.  
SEC to the rescue?  Really??  
Did any criminal bankers go to jail as a result of 2008/9?  No.
I can't see why any reasonable person would have faith in the SEC...

They will first collect personal **identity** information, with which they can **steal you very identity.**  (Remember, you can get a new credit card, but you cannot get a new identity.)  Naturally, they will claim that they need a copy of your drivers license, etc. ... but **don't do it**.  
Second, they will tell you that you need to send them some amount of Bitcoin... claiming that they need to know you're not a robot or something similar -- **don't do it.**  
Yeah, it's nice to think/feel like YOU have been chosen at random for a prize, but you haven't.  Remember those email scams, "I'm a Nigerian prince, I will split my fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars if you let me use your bank account..." scams?  This is just a variation on that.   **Don't be stupid.**  People don't go around just handing out money to random strangers for no reason.

Was Bitcoin an awesome idea from the start? Yes.  
Have people been predicting/announcing Bitcoin's death since its beginning?  Yes.  
How many of them were correct?  Zero.  
Does Bitcoin work?  Yes.  
Is Bitcoin secure?  Yes.  
Is Bitcoin scarce?  Yes.  
Does Bitcoin continue to improve?  Yes.  
Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time?  No.  
Is Bitcoin's price volatile?  Yes.  
Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners?  No.  
Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works?  No.  
Do many people understand fiat money?  Fractional reserve banking?  Central banking?  No.  
Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies?  Yes.  
Is fiat money backed by anything?  No, not since 1971.  
Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers?  Yes, by the trillions.  
Is excessive "money printing" a form of theft?  Yes.  
Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero?  Yes.  
What about today's fiat currencies?  They are well on their ways to zero.  
Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago?  Yes.  
Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis?  No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.  
Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9.  No.  In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.  
Are  banker bailouts still happening?  Apparently: recent Fed repo  activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity  is insolvent.  Stay tuned.  
Is the  economy doing well?  For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes.  For the  rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.  
Are there asset bubbles due to central bank activities?  Yes, in stocks, bonds, real estate, fine art, etc.  
Do asset bubbles always pop?  Yes.  
Is there negative interest rate debt?  Yes.  Many trillions, and growing.  
In all recorded history, have there ever been negative interest rates?  No, not until very recently.   
Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal.  Yes.  
Is  Bitcoin better than fiat money?  For getting paid and buying groceries,  not yet.   For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.  
Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks?  Yes.  
Is Bitcoin better than bonds?  Yes.  
Is  Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate?  Until the  current bubbles pop, certainly.  For all time?  Yes, because real estate  has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real  estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.  
Is Bitcoin better than gold?  In many ways, yes.  Overall, for sure.  
Should  people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change  in price?  That's not for me to decide.  Still, I learned a long time  ago not to panic.  
Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past?  Yes, both up and down.  
What is Bitcoin's long-term ROI?  More than 100% per year, on average.

@_date: 2019-12-13 00:13:36
In a fractional reserve lending system, like in the US, money is created when loans are made by a bank, and money is destroyed when such loans are repaid or defaulted upon.  
So, a lot of debt would be wiped out - and debt is the bankers' "assets" (not kidding, look it up).  This would be deflationary.
Deflation would wipe out a lot of banking criminals.

Don't day trade.  
Don't borrow money to buy Bitcoin.  
Don't buy Bitcoin with money you can't afford to either lose or have "tied up" for a few years (if necessary).  
Don't store your Bitcoin on any exchange or any on-line wallet.  
"Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."  If you don't appreciate what that means, find out before investing/owning any amount of Bitcoin worth more than a few dollars.  
Realize that you cannot time the market.  Realize that "TA" is bullshit.  Realize that most frequent/day traders end up losing big.  
Buy and hold, long term.  Be patient.  Don't panic, no matter what the price does.  Consider dollar-cost-averaging.  
Learn what Bitcoin actually is and the basics of how it works so you'll be more immune to FUD and other bullshit.

No.  Good question, though.  
The exchange has their private key and public address.  
You would have your private key and public address, different from the exchange's.  You would have the exchange send it to your own public address.  At that point, the exchange knows your public address, but not your private key.  Your trezor would know your private key, in case you want to send some/all of your BTC to another address.

But money is just a general purpose IOU.  
Cash, that is, bank notes even say they're for all DEBTS, public and private.
In a fractional reserve system, some money is created, from thin air, backed by nothing, when loans are made by banks.  However, money is destroyed and goes back into thin air when bank loans are paid off.  
Meanwhile, we have central banks around the world who have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat currencies by merely typing numbers into their computers.  When they do that, they are stealing from other people in order to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  Stealing is wrong, bad, evil, despicable, weak, inferior...  
Anyhow, banks DO create money and lots of it, and the money they create is not backed by anything.

You're trying to solve a problem that does not exist; you're starting with a false premise.  
Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **137 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

When you learn how money actually works, you'll be able to see plainly how inflation is theft.  
Inflation is quite low?  Only if you use a very warped, dishonest, and foolish "measurement" of inflation.  To say inflation is low you have to ignore the cost of keeping a roof over your head (real estate, rents), the cost of medical care, the cost of saving for retirement (stocks), bonds, fine art, etc.  You either did not know that, or you know it but you're some kind of creepy liar, so I gave you the benefit of the doubt and figured you just lack understanding.

Gold is relatively heavy, and takes up space.  Gold sets off metal detectors.  People hide tungsten inside gold bars/coins.  Gold is expensive to securely store and/or transport.  Gold can be, and has been confiscated by government.  
Bitcoin has no weight, takes up no space.  Memorized private keys cannot be detected, nor confiscated.  Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited.  Bitcoin is inexpensive to securely store and/or transmit.

Actually, real money, like gold, silver, and Bitcoin doesn't need backing.  Paper notes should be backed by real money, but since 1971 they are not.  
When somebody says, "What backs Bitcoin?" I instantly answer with, "What backs gold?"  That throws off nearly 100% of the naysayers, because they don't know shit about money.  One time, though, it was an honest question.  I got to explain how gold has certain properties that make it a form of "strong" money, and then explain that Bitcoin has all those same properties.

You've got a really good point.  
It's like, I sometimes buy ONE lottery ticket, when the jackpot is astronomical, because I can't win if I don't bet.  The way I see it, buying one lottery ticket per drawing is a good deal -- not because of the odds, no, rather because you can buy **hope** for a dollar per week.  
Hope, for a dollar, is a good deal.
If a person has some shitty-ass job and money problems, for just one dollar per week, they get to go around thinking things like, "If I win the lottery, I can tell my boss to fuck off, and then buy a big house and nice cars... then travel and see the world, first class."  But not if they don't buy that ticket.
It would be nice to have a mining program which runs on a PC/Mac/Pi/Linux...smart phone, whatever, which takes one or two guesses per block, (or, every ten minutes) without consuming a lot of power.  Getting lucky wouldn't change your life like winning a huge lottery jackpot, but it sure would help most people I know.

Buy a small amount of BTC.  Do not borrow to buy BTC.  Do not invest money which you cannot afford to have "locked up" for a "long time" or to lose completely.  
Be a patient investor - just hold and hold.  
In the meanwhile, start learning what Bitcoin is, that is, learn the very basics of how it works.

Bitcoin, like gold, has all the properties of "sound" (good) money:
* Divisible
* Durable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* Portable
* Scarce/rare
* Difficult/impossible to counterfeit
Most USD, for example, exists only in digital form -- that fact hasn't bothered many people.  For some reason that's supposed to be a big downer for Bitcoin, though.  FUD.

Before explaining mining, you should cover some background. (See below.)  After that, mining is this:
1. Collect a bunch of pending transactions
2. Add a "nonce" (the miner takes a wild guess)
3. Compute the hash( ) of the transactions + nonce + hash of previous block
4. Is the hash( ) value small enough?  Yes - you just mined Bitcoin.  No?  Guess again, go to step 3.
# For Beginners and Other Curious Creatures: A Gentle Introduction To Bitcoin
**What is Bitcoin?  It is a new kind of money.**   Actually, it's just an old kind of money you're already familiar with,  but with certain improvements.  It turns out this new, improved money  has some very important properties which make Bitcoin one of the most  important inventions of all time.
At it's heart, **Bitcoin is a ledger --**  a list of transactions.  That's it.  A transaction is an event where a  person sends 'money' from one 'account' to another.  The transactions  are stored in the order in which they occurred.  The ledger is stored on  computers.
If you've ever used a  check (a paycheck, for example), or a credit card you've already used  'money' in the form of a ledger stored on computers.
So, **what makes Bitcoin different?**   Bitcoin's ledger is stored on many thousands of computers, spread  across the globe.  Anybody is free to participate.  The computers all  use the same set of 'rules' to keep the Bitcoin ledger honest, fair, and  accurate.  The rules also specify precisely how, and how much new  'money' is to be created and to whom it will belong upon its creation.   With checks and credit cards, the ledgers are kept in a relatively small  number of computers owned and operated by banks.
**Bitcoin 'money' is very, very difficult and expensive to create.**  The number of Bitcoins is strictly limited -- **there will never be more than 21 million**  Bitcoins created.  Many have already been lost forever.  This makes  each and every Bitcoin rare, and precious -- like gold, only better.   Bank ledgers keep track of fiat money.  **Fiat money is created from thin air, by merely typing numbers into a bank computer**;  fiat money is not backed by gold or anything else; fiat money is even  less precious than "play money" you'd find in the toy aisle of the  dollar store.  Fiat money loses value over time as the banking system  creates more and more of it.  Bitcoin gains value over time because  demand rises (as more people understand its goodness) while the supply  is strictly limited.
**Newly created Bitcoin money goes, as a reward, to people who earned it** by protecting the Bitcoin ledger (enforcing its rules, for example).  This is fair, honest, and good.  **Newly created fiat money goes to bankers and then to their cronies.**   That's right: we have a very small group of people with the ability to  create 'money' from nothing and then use it to enrich and empower  themselves and their cronies **at the expense of everybody else**,  including (but not limited to) elderly blind widows.  It turns out that  creating fiat money and using it (to buy things, to bail our broke  banks and businesses, to bribe politicians) amounts to theft.
Fiat money is inherently flawed, dishonest, unfair, bad...
**Bitcoin is honest, fair, and good.**
Furthermore,  the banks can and will cut people off from being able to use their  ledgers/fiat-money system when a government tells them to do so.  This  has already happened to whistle blowers, dissidents, and even entire  nations.  Fiat money is not only used to rob ordinary people, it is also  used as a 'weapon'.  Bitcoin is open to everybody.  Bitcoin cannot be  coerced to "sanction" people (whether they deserve it or not).  In  short, fiat money supports violence and theft whereas Bitcoin promotes  harmony, peace, and fairness via "sound money".

For example, I have found a technique to spin straw into gold.  I buy the straw for cheap, and sell the gold thread, on spools, by the ounce.  It's pure gold so I get about $1400 per spool (one ounce of gold).  
Instead of just spinning gold, you can send me money, and I'll spin gold, sell it, then send you the profit.  Okay?  
If you believe me, you need some serious help.  But the fact is, that's the kind of scam "cloud mining" is.  And you're falling for that.

Do you have any debt?  What kind?  How much?  
Do you have an emergency cash cushion saved?  Enough to pay all your bills for a full year?  Two years?  
Do you have any other investments?  
Basically, if you're out of debt (except maybe a mortgage) and have an emergency cushion, then put a big chunk of what's left into Bitcoin provided you know you won't need that money for the next 3 years or so.  This is a long term, buy and hold kind of thing -- but it has been very lucrative for patient investors with "strong hands".

A good place to start is the first seven chapters of, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.

Without appreciating those things, you're not likely for fully grasp the awesomeness of Bitcoin.

Yes, it is worth investing in.  
Do you have debts?  If so, what kind(s)?  How much?  Typically, pay off your debt(s), first, with the possible exception of a mortgage for the home you live in.  
Do you have an emergency cash cushion saved?  Enough to pay all your bills for a full year?  Two years?  
Do you have (separate from emergency funds) "investment money" to invest?  Money you know you won't need during the next three to five years?  
Bitcoin is volatile.  It can fall in price after you buy it -- so you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss, and then watch it skyrocket.  You want to have a good, strong hand.  Buy, then hold, long term.

@_date: 2019-12-15 20:51:57
Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand.  
Bitcoin's price determines whether it is profitable for a given miner at the current difficulty setting, since his electrical costs are relatively fixed.  
If, for example, Bitcoin's price falls and remains low, many miners will stop mining - at least temporarily.  Fewer miners will cause the average time between blocks to increase, which will eventually cause the difficulty level to adjust, making it take a little less time, on average, to mine a block.
You got things backwards with respect to the cost to mine and the price of Bitcoin.  The reality is: Mining will adjust due to the price.  The price does not adjust due to miner's electrical costs.  
For example, electrical costs are roughly what they were 8 years ago when one Bitcoin might fetch a few dollars.  The cost of electricity did not go up thousands of times, but the price of Bitcoin did, which attracted more miners and motivated more efficient mining equipment.

We hold these truths to be self-evident,  
that all men are created equal,  
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  
— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  
— That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.  
— Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

Apparently you don't understand how crytocurrency/blockchain works.
* To have a crypto "coin" (or currency) requires a blockchain.
* The blockchain is secured by miners employing a lot of computer power in a competition against each other
* The miners are motivated by the potential of winning "rewards"
* The rewards are crypto coins

A smart investor looks at **all** the numbers, not just the tax number.
Your post is bullshit.  Here's a few examples why:
1. Let's say I'm in the 25 percent tax bracket.  If I "lose" $1000, I might reduce my taxable income by $1000, which reduces my tax owed by only $250.  Hello?  That's a **net loss** of $750, maybe, maybe it's even worse (see  below).  Most of us are not here to lose money by being stupid like that.
2. You don't account for whether a person is itemizing or taking the standard deduction -- huge **fail** right there, which shows you have no fucking clue about taxes, accounting, investing, etc.
3. Your stupid "tax harvesting" bullshit requires people to time the market, which is quite foolish.
4. You didn't account for the exchange fees.
5. Etc.

TA is bullshit.  Make believe.  Fairy tales.  
Your claims a bogus.  
TA is based upon bullshit. 
I'm serious. 
It goes back to before Bitcoin, before the Internet and eTrade... there were "stock brokers" who used land-line telephones to generate "churn".You see, those stock brokers were just salesmen, and they only got paid by commission, so they only got paid whenever they could convince somebody else to make a trade. When people just buy and hold long term, the salesmen go hungry.
So, they crafted this bullshit and gave it a scientific/engineering sounding name, "technical analysis." They drew lines on charts and threw jargon around to give the customer the impression that the salesman had asymmetric information and could help the customer get rich. But it was all pure bullshit.
It has subtle variants, such as "rebalancing". Still, the ultimate objective: get someone to agree to make a trade, then get a commission. It's not based upon anything other than that. 
It's bullshit, whether you can admit it or not.
Think about it: if the salesman did have special information, and/or special techniques which worked often enough, why would they be spending all day making cold calls for chump change? They would merely apply their knowledge and/or technique and become fabulously rich. BUT THEY DIDN'T.
Let that soak in.

**Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons**
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Republic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **137 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

This is more challenging than it might seem at first glance.  Most people believe they already understand money, and why shouldn't they?  They use it all the time, right?  But the sad fact is, very few people really understand "money".  Do you?  Be honest.  It's okay if you don't understand it yet - most people don't.  It's not okay to say you do when you really don't.
Anyhow, once a person understands "money" they're instantly able to see the problems and benefits of the various forms of money (past and present), and they're able to see the beauty of Bitcoin.

Yes.  Many of my "solution" ideas led to the "lost of privacy" rabbit hole (where I stop).
The counterfeit-resistant bills could be taken in (somewhere) and exchanged for actual Bitcoin (sent to the bill owner's address).  Thus, the 2nd though Nth person to cash in the same counterfeit would be denied...  this could include the legitimate owner.  That bothers me a little.  
Perhaps we could throw a wrench at the counterfeiters.  Suppose that there was a publicly available list of (a) bills which have been redeemed (out of circulation) and a list of (b) bills for which counterfeits are known to exist (2 or more of the same ID have been taken in for redemption).  A smartphone could easily scan and look up any bill a person received (or a supermarket cash register could, too).  If a bill is on either list, it's "bad".  This helps, but isn't 100% fair or effective.
Large transactions should go through the regular blockchain, and the bills would be for relatively small amounts - enough to buy lunch, coffee, cab fare, etc.  If somebody gets fucked over due to counterfeiting, it would only be for a small amount.   This is not 100% fair or effective.  
Meanwhile, using enough bits... a person could start a "bill registration" chain, similar to BIP39, where they would generate a new "user id" for each bill they received (similar to how BIP39 allows multiple keys/addresses from a single seed), then they could register that "user 120099 has bill 10377 at  13:43:22.006 GMT" -- I suppose the person spending would have to sign some kind of transaction, "I'm spending bill 10377"... we're back to either a slow blockchain or a central authority.  
The thing is, even without the registration and/or signed "I'm spending bill 10377"... it's still better than current fiat currencies.  I mean, I go buy lunch and hand the guy a $10 bill and he doesn't flinch.  That bill could be counterfeit.  That bill is certainly not backed by Bitcoin, gold, or anything but thing but thin air and yet people gladly take them without flinching.  
Let's keep thinking about this...

That's what they call "a red herring fallacy".  Bitcoin is what it is - regardless of who did or did not invent it.
Description: Attempting to redirect the argument to  another issue to which the person doing the redirecting can better  respond. While it is similar to the [avoiding the issue fallacy]( the red herring is a deliberate diversion of attention with the intention of trying to abandon the original argument.
If Satoshi were ever identified, the next attacks would be "ad hominem" -- another logical fallacy.

There will only ever be, at most, 21 million Bitcoins, and likely much fewer than that.  
There were about 36,000,000 millionaires, last I checked, plus some billionaires.  There's not enough BTC for each of the millionaires to have even 0.5 BTC.  
Hint: Negative Interest Rates.  Look, if **negative fucking interest rates** don't grab your attention and scream, "**RED ALERT!  FIAT MONEY IS FLAT-LINING WHILE ON LIFE SUPPORT,"** then let me encourage you to learn about what's going on, and why this is a HUGE deal.  
Not only that, but the days of US Dollar hegemony are over.  So far, other countries are resorting to hoarding physical gold and/or substituting their own fiat currencies for trade settlement, but that's not likely to last.  First, gold still has the problems it had in the past: it's expensive to store and very expensive to transport, and it needs to be assayed.  Also, it is easily taken by force.  (Bitcoin does the job of gold, but costs next to nothing to store, is relatively inexpensive to transport, and cannot be taken by force for all practical purposes.)
Fiat currencies are doomed.  They were doomed from the start.  Since 1971, the clock on this "time bomb" has been ticking.  "Money," as most people now alive have come to know it, is dying, right before your eyes.   
So that leaves **Bitcoin to become the next de facto Global Reserve Currency**, and that is WAY HUGE BULLISH LONG TERM.

You should learn something: what it actually means to say that a currency is "backed by" something.  It's a common misconception, and until recently I didn't understand it, either.
Here is what I learned.  When currency C is backed by something, say, G, that means that anybody can walk into a bank and exchange C for G.  When the dollar was "backed by" silver, it meant that each dollar "bank note" could be taken to a bank and exchanged for a certain amount (weight) of silver.
With the correct definition of "backed by" in mind let's take a look at something you said:  
*"Fiat Currency is backed by the legal, economic, and to an extent, military strength of the country".*  
Really?  I can take a $100 bill into a bank and exchange it for the "military strength" it is backed by?  Nope.
The US Dollar is backed by NOTHING.  Nothing at all.  Let that soak in.

First. You can't time WHEN Bitcoin will go up (or down) in price.  You might max out, buy BTC, and then watch it fall 60% in price and stay there for a year or two... or three.
Second, your credit rating will be ruined, and it could affect your ability to obtain or maintain employment.  
Third, life goes on.  Bitcoin is not to the point where you can use only Bitcoin; most grown ups still need to use fiat currency to: earn a living, put a roof over our head, buy groceries, pay utilities, pay for transportation, buy clothes, pay for medical/dental insurance/care... and much more.
Your proposal is just stupid.  You didn't even stop to think about it, or if you did, your brain doesn't work right.

Price is determined by supply and demand.  
Supply comes from sellers.  
Demand comes from buyers.  
In fact, the price of Bitcoin determines who can/cannot mine profitably.  Mining costs do not drive the price.
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:23:49
Explain, specifically, what is: "**everything in their power** to keep the price down."
Answer: Nothing they can do, except, perhaps add to the volatility and then point at the volatility they've created and make bogus claims that Bitcoin is "bad" because is it "too volatile".
Well, given the choice between Bitcoin, which IS volatile, but which has also been doubling in value each year (long term average), between that and Fiat money which is not volatile, but is guaranteed to lose value over the long run...  
* Bitcoin: bumpy ride to the moon
* Fiat: smooth ride to zero

Netflix sux.  
People recommended it to me.  I tried to look up what movies and shows they have.  There is no such list, you have to sign up to find out what they offer.  So, I signed up.  
Their "trial period" was great.  I would search for things I wanted to watch, and they had some of them, until a few months later...  "oh yeah, we have that, but you have to pay extra..."  WTF?  
Then they increased the monthly fee.  
I hardly ever watch TV in the first place.  grumble-grumble...  
I went to ebay and found I could buy DVDs of things I want to watch, for a few dollars each, and only have to pay once.  So, for what I used to pay Netflix, I can now buy 3 DVDs per month, which is more than I actually watch...  So, I save money.

We get "weak hand" investors.  Fools who "bet" next month's rent that the price of Bitcoin will go this way or that, for example.  They get caught with their pants down, then rent comes due and they get liquidated, and rightly so.
We also get a lot of inexperienced investors - people who've never invested in anything before.  They haven't been through a crash before; they haven't owned anything that did well, or did poorly.  They have no discipline, nor should they.  Riding it out, taking "punches in the face" as you go is how you learn.  Later, after experiencing "the school of hard knocks" first hand, they'll know **why** people say things like:
* don't put all your eggs in one basket
* don't put all your eggs into just two baskets
* don't invest more than you can afford to lose
* don't invest heavily in things you don't understand
* don't invest without an "exit strategy"
* have an emergency cash cushion
* easy come, easy go
* you can't time the market
* TA is bullshit
* don't listen to realtors
* what worked for your grandparents (or parents) probably won't work for you
* use dollar-cost-averaging
* just buy and hold, long term
* be patient
For example, I had a friend who owned rental properties.  He would tell me about the horrible things some of the tenants would do, things that cost him a lot of money, time, hassle...  I asked him how he could stand it, how he could be so calm about it.  He taught me, "It's just a business, just money, numbers in a spreadsheet - profits and losses.  I have a long term plan and when times are good save up for when times are bad.  If you get all emotional when things don't go your way, you should find something else to do."  Somebody stole his fence!  Some people would be furious.  He said, "Eh.  What are you going to do?  Me?  Buy a new fence."  As time went on, he got better and better at screening tenants, which brings up another good point:
* always be learning

If gold were not so scarce, it's value would be on par with copper or aluminum.

1. Durable
2. Portable
3. Divisible
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. Scarce
7. Expensive/impossible to create and/or counterfeit
Gold has all of those properties.  Bitcoin has all of them, too.
A few words about volatility:
1. As Bitcoin's market cap grows, volatility is expected to diminish
2. Yes, Bitcoin is volatile, but the ROI has averaged more than 100% per year, so far.  In other words, Bitcoin has been an ultra-excellent **long term store of wealth**

Most investors are morons.  Just because somebody says they're an investor doesn't mean they know what they're doing, or that they've been making money and/or beating people like me who just buy and hold long term (stocks, Bitcoin, whatever...)  
Most people have no clue about what Bitcoin actually is, nor the basics of how it works.  Some do, and we're buying and holding long term.  
Most people have no clue about bond yields and/or yield curves.  Most people have no idea what a central bank is nor what a central bank actually does.  Most people have no clue about money, nor where their money comes from, goes to, etc.  Most people have been brainwashed to believe that Keynesian "economists" know what's going on, have the answers... 
Most people are struggling to get from paycheck to paycheck without accumulating even more credit card debt.  These people don't have wealth to protect, and they have no funds to invest long term into Bitcoin.  
Some of those with significant wealth are about to find themselves motivated to learn all about Bitcoin, and to start Buying it as a hedge, as a "safe haven asset".  The others will simply be wiped out.

This is all confusing to you because you lack understanding.
I would like to encourage you to learn the following:  
  *  What "money" is, what forms of money have people used in the past, what forms are they using now, and why.  Where does money come from?  Where does it go to?  What makes one form of money better than another.  Why have people used gold for money?  Why did they stop?  Did they really stop?  
  *  What Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works  
  *  The truth about the current state of the central banking fiat currency based global financial system
An excellent book: "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.
An intro video to watch:

Think about international trade: energy, foods, raw materials, finished goods...  Let's take energy.  A typical oil tanker holds about 2 million barrels of oil.  A barrel of oil costs, about $50.  2M times $50 = $100M.  There are about 11,000 oil tankers transporting oil around the globe.  That's just one example of international trade, which must be settled.  Suppose certain countries start using Bitcoin instead of the USD.  
The FOREX market is the largest market in the world with a daily volume of about $5 Trillion.  Suppose Bitcoin gets used for even a small percentage of that.  There will still ever only be, at most,  21 million BTC.  
This is what I've bet on, what I've been waiting for, for years.  Compared to where I see Bitcoin going in the next 5 to 10 years, $12K is "nothing".

Okay.  Fair enough.
One time there was an earthquake, which generated a tsunami.  People on an island in the path of the tsunami were warned, but tsunami warnings were a new thing.  Some of the islanders moved to higher ground, away from the water.  Others mocked the warning or just ignored it.  Then the tsunami hit.
You see, tsunamis don't take a vote, or a poll.  Tsunamis don't wait until everybody "understands".  Neither do financial disasters wait until "all the people understand."

Maybe start by moving some small portion from the exchange to a wallet.  Then send some from the wallet to a friend, or to make a small donation, or to buy something inexpensive - the idea is for you to become more familiar with the wallet, to see for yourself that it works.  Also, use small amounts so that if you make a mistake, it's not an expensive one.  
After that, perhaps move more and more.  Maybe end up with half at the exchange and half in your wallet.  Something like that.

Well, those people are being lied to.
Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 37 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

Think about Bitcoin as the Global Reserve Currency.  Not an official reserve currency, but the de facto kind.

Before I was born, people were told that nuclear power would give everybody plentiful, cheap, and clean energy.  That's not what happened.  Nuclear power turned out to be expensive, extremely dangerous, and it produced extremely toxic waste which we still don't know how to properly dispose of.  
Then, we were told that nuclear fusion (as opposed to fission) was just around the corned.  Not only was it going to provide everybody with plenty of cheap, clean energy, but we'd be able to harness some of the heat to literally turn 99.9% of man's waste into pure plasma, which could then be split into streams of raw elements...  Do you see that happening?  I've waited a long time, and have given up my excitement that I'll ever see it.  
You think were about to have an abundance of cheap, clean energy and that it will be fairly shared among everyone?  Good luck.  That would be nice.  But I'm quite certain that even if that materialized, Bitcoin blocks are still going to very difficult and very expensive to mine.  
What is **certain**: The global financial system, based entirely upon fiat currencies will collapse before we get cheap, clean energy to everyone.  When that happens, Bitcoin will be like lifeboats and life preservers on a rapidly sinking ship.  I recommend people acquire their Bitcoin before the collapse, as opposed to after...

To understand Bitcoin, to more fully appreciate it, you need to understand "money."  
When you understand "money" you'll also understand "fiat currency" (and central banking).  
When you understand "fiat currency" (and central banking) you will understand the serious problems baked into it.  You will also be able to recognize the signs that the current system, based upon central bank fiat currencies, is dying, collapsing, imploding.  
The ship is sinking.  Time to find a lifeboat.  Don't wait for the "captain and crew" to make a formal announcement, because that's not going to happen.  Don't wait for the ship to suddenly, violently tilt/list/tip... because then it will be too late to protect yourself... at that point, you'll have to pay dearly to get a seat on a lifeboat -- better to be the guy who snagged a lifeboat ahead of time, to be the one selling seats for very high prices.

Nutshell: The private key is like a password.  The password works for one address (like an account).  Without that password, you can never spend or sell your Bitcoins from that address.  With that password, the Bitcoins can be spent - by anybody.  
Most Bitcoin users end up owning several address/private-key pairs.
The idea is: Keep your "passwords" (private keys) safe, so they are available when you want to send/spend Bitcoin.  At the same time, keep your "passwords" safe from thieves, robbers, hackers... keep them safe from fires, floods, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, etc.  
To keep the "passwords" safe and secure, most people use a computer program (or a special hardware device) called a "wallet".  The wallet help you generate and keep track of addresses and private keys ("accounts" and "passwords").  The wallet also helps you generate and broadcast a transaction when you want to send Bitcoins.
**If you lose your private key(s) you lose your Bitcoins.  Period.**   
**Similarly, if you allow a "bad actor" to gain access to your private keys, they will steal your Bitcoins and there is no way to get them back.**

@_date: 2019-09-14 15:22:35
First, YOU must have a decent understanding.  Forget about price and price predictions (for now).
Start here:
To appreciate Bitcoin, you need to understand what it is, the basics of how it works **and** the problem(s) it solves.
To understand Bitcoin, you need to understand "money".  Read, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous -- he explains money very nicely, then goes on to explain what makes Bitcoin so good.
**Meanwhile**: You can try this approach: Start with things your father is already familiar with, then show him how Bitcoin is "like that".  For example, a **Ledger**.  Your dad already has a checking account - that's just a ledger.  In fact, it is a **digital ledger** \- stored in the bank's computer system.  "See, dad, you're already using digital money via a digital ledger."  Chances are, your dad pays his bills on-line.  "See, dad, you're already sending digital ledger money across the Internet."  Since your dad is smart, he'll ask, "So, why do I need Bitcoin, then?"
This is the big hurdle.  What's in it for him?
Since your dad is a responsible, intelligent person, he watches the news.  Recent news topics include **negative interest rates, trade wars, central banks around the globe hoarding gold.**  Ah, your father is already familiar with gold.  Show him how much gold has been hoarded over the last ten years by Russia, China, India, and private citizens of Japan and Korea.  They know better than to trust the US Dollar.  Gold has special properties which the Dollar lacks.  Bitcoin has those same properties, making it a good form of money -- money which cannot be hypreinflated away.
Ah!  Bitcoin is **even better than gold**.  Why?  Imagine using Bitcoin for international settlements.  That's huge.  Oil, ores, food, finished goods, etc.  They can't really use gold for that because gold is too expensive and slow to transport securely.  For example, an oil tanker shows up, and unloads 2 million barrels of oil at a port.  The tanker captain says, "That will be, $120 Million, but we don't take dollars, so, **2.5 Tons of gold**.  Imagine transporting 5000 lb. of gold back to Saudi Arabia, without getting robbed along the way.  **Or, there could be one Bitcoin transaction to pay for the oil and delivery.  That transaction would cost only a few dollars worth of Bitcoin and there would be six confirmations in about an hour.**
Now multiply that by by 11,000 oil tankers.  Then figure all the ores, grains, finished goods (shoes, cars, etc.)...  **This is the future of Bitcoin - (de facto) Global Reserve Currency.**  Again, show your dad news articles - countries around the world are ditching the USD because it is being used as a weapon, and people aren't stupid.  They have to use **something**, switching to another fiat currency solves nothing, and gold is not practical - Bitcoin solves this very big, and very serious problem.  It's just a matter of time.
Now would be a good time to mention the 21 million Bitcoin limit.  Then ask your father to estimate, "if Bitcoin was used for settlement of only 10% of global trade, and nothing else, what price do you suppose 1 BTC would fetch?"
Compared to that, $10K per BTC is pretty fucking cheap, no?
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:07:25

He'll get to find out what it's like to keep missing out because the new thing isn't exactly like the old thing.  
Then, he totally blows it by not knowing that **central banks have a monopoly on money, not 'governments' as he claims.**  
Meanwhile: **volatility?**  I can park my wealth in something that, in spite of its volatility has more than doubled in value each year (long term average), vs bullshit fiat currency that is "racing to the bottom" as we speak -- that is -- steady erosion of my parked wealth.
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:15:43

Most people are good.  
There are "sociopaths" among us (psychopaths).  They really have no feelings for other people.  Like robots, they just don't care if anybody else suffers or dies.  They lack the ability to feel empathy and/or remorse.  There is no cure.  
There is no way to tell in advance whether you are dealing with a genuine human being or one of the sociopaths.  Therefore, the safest thing to do is always assume that the other person is a sociopath or could turn into one in a heartbeat.

In no particular order:  
Law - no bankers went to jail as a result of 2008/9.  Trillions of dollars worth of fiat currencies have since been created by central bankers -- this amounts to theft, but it's okay for the ultra-rich to steal from the rest of us.  All that money creation ("printing") creates asset bubbles. 
Blockchain/Bitcoin - no dickhead banker can create Bitcoin from thin air.

Meanwhile, suppose you need toilet paper, but your currency is deflationary.  Are you going to wait a few years to buy toilet paper because it will be a few cents cheaper in  a few months?  Same for food, transportation, utilities, medical, dental, etc.
Also, the prices for electronics are always falling, yet people have continued to buy better and cheaper radios, computers, calculators, phones, cameras...

The reckless borrowing happened in the mid-to-late 1920's; it created an asset bubble in the stock market.  There was, at that time, a lot of buying of stocks on margin - that is, with leverage.  Like any financial bubble, it was not sustainable, and it popped.  The stock market crashed as a result.  
Today, we're facing a similar situation.  Some (myself included) see it as being even bigger that 1929.  The crash we are in for will be the biggest financial disaster of all time, ever.
Bitcoin is not the cause, not the problem.  Rather, for some, Bitcoin will be like a lifeboat as the ship slips into the dark, icy waters.  Money, as most people have come to know it, is on its deathbed.  Fiat currencies are dying.

As posted earlier:
# Why quantum computers do not pose a risk to bitcoin. (The quantum fud campaign has worked in the past and it worked this time. People need to learn to rebuke this false narrative)
**The claim:** Quantum computers can hack bitcoin and its right around the corner.
There is no known way that quantum computers can break SHA256 (only the signing elliptic curve/ECDSA). So **cold wallets will always be safe** (this means you have not made an outgoing transaction in that wallet)
**This also means you will always be safe in actively making transactions** as long as wallet providers upgrade the functionality to constantly move your funds to a new address on each transaction (this already exists in several wallets). Its a simple software update.
There is a larger discussion on upgrading bitcoin, the fact that quantum computers are not even close to being able to crack ECDSA, etc. But I'm just going to leave it at what I said above. **Your Bitcoin is not at risk from quantum computing.**

Bitcoin is a ledger.  A digital ledger, copies of which are spread across the globe in thousands of computers.  Bitcoin allows money to be sent around the world using the Internet.
If you have a checking account, you're already using a digital ledger.  If you pay your bills on-line, you're already sending money via the Internet.
So, what makes Bitcoin special?

Think about if you had to move one billion dollars worth of gold - securely.
That's more than twenty tons of gold.
Think of the two vaults: source and destination, the construction costs, the security costs.  
Think of the transportation issues, the costs, the security and its cost.  The time it takes.  
And then, when the gold gets to its new owner, it should be assayed, which adds cost and takes time.  
Here we have a billion dollars sent over the Internet, in an "instant".  Secured and confirmed within an hour.  For ten bucks.  
**This is where Bitcoin shines; this is the future of Bitcoin; this is why Bitcoin will become the de facto Global Reserve Currency.**

Assuming you're going to hold, long term...
If you move your Bitcoin off of the exchange before it goes up in price, then hold... there's no "gain" to be seen by the US government.
On the other hand, if you let the coins sit at the exchange, and the price goes up, then you move the Bitcoins or sell them, the government will see a gain, which is taxed (at this time).
You should plan to hold for a long time - you'll be so glad you did.

Lacking popularity at the moment is not a fundamental flaw in the design or implementation, as the kid in the video asserts.
Besides, I see Bitcoin as becoming the de facto global reserve currency, replacing the USD (and/or any fiat currency), replacing gold stored in vaults.

Eventually, as the USD collapses into oblivion we reach a point known as "backwardation" - a word which means that nobody in their right mind will part with Bitcoin for ANY amount of USD.

First,  TA is subjective. As opposed to math or science, with TA everybody gets  his/her own "answer". It's more like reading tea leaves, palm reading,  or visiting a "psychic". Of course, the people who pay to visit the  psychic will swear that the psychic is real, but it isn't real.
Second,  TA is firmly rooted in bullshit, by professional liars -- desperate  stock brokers trying to generate "**churn**" (to earn fees) by tricking  gullible people into believing that the broker has special knowledge,  tools, abilities, etc. Think about it: IF the broker had some sort of  advantage, they could quickly become excessively wealthy, but there they  are... trying to generate "**churn**" to earn fees to pay their bills.  I guess they DON'T have a special, market-beating advantage after all.
Third,  TA presumes that tomorrow's price direction depends only upon recent  price changes.  That presumption is false.  Tomorrow's price depends  upon tomorrow's supply and tomorrow's demand, which are partly  influenced by recent price changes, but mostly influenced by events -  events which have nothing whatsoever to do with recent price changes.   For example, the leader of a country decides to make a tweet, or some  other government announces a new law/policy dealing with Bitcoin and or  economics...  or a central bank decides to make an announcement about  interest rates, QE, etc.

Okay.  
When your Bitcoins are at "coinbase", then they control the private keys and you just have to trust them while your Bitcoins are there.  As others rightly point out, it is not wise to trust any exchange any longer than necessary.  
The modern wallets are nice.  When you set one up, it will give you a list of 24 words, which you will very carefully write down and double/triple check for accuracy.  You'll then want to store that list of words in a secure place where no "bad actor" is likely to find it.  
You'll also want to make a copy of that word list and store it in a separate, secure location in case your home gets robbed, burns down, gets flooded or blown away by a tornado or covered in volcanic ash... hit by a small asteroid, has a jet crash into the roof...

The danger is the pervasive brainwashing via TV, mass media, social media...
They're not **reading** our minds, they're **writing** thoughts/feelings into our minds.
What I've found interesting is that most people will agree that **others** have been brainwashed, "but not **me**."  It can be fun to come up with ways to show them a small sample of how they've had things stored in their permanent memory, without any effort on their part, and without them even knowing it was being put there.  (TV commercial slogans, for example... "You deserve a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ today.")
How is this related to Bitcoin?
Well, people are being told that Bitcoin is only good for criminal activity, etc., etc.  That's what sticks.  People have been largely brainwashed to believe that the central bank is good, that the central bank "rescued" us in 2009, and that anybody who starts talking about central banking must be crazy.

* It is extremely expensive and time consuming to transport gold securely
* Bitcoin can be sent securely to anyplace on earth in a matter of minutes for a small fee (a few dollars)

If you have no other significant savings, then I would encourage you to consider what would happen if you lost your job (through no fault of your own), and jobs were scarce?  In other words, what if you had to go 3 or 4 months with no job?  7, 8, 9 months?  If you could just move back into your old bedroom with your parents, then your acceptable risk level is going to be different than say, if you have a wife and kids and 6 months of no job would literally put you all on the street.

You imply that, for example, the Fed's actions are a **result** of Bitcoin's recent price history.  
Clearly it is not.  
Clearly, you have things backwards.  
Clearly, the actions of the Federal Reserve and/or other central banks and/or governments around the world vis-a-vis other unforeseen global events will influence the price of Bitcoin.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.
Lately, more and more people seem to have this idea that governments are all-powerful and that they give us rights, out of the kindness of their hearts.  
Fact is, governments exist only because we agree that **giving** certain, limited powers to a government, that is, having some law and order is better than **no** law and order (anarchy, chaos).
"Give us your password or we'll throw you in jail," clearly crosses the line, in my opinion.

Dear Noobs:  
If a person can't explain something in layman's terms, then they don't really understand it.  
Thus, when you bump into somebody using jargon (buzzwords, techno-speak) and they can't explain what they're saying to you in terms that you understand, that person is called a "bullshitter".  Avoid people like that.
You don't need to know anything about advanced cryptography or computer science to understand Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's energy consumption -- 3 shots vs 55 gallons
"Alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping*   66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  "Almost as much as the   Czech Rebublic".  They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year.  One hundred and ten thousand.  Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans.  0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One **inch** out of **37 feet**.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**
Is that really a significant amount?
Another   thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin   is "wasted".  I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When   somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just   shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

Here's what I had to do:
1. Realize that there are serious and significant problems with fiat money
2. Realize that there are serious and significant problems with the global financial system, which is largely based upon flawed fiat money... Wall St. is a "crime scene" for example.
3. Realize that I needed a way to protect my meager savings from inflation and/or outright confiscation (as in the case of Cyprus)
4. Wait for Bitcoin to be invented, then discover it
5. Realize that Bitcoin is a solution to 1, 2, and 3 above
6. Learn later about governments being able to lock people out of the financial system.  Happily, Bitcoin solves this problem, too.
7. Realize, sadly, that most people don't give a fuck; they believe the bullshit spewed at them, daily, by their television sets and other mass media (including so-called social media).  The general population has been brainwashed to immediately assume that anybody who is critical of the "status quo" is insane.
8. Realize that most people are broke -- they don't even have $400 saved up for an emergency.  Thus, the average "dude" has no wealth to protect.  The average "dude" has no money to buy Bitcoin, either.
9. Realize that there may never be a "mass adoption," before the collapse of the fiat system.  People will resort to "local currencies" and barter.  Silver coins, for example, could end up being used for buying food, transportation, etc.
10. Realize that there is a really, really good use case for Bitcoin: International trade settlement.  The competitors are: USD, some other fiat currency, gold parked in vaults, Bitcoin, commodity backed "shit coins".  My bet is that Bitcoin will win, because it is superior, and the people doing international trades (eg, there are 11,000+ oil tankers sailing around... some with 2 to 4 million barrels of oil at about $50 per barrel... grains, ores, lumber, finished goods, etc.)  This is certainly at least part of the future of Bitcoin.  
11. Bitcoin will never be evenly distributed among humans, even if mass adoption happens.  So, calculating the average number of satoshi per person is futile, even though it is "interesting" to ponder.

People used to use gold for money.  It was a "natural" currency, not a "national" currency.  Gold has certain properties necessary to be "good/strong" money:
* Durable
* Divisible
* Portable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* **Scarce**
* Expensive/difficult to produce and/or counterfeit
Still, gold is not without its challenges:
* Must be stored securely
* Difficult, expensive, slow to transport securely in significant amounts
* Can be adulterated.  Example: gold coated tungsten
* Can be (and has been!) taken by force
Long ago, instead of having each person build a vault in his/her home, people realized that the local goldsmith already had a very secure vault, with 24/7 security.  
People deposited their money (gold) at the bank (goldsmith) and received banknotes.  Those notes were "backed by" gold, that is a person could take such a note to the bank and exchange it for the amount (weight) of gold printed on the note.  
So far, so good.  
Dishonest goldsmiths/bankers would issue more notes than they had gold in their vault to cover.  Today, they call it "fractional reserve lending," but it's based upon fraud.  Depositors would get wind of the scam, then literally RUN to the bank to get their gold out, before the bank would run out of gold.  Bank runs were common.  People were twitchy, and rightly so.  
So, **healthy distrust of bankers goes way back in time**.  
Fast-forward to now; things are even worse:
* The notes are no longer backed by gold - they don't even pretend to be
* The "notes" no longer need to be physically printed - 90% or more of today's "money" exists only as digital bits inside bank computer ledgers
* Central bankers can create as much of their "money" as they want by merely typing numbers into their computers
* Central bankers have recently created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat "play money" since around 2008
* When new money is created like that, it literally steals wealth from the rest of us
* The theft-by-money-"printing" creates serious problems in the economy; the only "solution" the criminal bankers have is to create even more money. 
* The current system is not sustainable - never has been, never will be.  Thus **a healthy distrust of bankers is your friend**.  
* We are currently witnessing the end of the fiat money game.  The game is rigged: the bankers and their cronies are guaranteed to win, the rest of us are guaranteed to lose. ***Who wants to compete in a "game" like that?***  *Especially when we're talking about being able to provide for ourselves and loved ones with housing/shelter, food, medical care, security, clothes, shoes, entertainment, transportation, etc...*
Meanwhile, **Bitcoin fixes things!**  It levels the playing field.  It lets us say, "fuck you," to the criminal central bankers and their cronies.

Don't drive an exotic car with a HODL license plate.  Don't blab that you own a lot of Bitcoin.  
Install security cameras in/around your home which record securely to a remote server 24/7.  In the event of a home invasion robbery, calmly explain to the robber(s):
1. He's already been recorded.
2. He's not getting any Bitcoin, no matter what; that's not an option
3. If he leaves right away, you'll report him, a couple of beat-cops will stop by, fill out a report, go back to their car and crack jokes about "bit coins".  He'll probably get away with his attempt (but won't score any BTC).
4. If he stays and harms anybody, then some of the best cops, the detectives, will be sent to investigate -- they will find and view the security footage.  They won't give up until they have caught and convicted the robber(s) -- and the robbers STILL won't get any BTC.

When they create money like that, they're stealing from the rest of us instead of letting the losers lose in a more-or-less free market.

About 90 percent of US Dollars are already digital.  They only exist in banking system centralized ledgers.
If/when they try to eliminate "cash" -- we must all resist.  With a no-cash society, the bankers will be able to say, "we don't like what Joe wrote, so we'll put restrictions on where he can spend money and what he can buy."  Please take this seriously.

 Wise up: Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons
Some "alarmists" claim that Bitcoin uses a whopping 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. "Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.
Is it a significant amount?
The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.
Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or $.06 out of $100.00.
Six cents out of a hundred bucks.
One inch out of 37 feet.
Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.
A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.
One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.
Is that really a significant amount?
Another thing some of the "alarmists" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is "wasted". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.
When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

Even better than people adopting Bitcoin to buy food, transportation, pay bills, etc. consider an even better use case for Bitcoin: **international trade settlements**.  That's  huge.  Oil, ores, food, finished goods, etc.  They can't really use gold  for that because gold is too expensive and slow to transport securely.   For example, an oil tanker shows up, and unloads 2 million barrels of  oil at a port.  The tanker captain says, "That will be, $120 Million,  but we don't take dollars, so, **2.5 Tons of gold**.  Imagine transporting 5000 lb. of gold back to Saudi Arabia, without getting robbed along the way.  **Or,  there could be one Bitcoin transaction to pay for the oil and delivery.   That transaction would cost only a few dollars worth of Bitcoin and  there would be six confirmations in about an hour.**
Now multiply that by by 11,000 oil tankers.  Then figure all the ores, grains, finished goods (shoes, cars, etc.)...  **This is the future of Bitcoin - (de facto) Global Reserve Currency.**   Again, show your dad news articles - countries around the world are  ditching the USD because it is being used as a weapon, and people aren't  stupid.  They have to use **something**,  switching to another fiat currency solves nothing, and gold is not  practical - Bitcoin solves this very big, and very serious problem.   It's just a matter of time.
After fiat collapses, I believe most people will resort to using "local currency" and/or silver coins and/or Bitcoin and/or .... wait and see.

The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand.
Supply comes from sellers.  Demand from buyers.  
When the price of Bitcoin goes up, more people are willing to attempt to mine.  When the price of Bitcoin goes down, some miners find it difficult/impossible to make a profit and they stop mining.  
Thus, the amount of mining is driven by the price of Bitcoin which is driven by supply and demand.  If the cost to mine falls, it will not affect the price of Bitcoin in a significant way, but it is likely to affect the amount of mining activity.

I see countries scrambling to escape USD hegemony.  I see central banks and governments and even individuals hoarding gold.  I see a currency war.  I see trade wars.

Here's a video to watch:
First, learn the difference between a blockchain, Bitcoin, a wallet, and an exchange.
Blockchain is a ledger - an ordered list of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.  A transaction is when a certain amount of Bitcoin gets sent from one address to another.
Bitcoin is the unit of money.
A wallet holds your private keys (similar to passwords, they enable you to spend/send your Bitcoins).  A wallet can generate a transaction to allow you to spend some or all of your Bitcoin.  A wallet can also show you how many Bitcoins (BTC) you own.
An exchange is a web site where you can use fiat currency to buy Bitcoin, or where you can sell Bitcoin for fiat currency.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme.
In a Ponzi scheme:
* there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.
* The swindler receives money from people
* The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return. That money is NOT invested. There is no money-making business venture. Any returns are paid from the swindled money.
* The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a big, fat lie.
* The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.
* A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a "crash".
* A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.
Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin price goes up (or down) because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.

That would do it.  Certainly.
Most people seem to think, "Oh, just print more money, and we'll all be rich."  They never stop to ask, "Why didn't we just print lots of money a long time ago?  Why hasn't any other country printed lots of money to become rich?"  If they did, they'd soon find out that other countries HAVE printed lots of money, and the people ended up poor.
So, who's to blame?  Serious question.  I know I was never taught about money - not in school, not in college.  Never saw a TV documentary about it.  I had to go looking, on my own.

Well, the so-called Supreme Court ruled that giving money to politicians/political parties is free speech, so money is speech, and Bitcoin is money...
...but the United States government no longer even pretends to obey the "Supreme Law of the Land".
A different question to start pondering might be, are you willing to take action to defend the rights you were born with?  The right to free speech, the right to choose your religion (or to chose no religion), the right to speak out against the government, the right to defend yourself (even from your own government), the right to be secure in your home, the right to own property, the right to a fair and speedy trial, the right to not be tortured, and so forth?

Credit cards require a fee of 2 to 4 percent, typically paid by the seller.
You can choose to use a credit card, in fact, that's typically a good idea provided you pay the balance in full each month.
Still, when there are no more Bitcoins to be mined, the miners will be paid with the fees, whether you use your credit card or not.  So, who in their right mind will want to pay the fees?  People doing international trade.  Large corporations.  Banks.  
Bitcoin is to become the new "gold" and the de facto Global Reserve Currency because:  
  *  Bitcoin does the job of gold (in this context), but does it even better  
  *  The US Dollar won't be around forever  
  *  Other fiat currencies are about to die, too  
For example, imagine sending $100 Million dollars worth of physical gold to a location in another country, thousands of miles away.  It's going to cost a lot to do that securely.  It's going to take a relatively long time for it to get to its destination.  When it arrives, it will need to be checked/assayed - which adds cost and time.  
Now, imagine sending $100 Million worth of Bitcoin.  It will only cost a few dollars, and 6 confirmations might take, on average, about one hour - and it is very secure.

For the last 30 or 40 years, they have been able to just "keep printing, keep lowering rates," thus, kicking the can down the road.  Now, with rates near zero (and below zero in places) they have literally run out of road and are confronted with their "can" (of maggot-infested shit they allowed to fester), a brick wall in front of them, and on either side... and if they turn around, they'll face the "road to ruin".

People who do frequent trades eventually end up losing all/most of their investment.  
Each trade entails **risk**, and a **fee**, and could complicate the trader's **tax** situation.  
Eventually, the aggregate risks and fees win.  
Meanwhile, people who buy and hold experience **excellent long term returns** on their Bitcoin investment without entailing unnecessary risk or fees (and without complicating their tax situation).  
In fact, long term, Bitcoin's price has more than doubled every year.  If a 100% per year (long term average) ROI is not enough for you, then you have serious issues that money can't fix.

Read, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.
To understand why Bitcoin is a wise place to park some wealth, you need to understand Bitcoin.  
To understand and appreciate Bitcoin, you need to understand "money".  Many people believe they understand money, and why not, they use it every day -- but very few people actually understand the topic at more than a very, very superficial level.
Ammous starts of by teaching enough about money, and the history of money so that when he gets to the Bitcoin part, you'll be able to "get it".
This isn't about Bickering - it's about are you willing and able to do what many of us have already done, and take the time to actually understand these things?  Once you do, there won't be any debate in your mind.

Thoughts, in no particular order:
* Like some others have said, don't go blabbing that you have any, or how much you have
* Don't wear Bitcoin logos; don't put Bitcoin stickers or slogans on your car
* Keep a relatively small amount handy, in the unlikely event that somebody gets into your home and points a gun at your head
* If threatened, tell them you keep your hardware wallet in  your safe deposit box at your bank
* Acquire and use "street smarts".  Don't walk around with your face buried in your smart phone display.  Don't walk around with ear buds.  Be aware of your general surroundings at all times -- especially when coming/going to home and/or work/school.  If you think somebody is following you, use your brain.
* Keep weapons handy, and know how to use them: guns, pepper spray, knives, etc.
* Use security cameras that upload to a distant server 24/7.  If some idiot tries the "five dollar wrench" attack, calmly explain that he's already been recorded to a place where it cannot be erased, and that you've already pressed a secret button -- the police will be arriving soon.  If he leaves now, he might get away with it - the cops will just fill out a report (they don't even know what Bitcoin is) - but if he hurts/kills anybody, then the best police detectives will soon be hunting him down, and for the small amount he might get, is it worth it?  Of course, if you go blabbing how much you have, that isn't going to work.
* Keep $200 cash in your home.  Tell the home-invader that your Bitcoins got hacked, or that you gambled and lost, but offer him the cash, "Just take this, and go."
* If nobody knows that you even have any Bitcoin, then there is really no threat.

Whether it's "official" or not - Bitcoin doesn't give a hoot.  Neither do I.  Officials are often corrupt, and even when they're not, they just humans, with flaws, like me.
Meanwhile, it wasn't long ago when I could buy my dream home for 3000 BTC.  Today, I could buy that same home for 200 BTC.  I expect that in the not-too-distant future, the same home might trade for somewhere between 5 and 10 BTC.
Why?  Supply and demand.  As more and more people ditch fiat currency and turn to Bitcoin, ...supply and demand..., the demand goes up, but the supply is, and forever will be, strictly limited.

You can't.  Nobody can.  The **only** way to create Bitcoin is to mine it.  Mining required **proof of work**, and that basically means you need to buy expensive equipment, have a place to put that equipment, have massive amounts of electrical power for that equipment and some way to cool that equipment (typically, AC, which costs $).
That's a big part of the beauty of Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, central banks around the globe are clueless about how to "fix" the economies they've broken.  Their only solution to having created too much fiat money is to create even more fiat money.  *Yes, they are that dumb.*  
**Bottom line:** this will not end well.  
Sooner or later another economic downturn hits, the mother of all global debt bubbles starts to implode, again, like 2008/9 -- but this time it hits central banks, currencies, and economies that are **still on "life support" from the prior crisis**.  This time the debt bubble is even bigger.  
Most of us will live to see the **death of 'money' as we have come to know it.**  
Fortunately, there's a **new kind of money,** one that is beyond the manipulation and control of clueless central bankers and shithead Keynesian "economists".  Money that remains hard, no matter what.  Fearless money which, over time, only goes up in value because scarcity was designed into it from it's inception.  Money with properties that make it even better than gold in the long run.  
If you're only looking at the price of Bitcoin, in USD (or whatever fiat "play money"), and looking only at recent price changes, and getting your panties in a twist about what the price (in fiat "play money") might or might do in the next few days, weeks, or months, **you're missing the best part, the whole point, the big picture,** ... and you're probably unprepared for the geopolitical shitstorm about to devastate the current global financial system.

You've got it backwards, as far as I'm concerned.
The USD is one of many fiat currencies about to bite the dust.  Why?  Because it's not backed by anything, and a small group of about 19 people get to create as much as they want, then use the new money to enrich themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of everybody else.  Because central bank interest rates are already at/near zero, and the next financial downturn appears to be upon us -- how are they going to lower rates to "stimulate" the economy this time?  If they go to negative rates, they'll have to outlaw cash, first.  Because the global debt (to GDP ratio) is at unsustainable level -- there is so much debt, that it can never be paid back.  Because in my country, idiots are believing that "MMT" (money printing) is good for the economy, that bailing out borrowers "helps everybody" and other nonsense.
Bitcoin offers me a way to ditch my USD in exchange for solid money, backed by proof of work which is not going to be inflated away or confiscated from me.

Gold, market cap: **$7,826,522,737,124.20**
The "twenty cents" part is cute.
So, about 191K tons of gold in the entire world, so far.  Nice.
About $41K per ton of gold:  I knew a guy who was, at that time, worth about $300M, or more than 7 tons of gold.  If he stored his wealth as gold:
* He would need extraordinary physical security
* Moving it securely would be very expensive, and time consuming
* The government could just "take" it from him, and/or prevent him from moving it, say, to another country
* Verifying that none of it was "impure" (tungsten filled bars, for example) would be time consuming and cost him some of his gold
He could store it all in about 34K BTC, then:
* Store it in a hardware wallet, for a few bucks
* Memorize the passphrase

What is a Ponzi scheme?
In a Ponzi scheme there is an "operator" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.  The swindler receives money from people, promising them that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return.  That money is NOT invested.  There is no money-making business venture.  Any returns are paid from the swindled money.  The entire thing is based upon a big, fat lie.  The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.  A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a "crash".  A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.
Bitcoin is legal, and honest.
Bitcoin has no central authority.
Bitcoin makes no promises.
Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a "money making venture"; Bitcoin IS money.
Bitcoin has survived several crashes.
Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.
Bitcoin goes up (or down) in price because of supply and demand in a genuine market.
Bitcoin is based upon truth, verified by mathematics: its blockchain is an immutable public record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made.
How can somebody call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?
If that person knows what Bitcoin is and what a Ponzi scheme is -- that person is a liar, and probably mentally unhinged.
If that person does not know that "Bitcoin" is or does not know what a Ponzi scheme is, then... Well, WHAT KIND OF PERSON goes around "attacking" things they don't understand, using words they don't know the meanings of?
Normal, well-adjusted, honest people don't do that.

If you're extra paranoid, good.  In that case, go to:
...get the javascript code, then put it onto a computer that will Never Ever be connected to the Internet, EVER again.  For example, an older computer which never gets used, or buy a cheap computer (Raspberry Pi).
Then.  Get some high quality dice (or die).  Using that code, you can roll a die about 100 times, then (carefully) enter the number for each roll, and compute a Private Key / Public Key pair.
Write down the Private Key, then double check it, then wait a little while and check it again -- you must copy it Exactly, it is case sensitive.  Some say (including me) not to send it to a printer because the printer could get hacked.  It's rare, but, if you're going to lock something up that will be worth millions of today's dollars (eventually), you probably want to be extra paranoid.
While you're at it, might as well generate a few Private/Public Key pairs.  Double-and-triple check what you've written down.
Now - make a back up copy, very carefully... double-triple check the back ups.  Store the back up copy in a Secure, separate location -- for example, if your entire area burns to the ground or gets flooded, you don't want to lose both copies.
Find clever places to store them, securely.  Not near the kitchen, for example, because of fire and leaky pipes, etc.
Or, just fork over and buy a hardware wallet and take advantage of the pass phrase word sequence thing.

We have a small group of people (19, in the case of USD) with the sole ability to legally create all the fiat currency they choose, from thin air, backed by nothing.
Since about 2007, many tens of trillions of dollars worth of fiat currency has been created by this small group - at the expense of the many (ordinary people) - and has enriched and empowered this small group and their cronies.
This group is not "elite" (as the MSM would have us believe).  They are not inherently superior, not smarter, ..., they don't work harder...  Their only power is their ability to "print" money.  When they print money they transfer actual wealth from us, to themselves, unfairly, without our permission --- this is theft.  They are crooks, thieves.  Also, they are either horribly inept, or liars or *both*.

The idea here should be: get your hands on as much BTC as you can reasonably afford, and hold onto it.  Meanwhile, wait and watch for the next financial crisis -- it will be the most shattering financial catastrophe of all time, the mother of all meltdowns, and ultimately the death of "money" as you have known it in your lifetime.

**Any time somebody claims their "crypto" is "backed" by anything (other than its inherent scarcity), you know they're scamming.  Don't get scammed.  Don't be a sucker.**
Once upon a time, people used gold as money.  People with lots of money found it convenient and affordable to store most of their gold with a local goldsmith, since the goldsmith had to have good 24/7 security anyhow.  The goldsmith would issue a "note" for each deposit into his "bank".  Banknotes were born.  "Good as gold."  Take one to the goldsmith and get the gold back, just like that.  
Those were **gold backed notes.**  They were "backed by gold".  Okay?  Simple enough?  Right??
Fast forward.  Eventually, we have "Federal Reserve Notes" - the original shitcoin.   Not backed by gold; not backed by anything.  BTW, the Federal Reserve has NO reserves.  Scam.
Now.  Now we have Bitcoin.  What backs Bitcoin?  Same thing that backs gold - its scarcity, mostly.
"Oh.  I'm a crook.  Ignore that.  I have my new money, and it's 'backed by' Bitcoin."  **Oh yeah??  Why don't I just use Bitcoin, then?**  "Um, I was counting on you being stupid and ignorant..."

4. Somebody sues you.  You didn't do anything wrong, but they decide to sue you.  They get wind of your exchange account, and, bam, it get's locked up.  Then they win, and they get your Bitcoin.
5. Somebody uses your social security number to commit fraud against the government.  Eventually, the government comes after you.  (Not fair, but shit happens.)  They go after your assets and discover your exchange account...
6. Similar to   You have a legitimate dispute against the IRS.  Heck, you're right, they're wrong.  They don't care, they find your exchange account, and, poof, it's gone.
7. Your country is collapsing.  You flee.  You start to establish a new life as a refugee in your new country.  You can't access your Bitcoin because it's linked to an account in your old country...

The root of so many significant problems and much human suffering, as far as I've been able to ascertain:
* There are small groups of people with the sole ability to legally create money from thin air.  If you or I did what they do, we'd be locked in jail for counterfeiting and/or fraud.
* These people not only **can** "print" massive amounts of their fiat currencies, but since about 2007 they **have** created many tens of trillions of  dollars worth of their "central banker play money".
* When fiat currency is "printed" like that, it does not create any actual wealth, but it does transfer actual wealth to a small number of people at the expense of the rest of us.  This, in effect, is a form of theft.  We're not robbing banks, rather, we're being robbed by bankers.  But now, we can thank God for Bitcoin.
So, with the ability to "print" all the money they want, they're able to buy important things:
* Actual wealth (real estate, stocks, resources, intellectual property, precious metals, yachts, jets, etc.)
* Politicians in **both** parties.  The money "printers" don't care who wins because they pretty much own and operate both major political parties, using money they created from thin air.  Directly or indirectly, they end up controlling the so-called Supreme Court (in the US, for instance).
* Mass media and the "stooge economists".  You're not likely to learn much, if any of the truth about the way things **really** work by watching TV, for example.  The "money printers" own and operate/control what most people see, hear, and (sadly) believe.  They use propaganda, lies, double-speak, etc. to brainwash the average person, and/or to keep their attention focused elsewhere.
To recap: a small group gets to create money, then use it to buy supreme political power, "stuff", and the minds of the masses.
**NOTE:** The **only** power the "money printers" have is their sole ability to create more and more money from nothing.  **Bitcoin** provides an alternative -- a way to escape that evil system.

Putting uninformed opinions aside, the fact is that Bitcoin has some very important properties which fiat currency is missing.
Good money has ALL of the following properties:  
 * Durable  
 * Divisible  
 * Fungible  
 * Recognizable  
 * Portable  
 * Scarce/rare  
 * Difficult to counterfeit  
Notice:  
 * gold has all 7 properties  
 * Bitcoin has all 7 properties  
 * Fiat currency is missing some. Can you see which?  
It is important to have all 7.  For example xenon gas has 6 of the 7 properties, but it is not recognizable.  Right?  I mean, if I was going to pay you with a plastic tube filled with a clear gas, how would you know I didn't just put ordinary air into that tube?  So, xenon fails as a form of "good" money.
Fiat currency can be - and has been - created by merely typing numbers into the central bank's computer, then clicking the "save" button.  In fact, since about 2007/8, many tens of trillions of dollars worth of fiat currency has actually been created by central banks around the world.
So, what's the problem with that?
Bottom line: it amounts to theft.
Consider, if YOU printed any counterfeit US Dollars, you'd go to jail for counterfeiting.  Why is counterfeiting illegal?  Because it is theft.  It is still theft, even when the central bankers do it.
For instance, suppose I hacked into a bank, and updated your balance to be $5 Trillion dollars.  You'd spend it.  You'd buy "stuff," that is, Actual Wealth.  You might end up owning a lot of land/real estate, stocks (shares of valuable businesses), precious gems, precious metals, yachts, private jets... If you're smart, you'll also buy a lot of mainstream media outlets and direct them to lie to the general public, telling them that you're so smart, that you EARNED all this stuff by being SUPERIOR to everybody else -- but you're not.  No.  You and I would just be thieves.  Criminals.
All the "stuff" you'd end up owning came, ultimately, from other people.  You took it from them (w/ my help), without permission, in an unfair manner.  That is, you stole it.
Well that's the same as when central bankers create fiat money from thin air, backed by nothing.  They use it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- and everybody else's expense.  They're thieves.  Criminals.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be created from thin air.  You'd have to mine Bitcoin, and that would cost you for equipment, space for the equipment, energy to run the machines, and it would cost you TIME.  There is no way that anybody could just "whip up" $40 Trillion dollars worth of Bitcoin by merely typing a few numbers into some bank's computer.

What if Coinbase one day says, "Nope.  Our records show that you withdrew your Bitcoin already."
What if the Federal Government steps in and shuts down Coinbase?  Poof.  No more Coinbase.  How are you going to get your Bitcoin then?
Hackers: If you were going to hack, would you hack some "dude" with a small amount of Bitcoin in an off-line wallet where he keeps the private key?  Or are you going to go after a big exchange, knowing they have lots of employees (who make mistakes), and complicated procedures and plenty of attack vectors, but most of all: LOTS AND LOTS OF BITICOINS??
"You might lose your passphrase to your wallet..."  Well, you might lose your password to get into Coinbase.  Keep a backup in a secure off-site location.

I hear what you're saying.  I used to say it too.
Here's what changed my mind:  If I have a "gold backed" note, I can trade that note for actual gold.  If I have an X-backed currency, then I would be able to exchange it back for the stated amount of physical X.
With Bitcoin, we cannot trade it in to get the spent energy back.
This is all kind of nit-picky, yes.  I know what you mean: Nobody can just create any amount of Bitcoin, willy-nilly.  Bankers and lenders create trillions of dollars, willy-nilly, and create asset bubbles, which pop.

 2. otherwise, what's the crook going to do?

They would have to have your Private Key to be able to sign a transaction to Spend your Bitcoin.
The Public key is, well, public.  Anybody can send Bitcoin TO your public key/address without knowing your Private Key.  Also, anybody can check the balance/history of that address.
To send Bitcoin from your address requires the transaction to have a valid digital signature, which requires knowing the Private Key.  So, protect your private key (pass phrase) and keep and off-site backup in a Secure location, because, without it, even you won't be able to spend Bitcoin from that public address.

...and then the current **Mother Of All Debt Bubbles** pops.  Stock markets around the globe utterly panic and trading must be suspended (at least temporarily).  Home sales wither, prices tank.  Bonds tank.  More bailouts for criminal banker losers, at the expense of fiat money savers.  "Paper gold" becomes worthless as people scramble to get their hands on the real thing.  Central banks resort to more and more QE and even negative interest rates -- their actions help those who are well-connected and already ultra rich, but rob the poor, middle, and even most of the upper class.  People start losing their jobs, through no fault of their own.  Businesses fail at an alarming rate, from small to big.
And through all that, Bitcoin shines.
As more and more people finally realize that fiat money was doomed from the start, they'll see Bitcoin for what it actually is: the new money.  Bitcoin will become the de facto global reserve currency.

According to the Wikipedia:


For example, when I was young, the US stopped minting solid silver dimes, quarters, half-dollars, and dollar coins.  If I got my change, and there was a silver dime, I'd put that into a special jar and only spend the silver-coated copper dimes, quarters, etc.
So, let's say I want to buy some socks.  Most of my black socks are wearing out.  I have fiat money in my checking account, and let's say I have some BTC in a wallet.  I know that the fiat money is ultimately worthless.  I'm completely convinced that I will see the death of fiat currency in my lifetime.  I also know that Bitcoin is the "hardest" form of money ever invented, and that it's value, as measure by the amount of "stuff" I can buy with 1 BTC will go up, up, up over time.  So, guess which form of money I'm going to buy those socks with...
Let's say, on the other hand, that an artist is selling her works, but only accepts Bitcoin.  Her works are unique, and originals -- I can only get the specific piece I want from her, by paying with Bitcoin.  I'm going to spend Bitcoin, but then rush right out to replenish.

That's nice, if it works out that way.  Sometimes, though, you may find some/all of your Bitcoin "underwater" for more than a few days, more than a few months... perhaps a couple of years or more.
Meanwhile, looking at Birtcoin as an investment to merely increase your supply of fiat money causes you to miss out on the very best part of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a new kind of money, a better kind of money (the best, IMO).  
Having said that, I need to point out that we are in a unique point in History: the beginning of the transition from a global financial system built upon central bank "play money" to the "hardest" form of money yet invented.  So, we still need/want to use fiat for paying our bills, etc.  
If your BTC goes up in value (as measured in USD, for instance), then hold onto it.  Why?  Because, like you said, you don't NEED that $60 right now.  By holding onto it as BTC, you get the benefit of **compounding**.

Bitcoin miners can ask for prices above the current market price, but they won't get it because other people are selling Bitcoin for less.  Miners are not the only people selling Bitcoin.
If a miner spent $12,200 to mine a Bitcoin and is asking $12,200, but right now people are paying $7,800, that miner isn't going to sell any BTC. Just because somebody runs a business does not guarantee they'll make a profit.

Or, how about housing?  During the prior housing bubble, home prices in many places doubled in just 3 or 4 years.  Was that because the price to build a home doubled?  No.  Then the price fell 30 or 40 percent -- was THAT because the price to build a home fell?  No.

The price of Bitcoin and the cost of mining are both driven by the demand for Bitcoin.
Supply and demand.  
The demand can (and often does) change rapidly.  
The supply follows a strict schedule - no matter what.  
When demand falls, the supply stays about the same.  So the price of Bitcoin goes down.  
When the price goes down, it could result in less mining activity, but there is a lag, a delay.  In the meanwhile, miners could spend more to produce Bitcoins than they are worth AT THAT TIME.  Some miners might just hold BTC and keep going, others may pull the plug until prices increase again.
The cost of mining is driven by the demand for Bitcoin.  The price of Bitcoin is driven by demand.  The price of Bitcoin is not determined by the price to mine a Bitcoin.

Supply and demand.
The demand can (and often does) change rapidly.
The supply follows a strict schedule - no matter what.
When demand rises, the supply stays about the same.  So the price of Bitcoin goes up.
When the price goes up, it attracts new mining activity, but there is a lag, a delay.
More mining does not produce Bitcoins at a faster rate (not for long).  More mining can increase the mining difficulty, raising the cost of mining (or reducing the expected payout rate).
The cost of mining is driven by the demand for Bitcoin, not the other way around.  JP Morgan sees a horse-drawn cart and says, "Look at that old cart pushing the horse around."

Bitcoin provides freedom.
The government regulations on fiat currencies is where the friction begins.  Then there's the fiat currency based global financial system, with it's friction, middlemen, inefficiencies...  Once you've managed to transfer wealth from that system into Bitcoin, you have freedom from things like:
 \* other people telling you who you can send money to, and when, or how much
 \* middlemen charging high fees to move money
 \* government confiscation
 \* central banker theft of wealth via "money printing"
For example, put $200,000 into some plastic bags and put the bags into the trunk of your car.  Get pulled over (in the US), and when the cops see that money, they will assume you're a criminal, and arrest you; they'll just take your money (look up "asset forfeiture laws").  They'll probably take your car, too.  Then they'll tell the bank to freeze your accounts.  What did you do wrong?  Nothing.  Did you enjoy your right to a fair and speedy trial?  No.  In fact, you just "donated" (involuntarily) to the cops' pension fund.  Do you think you'll just go down to the police station and straighten everything out?  Think again.
Or, put $200,000 worth of Bitcoin in your wallet.  Get pulled over by those same cops.  There is no way they can "take" your Bitcoin from you -- you'd have to choose to "give it up".  Also, they have no way to detect whether you have any or not.
Try traveling through an airport with $2 million cash... NO!  DON'T!  I'm just making up an example.

1. Fiat currency is literally worthless garbage.
2. Fiat currency is doomed; just a matter of time.  Nothing got significantly fixed after 2007/8/9 -- they just blew one more "mother of all debt bubbles," which is about to pop while the global economy is still on "life support" (QE, ZIRP, NIRP) from the prior bubble popping.  Certain central banks and governments have been hoarding tons of gold - they know better than to trust fiat money.
3. Central banks and governments are already planning for a cashless world where they can impose negative interest rates on money you haven't spent yet.  If they were to impose neg. rates now, smart people would just pull their cash from the banks, rather than be forced to pay the bank "interest" or "fees" every month to park their paycheck there until it has been spent.
4. Gold is expensive to transport and store securely; it sets off metal detectors.  Gold is heavy and takes up space.  Bitcoin is "practically free" to store and transport securely, relative to gold, and the transfers are "instantaneous" compared to shipping gold bars around the globe.
5. Bitcoin will become the de facto "global reserve currency," when the USD implodes, and we have a chance to buy it now, before the dummies catch on.

"Blockchain" has temporarily become a marketing buzzword.
Fact is, the blockchain is a ledger, but not just any ledger.  It is a decentralized, public, and immutable ledger.  Compared to pre-existing database technologies (RDBMS, No-SQL, etc.) it is very slow an inefficient, making it not useful for many applications.  Still, it is good for certain, limited applications, such as being the implementation of the Bitcoin ledger.
Immutability comes at a cost.  The blockchain's immutability is protected by miners - people who own and operate specialized equipment at great cost.  So, what motivates these miners to take on such costs?  Rewards!  Bitcoin rewards for mining blocks.
Note the circular dependency.  The Bitcoins would be worthless without the mining, and the mining would not be profitable without Bitcoins that can be exchanged for a reasonable amount of other stuff.
You think you're going to start a blockchain to protect your refrigerator from hackers when you connect it to the Internet?  You're an idiot.

Anyone with enough computing power can take over the network
This is true: see Weaknesses has a lot of computing power.
That said, as the network grows, it becomes harder and harder for a single entity to do so. Already the Bitcoin network's computing power is quite ahead of the world's fastest supercomputers, together.
What an attacker can do once the network is taken over is quite limited. Under no circumstances could an attacker create counterfeit coins, fake transactions, or take anybody else's money. An attacker's capabilities are limited to taking back their own money that they very recently spent, and preventing other people's transactions from receiving confirmations. Such an attack would be very costly in resources, and for such meager benefits there is little rational economic incentive to do such a thing.
Furthermore, this attack scenario would only be feasible for as long as it was actively underway. As soon as the attack stopped, the network would resume normal operation.

My journey has been similar.  It started with a question I had when I saw home prices falling, and stock prices falling in the 1990s.  "Where did the money go?"  I had no idea.  Then I saw the dot com bubble, and it burst, and I looked around to see where the money went, figuring that people sold those stocks and had to park the cash someplace.  Wrong.  Then, in 2005, I saw the housing bubble and determined to "figure out" how the "economy" worked.  "Economics" textbooks turned out to be "junk," mostly.  Also, the "economists" on mainstream media had failed to warn us about the housing bubble, and about the impending 2007/8/9 crash.  I kept searching, and the truth began to appear, piece by piece (like your journey).  Suddenly, for the first time in my life, financial/economic things made sense (and even a lot of politics).
I figured, "everybody will want to know what I discovered!"  Wrong again.  They want to know who is dancing with the starts, and what's the score of the game on TV.  
Still, I do what I can to spread the truth.  I figure that eventually, the number of people who see "reality" will reach a critical percentage, and suddenly EVERYBODY will realize that the Emperor has been naked the entire time.

You are wise.
1. Consider a Trezor "hardware wallet".  
2. Get "registered" at an "exchange" (I have used coinbase, some people hate it, I  don't blame them... there are others.)  
3. Buy a small amount at first.  Don't worry about timing the price - just get "some".  
4. Move some/all from your "exchange" into your "hardware wallet".  
5. Make a backup copy (can be written on paper) of the "pass phrase" your wallet gave you, and store that in an "off site" location - store it SECURELY.  If anybody else sees it, they can take your Bitcoin and it cannot be undone.    The off site back up is in case of fire/flood/etc.

At this time, gold prices are manipulated (paper gold, etc)..  Anyhow...
Here's the deal, the next recession will be the end of "money" as most people have come to know it; the next financial downturn will kill fiat currencies, even the USD.
The global financial system "died" in 2007/8, but was put on "life support" (Quantitative Easing, Zero (or nearly zero) percent interest rates, bailouts for insolvent banks and even some insolvent businesses...  The global financial system is still on "life support" to this day.  
The central banks have openly admitted, it's QE forever, from now on.  The global pile of debt too huge.  You can't "print" prosperity.

People who make such claim against Bitcoin are ignorant.
For example, the US Dollar has very little or no intrinsic value: most USD exists only in digital form, in bank ledgers.  Somehow this is not a problem for the ignorant nay sayers.   For them, it's only a problem for Bitcoin.  They're idiots.
Gold has some intrinsic value: it can be made into electrical wire, foil, jewelry, teeth... Still, gold's intrinsic value is on par with aluminum.  Almost all of gold's current price has to do with it's scarcity and difficulty to produce.
Meanwhile, when people trade/exchange things with intrinsic value, it's called "barter" and no money is involved.
You see, the whole IDEA behind "money" is to have something with little or no intrinsic value to stand in place of other "wealth" - a sort of general purpose IOU.  Such IOUs should be durable, divisible, fungible, portable, recognizable, rare/scarce, and difficult to counterfeit.  The US Dollar, along with all major fiat currencies in use today, fails: they are easily "counterfeited" by the central bankers.  Those bankers create trillions of "IOUs" by merely typing numbers into their computers.  Bitcoin, and gold, on the other hand, have ALL of the properties of good money enumerated above.
When people start talking about "intrinsic value," you can know:
 \* they don't understand "money" (most people don't)
 \* they don't understand the fiat currency they use every day
 \* they have no clue about Bitcoin
 \* they're dumb enough to go around "attacking" something they don't even understand
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:04:57
Consider explaining "bank" something like this...
Long ago, people used gold for money.  Gold was a good form of money, as it couldn't be printed - it had to be mined, it was extremely rare.  But gold was difficult and expensive to store securely.  Besides being heavy, it was dangerous to carry around with you.  Meanwhile, the local goldsmith had good 24-hour security -- he HAD to have that.  People found it convenient to store their gold savings with the local goldsmith.  The goldsmith would give each depositor a Note, a receipt for their deposit.  Eventually, people would trade those Notes instead of the gold itself.  So far, so good.  Each note was backed by an amount of gold, in the goldsmith's vault.  Those Notes were "good as gold".  
Thus, the goldsmith became an early kind of bank.  This worked, but the goldsmiths soon figured out that they could lend other people's gold, and charge interest.  As long as they didn't loan out too much gold, nobody would catch them.  Fractional reserve lending was born.  But some goldsmiths got too greedy and/or careless - they got caught.  When word got out, people would literally RUN to their "bank" to get their gold out, while the goldsmith still had some...
Eventually, the bankers stopped pretending that the money was backed by gold, or anything at all.  This worked for a little while, until it didn't.  Fortunately, right about that time, Bitcoin had been invented!

First, thanks for editing, keeping it moving, staying on topic, and keeping it relatively short.
The background music?  Just me: I find it distracting.  Still, not a big deal.
How to make Bitcoin fit either of those two theories?  To me, that's backwards.  In science, your theory needs to match observable/measurable reality -- but most modern economists are not scientists, don't understand money, and don't even know what science really is, which is sad since people who major in that subject tend to have decent brain power.
You, being a member of the Austrian school moves you to the "front of the class" as far as I'm concerned.

Supply and demand.  
The rate of growth in Bitcoin supply is predetermined, and changes very slowly relative to changes in demand.  
Thus, price is determined by demand.  
Demand goes up, price goes up, but supply remains stable and the production rate stays the same.  
With gold, for example, demand goes up, price goes up, production rate of gold goes up.  This is not the case with Bitcoin.  The production rate is not dependent upon price.

A pyramid scheme pretends to be an investment.  It has a person or small group who run it.  They take "deposits", and then start sending dividends, pretending that they invested those deposits, and made money.  But they didn't invest any of it; the dividends are just part of what was deposited.  The rate of return is unusually high, so this makes people greedy for more - they invest more and they get their friends and families to invest more.  The scam eventually runs out of new suckers and collapses.
Bitcoin is a new kind of money.  Bitcoin works just fine without any new "investors".  Bitcoin has been around ten years - the price has gone up, AND DOWN.  You'd never see a Ponzi/Pyramid scam where the value of the "shares" goes down.  Also, Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends.
Your homework: learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works (Read "The Bitcoin Standard."), then learn how fiat money works and what a Ponzi scheme / Pyramid scam is -- then  you can explain it better to whomever.

 Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?
A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Ponzi schemes are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new participants.
Bitcoin is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollar, euro, yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads to volatility where owners of bitcoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Bitcoin is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses.

From the Finder, the top menu bar should have a "Go" item.  Under that you'll see "Utilities".
In the Utilities folder you should see something called "Terminal".  Double click that.  Welcome to 1972: command line Unix.  Don't be scared.
You're going to run a command, you'll have to either copy it from here, then paste it into your command line, at the prompt, or type it in.
There is the "find" command, which will go looking for files.  
Then there is the "grep" command, which will look inside files for a matching pattern of characters (your public key).
We will "pipe" the output of one into the other.  So, you want to tell the operating system, essentially, "find every file on this hard disk, then pass the name of that file into this other command which will look for my public key inside the file's contents -- and when it finds it, print out the path to that file."
Below, I'll give you the command, but you'll have to replace 'yourKeyGoesHere' with your actual key: 19Pd897... or whatever it is.  It might take several minutes, or even an hour to run.  You'll see a lot of messages like "find: /.Trashes: Permission denied" and that's normal.  It's going to write the "answer" to a file called /tmp/hopeful.
    grep -l yourKeyGoesHere `find / ` &gt; /tmp/hopeful
That's a "minus el".  Notice, those are not apostrophes, but "back quotes" (probably found in the upper left corner of your keyboard).
You'll see the warnings.  Eventually it stops and you see the prompt again.
Run this:
    cat /tmp/hopeful
If you find the private key, don't let anybody see it, don't post it here.

If you ever do study economics, study Austrian Economics.  In fact, a great place to start is to read, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.  He will teach you about money (and makes it kind of fun/interesting), and then he will teach you why Bitcoin is the best money ever.
As for the day-to-day use of Bitcoin (or lack, thereof), there is this phenomenon described by Gresham's law, where people who have access to two kinds of money will spend the crappy money while hoarding the good money.  So, the fact that people are reluctant to spend their precious Bitcoins is evidence that it's better than the fiat currencies.
Also, if a person spends their Bitcoins, they miss out when the price goes up, up, up...  If they spend and replenish, then they're paying a lot of fees  to their exchange, and they might be incurring taxes (and tax preparation complications).

To really appreciate Bitcoin, you need to understand what it actually is, and the very basics of how it works.  You also need to understand money, the history of it, how it works, the different types of money...  The Ammous book goes through all of that.

So, let's say you spend a big chunk of your precious time clicking on ads in FB to earn some amount of their "coin".  And then FB keeps devaluing their coin via inflation.  But somehow, that's okay, because, I don't know, because you're stupid, got D grades in math, etc.
But then one day, you mention "Louis Farrakhan" in a comment, because he made a spot-on video about how evil the central bankers are.  POOF!  You FB account is suspended, by a "robot", and all your stupid FB "coin" for dumbfucks is GONE, poof, just like that.

Or, there's an election, and you say something they don't like about one of the candidates -- poof -- you're locked out and your "coin" goes bye-bye.

Buy a high quality, six-sided die.  
Buy a Raspberry Pi (R-Pi).  Connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse.  Boot it up.  
Connect R-Pi to the Internet.  Go to   
Wiggle the mouse until you get to 100%  
**DISCONNECT THE R-Pi from the Internet and NEVER connect it again.**  
In the green area near the top of the page, click "Wallet Details".  
At the bottom of the Wallet Details page, find and click where it says, "How do I make a wallet using dice?"  Read that.  Understand it.  Roll one die... count the dots... if you roll 6 dots, use "0" (zero).  
Roll your die 99 times, writing down the digit \[0-5\] for each roll.  Roll it "randomly" - for example, put it into a jar, put your hand over the top, shake the jar with vigor for about five seconds, then dump the die into a box or something.  Do that 99 times.  Record the numbers.  Make sure you have exactly 99 numbers.
Disconnect the R-Pi from the Internet, if you haven't already.  Never connect it again.
Carefully enter the numbers you rolled into the long text area at the top of the web page, where it says, "Enter Private Key".  Click "View Details".
Scroll down, find where it says, "Private Key WIF".  Below that is a QR code.  Below the QR code is your totally random Private Key.  Congratulations!
You're not finished yet.  Calm down.
Write down your private key, very carefully, very clearly.  Label it "private".  
Double check it, very carefully, against what the R-Pi browser shows.
Write down the corresponding public address (scroll up a bit, where it says, "Bitcoin Address").  Write it on the same paper with the private key.
Double check the private key **again**.  Face it: if you fuck up, your BTC will be gone.  So, don't fuck up.  
Take a moment to think of 1 BTC buying what $1 million buys today.
Then double check that you wrote down at least one more time.  
Then write a **second copy** of your private key and public address on a second piece of paper.  Double check two or three times.
**On a different computer**, go to [ but add your **PUBLIC** address.  Read the PUBLIC address from the paper you just wrote it on, and type it very carefully after the ...address/   in the address bar.  Press "return".  Make sure there's no error.  If there's an error, you're not being careful enough -- have two cups of coffee and start over at the die-rolling step.
Double check the PUBLIC addresses you wrote on the two papers.  They must match each other and match the public address displayed on the R-Pi.
Now - erase the die-digits where the browser says, "Enter Private Key".  This time, very carefully enter the private key from your first paper into that text area.  Click "View Details".  You should see the **exact same** PUBLIC key you wrote on your paper (and no error messages).  If not, start over at the die-rolling step.
Then, erase, the private key you entered.  Get your **second** paper, the copy, carefully enter that private key, click "View Details," and verify you get the exact same PUBLIC address.
**Put each paper copy in a ziploc baggie.**  Store each copy in a secure hiding place - **in two separate locations in case of fire/flood/etc.**  Think like a criminal who knows you're on vacation for a week - where would he look?  Don't hide it there.  You're going to have to be ultra-creative.
Email a copy of the PUBLIC address to yourself.  Keep a copy in your wallet, or safe.  Don't store your private key in your wallet, on your phone, in your other computer, or in any safe.
**Remember: NEVER connect that R-Pi to the Internet, EVER again.  Don't do it.**
The next safest way is to buy a hardware wallet from the original manufacturer, generate a 24-word phrase, then write that down, twice, ... ziplocs, ...hiding places in two locations in case of fire/flood.

@_date: 2019-05-11 02:10:04
Easy.  Use an old computer which never gets used, or buy something cheap, like a Raspberry Pi -- but NEVER connect it to the Internet again.
No need for a printer.  Just write the private and public keys on paper.  Two papers, so you have a back up, then store the back up "off site".
Double/triple check what you've written down (not hard to do).

Our financial system is currently set up to punish savers and to reward debt slavery.
For example, people think the mortgage interest deduction is a good deal.  Let's examine the facts.  A person might pay $30K in mortgage interest and get $7 or $8K "back" when they file their taxes.
I'll do better than that.  Give me that $30K and I'll give you $16K back -- double what the government offers, AND, I won't make you wait until next April, I'll give you your $16K immediately.  What a deal!  I mention this to show that the average schmuck is, sadly, pretty clueless about money (and math, in general).  I also mention it to show that people are a lot more brainwashed than they realize.  I know I am, and I hardly watch any TV.
So, people get lulled into the idea that you just "gotta" go into debt to get ahead.  That's so backwards!
Having said that, is it easy to get out of debt?  No!  But it's worth it.  How do I know?  I've done it, more than once.  You have to be able to say, "no," to yourself (and a few others along the way).  That's not easy with all the ways to spend money, and the ease with which a person can go into debt.
People get lulled into going into debt in order to "keep up" with people around them who are also going into debt in order to "keep up" with people around them who are going into debt...
When people go into debt, they give up a certain amount of freedom, and they make criminal bankers even richer.

Please remember: there is money, then there is actual wealth.  Money, by design, has little or no "intrinsic value".

Right now we have a small group of people (about 19 in the US) with the sole ability to legally create all the fiat currency they want (USD, in the case of the Federal Reserve).  Globally, since about 2007/8, central banks have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their central bank "play money" (fiat currency).   
Why call it "play money"?  Because it is created from thin air, by merely typing numbers into their computer; it is not backed by anything tangible.
When the central bankers create fiat money, they are, in effect, legally "counterfeiting", and "stealing" from the rest of us.  That is, they use the new money to buy actual stuff, actual wealth (things like real estate, stocks, commodities, yachts, gems, precious metals, private jets, fur coats...)  When they do that, they are taking that stuff from the rest of us, without our permission, in an unfair manner -- theft, in other words.
Central bankers have been creating unfathomable amounts of "play money" and using it to enrich and empower (and/or bail out) themselves and their cronies -- at our expense.

Bitcoin is a ledger.
A ledger is a list of transactions.
A transaction is where the owner of one account sends money to another account.
Money has two basic forms: token, and ledger. 
Examples of token money: coins, glass beads, sea shells, cigarettes (in prison)
Examples of ledger money: checking account, bank account, credit card history, Bitcoin
So, Bitcoin is just a long list of transactions where people sent money to each other.
The Bitcoin ledger exists on thousands of computers all over the world.  Those computers keep each other up to date with the latest transactions, so that everybody has the same copy/list of transactions.  Anybody can obtain their own copy.
In a nutshell, the Bitcoin ledger is "protected" from bad people by Bitcoin "miners".  The miners use powerful computers and complicated math to make sure that nobody can spend any Bitcoins unless that person can prove that they own those Bitcoins.  The miners also protect the ledger from other kinds of cheaters.  It works!  It has been working well for over 10 years.

To be fair, the exchanges have one foot in crypto, and the other foot in the fiat/government banking system.  Because of that second foot, they either obey the laws, or get shut down and go to jail.
You're right - this situation just shines a bright light on some of the problems of the fiat/government banking system.  They can, and do tell us where, when, and to whom we can send THEIR fake money.  We are forced to give up privacy, while criminal bankers get to "hide" their evil deeds.

Digital signatures.
**Summary:**  
You start with two "keys" which are mathematically related, and a message.  
One key is private, the other key is public.  
You plug the private key (a big number) and your message into a formula, and the formula spits out a signature (another big number).  Anybody can check/verify the signature by plugging the original message and the PUBLIC key into another formula - which spits out a "yes" or "no".

Some thoughts, in no particular order:
Hopefully, those puppets will declare "war" on Bitcoin.  Let's look at the US track record for "wars": 
* War in Korea.  Stalemate.
* War against poverty.   Losing.
* War on drugs.  Losing.
* War on terror.  Losing.
* War in Vietnam.  Lost.
* War in Iraq.  What a fucked up mess we made there.






Meanwhile, central banks around the world are stuck at zero percent.  The Federal Reserve was at/near zero percent for about ten years.

Their **only** power comes from the fact that they and they alone are allowed to "counterfeit" ("print", create from thin air) as many US Dollars as they want.
They create money from nothing, backed by nothing, then use it to acquire actual wealth (stocks, land, resources, intellectual property, bonds, yachts, private jets, etc.).  This is a form of theft.  They've been stealing from the rest of us.

Most gold investments are merely on paper, that is, the investor does not have possession of the physical gold.  There are many ounces of paper gold for every ounce of physical gold.
Meanwhile, some of the physical gold is not solid gold - some of it has tungsten inside.
Physical gold is expensive to store and transport securely.
Physical gold sets off metal detectors, and can be taken by force.
Bitcoin does not have these problems.

Basically, Bitcoin is a ledger.  Similarly, every bank account, every checking account, every credit card account, etc. -- all just ledgers.
A ledger is an ordered list of transactions.
A transaction is where somebody sent an amount of money from one account to another.
Simple, huh?
Unlike your checking account, the Bitcoin ledger is public, stored on many thousands of computers all over the world, and immutable (nobody can edit/change transactions after the fact).  Meanwhile, your checking account ledger is kept on the bank's computer(s) -- hopefully they keep good backups.  The bank ledger is hidden/private.  The bank can go in and change transactions, after the fact.
Any computer that wants to use the Bitcoin ledger to send a transaction must follow the rules, or the other computers will just ignore it.  The immutability of the ledger is protected by specialized computers called "miners" -- there are thousands and thousands of them working very hard, round the clock, 24/7/365.  They protect the ledger using special math.  To motivate the miners, "coins" are issued about 6 times per hour (like a jackpot) - these are the "Bitcoins," or money.
The math and computer "agreement" between the entire Bitcoin community do things like:
\* Preventing somebody else from spending your money
\* Preventing you from spending more than you have
\* Preventing the government from confiscating your money
Bitcoin is one of the most important things ever invented: right up there with fire, wheels, forged metal, agriculture, gunpowder, printing presses, and digital computers.

Tell them, "It's just like your checking account - a ledger.  In case of your checking account, the bank keeps the ledger in their computer(s).  In the case of Bitcoin, copies of the ledger are spread around the world on thousands of computers - anybody who wants one can obtain a copy of it.  In the case of your checking account, the bank enforces the rules.  In the case of Bitcoin, thousands of computers work together to enforce the rules."
Points to drive home: they're already using something similar to Bitcoin.  They're already using "digital money" (and don't even realize it).  They're already using money with "no intrinsic value".  They're already using money that consumes electricity.

Once you understand "money", you'll understand the different forms of money and **what makes some forms of money MUCH better than others**.  It's not complicated (I found it fun to read...)

Your final paragraph: beautiful!






So, instead of a ledger of transactions, where one account sends "money" to another account, we'd have an immutable list of "posts/comments".  Great.  We could have miners using proof-of-work to mine blocks of comments.  The miners need to be motivated to spend resources (equipment, electrical power, floor/rack space, time and effort).  So, there would need to be some sort of "coin" reward for solving the next block in the longest chain of blocks.  Instead of transaction fees, posters could pay the same thing, with a different name, as a "tip" for the miners... but then it would cost "money" to get your "voice" heard in a timely manner, and that's not fair -- soon, only a few relatively wealthy entities would be able to afford to have their comments added to the list of comments;  that would be bad.  
At the same time, if there is no cost to post whatever you want, and once posted, it can never be erased, then some people are going to write little programs to keep posting the same garbage over and over and over; that would be bad.
I don't have a solution.   Perhaps others can pick up where I left off and find a way to make it work, because, that would be good.

The closest thing you can get to "proof" is having a few "confirmations" for your particular transaction.
Remember: transactions get bundled into blocks, by miners.  A block gets solved by a miner, then added to the chain of blocks.  When your transaction makes it into a solved block, it gets its first confirmation.  As more blocks are solved and linked to your transaction's block/chain, your transaction gets more confirmations.
Until you get a confirmation, your transaction is sitting in a "waiting room" and, as mentioned, could become part of a double-spend.

Gold is heavy.  Gold takes up space (not much, but some).  Gold registers on metal detectors.
Bitcoin has no weight, takes up no space, cannot be detected.
Gold is tangible, you can see it, feel it, measure it.
Bitcoin is a ledger spread across many devices around the world, you can't touch or see a physical Bitcoin.  Bitcoin usage requires an Internet connection, hardware, etc. which implies electrical power.  (The electrical power in a given location might be disrupted, but your Bitcoins still exist, and you'll regain the ability to "use" them once the power has been restored, or once you've moved to a region where there is electrical power and Internet connectiviity available.)
A possible strategy, therefore, might include:
* Bitcoin
* Gold coins
* Silver coins
* Toilet paper
* Non-perishable food
* Mobility

In that case, Welcome to Bitcoin.
I'd like to encourage you to spend a little time here and there to learn what Bitcoin actually is.
For example, it's a Ledger.  A ledger is just a list of transactions.  A transaction is where somebody sends an amount of "money" from one address to another.  The ledger is publicly available.  Everybody is free to broadcast transactions to everybody else who is keeping a copy of the ledger.
If you have a checking account, bank account, paypal account, or credit card, you've already been using "ledger money".
Here's one very important thing about that ledger: it is immutable, thanks to the miners.

That's interesting.  Good post.
Still, most people most of the time don't have a problem with the delay of transferring money, or having a check clear.  It's like Bitcoin solves a problem that rarely exists.
The much bigger problem that it exists, which Bitcoin solves, is at this time largely unappreciated.  That problem is this: we have a small group of people who have the sole ability to create all the "money" they want, from thin air, backed by nothing. When they do that, they end up stealing actual wealth from the rest of us.  Compared to the recent "theft" of many tens of trillions of USD in actual wealth, having to wait a day or two for a money transfer or a check to clear is insignificant.
Look at Venezuela.  People are literally tossing their now-worthless "bank notes" into the street.  Can that happen "here"?  Yes.  And it eventually will.  Similarly, look at Zimbabwe, Hungary, the Wiemar Republic (1920's Germany), etc.
Do you suppose the people in Venezuela are right now more concerned about:
 \* their inter-bank transactions not being "instant" (real time)
 \* their savings and earnings being literally wiped out

1. Get out of debt, stay out of debt
2. Save an emergency cash cushion so you don't become homeless/hungry if you lose your job, for example.
3. Buy a small amount of Bitcoin.  Hold onto it.  Do not "day trade" with it.  Do not buy other "crypto" - only buy Bitcoin (find out why, later...)
4. Do not invest money you might need within the next year or two.  Do not invest money you can't afford to completely lose.
5. Do not invest heavily in things you don't understand.  Thus: start learning:
   1. What Bitcoin actually **is**
   2. The basics of how Bitcoin works
   3. When and why Bitcoin was invented
   4. The basics of "money", it's various forms, some history, what makes one thing better money than another
6. After learning all that, you're ready to invest heavily
To learn all that, start by reading, "The Bitcoin Standard," by S. Ammous.  Also, watch every Andreas Antonopoulos video you can find.

You might consider opening your Coinbase account (or some other exchange) sooner than later, as it can take several days, a few weeks to get everything in order so you can make your first "exchange" from fiat to Bitcoin.
Oh - Welcome to Bitcoin!
It's safe enough to buy a non-large amount (few hundred bucks) and let it sit at the exchange for a few weeks until you're comfortable using your private wallet.
Send a small amount (0.005 BTC) to yourself.  Watch the transaction get confirmed (that's actually pretty cool)...  a site like:  
...where you would put in your wallet PUBLIC address (never give out your private key) and watch the transaction appear and then get more "confirmations" every ten minutes (on average).
Maybe send a very small amount to a friend who already has a wallet, or make a small donation.
Once you're comfortable that you can send Bitcoin to your own wallet, and see the balances change, etc. then move larger amounts.  The idea is to minimize risk.  We all make mistakes.  Try not to make a $23,000 mistake...
So, while you're waiting for the exchange (Coinbase) to do all the b.s. they need to do, you can learn about wallets, get one, etc.  ... ask questions.  Stuff like that.

Meanwhile, the central bankers have hoarded hundreds of tons of gold.  Yes, tons, as in 2000 lb per ton.
The people who create and control fiat currencies know better than to trust fiat currencies.  They trust gold, not each other, and not each other's "play money".
Meanwhile, governments cannot stop Bitcoin any more than they can:  
 * win their "war on poverty"  
 * achieve peace in the middle east  
 * win the  "war on drugs"  
 * win the "war on terror"  
 * balance a budget  
 * prevent a hurricane  
 * enforce "prohibition" to keep people from drinking booze  
They can pass their laws.  Some will comply.  Others will pretend to comply.  Still others will openly disobey in defiance.  The booze will flow.  The dope will be smoked.  The poverty goes on and on.  The Bitcoins will be mined and spent.
Laws are local.  Bitcoin is global.

Bitcoin has a few significant advantages over physical gold.  Bitcoin costs very little to store and to transport securely.  Bitcoin doesn't set off metal detectors.  Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up no space.
Bitcoin has the disadvantage of not being a physical object you can touch and see... some people get hung up on that.
Still, my first reply to this thread is specifically about giving USD to a "brokerage house" and they SAY they're buying BTC and holding it for you, when they're not.  So, when the shit hits the fan (not if, but when), a lot of people are going to find out the hard way that they've been scammed.  In the meanwhile, since those crooks will be able to create their "paper Bitcoin" from thin air, at no cost, it won't increase the demand for real Bitcoin -- if anything, it could decrease demand for the real thing.
Remember "supply and demand"?  If the supply remains relatively constant and demand drops (because fools are rushing to buy the fake "paper Bitcoins" with their pre-tax dollars), what happens to the price?  Hint: it doesn't go up.  Not while that's going on.
But when the SHTF, things like physical gold, silver coins, real Bitcoin, guns, bullets, canned food, bottled water, etc. will become "priceless".

Here are a few things where Artigas gets it wrong:
He starts off with an argument which goes something like, "gold is traditional, therefore it's automatically better."  No, he doesn't say it quite like that, but he implies it -- the old, "but we've always done it that way".
For example, when computers were still a new thing, a lot of accounting was done by hand, with adding machines.  Clearly, computers with databases and/or spreadsheets and/or custom software is light years ahead of paper-pencil, or even adding machine technology.  To say the the older technology is better because it's been around a long time is a fallacy.  So, Artigas used a fallacy.
Then he blunders again.  He says that gold is better than Bitcoin because it has other uses, like jewelry, electronics.  The fact is, gold has extreme value because it is scarce and easily recognizable.  If gold was not scarce, it's price per ounce would be about on par with aluminum, for example -- those two metals share a large number of physical properties (being soft, malleable, conducting electricity, etc.)  Gold and lead have similar physical characteristics (soft, dense, good for shielding).  Apparently, Artigas the gold salesman doesn't understand his own product.
Recap: Gold is valuable because it is scarce, not because you can make electrical wire from it.
Note: Bitcoin is even scarcer than gold.
Artigas blunders again.  This time, he brings up price and price volatility.  This is how people who don't know what Bitcoin actually is look at it: just some "thing" with a price that goes up and down -- they have no understanding.  I'd suggest to Artigas to spend more time learning what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works, and the reasons it was invented, and less time running his mouth, which is mostly filled with nonsense and his lack of understanding.
Good money has all of the following properties:
* Durable
* Divisible
* Portable
* Fungible
* Recognizable
* Scarce
* Difficult to counterfeit
Gold has all of them, and thus, is a good form of money.
Bitcoin also has all of them.
Notice that, "being used in electronics/jewelry" is NOT on that list.
Meanwhile: Gold is heavy and takes up space.  Bitcoin takes up no space, weighs nothing.
Gold is expensive to store securely and/or transport securely.  Bitcoin is inexpensive to store and transport securely.  
Gold sets off metal detectors, can be and has been confiscated by governments.  Bitcoin cannot be "detected".  Bitcoin cannot be taken by force.

There are basically two kinds of money:
* Token (coins, glass beads, sea shells, etc.)
* Ledger (bank account, checking account, credit card, Bitcoin, etc)
Bitcoin is a ledger.  The ledger is a list of transactions.  A transaction is somebody sending an amount of Bitcoin from one address to another.
Where is that ledger?  There are copies on many thousands of computers spread across the planet.
How does the ledger get updated?  It is not possible to alter the history, that is, prior transactions are permanent.
To change "history", you'd need the cooperation of at least 51% of the participants -- which would destroy the value of their Bitcoin investments.  So, that's not going to happen.
New transactions are added to the ledger by broadcasting to all the nodes who are listening for such.  If the transaction is invalid, those nodes are programmed to reject/ignore it.
Now, please ask your friend to explain how ONE person is going to change the ledger on 10,000+ computers spread across the globe.  He won't, because he can't.
Another way to explain it to your friend:
\* your checking account is just a ledger, kept in the bank's computer
\* all checking accounts are just ledgers, kept in bank computers
Can ONE person take everybody's checking account?  No.
Neither can one person take everybody's Bitcoin.

Refugees prefer Bitcoin.  
I have known several people who fled from other countries.   When they fled, they had to leave everything behind, except for what they could carry.  Gold is heavy, takes up space, and can be detected.  Bitcoin weighs nothing, takes up no space, and cannot be detected.  If those people had owned Bitcoin, they'd have been able to keep their "money" before, during, and after their escapes.  If those people had owned significant amounts of gold, they'd likely have been robbed along they way.
In one case, the guy had to swim across a big river.  It's kind of hard to swim and carry much gold.

So, if you're thinking that bringing the Wall Street criminal gang into the mix is going to drive the price of Bitcoin up, think again -- look at how they've been openly manipulating the prices of gold and silver through rehypothecation.
To combat them, we need to educate people and emphasize the truth, "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."  If somebody is selling you "paper Bitcoins," you're being scammed.

First, if you own only one home, to live in, it doesn't matter if the price goes up, in general, because if you sell it, you'll need to buy another home to live in, and the price of that home will have gone up, too.  
Still, another thing that gets overlooked by these "housingheads" is that real estate has very significant "holding costs," including, but not limited to:
* Mortgage interest
* Property taxes
* Insurance
* Maintenance
Meanwhile, Bitcoin has no holding costs.  Zero.
Furthermore, along the lines of "a fortress soon becomes a trap, real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes.  Real estate is not portable.  If the government turns Socialist, they might just confiscate your real estate.
Bitcoin hodlers don't have such problems; they just need to keep their private key(s) secure.

Both gold and Bitcoin are forms of "good" (hard) money.
Gold has certain advantages:
 \* tangible, touchable, visible
 \* long, long tradition
Gold has certain disadvantages relative to Bitcoin:
 \* heavy
 \* takes up space
 \* difficult, expensive to store securely
 \* difficult, expensive, and slow to transport securely
 \* sets off metal detectors
 \* has been confiscated by government in he past
 \* is likely to be confiscated again
 \* is easier to counterfeit (tungsten-filled bars/coins, for example)

The US Dollar is so wonderful that they have to hire men with guns to FORCE people to use it.
Meanwhile, US Dollar hegemony is doomed with or without Bitcoin.  China, Russia, India, Iran, Venezuela, etc.  They're all ditching the dollar and creating their own International settlement systems.  They've been doing this for nearly 10 years.  Why?  Because the US Dollar is dishonest, corrupt, and essentially worthless.  In many non-US countries, the government, central bank, and/or citizens have been stockpiling hundreds of tons of gold.
Hundreds of tons.
Meanwhile, Rep. Brad Sherman just told the entire world how to better undermine the Federal Reserve System and the US Dollars they create from thin air: Use Bitcoin.

Good money has all of the following properties:  
 * Durable  
 * Portable  
 * Divisible  
 * Fungible  
 * Recognizable  
 * Scarce / rare  
 * Difficult to counterfeit / create  
Gold has all 7 properties.  So does Bitcoin.  Fiat currencies (USD, Euro, Yen, Pound, etc.) are not difficult to create (counterfeit) -- for example, a central bank can create as much "money" from thin air, backed by nothing as they choose, and then use that new money to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  Since 2007 or so, central bankers around the world have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat currency "play money".  They don't even have to print boxcars full of it, they just type a few numbers into their bank's computer, and -poof- new money.  This amounts to theft and leads to hyperinflation and eventually to currency collapse.
Bitcoin is immune to that.  The creation of new Bitcoin was determined from the very beginning and follows a specific schedule which no central banker can alter.

1. Using [bitaddress.org]( is good, however it is recommended to get a copy of their javascript (and html) onto a computer which is not, and never will be connected to the Internet (just to be extra paranoid).
2. Sending your private key(s) to a printer can expose you to risk.  If the printer uses wifi, for example.  If somebody else accesses your printer (say, you recycle it), your information (private keys) might still be inside that printer somewhere.  You can write down your private key(s).  Then, later, (but before sending Bitcoin to them), type what you wrote down into the bitaddress page to verify that you did not make any mistakes.  Again: double, triple, quadruple check that you wrote the private key(s) correctly.  Be sure to make two copies and store them securely, but in separate locations in case of fire/flood/etc.
3. Either use strong encryption, or don't store anything in any public place.  This merely makes your job more difficult because you have to keep track of where you stored your key(s) and the password you used to encrypt it... might as well just keep track of your two written copies of the private key(s).
4. Consider using a hardware wallet and storing pass phrases in two locations (securely)

The USD is not "pegged" or "tied" or "backed" by anything.  You are just plain wrong to state otherwise.
The USD was once backed by gold, and before that, silver.  Now, it is backed by nothing tangible.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  For example, what is gold backed by?  Nothing.
Yet gold and Bitcoin each have all seven of the properties necessary for "good" money:  
 * Durable  
 * Divisible  
 * Portable  
 * Recognizable  
 * Fungible  
 * Scarce/rare  
 * Difficult to counterfeit/produce  
The USD is not scarce and is not difficult to counterfeit/produce.  USD is created from thin air when loans are made within the fractional reserve banking system.  Even worse, USD is created from thin air by the central bank (the "Fed"), by merely typing numbers into their computer system.
THAT is what is meant by "not tied to anything".  The USD is "play money".  Bitcoin is not.  Neither is gold.
You don't understand Bitcoin, because you don't even understand money.  But, you seem smart, so, hopefully you'll make it a point to learn.  If not, you'll just go around being "wrong" and eventually suffer the consequences.

"*Stocks edged higher today on reports that the GDP of Greenland grew 1.7% in the third quarter, more than analysts had predicted...*"  Bullshit.  Stocks went up because central banks created money from thin air and "lent" it to their crony-buddies at/near zero percent, and those buddies ran down to Wall Street to get rid of that worthless fiat by using it to purchase something a bit more tangible.
Most of the mainstream media just happens to be owned by those same bankster-buddies.  They stooges like Warren Buffett to go on camera and lie through their teeth.  It's all part of manufacturing consent.

You are mistaken.  Nobody is pegging Bitcoin against any currency, nor is any currency being pegged against Bitcoin.
 What Is a Currency Peg?
A currency peg is a country or government's exchange rate policy whereby it attaches, or links, the [central bank]( rate of exchange to another country's script. Also referred to as a [fixed exchange rate]( or a pegged exchange rate, a currency peg stabilizes the exchange rate between countries. Doing so provides long-term predictability of exchange rates for business planning and can anchor rates at advantageous levels for large importers.

Sherman, is owned and operated by the "Fed".
The Fed has the sole ability to create as many USD as they want, from thin air, backed by nothing tangible.  They no longer need to "print" boxcars full of bank notes, like in 1920s "Germany".  No.  Now, they merely type numbers into their computer, and brand new US Dollars are created - just like that.  (Compare and contrast that to how Bitcoin is created, or how new gold coins/bars are mined, processed, minted...)
When the Fed (or any central bank / government) creates new fiat currency, they are stealing.  They are "counterfeiting".  It happens to be technically legal in their case, but it is still stealing. 
Sherman, is owned and operated by thieves, organized "criminals".  But those crooks are afraid of Bitcoin now because when we all use Bitcoin, they won't be able to merely "print" all the Bitcoin they want, from nothing, to bail out themselves and their cronies.

There is no one fixed number that is appropriate in all situations.
For example, if a person put 10% of their net worth into Bitcoin at $400 per BTC, that BTC has gone up 20 times relative to fiat and now is likely to be 65 to 70 percent of that person's net worth.  
Should they have sold their BTC as the price went up, to keep it at 10%?  With perfect hindsight, we can say, "No!"
When that person first started buying Bitcoin, would it have been prudent to put 70% of their net worth into Bitcoin?  Not really.

I have to admit, not too long ago I thought about stone tools being used as "money" in the really, really early days.  So, I was delighted to see the image of "the first bitcoins".  But then, I thought, those stone tools, for those people, at that time, had an incredibly high "intrinsic value".
Yes, they were also scarce, portable, recognizable, difficult to counterfeit/create.  These are 4 of the 7 properties of good "money".
Meanwhile, stone tools are not divisible or fungible.  Break one in half?  Kind of loses some value.  I'm sure some were better than others.
Not sure about durability.
So... I have to be an asshole, and say, "even though I was thinking of stone tools as money just a few days ago, they're not really money."
Again, the 7 properties of good money:
* durable
* divisible
* fungible
* portable
* recognizable
* scarce
* difficult to counterfeit/produce
Stone tools/arrow heads have some, but not all of the properties.  Still, they DO have tremendous intrinsic value (or did when they were made).  Thus, I would classify them as actual wealth, not "money".
