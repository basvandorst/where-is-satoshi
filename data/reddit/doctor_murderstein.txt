I'm still catching up on everything about bitcoin, but I'm completely retarded still, so forgive me, I'm about to ask stupid questions.
First, I thought the coins on Gox were gone. How can people be buying coins on them now, and what is going on with that?
Second, if you can get mt gox coins, are you doing so in the hope of getting them cheap and finding out the crisis isn't as bad as it seems so far?

Man it is weird and disconcerting to hear things from the 90's referred to as archaic.

That's what I thought. How optimistic you feeling, if you don't mind my asking?

Nice. For now the gox collapse and related events are my only real interest in bitcoin. Wish I'd stuck with mining when I first looked into it. The difficulty was so low a 7770 gpu would fetch almost a coin per week. I had two crossfire setups and could have had them plugging away at it with all 4, but the electricity cost came out to be quite a bit more than the coins were worth at the time.

How much you lose?

Sure thing, officer.

Thought I'd check in again. How's this move looking to have played out now?

No no, I'm not looking to break in or anything silly, I'm trying to gauge whether you think the coins will be back and those will be the payoff or if you think a share of whatever payoff gox might eventually offer up will still be worth more than what they are currently selling for.
Didn't mean to give that impression.
Because I'm seeing people say that the keys are just gone, or never existed, and it's all confusing, but I could easily see people lining up counting on either possibility.
And I'm not an absolute total, total newb. I've got an old wallet on a craptop in my closet, did some gpu mining with 5770's back when they were worth $30, when you sold yours. Wasn't worth the power costs when I did the math so it was just another afternoon of heating up my graphics cards to entertain myself.
Think this was right around the time the story about the kid who gave himself heat stroke from falling asleep in a room with his mining rigs came out.

Would you still need me, would you still feed me, when I'm 64?
