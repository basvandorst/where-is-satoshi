Time to remortgage my house!
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:48:33
Hey, thanks for this, it’s great. Each time bitcoin becomes incrementally more cost-inefficient to mine, how does that affect the price and is that any kind of a useful “dip predictor”?
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:36:58
LOL. Any time anyone tries to educate Trump on anything he just says “I know better than all the specialists.”
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:53:22
What if bitcoin just keeps going up and down forever...kind of like, um, a real currency?
(I mean, once it’s much more well established, a drop from a value of $75,000 down to $70,000 won’t feel like much of a roller coaster anymore. Will it?)
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:48:09
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:50:36
Well this maybe speaks to Bitcoin’s usefulness as a long term investment vehicle. But I don’t know squat.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:50:56
If time travel exists, the big money is in sports betting. And it’s the better way to avoid history-disrupting timeline interferences.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:24:17
This is a wonderful read. I appreciate the time and thinking you put into it. Thank you.
Question: If/When nervous countries ban bitcoin, could that potentially *lift up* the economies of countries that don’t ban it, making them centers of commerce and exchange for world travelers? For example, if a very poor country (let’s call it Bitca) chose to adopt bitcoin, as other countries banned it, might wealthy investors go to Bitca and do lots and lots of exchanging dollars and euros (etc.) for bitcoin and vice versa, thus making Bitca very wealthy as an exchange and brokering place? And wouldn’t this make other countries want to adopt Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:04:16
As I see it (and I’m definitively an utter noob) if BTC goes “all the way down” to $5000, that is great! Because that’s still a pretty pricey price for any regular Joe like myself, and there is already a ton of data showing it WILL go up again. So even if it dips to $5000, tons of regular Joes will buy in. So I say get in and enjoy the ride!
Please critique my logic here, because, as I stated, I’m new to this BTC world.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:00:11
Delighted to know it’s real!
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:24:59
This is kind of what I took away from Mnuchin’s comments, as well.

Does this graph indicate how much each of these large banks have invested in bitcoin? Or how much profit they made on it? I’m unclear because I’m a generally clueless BTC beginner. Can you ‘splain?
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:35:43
May it be as this idiot writer writes. Then we can all buy moooore!

@_date: 2019-07-12 09:14:53
So, based on the statement he just made, I’m guessing he’s trying to get the price of BTC to drop bigly so he and Putin can buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:27:35
Wonderfully clear and informative. I understand and thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:13:05
I figured.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:35:35
The sense that I get is that he knows they can’t really do a whole lot to stop bitcoin, but that they don’t want to let Libra happen without a fight. As with all things Trump, we have to ask, how does slowing Libra down benefit Trump? Trump (or someone really close to him) probably wants to keep bitcoin as the main player on the field.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:43:08
Putin’s got an oligarch for pretty much every kind of hoardable resource.
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:29:47
Jesus. If Bitcoin hits $100K at the end of 2020, will anyone at all, anywhere, be talking about *anything* else?
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:30:29
Is this just a meme or is this a screenshot of an actual app? Either way I love it.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:07:26
I’ve read some advice that says put 2% of your long term investment money into bitcoin and then forget about it. That’s seems a good strategy because losing 2% for most people would make them cry bitterly.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:27:59
When she says “bitcoin is decentralized” and Libra is “centralized and controlled by a corporation” all I hear is the sound “Libra...cha-ching!” from the brains of Republicans.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:34:48
Awesome. Can you use it to help heat your house in winter?
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:46:56
For a second I thought Mnuchin was going to announce a new White House Cryptocurrency. Maybe call it Fuckyoucoin. The actual conference was pretty boring.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:36:59
Time and date, please.
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:38:06
What’s the longest it has remained stable (like, with less than +/- 5% fluctuation) for any given time?
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:48:41
Write it in permanent marker on every mirror in your house.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:29:02
Righto. So, here is my next question: Doesn’t it seem likely that the US and EU would close exchanges and fiat ramps for bitcoin well before the Hodler’s Dream of $100K per bitcoin? I think that the process of lots of regular schmoes becoming rich by investing in bitcoin would scare governments like the US into serious preventative action.
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:11:00
If you’re right, I’ll buy then.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:15:31
Ok. But why and how? Sorry for my endless questions but this is all pretty new to me. Feel free to just post links to articles to read if my questions bore and tire you.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:10:52
How so?
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:11:08
Yeah, that makes sense. I guess the truly rocky and undefined period would be the period between the (current) period of dominance of dollars/euros/etc and the time when bitcoin dominates. It strikes me that only hugely catastrophic “meatworld” events would destabilize national currencies enough to make bitcoin THE major world currency.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:17:51
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:11:37
My understanding is expanding. Thanks to all who explain here!
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:53:45
I generally agree with you, but you might want to consider doing more intensive market research. 1% in the last six months isn’t great investing I think.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:32:26
I’ve read about that too. So Putin (or more likely Putin’s BTC managing team) is probably a whale and he’s delighted to drive the price up and down as he sees fit.
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:38:27
I don’t think it does, exactly. But I think Trump and his pals would like Libra to go as slow as possible because I think they (or their close associates) hold a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:13:36
Similarly, does selling (or converting BTC to USD) at a loss earn you a tax break, like it does with stocks?
@_date: 2019-11-30 07:59:49
Damn I hope you’re right. But that also makes the hardcore case for a cold storage wallet, as I’m sure those 1%ers will definitely break or change any law they want to get as much as they can.
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:01:55
Just like the beginning of BTC, to buy pizza.
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:40:31
I’m sure the smart members of the 1%, and/or their smart money advisors, have invested them in more bitcoin than nearly everyone else by now.
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:58:56
Gosh. That’d be amazing.
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:28:10
 I don’t think of it as a get rich quick scheme. But part and parcel of thinking about it as a “don’t get poor slowly” scheme is knowing that what I’m investing in is becoming less and less subject to “whale whimsy.”
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:18:58
But why on earth would they?!
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:30:30
So you are not a “buy bitcoin at any price” person these days?
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:05:20
I care because I would guess that big institutions and monstrously wealthy people can buy and sell much bigger chunks and influence the rises and dips more, to benefit themselves, especially if two or more entities coordinate their actions and reactions. Meanwhile the little guys just have to “shut up and hodl.”
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:51:34
I think you raise great points. I am by no means claiming higher knowledge on any of this but it does seem that we are a long way away from enough stability with bitcoin for it to be worth using to buy coffee (or anything really). Right now it seems great as a store of value (especially in destabilized, high-inflation countries), but not for regular day-to-day purchases.
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:26:28
Funny writing. Looks like it might be uncomfortably bumpy to some.

@_date: 2019-08-23 17:02:24
Explain what we are to take from this? (I’m new to BTC.)
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:07:31
I am sure that’s right. The dumbness of many alts and the frenzied way people went after them certainly must sting now. But they SHOULD talk about bitcoin. The more people hear about it, the more people enter the world of bitcoin ownership, and the more it becomes a useful tool and an investment vehicle.
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:14:09

Sorry if this has already been asked here before: Why would it be better to buy actual Bitcoin rather than GBTC stock?

That was quick.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:55:37
So you think this is that traditional ten day wave that takes BTC to its highest price ever and your calculation is that the wave began three days ago? Since I’m new to understanding BTC, can you tell me why you calculate that the upswing is “3 days in”?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:07:45
Assuming you are correct, what deep dives do you see BTC taking? I guess I’m asking about buying the dips and what US Dollar amounts bitcoin will fall to on its way up to $50K by the end of the year.

@_date: 2019-06-25 20:20:54
Can you explain that a bit more? I thought GBTC basically *is* a Bitcoin ETF. It’s not?
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:25:44

Your handwriting is close to illegible. Could you re-do and repost?
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:29:25
I get this. And how safe is a Coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:18:28
The massive premium thing kind of makes sense to me. My money goes further when I buy actual bitcoin than when I buy the GBTC stock...but the GBTC stock is backed by actual bitcoin and tethered directly to the price. Whatever I spend to buy GBTC will appreciate or depreciate at pretty much the same rate that Bitcoin itself does. Right?
I hear the “not your keys not your coin argument” and I am not sure I understand it. I don’t see how my brokerage account, to which I can attach any long and complicated password I want, is less secure than an online bitcoin wallet.

Or how about sending your kids to a much less expensive state school, and invest the difference between that and what you would have spent at a pricey private school into a diversified portfolio that includes bitcoin, equities, etc.? Then as part of their university studies they can learn to manage what will be their future holdings (and hodlings).

If you win 8/10 times in Vegas, just do that and invest most of your winnings in a diversified portfolio after every run. Sooner or later you can retire on your winnings. Too bad the online betting is not as consistent because I hate Vegas.

But what? Even if cryptography becomes perfect, isn’t BTC mining limited by time? Or is it like the stock market now where any uncertainty in the system leads to scared selling?
@_date: 2019-09-20 04:39:50
Does that mean 156 satΩshi’s, or 0.00156 of one satΩshi?

Is that the same as “how big does this thing get?”

Very useful! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:06:38
But could a hardware wallet be used to transfer bitcoin to someone else so that it could be used as currency in an emergency situation (assuming you could use a phone to dial someone somewhere and find out the current price of bitcoin)? Like, if I know my wallet has some particular amount of bitcoin, could I use that wallet to transfer some of what I have (just a small portion) to someone else? I obviously don’t know shit about hardware wallets.
