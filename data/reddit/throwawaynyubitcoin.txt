Pretty awesome. It's geared towards people who didn't know much/anything about Bitcoin before coming into the course, so it started with basics like how Bitcoin works and how the U.S. monetary system works
We've had Kashmir Hill (Senior Online Editor at Forbes who focuses on privacy), Barry Silbert (Founder and former CEO of Second Market, current CEO of Bitcoin Investment Trust, and VC invested in over 40 bitcoin-related companies), and Brian Stoeckert (managing director of CoinComply) all come in as speakers so far, and they've all had really valuable perspectives on Bitcoin to share. A few people in the class were involved with Bitcoin before law school as well. We have at least one founder of a Bitcoin related company enrolled and have multiple people who worked at financial regulatory institutions or banks and dealt with bitcoin, so the discussion is always interesting.
**The Professors**
One of the most interesting parts about the course is how the Professors thin about Bitcoin. David Yermack and the Duke professor (I think) are the only two finance professors in the U.S. that are really focusing on bitcoin right now, and I wouldn't be surprised if Geoffery Miller is one of the only Law professors focused on Bitcoin as money rather than Bitcoin as a crime tool.  Prof. Miller does work on financial institutions, where Bitcoin is a hot topic more in white collar crime than in banking circles right now (partly since banks don't touch it).
Prof. Miller thinks bitcoin is very innovative and could very well become a large-scale currency. From a lawyer's perspective, Bitcoin works as well as anything else.
Prof. Yermack thinks Bitcoin is fascinating and wants it to succeed, but is very skeptical it will because of a few factors:
* Transaction Volume - he thinks it should be increasing exponentially if it were to catch on
* Gender and Age disparity in use - He thinks that it if the disparity means that women and the elderly are turned off to Bitcoin, it won't succeed.
* The 10 minute block mining time. I think he doesn't trust verifications that come in before the block is actually mined. He is under the impression that if he buys a coffee the merchant needs to wait 10 minutes to be sure she got her money.
* The transactions per second cap. It's around 7? for Bitcoin and in the 100s of thousands for Visa and Mastercard.
* He's worried that someone (like a terrorist state) can invest only a few hundred million and launch a 51% attack and destroy the entire currency.
Both professors kind of think that eventually, if Bitcoin takes off, the protocol will inevitably be changed to become inflationary. Which is interesting. They think that the Bitcoin issuance cap would be a problem, if they weren't certain that it would be removed upon wide-scale adoption.
They also both think that Alt-coins are basically irrelevant. They think like Facebook or Amazon one will emerge to conquer the market and it is Bitcoin.

I'm currently taking a course at NYU Law called "Law and Business of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies"
It's open to law and business grad students, and I think to other graduate students if they are interested.
