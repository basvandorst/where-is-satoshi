Chikun likes the 0.01-0.02 range, so I think you mean 10-20k...regardless, flap away little chikun to moon lambo

The man is doing it. He really is. Not sure he’s doing it wrong. Stay golden Mr. McAfee.

Oh I think I like this. Makes sense. 
And I don’t know if any of us are really going to see the last BTC (or as close as we can) get mined in our lifetime, so the 21 mil is kinda irrelevant. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:37:12
Then 21
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:30:11
Umm ok. I get it but not sure why 5 mil is relevant in a 21mil system. But what the hell! 4.25 is a good start

Yeah, but he really blew it by not finishing WEX under it. It was right there. What a Hoser. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 03:44:22
Yeah I’m positive it was around 9k. He is doing much better than a lot of folks who got into crypto. Good to see he’s still HODLing. Harold the HODLer. Real MVP. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 01:41:53
Mildly misleading... but thankfully Bitcoin doesn’t care about your grammar or spelling. Just gotta HODL.

“Come exchange with us! Or at least give us your funds and we will decide if we will let you have them back” 
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:10:58
What if you HODL for 5 years and then trade...?
@_date: 2019-12-16 07:06:01
No one here seems to talk about what the miners are going to do with obsolete gear, and decreased hash rate. They won’t be able to keep running gear at a loss. Talk about that please. What do we make of that...? Then worry about your price. Because that will be a large influence on your precious Corn...

It’s more about the fact that Gemini was closing accounts for some large customers that wanted to withdrawal fiat. They wouldn’t let them. This whole stable coin thing is going to FSU mark my words. Stable coins are pegged to USD, which can be printed into oblivion, so eventually they get smart and print millions more and create StableCoins out of thin air, and then exchange it for BTC. Some ponzi suckers stuck bagholding worthless Stables that aren’t even worth what they are backed by. Not to mention what happens when they audit the stable coin, and nothing backing it? And its inflating on the regular to boot. This is the banks and big groups style for the ICOs. Sell people hopes and dreams, then slip it into BTC, and watch the floor fall out. Business as usual. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:44:57
That’s correct. But if price is not 13-14k by then, what’s gonna happen? Do note that these ASICS can mine BCash and SV. Curious how those coins and markets will be affected...

I think you meant, “If we don't study the mistakes of the future, we're bound to repeat them for the first time”.

You da real MVP

If we don’t study the mistakes from the future we’re doomed to repeat them for the first time :(

3 - buy Chikun, IOTA, NEO, and DOGE (obvi)
4 - buy more BTC in the Dip
5 - HODL
6 - Smoke skinny cigarettes
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:09:27
May the doge be worth 100 satoshis once again. Prepare for Olympic moon shot. wow
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:03:58
Any time you leave BTC you sold. Risky move. I played around last spring and should have just HODL’d. That’s what I do now. Buy TRX with new money. HODL and BTFD...seem to be a lot of them lately..,

Go for $200. The future is on sale dude. People piss away $100 at the bar on an average night. So, ride this out, and just HODL. I knew someone who bought 0.5 for $30 back in the day... so get some skin in the game kid.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:09:40
You were born at the right time. Get in. Do your research. Continue to accumulate. This is the future. It’s on sale. Also consider looking at some XMR Monero as it’s focus is privacy. But BTC is king. Try and buy it with cash from someone.

The Future is on Sale^TM
