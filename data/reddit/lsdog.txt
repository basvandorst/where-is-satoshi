its incredibly unlikely this person cares much about short term price movements considering he has held  through the entire *bubble* and selling to fiat near the yearly bottom would make absolutely no sense. the most likely scenario is this person wants dem shitcoinz and xmr

Keeping your coins in a wallet, remembering a few words, scanning a QR code and clicking a few buttons is SO hard dude.. almost as hard as managing 2 pedals, a steering wheel, mirrors and being aware of cars, pedestrians, cyclists and traffic laws.


You must live a pathetic sheltered life. There are many African developers in Crypto, Numerous bitcoin conferences are held in Africa every year, Africans are all over localbitcoins.com; Algeri, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, Nigeria.. and the list goes on. 
Just cause you're a dumb fuck doesn't mean a whole continent is aswell.

your point doesnt stand. today there is 100x more money, people,technological advancements and awareness in crypto. if the variables have changed so will the duration of market cycles, longer bulls and shorter bears. I dont believe the bear market is over but expecting it to last 1.5-3 years is absurd, and its funny how all these idiotic statements come from people with fresh reddit accounts with no crypto experience prior to the recent run.

laugh all you want hahaha, a year ago people preditcing 10k were laughed at and 20k was unimaginable even to the delusional. now, 130k is a measly 6x from ATH. halvening is in 2 years, BTC is finite and will become scarce. your weak insults and ignorance make you look incredibly stupid, and with [posts like this]( im certain you are the bottom selling fool here.

your whining reeks of missing the whole run or worse: selling the bottom - lol. so **bitter**. buy *now* before you become suicidal in a year or two when it hits 130k

whatever floats your boat bud. I'll just add your opinion to the [2018 list]( your predecessors that i've laughed at begin at 2014.
