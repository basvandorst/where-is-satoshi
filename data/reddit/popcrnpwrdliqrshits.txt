I only use GDAX to obtain BTC from USD.
I have not used Exodus so i can't comment. There are many wallets you can choose from and the more complex ones will allow you to set a fee for a transaction (in satoshis/byte).
The more you understand about the space the less you'll have to pay. Check out the following wallets:
Use this site to educate yourself.
This one is important to look at the current state of the mempool and fees.

Good news, not great news. Fees don't change until Q1 2018 :(


Hey who's your payment processor so we can bug them :P

Use the 2nd option. The Coinbase exchange is called GDAX. Place buy limit order to get BTC w/ no fees. Coinbase charges 4% for credit card, 1.5% for bank transfer. Those numbers are insanely high, avoid them. Use 2nd option.
After you get your BTC for 0 fees, purchase a hardware wallet like Trezor or the Ledger Nano S, then transfer your new BTC on GDAX to your new hardware wallet address. Keep that in a safe place. Then HODL those coins (if you're using it to store wealth and not transact).
BTC is not simple yet. You need to invest some time into understanding the environment. Watch lots of Andreas Antonopoulos videos, I'd also suggest IvanOnTech on YouTube.

I use both Binance and Gemini, would recommend.

coinmarketcap.com aggregates market prices from multiple exchanges and it's where many casual users go to see price.
The price is different between exchanges, not usually by much but it increases during periods of high volatility.

Where BTC goes, all others follow (except Dash for some reason)

Not 100% why but you can exploit the slight difference in price between exchanges to profit. This is called arbitrage.

Coinbase has an easy interface which makes them great for beginners. However, they do not seem to be acting in a way that promotes the scalability of Bitcoin because they do not support Segwit (which will reduce tx fees).
I recommend either Gemini or Binance as exchanges.
Transfer USD from your bank to Coinbase USD (this will take 1 week). Then use GDAX to place buy LIMIT orders (place slightly, a few cents, above mkt price, it'll most likely execute cause of volatility) to get BTC w/ 0 fees. Then once you have BTC, transfer to a new exchange on one of the aforementioned if you want to trade more.

When explaining bitcoin I go for the private keychain analogy. I think it works at a lot of levels, personal, you need to keep it safe, etc...

This moron is confusing the Marxist Labor Theory of Value with Proof of Work. He is a moron. Proof of Work has nothing to do with the current price of Bitcoin.

Only a few thousand (all my spare $).
Oh lord what have I done?
A 45% return is what. HODL AND USE THE TECH MY BROTHERS.

I was yelling at my dad about bitcoin, got off the phone, and suddenly NPR. It was a sign. I called him back. I yelled more about bitcoin.

Like Berric Dondarrian it will rise again.
