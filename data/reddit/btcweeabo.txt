Tier 3 still unverified. Been over a week. I’m tier 2 verified though. All exchanges are trash. I’d say Gemini is the best.

Kraken is too fucking slow.
You have to be tier 3 verified for USD withdrawals which suck.
My Kraken deposit took 6 hours to show up even though it was confirmed in 20 minutes on the block chain.
Kraken simply sucks ass.

Any investor with a hint of financial knowledge knows not to invest money they need. :)

The money I invest in my business is money I can't afford to lose. My business has proven to have a reliable ROI so it became my primary investment. Crypto does not have a good track record for stability. Not only is it risky, but it is unstable. I only invest money I am not expecting back a return on, and that is something I don't need to remind a businessman with 30 years of experience (my father).

My dad relates the dot com boom of stocks to crypto. His stocks depreciated almost every time he purchased. He relates crypto to stocks and therefore was skeptical for quite some time.
My firm generates income, my firm has stability, and my firm has predictability. My firm’s success does not depend on the actions of investors around the world. I can have peace of mind knowing my firm has a stable ROI. This is my plan A; a more reliable plan. My plan B would be bitcoin-related; something I am yet to explore in depth.

If you didn’t believe in an investment, why would you even put a single penny? He never was looking to make a high risk investment, and even with my efforts to convince him, I had failed for quite some time. He, however, decided to invest after he had became more educated in the field. It made him more comfortable I guess.

Ok but if you put the two aside: Internet vs Bitcoin.
* Between you and the cloud is an ISP
* ISPs are regulated by the FCC (and can't get away with it without legal trouble)
* FCC's Ajit Pai is a dickhead
* Between you and your money is nothing (hypothetically speaking)
* Its more than just *difficult* to enforce when there is no central authority
* People can send bitcoin through fucking satellites
I think governments are far from regulating Bitcoin as a whole.

What wallet are you using? You can always import your private keys into a *lightweight* client like Electrum.

So long $100.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:12:13
No, thats a centralized model. Bitcoin needs to stay decentralized (which its doing quite well atm). The fact that BCH is dying despite Roger Vers' attempts at promoting it is humorous in itself.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:12:34
Why would he be lying?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:10:00
That would probably be a dangerous move for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:11:16
What dip? Isn't it just stalling at this point.

It means mining is SUPER profitable if the price rises or even stalls. Perfect timing for that new ASIC miner that’s allegedly coming out March.

My point is there are infinite excuses you can make and get away with when it comes to bitcoin. After all there’s no tie to your name or identity.

A lot of these videos are misinforming. Lightning requires an open channel on chain first. I’d love for someone to make an informative explanation and example of the protocol instead of making people think it’s always “instant”.
P.S. I love lightning I just think people need to know how it works .

Its actually missing the "mining" part of it. Methods of which nonces to use, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:11:05
Its how they combat adoption and innovation.

A free fucking haircut? Wow I’m all in
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:27:27
Yes you need a channel or a “link” which hops multiple channels. Its a great idea but not instant until the network is connected and mass adopted. And there are more setbacks like channel limits, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:28:32

A better way to hodl would be to send your BTC in a time-locked transaction .
