I'm at ~3900 in the queue after COB Friday. I was at ~4300 on Thurs, so they are processing ~400/day (without the new hires, I presume).

The lack of chargebacks troubles me as a consumer. How do consumers protect themselves from fraud? Silk Road even requires a somewhat complex third-party escrow/arbitration system. Instead of Verified by Visa, it's Verified by Silk Road.

You don't even need it to deposit fiat - just if you want to deposit a lot of fiat via wire.

Ah.. I can't speak for the EU, so I stand corrected.

That's a good point, ~~but I don't see why no one should have it.~~


What court? Regardless, it's not only theft - or even negligence. What's done cannot be undone. Someone will pay the price, even if it's an accident.

I agree in principle (no need/desire), but technically speaking, forex has already solved the problem you raised. Tokyo opens trading on Monday, and New York closes trading on Friday. Some brokers allow trading over the weekend (Friday night NY to Monday morning Tokyo), but most trading is done within major market hours (Tokyo, London, NY, etc.).

It's in the darker blue are of the UI under "Your wallet"... "Your position in the verification queue".

You raised timezones as a problem, not me. I agreed with you on principle in the first sentence, so who are you arguing with?


False. [Forex is fundamentally decentralized and unregulated]( Trading doesn't literally open and close. Currency can be traded OTC 24/7, much like BTC. [There's just no profit in it.](

Noob Questions: Aren't miners needed to verify transactions? In the long run, will this force transaction fees up as revenue from block rewards goes down?
