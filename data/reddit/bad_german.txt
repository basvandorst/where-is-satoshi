This shouldn't have any bearing on expressing basic human civility.

I guess if is going to be afraid of the security risks of copiers, maybe we can be afraid of regular printers now too.

lolwut. worst story ever.


It was an unusual moment and from what I recall was the elderly man saying, "Here, have this flashdrive with my wallet on it, it has all my Bitcoin and it's your problem now. Stop bugging me about Bitcoin." After this he handed the blonde the flashdrive and walked out of the joint with an exasperated look on his face. She look like she had just won the jackpot and threw the flash drive in her purse and then hurriedly ran out the door.
Granted this could have been Leah McGrath Goodman and Satoshi Nakamoto, or maybe some other blond lady and elderly asian man who was blackmailing her over pornographic pictures or whatnot, but then again I am not so sure. Better to just share this story with no valid proof and see if it sticks. After all it was a public restaurant we were in so there is no harm done in sharing this tale.
