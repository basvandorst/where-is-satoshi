Some time ago I started to think about the intrinsic connection between music and math. As I looked at the graphs of the BTC/USD exchange rate, during my routine technical analysis, I imagined that each of those numbers –for example, in a monthly, weekly or daily candlestick chart– could represent or correspond to a note in the tonal musical scale.
I had before my eyes, thus, a chart that could also be read and interpreted like a musical score. I immediately wondered what that score would be like. This melody that we in the ever growing Bitcoin community compose every day, how would it sound?
I decided, then, to embark on the challenging task of translating that BTC/USD chart to discover that hidden melody, from the initial exchange rate in 2010 to the 31st December, 2017. Naturally I came across many obstacles. Confronted with the strictly mathematical aspect, because of the great fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin –especially during 2017–, I was forced to modify several tonal intervals, as there is no instrument that can comprehend a scale from 1 to 20000.
What you will listen to, then, is a close approach to this “score”, focused rather on its artistic aspect than on the mathematical one. As I worked on the musical translation, images kept coming to my head, so I decided to also make a video to go with the melody I was uncovering.
I leave you here then this game, this experiment truly hoping that you enjoy it. A way to acknowledge my work, if you liked it, is to share the video among your friends.
And I also leave here my address (1F6ovYqfXFR1HJPCv1ovFFeFHuc5aojys9) and QR code for those who liked it so much that they would like to collaborate with a donation ;)
A warm hug to all the global BTC community! Gerswissman.
