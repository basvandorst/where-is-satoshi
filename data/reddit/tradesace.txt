So you think he is willing to throw away his success, freedom, and family for a quick get rich scheme only to end up in jail a few months later?
 Errrr, no.
Once again are you trying to crusade for freedom of speech or whether GAW is a scam or not? You seem to be conflicted.
So if you aren't transparent you're automatically scamming?
^ fail logic.

So you're saying the third party which is supposed to be one of the most respected publications in the world would also be willing to lie to its readers?
You need to get back to reality.
You clearly live in a world where everyone is guilty until proven innocent.

This should answer most of your questions

If what they are saying proves to be true. What does it matter? Are you here to crusade for freedom of speech or find out if GAW is a scam or not?

Since I doubt you even read it...
"We brought in a 3rd party who could do an independent review and report their findings directly and publicly.
This continues to protect the privacy of our financial information.
Today, one of the most respected publications in the world reviewed our mining credibility.
They reviewed our wallets, (we signed them,) and our transactions.
They reviewed our partners.
They even reviewed detailed information about our mining center to validate our mining.
The independent review will be released sometime next week "
Emphasis on this part -
"Today, one of the most respected publications in the world reviewed our mining credibility."
This review will be out next week. 
If you choose to doubt even after that, there is no convincing you ever.

No, I do not live there.
Yes, I am both a user and customer of GAW + hashtalk but that doesn't mean I'm not able to reason.
The level of fraud Josh would be committing (if he really was lying) is immense and with the amount of public statements he has made, there is no getting away if he is scamming.
GAW is one of several investments I have made.
Bitcoin is bitcoin, please do not mistake paycoin for bitcoin.
+ revealing their wallet addresses exposes them to security risks. 
If I handled massive amounts of BTC I would not want people to know where all my wallets were. This is simple reasoning.
