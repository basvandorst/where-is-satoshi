Wait a while, it will be all good. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:24:25
I was expecting to read about how bitcoin is better than ethereum and litecoin, not credit cards! 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:09:38
Maybe is something with your browser.
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:29:19
Did you try with MultiBit HD wallet ?
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:19:33
Interesting service, could try it 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:51:58
I don't get it. He stole them from who? 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:51:16
VPN is fair secure option, don't be afraid just make your transaction. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:00:21
Bitcoin forever and ever. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:30:33
Classic! Always entertain me. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:12:58
It's a most secure way of keeping your coins. Use MultiBit HD
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:49:37
Too low fee cause the problem and also blocks are full. Next time increase it.
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:39:33
Why they do this ?
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:47:11
 take a look on this.
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:29:35
You're looking in it. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:33:33
I'm afraid  that you coins are lost forever, in future keep them locally somehow.  
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:28:55
Use peer-to-peer trading marketplaces like Brawker and Purse
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:16:27
I don't buy it, probably other things are the reason. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:31:04
What you mean by Global Market Reset?
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:58:27
I like this video, worth watching it. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:37:58
I admire this guy!
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:49:31
Well Written… Gives a deep insight
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:36:44
Localbitcoins.com is your best option. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:51:00
 Nice offer, worth trying it. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:30:58
Electrum is great option or MultiBit HD Wallet
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:04:22
Gambling, gambling all the way. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:33:29
You can buy up to $100 on ChangeTip.com
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:26:37
This is so painful story, too much money wasted.
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:03:42
Probably it is caused by you low fee, wait a day or two. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:59:39
With creditcard it's not possible
try something with 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:10:48
Really great news, can't wait. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:04:06
It's a new wallet read more about it in here 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:50:09
Anything is possible, but...
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:22:13
They won't figured out how to use it anyway. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:47:00
So where will be this recognized ?
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:01:39
Interesting offer but 5BTC is too much for me.
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:48:35
Great info, I really appreciate it, saved my time.
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:43:38
What is the purpose of bitcoins mixers ? Thanks
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:57:01
More fee in your transactions next time. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:15:36
So these are the reasons why more and more people are using it. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 19:16:24
When it will be available in other currencies then USD and CAD?
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:56:25
For bots, seems like funcaptcha at the moment is the best and i like it too if you don't have to solve it a lot of times(some faucets require to solve it 4 times and that's a bit boring but still better than other impossible captcha with strange text)
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:28:12
There are plenty of them, Circle is you best option, also coinbase or airbitz
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:26:48
I think so, but why bitcoin investment in casinos?
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:33:56
Coinbase is also a good choice. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:54:00
Looks amazing. I want it too. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:45:08
It's a small amount, but good enough to start with bitcoin's world. Try with 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:05:53
It's back on right now. Nothing special happened for sure.
