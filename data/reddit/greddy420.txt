@_date: 2019-07-31 01:01:15
it amazes me how many people jump into the space with no idea how it works...just find a good wallet on your phone and send yourself $10 to see how it works, check how the fees work and be amazed you just sent money to yourself without a middle man.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:26:35
well thats why you play with $10. You will learn which wallets rape you on fees, the time it takes for the bitcoin to show up. It's all a learning experiencing.
Once you see how it works in real time you start to see why its valuable, at least thats what happen with me. Then you can explore hardware wallets to secure your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:03:02
some do, if it wasn't used it wouldn't be worth anything.
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:01:16
once their all mined the transaction fees then go to the miners verifying the network.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:24:28
thats held up by the bank because you need to wait for it to clear, not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:05
how are you losing money if you came in at 9400? its almost double that...everything you need to know is on the side bar my friend.

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:42:39
buy a hardware wallet, move you coins from CB to there, leave them on the hardware wallet and sign up on Gemini and start buying there. Dont keep your coins on the exchange unless you can deal with them being stolen if the exchange gets hacked. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:08:01
old people are scared of new technology and having to learn it. Its not bad, just a learning curve that most older people are scared to go through. If you ever helped older people with computers you can see how frustrated they get.

Not sure of the date but this was the [article]( that turned me on to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:46:24
really nails the point though, they are at 5k on the show and now they are double. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:55:54
its actually 2140ish.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:55
yea, good luck timing it in this market, bitcoin doesn't give a fuck. I wonder how many people got wreaked trying to short it when it hit 10k thinking there would be pull back. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:39:28
Guess we will see, I personally think its still under valued at current prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:08:52

Hodling since 2012-2013...no stress at all, didn't get into this to get rich although I knew it was a possibility. Got in to stop funding the shit system currently in place. Plan is to hold till 2020 and reevaluate the space and make my next move. Until then buy the dip and aquire more coins!

@_date: 2017-12-06 01:34:26
I never said it was easier, definitely the harder of the two too figure out, but considering its backed by the Winklevoss twins its pretty trust worthy, its normally cheaper then coinbase as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:46:40

I just switch from Coinbase to Gemini due to the fees, so far so good.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:05:54
no at the moment every 10mins 12.5 BTC are mined, in 2020 it will "half" and 6.25 BTC will be mined every 10mins. Every 4 years the amount mined will be cut in half, which is why the last one wont be mined till around 2140. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:41:53
Only bank, they actually don't support my bank so I opened a checkings account with one they did. Extra step but so far it was worth it. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:54:54
 - the exchange charts are on the right. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:21:30
I just switched from coinbase to Gemini.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:51:44
I use a KeepKey offline wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:21:55
I hope not i need to buy more before it gets that high, not at 21 yet. haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:25:55
if you can I would suggest holding it until 2020 when it halfs again. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:08:59


No they dont, they reqire you to KYC to use their trading platform.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:44:00
2020 it halfs, the last coin will be mined around 2140. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:38:30
watched it yesterday I liked it. Doesn't bring you up too full speed though since its older, end of the movie is like mid 2016. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:08:37
I have a Keepkey, its pretty awesome. It supports BTC, ETH, LTC, and DOGE.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:22:18
just made my first purchase with them this morning, went smoothly. Have not had to use the support yet, verification time took 2 days. Lower fees then Coinbase which I was using. 
Only complaint is I haven't found a way to set up a re occurring transaction like you can on Coinbase. Was a nice feature for cost averaging your BTC. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:09:34
Yea you cause use the wallet and not KYC.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:51:37
its the Coinbase app, and no those 3 coins are all they sell atm. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:51:42
I was actually looking for something similar to this the other day. You da real MVP. ��
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:44:38
I don't, I ended up opening a checking account with capital one just so I could use it for Gemini. Actually just made my first purchase with it today when the price dipped below $800
 As far as wallets go I would get a hardware wallet like keepkey, ledgar nano, trezor. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:31:37

@_date: 2017-08-04 17:40:34
From reading their blog I was under the impression you could download the beta firmware to access the shit coins before they release it to the public no? Mine are also on a keepkey but I'm just hodling both coins for now.

Not long enough but every year ive at least doubled my investment, I didn't get into Bitcoin to get rich. I understood early on it was going to take time. Right now its just a waiting game, and I continue to stack sats everyday while waiting.

Indeed, it works as well.

download the wallet, I think all you need to do is copy the wallet.dat file into the directory and replace the old one and once the chain downloads it will be there? 
Don't quote me on that, I've never done it, use google.

because leaving them there is stupid. Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

Yes its taxable

This is the first time in bitcoins existence that there as been unrest in traditional assets if im not mistaken. It was created because of the crash in 2008.

bought the same amount today that I buy everyday...no fucks given.

same cept im buying on the way up too.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:38:02
I buy $10 a day no matter what the price is.
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:17:04
I use to buy lunch everyday at work, decided to pack and put that $10 into bitcoin everyday no matter the price. If you smoke do the same, use it as a reason to quit and take that money you were throwing away and buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:39:48
That's not what it means, it's from a post on the original Bitcoin forums of a drunk guy spelling hold wrong when it was crashing.
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:29:40
every 4 years the amount of bitcoin that are mined every 10mins are cut it half. The next one is in May 2020.

Nah it shouldn't.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:32:19
$10 a day, gave up buying lunch at work and put that money into bitcoin now. will toss a little extra sometimes when it dips. If your brand new I would say cash app or Gemini, Coinbase can go fuck its self.
As far as a hardware wallet, I would personally wait until you have a few $100 worth of bitcoin and then get the hardware wallet. While your accumulating I would read about how the hardware wallet works. Definitely don't keep it on an exchange in less your comfortable losing it or your attempting to day trade (personally think this is bad idea, 
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:59:14
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:41:31
more like once a day, imo. Pack your lunch, take your lunch money and buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:02:30
Gotta start somewhere, just realize your still early to the game. I been trying to get my buddy into them since the $200-300 price. Still has yet to buy in because he doesn't understand it and to lazy to do a little research. Instead hes reading all about "flat earth", shit drives me crazy. haha
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:37:48
You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin, you can but a faction of one. There aren't enough bitcoin for every current million to own one, its kinda a big deal.
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:01:37
doubtful, i don't think he gives a shit if you like it or not.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:52:00
i remember that feeling, feels good, try to control the emotions on the dump. If your in this long term the pressure to sell gets heavy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:53:33
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:35:10
Also holding till 2020, not taking the chance of losing them day trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:36:02
people act like the confirmation time wont get addressed down the road. Even if it doesn't get addressed a different crypto will rise for daily purchases and atomic swaps will let you convert your bitcoin to use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:19:16
Id get a Trezor, you can make separate wallets inside the hardware wallet if you wanted to make some for family. Then just leave directions in a will on how to access it if something happens to you. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:27:28
Shit at 15 id say dump whatever you got into it until the next halving in 2020. If you lose it you'll only be 18. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:58:41

@_date: 2017-11-30 22:01:31
Keep in mind only 1800 bitcoin are mined each day. In 2020 that number is cut in half, 4 years after that its cut in half again and so on. 
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:24:29
 you need to go to their site to get the full interview. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:07:59
there are a lot of factors involved to determine that. Before buying I would watch some videos to learn what you are investing in. Here's a start, there's a ton of info on his youtube page. The side bar gives you all the info you need to get started with buying.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:45:10
Im buying the whole way down. Hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:41:08
Welcome to your new beginning...soon you'll look like a crack fiend reading bitcoin related news and checking the price. 
On a side note I did this same thing except it was with the money I would waste going out to lunch every day at work. Took that money and put it in bitcoin. Up over 400% since January and down 20lbs, no regrets. I now tell anyone that ask about getting into bitcoin to take a habit they waste money on and spend it on bitcoin, easy not to worry about losing it when your wasting it on non sense otherwise.

You cant withdraw it from Robinhood so your pretty much renting bitcoin. They do plan to let you withdraw, but it wont be possible at launch. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:02:32

No, it will not constantly rise to that...it will be up and down like it has been. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:19:07
Got my first one at $11, bought more last week. Don't spend a ton on it but still accumulating when its going down. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:46:04
Because when the price goes down it's not a big deal since it's just "lunch money" and I'm not dropping 1000's during a single purchase. 
Takes a lot of the stress out of it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:33:27
how was this legal? It looked like helmet to helmet to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:51:57

[muh roads!](
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:29:03
I buy every day no matter the price. Not really a fuck up unless you dropped a nice chunk of change at one time. If that's the case may I suggest looking into dollar cost averaging, most the people using that strategy in Bitcoin have come out on top. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:26:33
yea I never had it go bad for me but heard of stories, then they locked Charlie Sherm up and shut it down. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:46:51
Was buying $10 a day at $4800 and will continue to do so. Not a fan of seeing it drop in price but not worried about the either.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:14:33
Haha yeah I bought it the whole way down as well. ��
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:33:39
Right...I've used it on steam and used a shift card to buy some stuff online. Definitely folks using it everyday to buy stuff. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:52:42
the transaction fees then go to the miners once the 21M are mined. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:03:53
Things don't go up forever. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:42:25
I take the risk and keep a few hundred bills on the exchange at all times for those dips.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:04:08
this...people can't grasp the concept of buying fractions of a bitcoin. This year alone I've bought $10 a day while dropping some extra cash during the dips. Since Jan 11th that investment is up 400% and has made me more then my day job salary this year. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:11:52
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:05:06

@_date: 2017-10-29 15:55:20
yea they should pop up once this is finished unless you moved them. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:57:25
How else would you know when to buy the dip? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:49:43
Bitinstant, man were those some sketchy times you basically sent them money and hoped Bitcoin showed up in the wallet address you provided. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:14:33
Haha yeah I bought it the whole way down as well. ��
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:45:42
I just keep about $400 on the exchange at all times, buy $10 a day and have that extra cash to take advantage of the dips.
This strategy has treated me well over the the last 2 years.

How long have you been into Bitcoin? Most people blow the risk out of proportion because they were here when everyone lost their bitcoin on Mt Gox. 
Coinbase still hasn't given its user's BCH, and I expect them to make you wait for 2X coins as well. 
I keep my on a hardware wallet where I know they are safe and keep my seed stored on a cryptosteel. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:27:39
i'm not impressed with his queue card reading performance. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:48:51
because the exchange can be compromised, it has happened in the past with Mt Gox.

you can buy fractions of bitcoin, dont need to buy 1 all at once. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:29:50
fewer then when it happens to the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:59:25
can I ask why you think its a pyramid? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:05:28
Dollar cost averaging, spend more on the dips. Enjoy the ride. As for when, I was buying in the past, bought more today, and will continue to buy more after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:59:42
Coinbase is an exchange they don't mine as far as I'm aware. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:33:39
Right...I've used it on steam and used a shift card to buy some stuff online. Definitely folks using it everyday to buy stuff.

Yea and Paypal was trying to be bitcoin but the banks regulated the fuck out of it until it just became a payment processor. Yes I know the banks exist, and I dont trust them with my money after 2008 which is why I got into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:48:00
I use the money that I  would spend at work on lunch and buy $10 a day. when it dips I spend more depending on what type of money im willing to gamble. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:48:30
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the share price. The investor purchases more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:09:30
the value comes from the network and technology behind verifying that the transactions are legit. I see your view but I think your missing the technology bitcoin is running on, ether way as someone thats been in it since 2012 I hope your wrong! haha
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:47:49
Also in it long term. Exiting isn't even a thought till the next halfing in 2020.

@_date: 2019-09-20 22:10:32
I have some, not in an IRA though, just in a normal trading account. Hoping to use that money and not have to touch my actual BTC when and if its worth enough to stop working.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:46:59
we will be dead before that happens but the miners are then verifying the network and working for the transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:00:11
if your losing money at 6.7k your not a hodler. a hodler is still up 100's of % at current prices.

Dunno if this answers your question. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:08:29
read the sticky post at the top of the sub reddit.

theres a place for that.  [@_date: 2017-05-27 20:31:03
I buy on Gemini mostly, but also use Coinbase, and Karken. I store my coins on a hardware wallet like Keepkey and Trezor. I don't trust the exchange to hold them long term. Coinbase I would say is the most user friendly for new people in the space but the customer service is terrible due to the volume of new accounts. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:30:57
agreed, if you dont ever sell you still win in the end, it goes higher everytime it "crashes", you only risk losing your coins trying to play the "market" during each dip. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:08:28

hey whatever works, its all good for the ecosystem as far as im concerned. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:20:35
i use Gemini daily but don't wire money just ACH transfers. The bad support is due to the influx of new users id assume. Also use Coinbase, been waiting 3  weeks or so now for an answer on a friend who is locked out of their account. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:15:10
just ride it out, try to time the bottom and buy more.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:38:52
Why would people tell you this? You become a target at that point. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:58:14
You don't own them if you don't hold the keys. I use both services but I don't store large amounts there. Look into a hardware wallet. I have a KeepKey and a Trezor, I like the KeepKey better for the interface and the different coins it holds. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:10:01
Gemini is another option. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:23:45
No, they act like two different wallets at that point and aren't linked together. You would have a bitcoin balance on both the hardware wallet and your Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:39:00
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:01
heres to hoping it gets to $1800!
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:32:30
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:25:15
if I hadn't been in the space since like 2012 I would be freaking too. However watching it do this a handful of times now its expected, hoping we see sub $2000 again! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:32:36
best advise I've ever followed. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:06:49
I like the KeepKey hardware wallet, also own a Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:18:29
hope hes still hodling!
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:58:07
You must be new here, buckle up and hodl on tight.

I'm sure he knows what he was getting into. If you search his name on this sub reddit there's a video of him 4 months ago buying 25k in Bitcoin on twitch to play poker with. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:24:36
If you do go all in which I don't recommend, dollar cost average it over time. Dont but 32k at once, buy like $50 a day and splurge on the dips you can take advantage of. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:40:50
its been this in the past, expect it to continue.

yes. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:00:59
I dont see why you would trust them. Try getting a hold of them right now. Good luck getting an answer. I have a friend that can't access his account at the moment, been 2 weeks since we submitted the ticket and still havn't heard from them. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:03:20
I don't understand what your asking. If your asking if you can buy more from the exchange after sending what you already own to the hardware wallet then yes. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:29:10
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:19:17
as a long term hodler it doesnt bother me a bit. Buying more on the way down. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:47:52
this, its part of a healthy market.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:20:27
umm pretty sure anyone who bought at a peak previous to the latest is still up at least %100 on their investment. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:33:47
buy a little ever week. spend a little more when it dips, its called dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:29:14
Yea looks like Gemini is currently down for maintenance. Try Karken? All of them are pretty bad right now, huge influx of new users. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:10:58
Most people are in bitcoin to get away from wall street other than the new folks. fuck wall street and whatever it does. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:47:28
Mine as well since about $1500. keep hodling!
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:12:06
bitcoin isn't part of that market, a move like that id imagine would just make bitcoin go up. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:44:24
I only use Coinbase for the reoccurring buys. I use Gemini for everything else, I got tired of Coinbase outages due to the influx of new user and terrible amount of time it takes to hear back from someone when there are issues. Signed up to Gemini and Kraken so I got different options. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:37:30

it isn't ready to replace fiat yet, it is however a good store of value currently if you been in the game before the pump.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:58:21
I don't think it will go under $1 just for the novelty factor. Under $100 is not out the realm of possibility but I find it unlikely. 
Either way I hope your putting your money where your mouth is a shorting it all the way down. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:14:57
 thats one way. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:44:05
Thats bad ass, didn't know he was into Bitcoin.

a lot easier then trying to day trade it.

Dollar Cost Averaging, it takes a lot of the stress out of watching the price daily. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:44:33
sucks to suck. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:53:49
instead of spending the $500 in one shot but $10 a day/week/month and more when the price dips. Dollar cost averaging, its worked well for a lot of people here.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:13:26
You can also sign up at Gemini, unlike coin base when you deposit money they let you spend it instantly but they won't let you withdraw it until the initial deposit clears. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:47:08
Buy small amounts daily/weekly/monthly and take advantage of the dips. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:18:13
well we will all be dead by the time the last one is mined so no need to worry about this.
