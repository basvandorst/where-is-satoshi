My faith is in the new technology and smarter people than me physically knowing how to implement this technology to speed up so many things.  
It's also about decentralizing computing power.  
Ultimately, I think when push comes to shove, people are going to be salty as hell for not buying tokens and coins that represent an actual business need - especially when people actually realize the applications. Take Modum for example, or Gulden. Everyone loves to shit on altcoins here, but these are real world business applications.  
Sure, a lot of big companies will just use IBM etc to build them custom blockchain (much like big companies getting the same IBM etc to build them intranet in the 90s) but eventually companies just specialising in blockchain for a specific business purpose (like supply chain operations) will shoot ahead of the clunky, poorly implemented, shitty versions of this new tech that the same old companies continually churn out.  
Blockchain companies focusing on specific problems, and building rapid solutions to it will be the winners in the end. Bitcoin is just the reserve currency for a whole ecosystem that will be the next step of the internet.

You could replace Amazon and Blockchain with IBM and Internet and that statement could be from 1992.  
We haven't seen the real applications of Blockchain yet.
