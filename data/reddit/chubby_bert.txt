Got in Contact with the Support-Team, and for my Country there are special Rules if you use a SEPA Transfer: It is locked for 72 hours after they get the money. They also said this is just for the first 1000€ of depositing, then they will trust the account. Apparently there has been some fraud with the SEPA System in the past. One small Nitpick: They could have said this beforehand. If you need to move it fast, you are screwed - well, I can wait for another couple days, no biggie for me. 
*Maybe the Coins are even worth some more Dollars then ;-), the charts look promising.*
The Bank Transfer itself was really fast, I think i will use Kraken in the future again, really convenient.

Sounds like a lame duck right from the start. Yet another Browser, exactly what we need :D

Or what people used to say about Beta Max, the Viewtron Service, the ERP Program, Copland by Apple (lol), Gateway, HD DVD, Vonage (the first VoIP Service), Microsofts Zune, Palm, Segway, ......

Have a DK2 and recently got a Vive. This is awesome, finally I can ditch that awful creditcard for paying for my VR porn. VR Porn truly is awesome. POV and Head-Tracking, this is the only time I really felt presence. VR Games are a niche... VR Porn is the future my lads!

I only have experience with my DK2 and my Vive, never have had a CV1 on my head. But I like my Vive, especially the controllers. And no Facebook, big thing for me.

It is *excellent*, and worth the money. Most VR Porns are filmed from the POV of the male actor, who mostly sits/lies on the bed, so no dizziness from sudden movements. And you can look around freely (180-220°, depending on the camera they used) in the movie. This makes it so realistic and gives you the feeling or real presence. 
If you can try it sometime, definitely do so.
