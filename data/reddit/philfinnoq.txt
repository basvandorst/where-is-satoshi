Coinbase, Coinfinity,...
There are a lot of good youtubers for crypto to start with the basics. Take a look on the youtube channel of "ameer rosic" or "ivan van tech". On Ivans channel you´ll get a better understanding of the technical part.

Neither sell off nor a lot of FOMO. I think the community already know what is possible in both ways - up and down. 
For the next big run I believe the price has to go up to 15k.
