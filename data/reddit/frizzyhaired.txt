For reference that's where I stopped reading and started laughing. It'd be hard to imagine a less efficient system than bitcoin being invented today. I believe gold/silver were used as a currencies, are vastly more efficient than bitcoin and didn't require central states.
Edit: also I don't care about using centralized system. I have no problem using moneygram/western union to send money or whatever.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:30:09
well i'm glad your personal feeling trumps actual research.
that said there are legitimate arguments against CPI (doesn't include fees outside of base costs like "checked bag" fees which have been growing more common). they won't make the difference between 2% and like 5% though.
but really while some items are growing in costs a ton some things have decreased in costs a ton (see oil/gas or computers). nobody notices things that go down in price. people say housing is exploding in price but you should look at housing in detroit or pittsburgh. it all averages out.

Doesn't matter if it's "important" the goal is to see how much a dollar can get you. If it's something people buy then it goes in.
The basket of goods is determined by having randomly selected families keep diaries of everything they purchased over some period of time.
You'll find that the BLS itself says that


which sounds like your complaint?


I don't know why you think CPI should reflect this. Nominal wage growth is low and inflation is low. That makes sense. Poor people can get screwed in an economy with low or high inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:30:38
It's not. The US dollar is backed by the force and will of the US government/military. That gives it value.
Bitcoin isn't. They say bitcoin is "scarce" and that makes it valuable but the abundance of nearly identical alt-coins makes it clear that nothing is actually scarce about it.

no some currencies have hard tethers to value outside of mere perception. The USD gains value because I am forced by law to pay my taxes in it. This means that it has use value to me at least once a  year.
Edit: to clarify as long as the USG exists the dollar will always have non-zero value to me since I have to pay taxes every year
Edit2: And I'm ignoring other stores of value like gold which have manufacturing uses which act as a lower bound on their value.

The way I see the metaphor is that NoSQL promised a tons of great things. Turns out it couldn't deliver most of them. A few of the things it offered turned out to be anti-features. We later realized that what the right approach was to iterate on what already worked (e.g. adding features to posgres). Basically all the hype died and it continues to live on in a few niche use cases where it got heavily rebranded. 
That's where I see crypto-headed which is, apparently, heresy here because in that future the people here don't end up living on the moon.

The background is probably the least likely place I'll use it. Interactions between a small number of large institutions that run the economy can be negotiated more efficiently "off-chain" or as I like to call it "entirely without bitcoin"

I mean unless you have actual methodological complaints against the CPI then I think that really is the only thing left to do. But my point wasn't that that good alone makes the difference to CPI. My point is that people who complain about inflation forget about all the things decreasing in price.


Yes, because housing is increasing in price faster than CPI nationwide (probably) but it's not increasing outlandishly fast in most places. For CPI to be an average there needs to be some goods inflating faster and some inflating slower. 
Your argument seems to amount to "everyone is saying housing is super expensive" therefore CPI should be much higher. I'm saying that's overblown. Here I picked another random city nobody thinks about from the top of my head:  prices are down.


who cares about the barrel price decrease? what does that have to do with CPI?


I mean, according to CPI's calculations...yes it all averages out. You know they report multiple forms of CPI including only certain kinds of goods right? See  
Do you think the people computing CPI are incompetent? Or is there a conspiracy?

those are averages too! we would need those broken out by sub-population to have any idea (poor people live in areas where prices are growing more slowly and just forgo certain kinds of healthcare)

@_date: 2018-01-07 01:01:21
you don't seem well informed here. i suggest you look things up or just stop responding.


CPI doesn't measure product quality. Indeed that's one reason to believe that CPI overestimates inflation since today's $200 laptop crushes a $200 laptop from a decade ago. Go look at CPU prices recently. AMD entering the market crushed intel's prices. The increasing power of low priced ARM processors has meant that people can get by with cheap chromebooks. Prices of all kinds of ICs have tanked.


Nope. This is a rabbit hole of "what is a big city" but straight up 20% of the population lives in rural areas. 70% of people live in area with a population above 50k (a very low bar). Pick a random city nobody talks about, say, Des Moines (population 200k). Look at its median home price over time.  It's increasing above CPI but it's not exploding (4% v. double that in silicon valley).
Edit: Here's what gas prices have done 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:18:09
is it actually possible to have inflation in a fully bitcoin economy? you will always have more goods/assets/etc as the economy grows being chased by less bitcoin (as it is lost). Seems pretty unlikely.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:47:39

@_date: 2019-11-09 20:23:38
plenty of real-world currencies are pegged. are they not "real currencies"? I mean one of the main advantages of bitcoin is avoiding regulation and you also attribute that benefit to tether. Fractional reserve is a legitimate use case for a currency. It's not really a gift card or casino chip because you can spend them anywhere. Though I do appreciate the comparison with cryptocurrency investing to gambling.

@_date: 2019-11-10 00:31:46
I see no reason order depth is a better measure of liquidity. Order depth can be faked even easier than volume. Also order depth will be less for something like tether because people don't trade it for profit because its value is pegged. Instead they will just take the current bid/ask. There's no point to setup tons of stagnant buy order at $0.95 for a tether because it never gets there.

@_date: 2019-11-09 22:07:07
coinmarketcap lists the volume of tether and bitcoin. liquidity is proportional to volume. meanwhile not all bitcoins are fungible because of block lists some impose.
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:48:31


No? Market buys never hit the book and so don't appear in the size of the order book. A market could have billions of trades an hour but an arbitrarily small order book. Your measure would call such an asset "illiquid" even  though there might be no slippage if you sold mililions of shares.

It really doesn't. I say this as someone with actual experience inside a bank. You say "Banks exist for controlling flows of money" but what does that even mean?
Most bank lines of business continue to exist in a bitcoin world. Hell probably even credit cards. Let's see: people will still need mortgages/student loans, companies will still want lines of credit, banks will still employ financial advisors to manage other people's money, provide corporate anti-fraud services, etc etc. There will probably be new services like: helping to secure large cold wallets in their vaults, insurance around crypto-deposits (which is why people will keep their deposits in banks and not in their trezors at home) and connecting your account to lightning networks (look all of the above is based on the fantasy that bitcoin is a thing in this future but this is now doubly a fantasy).

wait I said late 2008 and then you used the annual number... I'm assuming you misread? And yes I'm not claiming there is 2% deflation or anything. Just dips into deflationary territory.


Don't patronize me.


One property. That I don't want. And its a property that currencies like monero implement way better.

that prediction has nothing to do with bitcoin... and has nothing to do with reality

BTC has a fixed supply. Any future releases should be priced in in an efficient market. Consider that the USD is nearly deflationary sometimes and tons of that is "printed".
Yes, I explained how they can operate within the law. A fully legally compliant blockchain would have major extra adoption from the mainstream economy and so any extra hurdles would likely be paid back in value to the coins.

CPI was near zero/ negative in late 2008 and 2009. I guess that's "many years" but I remember it vividly. 
Oh, see that's the one feature I grant that bitcoin legitimately has claim to. Crime. I have no interest in helping people commit crimes so yeah I don't care about that.
Edit: the word dis-inflationary before supply helps your argument not at all. Especially since in the long run it's just "fixed"
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:20:03
just...no.

[citation needed] Also you ignored the other things I listed which didn't exist int he 1600s.

??? deflationary? also why not.
AML/KYC only matter if they keep customer deposits. They could totally make a bitcoin clone. Or they could just take deposits of people who could prove the origin of their coins.
