Exactly.  Very well said.

Keep in mind its a class action lawsuit.  This means the plaintiffs don't have to be present in court.  They are represented by an attorney.  Therefore, the time put into this is literally just the time it took to create the lawsuit.  Its not an overwhelming time commitment for the plaintiffs.  The idea was for it to be an overwhelming time commitment for the defendant(s).

Is that really accurate though?  I feel the opposite is true as Bitcoin Cash supporters are mainly just spending time knocking Core.  Whereas most Core supporters just dismiss BCash for the most part and focus their energy / time into furthering Bitcoins agenda.  I think there are always going to be a small subset of Core supporters who will constantly berate BCash supporters simply because of the tactics used to market the Bitcoin Cash movement.

This is actually going to change very soon.  Dana has announced that they are working towards making the fighters wear generic, UFC 'uniforms' instead of the shorts littered w/ advertisements.
Good thought though.
EDIT: Haha, not sure why this is getting downvoted,.....its only true.  Reddit is nuts.

Hey man,dont worry there is hope!
The same exact thing happened to me but on Bittrex. They sent me an email asking very specific questions regarding my account, then had me send them a selfie (no joke) holding my passport/license as well as todays date handwritten on a blank piece of paper. 
After I sent them the custom selfie along with the detailed information regarding my account, Bittrex support almost instantly shut off my 2FA which allowed me into my account. 
Now I know Coinbase is a completely separate entity but im sure your result will be the same....perhaps it will just take longer because Coinbase is Coinbase. 
Keep your head up. I had alot of funds on Bittrex when this happened and I almost had a heart attack when I couldnt get in. It will all work out, dont worry!

Didn’t BCH fork on 8/1?  BTC price didn’t do much around that fork I thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:27:49
Well....lets just hope they know what they are doing I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:00:20
Completely agree. Well said. 
If setting up a node can be outlined in easy-to-follow steps and doesn’t cost too much, we should ALL BE SETTING UP NODES!

Its basically digital gold at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:14:53
My confusion is centered around the question: where should I keep my BTC during the fork?
Obviously the ONLY ‘benefit’ to this fork for us hodlers, is the dividend we all get by cashing in our requisite B2X tokens and potentially buying more BTC. If we want to maximize profit, we probably want to sell B2X immediately.....right?
Well......if I am keeping all of my BTC on my Ledger Nano S, then I may seemingly be at a disadvantage to move my B2X in an expeditious manner due to this replay issue, correct??  Why wouldnt it be more advantageous for me to just keep my BTC on Coinbase (I know, I know Coinbase is the devil) since they have publicly agreed to make both coins available to us immediately and available to trade ‘shortly’ after the fork. 
Please someone clarify what im missing as to why moving my coins to an exchange is not the most beneficial to maximizing profit during this ridiculous event. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:25:58
The reviews/ratings are pretty bad already.  I cant imagine this thing will get much exposure. 
You are correct in that the misleading UI will surely cause newbies to lose funds at some point.  They should be ashamed of themselves to purposefully cause such confusion.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:21:10
This recent stunt by BCH has me semi-nervous as a BTC-hodler.
Can we add a meaningful synopsis on the many reasons as to why I should NOT be worried to just hodl BTC and not to convert over to BCH?  I understand that BCH's sudden rise was likely due to an arbitrage attempt, but I would like any/all proof in that BTC is still the place to be and BCH is not worth my time.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:54:00
Yes I was and yes I still do not have my BCH. 
I am just basing all information on Coinbase’s public statements. 
In all fairness, their public statement regarding the BCH fork was public as well so we all knew what was going to happen. Im curious why you are pessimistic in this regard as history does not support your line of thinking. 
I am just trying to figure out the most profitable move for myself as an investor. Whats wrong with that?  If you can provide assistance I would appreciate that but a snarky reply with little substance does not help anyone in the community :(
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:33:32

Roger Ver went to federal prison??  Is this a serious comment?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:28:35
Havent developers basically said that onchain blocksize increases will most likely happen at some point?  I think the whole issue w/ Segwit2X (from the beginning) was that it was being forced w/o consensus and it wasnt the right time to implement such a change.
But I thought that most Core developers agree that a blocksize increase will most likely be necessary at some point.  At least that has always what I thought haha, I could most definitely be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:04:53
Just the newly forked coins. 
My plan was to sell the B2X coins immediately to:
1: show my support for Core and BTC
2: capitalize on the initial high B2X price since I imagine it will tank soon after the fork
It just seems counterintuitive to move my coins from my secure Ledger to an exchange since an exchange is the LAST place you should have your coins during a HF.....but the alternative solutions seem to cause issues when maximizing profit on the forked coins becomes the motive. I guess this whole situation has me a bit confused as to what the most +EV move is here. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:47:42
Is the consensus amongst the community to dump the B2X right away?  I feel like that could be a strong cohesive effort if enough people planned to do that, showing strong community support from for Legacy chain by doing so. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:27:14
Wow, Im surprised you actually referenced the Pepsi / Coke sip test.
Im sure you know by now that the 'sip test' was a failed experiment, as it simply showed that Pepsi's characteristically 'sweeter' flavor, allowed test subjects to say they preferred Pepsi over Coke when taking 1 sip of each product.  It was later concluded that the same subjects preferred Coke over Pepsi when drinking the entire can.

Please show some class. Civil discussions are always warranted. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:49:50
You seem to be extremely knowledgeable in this realm. I am just having a difficult time figuring out how I would easily execute either of these options. Pardon my ignorance as I have never run a node before but as I mentioned in a previous post, I am very open to doing so in a manner that would provide support for the Legacy chain
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:31:16
I cant say that I would advise either option. Just hold BTC and your future is set!
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:59:04
Remember that community doesnt represent 100% of the people involved. There will always be toxic people involved. 
The majority of devs just want this project to survive in the most pragmatic way possible. Forget about the past, its the future that we care about!
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:12:31
What is your plan for the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:10:51


What is this comment based on?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:51:13
Im confused why you think you couldnt be a BTC supporter since you want bigger blocks. Do you honestly think the BTC community is just against bigger blocks for no reason?  Thats just silly. 
The BTC community simply wants all changes to be implemented properly and not rushed. Bigger blocks are almost an eventual inevitability, it must just be approached in a proper way. 
The communities need to unite and not stay so fragmented and toxic. Lets all get rich and continuing to propel the success of BTC, its in everyones best interest!
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:25:11
Haha wow thats concerning. Alot of people are going to blindly lose money this way. 
Doesnt Roger realize that this type of deception(honestly, maybe even this very example) could be a driving force for the actual collapse of BCash. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:40:11
Definitely the most well written post on this sub, all year. Your sentiment is portrayed very well in this post my friend and I am very happy for you. Everyone deserves that feeling of contentment with life. You are 100% correct that Bitcoin has the potential to be our freedom: financially and societally. 
Thank you for your words. They are inspiring to me.

Wow this is crazy and to be honest, I am very surprised at Bittrex for not providing you support to help you out in this terribly stressful time. 
I was locked out of my Bittrex account about a month ago when I upgraded to a new iPhone and forgot to manually re-enter all of my 2FA codes from my Google Auth app. Luckily I contacted Bittrex and they had me provide very detailed information about myself and my account while also sending them a selfie with my passport/license clearly shown. After sending the selfie, they almost immediately turned off my 2FA so I could login. 
Not sure if your issue is similar at all but they were extremely helpful in getting my issue resolved. This is why im perplexed as to why they arent helping you. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:02
I agree.  Id use LiteCoin way before BCash.  Bitcoin Cash is just a failed alt-coin that they are using to facilitate pump/dumps.  Bitcoin Cash supporters are basically breaching some type of ethical boundry by even supporting that project, imo.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:39:00
Are there currently steps in place to remedy this concern?

Yeh I'm pretty much trying to get a better understanding as to why so many 'seem' to be completely dismissing BCH as the viable successor. I really don't know how it can be possible to be so certain?

What are you basing this statement on?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:29:47
Didn’t realize people were timing the market like that with BTC. I just assumed hold for a few years and never sell but I understand the merit behind that. Aren’t the fees crazy when converting to USD?  What is the best place to do so?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:26:33
Yeh i agree and it’s definitely a mutually exclusive relationship, they simply cannot both exist for an extended period of time. 
What are ur thoughts on BGold?  I was thinking I would dump mine much more immediately than BS2x as it is a much less contentious fork. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:16:42
I have the exact same question. Can anybody shed some light?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:15:50
You sold 100% of your holdings already??  Was that an accident or on purpose?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:51:20
Well....I think we are all HOPING that is the case but your claim is essentially baseless. If it were true, nobody would be worried. Instead, this is a very serious/contentious event that could go either way. Being objective is usually the best strategy when approaching any ‘fork’ in the road as opposed to being subjective and assuming everyone thinks as u do. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:09:46
OMG, your age is a prime number!  This is a definite sign that you should invest.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:32:27
Same with me man. I am hoping my Ledger Nano S knows what to do with the splits as I’m assuming that’s the best way to store the BTC in the interim. But much like you, I’m dealing with money that I want to eventually use to pay off my mortgage and such, so I’m pretty careful about each maneuver.....except of course the 10 BTC I use within Bittrex to mess around with alts haha that stuff is just madness. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:38:09
Yes this is clearly what happened. OP should EDIT post as to not trash Bittrex team for no reason
