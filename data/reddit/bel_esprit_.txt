These types of polls are based on phone calls. Since 3 million more people voted for her, I can see how the pollsters came to this conclusion as they were collecting their data.

I’m kind of annoyed that Bitcoin was featured on FOX, for some reason

Exactly! They will vilify it. 
They will try to control it and legislate it and take it out of our hands or shut it down.  Just like everything else.  And the Fox News/Trump demographic will go right along with it bc, hey, “I could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Ave and they’d still support me!” 
The very *core idea* of democracy is inherit in crytpo, and just like all things democratic, is in danger if it gets on the wider republican radar.

If it makes you feel any better, I lost a lot of money too, but in ETH. I stored it on myethwallet and then I lost the private keys in the most dumb way possible. I don’t even want to write it out here bc it’s that embarrassing and makes me cringe thinking about it  (it wasn’t a scam, it was just me being an idiot). 
I was so depressed and upset about it that I refused to even look at the exchanges or crypto subreddits for months, and changed the subject when people would bring up crypto to me in person. 
I believe you’ll make it all back, though, and so will I. People have lost more and have made back even more. We are not alone in that.

I specifically remember a full cart being $100 in 1998. My mom was on the poor side with 3 kids- and I remember being able to eyeball how full the cart was getting and knowing once it was full of groceries, we were at $100 and my mom would be upset bc she couldn’t afford it. She’d reluctantly hand her credit card over and tell us kids that we needed “to save” the groceries and not eat everything on the first day bc this was it for the month. 
A full cart now is like $300.

Probably because I grew up in Florida and then moved to California as an adult, so prices are higher (plus I probably buy more expensive stuff- since I have no kids- than the whatever canned items and cheaper stuff my mom was getting). I can go back and mention this in my comment. 
Regardless, I remember a full cart = $100 in Florida when I was 12yo in 1998.
