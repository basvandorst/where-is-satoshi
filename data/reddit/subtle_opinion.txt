unnecessary taxes, loan rates, the credit system, how much money you have to spend to live. quality of life has gone to shit because of the banking system. maybe to some not to this degree. but they have enslaved us with the new form of slavery called debt. everyone is working for money instead of the money working for them.

@_date: 2018-03-30 18:21:59
pulled a loan out at 10k to buy 1 coin. bought my 1 coin. paying off said loan from Jan. best decision i ever made. whats even funnier. this doesnt bother me. Just more coin to buy when money becomes available. I have seen bitcoins growth. it has never crashed. its always going up. this is just all the get rich quick people finally pullign out for the sake of the money they spent that they shouldnt have spent.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:28:45
shit sorry let me put it into context so you dont blow a blood vessel there, jimmy. With the way the US currency controls the world right now it and how they are blocking certain crypto, it will be funny when bitcoin is the main financial system and the us fiat is sub par and being blocked by crypto. geez. slow your roll king of the exchanges.

Buy your cryptos and precious metals. when this shit fails.....its gonna fail so fucking hard. and guess what. youre gonna blame the wrong people. look at your government, the federal reserve, and the IRS. also all centralized banks dealing with the rothschilds should be burned. they are to blame for all of this.

any site that requires me to turn off adblock is not worth my time. even if hitting the esc key method works.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:52:03
once bitcoin gets to the point where .00002 of a coin will buy me a car and a house, then I will stop HODLing.....
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:33:40
they will be trying to trade millions for a bitcoin. thats how it should be. not the other way around.
