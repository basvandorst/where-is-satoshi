Bitcoin will reach a ceiling. I am not sure if it was reached before this crash, or if it will be reached in a year - but the currency is a bubble by its very nature. It is not backed by some service or good, it is not connected to some firm - it has no intrinsic value.

That's the thing though - it does not have any value in itself. It has nothing backing it. Currency is backed by economies that have to accept said currency, stocks are backed by the company they are from, giving you a degree of ownership and all the perks that come with it.  
Bitcoin and other crypto doesn't have any of that. It's basically a bunch of people agreeing "Yeah, we will use these conceptual coins to do business" - with no guarantee that they will continue to do so tomorrow, no value backing it, nothing. The only thing backing Bitcoin is the faith of holders that it will still be worth anything tomorrow.

Yes. It is a very clearly unique coin - but that does not give it any intrinsic value, does it?

So you have very special unique batches of numbers. There is still no intrinsic value, nothing backing it.

Literally nothing. Not kidding. Bitcoin sells because people think Bitcoin should sell. It's not backed by an economy, like actual currencies, and not backed by value in a commodity or company like... well, commodities and stocks. It's as if people decided "Hey wrapping paper is really cool, I will buy this scrap for $20.000" - only that you cannot even wrap anything with it.

How do bitcoin and other cryptos offer "real" utility? No-one has to take them, no-one sets prices. Sure, you may say "The dollar is only used because people agree on using it", but say that changed - say that the US government suddenly abolished the dollar. The consequences would be so far-reaching that not being able to pay with the money in your pocket might not even be the biggest thing - we are talking an entire collapse of international relations here.  
Same for stocks - the company will try its best to keep on existing, if nothing fishy is going on. They will try to maximize profit, and thus the worth of your own shares.
What happens if people don't accept Bitcoin anymore? The world turns on, and a couple thousand investors are out on their asses because the bubble popped. There is nothing backing it - it is only worth the money it's traded for - what is it now, 11k? - because new people buy in and other people think its price will rise again, not because of any service or good backing it. It's like a currency without an attached economy, or a stock of... the stock itself. Shiny lights on your monitor that are for some reason assigned such enormous values.

And what is that proof of work worth? Someone calculated the coin out, sure, but what can you do with it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:51:20
What technical utility do they offer, and how is this utility tied directly to a certain coin itself, and not the concept of crypto currency in general?

lol  
So much propaganda, so much misinformation.
