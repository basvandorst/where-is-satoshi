@_date: 2018-01-01 13:44:47
I guess since they didnt technically cash out...should be good since it was transferred while it was still "property"? *shrug*
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:29:43
Just wait it out...when it settles a flock of new buys will make it shoot up...been there, literally about to press that sell button and then massive gains..glad i held. Now i dont even care when it dips, bitcoin is here to stay...this is just a test and an opportunity

Lightning conducts transactions on private channels outside of the main network, then settles them to the primary blockchain in batches. That makes transactions much faster and much cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:51:08

Good time to advertise!
"Gov't shutdown? Secure your future with Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:19:14
...Makes sense, but CME and CBOE will manipulate futures by pumping and dumping into Bitcoin...it will be a win-win for them...they probably caused these dips knowing that the first set futures contracts will expire soon...it will be interesting
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:57:00
Welcome back...i'll wait for you at the top

Just a bunch of stupid ass speculations 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:39:59

@_date: 2018-07-16 19:38:46
I think that when you start talking liquidity you are turning it into an asset...which it can be...but the point is to HODL and use Bitcoin...(for everything that we can)....like the currency it was meant to be.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:15:52
I'm good either way...downside I just buy more while you sell, upside I just keep HODL'ing :)
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:58:07

Without a 1099...nobody reported your gains the IRS so..eff them. My tax person said there's no process for that shit without a 1099, you are just calling unneeded attention to yourself if you reported the gains...they are going for whales they dont care about the little fish..at least for now
