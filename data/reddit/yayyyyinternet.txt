I don't think switching is a good solution. will be the first place new bitcoiners come to, and if it's horribly corrupt and supplies terrible information, then that will have a significantly negative impact on the community. There is value in continuing to stick around and protesting in the hope we can eventually fix this problem.

You don't have to transfer your bitcoin directly from circle or coinbase when making purchases. If you just transfer it from coinbase/circle out to your own wallet (or a wallet managed by a company not in the US) and then make the purchase, then the purchaser has total freedom. Unfortunately, since coinbase and circle are exchanges and act as "money transmitters", they are subject to this kind of government bullshit.

Yes, but they also give 15% back to the user to use as micropayments for websites.

He's willing to spend a significant amount of energy making a tool that might be a step in the right direction toward a free and open internet. Even if he falls short of that goal, him trying is still a good thing. And on top of that, he's using a blockchain, which is bringing more attention to the technology. He's a sketchy guy and he might not be taking the optimal approach, but who cares?... Let him do his thing, and maybe he'll produce something significant.

I don't think this is really a benefit. There doesn't seem to be any advantage (cost, convenience, service, perks) to using this card over existing cards as a consumer.

Who cares? Brave could have a massively positive impact on the bitcoin economy and the internet. Don't dismiss the product and its potential just because you think one guy is a dick.

I agree with your point, but is it a concern at all that the "community" becomes controlled by a larger body? For example, say in 20 years,  75% of the mining and hosting of nodes is done by companies. What is to stop them from banding together and coming to a consensus on upgrading to a code update with questionable consequences? Even if the 25% of individual users do not support this change and refuse to adopt it, won't it become the new standard anyway? I understand that users can choose to keep using the old code, but doing so might require them to leave the entire developed bitcoin economy, sort of like creating an altcoin. Once the bitcoin economy is large, the act of breaking off might be impractical.

That makes sense. So basically my interpretation of all this is that given the nature of corporations and governments, someone will probably eventually figure out a way to mess with the network in some unfair way. But it will probably be more like slow, gradual corruption over several decades instead of large, system-breaking changes. That's still a very reasonable outcome in my opinion.

Every single comment I read on this post seems fake. That's sad.

As I said in my reply to jstolfi, I agree with your explanation of the open source aspect, but I'm more curious about the probability of a capture of the "community" by businesses and governments. Currently, the majority of nodes and mining is done by individuals and well-intentioned groups, but what if that shifts to being dominated by larger bodies? Won't they then have the power to decide the dominant code to be used?
