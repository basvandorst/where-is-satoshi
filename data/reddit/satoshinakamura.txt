My investment is in Bitcoin, not an altcoin that may be better than Bitcoin. As much as I talk about the "future of money" I'm really just a Bitcoin bagholder, and don't want to see crypto advance beyond the babysteps of Bitcoin because of my monetary investment in the old and obsolete way of doing things.  
Any talk of advancement, or improvement upon the current system is heresy, because it's not satoshi approved Bitcoin.  Nevermind no one knows who satoshi is/was, or what he/she wants, it's not bitcoin.  And no doubt that anonymous person/persons have my best interest at heart.  I'm a true belieber dammit!
So even though I regurgitate anti-statist and old fashioned insults at perceived buttcoiners and altcoiners, I'm really just as embedded in an old way of doing things.  Hell, that's where my fiat is tied up.  But please don't call me out on it because my fiat will suffer!  ;-)

Forget about the world economy, it's about what Bitcoin can sustain.
Overstock.com currently gets less than .1% of it's sales from Bitcoin, and you're comparing it to the world economy?  Definitely putting the cart before the horse.
Forget about the world economy, it's about what Bitcoin can sustain.  And right now, Bitcoin is having trouble keeping up with all the coins miners are dumping, hence the drop in price.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:52:25
I don't get the part about how you save money by putting it into an asset that loses value compared to the dollar.  One that has lost significant value to the dollar for over a year now.  
Seems like that's losing money and not getting anything for it, except perhaps the life experience it takes to write such an entertaining post about imaginary money saving.  
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:16:48




You must be trolling, this post is just too naive to be real.  First, you don't know all the different motivations are for all the different people involved that affect Bitcoin or the government.  Even if you did, to reduce it to lose/win, bad/good, right/wrong is to be wrong.  
Most people have conflicted emotions about mundane things, like what movie to watch or what to eat for dinner.  When there's money involved, the stakes go up and people will do things they know to be wrong, or against their long-term interest.  So how are you gonna unequivocally say the "stakeholders" interest is in line with the holders of Bitcoin all the time?  And that the opposite is true with the government?  
Like I said, this must be a troll.  No one is that naive.

Why should taxpayers be on the hook for your electricity, depreciation, and losses due to bitcoin fluctuations?  That's on you, not me and everyone else.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:49:42
This thread has a good idea, but 10% is too cheap for my coins.  Given the obvious anti-fragile nature of Bitcoin, and the fact that IT IS THE CURRENCY OF THE FUTURE, not to mention the honey-badger, I think 10% is too cheap.  How about 50% discount?  Or hell, just give me stuff for a satoshi donation!  When the price goes to the moon these businesses will have gotten a bargain even at 50% reduction.  Come to think of it, I've decided to HODL, so sorry statist scum, you'll not get my Butts for ANY discount!!!

People are just upset they have their money tied up in a losing investment.  Any bad news is potentially a cause for people to sell, and for the price to drop further.  The echo chamber is understandable, even if it does keep new adopters away.  
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:00:46
It's more than speculation, it's a reasonable assumtion.  It makes more sense than any other explanation.  But it's not proof so you can assume whatever you like.

Just wishing for something doesn't make it so.  So far everyone who has predicted the dollar will die has been wrong.  The only thing that's died are people who think the dollar will die.  There's a great chance you will die before the dollar dies.

I just don't remember the dawn of the internet the way it gets portrayed in Bitcoin, and I especially don't see the comparison between the two.  And actually, regulations were essential to the growth of the internet.  
Regulations were very important early on for the internet, and helped make it what it is now.  Laws had to be updated to include digital content and and consumer protection, and successful implementation meant everything else could be left alone.  In other words, without updated regulations on consumer protection over the internet, Amazon and ebay wouldn't exist.  And NAMBLA and other despicable criminal organizations' presence on the web would be dramatically outsized, to the extent one can wonder if mainstream adoption would've ever taken place if regulations hadn't been updated to include the WWW.
Another reason the comparison between internet ca. 1992 and Bitcoin ca. 2014 isn't apt: in one sentence I could explain to someone why the internet would be useful/important/revolutionary, whatever: and no matter who they were, they had an impossible time arguing.  You like knowledge?  The internet has more free knowledge than you library (yes, even in 1992)  You like convenience and saving money?  E-mail provided instant and obvious benefits to anyone who ever sent or received mail.  You like card games?  Now you can play Bridge with people around the world whether you have a deck or not.  You like to look at cat pictures?  On the internet... you get the point.  The internet was truly a revolutionary game-changer for the way the world operates. 
Now ask yourself: can the same be said of Bitcoin?  I'm not sure how to even explain BItcoin in one sentence, let alone what it's benefits are, and why it's better than fiat.  Elements of bitcoin are appealing to Libertarians, but remove the political element, and aside from transferring wealth to and from places Western Union doesn't, it has limited use.  Except as a speculative tool to get rich quick.  
What I'm saying is, even on reddit there are people who remember the dawn of the internet, and know why comparing internet adoption and Bitcoin adoption is pointless and wrong.

Your action of receiving protection from the United States Army, using roads, receiving and/or hiring someone with a public education is a start.


Here in America, that would be the United States Judicial System, which is taxpayer supported.  Seeing as how you don't want the Judicial System to exist, I'm not sure how neutral they will stay.  


Yes, the contract is different than most contracts, as are the benefits from said contract.  I've never had a better offer on roads, water, protection from foreign countries and entities that would do me harm, provided education, etc. all in exchange for a pittance of funding.  In terms of cost/benefit, there is no better value than citizenship.  If you disagree, you should renounce citizenship and get off the grid.  If not, then STFU because hypocrisy is never admirable, even when complaining about the big bad government.


Are all questions dumb?

Exactly.  The people who said it was a fad wanted it to be a fad.  Their opinion was a vocal minority at most, responsible for a lot of propaganda that survives today on the very internet they said was a fad.  Now it's used by Bitcoiners to attempt to pump up the price for reasons this agnostic can't understand.

Wow, so you like build your own roads, drill your own well for water, and maintain your own army?  That's pretty impressive.  I want to move to your country and not pay taxes while you provide all those services I "don't need" and won't pay for, but still use.  
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:17:45
I don't get it.  Is the point that because the Internet was once called the "wild west" by the NYT, and bitcoin is often called the "wild west", that Bitcoin will take off the way the internet did?  
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:21:21
I have to say, you didn't manage to circumvent anything.  And you clearly support welfare, asking us taxpayers to foot the bill for the depreciation on your equipment, losses due to bitcoin fluctuations, and even electricity.  
Just sign up for food stamps instead of filing a fraudulent tax return.  They both are ways to cheat others out of their money, but at least one is legal.

Why would anyone tell you Idiot?  You would simply take credit for the information, assuming you actually follow through and write something.  What's more likely to happen is this:
"Dear Idiots,
I’m not going to bury the lead; I am not publishing the article tomorrow that I said I was going to on Friday.
In fact, I never intended to (not yet anyway), and I certainly never intended to loop in the main-stream media so that they could pile on to our fledgling community. I simply hoped that a deadline would pressure Jon and Peter to resign quickly (and appropriately)."
Keep working on that credibility issue, idiot.

It's clear OP is a gambling addict.  As such, I find it impossible to believe that even if the price gets back to 650 that OP will actually do the right thing and sell.  It's clear that it's "to the moon!" or bust, and it's looking a lot like bust.

How about replace the title of the article with "Arguments for why Bitcoin is better for vendors and worse for Consumers", because that's all this article is.  Same old rehashed arguments we've been hearing for years, still failing to resonate with virtually anyone outside the echo chamber.  And as long as it's a buyer's market, it will stay that way.
