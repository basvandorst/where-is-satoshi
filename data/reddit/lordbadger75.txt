It does not mean nothing. 
The model with bitcoin is it's gold. Volatile yes, but not going to zero.
Hyperinflation means going to zero. Protection against this is huge.

It's too early, it will become a currency when merchants feel like they are FORCED to accept it, because they'd rather hold bitcoin than fiat at least for some of their wealth as a hedge.
Bitpay was too early. 
Circle is fine actually, they are using bitcoin as payment rails for moving fiat around. WSJ article was just clickbait.

Hyperinflation is terrible for the poor, because the few paltry savings of the poor is mostly in cash, other vehicles are not available to them.
Bitcoin provides an alternate vehicle, and prevents the scourge of hyper inflation from being inflicted on a population, including the poor.
Bitcoin is not about saving the poor, it is just a value neutral technology that has some costs and some benefits.
It's good to try to stay rational about what bitcoin is, and not try to shoehorn it into an ideology or some feel good propaganda.
Bitcoin is good, like bread is good or electricity is good. It is very simple really. Don't overthink, just think clear.

Whale logic.
He's trying to suppress bitcoin price while he liquidates failing altcoin position and buys back into bitcoin.

the wsj article, especially the title, seems biased against bitcoin. The circle press release clearly states they are still using bitcoin on the back end.
"another major step forward today with the introduction of Spark, a set of protocol additions that provides a way for digital wallets to exchange value using blockchains, including Bitcoin, as settlement layers.
The first implementation of Spark comes via two new markets and currencies: We’re excited to announce partnerships with Korea’s Korbit and the Philippines’ Coins.ph. "

For what it's worth I did not mean that bitcoin CANNOT go to zero. I mean that it is designed to act like gold, and eventually replace it. It may, it may not. But that is the design objective.
I appreciate that you are frustrated and assure you that at no time was I trying to troll you. peace.

get 3 ledger hw.1 wallets. They are $10 each. Cheap enough to treat as office supplies.

You can exchange US for BTC (sell btc). You just can't exchange it back (buy btc).
You can't buy dollars on circle either.
They just treat bitcoin like every other currency..... except that you can't send dollars into btc, whereas you can send btc into dollars. They just don't want to deal with the AML/KYC stuff.
