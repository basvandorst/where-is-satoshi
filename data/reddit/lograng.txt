You have either swallowed whole, or are a source of, delusional propaganda. Almost any object can be used as a weapon, with zero money, zero prior discussion among others and no digital data transmission. For instance people could drop stolen copies of a heavy book about AML on other people's heads from a great height, killing them. They could use gloves made from suspicious transaction report forms to avoid leaving fingerprints. And we can go on. But despite all this, the risk of dying from terrorism, outside of an armed conflict like in Syria, is basically Nil, less likely than being struck by lightning, and much less likely than suicide due to the burden of KYC/AML.
AML/KYC, surveillance and oppression cannot and does not ever make us safe. It only places an unnecessary burden and intrusion on peaceful people, breeds anger and resentment, and enriches a small group of snake oil salesmen and corrupt demagogues who are in on the scam.
So much wretched effort and money is spent on enforcing that stupidity. All of it is absolutely wasted, was never what we wanted and should have never been done. That is the truth; do not ignore it.
Tax is no excuse for intrusion either. And governments are at no risk of losing their massive unearned supply of money that flows to them via VAT and so on regardless of their malicious actions.

Exactly. There's nothing awesome about requiring ID and a photo of your face to buy Bitcoin. Nobody should tolerate such shenanigans. Despite what some authoritarian morons might say, "KYC" is not a good thing.
