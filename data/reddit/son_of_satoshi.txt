Yep, I had the same experience... sad but true.  
So we still don't have a messenger with  good wallet.  
Also is quite suspicious why Citibank is promoting this. And for a bitcoin styartup that is not something you can be proud. For me banks and bitcoin is not a trusted mix...

Yes good tool but I already moved those coins with electrum, importing the private key from that counterparty wallet.  
And like Great_stefan said getgems lost their good start.

Sorry but my father just went out for a while to buy some cigarettes... when he's working is smoking a lot.

Gates is a crook. Remember his "famous" formula of depopulation ? Don't you think that he already included YOU in that formula but he misses him?

Oh yeah! I think getgems just received a punch in the face with this... Cool

Yeah I think my father fucked up some TXs or he just sent you regards from Mars :)

In 10 years the USD and any other fiat will be mentioned only in history books.  
Stop thinking in fiat conversion. You should be thinking that you have trillions of satoshis...

yep, definitely somebody "reported" the page like containing harmful code and now is in a blacklist. This practice will be more and more used by evil corporations and govs.

Sorry guys but my father is already landing on Mars so is quite busy right now. He told me that, there on Mars, he will start a new blockchain soon.  
Good luck!
