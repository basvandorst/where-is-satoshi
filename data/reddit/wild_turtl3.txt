Transactions frozen on coinbase?

What’s another good exchange I could use on mobile? I can’t access on desktop during the day. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:38:55
This is great news. I already use and love robinhood. However from a more technical standpoint, how will this work? 
Will robinhood also serve as a bitcoin wallet? If not I’ll be interested to see how they build how the app for blockchain transfers.
Will it be similar to coinbase? Purchase on exchange and then use secure address to send to wallet?
Many open questions.

Could someone point me to a good article/video about what he is discussing here? I'd like to read up. thanks!

I'll look into this. Never heard of it before. Trusted service? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:01:31
Meant to ask if there are fees for this?
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:02:56
Is there a fee? And how long does it take to receive btc if I just use a bank transfer?
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:57:23
That's all I need ha
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:22:56
I've never even heard of it. I'll definitely take a look
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:41:43
This seems to be the consensus. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:19:03
Oh I didn’t know that. Thanks for clarifying 
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:34:36
Ok I was looking at this one. Glad to know it’s a good one. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:34:53
Ok thank you!
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:25:53
This is a pretty misleading statement. Maybe if you’re moving that kind of money peer to peer on a really inconvenient system you’d have those kinds of fees. 
Most banks would wire any amount for a flat fee. We wire sums this large all the time for real estate transactions at work. The fee is $50. 
I support btc but I just don’t like big sweeping statements that could be misleading. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:18:41
Thanks for the response. Will definitely look into these!
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:12:05
Thanks for the suggestion
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:46:06
If I wanted to learn more about running a full node. And/or about doing it on RPi3. Where should I start? It’s not an area I have a ton of knowledge in but Id like to look into it. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:34:52
Thanks. I'll start digging around here. At lot of this is over my head at the moment..

Regardless or not if this guy faked his death. It brings up a real question/concern I always have with bitcoin. We all like to talk about how the finite amount of bitcoin is a good thing (and I definitely think it is). 
But aren't there certain situations where it can be a bad thing? Because the amount can never surpass 21 million, won't the amount always technically be declining (once the final block has been mined)? Whether it's people passing away, misplacing passwords, etc etc. 
Think of all the people who mined blocks early on and talk about how they were never able to retrieve their coins because they didn't responsible store their bitcoin and keep their keys (lost computers, etc). These situations will always happen, however infrequently. 
So what is to stop the amount of bitcoin from continuously diminishing? (Again, once the final block has been mined) Is it just that the total 21 million is so large and so divisible into smaller units that it won't matter? Or are there other factors I'm not considering?

Could someone help me understand these depth charts? Does red represent the price people are trying to sell at? And green the price people are trying to buy at?
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:39:39
And look at how big some of those red volume lines are

Banning these ads are a good thing. Many of the phising and other bogus scams you hear about come from these ads. Paid to be at the top of search result. 
Early adopters fall prey to this and forever write off bitcoin as illegitimate. 
Banning things like this will help in the long run.

I bought bitcoin in 2017 but haven't sold any. Is this similar to capital g/l? Do I not owe or file until I sell later?

Another vote for dgax. Didn't know it was owned by coinbase. Will both purchases end up in the same "wallet" then?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:27:30
I'll look into it. No fees would be great. Can I pay though PayPal here or does it need to be direct to a bank account. Do I need to have any additional worries about security? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:34:28
Ok gotcha. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:34:28
Ok gotcha. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:41:20
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:46:50
Yeah I did find these and there good. But I can't really stream a YouTube video at work. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:06:13
thank you for the info. I'm trying to get into things slowly and safely. lots to catch up on. appreciate the help.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:04:52
I've just got into bitcoin recently and I'm overwhelmed. I've been using gdax or coinbase. What does all this mean for me?

Would bread wallet be an acceptable wallet? Or do I have to get something physical?
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:34:11
Thanks for the response. When is the cutoff for this? I have a very very small amount of bitcoin. Is a hardware wallet necessary? I've also been looking at software wallets like Bread Wallet. Thanks again.

Is 1.5% transaction fee pretty standard from these apps?
