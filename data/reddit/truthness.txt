If a currency with a dog face on its logo was adopted by drug buyers and sellers, and speculators had jumped in to buy it because it was going up, that coin would have the liquidity. That's based on being first, not the coin itself.
Tipping Dogecoin creates a pretty good network effect, because that's how we get energized to support promotions and charities. Earlier had 5 of the top 10 posts on An hour ago there were 4,300 people in If not for so many Dogecoins produced everyday, the price would be going up.

Since you can't actually see buyer interest and activity on places like Overstock.com or any places that accept bitcoin, I'll keep the comparisons within Reddit. You can actually see interest and real-time activity on Reddit.
For an apples to apples comparison, here are two sites that sell basically the same things:
Take a look at the subscribers and how many people are currently on [this site](
And take a look at the subscribers and how many people are currently on [this site that is less than 2 1/2 months old](
That's just a small look at how one is used more as a currency while the other one is saved like gold.
BTW, [this is what the CEO of Reddit has to say about dogecoin.](  Don't forget to [click this.](
Thems the facts. Where the currency users are, the currency acceptors will follow.

You misunderstood what I said. When I said you can't see the interest on places like overstock.com what I meant was you couldn't go to the site and see how many people are actively on that site at that given moment, and if you could you couldn't tell which ones are paying with cash and which ones were looking to spend bitcoin. Reddit, on the other hand shows how many people are interested enough in a subreddit to subscribe to that subreddit and it also shows how many people are currently on that subreddit at any given time. I then gave you links to 2 marketplaces that sell basically the same things so you could draw comparisons between how many people are interested in each of those marketplaces and how many people are currently using those marketplaces when you visit the links.
I agree, paying with bitcoin and dogecoin is way better than cash or credit. It's much easier, less expensive, and I can't wait until I can buy anything without having a bank or the IRS digging their nose in my business.

Rap and country music both have fan bases and if either one disappeared their fans wouldn't flock to the other. Different things appeal to different people and the presence of one doesn't mean it's taking away from the other. Variety allows people to associate themselves with something on their own terms, not what someone else thinks is best for them.

I've heard you can do things like apply commodities to a colored coin, but how do you prove those commodities exist? If there was a way to prove they exist, how does a colored coin commodity buyer know you didn't sell off the commodity 2 seconds after you proved they did exist?

How about this: The bitcoin community uses 10% of their holdings to buy mtgox, with the 10% going to the people who lost their coins and fiat, and after the purchase, run the exchange as an open source non-profit entity.
Having an exchange that no one has access to isn't a very good way of having a decentralized currency. You take control of your money from central banks and hand it over to a weasel that highlights the only copy of the cold wallet private key and then lets his cat lay on his keyboard.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:57:00
Of course he lost the private key. Remember what the idiot said at the end of his casual chat. "Well, technically speaking it’s not “lost” just yet, just temporarily unavailable." That means he had the private key on his laptop and his cat relived himself on it. That's what a leak on the cold wallet meant.

@_date: 2014-02-26 13:40:22
His question didn't actually have anything to do with the comment he was responding to. How many people accept it two months into its existence has 0 to do with how many people want to use it (right now). BTC is 5 years old and there are less people who use it than Dogecoin. Isn't it the users of the coin that give it its value or does it's value come from it's logo or whether it was first? MtGox was also first. So was Betamax, Broadcast.com, myspace...
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:57:24
Not that I would ever consider doing it either, but you have to remember that it was the dumb people that didn't have access to their private key that day traded the price up to $1,200 per coin. Without them trading and raising the price up, there would have been no publicity that generated all of the dumb money that came in and jacked the price even higher. Now all of those silly day traders can't keep jacking the price up for us. Lets just hope another big round of dumb money floods in.

February 27th 2014 Update
Dear MtGox Customers,
   For once in my life I will tell the truth: I had the cold wallet private key on my laptop and my cat, Bitcoin, knocked one of my coffees onto it and fried the whole thing, including the private key. It's all Bitcoin's fault.
Mark Karpeles
EDIT: What I really mean to say is my cat Bitcoin drank my coffee and took a leak on my laptop which contained the cold wallet private key.
EDIT 2: OK! OK! I took a leak my laptop and fried the cold wallet private key!
EDIT 3: Dude, I just ate the wallet, man. I don't know what I was doing, I was just hungry and needed to wash dishes and my knee hurt and all of these banks were distracting me and I just ate it.

Here's one place I found in about 1.2 seconds: [stuffcoins.com]( Look how many bitcoin listings they have.
Is McDonalds not worth $95 billion? Do they not bring in $28 billion in annual revenue? Do they not have a clown representing them? Do you realize that $95 billion is almost one quarter of the value the Winklevoss twins think all bitcoins will be worth? That's 1 company that sells to the people you're turning your nose up to that's worth almost a quarter of what the Winkelvoss twins think all bitcoins will be worth, and it doesn't matter what they sell. They could sell bags of stale air and $95 billion is still $95 billion.

The original comment by MostAwesomest said that bitcoin is saved like gold and Dogecoin is used as a currency. All I did was back that statement up with facts. Your opinions are completely irrelevant.
I wonder if McDonalds corporation would be a $95 billion company if it wasn't built around an insane clown that appeals to idiots and youth that spend over $28 billion a year on their garbage. I don't know, but I do know that the insane clown hasn't slowed them down. No other restaurant comes anywhere close to their revenue or market value because idiots and youth are very profitable.
