This is correct, but it is made extremely difficult to become recipient of Direct Debit payments - much more difficult than to start accepting credit/debit card payments. The easiest way is to use some third-party provider like Sage payments etc, but even then - it takes couple of weeks before DD payment clears into your account. There are also strict limits for new accounts and extra security checks.  
      
So yes - it is easy to setup fraudulent DD payment for someone else, but very difficult to actually defraud someone of their money.

That is what worried me too... Actually, when I thought about it more it just convinces me that Segwit2x takeover is not going to happen. 
  
Only complete idiot would support going ahead with extremely complex IT project (which is Blockchain technology) without enough skilled engineers working on it and believing in it. If you think about it, this is just recipe for disaster. If takeover WILL happen, then I think this whole thing was a failure and someone will have to try again from scratch anyway.

This is also my conclusion. If Bitcoin will not survive this, then it didn't deserve to survive. I believe reason will prevail, because this project is run by fucking engineers. Fucking engineers created the world we live in today.

I don't think this is a valid argument. It is like saying that just because someone survived 20 car crashes, it somehow makes him immortal.

Obviously he doesn't seem to know much about it all. But he is not wasting his electricity.

He is probably mining using Nicehash, which uses his GPU's to mine ETH, but pays directly with BTC

I just sold for $700 too. For the second, and last time. First time I sold what I got free from the exchange @ around $900. This time I sold what I kept in my own wallet.  
  
I guess there was a lot of people like me who decided that $700 price tag is a good motivation to figure out how to extract BCH from your own wallet.

 I agree with you on that this is FUD... but your newspeak makes me think that I am agreeing with an idiot. This triggers my self-defence mechanism which asks me "Am I on the right side of this debacle?".  Can you not make your, quite valid, points using just normal language?

I just hope that all the BTC I gained from that epic pump are not from some poor bastard who bought in all that Cash propaganda and got screwed. I wish my new BTC are Ver's coins!

Second that. They need to upgrade their servers. My sell BCH sell order at $2200 did not execute because server overloaded (when BCH quickly run above $2500) and I had to sell manually at $1920.

RT made some documentaries showing NatWest parent bank, RBS in bad light.  
  
I personally would refuse to do business with anyone who posted bad review about my business.

My strategy is to provide best service as possible, but I realize that some customers are just waste of time, and I also do not believe that customers is always right. I am trying to focus on happy customers who appreciate my work - this brings me more business from referals. Of course, if I wronged someone - I will make it right, but if someone is just an asshole or I simply don't like them - I will refuse to do business with them because it is waste of my time and energy. I prefer peace of mind than few extra bucks.

This answer confirms that if you really understand some problem you are able to explain it in plain language.

So first they create problem and then they charge for fixing it? Sounds like a scam to me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:22:22
They could have just said "sorry no money here" and refuse transaction. Banks, however, never refuse - hence creating unexpected debt. Then, as you said - they charge again for fixing problem which should not exist in the first place. They have technical means to do it, but they choose to just cash in on this procedure. With so many automated payments today, it is very easy to run into this trap even if you are keeping your books very well.
