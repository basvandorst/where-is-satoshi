Investigating - Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex.
We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up.
The theft is being reported to—and we are co-operating with—law enforcement.
As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach. Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC. We are taking this necessary accounting step to normalize account balances with the objective of resuming operations. We will look at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation. While we are halting all operations at this time, we can confirm that the breach was limited to bitcoin wallets; the other digital tokens traded on Bitfinex are unaffected.
We will post updates as and when appropriate on our status page (Bitfinex.statuspage.io) and on the maintenance page. We are deeply concerned about this issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it. We ask for the community’s patience as we unravel the causes and consequences of this breach.

""We still haven’t made anything official, we haven’t announced anything publicly, but we have an internal team working on this. We’ve done some proof of concepts."
"For us, the first obvious space to explore all of this in is payments, particularly international payments. Later on we think smart contracts have the potential to transform many of the other things we do."
He adds that while Santander is very keen to explore the possibilities of blockchain, we won't be sending cash over blockchain networks any time soon. Belinkey says that "while getting to a working prototype could be something that we do within months, getting to an actual product that regulators say is good to go and the compliance guys like — that will take a while."

Probably best news of the month.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:49:27
As can be conclusively seen, the relative impact of the Bitcoin network does not even register on the radar of the fiat and gold-based monetary systems, representing a very conservative relative environmental impact of just over 0.13%, and a relative economic impact of just under 0.04%. When one considers Koomey’s Law, we can expect energy/GH to continue to half every 18 months until 2048. This means that we can expect our current industry best efficiency of 0.733 W/GH to each 0.0000000873804 W/GH – so even the most ignorant, arrogant, narrow-minded and pseudointellectual critics and arm-chair academics should note that in the event that Bitcoin scales to a million times its current size and market cap over the next 30 years, it’s environmental impact will still be insignificant compared to existing systems. When considering Moore’s Law, we can expect $/GH to continue to half every 18 months until at least 2020. When we consider the advent of centralised emission-free renewable energy, we can expect tCO2/GH, and possibly even $/kWh, to tend towards zero. The more agile and dynamic bitcoin companies can take advantage of these trends, but the sluggish, inert and over-encumbered incumbents simply cannot. As time goes on, Bitcoin only becomes more sustainable, while legacy systems continue to bloat year-on-year.

I think is a good opportunity. I would also consider divest a very little part in other promising decentralized projects, for example I have invested little in Factom, and stronger in Maidsafe. Maidsafe looks pretty interesting from an user point of view, and also an investor point of view.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:12:28
I2P is a similar approach to SAFE in some many things, but also different in anothers, in my opinion SAFE is stronger if we speak about security and privacy. One of the most important things and benefits of SAFE is that SAFE has a token for the network, this token is useful for two things: 
1- Create network effect (because you can "mine" this token providing a Vault (hard drive spsace) to the network. Network effect is important for the network, look at Bitcoin, without network effect you have a small and slowly network (like i2p).
2-Totally anonymous transactions (because SAFEcoin is going to work without a blockchain, instead will be using a transaction manager, in Safecoin not every node verify a transaction, only small groups chosen randomly, and finally the transactions is only recorded in the sender and the receiver, nobody more can know that this transaction happened).
Also in SAFE is pretty easy to develop and application that use the SAFE network. For example you can make a software similar to Spotify, Popcorntime, using the safe network instead of the actual Internet. 
They had been working in this for more than 8 years, so I think is a real solid project and it will work. 
The GUI looks nice and easy to use:

Agree. Maidsafe and also DARPA are trying to create a truly, efficient and massively scalable decentralized Internet emulating natural patterns.

I agree that Bitcoin could be perfectly the global currency of the "Internet 2.0" but not the Internet 2.0 itself. 
I don't know if they Internet will continue with today infrastructure where central severs are who own the Internet, that's pretty dangerous, or which other model will takeover. Maidsafe is really interesting proposal, but could they get a network effect to disrupt the Internet? Maybe, but it's not so easy. If Maidsafe proves to be safe, probably we will see all dark markets and Tor services moving there and using Safecoin, the token of the network and truly anonymous because it doesn't exist a public ledger... then maybe Bitcoin could leave the dark past and Safecoin will take that role, and after that? Will Safe Network continue growing beyond illegal activities to host the whole Internet? I have no idea.
And about DARPA I don't know in which state of development they are. They have been speaking about the "new internet" for the past years, so they could have something soon.

Good read. But the blockchain is not so perfect, with the blockchain is not easy to achieve massive scaling due basically to block limits and the fact that you need a copy of everything in all the nodes. That's not efficient for most of cases.
I think the Next-Generation Internet is little more close to emulate natural systems like DARPA is trying to do. DARPA created ARPANET, the begining of the actual Internet, and they are working in a new Internet emulating systems from the nature. In the same way Maidsafe are doing a great job emulating also natural systems and replacing the blokchain for a trully p2p network without scaling limits.
We will see. The future will be amazing!

Each technology is different, and the growth rate is significantly different from one to others. For example you can't compare Uber growth rate with Bitcoin growth, because Bitcoin needs yet A LOT OF of infraestructure to be developed, we just have the main basis.

There is no hashing power, there is no proof of work. The only way to beat the network is with more than 80% of the resources. Pretty harder than 51% attack with hashing.
SAFE is totally DECENTRALIZED, and autonomus network. SAFE doesn't focus on blockchains, it doesn't use a blockchain, SAFE focus on storing DATA, any kind of data, in a decentralized, secure, private and free way, and blockchains is just a kind of structured data that can be created and stored in the network. 
A coin, is also a kind of data. Safecoin, the token of the network, it's just a special kind of data, and it doesn't use a blockchain, and it's decentralized, totally untraceable (because don't use a blockchain), instant and free.
You should read the docs: 
And the papers:   (The first one is old, there have been a lot of improvements and changes)
And visit the forums and ask your questions, the developers and specialists will answer your questions: 
Btw, Maidsafe began to develop the network 9 years ago, the first patents registered are from 2006. They born before Bitcoin, it's not another "new coin to beat Bitcoin" it's much more, it's a network, to build a decentralized Internet.

Ethereum has been 1 year in development, and it's just a decentralized logical platform using Bitcoin principles.

Maidsafe is a new network paradigm. For the first time in the history, you will be able to approach any computer and log in, and it's as thought it becomes your computer, with all your data, desktop, etc. but without leaving any trace upon logout.
In SAFE network people are self policed, self created, and totally unknown. There is no traces of the uses of the network, there is no traces of the transactions of Safecoin.
You decide who has access to your data, and nobody can cheat your decision.

"But focusing too much on Bitcoin, I think, is a mistake. The real solution is again, how do we get to a point where you don't have to have a direct link between your identity all of the time? You have personas. You have tokens that authenticate each person and when you want to be able to interact with people as your persona in your true name, you can do so. When you want to be able to switch to a persona - a common persona, an anonymous persona, a shared persona, you can do that. When you want to move to pseudonymous persona, you can do that."
That's exactly what SAFE Network do (Maidsafe). Someone should tell him about SAFE.

I understand what you mean, but that's a diffedrent thing. It's obvious than a PUBLIC ledger isn't the best way to hold PRIVATE and anonymous transactions. You can hide them, obfuscate, or use a sidechain, but all of these solutions are just attemps to solve a problem.
In terms of privacy and anonymity, I really think safecoin will be the winning one, if the safe network gain some network effect. Why? because there is not a public chain, there is not a public ledger, there is not a public record that says that this transactions have happened, the transaction is only recorded in the history of the sender and the receiver. That's real privacy. But as usually I will get downvoted because people think safecoin as a competitor of bitcoin, and they are scared to lose his invested money. In fact, Maidsafe is a 9 years old network in development, previous even to bitcoin.

You don't really know what you are talking about. The proposal of ranking nodes it was to avoid a DDOS attack from Tor nodes.

That paper is from 2006, updated in 2009. This paper is focused on the network, not in Safecoin, Safecoin is just the token of the network, the really important thing is how SAFE manage data, no the coin, that is secundary.
The coin is very simple. Money is data, a token is data, the SAFE network store data in a decentralized, perpetual, private and safe way. So Safecoin is just a special kind of inmutable data chunks in which each part can be owned only by one person at the same time, so it's not possible double spend, if you send this data, it's sent forever, it's gone.
There is a paper of Safecoin, but it's outdated and it's not very techinical: 
It's outdated because SAFE doesn't need Transactions Managers anymore and have been removed: 
I know, maybe is not well explained yet, the devs are focusing on simplify the source code, they have changed all the code from C++ to Rust, at the begining that sounds like a crazy thing for me, but they were totally right, it was an awesome decision, Rust is a great language in develop by Mozilla. With the transport from C++ to Rust, the code have beeen simplified from 1million lines to something like 100k lines. After the next sprint, the devs will develop extensive documentation. 
For me it tooks 2 months to understand each part of the networkter you could understand how. If you really want to understand SAFE, learn how the network works, la safecoin works. If you try to understand first how safecoin works, it's going to be really hard.

We need to separate applications from infrastructure here. Safe network provides a communication network. Pretty much everything else is just an application which builds something upon these foundations.
So, we can ask which applications are possible to build and which will be immediately available at launch. However, it is unfair to be dismissive of the technology just because there is a missing application.
Maybe ethereum could store their blockchain on SAFE. Maybe they will create an application directly on top of SAFE. Time will tell.
You can create any application using the SAFE network as communication layer, including smart contracts or whatever... any kind of application, there are no limits.
About privacy, safety and freedom, there is a huge different. For example, if you perform a transaction with safecoin, the transaction is not reflected in a blockchain, there are no traces of that transaction except from the emisor and the receptor. And exactly the same with data, there is no trace of which data you are sharing and with who. A blockchain is a public ledger, and a public ledger is far away from the concept of privacy.
And is more efficient and scalable because doesn't use a blockchain, there is no need to transfer every data to everybody all the time. Blockchains have scalability issues, look at Bitcoin right now and the 1mb debate, and Ethereum will find the same problem.

I'm sorry. Bitcoin won't have NEVER anonymous transactions. Only pseudonymous. If you really want anonymous transactions that's not possible with a blockchain, a PUBLIC ledger, maybe you should look for an alternative like safecoin from safe network, that maybe could work, but it's just a sketch right now.
XT don't do nothing against anonymous transactions. You can still use Tor, if this is what you are talking about. The code to stop DDoS attack coming from Tor only takes effect if you are not using tor, if you are a full node, and if your full node is under attack from Tor, everything else is fud.

It is, because that's not true. Sure that bitcoin blockchain can't work without Bitcoin. But there can be other blockchains, i.e. in the SAFE Network, in development right now, and close to launch, it will be possible create unlimited blockchains for free creating specific structured data, each blockchain can contain unlimited data chunks datamaps and in a private, public, or shared way, also you don't need any measure to protect the blockchain, because any data stored on the network is safe by itself.

"In the very near future (in the next couple of weeks), we will be releasing installers to enable users to download and run a SAFE Network locally on their individual computers. "
"Early(ish) on Friday (26th June) morning, the tireless MaidSafe dev team managed to get the SAFE Network functioning from end to end. This means that a User is able to self-authenticate (create their own username and password, and access the network without the permission of a third party) using the Authentication API via the SAFE Client. During the process, the network’s transport/connection layer (Crust) connects the peer nodes, allowing Routing (the layer that verifies the identity of each node cryptographically) to establish and maintain connections to other network nodes (for more information on how all the components fit together, please visit our wiki). The clients were also able to PUT (store) and GET (retrieve) data."

"Indeed, one of the debt relief options proposed by the I.M.F. is “explicit annual transfers to the Greek budget,” that is, direct payments from other governments to Greece, which it could use to make its debt payments. This, obviously, is a fiscal union.
A second option is extending the grace period, during which Greece would be relieved of the obligation to make interest or principal payments on its debt to European countries, through the year 2053. That’s not a typo. Under this plan, Greece would make no more debt payments until Justin Bieber is 59 years old. This is a fiscal union by another name, since those lengthy and favorable credit terms would save the Greeks money at the expense of Greece’s creditors, most of which now are other European governments or the I.M.F.
The third option floated by the I.M.F., a cancellation of a portion of Greece’s debts, has been fiercely resisted by the German government, even though this is the option that least obviously constitutes a continuing fiscal union. Debt cancellation is a one-time fiscal transfer (if I lend you $100 and then forgive the debt, that’s much like me simply giving you $100), but at least in theory it would be done only once, with Greece expected to stand on its own otherwise. The important exception is that Greece would still need to rely on European governments to lend it money at favorable rates, though not quite as favorable as under the Old Bieber scenario."

The most similar digital to cash will be Safecoin. 
- Totally anonymous and untraceable (there is no blockchain)
- Only the sender and the receiver keep the logs of that transaction.
- Instant confirmed transactions.
- Zero commission in each transaction.
If the network works, Safecoin will be a perfect token for the SAFE network. Outside the SAFE network, I only see Bitcoin with real future. Stellar, NXT, Ripple whatever more... finally they all will die.

This is just the 1st STEP for 21 Inc. It´s just a computer to enable developers work and begin build things with their chip. But the FINAL STEP for 21 Inc. is to establish Bitcoin as an Internet protocol.
"Machine-to-machine payments could be a solution to any number of problems today, Mr. Horowitz said. He mentioned services like Netflix, or media companies. “If I could read stuff on the web for a small amount of money, and didn’t have to open myself up for repeated charging or subscriptions I didn’t want? That’s a relatively straightforward application if you have machine-to-machine payments.”
**"21’s vision involves creating a network of machines that could essentially talk to each other across the bitcoin network**, creating a platform for machine-to-machine payments. It’s similar to an idea floated by IBM IBM +1.36% researchers that **bitcoin could be a key feature of the “Internet of Things**,” a common language connected devices could use to exchange value automatically."

Although all data from the SAFE network are insured, the safecoins are specially treated and controlled even more intense by different managers. For example safecoins are not saved as a normal chunk in the hard disk of multiple nodes, safecoins are saved with multiple copies in memory of some senior managers. This control prevents, for example, the existence of duplicates safecoins since each of them occupies a particular space within space XOR.
Also for any modification (which would be a transfer) fulfills a basic condition which is the atomicity (the process is or is not, but can not stay halfway) and is controlled not only by a single group but is strung with various groups such as the new owner group, needing at least acceptance-testing of 28 nodes in a total of 32 in each of these groups. This makes you need to own more than 87% of the nodes to perform a similar 51% of bitcoin attack (recall that the groups are created randomly, besides what is known as churn (rotation) of different groups are constantly changing).

I'm talking about the chip embebbed in every computer of the world, more than about this computer for 400$ that is just a tool to begin explore their software.
The idea of the chip is simple, every computer will have the chip, every computer will have some satoshis and then they can communicate with each other using satoshis just since the first time you turn them on.
Then you can charge your visitor 1 satoshi for example through 21 Micropayments Server. It's an example. Achievable? Time will tell... I'm big fan of Safe Network, and this kind of things could be done in the network itself, but I find this proposal from 21 pretty interesting aswell for Internet as we know it and IoT. We really need to stop with spam.

What about the efficiency of the miner???
21 INC is 0.16 J/GHS, that miner from Aliexpress for 93$ IS 0.8 J/GHS !!
@_date: 2015-09-10 09:22:01
Pure speculation. Past performance does not predict future.
@_date: 2015-09-23 09:08:50
Yes. All of them are close in terms of efficiency.
Bitfury is developing 16nm nanochips with 0.06 J/GH, but It's not available for the consumer yet.
@_date: 2015-09-27 15:57:00
It will be open source, the CEO said in this subreddit some days ago. Bur for now it's not.
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:52:28
Because of efficiency. It's really important the efficiency, 21INC has 0.16 J/GH that's the best in the market right now. 
If you have 24/7 you will spend 5$ per year in electricity, with a cheap USB miner you will spend 30$. If you want to embed a bitcoin miner in every computer in the world, the consumption has to be lower as possible, if not the people don't want it. And for a mobile phone for example it has to be still like 100 times less.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:46:44
By the way, both of them has a much worse efficiency than 21 ASIC: 0.16 vs 0.25 or 0.51
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:32:25
Too complicated if you ask me.

THIS IS NOT CORRECT AT ALL:
"More striking still is that the Bitcoin system processes only about 100,000 transactions per day (Chart 4)—a small fraction of Visa’s 150 million. The computing power, energy, and carbon footprint required to process all the transactions of the global financial network using blockchain technology would be colossal."
Total missunderstanding about how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:55:17
If the 21 Inc pool is P2P then yes. I suppose they are planning a P2P pool.
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:46:40
And they are not condisdering the efficiency of the miner???
21 INC is 0.16 J/GHS, that miner from Aliexpress for 93$ IS 0.8 J/GHS !! There is nothing in the market below 0.25 J/GHS right now! The price of this miner is much more than 100$
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:12:11
50-125 GHS.  
0.16 Joules / GHs = Best efficiency on the market right now.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:46:01
No. You didn't understand what they are really planning to do. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:33:26
100 GHS * 5 million devices = 50% of the Bitcoin Hashrate.

"Machine-to-machine payments could be a solution to any number of problems today, Mr. Horowitz said. He mentioned services like Netflix, or media companies. “If I could read stuff on the web for a small amount of money, and didn’t have to open myself up for repeated charging or subscriptions I didn’t want? That’s a relatively straightforward application if you have machine-to-machine payments.”

It's normal, when someone listen about any other project automatically downvote, they maybe see Maidsafe as an enemy, an enemy for their investment in Bitcoin, far away from the reality. It's not an enemy nor competitor, just another project trying to give freedom and privacy to the people.

Ok, so send me a link with a miner with 100GHS and 0.16 J/GH for 40$
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:20:05
The consumption is 16 W, thats around 1.5$ per month.
Every chip produces 100GHS, there are 10000000000 devices connected to the internet. Now do the math. If this chip would be right now on every device, the bitcoin total hashrate will be 2000 times bigger than now.

Maidsafe use Proof-of-Resources (Storage, bandwith, and cpu) each node can give those reources to obtain Safecoin in the process called farming. But it's not used to prevent a Sybil attack.
There are some explanations about how to avoid a Sybil attack, last week was a interesting thread on the forum about that. But I can't find it now.

They want to use Bitcoin as a common language to every device connected through the internet to exchange value instantly, since you turn on the device. Also provide a decentralized hashrate to secure the network, if every computer in the world would have this chip, the hashrate of Bitcoin today will be like 100 bigger at least. Each chip has around 100GHS, with 5 million devices you already have 50% of the bitcoin hasharete, and 5 milliones devices is nothing. The consumption is around 15W, that's ok for a PC, it's like a HDD, but is not suitable yet for mobile phones, it should be around 100 times smaller, that's one of the biggest challenges for 21.

Nothing is for sure. Another systems could improve Bitcoin and absorb it as part of the system/network.
But I have no doubt that the future will be decentralized. Decentralized internet, decentralized money, decentralized companies... 
Bitcoin will be probably one of the dominant parts of this new world. Step by step, little by little, and then... AVALANCHE!

A token 100% premined and distributed between 70 persons is not a nice crypto. It's a scam since the first day. If you are really trying to develop a nice and serious crypto you don't distribute a coin between 70 persons. 
And later is just marketing, with new names for every new patch they adds to the coin. 
Not to mention that NXT holders act like sectarians.
Tell me, how much venture capital has been invested in NXT or NXT infrastructure? ZERO. 
Oh, strange for such nice coin.

¿Maidsafe? Maybe you should follow the project more closely.
Almost everything is done. They have written more than 1 millon lines of code. And it's gonna be released soon. Probably even before than Ethereum (or at least before that Ethereum with a GUI).
The Safe Network is right now finishing Testnet2. After that will be Testnet3, much faster and shorter than Testnet2, and then BETA LAUNCH. So they could be launching the Safe Network fully functional including GUI, Safecoin, Vaults, farming... in the next months.. I hope before Autumn.

Thelonious is not a single blockchain, it is a blockchain design. It is purposely designed not to be one blockchain, but millions of them: to complement, rather than compete with, its larger, fully-distributed cousins. Although at its base level Thelonious can deploy a blockchain which has the same parameters as the draft ethereum blockchain, Thelonious was designed with a different set of parameters in mind. We have designed Thelonious as a corporate-, organisation-, family-, or application-specific blockchain to work in conjunction with the Decerver and the other components of Eris Industries’

The price of Maisafecoins tokens is right now x3 times higher than during the IPO. So I don't think the investors have abandoned the project.
Maidsafe will launch very soon the Testnet3 (1 or 2 weeks) , and just after Testnet3 the launch takes place. How much time? It's hard to know, look at Ethereum, they promised deliver at 20 March and now they delayed the launch... SAFE will launch a totally functional product, with GUI, easy for farming and use, probably sooner than Ethereum.  I'm following SAFE from some weeks ago and these guys are not sleeping... they are working like crazy.
I invite to take a look to the forum: 
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:22:07
Great. But I think there is no need for that. Maidsafe, after 8 years of work, is almost ready to launch the Safe Network, a totally anonymous, decentralized and encrypted network where you can build whatever you want like a market. And when I say anonymity, it's real anonymity, we had never seen before this grade of anonymity before. It will be a game changing.
I suppose markets will be one of the first applications there.

I agree with that. But Maisafe is much more than a coin. I'ts the solution to the actual Internet, no more private data leaked, no more hacks... Internet can't be controlled by corporations like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft. Internet has to be own by the people.
Maidsafe doesn't want to replace Bitcoin. Maidsafe wants to replace Internet. Safecoin is just a neccesary token for the network. Only for the network, they are not focused on the global financial system like Bitcoin, just on the network.
Maidsafe was created in 2006 and they has been working and planning the system since then. Now thanks to the fundarising they have a big team working to release the network this year, they have some of the biggest names in C++ for example.
It's totally disruptive and help us in some many ways. The creator David Irvine has been working for 10 years, published everything in GPL3, patented on behalf of the nonprofit Maidsafe Foundation, and also donated all his shares of the Maidsafe company to the Foundation and the workers.
They are doing a great job to make the world a better place. Let's give them a chance. Not to replace Bitcoin, to make Internet a better place.

"Freenet is intended as a network for public sharing and broadcast of files and is not intended to limit access to those files. Therefore, it is not used for private storage of data and does not permit 'ownership' of data in the same way that users can (will) with the SAFE network, which permits both public and private data. AFAIK, Freenet also removes data which is not commonly accessed to save space, I don't think there are any deduplication mechanism in place."  Nick Lambert.
We must add that Freenet doesn't have a token for the network, while Safe has a totally anonymous, untraceable, instant and zero fee token to perform payments in the network. The token doesn't use a blockchain, so it's impossible to track the transactions.

NXT could be distributed for free and with transparency like another POS coins (NEM, NODE, CLAMS and many others). There is no need to run an IPO to get 23 BTC, except you want to buy your own coins for free.
Devs could actually have bought 80% of NXT coins in the IPO.

No one could complain in a few years that didn't have the opportunity to buy. They had it in fron them for a long time, and they couldn't see it.

So... He is ranked  in Kindle store. So he is selling around 100 books per day (probably more) at 17$, gaining 12$ per book.
So 1200$ per day only with digital version.
And he wants that Bitcoin community work for free for him? 
A - He should pay translators working with transifex.  
or B - He should sell the book for free.
Just my opinion.

Interesting. Thank you for the answer :) 1000 bits @_date: 2015-02-15 19:54:07
This is not related to Bitcoin. It's related to unregulated and unprofessional exchanges.
Btw: 
@_date: 2015-02-18 09:46:52
But one day, it will be possible. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:56:10
That's true. Maybe someone else should go to the chinese police
@_date: 2015-10-08 20:06:41

That's nice! Good to see Bitcoin there :D
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:56:43
Ok. Bye bye Kraken. Never more. I will close my account there ASAP.

7170 BTC got stolen from our cold wallet in the transaction:
720 bounty for chasing it back.
All wallets have been shut down and withdrawals of unaffected coins will be arranged later.
I suppose I lost my bitcoins on Bter...
HOW THE HELL SOMEONE CAN STEAL YOU 7500 BTC FROM A COLD WALLET BTER??? 
You don't even use a Trezor or multisignatures?
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:37:27
Don't feed the troll.
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:23:58
The 7300 BTC have been moved into 1000 btc addresses.

It was worth it some months ago...

I don't know. Here is some more detailed information:

Bter.com is an alt-BITCOIN. Is the only place where you can trade NODE , or NuShares for example. 
Bter is not for Fiat-Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-02-15 10:36:58
What's going on!?
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:45:30
The bug can make bitcoind node consume 100% CPU and ridiculous amount of Memory like 11 GIG. Even kill the node.
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:23:45
They already reported to the police.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:51:14
HOLD! For sure.

SPAM. Iota is a scam, it should not be here.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:47:24


Yes. They have to. The police can order it, it's stolen money.
