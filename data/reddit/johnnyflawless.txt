Flawless victory.

Fuck that. I throw it in their face every chance I get. Many of them are freaking out  now and wishing they bought. Bunch of suckasses.

Psh. Bought my first .1 at 19.5k. Saw it at 12k and calmly bought another .1. Like a sir.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:09:24
Actually, I was kicking myself for buying at 19.5k and when it dropped to 12k, I bought more :D
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:13:15
Yep. It's like I bought all of it at 16k. I'm fine with that. That's when I originally wanted to get in, but I waited for a weekend dip like an idiot.

Damn. Someone's a Dr. Disrespect hater.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:05:28
Well it's only 1 coin. Up 7k. Not sure if worth a legendary status lol. Talk to my brother who has pumped 30k into the damn thing.

Wealth should never be distributed perfectly evenly. Earn your shit. Fuck socialism.

See my previous post about how I treated it as a savings account I couldn't touch. I didn't care about price flux at all. I knew it was going to return and go up. We are eventually heading to a one world government and one world currency unfortunately. I think BTC will be the entry.

I had a few friends that got hyped around Dec 2017, bought....and panic sold.  Had to explain the concept of HODLing to them, but they were scared and were looking for a quick buck.  They don't understand how volatile Bitcoin is.
