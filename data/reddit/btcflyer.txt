But that assumes you dont have/want to spend BTC and need to buy it first. Of course that makes zero sense. But with the same argument you could say shops shouldn't accept them, as you need to buy them first in order to load the card with them.
Think of it less as a prepaid card, and more as a "universal gift card" you can use in any store you like... ;)

If somebody, even as a student, gets tired/stressed after one hour of flying, they shouldn't be near a cockpit to begin with.

Yes I did. With &gt; 4.000 hrs in command on Jets I guess I know what I am talking about

Similar yes, same no. But why worse? Can you fund any other prepaid credit card with BTC? Also- can you fund it online and use only once? I guess you can use it only once, but that might not be worthwhile as the fee to issue the prepaid (physical) card would not make this very economical.

If you would have a physical card that's also possible. Shall I rather look into this service?

Ever did a proficiency check in a simulator? They throw constant emergencies at you for 4 hours! Apart from that, I have been in enough real world emergency situations in planes to know for a fact that one needs to be more stress resistant than being exhausted after 1 hour of PPL flight training. 
Edit: oh sorry, please excuse my commend. I have seen in the flying reddit that you are a student pilot. Of course you know more about that than somebody who did this as a full time job for more than 12 years. I just hope I never share the same airspace with you if you are too fatigue after 1 hour of flying. Happy landings ;)

Thanks. Would that not also be a nice withdrawal option for exchanges? Imagine Btcchina could offer that- than it's less problems getting money of of china. Or Mt. Gox USD withdrawals would be super easy for everybody all of a sudden.
