Use following tool. Mycelium apparently has some issues with restoring old backups.
This allows you to produce a WIF key, which should be usable in new mycelium.
Let me know over PM, if you'll need help to run it.
EDIT: Attached a guide
Go to backuputil/bin directory and execute
backuputil.bat encryptedKey PASSWORD
backuputil.bat xEncGXICZE1_eVYfGWDioNu_8hA6RZzep4XqwPGRtcKb01MDg3s1XFntJYI9Dw QDTDXOYFBXBKKMKR
This will show you "Private key (Wallet Import Format)".
Send it to your mobile phone (using chat or whatever)
Copy it into clipboard
Open Mycelium &gt; Accounts &gt; Key+ icon &gt; Advanced &gt; Import (this should allow you import from clipboard)
1) Pre-built version (I built it straight from mycelium repo like 30 minutes ago)
Here you can download ready-to-use backuputil. 
2) However if you don't trust these binaries (which I totally respect), here is a guide how to compile your own.
Download and install Android Studio
In the 2nd step of welcome wizard choose "Custom"
Check "NDK" in the next step and let the installation finish
Dowload zipped backuputil source code (green button on the top)
Unzip it and using command line go to backuputil from the zip file above
Type "gradle build" into command line
Go to newly created folder build/distributions
Unzip backuputil.zip
