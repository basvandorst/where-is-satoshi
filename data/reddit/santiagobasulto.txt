Yes, if you see the analysis as "I want to trade bitcoin with this strategy and I'll made billions" you're in a problem. But the intention was educational: how simple it is to pull data, visualize it and create a simple strategy.
If you use the same concepts with something a little bit more robust it can be a different story. For example, finding a pair of cointegrated cryptos (BTC and BCH for example) and hedging them, and basing the strategy on a given number of z-scores above and below of the mean. The same code as shown is the post is required for this, with a much more robust strategy.

I'm not an expert, so take my comments with a grain of salt. Candles are just an "aggregation" of prices over a period. During those 4 hours the price had many fluctuations, but for "simplicity" we only care about 4 of them: open, close, **high** and **low**. Usually, if you're doing one of these analysis you'll care more about the high and low prices. For example, if your strategy looks to buy cheap you might care about the low price. This is always relative, because even these prices are an average of the market orders (what people was willing to pay). For better backtesting you should probably look at the orderbook. Most exchanges have a public endpoint on their API with their orderbook. Most also have a websocket API, which updates you with the changes as the orders are placed.

What's the problem with that?

I tried circle and it worked really well! Thanks a lot! You don't realize how much you've helped me. Thanks again.
