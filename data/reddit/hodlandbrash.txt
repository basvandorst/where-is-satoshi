What if you traded back and forth from USD, but you lost money
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:02:51
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:01:40
How will they find out if you just don't report it? And isn't there a limit to how much you must have gained in order to have to file it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:47:44
Still not working :(

People like that are smart enough not to expose themselves
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:52:44
So how far could this take us down?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:30:09
Can we find out who it is and kick his ass?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:41:07
wtf where?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:49:28
Greg sold for our gains
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:20:09
Based on the strong polarizing views of each side, I do not think so. There is no way both will keep going up, if each side keeps attacking one another in this manner.

A simple google search goes a long way my friend
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:14
I wouldn't even pay that much lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:36:52
I own 1000 Bitcoins. Too bad they're all on GDAX!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:56
look at his username
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:55
You weren't there when I had Chipotle for the first time
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:35:33
No human is THAT good at keeping secrets. Especially if you literally created a currency with a market cap in the trillions. I would at least be telling some chick at a bar so I could get laid or something.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:24:49
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:48:13
Someone just posted this lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:20:47
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:53:45
But how is this gonna be "free money" for us?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:02:04
Obviously someone who bought it for greed
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:11:46
How do you calculate that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:29
she said we're out of bread.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:06:37
Seems like it's correcting right now lmao
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:38
Is there a reason? Did something happen?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:04:58
But it's not just Bitcoin though. All altcoins are going down as well....
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:53:59
are you drunk
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:20:41
Lol you're not gonna get that profit. Coinbase charges up the ass with fees. You'll be lucky if you get half of that profit back. I would just HODL for a while longer man.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:19:45
Oh. Nah, never heard of it
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:03:59
No no no, you got it all wrong. It's beep boop boop bop boop beep!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:40:08
Definitely. Go into your account settings.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:54:01
I THINK MR KRAbS IS A roBOt
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:15:33
Why would that be good for us? Another Altcoin for competition?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:11:07
I'm chill dude. I asked a simple question. I think YOU need to "chill the fuck out." Anyways, thanks for your answer.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:00
OmG WoW!!! So SmArT!!!!!
Lol, you were wrong. Stop posting your shitty videos and move on with your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:14:35
Woah. That's spooky.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:44:17
Lol I literally just had Sushi
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:45:28
There's a fork happening soon
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:09:59
From my extensive amateur research in the past 30 minutes, I've gotten the hunch that this is all a scam to get SegWit2x futures to trade really high so a handful of people can profit off of it. Seems like market manipulation to me.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:50:28
If your scenario is to come true, I'm assuming that is what is happening wight now. It's been very steadily dropping with very little resistance for hours.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:13:52
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:36:04

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:47
I keep hearing that this is years away. Is that true? If so, why does it take so long?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:18
learn what a fucking bubble is man
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:04:48
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:03:20
Any idea what time the fireworks start?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:43
Ok. Nice username by the way.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:12:44

We are Bitcoin core.....
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:14
Is that good or bad
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:10:40
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:46:05
Go for it. They're really cheap on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:37:50
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:37:19
Yeah. I actually witnessed this certain drop in real time on GDAX as I was trading. Some dude sold a big amount right at a large sell wall and shit just fell like dominos.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:27:43
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:05:20
I bought at 19.5k!
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:52:11
I'm not sure if i would view it that way. There's a difference between a healthy drop and an unhealthy one. Dropping that much in value would be the sign that Bitcoin was indeed a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:59:00
that guys scamming hard
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:38:16
Or maybe they have no fucking idea how to run their shit business
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:12:07
Yeah, I'm planning on it. Whenever I see all coins going down at once, I know it's going to recover.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:16
lol same. I'm at work
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:48:18
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:14:49
Grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:21
But I read somewhere that some guy named Jihad or something practically owns the Bitcoin Ledger and works for BCH. Couldn't he purposely sabatoge us?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:31
Didn't China ban Cryptocurrency? How the fuck are they supposed to manipulate the price so drastically if they don't possess any XD
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:13
it was cancelled
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:50:51
But we do get free altcoins though, right? Isn't that something that happens during any Bitcoin fork?
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:06:08
Because he owns Bitcoin and not Ripple
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:27
I know. There's usually reasons though. I thought maybe there was an exchange hack or something
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:54:15
i don't even know what sand is
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:52
No need to make this personal dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:31:42
Only if you were holding during the Fork in August. I'm not aware of any happening in April...
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:38:16
Yeah, may just be Asia trading though. It seems to slightly spike like this every night or so
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:41:34

Geez Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, will ya?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:17
Is this actually going to happen? Isn't bad if so many of Satoshi's coins are just handed back?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:45:42
No fucking way. Bullshit. I'm gonna google it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:48:47
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:53
I don't understand though. Won't the purpose of forks be to create a better version. How will our version gain value if many new versions are created?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:01
look at his username
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:19:34
I know of two off the top of my head. cex.io and Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:51:27
So he can't really do anything to sabotage us?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:31:57
I will donate you 10 Satoshis for this post!
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:13:37
I'm just chillin bro. You're the one freaking the fuck out.

But I read somewhere that some guy named Jihad or something practically owns the Bitcoin Ledger and works for BCH. Couldn't he purposely sabatoge us?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:53:30
It didn't crash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:40:46
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:22:04
try Proactive. Worked well for my sister.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:55
I honestly can't really tell the difference between Sushi unless it REALLY stands out. It all tasted pretty yummy though.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:36:20
Yeah. Honestly, I'd rather just not know. Kinda like the Master Chief's face. It's all part of the mystery &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:09:46
Spongebob: AGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:50:17
They're taking advantage of the fact that we are decentralized. Which was the fucking point of Bitcoin and Crypto's in the first place!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:55:37
You as well my friend
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:15:03
SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU MEDIOCRE CLARINET PLAYER
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:39:35
You didn't have to upload a picture of your DL for Coinbase? That was one of the first things I had to do before I started buying....
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:33:55
LOL. Don't order that shit. It doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:45:22
sand corn?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:50:59
Lol is that really you? I thought it was Andrew Jackson.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:26:28
Bro. We should convert to Judaism. Just me and you. It'll be a blast!

@_date: 2017-12-27 11:28:18
It was a passive joke man. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:41:36
If I delete it, will that prevent people from trying to hunt me down for my BTC? I don't want the money. I just want to be safe.
EDIT: FOUND A WALLET.dat file! I deleted it right away. Thanks for the help guys.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:09:28
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:15:51

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:33
Where are you seeing this? I can't find it on their twitter
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:08:25
You're amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:12:10
NEW YEAR, NEW YOU!
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:55:13
I'm down for some cheap BTC. I'm ready to buy more.
I had a ton of Sushi today. I'm ready for an Asian dump
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:43:42
SEC. It is inevitable. SEC has been cracking down on Crypto exchanges for doing much less than what Coinbase did today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:45:02

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:01:05

Why not just change your phone number?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:56:52
....we are Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:04:14
Can't wait to buy some more!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:43:48
I'm in. Let's do it. Just me and you! How do we get started?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:16:52
Binance fucking blows dude
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:17:24
Do not start trading. Trust me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:10:23
You can't. It's only for Crypto trades. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:05:54
Prove it. Send it to me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:46:39
it was cancelled. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:53:38
Why do you say that
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:42
Nope. It was hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:04:19
I literally just showed that I do not
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:22:50
SegWit is a SegBITCH
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:04:49
Damn. They should at least clean it a little then
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:55:05
Um, what about an Audi screams "MILLIONAIRE!"?

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:26:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:01:05
at least you have a heart
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:29:24
....but the coins are already banned lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:24:23
Oh shit. My daughter's a minor :\
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:14:22
Grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:49:35

Oh yeah it it will dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:45:18
What? Is that wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:51:05
Nevermind i got it. You were right. And I'm actually setting limits so I can buy when it gets to a certain low point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:46:00
It's definitely gonna go to ______ before it hits _______
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:26:47
Then why is the price rising on all other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:56:23
Yeah I know lol. I bought it for myself.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:40:05
Slide in her Non-Drowsy DM's
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:02
Insider trading can also involve securities. The SEC has already cracked down on Crypto exchanges that have been involved in fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:39:21
Is it heading to 10k right now? It's been decreasing for hours.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:32:09
FUCK YEAH!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:52:32
About to go into the 13 thousands
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:01
I'm not saying that it is because the investigation has started. I am saying that it is because the peeps at Coinbase know an investigation is incoming.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:09:38
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:50
Oh thank god, I thought the red was buys lol. So the green is the buys and red is sells?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:38:17
I think I mined quite a few blocks if I remember correctly
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:48:43
I had a Spicy Mixed box from the grocery store. Spicy Tuna, Salmon and California. It was pretty damn good for grocery store Sushi 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:34
