wrong again.. you need a high-end gpu ( gtx1080 is around $500).. also you need electricity ...
Are you a miner? I'm mining alts from 2013.. ( and still I'm mining with few rigs and asics..)
Right now, the best way to get crypto is buying them... 
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:23:49
For sure not!! You can't mine that amount in one month!! it's out of the discussion!!

Then you're very young.. Remember what Georges Clemenceau said about leftists... political science?  lol ..that means marxist science.. That explain all.. Have a nice day!

Paypal are not nazis but commies! That's the goal of leftists, implementation of the communism. ( Remember what Marx said...)
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:30:23
Well, you're very young.. As I said, you don't know anything..You don't understand the ideologies ( probably because your source of information is wiki or other BS sites). Paypal isn't a state ( lol) Paypal acting like a super communist state!! Thaaa use your brain... You don't understand the nationalism.. You have to educate yourself.. Humans are competitive!! Bear in mind! Also there is a constant need for natural resources. Right now while you can use the phone/pc etc.. someone is  dying from hunger because you use their resources. This is what I name " an utopia brain" all leftist suffer from the same disease.. they have no chance...
And what the hell is edl?

Just google it "silicon" or "silica sand" mine.. And we are talking about "green energy" as photovoltaics.. lol

Then you have to learn and understand what is fascism, nazism, communism/bolshevism and why all of these ideologies have the same roots ( Marxism). Remember that Mussolini was a great supporter of Marx.  Ideologies that promote the " new man" idea, are not right-wing ideologies (conservative).  Maybe you're too young for this... In the 50's my communist country implemented the Pitesti Experiment ( based on Tavistock Institute and Frankfurt School ideas) where tens of thousands of right-wing dissidents were tortured and killed. We'll not forget that! Left-wing ideologies are a cancer for humanity, in the end you'll  have no rights, no freedom, no freedom of speech.

Well said !!!
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:48:04
I Agree!! I'm from Romania also... they should never mention "communism"!!
Communism is a cancer!!

Use your brain, read books not BS on internet, educate yourself.. only the diffrent things between fascism and bolsevism were the economical part. The socio-cultural part was the same and that part is most important.. Probably you never asked yourself why you can still own properties and means of production.. Are you from USA? or any occidental country? You know nothing then..you should have to live in south-eastern Europe to understand what  fascism and communism is,  and why those are the same BS. Bear in mind that fascism and communism are two sides of the same coin.. Putting fascism in the right spectrum of ideologies was o big mistake ( a deliberate mistake made it by Marxist historians ) Also how many right-wing socialist or workers( labor) parties do you know? No one! Do you think communism is only internationalist? no ( look at Romania, Czechoslovakia, both countries were led by nationalist communist parties). Maybe you'll say that fascism is a state oriented ideology ( which is right) and communism is not ( which is wrong! ) It doesn't matter if a state is named Google, Paypal or USA... At the end it becomes a "superstate" inside of which you'll have no rights, no freedom etc..  I see you here on bitcoin subreddit, how can you accept Bitcoin as a leftist? bitcoin pollutes, bitcoin creates inequality ( I have more bitcoins than you, and always I'll have more bitcoins than you..) In the crypto world you can own the means of production..( which creates inequality according to Marx), Well, Bitcoin promotes the decentralization idea, but in a decentralized system you can not silence a man ( like Paypal did it )..

I think you confuse cboe bitcoin futures with bakkt and fidelity. Also you confuse SEC with CFTC....
Please note that phisically btc contracts are not the same with btc "paper" contracts ( which are trading via cboe/cme). When you run a btc phisically contract you have to own these phisically btc ( you need to have a custodian service).
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:59:02
ha ha... then you don't understand what is bakkt and fidelity...
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:20:19
* You forgot Bakkt and Fidelity, guys..
