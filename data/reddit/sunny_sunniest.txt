Yes, if you're mining, you have the potential to be taxed twice. First when you received the payout from your pool, counted as income and valued at the price of BTC when you received it. Second, if you sell it, it's taxed as a capital gain using the same value you used before as your cost basis.

For anyone interested. 
The "taking longer than 7000 ms" is overheating, I just have no idea why the lights don't react as they are supposed to. 
Adding a longer work queue fixed the pool not sending data issue.

I will look into it. Apparently deepbit is in Germany, my buddy that uses deepbit lives in Seattle, and I am in the Southern US.    
  
I am going to try increasing the queue size from 1 to probably 3 and see if that does it, else I will look for another pool.

I have a hundred educated things to say about the state and regulation, positives and negatives. However, it's not even worth the effort in this thread as it's become nothing but the same naive, childish, anarchist BS.  
@_date: 2013-03-18 18:19:31
They're not a scam. They're definitely new to the manufacturing process, but not a scam. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 00:34:58
Right, because it's too hard to even come up with smaller groups that apply in this context. Let's just group them all together in one blanket statement. Who cares about accuracy and context? Then again, that's not your goal. You just want to push your anarchist BS agenda and find others to who agree with you. I am sure it makes you feel good inside that your worldview is so simple. I understand, it is really tough to think critically. You better not try it, it might make your head hurt.

They are making a point from the perspective of businesses and investors. This is something that is often forgot in discussions about Bitcoin's expansion. If we want to attract more businesses to accept BTC and more investors, especially non tech people, there needs to be legitimacy. You can rail on regulation until your face turns blue, but the fact is; BTC will never gain widespread acceptance without it.

Right, because the "government" is one giant monolithic unit that acts as one head, united, and with a clear and defined goal of oppressing you. It's in no way splintered by funding, law, levels of government, jurisdictions, politics, or the individuals that work there.   
If you want to go through life deriving simple understandings so you can be happy with your "understanding" and pretending you "get it," have fun with that.  
@_date: 2013-03-15 20:11:36
The only thing you've told me here is that they are behaving like many other successful and legitimate companies.  
It is highly unlikely they are a scam. No scammer would ever go through this much trouble.  
The level of "proof" people are demanding from BFL is utterly ridiculous. No company would ever put up with that much abuse. Thus BFL's behavior at CES and on bitcointalk. I don't blame them at all. Actually, I encourage them to continue being crass and dismissive.   
You have to understand that the nature of BTC draws in a crowd of people who are on the more paranoid end of the spectrum and these people are going to behave accordingly. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:42:30
W/e BTC ends up being (currency, commodity, or something else), when there is an exchange from USD to BTC, that is some sort of sale and is subject to tax and or regulation of some sort.   
The US government has in no way done anything to BTC, it is simply regulating it's jurisdiction, the USD. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 16:38:05
As you can see, people hate them. I do not. There are many reasons why people dislike them and very few of their reasons are legitimate. I received 2 of their FPGAs in October and since then they have paid for 75% of their total cost.  
As to the ridiculous amount of delays they have experienced? I'm not concerned. As all that really matters with the ASICs is that I get them around the same time as everyone else.  
I think it's hilarious Avalon said they were going to ship 300 units and there are what, something like 10 confirmed received units?  
I'm not going to address every single complaint as I would just as soon waste my time arguing with a conspiracy theorist.  
So they didn't have a working product for CES. Yeah, they weren't ready. So what? Get over it. If you are frustrated by their timeline and the delays, then cancel your order. If you don't have an order and think it's funny they brought an empty box, it's getting old. They didn't have their product ready, what would you propose they should do instead? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:13:35
Plus the Secret Service who used to be under Dept. of Treasury and know a thing or two about money transfers.  
Also, just about every single government agency employs a federal agent. Most agencies have something called the OIG - Office of Inspector General, where they have (although in small numbers) federal agents who carry a badge and a gun. They could be a federal agent for the Social Security Administration and investigate internal fraud/theft, or fraud with SSA.

True, I'm not saying this is exactly the case, but this is an example of a likely scenario, one that is far more likely than a war on BTC. As if FLEAs have the money or resources to do such a thing.

False. Fincen represent agencies and departments which have been created under law to perform certain tasks. They can perform these tasks also under the rule of law.

You're right, my guess is that Millum Siggum LLC (or w/e it's called) messed up somewhere. It's possible they didn't comply with the investigation, or maybe they didn't comply fast enough (they probably couldn't get the information to DHS because they were being DDoSed haha.)  
DHS is the 2nd biggest department in the US. They have multiple agencies under them who have a sizable amount of agents: ICE and Secret Service being the largest. FLEOs (like an FBI agent) investigate federal crimes. If something happened that crossed state and or international boundaries, an agent from any number of agencies could be investigating. When they get a court order for something like shutting down MS LLC it just goes under the DHS name.  
I think you make a good point, my scenario was just a theory/example of how a common occurrence is probably responsible. There are holes, but yes, I can tell you with a high certainty DHS (as the umbrella organization) does investigate this stuff.

In Mt. Gox, under 'add funds' and then selecting 'bitcoin,' I copied the address into blockchain. Blockchain says:  
Which means the BTC should show up in my account right?
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:02:23
First, lets assume (and probably safely) that this case is being investigated by a task force/field office/or team of agents. DHS rarely does anything as an agency, they are not monolithic.  
In my scenario there are 2 likely assumptions.  
1.) The people involved don't know about BTC, or don't fully understand it. OR  
2.) They understand it, however, this isn't like money laundering through your typical bank which FLEOs having been investigating for a 100 years. This is new, they don't have established processes. Since they don't, they are likely to freeze as much as they can, ergo playing it safe, making sure nothing gets through the cracks.

Anyways, you misunderstand me. I am in no way trying to convince you of anything. It's a fools errand in any argument or debate to try and convince the other person to change their mind. I'm fighting for the opinions of other people reading this.

I'm sorry to say that you are way off. The worldview you've framed of "government" is psychologically useful to you, but wrong. It allows you to make sense of the complex world around you, it allows you to assign blame for bad things happening, and it allows you to have an enemy giving you some sense of purpose.  
I'm being harsh, but accurate. "THE GOVERNMENT" is not a very useful label when intelligently discussing just about anything. 
@_date: 2013-01-11 16:20:01
What a joke. Why would you go through all the trouble to upload a cut video taken out of context? If you don't have confidence in BFL, then state your case. Pulling stunts like this make you look pathetic.  
Or is the real issue that you have stated your case and plenty of people don't agree with you? That must drive you crazy.  
Also, I love that BFL treats people this way. Their attitude is dichotomous between respectful people and the group of bitcointalk people who think everything is a conspiracy. If the ASIC's aren't build in their living room then they must not exist. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:18:42
Reminds me of this guy.  
He has continually been reposting BFL ASICs for over 2 months and bidding on his own auctions with fake accounts.

The government is one body? It's monolithic? It moves as one? Maybe I don't understand. Perhaps you should explain it to me. Either it moves as one and is monolithic, or it seems rather silly to talk about 'government' in this context.

In March when these things started hitting ebay there was about 20 of them at any one time, this guy had his ASICs set to auction, not buy it now, and for some reason all of his were going for 4 - 6 times the price of every other auction. Even ones with lower order numbers. I mean come on, with an ebay name like: "hotstuff?"
