This kind of response just adds to the bullshit, dumb ass.

First, thanks for doing this.  It’s great to see that some of this “new wealth” that is coming from this Bitcoin “transfer of wealth” that is taking place is being used to the well-being of so many people.
I’m submitting a humble, 6 yr. old non-profit named the Agni Institute for your consideration.  It’s members are spread throughout the US and UK and come together to focus their energies on advancing our common knowledge and progress along 4 main lines: environmental preservation and restoration, gender equality, understanding “thought energy” and its transmission, and ways in which electromagnetic radiation can positively influence health.
As a biologist myself, it’s this last one that has really captured my imagination.  Other scientific groups and labs have been able to show that electromagnetic frequencies, when tuned to the correct frequency, can resonate with a specific living cell and shatter it, much like a musical note, if just the right pitch, can shatter glass.  It’s the same concept.  
Groups have had success in shattering cancer cells even.  This would be the end goal and ultimate measure of success of this research: a non-invasive, zero side-effect, and inexpensive way to eliminate tumors from the human body.  There is promise along these lines, but money for better equipment is lacking.
Thank you for your consideration.  Here is there website where you can learn more and/or donate:  
Here is a video explaining more of the science of cell fracturing using electromagnetic frequencies:

So when does the difficulty "switch back" to what it was before?
