They're selling the porn.com domain name.. not any actual content or business. Is it really worth $50m for a site that I'd never even heard of until it was mentioned in connection with bitcoin? Is the recent free press worth $50m? Doubtful. It's a nice domain, but on the other hand the domain market is about to meet an avalanche of new gTLDs that will likely devalue existing ones such as this.

I don't think it did, actually. What it did do is open up online video to a much larger audience. Pirates still pirate, and in many ways torrents are still a superior product.
I'm not sure there's a large number of potential pay porn watchers who have been holding back only because they're terrified of the site showing up on their credit card.. maybe in the older generations? 
The only possible advantage I do see for the consumer is the impossibility of recurring billing.. but have they really left money on the table simply by pushing recurring billing too hard? Have they been doing it wrong this whole time?

Not necessarily.. they could be money laundering for other criminal businesses. The payment processors in particular are a nice profit centre usually based in tax havens.. they can then fund lots of fake accounts using prepaid debit cards as a way to move dirty cash offshore. Non-physical goods are good for this since there's nothing to deliver and if all the billing addresses turn out to be fake they can just explain it away by saying 'oh yea people don't like to give real information to a porn site'. I'm not saying all porn sites are fake and maybe even some of the fake ones would be marginally profitable without the money laundering.. but I do suspect it plays a major role.
