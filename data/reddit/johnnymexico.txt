2. 1ea92ad1-22bd-4580-8e56-fde8a3af0e0e

I always include the fee. CampBX didn't have the option, at least, from what I could see.

Hello Bitinstant,
Can you please help me? I have two orders over a day old that have not been fulfilled.  I submitted tickets to your support, but still have no response. I just want to be assured you have my orders in a queue somewhere... My order numbers are:
Please and thank you!

You rock! I have put through 4 orders with you guys, 2 of the 4 went through great and I'd LOVE to use you as my go-to BTC supplier. If these order numbers are incorrect, I took screenshots of each confirmation page I will happily email you. Please PM me if you have any questions

Even though the other transactions, with no fees, went through just fine?

Is there any way to see where a wallet resides? i.e. XXXXXX address is owned by mtgox.
