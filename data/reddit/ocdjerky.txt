Were starting with a 5 flavour beef launch and will expand this by 2016. We developed some recipes that work magic with croc and kangaroo (croc is my favourite).
We will have some other products launch later in the year but unlikely the roo in 2015. 
If you really do love it we can put you on our taste tester list and when the recipe is being refined you can tell us how were doing?

Yes Squarespace stops us and stripe are only processing BTC for those with US bank accounts. We have been in contact with them and they tell us the only option for now is to embed code or wait until late May for their custom App.
I agree, this post could have been presented better but unfortunately we don't have a PR team and my experience is limited. I did my best and will learn quickly.
I disagree with your thoughts on the phrasing. Bitcoin means more to us than a unit of value. Its the idea, community and beliefs. Were partnering with bitcoins culture and ecosystem. True, we are not partnering with the dollar, AMEX or Mastercard. Were just going to use their services.
I can see the sense in your second point although it is clear under the icon "not quite yet". We will remove the current icon and replace it with the standard "B" logo explaining the implementation.
The ann bar: "Come from the bitcoin community..." was a good idea at the time. Right now over %95 of our traffic comes from the bitcoin community. The remainder is our close family and friends checking in to see how the page is coming along. If it was possible someone else found our page and ordered then I assume they just got lucky and scored a 28g. You are correct, it could have confused someone. (I will enable comments in cart checkout)
I see your in the AU and want a small order. Your right, a 50g bag can be sent for much less than options allow. Rather than leaving it optimised for larger orders we should customise small batch too. Were going to put some time in and update the cart.
Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate the constructive post and are implementing the changes suggested.
We noticed you were after a domestic 50g? Were going to send that to you free of charge as your ideas are well received.
I would like to know how to deliver  coupons, that way I could PM you a code and you could shop with it. Im going to take a look now. EDIT: They don't allow...

Thanks for the recommendation! Im going to see if we can embed it into our Squarespace site 
@_date: 2015-04-13 07:12:53
Oh I see. Singapore is next door but because its international our cart  charges at the flat rate. We really need to customise our shipping costs to continents. This is where wordpress plugins would be amazing! 
*Good news,
I just lowered it to $16 across the board for now. Im also adding a free shipping option if a minimum order quantity is met. I have to crunch some numbers first.

Evening Detective,
We have spoken to our accountants quite often. They are confident we have it figured out. I actually think our BTC sales will be the easiest thanks to the blockchain. Haha, yes they charge hourly.
I should make it clear to AU customers how we manage the %10 GST. Right now we are absorbing it but this may change in future. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:06:05
We thought it made sense because we don't just want to "accept" bitcoin as payment. We want to build a relationship with the community, strengthen the bitcoin economy, increase adoption and educate people about it.
By saying we "partner" with bitcoin I imagine bitcoin as more than a blockchain. To me its the whole package. We use bitcoin but we partner with the community and everything bitcoin stands for.

"From the rugged and pristine Kimberley and Pilbara regions where the cattle are range run to the grass pastures of the Great Southern and South Western regions" -Harvey Beef.
We also have two other suppliers that source from greater Perth and northern regions. Family owned businesses.
Our beef is MSA graded for high quality assurance. If we used a low quality or ungraded beef cut, you could tell the difference. Most jerky companies say its fine to use low quality beef but we disagree.  
Bitcoin discount? Yes, %10 and absorbed shipping costs (wordlwide shipping). Still manual trades until our cart is implemented. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:14:58
Ok thats what were going to do! I'll add that within 24hrs
@_date: 2015-04-13 07:02:01
When a large company like Dell or overstock accepts BTC as payment, its certainly newsworthy.
Were only smalltime but its not everyday you get a company throwing a BTC on their 140,000 units of packaging, openly working with the community to increasing adoption and advertise. Theres only two of us right now and we will listen to everything you guys have to say.
Right now, the community is shaping our business and greatly influencing our actions. 
We might be small today but when we grow bitcoin will grow with us and become a larger part of our business.

Were going to get you eventually!
We have refined a recipe using tofu for our vegetarian friends. Nobody does it yet and we want to include you guys! It tastes amazing and everyone loves it. Beautiful texture, flavour and bite. We wont release it until later this year but keep an eye out ;)
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:35:01
Hello, 
Good to hear from you!
Are you saying we can use shopify to sell in squarespace with BTC? Im googling this right now..
Ps. If you really want to order some, we started manual trades on the bitcointalk goods thread. Creating a little buzz and making some new friends! 
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:20:16
We have adjusted our shipping from the previous price and are absorbing some of the cost. It seems a lot of people dont like to pay shipping.
I spoke to my partner and we agreed to find a solution. Would you order with free shipping if minimum order quantity was greater than 1kg?
 
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:41:46
Hello BraydenH,
Love the detective work! Yes, we are a real Australian company led by two excited jerky lovers! 
You found me, well done Im impressed! I am the crazy bitcoiner that led us here :)
Initially we decided on a limited partnership for ease of setup and low cost. After spending considerable time with accountants we found the benefits of a company structure outweigh the partnership and continued to dissolve it and restructure.
You can see on our contact page our location address, email, names and mobile numbers. I didn't even think to add our ACN! Our factory in Kardinya is our production, packaging and distribution centre. Thanks for the heads up on the brown, we will consider changing it.
Its good to see people actually verify the legitimacy rather than blindly believe. Were going to add some more information and start a blog with photos of our progress to launch. Its been a surprising journey and it would be cool to share the strory. 
Don't forget to check out our facebook page too! 
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:20:49
We ship worldwide ;)

Hey Jason,
Good to see aussies making a name in the bitcoin space. Were going to check out your website and see how it can help us. My next holiday will be paid in bitcoin thanks to you guys! 
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:19:53
Thats a great link for info. Just had a read but it seems that we need to embed a code or widget into our site. Squarespace use stripe (which have BTC payments) but they haven't implemented yet and only allow US bank accounts to use it. Theres another, "coinbase" but its over a month off 
Wordpress is awesome! When I did start I could see the power. Those plugins and the SEO options blew me away. Squarespace dont even allow custom SSL certs and I know its killing our rankings..
Looks like I'll take your suggestion and check out godaddys wordpress gateway! How long did it take you to develop? 
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:36:19
Thanks mate,
We will be throwing in a few extra 28s to any recent Melbourne orders! 
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:30:10
Thanks for the heads up, were going to get onto that Monday afternoon. Its exciting to imagine being in a newsletter or an article. I hope we interest them with bitcoin and jerky! 
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:35:06
Hey mate,
Your saying we do it all with Shopify? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:04:12
We just got your order, thank you for paying in Bitcoin!
I noticed that you didn't use our "bitcoin" %10 off code so Im going to throw some extra packs in there for your dad ;) 
Keep us posted on how the jerky works with the new diet and which is his favourite!

I need a miniSEG, stack of trillion dollars and a meteorite in my life
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:58:18
keep an eye out, I think they are about to go live!

Hello Jarred,
We are trying to set an example and hope that other businesses embrace the blockchain.
If you can help us with hashing data, trades and inventory that would be great! We want complete transparency in true bitcoin fashion. It is something we get very excited about!
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:56:56
Im certain it is operated by the same team. I think they are doing the email notifications now and prepping the site.
 
@_date: 2015-11-27 07:15:43
Shows how much I know. Thanks for the correction !
@_date: 2015-11-27 07:21:05
I agree,
We could not find a way to include an extra discount for Bitcoin only payments without advertising a "code" that would be pilfered by Fiat customers.
What we did instead is focus on advertising to the Bitcoin community so everyone is aware of the sales and can take advantage.
We are going to submit a support ticket and ask for currency specific discounts. That should get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:20:26
We work around the clock and put everything in to it. Our Beef Jerky is an amazing product and the market is in high demand for premium Beef.
We have spent more than we make setting things up but we have big plans for 2016! 
@_date: 2015-11-27 07:22:39
Jump on the .info and submit one there too? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 07:10:30
Thats about $13 USD for you guys and our small packets from $3 USD. Not bad huh? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 08:04:04
Some processors might convert to fiat instantly but we are holding on to our coins =)
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:53:35
We received an email from the site administrators and can expect deals to go up in an hour or two! (2 hours ago)

I am planning a big summer launch for the Lime and Cracked Pepper. Approximately 4-6 weeks. We will be doing some cool stuff online so keep an eye on our fb page
