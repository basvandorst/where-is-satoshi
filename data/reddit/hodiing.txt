I run a large Facebook group for Bitcoin and cryptos. We don't pump coins but rather we help people and give them guidance on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. We never give investment advice, except these two brothers who love bcash. They are both bcash schills and all they try to do is post bcash shit and bash Bitcoin. It's rather annoying and at first I was compelled to respond to their bullshit rhetoric. I honestly don't know what to do. I started the group to help friends and family but it's grown into something bigger. It's taken so much energy and time to combat these two brothers but I'm tired and I just don't think I can do it anymore. I don't want to censor people in a public group. One brother always starts his sentences with  _"The vision of the original white paper written by Satoshi..."_ and I can see why it would be hard for an uninformed noobie to not be fooled by this bs. So what do I do, if anything?

People see value in transferring wealth via the Bitcoin network because it is the most decentralized, peer-to-peer, immutable network that exists. 
Lightening Network. 
It's funny everybody likes to bash Bitcoin about the fees and Confirmation times. But when I went over and played crypto kitties I had almost a hundred transactions fail on the ethereum network and the fees were exuberant at times. Besides ethereum there is no other project out there that has gone through the same stress test as Bitcoin in any regard. Therefore there is no other project out there that can claim faster or cheaper transactions then Bitcoin until that project undergos the same stress test.
How long will it last? There's no finite amount of time, it will work or it won't. It's that simple. Just because I can't buy a cup of coffee with my Bitcoin right now doesn't make it a failure. People claim these other projects will save me from paying massive fees and waiting for long confirmations, but there is no project out there that can do or will do what Bitcoin does so I'll continue to pay those fees and wait for those confirmations. And so will thousands of other people, as proof, the amount of wealth being transferred on the Bitcoin Network.

@_date: 2018-01-09 16:39:33
Initially it was centered around Bitcoin so I could help family and friends but as it grew altcoin discussion found it's way into the mix. I consider myself a Bitcoin maximilist but I don't think the folks I'm helping understand that concept. So I attempt to help them in any way I can with the intentions of steering them towards Bitcoin.
I like your idea of drawing the line on imposter coins and bcash would certainly fall under that category. I'll keep that in mind if things persist. They are somewhat reluctant in posting often but when they do it's easy to get a sense of what their intentions are. I'm happy to say though that most of their post do not get much attention if any at all.
Thank you for the advice and also thank you for everything you do for this community I really appreciate it.

I'm not saying someone didn't order those hits. I'm saying Ross didn't, and the district attorney seems to agree. Innocent until proven guilty is not just a legal matter, it is very much societal as well. Especially when the jury ultimately deciding your fate is fed lies about how you are a murderer.

I only do it for friends and family who are willing to also invest. I've found that when someone also puts in their own money they take it more seriously. So my offer was (no longer offering) whatever you invest I'll match. This got my mom, 1 nephew, brother, aunt and a few friends to invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:39
No... that is the beauty of innocent until proven guilty. The convicting party has the burden of proof. Jeez its basic legal shit. If you want to make the claim he murdered someone the burden is on you to prove that. It is not the other way around. Until then it's a smear campaign. Those chat logs are obviously not proof as there were no charges or convictions for murder or anything related to violence. 
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:47:04
Yeah and I'm sure both sides use the same tactics. Yet you'll sit here and corner it to make it look like one side does it. You want to get into politics let's get into politics. This is a Bitcoin subreddit, just remember that you brought the politics into it.

Looks like earn.com used an idea straight from Satoshi's playbook. 
_It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."_
Kinda cool I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:18
You have no reason to think those logs are him, except your own personal emotions. You just want to believe he is guilty/violent, nothing else.

Actually he prohibited the sale of fraud and stolen goods, including personal information and credit cards. Ross said it best,

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:16
Charges were brought against him you clearly dont have a basic understanding of criminal law. 
Let's begin with “charge.” When a person is charged with a crime, a formal allegation (a statement not yet proven) of an offense is made. Once convicted, the person has been proven or declared guilty of the offense. In the United States, a person is convicted after a legal trial.

Yup, local Jr. College graduate spotted. There are no dead bodies, if there are no bodies im going to assume no hits happened. Did someone order the hits? Maybe, or maybe it's a complete fabrication made up by LE to smear someone and get a guilty conviction. Clearly the legal experts we call District Attorneys don't believe they have a case, because the burden is on them to prove it and no charges ever brought forward and who would pass on a conviction like this? None. Maybe it's miscommunication or your lack of basic understanding regarding the legal system, either way you don't understand what I'm saying, clearly.

Should have known you are a person who attacks the person. Following your logic everybody would just tell and scream and call each retards. 
Pure fucking attack mode. Go read some debates, there is no fucking way you are an adult that has any experience with logical fallacies or debate tactics, because all you have are personal attacks. 
Any rational person comes to a conclusion based on the evidence, yet You have provided none. They don't just pick and choose evidence to believe and not to believe.

Becayse the DA's not gonna pass on a high profile headline grabbing trial of this caliber.

_sell when you are a millionair_ 
Not a Big fan of this statement. Price of bitcoin in fiat is irrelevant, it's about purchasing power. Why is millions the key here? Why sell at millionaire? Why is an inflated, centralized, mutable fiat currency better than just holding my bitcoin? It's not. It never will be.

I'm the uncle getting my nephews into bitcoin. My first nephew I gave him 1 bitcoin 2 years ago because he was willing to also buy one, so I matched him. He's been hodling since and has accumulated more on his own. Second nephew I told him I'd give him one bitcoin if he could finish 3 months working a crazy hard laborious job. He did it and I gave him one. 
1st nephew is off and running on his own, 2nd nephew I've retained custody of his hodlings until he learns to manage it himself. The other nephews are too young but I've got my sights set on funding their college or other life improving choices. I love my nieces but my nephews are the shit.

1) nobody knows what the price will be, ever. Just because a group of 20 guys have expectations, we should expect those expectations to come about? No. People's expectations don't mean shit, including yours. 
2) where are these people expecting the bitcoin price to correct soon? Please show me the you tube videos of these professionals and what they _expect_
I expect bitcoin to go up to 10k before a correction. I've seen people here make the same expectations. Ive even seen some YouTube videos about it. So it must be true! It is written! Bitcoin to 10k then correction...because well, those are my expectations and clearly herd mentality will work in my favor.

I started on aol. If not for aol I wouldn't have been online. Obviously using this centralized service I was unable to experience all the benefits of the internet at the time but I was happy to be on. I had no idea a much larger internet existed besides the aol one I'd been using. Once I realized aol was just a fraction of all this craze I graduated and learned how to internet without aol holding my hand anymore. But those times I spent on aol are a big reason I learned computers and without that stepping stone I'm not sure I'd have had the opportunity to learn.

_(iii) A natural person who engages in an activity identified in paragraphs (ff)(1) through (ff)(5) of this section on an infrequent basis and not for gain or profit._
The key here is _not for gain or profit_. So when you add a 10% markup to the spot price from major exchanges when selling bitcoin, that's a profit. I think someone who just sells some bitcoin once in a while (usually at a 10% loss when selling on LBC to regular buyers) would fall under the limitation I posted above.
The 3000$ limit I think people are confused about that. I'm not 100% sure but I think the only requirement there is, if you sell &gt;3k$ worth you are required to obtain information about the buyer, even if you are not considered to be an MSB. 
From what I've seen (so far), the only people law enforcement is targeting are people who frequently buy/sell bitcoin with a markup/markdown on prices obtained from major exchanges. 
I'm not an attorney and this is not legal advice. I may even be incorrect, if so would appreciate clarification if anybody has some. Good luck out there, guess this is more reason to continue hodling.

Bitpay will make you fill out kyc info in an attempt to find out who owns how much Bitcoin. Let's say you want to pay a merchant .01 Bitcoin from an input of 1 Bitcoin. Well the entire input is sent, the .01 to the merchant, and the remaining change to a change address. 
Before you sent the tx of .01, bitpay forced you to provide your identity. Now bitpay knows who you are, and they know exactly how much Bitcoin you hold in that change address. You think bitpay will pass on compiling this information? You best believe you are put onto a list which can be easily shared with prying eyes. 
This is about tracking how much Bitcoin each person owns. Every centralized exchange and payment processor is being forced to collect information on Bitcoin users. I'll leave it up to you to come up with an answer to the question "_why?_"
