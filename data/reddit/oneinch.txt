Ah yes, civil forfeiture. You have to prove your innocence and the court doesn't have to provide you an attourney. That being said, the poor of America fall victim to this because they cannot afford to defend themselves.

The only thing keeping me from switching to Dish is their internet. If they would offer unlmited in my area they would find themselvs with a new customer.

I don't know, I had a [6263]( and that thing was a beast. Dropped so much it wasn't even funny. I even threw that damn thing against thing, more than once, before I finally killed it. Actually, I think it still worked just the display on the inside wouldn't work. Im confident you could run that thing over with a semi and it would keep working. Then I got a [5230 Nuron]( and that ho also got tossed around. I broke the screen and the case, replaced the screen and just taped up the case, bitch still kept working. Then I had a [700]( ... you know what? I actually treated that one nice. Then I went to a 521 and that didn't last long. And now the 635 is... well... still new and the damn back battery cover doesn't want to stay on and it runs like shit.

I think what is being missed here is that malware writers, have for a time now, been sneaking in bitcoin miners into things using your machine to mine bitcoins for them. AVG probably just blanket banned all miners without giving much thought to the consequences.
