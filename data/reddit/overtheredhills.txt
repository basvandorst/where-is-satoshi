if you think SHA 256 can not be broken with quantum computing then it's me who feels sorry for you
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:56:18
there's no easy way to short it. and yes fuck gambling..

"You clearly have no idea of what Bitcoin is" is what you guys say all the time. I do know what bitcoin is , and this is why I was able to write these 23 reasons why it is dellusional
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:21:59
you're really dreaming here man. government have no incentive at all to be bitcoin friendly , it's here to destroy theur sovereign currency and their authority
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:36:53
you guys are not credible u have the whole world against you including bill gates and you think you know better than everybody else. you've been brainwashed. being anti governement and fiat doesn't have to mean pro-crypto !!
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:29:39
yes market is irrational. They often are. But when will the bubble pop? Even I don't know
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:22:10
which claim is wrong ?
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:03:42
so bch is worthless but BTC is worth something ? you guys are dellusional.. this is a giant casino 
The fact you can know these 24 points and still be in crypto proves you guys are insane. you've been brainwashed it's like you're in love and don't wanna see the ugly side. You guys are crypto fanatics
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:08:45
do you even realize what you're saying ? Bitcoin is the mother of all bubbles and you guys are convinced it's better than actual money. 
But it's not your fault , you've been brainwashed. But someday the bubble has to pop.. who knows when it will happen
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:06:52
do some research on the tulip bubble and you will realize that bitcoin is even worse. at least the tulip were something real. when this thing crashes you will realize that you spend thousands of dollars to buy something that does not exist.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:27:15
you guys are buying something that doesn't exist. it's all vaporware. At least the tulip bulb bubble had something not worth zero.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:15:17
in the meantime you have failed to prove me wrong on  a single claim. maybe you're the retarded one cause you're into crypto ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:22:23
yes !
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:25:53
if the difficulty decreases , any organization will be able to 51% attack BTC !!!!!!!

@_date: 2019-05-04 19:19:20
your comment suggest you're a fool , trying to decredibilize me as a person instead of attacking my claim , which should be very worrying for you holders out there.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:18:43


i looked at CME , bitmex , kucoin , kraken : none of these are worth doing
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:18:00
it's always the same answer from you fanatics. You throw around "I know better , go do some research" But you know what? I did ! and this how i came up with this list of 29 reasons why it's worthless
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:25:33
your comment confirms my worries , most of you are fools thinking they know better than everyone and that will end up broke but don't know it yet. Most of you don't have anything as a counter argument , only insults
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:53:00
my last holding was BCH and it more than doubled since I bought so you are incorrect. and that's not what matters if that's your only counter argument I feel sorry for you. You're gonna get rekt if u keep investing in this insanity
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:55:53
only BTC , bitcoin and bitcoin cash cause they're the major ones affected with this but ure right  ZEC , BSV are affected as well hm.. and all crypto are related to btc anyway
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:04:56
"real estate, or shares in a company" are REAL. bitcoin is not real.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:08:26
this claim is actually supported by more brilliant persons than you and me. Bitcoin is not sustainable.. 
right Or maybe you should find another hobby than virtual collectibles
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:18:05
I understand the bolivar lost most of its value , but don't think Bitcoin is safe. I'm sorry for the venezualian situation , just be careful with cryptos , it's bad too
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:17:45
if BTC HAS to increase in price in order for the security of the network to remain *relatively* secure , then it's purely not sustainable , like a Ponzi.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:05:44
man , bitcoin is not scarce. It's been forked countless times , and having a hard cap is not sustainable , they will probably change the code so that there is a permanant inflation like on monero , dogecoin , stellar etc
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:15:54
THis quote is from the wolf of wall street trailer. Funny fact Jordan Belfort himself claims bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:18:09
aggressiveness is a normal reaction for a crypto fanatic like you who refuses to see both sides of the arguments. you guys are not rational. delusional too
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:17:34
yes I did. and here are my conclusions : 
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:52:47
come on , every claim is real , I didn't invent anything. Haven't you heard about parity wallet , XLM 2.5B inflation bug , and the rest ? Even I know more about crypto than you do it seems.
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:36:53
at least they're more real lol. When you buy a house , it might be inflated but still it"s worth something for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:33:25
 Coindesk : “The Latest Bitcoin Bug Was So Bad, Developers Kept Its Full Details a Secret”an attacker could have actually used it to create new Bitcoin — above the 21 million hard-cap of coin creation — thereby inflating the supply and devaluing current bitcoins.”
this is only 1/25 reasons
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:48:58
I'm not saying fiat is perfect , I'm saying cryptos are 100 times worse
