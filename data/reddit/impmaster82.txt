The bubble ain't popping until all the coins are mined, and that's still in a few months

So do you guys think the futures coming out on Monday are going to crash the price (because Wall Streets pump and dump), or they'll make the price go insane (because hype), or nothing (cause it's a small company)

Well sure but if you’re just trading back and forth, you’ve gotta make sure to make enough money that you don’t lose profit on fees

I mean, it all depends on how you want to live the rest of your life. You could probably live decently by just selling all that, buying a house in a red state in the US and relaxing for the rest of your life. 
At some point, all the bitcoins will be mined. We're at 80% right now. That's when I think the bubble will burst, and the true value of bitcoin will show. 
I'd say sell before it crashes, just difficult to tell when that is going to be.

Red states have lower cost of living because the governors have lower taxes and laxer regulations, plus they're more rural states than, say, California or New York.
There's huge amounts of poverty in California because the cost of living is so high because everyone wants to live there. If you go to Kansas or something, you can buy a house dirt cheap, but you have to live in Kansas.
