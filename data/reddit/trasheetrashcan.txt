Well, there is a way how to determine: Compare things which are comparable, meaning fork against fork (*not* BCH vs BTC) - two most recent forks off the BTC chain - BCH vs BTG.
Thus finally, when comparing behavior of communities and interest groups behind BCH and BTG, then BCH comes out as crappy one ...

I wish I would be smoking so I could do the same ...

I'm really curious how many forced margin positions have had been tripped by the slide already, and how much of it is still waiting to go soon ...

I think it is worth to put this in to the right perspective by comparing against comparable:
Compare "Bitcoin Cache" vs "Bitcoin Gold".
Both are hard forks of Bitcoin block chain, and as far as context of this discussion is concerned, the only difference is the behavior of communities behind each fork - there is no other way how to put this, unfortunately, but no mater what, bcache backers are clearly shitty ones here ...

Actually, if BTC would hold as strong as Jamie's breasts, we are safe, f..king safe ...
Just a few teasers to illustrate:
* [to start off with](
* [yet another nice one](
* [proof of concept 
* [proof of concept  / still holding strong](
BTW, the BTC is sitting on big slide right now, it is telling, isn it?

I suspect the reason for such behavior is that quite a few of them bought the BCH with something what actually has real value, like fiat or BTC, and now they do not have another option than to keep howl with wolf pack, since it is too late to pull off ...

As already pointed by others, it would be necessary to identify how many Bitcoins mined per day are actually sold per that(almost) day.
This is actually possible to estimate - from blockchain. It is quite trivial to identify bitcoins mined per last 24 hours (addresses where these bitcoins appeared).
Then we can identify how many of mined bitcoins have changed address in last 24 hours.
As the first approximation, we can assume change of address means sell (e.g. move to btc stock exchange address). Obviously, this is not the best measure, since the first move could mean move to cold wallet.
I believe that with a little bit more playing with statistics one could sniff out patterns, e.g. typical transactions miner wallet address -&gt; cold wallet address + miner wallet address -&gt; some other wallet address (for example assuming exchange). Statistical  evaluation could be based on amounts shifted around, times, etc. ..., you would not believe what can be sniffed out of blockchain if one really wants to dig to the ground ...

bump, no one? really?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:06
that BCH bump is temporary and manufactured scam. The team of programmers behind it is joke when compared to Bitcoin Core - and this is the most critical attribute of the thing. Bitcoin Core is already on 0.15.1, look at the BCH - it is way behind running old 0.14.x and it will degrade even more as the time will go on ...
This temporary sell-off is caused by machinations and freaked out traders ...

CME futures approval is waiting in the line, I would not bet that BTC will go much cheaper than it is right now ...

Well spotted, thanks for pointing that out.

"Only" 12! (= 479 001 600) permuations of 12 words to try :)
Complete BRUTE FORCE (If you do **NOT** have any other information about the wallet except mnemonic words):
1. Per **each** permutation, you would need to do all following in sequence:
2. generate the wallet (= deterministic hierarchical wallet)
3. per each token (BTC, ETH, Ripple, etc) do following
4. per each token you would need to generate "a few" key pairs (I would do at least 50 of them)
5. then check balances on main net per each generated public key (address)
You can significantly cut down the time (by orders of magnitude) **IF** you have additional information about wallet, for example following info would help:
* you know order (and/or position) for some words in the mnemonic (the more the better, obviously), this helps with 1) above
* you know what kind of tokens you kept in the wallet (e.g. you know that you had BTC in there), this helps with 3) above
* you know addresses / public keys you received on (or sent from) tokens. If you don't know this, but for some reason you know transactions (Tx hashes) you can get addresses from transactions. This helps with 5) above, so you would not need to check balances on mainnet what is expensive (in time domain = slow), but you can straight compare these known pub.key(s)/addresse(s) against **generated** pub key(s) / addresse(s) to identify if you found your wallet (= the right ordering of mnemonic words)

You hit the nail! Quite a few people see bitcoin the same way right now ...
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:13:10
This is exactly the same in what we consider now as "normal" trading markets.  
What about "whales" who control huge amounts of company shares - e.g. founders of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. ...?  
There are situations where single person controls &gt;50% of shares.  
So in this regards, Bitcoin, or any other "coins", are not anything special.
