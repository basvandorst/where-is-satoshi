In his example where 1 character is changed, it would be computationally impractical to find a vanity address matching even a third of an address.
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:06:32
It doesn't work that way. Typically a user would share their onename handle after registering it. Someone who hacks your Twitter account has no access to your Bitcoin private keys
@_date: 2014-08-07 06:10:14
You could inspect the code and you would see that the keys are never sent out from RushWallet. Also because the seed for the private key is stored in the URL after the " tag, it is not transmitted from your computer when you load the page

"As a medium of exchange bitcoin initially seems no better or worse than fiat currencies, since anything portable (like paper or an electronic data file) can be used as that medium so long as enough agents agree to use it. Therein lies bitcoin's limitation: with due apology to anarchists, there is no common power like a government to compel the public to use bitcoin as universally as its own fiat currency. Recall that currencies don’t become widely used spontaneously or through a grass-roots campaign. They become widely used nationally because a government declares them legal tender"

If you choose to set a password on your wallet it will encrypt your private key and you will be required to enter your password every time you want to send a transaction. Google Chrome extensions are much safer than web wallets because Chrome sandboxes every extension so there is not way for a malicious web page to access the extension in any way.

There is currently a limit to how many transactions can be mined in a block. That means that the amount of transactions mined every hour on average is maxed out. So any further adoption will in fact cause people to see more delays in their transactions until Bitcoin becomes unusable except for the largest transactions due to the high fee that will be required to prioritize your transactions to actually get them in a block.

seems like way too much money for a software startup. most innovative companies start with just one or two engineers who build out all the infrastructure for free. my guess is that they will throw a ton of money into hiring many developers with differing visions and most, if not all the money will be wasted on that and marketing/hiring other employees. The magic is in the actual software and UI/UX. It's hard to get all that down with a large core team

Hey, the transaction fee part doesn't make sense. You wrote that miners set the transaction fees that get added to the block. Rather it is the users who define the transaction fees for each transaction, not the block. Miners have the ability to choose the minimum fee for transactions they will put into a block.

The confirmations are in place to protect Bitcoin users. They aren't a necessity when you send to trusted parties. 10 minutes to confirm a transaction is nothing in comparison to how long it takes a credit card company to truly confirm a transaction. And with credit cards you risk chargebacks. Confirmations are the only way this system can possibly be decentralized. Decentralized currencies cannot work any other way!

the current price is the price of the last trade. if you look at the buy and sell order book for an exchange you will see buy bids for lower than the last price and on the sell side for higher than the current price. the current price is the last price at which a buy and sell order met
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:08:14
Bitcoin is pretty damn perfect. The problem is there's a very small market cap right now and anyone can shift the market price with small buys/sells. Traders who use Mt. Gox have pulled their orders around the market price creating a huge spread making even more panic from the volatility. Really what is happening are small volume buys/sells somehow taking place even with all the crazy "lag" at Gox and the number you see and trust to be the "current price" of Bitcoin is a completely useless number. Just wait till this shit stabilizes. It will be a roller coaster for a while, but it's the only way it can be right now.

Do you mean using the Pebble to sign transactions? You'd only really be able to sign tx's from your phone that is connected to your pebble only. I don't know if it would be much safer than just using your phone.

Unless you are okay with waiting a long time to get Armory running, I suggest using a lightweight Bitcoin client like Electrum ( that allows you to get up and running very quickly since all the block data is stored on electrum servers while your own keys to sign transactions are still safe on your machine. You can also create an offline wallet using electrum fairly easily.

It isn't about the hashrate of the miners. It's about the average person running the Bitcoin client on their computer as it downloads/verifies/transmits every single Bitcoin transaction in the world. The spammy transactions can take up just as much space in the blockchain as larger value non-spammy transactions. 
Eventually most users wont be runing the client software and rather connecting to verified public nodes running on advanced hardware.
Getting rid of the "dust" transactions will also allow us to get rid of the minimum TX fee.

ripple is regulatable, therefore it will eventually be completely controlled/shutdown by the government if it ever gained traction. the beauty of bitcoin is that can NEVER happen. and ripple even has a Ton of "ripples" already premined. they own the entire currency. why go backward?
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:34:31
Outputs have to do with the way transactions work. When you send bitcoins from one address to another, the software uses the previous received transactions "outputs" as "inputs" for new transactions. 
At the current value of around $117 per BTC (0.00005430 x 117) = 0.0063531
So if this change were fully implemented now, only transactions worth less than .0064 cents would be considered "dust" (spam)

That's wrong. The only keys exchanged with PGP are the public keys which in no way help to decrypt the message. You need the private key for that. The private key is never transfered to anyone

it's just data packets. they can be routed in any way, through any port, using numerous types of encryption and tunneling methods. they can never really stop Bitcoin traffic even if they really wanted to..unless of course they somehow manage to destroy every network. The Blockchain would still remain intact as long as a few people kept their copy of the blockchain. Long live Bitcoin!

From 
"The fragment identifier functions differently than the rest of the URI: namely, its processing is exclusively client-side with no participation from the web server — of course the server typically helps to determine the MIME type, and the MIME type determines the processing of fragments. When an agent (such as a Web browser) requests a web resource from a Web server, the agent sends the URI to the server, but does not send the fragment. Instead, the agent waits for the server to send the resource, and then the agent processes the resource according to the document type and fragment value."

Using Elliptic Curve cryptography, a seed can be generated that only generates the public keys and not the corresponding private keys. This "public" seed can be used to generate an unlimited amount of public addresses in the watch-only wallet.

Because the Bitcoin isn't really made to do transactions that small. It can...but right now as most of the Bitcoin clients run on consumer hardware, it makes sense to keep the blockchain size as low as possible.
