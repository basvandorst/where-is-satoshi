The thought that capitalism only works if the welfare of the people are at the highest priority of corporations is actually an original thought of the first modern capitalist Adam Smith. 
I mean look at Sweden, they have unions dictating so much and I don’t believe their companies fail as often, so it’s really in both’s interest long term. 
Unionizing is the answer in my opinion.

You gotta be careful there’s people pushing the agenda it’s going to fail, just so they can acquire more bitcoins first. 
If you can get a grand or two and your electricity costs are .10 kW or lower then you could profit from mining bitcoin too. Still hodl
Pretty much anybody who’s worth listening to on the matter is that convinced, there’s still people who try to apply fiat currency economics to this and that doesn’t work exactly lol
Good luck man!! The world needs bright individuals like yourself. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:39:20
Yes lol
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:46:37
You’re a smart one. Remember,
Till you’re fucking retired. 
Even when it hits 50-200k
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:37:47
Do you yet??? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:34:57
More or less the latter yeah, I already pay taxes and do my duties I feel as tho. But dang they got this on a tight squeeze �� lol okay well no harm in counting this as a gift and then starting a business from it and investing THAT money �� I’ll just have to rethink this part when I get there ��
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:02:48
Right, I was just thinking about it today. Do I ever live above my means or do I just put hodl in my will?

You’ve raised a good kid sir/madam lmao

And they were the only group allowed to practice usury, a group of banker buddies then used the Knight Templar as a template to start charging interest to Kong’s and queens. 
And the start of reserve banking was initiated.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:19:36
Lmfao stoppppppp
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:58:56
Exactly, and this revitalization of morals in capitalist thinking is what’s going to restore this bleak bleak world.
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:04:59
Bankers then used the Templar’s model on Kong’s and queens, it as allowed even tho usury was outlawed because they were dealing with Kings and queens, and viola, fractional reserve banking started. 
The real enemy is interest rates.

Everyone’s pretty much in agreeance that bitcoin is going to overtake fiat currency. 
So yeah bitcoin is the new dollar bill. It’ll be around for our grandkids kids most likely, if not as the main medium of exchange, then at least an asset to such. So I’d hold it for literally ever. 
Don’t be like the millions of people in 2008-2013 who had millions of bitcoins and thought it wouldn’t go up to $300 lol
Edit: Even when it hits 200,000 and goes back to 130,000 for corrections, HODL! Lol 
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:16:08
I’d honestly laugh like a fucking maniac lmao
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:25:25
What’s the lightning network? I keep hearing about it and I googled it but I still don’t know. It’s just free and fast? What’s the technology behind it?
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:15:24
They’re essentially the same thing if you think about it. 
First pic should be 
“Spending $0.01 at the store” vs

Thank you! I’m realizing more and more decentralization is the people’s revolution!
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:18:49
Bahaha mucho apreciado! That’s awesome I had no idea you could even do short term trading with bitcoin in a Roth IRA. That’s so crazy! Especially since it’s so volatile it’s like why wouldn’t you? 
Lol what Roth IRA company are you invested in? Or do all of them trade bitcoin? 
Thanks again!
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:42:24
Shoulda hedl
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:42:52
What constitutes a large transaction? 
So there’s not really a need for a better service than LN? 
I’d not currently, ever?
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:19:54
I’d love for you to expand this. I don’t feel like the premise is the same for the reciprocal but I’d be inclined to not think otherwise if sufficient reason was provided!
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:29:03
What don’t be so paranoid lol
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:09:25
Lol so in layman’s terms? 
I can buy and sell bitcoin within my Roth IRA to increase its investments?
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:21:55
What services are used to transport bitcoin? Like what is the actual method of wiring? Not what company, but what/how do the companies transfer the bitcoin? What’s the technology called?
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:45:31
Which fund do you play? I only just started using fidelity and the mobile app. I see funds like BITCF and BITCX ��
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:29:37
Oh shit, can you explain more?
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:23:22
I wouldn’t even say most economist, it depends on what their philosophies and motives are. 
Literally just the study of economy. Neutral
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:26:48
Awesome thanks fam I’ll check it out!
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:28:46
Why? What’s kyc???
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:27:43
Nice! Thanks! :) would you be willing to expand on that? I’m new to the blockchain game but this is all fascinating! 
Additional second or third layer systems? Would they just differ in speed, size, and security mostly? 
And then the tech behind that, is it just special coding?
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:38:39
The Lord’s work. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:29:46
Nice extremely valuable information here thank you! And I completely agree too, if that’s the case then we need something for that final solution like you say. 
What are IOT devices?? 
Do you think LN will scale or come out with a more all encompassing transfer service? Or is it probably more likely a newer startup would come and take the lead?
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:38:44
Dang! Would you assume most smaller banks would have done the same besides like chase and stuff??
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:02:04
All of my liquid is tied up in other funds unfortunately or I would.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:49:07
I live in an area where electricity is already extremely cheap and the company who provides the electricity put us on a capped plan so we only pay a deductible per se. up to a specific amount and they cover the rest.
@_date: 2019-09-15 14:21:02
The “eau” messes me up so much! Beaucoup and bureau are my big ones lmao

Lol I had a family reunion in 2013, im known as the smart one in the family but I’m also the youngest and no one takes me seriously out of like 30 people. 
Told everyone to put half their investments in bitcoin 2013. Bitcoin was $360 for 1. 
Fast forward to now, bitcoins 11,0000. 
Like they all chalked it up like it was crazy. The other intellect that is respected dismissed it. I wanted to say I told you so so bad lmao 
Anyways, I’m following my own advice
