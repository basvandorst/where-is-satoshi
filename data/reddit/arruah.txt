@_date: 2015-06-30 04:22:00
I created the loan five times on the site btcjam.com it five times removed administration without any reason. For support requests not answered.
The fifth time the answer came.
I'm trying to buy a Bitcoin ATM to be installed in the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan.
They removed my loan because they feel that this needs to be done. I also noticed that before these events, my rating was B now became C.
I want to warn other users to work with this website.
Sorry for my English.

I can't edit this image.
They answered me:
Kanat, good afternoon
In Alma-Ata not need Bitcoin-ATM, because Bitcoins can be purchased at any store cash register or payment terminal.
I'll be glad to discuss with you other ways to popularize Bitcoins in Kazakhstan.
Have a nice day and thank you that you are a part of the community BTCjam.

Yesterday enjoy playing Germans and Argentines I found that the system is exposed as my bet winnings bet on Argentina.
Contacting customer support I received a reply.
Dear kanat,
Our betting system is designed in such a way that you make a confirmation before your bet is placed into the system in cases of flat bets. When live, you have to update before placing your bets so as to make sure of your bets. Therefore since it is not possible to prove your case, i regret to tell you that Anonibet cannot do anything in regards to this situation.
John(Anonibet Support Team)
I am not fond of Igor rates and sweepstakes. It was the first in my life bet, just for fun.
But I am 100% sure that I put a bet on Germany winnings.
So either they are crooks, or their system has glitches, or I'm out of your mind.
I just want to warn you :)

Kazakhstan depends on the decisions of the Russian Federation in almost all sectors of the economy. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia united in a Customs Union. I'm pretty sure that Kazakhstan will ban Bitcoin as well as the Russian Federation banned. But there are smart people in our government. Though not as many as we would like.

Who is insured by the fact that any of the major exchanges will not repeat the situation that happened to Mtgox? We need transparency, we need to know how many Bitcoins have hot and cold wallet in exchange. Exchange must prove it periodically sending a small amount to the wikileaks for example. It would be ideal if the exchange, or other companies working with Bitcoin checked to rating agencies.
If you like this idea then retweet please.

According to him, the technology issue " guileless " but to launch corresponding project need to check whether it will be attractive to customers.
Gref said that for such global virtual currencies like Bitcoins , you need global regulation . "Peace can not be stopped , he went in this direction" , - the president of the Savings Bank . He suggested that the global regulation can be developed after one or two failures , or other Bitcoin virtual currency .
Sberbank bought " Yandex " at the end of December last year . Over three-quarters of Russia's largest payment system Bank gave $ 60 million.
In April this year, Google conducted a study and found out that the Russians were the first place in the number of requests on the Internet related to Bitcoin . The three were also Estonia and the United States .
Interest in Bitcoins grew significantly in the second half of this year after the financial power of the world 's largest economy - the U.S. - have made the use of virtual currencies on a legal basis . Now Bitcoins are not regulated or controlled by any country . Some states , such as China , are taking measures to restrict the flow of kriptovalyuty . In particular , the People's Bank of China has banned finorganizatsii country from engaging in transactions with Bitcoin .
