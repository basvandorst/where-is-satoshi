You're still out a phone for as long as shipping and junk takes. And with FedEx carriers taking off with packages or dropping routes mid-delivery...

Sort of? If you have a downloaded app and saved it to your computer, as long as nothing fundamental in iOS changes, you are good. But things DO change, which is why some older removed apps no longer work. I actually think in some cases as per the T&amp;S you are able to re-download "removed" apps depending on the reasons for removal. I think I can still grab VLC from the app store in previous purchases, despite it no longer being available, if that all makes sense.

Eehhhhhh. After using both I really do prefer Alien Blue. If it had an Android port I'd be thrilled. Bacon Reader feels like some JavaScript rewrite of the site, heh.

The older the better sometimes if being recycled for scrap. Some very niche places around town here will take phones newer than 3 or so years that are working somewhat and combine parts from the same models to make working ones too, which get donated, it's cool shit.

To be fair the difference between high end android and low end android devices is about the same between a Core i7 and a Pentium /// computer.

Perhaps so the customer won't be inclined to buy apps on iOS which net Apple money regardless? Not sure.

It depends on what you use it for I'd imagine. For me the decision was between a low-end phone, a mobile internet SIM, and a laptop. Or a top of the line smartphone. I can connect my phone to any VGA or HDMI display and use a keyboard, so it was a smarter investment at the time. When it comes time to replace it, I then have a small portable webserver in essence should I decide to keep it on.

I'm sad because he could have sold the phone and bought himself a nexus 5 and then there would be a phone for someone else to have, instead he made garbage.

Hey man, I own a half decent Casio watch and the upkeep is a hell of a lot less than a Rolex I had!

The 5c replaced the 5s in the lineup because it was cheaper to make, they could retool for new components, and sell at the same price ( better components, cheaper case, you get the drift )

Besides, Alien Blue.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:21:46
They can always jailbreak, even on the 5s I thought there was a tethered version.

Elaborate? I'm not sure they have enough market share to really be considered a threat legally anymore.

Alas, I do require the truly mobile internet. That and to be fair with the new LTE rollout in my city, it's faster than my Time Warner shitternet that I pay $36/mo for.

My thoughts exactly, an Arm9 and the GPU could be coded to mine better than some net books people are using. Would be a better cause.

Hell, if it's a good enough 5S he can get TWO Nexus 5 devices! Not... not sure what he'd do with two. But... a backup?
