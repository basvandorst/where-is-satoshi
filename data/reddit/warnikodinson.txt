Isn't that what namecoin tried to do for web servers?
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:18:50


No. The American government keeps funding them.

According to this, 2011.

Honey is expensive.

Not if it's written right.

As the coin gets more valuable and more transactions take place, each fee can be less as there are more of them.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:44
You will still be able to mine, just instead of getting new coins, the miners will be getting transaction fees tied to each block.

I thought the chain and broadcast where of minimal resource usage though? 
Edit: Are those numbers for full nodes? If so, that makes the chain on a full nodes at least 250GB?
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:36:57
Just one question, why will increasing block size decrease the amount of nodes in the network?

I get about .5 BTC a day with them. I'm making money while saving money on electricity.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:48:50
I have no gas out where I live, and electricity is 7 cents per kWh, but yeah I guess mining at no cost is actually what's happening. I do have a pellet stove that I use when I can get fuel for it cheap. (I can use wood, corn or wheat.)
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:07:22
I use it when ever I need to trade, the price is never that far off the norm that is quoted, and it sends me my money within 24 hours. What sort of mess is it in?

[I'm sorry, did you just say someone can't do something in America?](

What about CampBX?

username is futurebound has is OS skinned to look like Windows 95/2000.
Not even an XP skin?
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:49:54
Huh, I just started using it a month ago, I've only used ACH and the whole thing works fine for me all the time. I've had no support issues yet, so I can't comment on that.

Electric registers, which after looking them up are called baseboard heaters as well.
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:02:13
Do it, less mining power on the network for my miners to go against! Mwahahahaha!
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:45:57
I just got my two 60GH/s singles today, already up and making me BitCoin.
Why are so many of you down on BFL? It's an experimental product that before them no one had built before, there would always be delays. I pre-ordered a year ago and payed through pay-pal, never once thought about refunding.

Man In The Middle middle attack.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:41:24
Yeah, I've only sold.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:51:06
I live in the snow belt close to lake Erie so the temp is a tad bit more stable but yeah, when it goes above 72 the GPUs go off.
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:09:42
I'm renting the house, so the only options are my miners, registers, or wood pellet stove. A heat pump would be nice though.
