aslong as it this complicated to use LN it will never be mainstream , just saying. it needs to be usable by the average monkey
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:09:02
takes some IQ to get it
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:03:19
2008 was not a financial collapse
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:58:41
trust me, if everything is made private and people wont have to pay taxes for the useless politicians, they will find new ways of having things, as internet etc 
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:18:23
everything? if world finance collapse so will be the internet and modern humans
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:56:09
thats what "they" want you to think. it will never hit 20k again. its being heavily surpressed by the very ELITES themselves.
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:41:00
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:16:54
i buy the US continent for 1 bitcoin and build a wall around it to the moon
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:00:26
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:48:46
yes, everything private, pay for what you need easy
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:25:16
you are clueless
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:00:54
looooool how you gonna pay someone with bitcoin with no internet
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:34:29
i had one , then the alts took 90%
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:19:29
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:25:40
tax is the modern slavery. no idea why the human population just accept it.
@_date: 2018-09-25 06:13:32
since when. bitcoins main usecase is to accumulate FIAT. PONZI
@_date: 2018-09-25 06:40:41
you are still in denial my friend.
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:53:41
bitcoin will never be adopted unless the world knows who Satoshi is.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:34:08
bitcoin is ded
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:05:44
this. i asked recently at my work job in Germany if they know what bitcoin is, not one knows
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:16:24
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:32:56
he is damping on us as we speak
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:17:39
Hyperinflation is Coming to the turks
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:05:07
the thing is , 80% of people didnt even heard of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-16 09:22:53
you are wrong, 80% of the world doesnt even know what a bitcoin is still. even if the middle class buys some bitcoin it would be enough for bitcoin to go to 1million
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:20:37
2018 - 2019 , when apple crash to 100 billion
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:16:22
get lvl 18 first
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:56:11
the same dudes are placing buy orders for anyone that panic sells.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:35:43
check Venezuela and you know whats coming for turkey
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:35:03
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:37:50
say that when US dollar gets 1000000% hyper inflation like Venezuela. it is coming. no body will want the dollar then
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:26:26
ehm he? he said transactions cost 1/1000 of a Satoshi, yet no one will be making transactions so its useless
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:04:14
cuz everyone knows fucking santa isnt going to come up one day and throw nuclear bombs from the skys.
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:32:35
im not buying until we go back to 20k, then ill fomo in.
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:41:19
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:06:12
0 or 1 million!
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:48:05
until you learn that there is no such thing as climate change and its just nature
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:38:52
youll see in couple weeks
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:53:59
to bad you cant pay with btc for nothing
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:44:53
its actually very easy to top that. just get ONE famous or rich person to say he is invested in bitcoin , or get ONE country adopting bitcoin as their currency , easy
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:26:37
you finaly realised that you are a modern slave to the rich ! congrats !
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:21:58
WHEN LAMBO?
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:16:25
again. the "market movers" loaded up on shorts and then created FUD news. yes. they are that powerful belive it or not
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:01:54
fall of a cliff
@_date: 2018-08-14 08:00:10
when m-m-moon?
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:14:02
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:20:45
im not going to teach how to trade ,yet you will one day learn some candle patterns eventually if you stay long enough in this game
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:04:50
this will be the fuel to the moon
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:01:29
is it unrealistic tho
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:29:52
i member times when we had 300k unconfirmed transactions! those were the days. good ol days
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:20:20
so you trying to say banks control btc?
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:51:23
what a tool
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:06:06
trust me. if we go to 5.8 again it will NOT Hold this time
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:56:28
there is no such thing as a gap close in crypto since the market never close
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:30:06
exit all crypto markets. btc going to 3k VERY soon, alts will drop another 50% from here
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:21:14
over 9000
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:15:12
great another shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:33:27
not many , like 5
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:18:55
"We heard BTC is manipulated, well soon you can enjoy the NEXT level of manipulation"
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:29:25
its Satoshi nakamoto himself manipulating the market!
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:14:17
8k is the new moon.
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:31:07
holy fack. BULLISH , LOAD UP . moon inc .
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:27:54
when? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:34:09
100% exactly
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:20:05
then its moon ofc but we dont know if they are hodlers or "bad intention " people
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:21:14
"The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. " 
How can this guy manage so much money yet knows nothing about stuff
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:16:19
it hang around 6k for a week or two clearly building a bottom and you failed to buy then.. no one to blame
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:17:18
you dont know what people do with the OTC bought bitcoins. they might dump them on a exchange
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:57:40
sad but true
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:25:11
volume is useless
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:43:55
but he cant
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:05:31
to da moon
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:45:34
we need to go to 1,5k again to weed out the non believers and moon boys
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:13:32
shhhh dont teach the secret. let them all panic sell mauahahah
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:43:34
december 2019
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:55:54
the dips is dipper but the dippening is the real dip
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:54:42
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:35:52
the fact that this thread is the most acvtive about bitcoin tells me everyone only wants money / dont care about bitcoin ( moonbois still there) prepare for 2k bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:55:28
also 44% accuracy , i mean what, i would delete that site right now if i would be the owner
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:24:33
ever heard of bitmex?
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:15:15
wealth transfer 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:30:40
coincidence that the volume is so low after the report of US wants to go after manipulators? i think not!. they all stopped maybe lol
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:28:39
from my experience it is not because the interest is low. ive seen this many times , usually before breakout up or down no one knows
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:27:55
so he lives without a house forever under the bridge patiently waiting
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:55:15
you got no clue
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:11:12
sadly people blame news for the dump. its actually the other way around. news gets created after the movement . think 
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:10:48
nothing is impossible
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:54:38
i dont know when but certainly before 8k
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:54:41
30% cheaper ? lets go
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:48:07
another clueless guy , hey!
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:41:06
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:12:12
more like 6k today
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:43:17
guess what. whole world is seeing that. guess whats always happens? the opposite
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:38:56
R.I.P Bitcoin 2018
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:07:48
more like 2k
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:33:39
ded cone
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:52:28
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:02:33
yes, did you even read mine?
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:43:32
well i shorted at 7520 and SL is 8000 so yeah im betting xD
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:35:43
that i agree with. retail is pretty much dead until the next FOMO run at 20k , until we reach that, i doubt we see retail back
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:46:51
around 2050. yes. im a time traveler
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:08:36
i think if this reddit could move the price then we were at 1million already. this reddit is like 0.001% of the market. thus meaningless
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:07:54
you have to think outside of the game. what if "bad people that wants to keep the price low or collapsing it all together " buying as many bitcoins as they can for 8k just to dump on a exchange ?
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:27:04
gdax best
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:14:46
YES, buy them all
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:11:58
it will get to 20k again , no one knows when tho , it could be 1 year or 10years YET SOMEDAY it will
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:27:22
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:24:03
say you are a buisness threatened buy the rise of bitcoin, (or goverment) you want to do anything in your power to crash bitcoin, thats one example
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:16:39
since we know it will EVENTUALLY reach 20k again, any price dump is welcome for me
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:48:46
what day?
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:46:21
ill buy at 2k
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:11:10
i clicked on your link , it just shows a gap on a broker platform which closes each friday means nothing as crypto never closes so you cant look at it like stockmarket
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:26:17
so you went all in in 2008? must be rich as hell
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:40:09
support also
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:34:54
on arrow missing, straight down to 0
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:24:28
lmao, expect a dump to sub 700 soon.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:42:10
chart says otherwise
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:36:37
so just hodl 
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:21:50
i mean, you clearly see those candle wicks from those last candles indicating strong rejection yet you still sold
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:19:00
unless you are paid to control the price 
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:31:32
how the hell mainstream knowledge is wider? just go around on the street and ask if they know what crypto is . i bet you 1 out of 100 knows
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:16:10
im pretty sure there are bots programmed exactly trading based of that
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:53:33
load the red candles
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:48:44
i dont give a crap what you "think",i know what reality is.
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:41:27
even if the US somehow decides it is forbidden to buy bitcoin / hold , bitcoin will still survive. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:13:36
says who? it can hit exactly 12k then dump straight to 1k
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:04:12
indeed , it has trouble breaking below 8
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:45:51
usually a sign before a massive breakout to either side
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:54:50
"not in our lifetime" what if in 10 years someone reverse engineered our genes to live 200 years longer , no one knows the future unless you are a timetravaler
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:51:56
over 100k
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:20:14
correct. new cycle down to 2k
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:43:27
i dont care what google says. i care about real world people. go and ask. i did
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:56:06
so 3166 then moon?
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:18:33
if everyone expects it goes up, the opposite will happen
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:54:52
still no buyers
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:31:15
sell and buy walls are useless . they are only there to create a false information. one day maybe you will see.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:24:23
price goes up when traders buy more than sell. not because of buying and spending
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:11:02
so you sold at the bottom like a moron and now waiting for it to drop more to buy back in lower LOL!
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:58:05
load the binance hack
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:03:00
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:28:18
if you sold 300 btc at once it can create a panic selling, so you are wrong
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:28:38
gold to the moon
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:31:41
i thought we are talking about OTC buying ? OTC means not on an exchange
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:08:35
because what you said might also not happen?
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:40:01
most likely
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:34:27
the hell are they thinking LMAO
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:26:53
the miners have left the building, same thing here , 11hours 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:47:54
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:40:58
Lmao Sheep. Keep Thinking this pump was because of tether. Muahaha
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:42:52
so who is growing our food then, when no one needs to work
@_date: 2018-10-20 22:44:33
ah i see, yeah i can agree to that
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:12:39
imagine thinking tether affects BTC LOOOOOL , get played
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:45:42
dude, interest ( new people come and buy bitcoin when they see its going up in price for easy money) , whatever you say dude, if we spike to 10k in 1 day watch how interest spikes soon after. because people dont want to miss the next run . you clearly dont have a clue 
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:09:51
average joe doesnt buy after a 700$ pump and dump. he waits until its obvious. at like 10 to 12k
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:32:24
Dude. 15 years ago i bought 1 cigerette Pack in germany for 4 Deutsche Mark. Thats 2€. Now One Pack is 8€ . 15 years !!!! 400% price Inflation but yet our paychecks getting smaller and smaller.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:09:34
atleast 1
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:52:06
so you basically agreed that he reads about bitcoin first, but why he does so all of a sudden? why ? correct. because he sees its going up and only up. typical retail trader fomo = spike in price = spike in interest
@_date: 2018-10-20 22:28:19
no idea why you getting downvoted. you are clearly right , i guess the moonkids are in full force today
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:22:40
this week 10k BOYS , 20k in 3 weeks , golden bullrun moonshot coming
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:30:38
wrong, interest follows price. ALWAYS
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:38:41
when lambo moon 1000x ?
@_date: 2018-10-20 22:39:53

@_date: 2018-06-12 21:06:42
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:07:19
stoploss hunt + create panic
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:28:35
i guess we were the greater fools after all
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:42:07
bitcoin is digital gold at this point imo
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:56:23
halving the bitcoin price every 4 years ! soon 1 btc = 0.5 btc
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:48:30
indeed . buy at 7200 sell at 7800 , repeat 10 times and its like btc at 20k :D
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:12:18
bitcoin as a promissed decentralized currency would crash to 0 if it was "regulated"
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:21:16
moon confirmed
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:43:15
so you are saying we should play it short?
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:48:05
i laughed at chinese new year part
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:10:05
so? who gives a fk about reddit
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:04:10
its over man, not like last 431 times , this time its very different
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:43:49
you must be pretty new if you think this is impossible , holy shit the ignorance
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:14:55
how is that good for bitcoin? bitcoin can barely make 20 TPS , imagine the world starts using bitcoin tomorrow LOLOLOL instant collapse
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:41:27
hey i dont want it to stay low, just being a realist in this bear market
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:12:38
tether is a scam
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:39:13
i wish for a flash crash to 100$ and then instantly to 20k
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:55:43
what the fuck dude, its over , finito, bitcoin is dead, no one cares about bitcoin , all people want is some shitty altcoins
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:54:12
sorry you are wrong , when the price will hit 4000$ some miners will just stop and the difficulty goes down making it again profitable for some others, thats like saying there was no point in mining when it was around 10$
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:30:41
we are at the brink of a total collapse if 6k doesnt hold btw , im talking 3 digits
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:41:11
what if i say to you we stay below 12k for whole year
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:48:01
time to HODL
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:46:25
they always will be in denial , even at 1
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:13:42
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:53:33
why do you think we are the early adopters? the early adopters were in the 1$ range, we might aswell be the greater fools in the end
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:15:11
yep, they literraly killed alot of interest in this market
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:05:59
early adopters they said
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:36:06
thats what they said at 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9 ,8,7,6k
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:22:38
just another bart
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:06:08
more like greater fools
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:58:14
7k is the new 40k , we will never be above 7k again
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:57:37
and then 900...450...200...1

@_date: 2018-07-08 06:01:48

@_date: 2018-07-01 21:28:47

@_date: 2018-07-30 17:24:34

@_date: 2018-07-08 05:42:30

@_date: 2018-07-27 18:16:28
im sure some investors will look for something else , no doubt
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:02:06

@_date: 2018-04-10 10:45:11
as McAfee said, daytrading wont make you rich , buy and hold will make you filthy rich
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:09:00
certainly looks like it from some of the biggest miner to put other "big" miners out of buisness
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:31:32
at some point OFC . no one knows when
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:24:23
think about it.. if you buy now , the potential loss is only 6,5k.. but what is the potential gain in the future if adoption kicks in? not to mention replacing FIAT? sky is the limit
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:46:42
"experts" these days damn
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:06:43

@_date: 2018-04-22 13:57:29

@_date: 2018-04-11 09:49:41

@_date: 2018-04-30 19:36:11

@_date: 2018-04-01 23:09:09
it would still be better than the current system where few BANKS printing infite money
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:21:32
ripperoni 4k lets go
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:53:14
not to sound rude but.. even if the "shop owner" accepted bitcoin, do you realy think hes going to open a coinbase account and swap that btc into $ ? he still needs to convert to fiat for obvious reasons.(bills) . not going to happen anytime soon
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:08:40
@_date: 2018-04-12 10:15:04
first of all volume doesnt mean anythhing. secound it could be sell volume more than buying yesterday thus more volume . volume is useless as an idicator
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:03:22
i agree, if everyone asks if btc is accepted alot more shop owners would do it , no doubt
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:04:57
if you think 144M will move the market in a significant way , you are mistaken
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:31:09
how? we are still higher than 2017, thus, still very much in bull market , its wrong in all points
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:18:31
if BTC becomes PoS it will go to 0
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:19:49
where is that. in Germany no food store accepts it.

@_date: 2018-04-24 09:45:16
someday it will. no one knows when. BUT..thats the ONLY thing that matters: someday it will
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:24:31
 you still dont get it i think. i mean like walking into the store to do shopping like you do with cash not internet
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:35:44
this man gets it. even if it drops below , 3-4k , that just means some miners will stop mining and for people where it is still profitable will continue
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:11:05
thats a 1hour chart, so like some days
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:01:58
hodling till zero or 1 million
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:30:03
again your opinion only
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:40:19
i say : under 10k
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:02:42
when btc hits 20k expect the moonbois to come in so the volume will quadruple. then its time to get out again soon
