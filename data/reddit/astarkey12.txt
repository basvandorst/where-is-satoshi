A reddit record label isn't as far off as you think. It won't be started by the admins though.

Also, it's worth saying that whenever I see one of your comments, you're always the level-headed, voice of reason. I strongly agree with your points about how the admins spend their time and allocate resources. The whole reddit notes thing bothered me only because I knew those resources could be spent on efforts more beneficial to the site. I'm curious to see how they reroute the funds in the wake of this news about Ryan being let go.

Yes, although that sub is unfortunately not as active as I'd like, plus diverting users to an offshoot away from the default sub that would play host to the label isn't the way to go. My hope is to pair a framework like theirs with the promotional and talent acquisition pieces of a label and the ability to reach millions of people that a default would provide.

The mods of have been kicking that idea around for a while. Don't be surprised if it happens as soon as this year in some form.

That's good to hear, and I think it's what reddit admins want. If they aren't going to be the lead on cool projects like the ones you described, it's up to the users to run with it. Mods should be more than subreddit janitors - I look at the position as more of a content curator in all the places I moderate and have tried to automate the mindless tasks as much as possible in order to focus on the interesting, mod-driven projects. They are far more rewarding than fighting spam, approving posts, clearing the queue, etc. 
Another project we're currently brainstorming on is a reddit music and arts festival hosted entirely online, and I've spoken with the admins about at least featuring it in a blog post. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

It also all goes back to the kind of team running a sub. If you have a highly collaborative, active, and motivated group, the sub will be awesome. If it's plagued by inactive, out-of-touch mods at the top, you'll probably hear about it constantly in SRD. 
I'm a huge proponent of the and doctrines for moderation.

That's octatone right?
