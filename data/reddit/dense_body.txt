Ya know the price for bitcoin cash has been surging constantly right? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:17:24
In every way
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:39
We dont have that? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:07
What is your point? Is that better to you? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:37:41
Mempool isnt empty... 
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:21:40
Its BCH, not Bcash. Its not a scam. This sub needs to stop being so childish.
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:23:15
Why would you use litecoin when as a BTC owner you got equal BTC and BCH post fork?
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:19:40
But you see it is Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:32:33
Whats Bcash? 
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:48:02
Your suggesting swap BCH to LTC, im saying why bother? They are interchangeable goods. Your suggestion involves an extra step. Not to mention BCH having cheaper transactions... Or even the fact its Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:33:06
Whats Bcash?
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:23:14
I didnt speak to my logic so im not sure how you deduced that
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:28:44
Thats one twisted version of what happened
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:33:16
Whats Bcash?
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:32:59
But it is Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:33:17
You didnt make it up perhaps but you perpetuate it
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:08:43
What he says still holds, desire to shift 5 million, must buy five million worth of Bitcoin. That's buy pressure right there
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:53:32
Similar to how the titanic was "unsinkable"
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:50:14
There as good deal of evidence suggesting he is multiple people from trinity college I think...
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:25:33
She "outed" Satoshi Dorian Nakamoto as THE Dorian Nakamoto who created Bitcoin with very little evidence to support her claim causing him to be harassed. She refuses to accept what she did wrong and generally behaves like a c$
@_date: 2014-10-03 08:38:10
Anyone notice hes in the process of posting a comment about how great the surface is?
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:33:54
Thanks for explaining this clearly, I wasn't willing to... Was unsure if he was trolling to be honest..
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:10:14
Have to point out that 100 coins sold at 1,200 is 120,000 dollars. Not 1.2 million
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:13:16
...and then there is an alternative to bitcoin. I agree with what you are saying though. I think the future holds a myriad of different coins!
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:19:00
Its just another way of receiving payment for good content that can work where existing methods, ad revenue, might not.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:56:56
Before I clicked this I heard "what what, in the butt" ... So close...
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:25:59
When will you be accepting bitcoin payment from Irish customers?
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:44:27
Lessen learned. When taking profits never fully deplete your bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:03:33
True dat
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:40:30
Tipping is something that gets easier the more you do it assuming assuming you have a disposable income...
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:31:41
Ok, they can divide it into smaller units... But that suggests to me that you mean 1 bitcoin would be worth more then yes?
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:52:16
I think running a nuclear reactor is a bit harder than running an exchange...
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:24:05
Why do you have a minimum five coin shipment internationally? I'd like one but I dont know anyone else who would!!
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:34:12
I just stayed an extra hour and a half in work because I was listening to this while typing.
Is he the sole reason the values gone up today?
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:02:32
People can sell their coin now and make substantial gains. I'm not sure what you are looking for. With an investment their is no guarantee of return...
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:53:49
ONLY 80%?
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:21:14
Kind of, but not really.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:52:19
Consider that as more bitcoin is distributed among a larger group of people its volatility is decreased. Volatility is and has drawn people and has been decreasing over time. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:57:11
Just ignore witchhoser, he has not trying to help you
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:43:21
What?! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:26:52
Have you looked at the historical block sizes to back up your theory that they will always be full? Because if you had it would tell you that they were never full
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:40:02
Thanks, i thought that might be reason after i posted
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:33:51
Your question and quote dont match up, he never said any core developers support it. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:37:59
Hey,  congrats! Ive been in your situation before. Just remember it will correct most times it surges high. You will lose some percentages of your gain. Long term my belief is youll gain but you have to remember that this is gambling. Not because bitcoin technology is risky but because there are gamblers (and regular folk) trying to play the price swings. Stay in it for the long haul and itll pay off regardless!  
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:42:10
In what sense ill conceived? Its functioning as intended.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:28:52
He means ethereum forked to ethereum and ethereum classic. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 09:05:48
Ya.  Dont get me wrong,  when i say its gambling i dont mean that in a bad way.  Just similar to gambling you have to be prepared to lose what you invested
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:32:20
Where are you pulling 4MB from ? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:20:34
Why is there coinbase specific code in this? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:30:02
So now the 3 of you are understanding why BCH forked off. They are not running BTC development well and are hindering progress... 
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:26:23
You do understand ETC is the original chain and ETH forked off of it as it is the one the introduced changes?!? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:16:38
He said "with major support from the community."
"The only significant group opposing it are the core development team"
He specifically pointed out that the community at large was supportive but not the core development team. And then you asked who of the core development team supported it. Read his comment again. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:37:43
In what sense is your suggestion the simplest explanation? Surely the simplest explanation is that the Bitcoin are sitting at that address and he has the private key but has chosen not to move them
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:04:17
Your assuming that he wants to move them.  Just saying, he's known to have said never get rid of your private keys. If I were him I'd just sit tight until I know what I will do with them. I wouldn't destroy them if I were him - even if I didn't want to profit from them. In life you don't know what's around the corner - why dispose of the ability to access money should he ever need it
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:57:39
Your existing Bitcoin will be at its address as normal. The network will just be operating with slightly different rules. Nothing to worry about in that respect
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:03:01
I'm heading over to Cologne. Can you spend Bitcoin there at all?
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:13:24
Discoltk was replying to jcoinner, not OP. No need to be a prick
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:05:59
Google "insider trading definition". All markets are manipulated to a degree with people who have information benefiting over those with less or who get it later. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:02:58
There was no insider trading as that does not exist in commodities or bitcoin, only in stocks. Insider trading is a legal term with a very specific meaning
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:52:01
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:46:49
You need to check your autocorrects
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:59:51
Is anyone able to use it though?
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:11:21
I'm in Ireland and with the above Bank. Although nice in theory the impracticalities of what your suggesting are huge. Maybe that will change though.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:05:28
Respect to my fellow AIB member and Bitcoin fan!
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:22:20
This would be amazing!
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:47:41
Is there a website recommended for Europeans to buy Bitcoin? as I've been struggling to get set up with MtGox for 3 weeks and now it seems I shouldn't have gone for them at all! It's frustrating watching the value go up like this :|
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:55:00
Interesting... however slightly misleading...
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:12:39
One iPhone 4 please...
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:46:21
I don't know which of you will be right... but I'm not really sure either of you win
