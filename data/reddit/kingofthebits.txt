Funny how you don't say that to the people who simply posted "no" and obviously got upvoted. As long as it'swhat you want to hear no evidence is required. So please don't act like a short answer is the reason i get downvoted. 
No answer, just downvoted. This place...
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:48:38
Just don't watch him do it or he collapses. 
Edit. Yeah, just downvote me to hell because of a joke. Did the price go down or something today?
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:37:21
Right. Every single citizen of Tel Aviv is adopting Bitcoin. 
Very accurate title. Not sensationalist. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:14:08
Can you show some evidence of all these whales, smart money and what not secretly buying "cheap" coins?
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:54:16
Well, good thing nobody here is stupid enough to still be paying for these scam services. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:39:43
Is anything here ever not a good sign?
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:33:24
People like you is the reason why that sub exists. But the irony will probably fly over your head. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:32:06
So now that the price won't go up anymore we just switch things around and act like this is now good for Bitcoin? Really?
If tomorrow the price goes up 50 dollars will you post how bad that is? Or will that be suddenly good as well?
Edit. The downvoting in this sub is completely insane. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:33:58
Bat shit crazy post of the day. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:50:19
Amazing how upset 1 comment makes you. Bought high, didn't you?
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:09:50
Obviously nothing would stop them. There is no blockchain police. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:45:53
Manipulation by who exactly? And why? Some sources would be nice as well. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:35:48
This is the same guy who created that ridiculous title. Don't get too excited yet. And even if this is true probably half of them won't offer it anymore once you ask for it. 
Why all the downvotes??
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:35:55
You really can't figure out my point?
Try to answer my question and you'll get the point. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:14:38
Your friend sounds bat shit crazy. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:52:32
Ok. 
Now back to my question. 
Who is infiltrating this sub? Why? Can you show some examples?
I really hope you will answer me this time. Thanks in advance. 
Edit: it's clear you're not gonna answer my question. I wonder why. I'd almost think because you have no answer but that would be so dumb that i can't believe this is the case. So i'm just gonna assume you're eating and will answer me when you get back. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:32:49
I don't. I do care about the fact that people try to censor me for having a different opinion than they do. I think it's extremely childish. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:50:52
Right. It can't be traders, darknet users, random people...
That's your evidence?
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:21:54
Uh what?
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:30:59
What was his previous nick?
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:30:18
No idea why you linked that but still feel free to answer my question.
Who is infiltrating this sub? Why? Can you show some examples?
 
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:43:03
Hold on, i'm calculating how many 0.007 cent donations that is. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:59:20
About 2 years too late. 
Edit: it's truly insane how i'm getting downvoted to hell for answering him. Why even have a sub to discuss things when you simply won't allow any opposing views?
It's clear there is only one answer ALLOWED to his question. Think about it how ridiculous this is. 
The voting system doesn't exist just so you can remove any opinions you don't like. The fact that people even use it for that is just crazy to me.
