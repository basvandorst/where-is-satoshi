Oh look, it's Bitcoin's PayPal.

The real way you got around it is to display the credit card prices but offer a cash discount.

Mine too, but that's tacky.

So, what are you doing other than deriding the efforts of others?

You still don't get what I'm saying, do you?

No worries - I'm sorry you lost your dad. It sucks.

No I'm not saying that at all.
The person offering the bounty is doing something to raise awareness of bitcoin. You are deriding his efforts and attacking someone who's doing something positive. By taking such a negative attitude, you're encouraging others to not take bold steps in case people like you come along and unjustly criticize them.
Deadlines are effective. Bounties garner attention. Whether someone will win the bounty is yet to be seen, but he's doing something positive and you're deriding his efforts.
Stand by your community and stop shitting on people who are doing something positive.

If you disagree with him, at least be respectful. "what a joke" and "this guy's ignorance is trollingly retarded" among other things is just straight up disrespectful and unconstructive. You are shitting on your community by saying these things.
This may be a case that the bounty-offerer is shooting for the stars but really aiming for the moon.
You also don't know that the guy won't pay out the bounty; you're making unfounded speculations.
I've said over and over that it doesn't particularly matter whether it works. If bloggers blog about it because of this bounty, people will stumble across it and it's going to raise awareness. That's not a positive?
The deadline is fine. It may be unrealistic, but that's not the point. It makes it a bolder goal that's more likely to attract attention. I'm not commenting on the feasibility here.
By the way, the percent sign goes after the number.
If someone's doing something potentially positive and it's not doing clear harm, shut your mouth and let them do it. You are, however, doing harm with your negativity, character assassinations, and name calling, and are being quite unconstructive.

Stand by the positive efforts of your community. Attacking people like this not only discourages the person offering the 1k BTC, but it discourages others too.
Whether this bounty will have a direct effect is unknown, but the publicity it may have garnered is likely to have done its part to raise awareness and possibly encourage smaller retailers to take a look.
I maintain: stand by your community.
