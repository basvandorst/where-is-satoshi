I always thought the whole name seemed incredibly nerdy and cheesy.

No, all the former mt gox'ers are going to bail out and the price will drop pretty significantly, like we're seeing right now

I'll be surprised if it's above $500 by the end of April. $200 by the end of the year.

It's okay to invest heavily. Never *gamble* what you can afford to lose.
But since bitcoin is a gamble, this applies.

Having bitstamp.com open in another tab is exhilarating. Just watched it drop to $645. This is great.

Well the fact that you label anyone who dissents from your opinion a troll could be a sign.

We need to stop comparing bitcoin to email. It's a terrible analogy. 
Email you could send a written message across the globe almost instantaneously. This was awesome and new and everyone loved it immediately. It did an incredible job of filling a need.
Bitcoin hasn't taken off because it's not filling any need. It just acts as an intermediary for transferring actual money. But it doesn't do it any better than google wallet or paypal (unless you're a drug dealer).

Annnnnndddd it's plummeting.

I think mid 400's will be next long-term hover point

Last December I heard a bunch of old grandpas sitting at a McDonald’s talking about Bitcoin. Reminded me of when JFK’s dad heard the kid shining his shoes talk about stocks and he sold everything. I think weve already hit peak saturation with cryptos.

Should we care about how the bitcoin network uses more energy than the entire state of Denmark?

A competing fee is called the 1.5% exchange fee from Coinbase and the millions of ATM's that use USD.

This is the only thing I could see that would keep bitcoin from falling to zero. It’s not going to replace USD and it won’t be used for everyday transactions. But it’s a very liquid asset that anybody in the world can store their money as.
What does that mean the price should be? Who knows, but over the long term definitely more than 3k.

Bitcoin is not amazon...

Are we still doing this?

Currency exchange is literally buying another currency with a different currency
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:58:03
It never hit peak saturation before by gaining the interest of large banks and people who don’t even know how to use a computer
