I.e., it is a convenient convention.  Nice bullet pointing though, looks super professional.

Uh, we already have ways of exchanging currency online- credit cards, Google Wallet, PayPal, etc.  Of course, perhaps Bitcoin addresses what some believe are shortcomings to these other instruments/methods.  However, that doesn't mean Bitcoin supersedes the problems innate to any monetary instrument.  Instead, by being unmanaged, it defaults to one particular attitude about money: tight-money, "gold-standard" economics, which causes its own set of problems.

However, there is a fixed supply of gold.  Therein lies a problem.

you should take some econ classes.

The gold standard is fixing the value of a currency to a set commodity.  Bitcoin similarly fixes the size of the money supply (more or less).  The babysitting scrip was also a currency with a fixed value.  They are all similar in this regard, with similar consequences: good for savers and speculators, not so good for people who want to use the currency.

Bitcoin is the ultimate fiat currency.  It is ideal for savers or more accurately speculators, to the detriment of its actual utility as a monetary instrument, and its recent run-up illustrates perfectly the problems with tight-money economics traditionally illustrated with the [Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-op](

Perhaps you could offset heating costs via mining in the winter?  I think there was a xkcd on that

Certainly, that's what kicked it off, but then it became valuable by convention.  That part is the reason why people used gold/silver instead of chickens as a form of currency- although many cultures developed their own 'commodity-based' currency.  What's so innately valuable about cowrie shells?  Purple bits of clamshells (wampum)?  Shiny bits of soft metal that can't be used for tools or weapons?

Or invest it, whichever, but yeah.

It doesn't mean that people won't spend it at all, it means there is a tendency to restrict spending on the expectation it will be worth more in the future.  Certainly that's why so many people treat it like an investment, and in part explains the bubble- tulipomania.
