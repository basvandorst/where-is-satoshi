Cool, I look forward to seeing decentralized computation. 
I'm wondering about the concept of DAO that has employees which get payed to do creative things like program software. Is that beyond what Blockchain tech is capable of?

I had made a post in r/etherium a few week ago asking about what it would take to make a decentralized cloud infrastructure along the lines of Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure etc. 
I imagined it more along the lines of having a Autonomous Distributed Organization that invested in a powerful decentralized data center architecture closely resembling what the established players are working with. 
These would then in some way create opportunities for other organizations host their apps on a cloud platform that wasn't controlled by a single entity and it would be possible to build large decentralized data bases (containing web crawl data, voice recognition data, image pattern data etc.).
So more organizations could have the resources to create powerful data intensive applications like Web Search, Intelligent Personal Assistants, and Mapping without having to ask the for data from the big guys. 
Some people then pointed out MaidSafe and StorJ to me. I have no idea how close either them are to this idea. How close Eris to it?

Thanks, I wouldn't have even looked for that. From the blog and forum post I'd figured the author had move on to other things.

After I posted that I remembered reading about a decentralized Kickstarter-like platform called Lighthouse that was to be used to fund research and software development.
But now I'm thinking that Eris is actually a system that looks more like the organization I'm thinking of. In fact I'm positive that's what it's intended to be. It'll be interesting to see which structure ends up being more productive.
