Is TOR not already in the hand of the NSA, because of the hacked and unsafe nodes? And if Tails is using TOR then Tails is also already not safe?

Yes but 6 years ago US Americans told me Obama is a hero and the USA will be free again and stuff like that... what´s up with these people today? You happy? Some of you idiots realized that nor Democrats nor Republicans will fight for your rights? Still not searching for a 3th party?

For the US only?

Ofc a 3rd party cannot win in the first years, but people have to start to search and vote for them. Maybe in 10 years things will change, but always only voting for dem or rep is absolutely not the solution or?
For a new politican party it´s always hard in the first years but somewhere they have to start.

I'm scared about attacks - I only have this one computer, running the whole day a node can make me a target as I understood.

Noob here: only know coinbase, when I was transfering from second coinbase wallet to the global coinbase wallet (dont know if you call that like that) - I was also waiting 2 days. So is this the same "on hold" thing? Or is iGot worse?

Yes but people who work for the US Gov can do whatever they want to - these are the rules. You voted for that, you get it - and you pay for them also (taxes!) xD
Is this not a good feeling?
