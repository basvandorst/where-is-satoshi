Yes. That guy. He admitted his failure. Doesnt the fact that his algo was beaten by another algo that was "cheating" by jumping ahead of the queue using secret orders with exchanges that "90% of people don't know even exists."

Conservative estimate regarding btc actual value, but we all know speculators are what make the bubble. I've noticed a 10x ish rule in crypto bubbles so that would put us at $146,570 Per BTC at the top of the next (or next after that) bubble.
.... And that seems completely rediculous and seemingly impossible but the sky is the limit once we break $1200 usd again. At that point the flood gates open.
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:32:07
Typically in a new bull trend, after the initial sell off we must consolidate and retest previous structures, which is actually where we are sitting now.

So basically Augur right? You are able to oracle an event and are paid if you are reporting honestly, and you are paid (in bitcoin) by how many reputation tokens you have. The more rep you have, the more BTC trading fees you collect. You also gain rep by being consistently right, and lose rep for being wrong, which incentives people to report honestly.
correct me if im wrong, but i dont see the difference

I'm very frugal and can live off of $9000 a year. I work full time and commute on a motorcycle, no insurance required in my state if you have a helmet. So I don't have to pay out the ass for car insurance. I don't eat out often and cook all my food. And I live at home to help out my parents. I've inherited money and recently put money into btc that i got from an insurance settlement. Right now I have all the btc I would want for the future. So I consider short term losses no problem.

I started at 700, but cost averaged down to 300ish. I believe it will bubble again once Noble markets and Gemini launch and the price gets a small boost 70%-150%, then it will make news and attract more investors which will end up causing the next bubble. Then it will come back down and the next bubble after that.. jesus its scary to think how much it could be worth.

When you look at the chart, the green left side is people that want to buy when the price drops to a set level.
Blue right side is people wanting to sell when it reaches a set level.
All of the actual trading is done in the middle and as you can see the vertical blue lines mean a lot of people selling at the same price, we have at least 2 sell walls to go through if this wave plans on going to 270+.
