Actually I did find that.
I looked around, there are a few people with that name who use bitcoin.
Also I did find his worker stats, hes currently the second highest earning person on Dwarfpool: 
I can also reason that he uses dropbox &amp; visual studio

I'm not entirely sure they can do anything- it appears that XMR is intended to be untraceable.

Blockchain.info and google searches show nothing for that string. Its too long to be a transaction hash or address I assume.
Is it an encrypted hash?
