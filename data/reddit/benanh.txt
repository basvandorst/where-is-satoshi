It looks like that to me ;)
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:58:37
Just for PR and maybe 10 random people got it;)
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:12:46
Interesting ;)
@_date: 2014-10-30 03:26:22
Good to know, thx for your effort!
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:50:47
Still looking for mine;)
@_date: 2014-11-03 10:13:47
Cloud Mining is not even profitable anymore until proven otherwise!
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:41:30
Sounds like another Billionaire is in the making;)
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:13:22
ACH can be reversible and that's how they go against frauds. You build your relationship over time not over night!
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:51:04
Will certainly try it out ;)
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:14:33
You can get rid of them and wait for Circle!
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:37:29
Shouldn't that also belong to the creditors?
@_date: 2014-09-06 03:11:55
Just use a different one like coin.mx or circle!
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:13:34
$5k per coin!
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:37:19
Showing panicking but still they have the right reason to remove it ;)
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:02:20
I don't have issues with Circle after a couple of calls even though I've been a customer since beta! Of course they now open to the public and they have to protect themselves. That's a great thing! 
Mistake happens and you just keep trying after a couple of weeks ;)
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:51:36
I have the same issue since they opened to public. Possibly due to the flood of new customers but they're supposed to prepare to handle such conditions!
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:55:34
The country is in turmoil and probably people are getting rid of their national currency for either Gold or something else! Bitcoin is also another good option.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:35:47
If your regulations are friendly to foster innovations we will stay in NY and if not we will all get out of NY and you can make any kind of regulations you want. Of course no one will follow plus no one to enforce because no one will ever trade there. We will think of other clever ways to transfer our own money!  
P.S: To add insult to injury, do you refund our losses when we make a bad trade? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:18:58
Why did you use this unreliable site in the first place? Shouldn't that be your mistake, not his though?
@_date: 2014-10-29 06:16:02
Use the centralized services until then!
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:44:22
Transfer all to a different bank which is bitcoin-friendly!
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:10:06
SecondMarket has better resources and good reputation when it comes to these kind of investments.
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:49:33
What differentiates you from coin.mx and the likes? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:19:09
Agreed, just believe in what you believe with your best guess because Real Identity or Not they can always run. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:37:17
You just need a small amount of bitcoin to be so rich, however you won't be living that long to claim it;)
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:16:05
A step in the right direction, I like it alot!
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:21:26
It is only if you know what you're doing and besides you can also trade your GHs
@_date: 2014-07-11 06:29:41
At least someone else shares the same vision!
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:36:46
You're not in the business of scamming people but that would never address the concerns unless you're a public company.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:00:42
You don't fight a losing battle and that's what his attorney is advising.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:25:09
Interesting, love to see how all this will turn out!
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:20:56
With such large amount it's going to be processed manually and it could take up to 48h!
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:18:33
They should get on each case and you can share the screen at max if they want to get into your account. NEVER ask your plain text password, that's just unsafe practice! 
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:37:41
Circle will certainly beat Coinbase with a punch!
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:41:57
This July!
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:13:33
Still buggy as I can't get pass the activation plus the fees are still very high; hence this won't attract much!
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:29:17
Simple fact, I've lost some BTC's there! I'm interested on how many who've actually gained?
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:02:16
I'm going there but with a motorbike so no need for the free ride ;)
@_date: 2014-07-10 10:07:13
Just wait for Circle and dump Coinbase altogether!
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:59:34
Looks like Coinbase got a great competitor!
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:55:43
Should get better over time and more competitive in the future!
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:48:27
Let's see how it's going to turn out!
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:42:18
Good to know but they are doing the right thing! Circle might follow suite...
@_date: 2014-09-19 07:53:19
YES, you can do OWN anything you'd like in your life!
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:56:54
I will certainly use it once available!
@_date: 2014-05-27 23:09:47
It's not an audit it's just looking at statements which anyone can forge!
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:11:36
It could be $5k after all ;)
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:38:45
Wait until Circle releases to the general Public!
@_date: 2014-07-15 10:53:52
Still wating for Circle, should be a great competitor if they do what's expected!
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:22:23
Too much for too little!
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:14:52
Let's wait until end of July and either we all can access beta or dumb the service all together!
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:23:05
Let's wait for FIFA to make it available to billions of fans!
@_date: 2014-07-14 10:00:55
Costa Rica blew it;)
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:51:29
They should let friends invite friends instead!
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:51:40
$500 is the bottom and it will hit $2k this year!
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:10:58
The Foundation should also spend everything in Bitcoin as a good example, NO FIAT;) Plus every transaction should be public and it is available for everyone to audit. How hard is that with the Bitcoin Protocol?
They can certainly spend 10% on charities especially Children Organization to teach the next generation all about Bitcoin and digital currencies!
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:34:36
I could only predict that it will go up to $2k this year. The next 5 or 10 years are really far away and we don't know if another one will take over as tech advances so fast.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:31:59
If no swift changes are coming to eBay/Paypal then all of my accounts will be closed very soon!
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:32:24
I'm about to do the same;)
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:10:08
Trying it out now!
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:08:02
This professor only shows his stupidity and ignorance to give such predictions like that. He wants to be famous and he has his 15" of fame plus shame!
If he's so sure about the future he can bet his job or maybe his life on it. There's also a subtle difference between him who is very well educated but can't be a millionaire and the ones without a proper education like Steve Jobs who was a billionaire and who actually did something useful to the society instead of talking BS!
@_date: 2014-03-24 09:37:38
They simply don't care! I sent them tons of support emails and got none back.
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:22:28
What's the single most important thing you think Bitcoin will need to make it widely adopted around the world?
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:58:54
Either he's a victim or the hacker but likely a victim!
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:22:32
Not yet but hope to get one very soon, maybe next week!
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:51:04
There will always be both sides and it's good to hear what the other site thinks!
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:51:49
No one anymore and Cloud Mining is just a rip-off!
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:47:15
He's not from the US otherwise the FBI would come to his house at this moment!
@_date: 2014-07-11 07:09:36
The more Choices the better for Customers!
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:36:47
It's up but maybe 5% ;)
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:46:31
Most if not all Cloud Mining Companies are scams!
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:39:50
I've got the same exact email response and pretty much now I can attest that all Cloud Mining services are just scams!
@_date: 2015-05-02 02:48:22
They won't last, keep up with the good fight!
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:00:22
Got to wait for a big event to happen and we'll see!
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:12:36
Most in 10 years! Of course it's never going to be all until we live in a cashless society ;)
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:27:09
Not that soon, decades more!
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:18:03
I got up to 50% already ;)
@_date: 2015-08-28 08:56:43
Get a great a designer and an awesome developer to do it instead of a Security Researcher. Forget about Monetization for a second as it will kill any kind of vision at this point. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 05:55:25
These brokers/exchanges are not your friends. They are like banks now!
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:57:57
Just DO NOT do it because you're eating their business model of 1%!
@_date: 2015-08-26 04:06:08
Get rid of Coinbase and Circle!
@_date: 2015-08-28 08:16:21
The developers he hired are just not good!
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:02:42
I don't have issues with Circle so far on anything and I'm not sure why you and some others have such issues. Maybe there's a flag on your account that you might have to call to have them remove it!
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:51:44
Better to play the loto ;)
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:57:44
There you go ;)
@_date: 2015-04-06 08:41:31
That's true for anything!
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:35:18
Sent you guys an email!
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:39:56
P2P trading if you can find 2 persons on each end, it's easy to accomplish. PM me if you need help ;)

Bitcoin represents FREEDOM of global trades and we still have people moderate everything we say? Where's your Freedom of Speech?
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:47:25
He could be arrested and this would be an interesting court case. Then we all will send money to defend this case ;)
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:48:06
It will be back if you don't cash out now ;)
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:01:26
With bitcoin, the only time that will ever happen is NO INTERNET!
@_date: 2015-09-08 09:26:04
Then build a better Reddit!
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:23:11
20k is a bit much on investing but it's reasonable if you can afford to lose it; however no one knows how much it will cost in a couple of years!
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:22:11
Abuse of power and he deserves to be in prison!
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:50:09
This is a great news but the price is still being manipulated and it's down at the moment. With this kind of news it should hit $300+!
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:44:21
Should be fun, never got one tip from here!
@_date: 2015-02-05 07:02:37
Good news but not market mover!
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:24:15
Interesting as I am planning to sell/buy more there!
@_date: 2015-02-06 06:31:48
Only WW3 will wipe it all out!
