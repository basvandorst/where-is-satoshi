But unlike gold, we'll be getting far more than 1% more per year of this nonsense from the mainstream filler "news" sources.

If the volatility is depressing, that's probably a sign that you shouldn't be investing in this. Make sure you never invest more than you can afford to lose. Remember that there is *always* the chance that something major could happen while you sleep, and the price of BTC plummets to near zero. Seems unlikely at this point, but there's a chance (Coinbase getting hacked, private key generation bug allows for major thefts, some new type of DDOS attack on the network, draconian regulations, etc.).

Yes, it's been possible since iOS 6. See [this post](

I consider crypto as a piece of my investment/retirement portfolio.
My wife and I have some of her student loan debt remaining as well as a mortgage on our home. However, both of those loans are in the 2-3.25% interest range. Most investments will beat 3.25% on average, so we've chosen to not pay them off immediately, and we invest that money instead. 
If you have any debt over that rate, I would advise you to pay it off before investing in anything. After that, save up an emergency fund in cash. Preferably, that should last you 3-6 months if emergency strikes (lost job, major accident, etc.).
After that, invest in a 401k (US only), especially if your company offers one with a matching bonus. Many other countries have similar investment vehicles that come with tax benefits. I always recommend talking to a financial advisor. They do this stuff for a living.
THEN AND ONLY THEN, feel free to invest in crypto. And decide how big a chunk of your portfolio you feel comfortable having in a crazy high risk investment. Huge news could come out tomorrow that Coinbase gets hacked, or someone finds a severe vulnerability in the protocol, or an unexpectedly-soon quantum computer is built with the "magical" ability to guess everyone's private keys based on a flawed generation algorithm, or who knows what else. The price COULD go to zero. Always be aware of that.
Personally, I have a lot of faith in crypto, and Bitcoin in particular. I've chosen to have crypto represent up to 10% of my total investments. However, that number is higher today because of the huge recent price spikes. I'm fine with letting it ride, because I sort of consider it "found money". A gamble that is currently paying off.
If Bitcoin does hit $100k per coin some day, then that just means I can retire much sooner than I could have earlier.

But why wouldn’t you change the post title? It’s an article from 2017?

Downvoted for the completely inaccurate usage of “exclusive”. Also, the article is kind of trash speculation as well.

I just moved some coins that I had stored in an old Armory wallet for well over a year. My old paper wallet was certainly safe, but I figured I should make it easier for my wife to retrieve them should anything happen to me. I suspect I’m not alone as being a very long term investor that just keeps coins around and tries to ignore the price for years at a time.

Cool to hear about integration in places I wouldn't have expected. Thanks for sharing!

In my state, only banks or "depository institutions" may own or operate an ATM. The only exception is if you, as an independent business owner, partner with a particular banking institution. This prohibits the concept of "private ATMs" in this area as far as I can tell.
Is this the case in Chicago, and if so, how are you attempting to solve this?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:54:26
Sure, see [this post](

The articles I've read about Robocoin mention that they intend to be fully compliant with US and Canadian regulations. Are any of these machines up and running in the US yet? It seems like a big risk to order a $20,000 piece of hardware without having any guarantee that the city/state/feds will allow you to operate it.  :-)
This is not meant to dissuade you at all. In fact, I wish you the absolute best and would love to follow your progress. Please post back when you have a website (or Twitter or whatever) to allow us to keep tabs on this project.
