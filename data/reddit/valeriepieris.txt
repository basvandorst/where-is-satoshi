I would love something like this.

Wow. You're cool.

Someone with a 100 btc could take top dog on the site. I don't have more to play with. This will be someone else's fortune if it takes off.

I keep getting responses about electricity, but I said these were free-to-me in those terms in the post, right?

Sweet. Gotcha. Important fact.

mavensbot is not one of the site runners (I am), but I appreciate his promise to invest :) I also like that he said he would "soon", which is genius, because if he's already up-line, he'll profit on the very people trying to buy a greater percentage of his soon-coming 100 btc. I love ponzis. I just wish it would blow up and people would have even more wildly intricate strategies. I'd love to be overtaken by someone if I got to see something fucking fascinating.

I've got four returns so far.

Remittances are HUGE here, but I think mining in cafes is a dumb idea, from what other posters are saying. I wonder if there's some monetizable cool way to become the bitcoin remittance apostle of the Philippines.

Weird things that I'd like to see in a bitcoin note that probably aren't important or interesting to anyone else:
* "Forto per nombroj", instead of "Vires in numeris." - Latin phrases are a way in our culture to imbue things with a sense of antiquity and prestige, because the Roman Empire was powerful and old and Latin remained the language of elite discourse for centuries afterwards, but Esperanto is stateless, idealistic, logical, and has yet-unfulfilled hopes of changing the world, just like bitcoin. It'd still be readable to the average Joe, but would feel more like something reaching out towards a utopian future and less like something trying to counterfeit legitimacy from the past.
* Dog-whistle cryptoanarchist symbolism that would make the world-changers smile but just look like pretty garnishing to the casual bitcoin transactor. The US dollar has all its masonic symbolism. We should have insidiously hopeful motifs. James Soares's [anarcho-capitalist flag]( does a good job of transmuting an ideology like this into semi-banal floral stuff, and could be used as inspiration.
Also, having Alan Turing on the thing is sheer genius. A man who deserves his face on a banknote, involved with computation and cryptography, and misunderstood and maligned. Perfect.

If you're not already out, I want one! Also, what an wonderful thing you're doing. Very kind to us, to bitcoin, and to reddit.

Man people are mean :(

I am a dude. Valerie is my sister-in-law's name, but to make up for it, my wife's reddit handle is a dude name: mine.
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:29:13
How wonderful!!!!

You are so cool. I just told me artist wife, if that counts, and I hope she totally dominates this contest.

I have never been to India, and for all I know that's where you're from and you have way better guesses than me, but having lived in the Philippines I can tell you that at least in that corner of the developing world people who had smart phones did not usually have bank accounts.

Hey cool! Now I know! Some nice person just gave me $2, so I'm good, but that's very good to know!
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:35:27
Thank you! You're a badass and I love you. Someday I hope I can do you a little favor!

If we could get him to get one and then moneybomb it, I think it would serve all kinds of great causes. It'd get btc in the news, and possibly make a dude rich who deserves it, giving him a chance at fighting back all of the evil powers that are going to be on his ass for the rest of his hopefully-not-too-short life.
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:35:57
Thanks for the kind words!
God I hope bitcoin's differences are enough to make it take.
But in a world where Firefly was cancelled, I feel like people shouldn't rest in anything's supposed inevitability.

Or "bitkoijno", I guess, or it always looks like the plural accusative. Or "bitko", just so when it *is* in the plural accusative it looks perfect . . .:)
