As an IT professional, I have been using Bitcoin in several stages of developing systems for purchasing domains, VPNs and others.
But I have a certain implication because after the acquisitions, the balance is never completely zero, there is always some residual that can’t be spend because it is very low. The only solution is to buy more Bitcoins, to spend, to again have a balance always with some very low value and so on.
I believe that many Bitcoin users have the same implication as me.
One day I was leaving a supermarket when I saw some slot machines. The intention was to make customers spend the remaining leftovers from the purchase. That's where I came up with the idea of ​​creating a betting site where users can spend bitcoin waste of any value.
And the initial idea is here. The user can bet any Bitcoin value from B 0.00000556. The bet is to hit a single number between 1 to 15, the same numbers as the Mega Millions Mega Ball.
The rules are very simple:
1. The bet is to hit only the Mega Ball number from the US Mega Millions official draw (1 to 15).
2. The user can bet any Bitcoin value from B 0.0000556.
3. Payments not confirmed within 15 days are canceled.
4. If there are no winners or losers, the bet amount will be postponed to the next draw.
5. The draw is based on the official US Mega Millions draw (
The total prize is the total value of the losers’ bet. This prize is divided among the winners as follows:
Your stake in % = Winners bet / Your bet * 100
Total prize = Losers’ bet * Your stake in %
The fee is 14.32% of prize.
The value of your bet will be refunded with the prize.
With the bet, we can collect all Bitcoins waste in a single wallet with enough value to spend. This wallet can be yours. And you'll be collaborating with IT professionals as us who develop applications and software for common non-profit use.
Make your bet today. 
Thank you.
