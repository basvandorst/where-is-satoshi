What paypal really cares about is avoiding its service being used for money laundering.

I would have asserted gold as the best option for such scenarios.

Yet they'll be completely inaccessible.

You're confused. Cash for gold places give you cash for gold, not gold for cash. So, you need some money and have a bunch of old gold jewelry - you go to a cash for gold place and they will buy your gold, at terrible prices.

It's like how a Supreme Court Judge described obscenity - "I know it when I see it." 
lol i recently saw it again, too, since the site still sometimes shows the homepage but is otherwise down/screwy. It went from homepage, to weird page with msg from azn-name, and then to site not working at all.

You won't have money to pay for anybody.

You can't really predict it. A little over a year ago, 1btc was like $15 dollars. I thought btc was overvalued at $100. Boy was I wrong.

Did they actually use the gift cards? Otherwise it doesn't seem like you are out any significant amount of money.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:37:10
Sure there are, no risk of identity theft, for one. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:30:01
Yes, so when nobody has money, what do people do to acquire goods? Either they barter, or they take with force.
Considering a barter economy will take some time to arise, then force will rule the day. Guns and ammunition will be as good as gold.

LOL and you look like you are homeless
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:25:10
That's when guns and ammunition control. If you have neither, your stuff will be taken.

People don't want to steal your address. They want your credit card numbers. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:31:32
lol I agree with you.

Just like you need a doctor because all of the diseases (and bad habits)? Not everybody can know everything, we are a specialized society. As more info becomes available online, you'll have your amateur reddit law experts just like health experts, but the fact remains when people actually need legal help, their tune changes very quickly. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:56:46
You need one because of all the laws and regulations the government has placed upon the people, and ignorance of the law is no excuse to get out of a crime. So, people who do not know or understand the laws (the Obamacare bill alone was 2000+ pages and an unsettling percentage of our population is completely illiterate, for example.)
There are some shady lawyers, especially person injury attorneys in States with little tort reform, but really a good lawyer can mean the difference between life in prison/freedom or losing your life savings/gaining money. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:54:31
Not really, laws obviously came before lawyers. Literacy and education 300 years ago was much worse than today, and people really needed an advocate. Today, a lot of routine legal work has been made into forms so the average person can do more, but the more complex the case and the more on the line, the more a lawyer is required. 
Don't hate the player, hate the game. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:00:25
Everybody hates lawyers until you actually need one.

One thing I want to know is the agent's real name Carl Mark Force IV?

That puppy was sexist and only let men pet it!

And Obama wants to turn the USA into Europe. We are next.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:02:58
lol it's hilarious to me that people are posting articles with headlines like "no evidence of coverup", as if that's the end of things, when Hillary had physical control of what evidence was retained and turned over. Our government workers were killed due to her negligence, but hey it's Hillary let's give her the benefit of the doubt lol. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:04:22
Yes! This!

I haven't come across a single retail location that accepts apple pay.
