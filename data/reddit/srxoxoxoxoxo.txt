I should have phrased the question differently. I understand that the price is higher because its impossible to get USD out, but why is this the case? Wouldnt illiquidity lower the price? In theory a bitcoin that cant be turned into cash should be worth less then one that can be right? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:21:44
Sounds right

Yeah heroin in extacy pills was always a rumor I didnt understand. Its a well known fact that cocaine is cut with diamonds though.

"According to documents seen by The Wall Street Journal, Tibanne Co., which operates Mt. Gox, is expected to generate a small profit in the fiscal year ending in March from exchange transaction fees. The forecast, however, assumes bitcoin prices well above current levels."

This was my original thought as well. The shift is very visible and is happening very fast.

keep in mind that they still at have at least half the monies owed. That means theoretically people should in the end get half there value at a minimum

if you use the last wallet generated as the seed for a new wallet, wouldnt every person that generated a wallet be able to recreate the private key of the person that generated a wallet directly after him? lol
@_date: 2014-04-25 19:52:10
Why not just designate a charity or non profit org (such as TOR) to receive the coins rather then burning them? Would the coins be traceable then? Can you not see deposits into a burnt address?
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:30:50
yessss, a nice boost of a few hundred people spamming their email and arnt going to to spend any money there (unless they start accepting bitcoin, then they might get 2 or 3 new customers)......
brilliant marking ploy

@_date: 2014-02-22 21:39:22
You cannot withdraw fiat or btc. Nobody knows if you will ever be able to. Price reflects that

1. who says authorities arnt investigating mtgox's loss of coins? Just because they have not told us this doesn't mean its not happening.
2. My personal critical thinking tells me that fraud is more likely then gov seizure. I could be wrong, but why is your theory better then mine?
3. Its likely we dont have more info about the hack because of bad PR and a gag order by the court - this gag order doesnt necessarily have to do with silk road - could be any number of things - I think its premature to jump to silk roa
4. silk road is dead.....admins are arrested...why the drama show?
5. your absolutely right. it is a possibility. I can list a number of other theories that are also possibilities. However you said 
"From what it seems Mark is trying as much as it is possible to fuck with the investigation. That's why all the retarded information is published. He's probably one of us, don't burn the bridge yet. Mtgox has always been under attack by banks and gov and Mark fought for us."
What im saying is it doesnt really seem like that at all. Can you give me specific instances that Mark has fought for us? Or that he is "probably one of us?"...
Youre theory might be true, but there is no factual support for it.

Lots of investment "noobs" made a lot of money when bitcoin blew up. I had absolutely no experience in investing and/or trading and ended up with a 15k portfolio from a 1k investment just because I got into BTC earlier then most. I bet theres at least a few guys that have no idea what they are doing but are sitting on a few million
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:04:25

right, but if the new address seed is the previously generated address, then the person who generated that previous address knows the seed of the following address?

When I first bought bitcoin in early 2012 Mtgox was one of the only exchanges. I had some money there from that period, along with other exchanges. It wasnt all my holdings but it was substantial for me. I did most of my active trading on Gox and this was my main hot wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:32:27


I am not familiar with Japanese law, but if this was under U.S. jurisdiction there is no real need to get bogged down in bitcoin or technicalities. According MtGox own filings, they allowed the exchange to continue operating and collecting fees after they knew the coins were missing. Fraud , unjust enrichment and unfair business practices wouldn't be difficult to prove and it doesn't matter if the product was bitcoin or bananas. While these charges probably woudnt help creditors get their money back, it sure as hell would send Karpeles to jail. I wont be suprised if this happens after the bankruptcy proceedings are over. 
Then again its Japan, so i really have no idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:53:09
What if the coins are tumbled? Also, if the theft has been ongoing for multiple years, most of the coins have most likely been sold lready
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:17:26
I dont understand. Even looking at gox market depth right now which is supposed to have less volume then btce - it would take about 40,000 bitcoins to bring the price own to the 100 level. How can 4k bitcoins have such a drastic effect on btce?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:40:42
atn the current btc price - I made an extra 3k on top of what i started with 
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:41:28
Is this just a large limit order at 261 so everytime it hits that the price shoots back up? 
This is purely out of curiosity

Not sure I get it...If i make a bunch of fake accounts, buy a bunch of items from myself, I would be able to write reviews and would just be "paying" myself. There doesnt seem to be a commission fee so I could do that as many times as I want. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:20:28
To clarify, I don't necessarily think that there is "tension" between the two camps. However I do think there is a shift happening from an experiment/idea to a well funded machine.

would somebody ELI5 how this is any different then OTC stocks other then the fact that it uses a more decentralized system? 
I thought OTC stocks by definition "sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange."

I think he meant that they are temporarily unavailable, but hopefully with a future buyout/arbitrge the will become available gain, despite the 750k loss

This is mainly an investment magazine so I think I wan to stay away from talking about how the protocol works (its been explained many times by people much smarter than me). I want to focus more on how the protocol can grow. Def. will talk about additional layers as well as fees and community!
