Hi u/vexornavyissue \-  
Exodus is a non-custodial wallet meaning that you hold all information regarding your assets on your own computer. Exodus does not require you to enter your name, address or any personal information in order to use the wallet. So Exodus couldn't report any data even if they wanted to.

Agree that "best" is a subjective term. But considering that you're new, Exodus is probably the easiest with great 24/7 support.  You can pair it with a Trezor hardware wallet for extra security. The Exodus team has done an awesome job so you can seamlessly link the two and has a beautiful user interface.

The local copy of your wallet signed it, not Exodus the company - Exodus the company cannot access your wallet.    
All operations of the wallet happen locally on your computer. You hold all keys encrypted on your computer. There's no account like an exchange where they hold your information and your keys.  
You really should know more about what you're talking about before you go out and trash someone.

Thanks for reaching out to us on Twitter u/Manticlops.  
Thousands of people use the Exodus exchange feature everyday without issue. It is **extremely rare**  that exchanges are ever held and only happens when an exchange is flagged if it is suspected of being  connected to a blacklisted address.   
Any KYC claims made in the past were made honestly and with the full belief that KYC would not be an issue. Changing crypto regulations in some jurisdictions and just plain regulatory uncertainty is the reality within the crypto space and we may need to alter our processes to avoid such situations in the future.   
We're truly sorry if our claims came off as dishonest. We always try to be as honest and transparent as possible and will alter any future communications to try to reflect the current regulatory climate.

Exodus no longer sends out email recovery links. And there has never been any ties between your wallet and Exodus the company. All files are stored on your own computer/phone. Which is great because then you control all your own crypto and hold all your own private keys but it does necessitate that you follow better security practices in order to protect your assets. Unfortunately, most people are pretty lazy with their computer security and end up getting hacked or putting their 12-word seed phrase into a scammy website. 
Been using Exodus for a couple of years with absolutely no issues. UI is awesome. Available on Android and iOS. And the desktop pairs up seamlessly with a Trezor hardware wallet for extra security. Love it.

We're so sorry that this has happened and escalated to this level. We are in contact with with the CoinSwitch team on a continual basis trying to clear this up and have been in contact several times with the customer. We've even offered a video call to further discuss the issues with this exchange and what is being done about it. We admit that we aren't happy at all with how this has gone but are still working to make it right. This definitely isn't the experience that we want for any of our customers!
We  work with our exchange partners who follow their own Terms of Service.   So although exchanges go through the vast majority of the time without any issues, this is a one-off case where our partner has flagged this  exchange because they required further information before the exchange order could be completed.  Thousands of people use the Exodus exchange feature everyday without issue. It is **extremely rare** that exchanges are ever held and only happens when an exchange is flagged.
Because Exodus is not a custodial service we do not engage in identity-gathering KYC procedures - unfortunately we are finding out that this is not always true for some of our exchange partners in certain rare circumstances. Because we believe in non-custodial wallet solutions and the right for everyone to control their own finances, we dislike regulations which make situations like this happen and are looking at ways to eliminate issues like this in the future.
Rest assured, we have several people on the team who are still working on this and will continue to do so until it's resolved.

Hi everyone. D-Day here from the Exodus team.
This is a terrible experience that we do not wish on any customer. We've really let you down. We've reached out to our partner and they will be contacting you directly again.
We work with our exchange partners who follow their own Terms of Service. So although exchanges go through 99.9% of the time without any issues, this is a one-off case where our partner CoinSwitch has flagged this exchange because they require further information before the order can be completed. We would not normally have a customer contact one of our partners regarding an exchange – we would take that on ourselves. Unfortunately, our partner will not complete the exchange in this case without direct contact with the customer.
Because Exodus is not a custodial service we do not engage in KYC procedures – unfortunately, something with this exchange got flagged at Coinswitch where they felt it was necessary. Again, so sorry for this terrible experience and we will be working hard in the future to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

Yes but when you sell it, you're only paying capital gains on the difference - not on the original income when you took possession of it.
