This is a much much better read than the clickbaity title suggests

Yes, don't believe they can be hacked - the biggest vulnerability is you. If someone wanted your bitcoin they could threaten you or your family to make you give up the seed and then they don't even need the Trezor.

Is their a tl;dr version?

Just hodl and hope it gets recognised as a currency so you won't have to pay capital gains on purchases.

Haha defeats the point of a lock if you leave the key next to it...

As someone that works in a fund don't think any of the directors understand it properly. 
Generally any discussion of bitcoin gets one of a few responses (i) the price has risen pretty dramatically, this looks like a bubble, (ii) the classic MySpace/Facebook argument or (iii) there's a lot of individual reputational risk to investing in something that is so new.

Use a VPN my dude, you should anyway

Of course it's profit. The big blockers are trying to take control of bitcoin so they can milk it for profit. We already have PayPal and it works well.

Depends if you have a US bank account and a US ID if so then no problem. If you want to use your bank account from another country I'd suggest trying somewhere else. I'm from the UK living in the US and I've been trying to get verified since January. All I get is automated support responses.

Who would fund it? There's no central bitcoin authority. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 01:03:15
By the big blockers...

Yep if someone knows your seed they can get access to your bitcoin. Probably makes sense to keep the trezor on you and put the seed in the deposit box so you have a back up and can actually use your wallet.

Have you done any research at all?
1) the latency of the network is important
2) is a hard fork safe if it's contentious?

If you think you're knowledgable enough to time the market then make that call. I just buy and hodl when I feel like it.

I watched a video recently where the guy claimed it would take as much energy as there is in the sun to crack one key. Maybe quantum computers could break bitcoin but if we were in a world where quantum computing is being weaponised bitcoin probably doesn't matter too much.

I've been trying since January to do this with Coinbase. Given up. Try Gemini instead they confirmed me in a week.

I have a ledger nano s and think it's great.

Telling investors to expect 10x-30x returns in their press releases. No clear explanation of what unmet demand the product is serving. Will still probably raise 00s of BTC/ETH. People who buy this are brain dead.

Depends what you're trading but why wouldn't you just keep it in BTC?

When segwit fixes the transaction fee problem there probably won't be a need for block size increase

Why do you need a savings account to pay you a nominal 1% a year with a negative real interest rate because if inflation. 
Bitcoin has returned ~0.75% per day so far this year. 
Make your own decision but all I'll say is i closed my savings accounts last year and my savings are in BTC.

IMO, the spread is simply the fact that people can buy it in Roth retirement accounts. If I had a self directed IRA I'd put it all into GBTC even at these prices. Most people in bitcoin are youngish - if you're time horizon is between now and whenever you're 59.5 and you believe in bitcoin long term this spread probably isn't meaningful.
