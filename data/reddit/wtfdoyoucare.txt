You're absolutely right.  You just put my mind so much at ease.  PM me a wallet address if you want a .003BTC tip.

You make a great point.  So why does a father of 3 children under 5, with no interest in making a speculative investment into bitcoin, have an incentive to purchase bitcoin.  (I'm playing devils advocate here,  I jumped through all of coinbases.com's hoops to get instant bitcoin purchases.)

This is a great answer (no I'm not being sarcastic).  You're basically saying that we've laid the roots, and watch it grow from here.  I believe it will, cheers.

This might rile everybody up, but to see bitcoin at 10k, I think we're gonna need "buy-in" from a much greater percentage of "Joe-Amazon" then we currently have.

I think you may be right.  It's like going to your local gold &amp; silver shop, swapping 10k of dollar bills for a few bricks of silver and gold, then buying whatever used car is available at the local pawn shop that is willing to trade for your precious metals, all because you're a metals / commodity enthusiast.

Fair enough, haha.  It took me 4 tries to correctly answer my security questions on coinbase.  These are questions based on my own personal past.  And 4 tries = 4 days.

Ok, better luck tomorrow I guess...
Nonsensical question 1:  What month and year did you buy your Acura?  (The answers were only months apart, and I bought it 4 years ago from a used car lot, so I took my best guess...)
Nonsensical question 2:  Which of these is the closest street to address X?  I answered with what google maps ruled the closest, since none of the answers were even in my city.

That's a great point.  Small, mundane, purchases are out of scope for bitcoin right now.  But we can probably argue that this is what will drive it to success in the long-term, no?
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:16:57
Goddamn this is a good answer.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:24:43
Read this: 
My account went from roughly the same as yours to over 900BTC, I attempted to cash out for the hell of it a month ago and it's still "processing." Don't expect to ever get the money, as it's not yours to begin with.

Point taken on the tech hurdles, but the instant gratification of receiving an email doesn't exactly exist with making a payment using bitcoin.  What's the incentive?
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:15:08
Picture this:  You're waiter / waitress at the Olive Garden with no knowledge of bitcoin, you've just worked a 12 hour double shift, and your last table was 2 tech-savy parents, and 4 very rambunctious children, and you leave me a $15 dollar tip in bitcoin, with a personalized message.....  You're not doing Johnny-Student-Loan any favors....
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:27:49
You're probably being sarcastic, and if so then I applaud you, but if not then there was no "none of the above" option.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:16:30
Ok, agreed.  I had to physically walk into my local bank and plunk down a  freshly printed ID to get my first debit card at 18, but now I have one, and I can purchase items online, or brick-and-mortar with it.  Why would I want to go through the hassle to purchase a bitcoin, and cash a bitcoin out, when I can use my debit / credit card that I already jumped through hoops for?  (Again, I'm playing devils advocate, and you can certainly go the ANONYMOUS route for this argument, but i'm trying to get deeper answers out of the community.)

Welp, I failed for a third time now.  I got the question about the year I purchased my Acura, but this time I was equipped with my documents from the dealer.  None of the choices were correct!  So I chose the closest one, and yep, I failed.  
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:28:16
It wasn't really an analogy, more so an argument...  I also hope to see it becoming easier for Joe-Amazon to purchase bitcoin though.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:36:05
Fair enough, but I think you're missing the point:  If I have the cash to purchase enough bitcoin for the product/service I desire, then I have enough cash to purchase the product or service with my card.  My mention of credit card was purely based on a financial instrument, and not as a lending tool.
