This is a terrible info-graphic, can understand nothing at first glance, artistic style has sacrificed usability severely, and the data will be inaccurate in a weeks time.  Perhaps a more useful implementation of the data represented would be in a web page with tabbed selection of  what data to observe?  Nice colors, that is about it.

Shitcoin?  Do you think we can get some Horton's with that?

They don't think it be like it is, but it do.

This is simple math.  Math is pretty amazing.  Now we need someone to really do the math, get some historical data, make some distributions, simulate that shit under a range of scenarios, and make some 420-blaze-it-No-Scope-Thug-Life graphs and charts.

The discussion you're transitioning to is beyond if a blocksize that could support transactions of Visa/Mastercard volumes is reasonable/unreasonable today.  Which would be best for another thread.
But glad we came to an understanding.

Absolutely there are businesses who could provide that service.  The reason for the Do It Yourself circumstance of the estimate is for the decentralization, locality, and oversight running a node provides.

You're right I didn't estimate the overall bandwidth used by the node accurately.  It would be up to the node host to determine how much bandwidth they allow their node to take advantage of.  As you point out the volume of data UL/DL by the node in operation could be significant and contribute to further cost.
An equivilently scaled node to the one you presented at 4.6 petabutes/year is 383 TB / month, 12.8 TB / day, looking at close to 5 MB/s continuous operation (40Mbps from a service provider).  Not sure what the DL/UL ratio is in that, though.

1440 minutes/day -&gt; 144 blocks a day
144 blocks * 0.670 GB -&gt; 97 GB a day
97 GB * 365 days a year = 35405 GB 
-&gt; 35.5 TB a year
-&gt; 3 TB bandwidth a month
Quick napkin math of HDD cost, bandwidth costs...












  If a business spent more than $4500 a year accepting Visa/MasterCard then hosting a node would be net profit.  Quick google suggests ~1.2% of a transaction cost is payed to Visa, so a $1M year business would spend ~$12000 a year on Visa fees.  
There would probably be enough businesses that profit from the blockchain to afford to have enough nodes to support it.

In the immediate run up to the Fork, I expect a similar influx of money buying into BTC as before August 1st.  Though this is the obvious maybe it should be said out loud.
Welcome to the new fork, same as the old fork, if all you care about is candles.

I disagree, and would say on-chain scaling is enough (for now).  The cost estimated is not significant to small business, and could be even cheaper for business than the current CreditCard fees today.  So, even a caveman-like linear growth to blocksize could still be viable for the short term (10 years?).  
This would be with the modest assumption that raw cost of nodes is reduced through industry improvement (HDD cost, Bandwidth cost, Server cost) and limited transaction volume growth (25% per year? not sure on the trend).  
There will need to be improvements to Bitcoin, and Segwit is a starting point.  Blocksize increase seems a viable way to keep BTC usable while improvements are developed.

You could try investing in mining hardware.  Providing security to the network can reward you.
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:00:45
Sure.  If theres a 2nd Layer developed and proofed that can address the problems Bitcoin experiences, without prolonged detriment and cost to users, without unaddressed risk, and with market acceptance, then great.

If you read a few lines up in that document,


I'm not a developer, but that seems to indicate that only BCC targeted transactions will be placed in BCC blocks.  So, no impact to the BTC chain at all.  Like two railroads running parralel, separate tracks.  "Miners not enforcing" would just be miners who are not on the BCC blockchain at all.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:04:30
Do you have an up-to-date source for that?  Everything I've read has indicated strong replay protection is implemented, and after the fork transactions will not cross chains.
