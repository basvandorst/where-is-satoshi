When it hit $48 we said "IT CAN'T POSSIBLY GO HIGHER!"

Which... is the point of the pool right? 10,000 people buy lottery tickets and when one wins they all split it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:41:26
Oh I guess I thought the "average pool member" would be a lot like OP - so he's a ton smaller? Thanks

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:37
Is this even a dip? When was it last this low? 5 days ago?

Well that would have been the approximate fee if the transfer was $4 or $4000 too, right? Unless I don't understand correctly. Therefore a percentage is really not a good baseline for comparisons

Ty - I was checking this posting that appears to be outdated: 
Because none of those buttons are available at least on my web view of the wallet.

uhoh lol... I just moved a few *into* blockchain.info wallet :)
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:58:55
This has been the argument ever since bitcoin surpassed $1000 for the first time. Yet nobody is really doing it on a mass scale
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:32:06
Thanks very much for the reply and idea! (Yes I just copied that from my other reply)
I was thinking since BTC has such a unique method of storing value (Public/Private key pairs) there might be a creative way to use that as a strength instead of the standard "ahhh pick a number" game that all other streamers use for their ______ giveaway.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:50:07
Maybe I'll just dump my stuff out to new keys and re-import them to blockchain then :|

I promise you it's not a few months lol - and I'm as much of an authority as him. Once I rode in a Tesla while it was auto driving :)

Did you read my edit? Sorry didn't include that at first. If that doesn't help then IDK at the moment but I am sure you own your private keys from everything I have read about Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:26:30
Thanks very much for the reply and idea.
I love my viewers but if the implemenation had scalability (meaning able to still support as user interaction would have to go up) that is ideal.

Actually for me it just takes laziness. I wouldn't exactly know how to sell if I wanted to...
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:16:05
Everyone is reporting correct balances. Of course this does not guarantee there's any money to back it up - just that the database is sound
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:00:34
I'll never forget the day my weird nerd roommate offered to pay his portion of the rent in bitcoin, at something like $11 or $12 each. I was like "Wtf no you weirdo give me real money".
It's okay. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:45:14
Meh whatever. I have my keys for 90% of my stuff it's just a bit in BlockChain.info. Thanks though. If BCH goes moon then maybe I'll try to figure it out lol

Six: OP wrote this himself for lots of upvotes.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:10:52
There's no reason you shouldn't be able to get your keys from Blockchain.info really, therefore supporting the fork.... often answers questions regarding blockchain wallets on reddit
Edit: Scrolled through his previous comments and found this:






Blockchain.info has been non-custodial for 5+ years. We've never held user funds. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:49:41
You crazy? We crashed back down to where it was 6 days ago panic sell!
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:20:04
Don't be silly. Your single choice to spend bitcoin at $15 is not any more powerful than your decision every day before and after that to not buy. You and nobody else could know the future
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:41:57
Is the fun part the way back down or what? My guess is we're within ~$250 of the top of the bubble
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:51:50
Well... I know everyone else will say you're an idiot but who's gonna be the idiot when you're a millionaire in a year?
On the other hand, what's the worst that could happen? You declare bankruptcy and the house forecloses, but you launder the coins secretly and still live an OK life... =]
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:33:52
If the BTC was sent after the fork, the BCH is still where it was originally (The private key of your cold storage)
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:06:46
I'm with you I'm not quite understanding how I now have BCH worth around $300 each where BTC didn't move much at all..
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:53:13
Yes we all know this sub's position on having money on an exchange. Yet you basically just said *"Even if  ______ does something shitty, that's your fault for trusting them."*
Mitigating risk is always a good idea. That doesn't make victim blaming ok.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:27:40
Yeah I know right? I moved some coins to paper wallets before the fork and now I have kinda no idea how to get them out, and I also don't want to re-print and laminate new paper wallets so... here I am :|
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:58:33
So... the fork is kinda like a dead stump so far? If it takes this long to mine a block why would anyone trust that network to make a transaction in?
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:36:24


That's like saying the chance most people to own their car outright is passed. It's clearly not...
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:11:41
I thought people already called them "sats" for short?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:42:53
Where do you sell? My coins aren't even honestly in a position to sell
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:22:15
I know. U read my edit?...
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:36:10
This is the most logical explanation available. The block hitting means BCH moved and can be sold asap... It's gonna be real bad when funds actually can move freely.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:15:44
better with sound 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:59:08
I'm always wrong so don't worry - that is why I gave up trying to trade.

How many other things could it have ended with to also be "omg crazy" though. "bcc", "bch", "fork", etc
Edit: Actually I see the hashes look like Hex now so most letters are not available. Still tho. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:57:48
Yep, about the amount I'd have had I said "Yes" when my roommate wanted to pay some rent in bitcoin at about $12 each. I was like "No you weirdo nerd"...
He's probably a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:26:16
So essentially since he sent the BTC out, coinbase just has his BCH for free...
Edit: Well it seems as if Coinbase is just assuming the currency will go to essential $0

@_date: 2016-12-30 00:37:38
I have what some would consider a significant amount of bitcoin, but I also have little idea how it works. TBH I don't even know if I can "help" the bitcoin network at this point without an ASIC (Why I need a running shoe - who knows). Like if I had a spare laptop sitting around could I run the blockchain on it to "help secure" the network?

Fuck it hasn't been this low since... Halloween?
When you say it that way everything seems fine
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:00:35
I assume it will go on as long as the scaling debate has gone on.
Which has been forever, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:29:18
That drop from $7300 to $6000 was the scary one. I thought that one was for real...

If you bought at $4000 (a literal 3 weeks ago it hit this), you still have the best investment in the world over those 3 weeks...
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:06:31
So, people who bought at $5 did a 1000x their investment.
But that could never happen again - that's depressing I'm selling.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:12:50


That's probably not even arguable. Even if you bought low, you then took risks every time you didn't sell at a new ATH. Therefore mathematically having taken the most number of risks so far.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:39:49
Yeah I was like "wait people are legit upset about this? We blew past 5000 in 2 days"
