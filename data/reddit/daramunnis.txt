If you look at it on a logarithmic scale, it was a lot crazier then the April bubble, and, it makes what we're currently in look completely normal.

She just said it. "Cash is still the best method of laundering money".

Sign up for a verified bitstamp account and transfer the btc to it and then withdraw from them. You'll get less $ for your btc, but bitstamp withdrawls are fairly quick, usually 2-3 days.

This is sensationalism at it's finest. It's just a discussion on a forum, and it's not particularly behind closed doors.

He/She was right in a localized sense. We could be at the top of a similar pattern right now...

I'm the same. Just made my first purchase! Did it entirely on my phone too, using the coinbase app. Copying and pasting the address wasn't too smooth but I got there.

Somebody doesn't understand exponents.

A friend gave me a pile of Butch T Scorpion chilis this morning. I am afraid of them. PM me your address and I'll send you one.

I'm a fan of Jennifer Shasky Calvery. She seems to get it. While she made her closing statement, gox jumped up $30. With a few words, she added $360million to the market cap.

If you want to sell them all, you'll need to register with an exchange (which you probably already did when you bought them). Sell them, and then withdraw to your UK bank account. This entire process can take a few weeks. Alternatively, you can use the website localbitcoins and sell them to someone for cash. Rates are usually higher on localbitcoins. I'm in a similar boat having invested the same amount around the same time, when time comes for me to sell, it'll be on localbitcoins.

It's been up and down the last while. The api is still giving grief, the ticker on my phone cant connect to it.
