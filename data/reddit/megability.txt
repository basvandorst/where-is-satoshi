Right, it’s pretty much un-usable now with fees so high...

What letter is that even, and how can it be valid in a domain address?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:55:23
Did you tell them about the level of fees involved?
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:55:43
You “just realized” there’s a serious problem??

“bcash scammers”?
He literally said he sold all of his BTC because “it’s unusable”, and switched to Bitcoin Cash.
Again, seems he knows what he is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:41:57
Or whatever...
Yeah still makes for a horrible first user experience
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:06:00
Feed the ponzi!!! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:23:38
Well if no one actually uses it, what’s the point?
Just something to buy and speculate others will buy it from you at a higher price?
Sounds empty...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:54
It can go much lower?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:31:50
As long as the fee was less than 0.51 BTC...
Otherwise it would have to add another input, one of the 5 BTC addresses, then give you change back.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:42:37
How high was the fee that you paid?
Probably didn’t pay enough...
Bitcoin’s fees are very high right now
I’m very bullish on fees...
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:40:19
$300 ???
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:43:26
Good for you...
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:18:34
1.5 days is unacceptable... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:19
Ask them if they’ll accept 0-confirmation if I say dial my fee down to a reasonable amount, maybe $1...
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:43:16
How much are they, and how fast?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:13
Yeah Coinbase is not a real wallet, since you are not in control of your private keys...
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:56:27
Your 0.000001 snack cost 0.001 in fees...
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:28:30
Yeah but I’ve had to wait multiples of hours on withdrawals from GDAX lately, so just be sure you don’t “time out” of your purchase...
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:31:36
No, they haven’t 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:18
They charge a bid/ask spread above spot rate, right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:55:53
But working as intended...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:16:18
...Ah the good ‘old days, when fees were still somewhat affordable in the low single digits...
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:30:15
You are 100% correct
I’d suggest an open source wallet where you get full control of your private keys, such as Bitcoin.com is my favorite, Copay and BitPay’s too...
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:09:21
So you didn’t actually USE Bitcoin to buy anything, expand adoption, etc...
Got it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:30:54
Yeah, that what I’ve been doing
(using something else)
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:11:21
You mean limit orders -?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:58:46
Something actually usable
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:27
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:44
Either pay more or wait 2 weeks...
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:30:54
Just log in with your same Coinbase info
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:50
2 weeks...
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:52:13
Oh man! I’m so pissed I sodl at $19,500 what I bought in at $500!...
Wait, no I’m not ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:01:41
Isn’t this fun?!?
The future!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:29:35
Of course!
That’s called “using Bitcoin”
I’ve done it hundreds of times over the years, because ya know, I want to actually own and control my Bitcoin...
Pro-tip use Coinbase’s GDAX service to save on fees 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:52
That’s just the change address back to your wallet, no?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:15:02
They will if they think the price will suxx more in the future, as I do
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:38:38
That seems pretty cheap...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:06:56
That’s a good one ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:40
About 75%
More to sell tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:30:29
In the US?
By April 15th of the following year
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:31:55
Seems logical... /s
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:24:37
Great idea, although you’re probably not gonna like the network fees, of ya know, actually using Bitcoin...
But  has been good to me a few times, check ‘‘em out
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:06:15
And you think you’re going to get that here?
Hmmm... no
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:30:47
Because it’s set up to be a “proof of work” system, the work being calculating the correct answer to mine the next block, this takes expensive hardware and energy and time, all measures of “work”
While I agree running a node is work too, it’s relatively much easier to set up, and harder to “prove” to the network
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:58
There are “Transaction Accelerators” that go right to a mining pool, you pay more to cut in line, just google it but I’ve never done it...
BTC is dead to me now for this exact issue, total bullshit...
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:04:35
Yes, the fees make BTC unusable now, it’s very sad it’s come to this...
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:58:24
Do you think they don’t PAY FEES to send me BTC via the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:16:45
How long have you been into BTC?
Like when did you first buy?
And/or learn?
Me, 2013, and pretty much 24/7 since then
But what do I know...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:42
Touché 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:36
Ha, no!
I used to...
But yeah fees are ridiculous, which is my point, Bitcoin is unusable now, it’s sad
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:31:21
So it would still cost me $12 to send $12?
Got it, how awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:13:35
How did they get “stolen”?
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:42:24
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:11:34
I think it’s 0.50% spread, on top of their 3.99% Fee, so 4.49% total which the math checks out on, but yes extreme...
Pro tip, use their GDAX page, limit orders are free...
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:16:49
Um no, please re-read my post, google more if necessary...
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:18:55
Define “soon to come” please...
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:01:58
Ok fine, assuming that’s true, it’s still fees they have to pay (when I don’t) and inputs they have to organize/send, out of the thousands they likely have to choose from, that takes extra time and energy...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:52
Meh yeah no one needs proof
I sold all of it too, just felt like the right time...
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:41:38
This just in, I see their transaction now, took over 4 hours to show up and I see they paid over $15 in fees, as expected, ouch! 
But haha... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:05:03
Oh right...
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:08:02
Yeah my “same day” wires take multiple days to get credited, it’s very annoying
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:36
So that’s the goal, to hope it gets LESS popular?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:19
It’s random, completely random...
You didn’t know?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:25:28
Oh ok, yeah, well they’re still gonna pay a hefty fee, as usual, I’ll post it as soon as I see it...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:59:21
I respect him, and appreciate his contributions, but dude really sounds clueless lately...
NO mention of blocksize
NO mention of transaction backlogs
NO mention of fees
NO mention of unusability...
BTC is UNUSABLE!
...it’s sad
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:56:03
True story
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:29:42
Block size has remained constant, it’s capped...
Do you mean transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:09:57
One day... maybe
Maybe not 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:42:04
So you don’t actually plan on USING your Bitcoin? Hmmm...
It’s just a buy and hold and maybe sell later game for you?
That’s kinda sad, you’re basically admitting the only thing pushing Bitcoin’s price up is newbies, like you just were, coming in, buying at whatever price, and you’ll maybe sell to more newbies later, at a higher price...
Think about that, does that make you feel good? Serious question 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:45:20
Do you know when it will come out?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:26:33
Yes, warning them of their low fees and fast confirmations, it’s scary...
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:37:53
Yeah that’s a serious bummer.
Even if you could send it with less or zero fee, it would likely never get mined.
Such is the case with Bitcoin now, it’s sad...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:10
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:53:20
I agree, that’s what a cryptocurrency NEEDS.
But that’ll never happen for Bitcoin with fees as high as they are and completely unstable transaction times...
Open your eyes.

No app, but if on iOS, save the webpage as an icon to your home screen, it will load more cleanly and keep you signed in for a month at a time too...
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:21:59
I see it now, took over 4 hours and Coinbase paid over $15 in fees, ouch, haha..
They only used 1 input too, double ouch
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:49:57
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:55:44
He is right though, for similar reasons
Just ‘cause it’s free to me, doesn’t mean Coinbase isn’t paying a hefty fee, they are, and they’re probably batching and calculating fees and block confirmation times 24/7 now, sad it’s come to this..
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:45:43
Nice write up ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:41:17

That’s their website if you want to research further, but hope you speak Portuguese! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:53:36
Yep, I’m pretty much fed up with it
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:20:59
Yes, 100%, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:12:47
Yeah I’ve done that in previous years, it was fun!
but the fees make that idea prohibitive now, it’s sad...
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:38
So true...
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:41:57
Nah, seems he knows what he’s doing...
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:46
I really don’t see how they can recover besides everyone just not actually using it, but that’s NOT the Bitcoin I signed up for back in 2013...

@_date: 2017-12-17 07:39:32

@_date: 2017-12-31 23:43:58

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:43:01
I am not
Define silly?
I tried to pay at the local pizza place yesterday, between BitPay’s required processing fees and the wallet’s recommended miner fee, which I even cut by 1/3rd, it was sill like $20 on a $13 bill...
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:57
Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:16:48
I had hope too, over a year ago if not longer, but yeah I’ve lost hope... bah humbug! ;(
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:00:24
That is an interesting thought
But to be honest, I’m done with BTC
I’ve moved on...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:23
Fees were NOT $0.10 a week ago...
They’ve been too high for months
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:35:32
In all seriousness, I don’t think there has ever been an instance of malware or virus stealing data from a DIFFERENT app, let alone one behind Touch ID protection, I think you are 100% safe...
That being said, a hardware wallet is always a good idea for extra security
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:31

‘cause that’s going in reverse lately...
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:33:01
I’ve been nervous too, especially after reading posts like this... BUT just sent some BTC from my Bitcoin.com app with a pretty low fee, just 30S/B and it got confirmed after a few blocks, then GDAX credited me after 5 more.
Now I’m ready to sell.
TLDR it worked as expected.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:29:49
“potential problem”?
Yeah, it’s a serious problem already...
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:50:29
Its not been solved
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:20:15
I think that’s the only option besides using a transaction accelerator and paying even higher fees
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:45
Doubt it
Well without a 6-12 hours block confirmation time...
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:43:14
I’ve been using Coinbase, now GDAX, for over 4 years now, practically weekly if not daily at times, with absolutely zero issues... so I say “user error” ... good luck!

Yes, those seed words are the private keys to control your coins on the blockchain.
Even though the Ledger software developed them initially they really are independent of Ledger, and can be used by any device or app to gain/regain control of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:19
So he said he’s not a fan, but he doesn’t know anything about Bitcoin. Which is exactly what he said is shameful, no? -to pretend you know something when you don’t?

Oh really?
How can I control BitPay’s fees?
And I said I already cut the recommended wallet fee by 1/3rd, still way expensive though.
I’ll give you a screenshot if you want but I’m pretty sure you believe me...
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:40:36
The IRS classifies Bitcoin as “property”, not an investment or a currency (yet)
Any gains from holdings less than 1 year are taxed at short-term capital gains rates, so therefore at your ordinary income tax rate.
Any gains from holdings more than 1 year are taxed at long-term capital gains, so therefore 15%, unless you are a super high income earner, and if so then 20%
Hope that helps ;)

You’re a “noob” and want to just throw $5K+ into something you probably don’t understand?
...just want to make sure I heard you right
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:43:21
What app is that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:24:36
Oh you’re the guy I sold mine to?
Well nice to meet you, good luck with that...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:49:42
I tried...
Many times
The fees are ridiculous though...
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:41
Wrong answer
I’ll see you in hell
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:09:53
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:33
How much?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:16
Prove it.
Where’s the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:11:20
I’ve bought several things with BTC in the past; pizza, beer, electronics from Overstock, domains, VPN subscription, etc., but sadly the fees now are prohibitive for most purchases - who wants to spend $15 in fees even to buy $100 hard drive?!?
It’s lame, and sad...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:47:30
So you’re not the uncle?
You lost it too?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:51:36

I’ll donate!
But he’s not really a bitcoiner, a comedian, so maybe he doesn’t know better...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:44
Not ridiculous, what are YOU smoking?
Damn, I really do feel sad for you ;(
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:59
More buyers than sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:14:53
Because he obviously has more experience than you, so doesn’t deserve your criticizing...
He’s also probably used to (and missing) practically free fees and instant transfers, as I am too...
Sad it’s come to this ;(
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:08:38
Why would they broadcast with very low or no fees just to let their customers’ transaction sit in the mempool for days or weeks?
At least that’s never happened to me yet, my last withdrawal I see they paid about $8 in fees, ouch...
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:53:47
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:17:18
Correct, well kind of...
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:10
What’s wrong with you?

@_date: 2018-05-06 02:54:48
Nice to see
I’d tip you but they’d ban me...
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:29:45
It’s for charity, you have a problem with that?
I wish it was local I’d go, now that you got me interested maybe I’ll just support them eh...
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:09:15
Yep... sad.
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:30:31
Yes, you are totally misunderstanding the concept…
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:48:44
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:59:21
Did my tip send?
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:31:05
Then don’t link to it, simple as that, you win!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:35:20
You’re stuck bro...
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:08:11
He won’t buy back until say $25,000, emotions got the best of him...
@_date: 2018-05-06 03:02:56
I prefer the green version, can we get a choice?
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:31:32
But the new 100 was recently the 10,000 right? 
So the 500 would have been the 50,000...
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:36:27
“Slightly experimental” haha
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:40:55
Then it hasn’t hit the mempool yet.
If it has, you’ll see it on that site or any blockchain explorer, and in your wallet app probably, but it won’t actually get mined in a block until you see at least 1 confirmation...
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:36:57
Funny stuff! Thanks Hodl...
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:23:46
So he actually said that, or “that was the gist”?
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:17:19
I predict the price will be between $376 and $918 short term, longer term between $0 and $137,415, if not higher... there.

Yes Coinbase Pro is great, set limit orders and just wait for the volatility to fill them over time, no fees that way too...
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:20:42
Hmmm, I love Ledger but so much confusing...
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:08:39
Nicely done ✅ 
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:25:49
2nd layer?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:28:03
Thanks, I did know both of those things and sites
But that does raise another question/request I’ve had - it seems all the BCH Blockchains explorers I’ve tried can’t do that public key lookup - Blockdozer, Insight, Bitcoin.com, nor Blockchair - do you know one that can?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:36:35
Don’t think “down 300%” is possible but yeah, maybe something I missed...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:48
So have you actually used it yet?
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:50:20
And yes Bitcoin is actually inflationary, just at an ever-decreasing rate...
50 bitcoins per block at first
25 bitcoins per block after that
12.5 bitcoins per block for now...
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:52:00
You’ll pay the high fees and you’ll like it!
They are there to help you...
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:54:22
You used to have a tip bot too, it worked well, it was fun, but died because of horrible fees, so sad ;(
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:11:59
In the US, yes, the process is called probate
This is why people choose a trust instead - a living revocable trust specifically - they aren’t that expensive to get one created and you can amend it anytime before you die

I agree, shiny rocks, seashells, gold, then maybe even a goat and chickens are a better representation than a cow...
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:35:01
Yes, that’s what I’m after, I have the 2048 English word list, but how does each represent a number?
I think only the first 3 letters of each word are all that matters anyway right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:31:16
You are
Read the wikis to start
And everything else you can next
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:32:50
It doesn’t for me, I just tried it again and it just returns an error.
How did you do it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:04
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:41:59
Hey just take care of yourself man, life is good, and good luck...
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:28:09
First, make sure you are really looking at Bitmain’s site, there are a lot of scams out there.
Yes the wallet will work fine, or any wallet that can hold Bitcoin Cash, your payment is simple just scan the QR code on checkout, I just did it myself a few days ago! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:53:22
Last month.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:29:33
Good for him though
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:24:49
$3,000 + fees?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:14:55
Do you know the first letter at least?
Well there’s only 2048 to pick from, I guess just start trying, however I believe the last word or words are a checksum on the whole list, so maybe knowing how that’s calculated can trim down the choices even more, good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:36
Wow, much cool, yo!... such dude
Also, Jihan better get that green skin checked out, yikes...

That’s not how it’s supposed to work, is it?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:23:12
Sure, that’s an address - just 1 address
I was asking about extended public keys, which would give you ALL addresses and transactions made so far.
Like I said it DOES work for BTC on Blockchain.info but I haven’t found a BCH blockchain explorer where it works yet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:55:14
Good stuff, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:27:35
The private keys don’t leave your device, the code is open source so that can be verified...
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:11:28
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:42:59
Do it!!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:30:36
FYI this is the real site, not “Bitmain Alliance” or other scam sites out there...
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:11:05
I’ve been paying $0.003 the last few weeks, and getting confirmed the very next block every time...
But that was Bitcoin Cash
Oh you mean BTC? Then yeah never...
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:58:01
Average transaction is say 230 bytes
So 2300 satoshi or 23 bits fee
So ~$0.20 USD
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:23:43
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:01:16
Yeah it’s an open source app that DOES give you your private keys, works great too, no need to freak out...
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:42:28
So you must no longer be happy then, sad ;(
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:28:19
Thanks but yeah I happen to believe that too, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:44:40
Wow that was a long sentence... ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:42:50
Are you serious?
They are 2 separate blockchains now, how is that even possible?
Are you saying some nefarious Bitcoin.com person is going to use my wallets private keys to transfer BTC I have in my wallet, via the BTC blockchain, to an exchange, sell it for BCH, then transfer it back to my wallet again via the BCH blockchain?
I’m sorry you sound very brainwashed on your fear of Bitcoin Cash, and yes when it has the majority of work on it’s already-longer blockchain IT WILL BE Bitcoin, simply Bitcoin, the one.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:52
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:07:47
It is, or so I’ve read...
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:04:12
Yeah I’ll just keep it simple for now...
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:28:08
That’s not value, that’s speculation...

@_date: 2017-11-11 17:33:28
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:50:13
Then you could say the same for any wallet, should we not use anything?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:30:23
Thanks but still doesn’t redirect 
Also when I find it manually I can’t download it...

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:15:21
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:04:39
Hmmm, that doesn’t sound right
So if you have, say, 12 words after 1,000, i.e. each 4 digits long, like 1,000, 1,001, 1,002, etc., and strung them all together, you’d still only get a number 48 digits long. I was under the impression the number set is 77 digits long...
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:35:24
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:55:24
I’ve used it for a while now and it works great, good luck!

That said sorry, I don’t know why the CAD conversion isn’t working for you, best I could suggest is check the settings, there is a choice for currency if I remember right
And good luck!

I’d tip you some cash to make you feel better but the mods would just ban it...

@_date: 2017-11-22 01:14:51

Will it top the all time high of $15/Kb??
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:53:02
I agree, it was great, so much cool history...
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:04:37
But what?
If Bitcoin (Core) and If you're going to use Coinbase, use their GDAX exchange after verification instead, zero fees...
I prefer Kraken now because I prefer Bitcoin Cash, buy/sell fees start at just 0.16%\0.26%...

@_date: 2017-10-20 05:27:52
It doesn’t.
I know it sounds odd at first, but seriously, the range of possible numbers is so enormously large, like larger than the number of atoms in the entire galaxy large, that it’s virtually impossible to pick a number already used...
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:04:11
Good story but yeah sounds frustrating!
I dealt with something similar recently but with bank wires, which are supposed to be guaranteed - and COST to send.
"Sorry, your 'same day' wire can't be sent today, we took too long to process it and it's past the wire cut-off time now"
Next day, receiving bank: "Well yeah we see the wire ('same day" wire that I paid extra for) but it takes several hours to credit the receivers account.
Hours later: Well we're past the wire cut-off time now so it will have to get credited tomorrow.
So 3 days for a "same day" wire I paid extra for, from my cash account -very frustrating!, and like you said, Bitcoin would have taken 10-30 minutes...

Pick a number, any number, between 1 and 146865353325764689097862574357644675347854... or close enough
I.E. an extremely large number, 77 digits long I believe.
Your 24 word seed (or 12 words) is just an easy-for-humans way to get that number via easy(ier) to remember dictionary words, but technically the words themselves are meaningless, just a code to get you that 1 large random number, your wallet.
IF, someone can guess your random number, then yes they can “hack” your Bitcoin addresses and all funds on it, but the chance of that happening is so infinitesimally small and would take so much time, it does not matter -carry on...
