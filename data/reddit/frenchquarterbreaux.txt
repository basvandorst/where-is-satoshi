What stops some one from buying on coinbase and then selling on the atm immediately?

I can wire transfer money between countries and currencies instantaneously. Plus, my fiat money is insured by multiple agencies, so, for example if I lose my credit card, or if some one steals it, I am not out of pocket for the loss. Also, I don't understand your second sentence, please elaborate.

Your argument is not compelling.
 


 
This is not a benefit to me. Maybe subjective, but I simply don't need to do this.
 


 
I get the feeling that if the US or any other major economy weakens, BTC price will be affected. Moreover, I have come to trust the stability of fiat prices more than BTC prices. Just say'n.
 
Your example cites the Zimbabwean dollar, which, while sad, is so far removed from me that BTC seems like a lotto ticket that's already been scratched and cashed.
