Im Guessing qawsed123456 would -1 comments rather then get into a debate of opinions, My mistake for thinking Reddit could be medium to bounce such ideals of one another in an attempt to become better informed about such issues :P

Count me in for a donation to squash these bugs! It really sickens my soul to know what kind of sick strangle hold these credit companies have on our communities. And just when there may be some kind of light for the masses to rise up and choose an option not defined by these same "dictators" They are willing drop multi-million dollar smear campaigns in an attempt to keep their grip on us and hold us down. The people need to rise up and put an end to this monstrosity!! We can only count on ourselves for change!!!

I myself am not a big fan of bitzino. I like to frequent casinos with a more exciting design

Care to explain your opinions.. Rather then throw accusations without representation.

One of my favorite bitcoin casinos is Casino Evolution. I played for a bit and enjoyed the software. I actually became an affiliate for their site. They offer a bitcoin and litecoin live dealer casino. My second favorite would have to be the classic satoshi dice. and third bit777 I really enjoy the bonus on their holdem table game

I have been an affiliate for Casino Evolution now a couple of months and they offer a great program of 33% revenue share with no limits or charge backs, for the lifetime of my clients referred.  I suggest any serious affiliate check out this site

Yes people have been freaking due to the volatility of their investment. But then again isnt that what they signed up for.. A chance to make millions with thousands. Now that the major hype of dec 2013 has calmed down we have really seen the price of bitcoin start to stabilize. Bitcoin is here to stay and is working! think about the leaps and bounds this community has made over the last 4-5 years. Us who believe in bitcoin as more then just an investment but as a revolution know that we are far from over but instead are just getting started!

It seems to me the whole world is in such a state as you describe in north america. I too have a strong belief that many people will adapt to bitcoin in the future.

This project was introduced to free the modern man from the tyranny of their governments and the international Banksters. The people will always find a way to get around these ridiculous regulations.
Stay strong Bitcoin! Stay strong China! We shall prevail!

This is just my brief opinion on bitcoin. I am not claiming to be an authority within the bitcoin community. I am just an advocate of bitcoins fundamentals and its potential power to overtake the typical means of transferring wealth.
