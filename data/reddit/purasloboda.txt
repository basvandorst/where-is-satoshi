Agree re the tinfoil - it's only on the bottom however and I thought it'd be a good idea to insulate the cardboard base should something spark or burn - better to land on foil than on cardboard?

Raspberry Pi is being fed by 5.1V / 13W power supply
Hard drive is being fed by [this]( 12V / 2.5A external drive
The fan is just an old case fan that I've spliced into an old 12V 1A phone power supply

You were right - I needed to connect to you first. We are connected!

I am running samba on the Pi - no good?

Long time bitcoin/lightning lurker, first time full node operator and lightning node operator.
Thewaway my old reddit account because privacy.
Don't have a great deal of cash but I am extremely proud to be the [\~5500th]( \ lightning node operator.
Put together this raspberry pi node with no bitcoin/lightning/unix experience using u/stadicus's excellent [guide](
Discovered this WD Red drive was running at more than 60 degrees C even without the case lid on, so I built this "case" for the whole setup.
Here's a pic of it all "sealed up" in the wild: [
Become a first class bitcoiner and build yourself a full node. It's not that hard and there are a lot of people out there willing to help, myself included. Tinkering with lightning is great fun and I can't wait to start trying out all these experimental implementations of micropayments cropping up in 2019.
If you are wondering why the node is called "Pura Sloboda", I got the name by combining my two favourite concepts from different ends of the world; the first being "Pura Vida" or "pure life" - a way of being from Costa Rica; the second being "Sloboda/Svoboda" or "freedom" - from the slavic countries. Both of these phrases were very genuine but have since been co-opted by governments for corporate interests or control of populations.
With this node I intend to be a small cog in a future of 'pure \[monetary\] freedom'.
EDIT: and yes, the case is a shoebox. The hard drive is sitting on a box that used to be a meat container. And yes, I wrapped it in aluminium foil. Don't really know why.

Will add some more funds to the node address this week and will be sure to open up a channel with you!

Basically what u/nolimitzman0 said, but I can add a little....
First, I always wanted to run a bitcoin node so that I don't have to rely on any third party to propagate my transactions across the network. Andreas explains this well [here]( To run a Lightning Network node you need to run a Bitcoin node, so that was a drawcard.
Second, to participate in the Lightning Network and make instantaneous and near-free microtransactions, you need to put real bitcoins into a lightning wallet. The solutions out there at the moment are fast and free, but require you to send your bitcoins to their wallet. Again, trusting a third party.
Third, by doing both of the above I am helping to directly contribute to the bitcoin ecosystem. Running a node helps decentralize and secure the network. Opening lightning channels helps create capacity on the lightning network. You can see stats on how it's doing [here](
Fourth, by running a bitcoin and lightning node I am exposing myself to the cutting edge of bitcoin development which I am becoming more and more interested in, while familiarising myself with its operation.
If you were asking generally what's going on here: I have a raspberry pi (tiny computer) running bitcoin and lightning software. The blockchain is stored on that big hard drive which was overheating - hence the "case" with a fan.

I'm not entirely sure. I was surprised it was running so hot but assumed that's just what happens when you don't have it in a case with a fan (it's not designed to be an external USB drive). I wonder if it's something worth looking into...

I am using that drive as a NAS as well.

hey bro, got an error suggesting your node is no longer online ? :(
