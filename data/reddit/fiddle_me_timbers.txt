You're joking right? You think all the other coins have $30 fees like BTC?

Google converts BTC to USD now, don't need a special website. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:03:01
Recently they have been rising and falling together actually. 
And diversifying isn't really about if BTC and other coins have similar growth patterns on a daily basis or not, rather it's about hedging your bets for the long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:31:41
So you're boasting about being on reddit since the early days, and then bashing that user for using reddit often?
Maybe if you weren't such an ass, you wouldn't need to make new accounts every few months. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:27:34
The link is literally in OP's post. It was on the bitcointalk forum. It was a girl, not a guy. They were drunk. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:10:29


Maybe YOU weren't, but look at the thread we're in and the comment chain I originally posted on. 


That is living on USD, not BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:12:34
You seem to not understand the technology or are a troll, or both. Actually research it and understand it before you say things like "obviously". Start with the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:51:14
That's all nice sentiment and all, and I'm rooting for it, but until I can pay my bills and buy groceries with bitcoin, no, its not the new money yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:01:51
Did I say that? No.

They said "forced to *pay*", as in forced to pay sales tax. They did not say "forced to *buy*", as in forced to purchase some goods, which is what you seem to have interpreted it as.

Okay. Come back to me when you can actually live off your Bitcoin without exchanging it into fiat. I'm a believer in cryptos, but as long as we're literally measuring our success by how much it is worth in fiat, my point still stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:35:17
fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:14:06
That isn't buying with bitcoin. It is still getting exchanged to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:18:16
That makes no sense. Europeans travelling in US would use USD. How does that counter what I said? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:22
Doesn't necessarily mean multiple BTC. People have various different coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:47:43
That is not my position. You jumped into the middle of a conversation where we were talking about USD, and then took it out of context.
Go back to the start of the chain and notice how I wrote "fiat", not "USD" specifically. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:23
Yup, I live in Japan and one of the biggest exchanges here (Bitflyer) has been running ads on primetime TV. Still, it isn't talked about much at all here yet, so I think there is still even so much more room for it to grow here.

Have lived here since 2011, and more people are using cards/payment apps nowadays. 
Cash is still king for small purchases, and bars/restaurants, but most adults have credit cards and will use for big purchases/subscriptions. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:02:18
It doesn't have to be backed with anything of "tangible" value, because the technology itself is what is so valuable. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:35:35
Early adopters for sure. Even if you just bought in for the first time today.

I bought my first bitcoin through mycelium and it took me through simplex as well. The fees were stupidly high, but I live in Japan so don't have many options (coinbase isnt available here yet). 
The exchange mycelium uses is bitstamp but it seems to use simplex for payment confirmation.

I wasn't responding to you so I don't know why you answered. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:15:34
I meant in the physical aspect. What would you physically do in a supermarket to pay? Tap your phone on some scanner? How would it work with a hardware wallet that has to be plugged in to work?

Oh wow, I did not see that at all until I saw your comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:57:49
It sounds like you're in one specific field though where fax is still necessary. In Japan, fax is used EVERYWHERE still and eveeerything has to be in paper form.

Why? Gdax does not have the most volume for BTC.
Bitcoinity.org should be the true decider since it is a weighted average.

The exchange with the 2nd most volume of bitcoin right now is over $10,000.

You seem to be confused (or maybe I am as to what you're trying to say)
B2X has not forked yet. It doesn't exist yet. You can't buy it yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:27:46
It could do harm though depending on how they portray it. I think any exposure is good though, even if they fuck this up. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:12:45
We already hit 8k earlier. Or do you mean waiting for it *again*? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:10:13
That is not where HODL came from. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:45:10

A hardware wallet, paper wallet, mind wallet, all are. If you leave your private keys with a 3rd party, then yeah, you can possibly get hacked. That is why people say to not do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:02:38
It is 10k on a few different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:04:25
They weren't saying 10mil per coin by January. The comment they responded to was about a scenario in which someone had 5mil worth of bitcoin now. So 10mil in January means that per coin would be have to be ~$12kish, which is certainly within the realm of possibilities. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:53:20
Also look into Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:04:08
wtf are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:51:26
I don't understand. I thought it wasn't available until the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:47:27
So you get .5 of each yeah? If you believe in core, you sell the .5 B2X and immediately get that back in fiat. Yeah, maybe the .5 BTC is worth less right after the fork, but that doesn't matter if you're going to be hodling anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:14:58
Dude, that price is listed in dollars. The price in KRW is 11892877.20 right now.

That's why they said "a max of". 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:38:51
Not exactly what I was asking, but okay. I got other good answers already. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:36:38
It's dropping. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:30:13
That's what I'm kinda doing now too, but I also wanna buy more now because if BTC crushes B2X when it forks, I think it will just keep shooting higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:24:44
BCH, not BCC. Two different things. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:43:52
Nooooo, Japan is usually way far behind and has trouble changing, so this is a breath of fresh air. We still use fax machines here! So many things make me go crazy here on a daily basis when they use outdated technologies/techniques and when I ask why the answer is always "it's always been like that so that's the way we do it."

Just print them off some paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:20:06
Yeah I know it isn't viable yet, I was just curious if anyone had any insight into how it *could* be done, or maybe how some of the developers have envisioned it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:37:58


If you're hodling, then you haven't made anything back yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:52
Well you can't set up an automatic payment to a key that doesn't exist yet, so you either do it after they open card, or give them a paper wallet with instructions how to transfer it to the app. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:57:57
Yah I get what you're saying, but I just personally think B2X will be worth something to make it worthwhile. Even if it isn't, I believe buying before is better either way.
If BTC crushes B2X, then I think will shoot up even more. 
If B2X actually competes with BTC, then your B2X will actually have value. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:45:31
It's already climbing again.

The Asian markets account for more than half the bitcoin volume in the world.

EDIT: Or maybe not actually. Another site says the opposite. IDK what is true now... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:22:26
Why? America only accounts for 25% of the world's bitcoin volume.
Japan alone accounts for more than 60%. 
Anyway, you guys are missing the point. He was asking why people are saying it is over 10k, so I was giving some possible reasons. (It's mostly because it's over 10k on coinmarketcap.com)
I personally don't think it is over 10k until bitcoinity (weighted average) says that it is. 
EDIT: Now I'm really confused. Another site I looked at said the exact opposite, that the U.S. has 60% of the volume. I don't know what to believe... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:12:36

Ah okay, that makes sense the electronic stores would be the first to adapt (Just realized Bic Camera is where OP took the picture).

This is also totally different than a ban. Just because they weren't an official transport of the airport, doesn't mean they were banned. 
The article says nothing about any greyed out zone either.

No. It is a meme from a bitcoin forum.

With lightning you won't be able to see a public addresses transactions?

Do we really need a post like this at least once a week?

The Internet.

Holy shit, that happened almost instantaneously. Almost at $5900 now.

You just mixed up billion with trillion. Might want to start there... 
21million * 11,000 is 231billion
250trillion / 21million is more than 11million per coin.

Sorry, just sold out. Check your local library.

If you believe in Bitcoin, then why would you be planning to cash out? 
If you truly believe in Bitcoin, you'd realize there will never be a need to "cash out".

Did you seriously just make a new account just to comment that?

Well they can't set fire to your mind wallet.
Oh wait...

They don't and can't. You only owe taxes on capital gains if you profited from trading.

good bot 
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:33:30
No, that makes the value $11,000,000 per coin based on your analogy.

Did you scroll through the thread to find it? You could've just clicked on OP's name...

That isn't true at all. I live in Japan and know foreigners who have gotten citizenship. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:54:45
Just googled it and can't find any info on that ban. Have a source? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:35:29
I live in Japan and use bitflyer. You'll need a Japanese bank account in order to get confirmed and everything on their page though. After that, it's super easy. I charge my account at Lawson.

Okay, the post itself was already enough of an ad. This comment is pushing it. I'm surprised it didn't get picked up by my ad blocker.
