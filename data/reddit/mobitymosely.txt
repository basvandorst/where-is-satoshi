Is your Bitcoin amount available to convert into dollars within the Fidelity account? Or is it just showing you the contents of a Coinbase account?

Somehow only Bitcoin investors know about the "too much debt" problem? I'm trying to make evidence-based, rational decisions. What exact numbers do they see, that's cause for their alarm? And why is nobody else who trades any other financial asset concerned about this information?

What crash are you saying is actually going to happen, and over what time frame?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:47:17
you are using a linear scale. Consistent percentage gains will look deceptively parabolic. You should always use a log scale when graphing investments. [Here's one.](

The public value of tech stocks in the 90's ([the NASDAQ]( grew from around $2 trillion to $9 trillion in market cap over five years before that bubble burst, going back down to $2 trillion (now back up to $9 trillion 15 years later). That was basically the birth of the "internet" as part of the mainstream economy.
There's value in a decentralized currency, but I don't see a clear path where it could supplant the U.S. dollar, which is around $14 trillion in M2 supply, especially that quickly. Otherwise that would mean the commercialization of the very information economy itself, the market value of all those productive companies in the NASDAQ, would be smaller than just one of the multitude of technologies it gave birth to!

Right, shocks don't happen *because* an asset has gone up too long. But the longer an asset does go up, the more it attracts speculators and people giving in to FOMO, tracking error, even career risk. That makes the price more fragile--it takes a smaller shock to cause a healthy correction.

I don't know the answer! What portion of Bitcoin's market cap ($160 billion) is fair value vs. speculative mania and will disappear when the current bubble pops?
How to value a currency? There are no profits/earnings associated with a currency. With Bitcoin it's sort of a proxy for the profits of associated businesses with real-world Bitcoin applications. But those businesses likely aren't worth anywhere near Bitcoin's market cap.
Without an underlying value (like the U.S. dollar, or gold), the only reason to expect Bitcoin to appreciate more is if more people want it in the future than now. And right now that's probably primarily driven by mania, with a smaller component involved in actual use cases.
If you are betting on profiting from the speculative mania portion, how will you know when it's *"doubled enough"* and the next crash is time to get out? How far will it have to rise or fall for you to decide it's been enough?
Basically, it's down to luck--a recipe for disaster for most people involved except the lucky few who jump off while the carousel is still going!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:07:54
That's fair to say. But that doesn't decrease the chance of a crash at any moment in time. Those disruptive events can't be predicted.

Not many people are discussing this topic! 
If you are trying to get out at the same time as everyone else stampeding, you'll probably lose out. The market will already be down so much you could be better off HODLing. 
Once selling pressure from the herd subsides, the price will likely rebound a bit as people second-guess their decision. 
However there is actual momentum in prices. You could try jumping in and out using systematic rules like a weekly or monthly moving average. In the stock market, research shows this reduces risk but also often reduces returns. It actually doesn't matter exactly which moving average you use (though longer ones are slightly better). You will get whipsawed a lot with all of them. 
Have you made a plan yet? You have to decide beforehand, or else your emotions will decide for you when the time comes. I don't have a good answer, but I would consider a moving average because it has clear exit and re-entry points, unlike stop loss strategies.

First of all, I have to commend someone for finally diversifying their assets. Bitcoin could easily have crashed another 85% any time! That type of risk is much higher than the stock market.
I haven't seen anyone mention this, though... for someone comfortable enough with risk to own that much Bitcoin, another option would be to cash out 80% and put half or so of that into a balanced stock/bond fund (e.g. Vanguard Wellington or Global Wellington) rather than fully paying off your house loan. 
Why? A home loan today, with points, is as low as 3.5%/year. Inflation is 2%/year. **So with a home as collateral, you basically are able to pay 1.5%/year to have access to 200K or however big your loan is.**
The U.S. stock market is by no means risk free (has negative return every 3 or 4 years on average, and can drop 50%+), but for long term money (5-10 years), a steady investor could do worse than buy a low-fee balanced fund like Wellington. It's been around since 1929, has 35% in bonds, and has returned 8%/year since then on average.

There could be a small component to that in Bitcoin's price. But people use the "too much debt argument" for a lot of things—the next recession, runaway inflation, the collapse of the dollar and hence our government, etc. It's bad, but few people actually look at the data to say: how much is too much? What dominos show the unwinding? **Macro imbalances take decades to play out. If some effect is happening right now, it would be visible in economic data.**
If debt size has suddenly become so large as to cause Bitcoin's rise from 2016 to today, why is it not affecting the slew of other assets that are more sensitive to debt? For instance, the price of the USD vs gold or other currencies, the level of long term interest rates, credit spreads, etc. etc... these all move when the dollar is getting debased. But that isn't happening.

LOL! Over what time frame?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:28
Nice analogy in the form of Monty Python. Care to talk in actual specifics?
We've seen Greece collapse under a debt that's 200% of their GDP, as well as many South American countries, etc. If an economy stalls and taxes are cut and spending goes up, and debt as a percentage of GDP gets too high, faith in a currency disappears and inflation goes crazy. But if you check those other countries, the U.S. is not even close yet. I'm not saying it can't/won't happen... but have you bothered to check? I believe we are at something like 75% of GDP in debt. If you extrapolate our trajectory, a collapse could maybe happen in the next 30 years or so.
When does your foresight tell us the dollar will collapse, and Bitcoin will save the few "believers" who share your vague intuition? Plus or minus a couple years?
It seems you would rather avoid going on record on Reddit.

To withdraw 37.5K/year, you need enough money invested to not deplete it over a 20-30 year retirement. For a typical retiree hoping to live off stocks, it's generally assumed they can withdraw almost 4%/year, if they're in a safe mix of about 60% stocks and 40% bonds. So to get 37.5K/year with conventional investments, you would need about $1,000,000. (This ignores what 37.5K is actually worth in the future, after inflation.)
If you want to do this by re-entering the market at a lower price, to get at least part of your savings in Bitcoin, **you have to be right about a big list of assumptions:**
1. We are in a cryptocurrency bubble right now which will pop and fall 80%+ (not unlikley but not forgone), giving you a new buying opportunity.
2. You will NOT buy any more Bitcoin now or in the next X years as the price doubles Y times before it pops (psychologically very hard for humans).
3. You will know when it pops and finishes going down and will buy in close to the bottom (hard to impossible, given a century of data on stock market timing behavior).
4. You'll know what cryptocurrency to buy (whether it's Bitcoin or another crypto).
5. After it pops, it will not die and will again double many times.
6. If Bitcoin hits mainstream, at some level we don't know, it will no longer appreciate at a rate higher than inflation. For instance, gold goes up in value about as much as inflation (with huge volatility, similar to the stock market, making it a bad investment).
The end lesson is always the same, if you want to speculate on Bitcoin:
+ Dollar-cost average into it like you did
+ HODL it!
+ Only hold an amount you can afford to lose without panicking, like a stock market investment. (So good thing you sold, if you wanted it to pay off your house).
+ Diversify into some global stocks and bonds too, in case your crypto does go down 95%.

"Just watch, in the next couple decades, you'll see I'm right!" Okay, I'm going to need a lot of popcorn...

Have you looked at a historical chart of Bitcoin's performance? It's never doubled that many times in a row without a crash, yet.
+ [Historical chart of Bitcoin's performance]( (make sure to use log scale) 
+ [A better historical chart but only back to 2012](
Not saying it can't happen, but it might take a whole lot more than just hope!

I have no interest in doing your work for you, to find the one time you've given a timeframe for a dollar collapse.
The internet is full of people making vague predictions of apocalypse and conspiracies. But try to get specific evidence for beliefs from someone, and they disappear to another thread.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:47:45
How so? I am not sure I will get much information from your vague statements. Any government that is responsible with its currency, e.g. running budget surpluses, is also a solution to the problem of the U.S. having too much debt.

For sure, there's no lack of healthy momentum if you look at Bitcoin's price. It's has Tesla level acceleration, not out-of-control SpaceX-level like it did twice in 2013. Also, [from 2011-2013 it doubled six times]( before that bubble crashed. From its most recent $200 low, it hasn't quite doubled six times again (that would take us to $12,800).
However most any other [asset price bubble in history]( can be spotted somewhat by double-checking the valuation of the underlying assets. It's clear that 90% of Bitcoin's valuation is speculative potential (and ensuing mania) rather than the value of any currently implemented solutions.
For instance, during the dot-com bubble of 1995-2000, internet and e-commerce companies increased in value by 5x (doubled 2.25 times). Despite calls of a "new economy," the underlying model for determining a company's value did *not* change. As a result, the NASDAQ fell 80%, back to its valuation before the bubble, and took 15 years to grow organically back to its highest valuation.
The whole information economy (judging by the NASDAQ's market cap) is now worth about $13 trillion. How much of that pie should Bitcoin be worth? (It's currently at $160 billion) 
The entire U.S. dollar M2 money supply is about $14 trillion. For those of us who follow Warren Buffett and agree that no one has made money betting against the U.S. economy, it may be a long time before any other world currency, digital or otherwise, supplants the dollar.
The current "market cap" of all mined gold is about $7 trillion. This does suggest another store of value could rise to eclipse it. But if you want a hard currency that can survive an apocalypse or government collapse, and attracts the type of investor who buys gold, a digital/electronically-based currency does not seem a likely candidate.
**None of this says that cryptocurrencies' $300 billion market cap can't double a few more times. But there are hard ceilings in the global economy, and manias tend to get far ahead of their eventual equilibrium values.**

So somehow the slow unwinding of mortgage loans, is such a dark cloud, that a few people just last year and this year decided they must hoard Bitcoin, despite the reckoning probably not causing any actual crashes and being decades away??
I guess that is the tenuous logic I should've expected from carrying this discussion to its conclusion.
