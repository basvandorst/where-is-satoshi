I could argue that the crisis of deflation is good as well.  The reason being the cause of the deflation.  The great depression was caused by the "roaring twenties" and things needed to get back to normal.  They never let that happen (laissez faire) and we got the New Deal, all the wars and this nanny state we live in today.  So the depression was necessary to return to normalcy.  Do people lose jobs?  Do businesses close?  Are times harder?  Answer to all is yes but then new ideas emerge and all the fat cats have leaned out or been removed.  That's not allowed to happen anymore.  We have this heroin economy and they keep pumping and pumping.  It's slowly starting to unravel now.

classic example of this is a 1964 quarter.  It is worth approximately 4.00 today which buys a gallon of gas.  That same quarter in 1964 bought a gallon of gas at 25 cents.  The 1965 quarter also bought a gallon of gas in 1965.  Today that 1965 quarter buys 25 cents of gas because it isn't silver.  There is no store of value in today's money, just empty promises.  I am a gold bug here who also believes in bitcoin/crypto.  The paper era of money (fiat) is ending.  Bitcoin in helping that along (bigly).

I don't understand some of the complaints on this board so hopefully someone can give me some clarity.

If BCH is so much inferior than bitcoin wouldn't this have just created another buying opportunity?  TIA GLTA HODL

There have always been better options than fiat.  That's why it's fiat.  If there were open competiton for money paper money would've lost a long time ago.  Governments will make crypto illegal if they want and make it very hard to be accepted anywhere.  On the flip side, I agree that the dollar and other paper currencies are on their way out.  They're in a race to the bottom.  Got bitcoin?   Got gold?

In the paper markets the dollar is kicking everybody's butt, I agree.  I think this is going on behind the scenes.  The stronger the dollar gets the worse it is now for the U.S.  So now everybody is coming up with a strategy to fight the strength of the dollar.  Gold reserves are being stockpiled (don't take my word you can google that) and in poor countries the dollar is not the currency of choice anymore (bitcoin is).  I own both gold and bitcoin/crypto.  It's just my humble opinion.  This all gets to play out on the world stage.

At some point there will probably be a big shift.  It's happening slower than I thought over the last ~20 years.  In most countries they usually "revalue" their currency and that is a big shift in consciousness for people.  Something like that could happen in the next 5-6 years.  I'm not good at predicting that type of stuff.  I think where this is eventually going is the important thing to keep in mind.

They are trading in yuan and roubles.  However they are both buying massive amounts of gold every month.  Turkey is as well and other countries are coming aboard also.  The world is moving away from dollars and paper.  I believe Russia and China are allowing their currency to be convertible to gold with each other.  The BRICS countries have explored gold backed trade.  It's not official yet.  The process has started already.

I think you are underestimating the store of value of bitcoin.  The world is poor but even poor people around the world have savings.  They just don't have anything to save with.  Their local currency doesn't have value (Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey etc..).  If you can save something with a store of value you can begin a process of acquiring wealth.  I think bitcoin can be both a store of value and a medium of exchange (good for saving and spending).

In the West gold can be used to make jewelry (usually 14 or 18k).  In other cultures the jewelry is savings (usually 22 or 24k).   Just because people buy jewelry that's not worth anything doesn't mean gold isn't money.  It isn't a currency, it's money.  The dollar is a currency but isn't money (it isn't a store of value).

Gold standard is sustainable.  Governments and banks don't want it so you don't get it.   Why can't you borrow on a gold standard?  You can but people only borrow for worthy causes you are borrowing against value.  Who cares when it comes to paper, it's all worthless.  The expansion of the U.S., especially after 70's (Nixon) has been credit driven and the bill is coming due.  You are reporting the final score of the game when we are only in the 6th or 7th inning.

In a functioning economy savings can be productive.  When prices are high it is prudent to save allowing prices to drop and then investment can return.  That's what happens with a real economy and sound money.  With this inflationary nightmare, your money isn't your money.  It will be inflated, taxed and confiscated.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:04:33
Recession and even a depression are a normal part of a healthy economy with real money (gold).   If you are hoarding during a time when it would be smart to expand you would lose out.  People borrow and economies expand on the gold standard.  People and companies go bankrupt on the gold standard.  Guess what, when companies go bankrupt new ones eventually take their place.  With this paper money B.S. you have all these zombie companies that don't make any money and have their hands in the taxpayer's pockets.   This doesn't end well.  Gold and silver was just fine.   It's just doesn't work if a country wants to keep going to war.  War is very expensive.  Inflation hides the cost.  Joe 6-Pack and Connie Cosmopolitan don't understand the 5 or 6 dollars a pint for blueberries are the result of paying for endless wars and unlimited immigration.  The debt is piling up.  Prices have to keep going up because the money is worth less and less. Admitted Gold Bug here and for the past few years a crypto bug too (mostly bitcoin and litecoin)

Partially true.  Inlationary currency is always bad because it destroys incentives to save.  Savings is a part of healthy economy.  When prices rise people save and when prices fall they spend.  There is a natural process to it.  We don't live in a healthy economy.  The currency is failing as is society as a whole.  People are slowly starting to understand there is an unraveling happening.
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:27:22
I think you are ignoring the historical use of gold and paper money.  Just like I don't believe bitcoin will be a good use for small transactions (maybe litecoin or even dogecoin), it will be very good for a store of value (one important aspect of money).  Silver is better for day to day uses.  I think the jewelry talk is explained in history.  I prefer to not go into it but you can read about jewelry in China and especially India to understand that.  Forget about the U.S., people don't understand history (money).

I wasn't trying to be nice, just honest.  I wouldn't buy jewelry unless it as 22 or 24k.  I believe in gold.  I'm saying gold is money and dollars are currency.  Euro is currency too but not as strong since U.S. has bigger guns.  The guy with the bigger guns/balls wins.  It's not a nice concept.  Who buys jewelry that doesn't have gold, silver, platinum, diamonds etc.....?   I think the answer would be poor people, dumb people, shopping addicts (QVC), bored people etc.....

You underestimate the power of "The State".  When they want to smash bitcoin or other cryptos, they can and they will.  The people with the guns and the balls (winning combo) always win.  The smart people always work for the guns/balls.  It's not the other way around and it never has been.

I don't agree that fiat helped economic development.  It would have happened on the gold standard.  We have to agree to disagree.  I don't agree with the socialist view of money.

Incorrect.  It's supply and demand.  The price would rise to what would be the agreed on price between buyer and seller.  I might not want to sell my bitcoin at double the price.

I am a gold bug.  There are times when economic output is growing and a time when it is contracting.  Savings and investment are both important.  In theory, savings is used for lending.  It's part of wealth which is acquired through labor, knowledge etc..   Are you against a person having the ability to be wealthy and free?   I am involved in crytpo (bitcoin and litecoin primarily) based on the monetary aspect.  I don't believe in paper money.
