CW, You are probably right. If I had invested in Twitter, Tumblr, and Kickstarter, I would be happy to think you would also consider me to be extremely highly influential. However, I love Andreas Antonopoulos as much as the next man, but you must admit he did tell us two weeks ago (and with utter certainly) that Mt. Gox was not insolvent. I hope he is right. I salute your faith in Fred Wilson, and his senatorial correspondence .

Well I'm not sure of the OP's motives here, but I do think this is a strong motivation for promoting Bitcoin as a protocol rather than as a currency. This way it's adoption is focused on small businesses rather than individuals.  This, ISTM, is precisely why the Internet won out over AOL  and CompuServe.

This is a good idea, but I do think we must get farther ahead of the game than this. A petition of a few hundred thousand names collected over a few months is going to be pretty easy to ignore when compared to a a few hundred thousand dollars of campaign contributions. As I say,this is a good idea, but we probably need to be a little more calculating when it comes to issues like this.

I congratulate you for calling me on that point, you ask a very good question. I am sure we are way behind the curve here. Appealing to politicians in exactly the same way everyone else does will have no effect. We do need to come up with something better. I don't know what, but if we are going to bombard a Senator with email is beyond us to send him 100,000 emails on the same day? Not subtle, but at least that would be different.

I think the clean distro + bitaddress is a really good idea.

@_date: 2013-12-17 06:02:56
I think you are right, there will be a fight, and it may be ugly, but in the end they will lose, (a, because one of them will cut and run, and (b, the commercial pressure will be too much in the end. I also doubt that the government will protect them much because of the pressure from Silicon Valley,  and because they did that in 2008 and they know we are all fucked off with all of them bigtime. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:55:20
Hay elan, I'm Sorry if my silliness has in any way offended you. Gambling and depression are two of the worst conditions I can think of. And, I agree, anyone who can function at all with these conditions must be a great person. I truly hope things work out for you, your father and your family in general. However, there is one really striking issue your message presents: You know that this whole Bitcoin thing is a really risky deal. Some might even describe it as a bit of a casino. It all looks great at the moment, but there a hundred of things that could kill it off your 5 BTC in an instant. Personally think things could well work out, but bad things can happen. For instance, you might like to look into the way FDR forced every American to sell their gold in 1933. It a pretty chilling story and although it probably less likely to happen today, it is perhaps a good example of how seriously the US takes the use of money in society.  So be good, have fun, but please don’t get sucked into the casino too much yourself. And don’t get succored in by old farts like me who like to brag about the number of BTC they want to buy. I only want to buy what I can afford to lose. Anyway, I must go, and BTW I only have 1 BTC at the moment and so you are actually 5 times richer than me! Ha!

Dear boy---Please!---you have nothing whatsoever to apologize for! Because you are completely right: I have done precious little diligence. But in my defense, I am really only into BTC for a little fun, and I have a wife!---a wife who has been egging me on---her precise words were, “Henry, you don’t go into a brothel only to ask for a kiss!; send them $10,000 and let’s see precisely what is what.”  My day-to-day life offers little defense; her father warned me at the wedding: “Henry, I hope you know the kind of creature you are marrying: Alice is the sort of woman who could break a swan’s wing with a blow of her nose!” So I hope you see that I’m not exactly what you might call a free agent in this affair.
I did sniff about a little for a good entry into BTC, and found a fair number of people who spoke quite well of CampBX. I guess I was seduced by their low cost and slick web site. And I have not heard of any serious fraud, so that’s why I did what I did. I have also failed to find reference to the coinbase problem which prompted me to make my posing. When I Googled the error message I only got one hit, and that was not exactly related. I only know about Google and Reddit and Facebook (but I am religiously opposed to FB), so if you know of a good source of information, I'd love too know. 
Thanks also for you for your kind wishes; may your transactions be fruitful and your digital wallet ever secure.

@_date: 2013-12-20 21:40:56
Thanks for your explanation lx,  so the miners regulate the rate of Bitcoin production? The thing I don't quite get is that the "difficulty" seems to go up exponentially. Every so often the number of zero bits that must be found in a SHA256 hash is incremented, thus making it twice as difficult. This, I think is what prompted the 2020 date as being the time when there would be 18 million BTC mined, but so many zeros that given the power of the hardware available everyone would give up mining as unprofitable. What I can't see is how the task can suddenly be made less difficult given that all the hashes with fewer zeros will have been mined already. Thanks...

I think these ideas are really interesting. Being a bear of little brain, I have no predictions of my own (other than than the fear that something like executive order 6102 might occur). Actually, although the world may not know it yet, I suspect the thing may be beyond any one nation's control. The thing that intrigues me is that some basket-case economy in Africa might who has adopted the BTC because the local currency is worthless will end up with a population of millionaires.

@_date: 2013-12-21 23:25:14
Hey, Thanks again. Okay, so its interesting how your calculation for 2020 seems to match quite closely. 
But I there is still something I don't quite get (and please just point me somewhere I should go and read, if it is easier). I can see that the miners all agree to regulate the rate of Bitcoin production, but how can they reduce the difficulty level if, as I said before (and possible incorrectly), the difficulty is increased when an extra zero goes on to the SHA256 that needs to be calculated?  I assume that this only happens when all the easier hashes are mined, which would imply one cannot go back.  
As for wishing I'll just be happy if I can say I made a good move at the end of 2013 by buying a few coins. A friend of mine put a load of dough into SecondMarket when BTC was pretty high, and is now a bit queasy about it. But in a year when it might easily be 2/3K or more I think he will be quite pleased.

Err, i'm sure I didn't repost, so I don't quite understand. But, I agree, in general, some interesting thing could happen in Cyprus, and this outfit Neo &amp; Bee seem  to be trying to build a comprehensive BTC infrastructure there. If they succeed it will be really interesting and I can imagine all sorts of new industries starting up there. It will also be interesting to see what the reaction of the EU will be if they default on their Euro debt, and get rich on BTC growth.

Interesting comment nim. If we were a world of communists (which thankfully we are not) I guess we would all get a little under 0.03 BTC each.

Thanks so much for that link. It almost sounds like a sage worthy of Kurosawa. The thing that worries me most about this whole BTC thing is, strangely perhaps, the way FDR forced the US to hand over its gold in 1933. The US definitely does not like anyone messing with its money. It sounds to me that if we want to call ourselves capitalists we should support the guy on the blue bouncing ball. Actually, it sounds like a good rule in general: if you work on one of those large blue balls,  you strengthen your back, an a strong back is probably a good thing in this business. Thanks again, I think this is a guy we should support. (But I know nothing.)

If you want to operate in the UK I'd get a new web site name. Its start with "gob" which is slang for mouth in the UK. On initial decoding the whole domain name looks a little like it may be leading to "gobshite" (which hopefully I don't need to explain). Anyway the "go" just looks like you were too slow of the mark to get bitstripe.com. (Not that this would had been that much better in the UK as kind of refers to shredded cow stomach.)

Hey, The thing to get is this might go like Google, or it might bomb big time. I’m about 50/50. But nobody knows, and you could well lose everything. This is the key issue: Put in only what you can happily laugh off losing. For me this is about 10K, but I am 55, with a decent 401K, a paid-off house, &amp; etc. You may think the risks a minimal, and I hope you are right. But let me let me challenge you a little, do you think Americans might ever be forced to ever give up their legally held gold reserves to the government? Check out Executive Order 6102. Personally I doubt this would happen these days, but there are many other things like this that might occur. Please don’t think we are playing in a simple, risk-free market. My advice is: be young while you can (which is probably a lot shorter than you think), have fun, be happy and don’t listen to old farts like me!   
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:00:07
I was wondering that too. The main reason i thought it might be a bug is when I Googled the error mess age (which is "Please wait until your first bitcoin purchase completes before making additional purchases.(Once your first purchase completes you can make multiple purchases at the same time.)") there seems only one real hit from Mar 30, 2013:  The sender talks about having bought a coin successfully. I'm not exactly sure what this means; I've bought one coin successfully and I can see that Coinbase has been paid for it. The thing I really don't get is that if they are going to prevent me from trading (by keeping transaction pending) why are they preventing me from buying more. After all they are both being paid and keeping hold of the product. What exactly is the point of this I wonder? After all they know who am,  and indeed have their very hands on the genitals of my bank account!
