Any other reason other than 10K/bitcoin ofcourse...
How blind can people be hmm
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:11:45
I mean the OP is also moving it "within" BTC only lul
If he converted it to something else he would get rekt in fees
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:16:46
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:08:08
Irrelevant when the exchange just wants to fuck you up
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:08:11
Would stabilize around 7k~~ anyways
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:01:56
I like how you say "just" lmao
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:06:20
MindConnect would be a thing some day
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:01:00
stfu retard
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:03:54
Logic =\= This sub.
Fees are high because 
a) We have 1 MB blocks.
b) Let's say we can do 100 transactions per block.
c) But there are a 1000 people transacting.
d) People want to be in that 100 transaction and hence pay higher fees than 900 others.
e) Low fee transactions are irrelevant because they are almost never included in those 100transactions in the first place.
Tldr; you aren't competing with low fee users. You are competing with the top 100.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:06:31
Its not bulletproof.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:45:22
Its one thing to set up a wrong stop loss. 
Its ~~another thing~~ retarded to not have a stop loss at all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:07:14
Exchanges trading on itself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:15
Fuck Coinbase, Fuck Bitpay, Fuck Steam.
Fuck everyone who helped Bitcoin become what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:19:05
So... How is tether fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:20:03
I mean the fees were never this high. Ever.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:27:36
Can't make a loss if it only goes up through an entire year
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:36:47
For bch yes.
For bitcoin, difficulty changes after *144* blocks ...
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:56:23
Don't do stop loss??
Lul this sub gone full retard.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:27:29
Exchanges are the new banks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:13:57
So 30$ fees of 30cent fees. Hmmm.
Clearly 30cents is more.
Quick maffs op.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:47:58
With relevant resources; even I.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:58:43
B...but Hodling
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:13
People realize Segwit is OPTIONAL?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:53:07
Yes we must kick the miners from the ecosystem.
Clearly spam attacks.
Maybe our lord and saviours core team could put a minimum and maximum fee if they dare?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:23:48
Well they don't claim its the same because its different.
It still is Bitcoin in every semantic and technical way.
BTC was meant to be forked as many times as needed.
There's no "dividing" the community because people will always vote with their wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:05:27
Many sites still need shit loads of verification
Plus most mainstream sites deal with few countries only.
The smaller ones are bugged, shit ui, slow etc.
So for the majority of the world, selling off is difficult. (Though they don't also have much btc in the first place)
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:53:52
Logic in r/bitcoin? Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:50:28
2017 and Valve?
GoodShit m8
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:33:33
I mean the entire post is disinfo/misleading lul
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:02:38
If you don't own your keys you don't own your btc.
Insured? Lmao.
In case of a hack/price crash /site getting fucked, you won't be seeing anyone from there ever. Goodluck getting your btc back.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:06:40
Has btc ever done the same rise as it did for the last 12 months? Literally grew exponentially.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:27:35
"a transaction" is an understatement.
Anyways I could also go shoot most of the large pool owners so...
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:09:52
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:58:52
And store too. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:57:03
Wow miners are so smart!
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:18:14
Do libgen man
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:15:02
Because while you can its not really *that* easy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:35:28
Because technically mines could stop mining Bitcoins. And kill the coin.
Price should be 0$ amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:48:09
Well Bitcoin is the one losing adoption rather fast...
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:15:43
Still a fork...
Which means starting anew
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:12:09


@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:56
Because they are doing nothing? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:06:07
Yes, one of the points for btc was to make sure that doesn't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:14:20
Usually both.
Can reach the tree easy if there are stairs already.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:56:19
Then create your coin
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:45:22
Delusions are real.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:03:00
Its backed by nothing
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:37:13
Hardware wallet like Electrum are fine with entry level amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:14:30
Except where the fuck is LN? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:55:30
Yes we must mine with Dual cores to only mine the low fees transactions to stop this attack from bcash
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:09:01
That was the point!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:28:29
Won't go through unless lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:55:11
If Bitcoin was a trademark we wouldn't be here :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:32:01
Your computer is still a hardware though.
Trezor like wallets should be called external wallets maybe :thinking:
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:06
Or he means Bitcoin will die :S
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:16:20
But wait, you are actually paying for everything with tendies you ate!
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:09:24
Buy 50$ and spend 20$ in fees. Goodluck.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:02:00
They won't last yes.
They will increase instead to 50$.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:58
Anime characters look nothing like Asians, or white people for that instance. 
Fucking retard.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:39
a) because it *is* a *Bitcoin* fork. And its childish not to call someone their given name. Bitcoin Cash is what they chose.
b) I mean it is also cheaper to transact in their coin. There can be a 100 Bitcoins if that's what needed. Core repeatedly failed to address concerns of a significant part of the community. Hence it split. Infact bch would have probably died if core went 2x.
c) Goodluck with that thinking :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:05:53
Sounds way too much like a ponzi hmmmm
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:56:18
No solution to it
Mining tech will only only go faster and more expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:14:46
So the card converts btc into fiat "instantly" and you think you are using btc?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:23
Which means the mempool drooped those transactions
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:09
Only when btc drops to 7k
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:39:51
For entry level its fine.
No one is hunting you exclusively.
Of course with increase in holdings you want to upgrade security.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:58:14
If you keep your eyes closed people can't call you blind ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:53:43
"I have tens of thousands of old coins in donations."
Thanks for listening.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:53:54
Same applies to Bitcoin....
Not enough miners = Dead coin
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:11:12
51% attack will be the easiest.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:14:13
Good stuff knowing how many old holders are here lul.
Actually yes you can still cashout as long as fees&lt;tip. Or you can choose a donation.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:52:36
a) ofourse you can. And people will trade for it. That's the entire point of open source.
b) doge isn't bitcoin though.
c)  every coin is miner "manipulated". Its called consensus.
Roadmap? Lighting fork has been " incoming" for two years now. Nice roadmap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:01:38
So where do old transactions go?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:23:46
High fees aren't rising because of anyone except the user.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:01:18
Lol ltc and bitcoin are effectively the same? But the coin literally sharing the same ledger and base tech is not?
It would be called confusing people if one wasn't priced 2k and one 20k...
Unless you are implying the people in general are stupid enough to not being able to differentiate?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:33:59


Just like Bitcoin and bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:34:19
And where will they go after btc dies? Lmao.
Bch is exit game.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:28:09
For me ? No.
For a bank or a country? Easy as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:57:20
Tldr; OP wants you to hodl the fort so that he can exit in peace.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:55:13
The leadership of a "decentralised" coin changed.
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:30:53
Except two years before this point, this isn't what Bitcoin was sold as.
The idea always was to use it as actual currency and not become actual gold for fucks sake.
Only shows how much the original idea has been hijacked just as it attracted major support.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:09:01


When it was 10$ per btc maybe then lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:11:33
Their code is still the same lmao.
You can fork bitcoin a hundred times and it still is Bitcoin x
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:44:37
ATM didn't charge much.
Bitcoin network charged you for 17ish $
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:10:28
Well you described this sub actually. Except this one's larger and more hostile.
Ironically tipping which was a large part of bitcoin culture back then is now impossible due to fees :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:41:03
bch is going up lmao
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:59:51
What would be sacrificed?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:11
Except since btc+bch holds at 7.xish means there is not much new money.
All the activity is just money moving within the system.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:23:13
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:54:18
Other than Hodl what real world applications?
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:12:49
LUL 1337 haxor
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:16:14
Your mistake was using bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:27:10
Paypal has shutload of fees outside murica.
And yet ironically was looking to move 60$ and btc charges me more than Paypal so kek
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:56:56
Op could just use a VPN and claim haxors?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:52:39
Can you reach top3 market cap?
Then fuck yes lol.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:42:48
Tbh house prices at his retirement will be much higher then it is now...
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:33:06
Go with 20$ .
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:50:05
They always do. But for this one atleast ; its whales vs whales.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:25
For this sub 2x was an attack too lul
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:44:12
Atleast they aren't directly aggressive towards anyone who doesn't agree
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:54:55
At the moment, the only way to win is not use bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash is what you want for anything &lt;500$
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:51:42
So this sub now supports that a exchange controls what they do with people's money?
Who does that? Banks. Why was bitcoin created? Oh wait.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:58:21
I am quite sure They**s has far more money power then any mod there.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:39:15
Its not really a currency anymore when HODL is the meme mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:04:48
Well if crypto &gt; USD someday you can bet your ass different countries will try to grab a coin for themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:42:52
A currency where people advice you not to spend hmm
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:48
Or maybe because s2x was cancelled without the market ever getting its chance to show consensus and this is just the back fire.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:43:14
If you said Satoshi atleast it was some logic...
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:07:56
Fees is high
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:54:46
Which is only natural depending on what people can lose out on and what time frame they are invested for.
If they have a 3 month portfolio I doubt its gonna touch 7k anytime soon for now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:12:14
Yup he's a 2011 guy.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:50:03
How is everything termed as an "attack" by this sub wtf
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:14:09
Wait more
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:43:23
Speed matters exactly because its not an app. Its in the headlines with everyone following its every step eagerly. Which is why it can't take its time.
Of course its far from a crash, but a point will come when it just has to show or fall down the drain. Just hope btc is ready that day.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:16:30
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:59:21
So nothing revolutionary?
Since that fees argument falls apart
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:06:09
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:03:59
The only person it costs money is you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:37:18
Actually they can't even tip you a cigarette. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:34:58
What's wrong with bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:14:53
Yup. If he sells 15k  the other 10k sells on trash prices /:bcash gets so high he doesnt get most of it.
I feel like this is either the last of his hoard. (Since he should have brought bch at much lower prices, or he is not gonna sell this stack due the huge loss he has to face?)
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:03:15
And eth *is* used.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:49:44
Market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:13:55
We Scientology now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:41:23
But this sub literally told me few days ago transactions were an attack...
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:35:41
It can't be continuous because the so called whales would just eat everyone else within a few rounds...
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:59:48
Too many to be included in a post.
But no one will actually tell if one of them are bound to occur.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:15:34
5$ * 2
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:12
It means you have money you can't do shit with.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:15:11
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:53:39
If I knew it why would I tell you
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:32:12
Except not everyone is moving 50k everyday...
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:26:38
Literally says Bitcoin Cash in three fucking places. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:49:50
If they do then 1x is rip
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:03:20
There are no bch ATM for now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:16:59
That's what it was until it got taken over.
There's (Bitcoin cash) for your needs nowm
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:36:17
I loved the theoritcal concept tbh. But it has strayed far from what it was , for good or worse.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:03:26
The idea is to buy again instantly. 
Currently on bitcoin you lose 10+$ for one such set.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:15:51
Where do I say its compatible?
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:22:24
Its called bot abuse.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:06:22
lul what?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:11
Because if 2x came out bitcoin would truly be the king
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:27:52
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:54:55
You need loads of money to get every ticket; you need a script to enter every key
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:13:13
