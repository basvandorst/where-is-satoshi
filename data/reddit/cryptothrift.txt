On behalf of cryptothrift and the team, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience and confusion we have caused.
While we do admit that it was an error on our behalf which have led to this post, we would also like to shed some light on the facts and the circumstances surrounding the matter.
First, when a user requests a refund, the only information they require to submit is a **Refund** address and a reason. **yomofos** happened to submit the wrong refund address as per this **[screen shot]( (some info were deleted for the security and privacy of the user).
After investigating the matter, we refunded the amount to the buyer (manually) and an automated email was generated and sent out  (screen shot from post).
The user then sent a new support ticket saying that the funds were sent to the wrong address, we replied advising that the funds were sent to his nominated address 
After our reply, we did not hear anything from the user, this is not unusual as users tend to stop replying to tickets when the issue is resolved. That was on April 12th as per screen shots. We closed the ticket after 48 hours (automated).
On April 20th, we received another request from the user ** (screen shot from post). It happened that Sunday and Monday are Easter weekend, we, the founders, has split the holiday so we could each take a day off to spend with our families, which also led to us falling behind on support tickets and resulted in this mess.
We have already processed this refund and added some extra as an apology for the delay. We try our best to stay on top of our support tickets, but we that some times we fall behind.
Just to shed some light on the business itself and the founders. We're two family men from Sydney, we both have full time jobs and kids, we run the site between our work hours and of course late nights... very late sometimes... We have finished registering the business and we are happy to disclose any personal information, business name, business address with the public. The information isn't live yet on the site as we're looking into getting public liability insurance to have users' funds backed by insurance in case worst comes to worst.
If you have any issues or would like any further info, give us a buzz, we'll do our best to respond with in 24 hours to all requests.
