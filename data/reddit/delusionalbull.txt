In the same way an arbitrarily limited digital token doesn't create value. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:37:44
Not only that but it was going for $45 on that site, it's where I pre-ordered mine.
@_date: 2015-12-15 08:56:13
Changetip is nothing but a decaying corpse at this point.   Oddly enough people really didn't care about collecting a few pennies. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:28:45
Yeah, "free-speech".
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:58:52
Adblock has been garbage for quite awhile now.  Most people have migrated over to Ublock origin.
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:29:28
No shit.   That's why you all are quick to mash the ban button at the first whiff of it. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:09:22
No your infantile understanding of even the most basic aspects of money is at best laughable. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 08:59:56
You are why this exists. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:12:11
Yeah, God forbid the customer gets their product in a timely manner and in usable condition.  They should be thanking these companies for the privilege of paying a premium to help run the companies test bed.

People brag about how Bitcoin is about to hit a 6 billion market cap but if you look at stuff like pinterest which came out in 2010 and had a market valuation of over 6 billion by 2012.  Shows just how small bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:20:46
Yeah 80% seems a bit low. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 03:01:08
Compulsive gambling is a huge problem? 
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:55:10
Couldn't you just buy one of those $10 androids at Wal-Mart and use that as a  display?
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:29:23
Yeah dude seven years and just starting. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:48:15
So you mean they accept fiat from fold then?  
@_date: 2016-01-02 18:25:54
Law enforcement isn't going to do anything.   
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:35:28
Looks like I was right again. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:12:54
The spam bots have at least.

Let me guess.  We should buy bitcoins now.   He says this like every week. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:24:07
No, because we know the only people that got wealthy are the ones that got in on the ground floor or prey on peoples gambling addictions.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:13:00
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:20:53
No way. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:14:27
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:08:35
Because despite all of the blustering most people are here for one reason only.  To hopefully get rich.   If they were given a choice between becoming personally wealthy and having Bitcoin die because of it or having Bitcoin become mainstream but with no personal gain they would cut Bitcoin's balls off without a second thought. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:41:37
So if the coins are 400 you would have no problem with them still only giving you your 300?
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:02:45
You could say the same thing about literally anything. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:15:11
If you listen to the companies that have actually tried it then the answer is no. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:54:55
None of this even matters while LN still remains vaporware.  They have been talking about it for years and are no close to implementing anything.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:27:24
Facts U Dislike
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:01:39
Well there are a whopping 9 verified purchase reviews on Amazon right now. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 12:29:22
Someone already did that s few years ago and they actually had to roll back the entire blockchain a couple of days.

The Bitcoin Lightning Network came to life in 2013, when Poon, "like many before him", he says, had the idea for hub and spoke payment channels. Dryja came on board soon after, making scripting and transactions more compact.
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:55:25
This is it.  This is the event that is going to cause a huge wave of adoption by businesses and the general population.  Than you Mike Tyson for all you have done for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:52:30
That's how our government works.   The people elect a small group of representatives to make all the decisions.  Do you really think each and every person in the country is going to vote on every single thing? 
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:51:22
But it isn't a currency.
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:27:51
This is obviously a lie.  if IBM had taken the time to read this forum over the last year they would know that it is inpossible to have a blockchain without our specific token.  These companies need to stop trying to avoid giving us our much deserved payout for hodling all of these years.
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:20:28
7 years of growing pains.
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:37:57
Because Bitcoin is like the internet in 1973.
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:15:29
Impressive it beat out some shitty miners and some old used NAS boxes.
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:46:53
1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:01:28
Of course I am.  How else would I get rich by doing and contributing nothing. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:29:07
Then what is it? 
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:00:08
Time is money
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:31:44
I have this lockbox with a million  dollars in it and I'll sell it to you for 500 bucks. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:23:24
No way.
@_date: 2015-11-10 09:50:16
No one would even notice because nothing would be different. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 09:50:57
AOL still has 2.1 million users. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:34:50
Please do come over and talk. Unlike a certain sub we won't ban posters or delete posts.  Well unless you come over talking about ButtcoinXT. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:38:17
A form of payment that after seven years still is only a hardly noteworthy niche? 
@_date: 2015-11-17 00:55:51
But not from Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:58:00
He might have going in to get a safe deposit box, a loan, or some other service.  How does Bitcoin help with this?
@_date: 2015-10-05 21:22:59
Right but if Apple were to implement this feature why wouldn't they just tinker with Apple Pay instead of trying to integrate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-09 21:59:09
Everything posted in this sub is considered the hottest new thing for Bitcoin and as usual this is just another thing to throw on to the pile of failures.
@_date: 2015-10-06 08:06:56
If you are running a miner on your phone it will drain your battery in no time flat and you would have to recharge so yes it does cost electricity. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 06:40:55
Only in the world of Bitcoin do people celebrate throwing their money at a guy who set his price point to cash out. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:49:50
Well typing Igot.com into the search bar leads to pages of nothing but people saying they were robbed and that it's a scam.   So there's that. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 21:12:46
What's wrong with Apple Pay?
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:29:27
Yes I remember everyone using Cuecat for the huge discounts as well.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:39:00
Downvoted.  Facts don't belong here sir.

Who cares?

Did millionaire get some new definition lately?  Four digits seems a lot lower than seven.

Utorrent has been shit for a few years now. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:04:41
Yeah I'm sure people that block ads for free would all of the sudden want to start paying for the privilege. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:13:02
If you use a linear chart it looks like the right half of the picture.

BoA has 57 million customers.  A high end estimate of Bitcoin users might hit 500k.  BoA also offers a wide variety of services as mentioned by someone else in this thread.  This topic is stupid.

As I said I'm not interested in technicalities.  Just an answer to a choice between outcome A or outcome B.

You mean blockchain.   No one gives a shit about the get rich quick tokens except for the bag holders. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 21:39:50
Uh no you can have an infinite number of different blockchains.   There's nothing stopping anyone from forking and making their own chain with their own tokens.   Are you new to this? 
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:16:26
He hasn't gotten any attention in awhile.
