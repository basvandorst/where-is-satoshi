When do you think it's expected to crash? I don't plan on making tens of thousands of dollars or anything. Maybe a couple hundred dollars I would consider a success

Ok thank you. So with the ledger I can set up one address and send coin from gdax to there multiple times with the same address? And that will be quick and secure?

Is that an app? I'm trying to do everything on Mobil. Thanks

I have the Coinbase app and almost have my account set up. How do the fees work for buying and selling?

Ok thanks!

Ok sweet. Thanks guys

Ok thanks. I don't plan on selling anytime soon. Just looking for a good time to buy

Can someone help me get started with bitcoin? Any good videos or tutorials? I don't know much about investing but I would like to. Thanks!

Lol agreed
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:07:00
Ok thanks everybody. I guess I'll try to buy a little to play around with and start doing some research
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:16:50
I wish

Will I need to have that before I buy bitcoin? Where is bitcoin stored right when I buy from gdax?

What's a good price monitoring site? Does gdax work pretty well for that?
