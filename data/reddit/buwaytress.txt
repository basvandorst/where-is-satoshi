Such heady dreams. Maybe a rebrand to Vitalikcoin is due.

Hope you have time to join the Sep 20 event on Bisq. If all works out, it'll see the highest volume and ads there. If nothing more than to just watch and see.

Well, most discussion panels tend to be all-men. This wasn't deliberate anyway, just pointing out how rare it can seem to find a debate where panelists happen to be made up of under-represented gender.

Indeed! If before, it seemed the only way to even visit a place like Iran was to bring lots of cash, now you can use Bitcoin to get almost anything you need done there.

It'd be cooler if McAfee were rocking a Draper tie. Bitcoin over Barneyhue. Nice.

Yes, it was for his Bachelor's and the guy's doing something up for a postgrad study now. It's why he used a now defunct mixer and hasn't tried one of the newer ones like Chipmixer.

It's Romero, the drugcoin of Mehico.

The full coin means you will have robbed 100 million people of the chance to own 1 satoshi. Do ot.

I did not create it, but the original post is here on Bitcointalk:  [ 
I shared because he doesn't have the option to on Reddit yet. I'm also really amazed at the lack of response. I kinda enjoyed it myself too!

I'm old enough to remember when we had to use email sparingly, because data cost a lot. And we had a whole team look over the details. Editing and writing like sending telegram.

The real coin we should be waiting for is when JPMcoin forks after Jamie splits to realise the true vision of JPMorgan. It shall be called JPM Cash and they will be distributed 1:1 to holders of JPM Core.

Distracted GF I guess is what everyone's calling it. Yeah, I saw it featured on BBC. I don't know how to credit, but it's from a 1950s issue of Leatherback magazine.

At least it's not like gold, which is created out of lead, and lead is taken from the air, which as we all know is nothing.

Is it rising faster than the rate of civilisation there?

Well done, my friend! It took me all of two years and then some too (made my shiny coin last year) but I genuinely feel happy to meet someone else still trying to do the same!

I'll try to make it simple for you. Using a service like LBC means you're only using 1 wallet, theirs. You don't control it they do.
The address assigned to you is marked by them as belonging to you. When you deposit to the address, LBC makes note of it and assigns your LBC account a balance. The actual bitcoin still goes to their wallet, and they sweep the balance in that deposit address to their own address (all this happens in the same wallet automatically.
Imagine a real life public wallet with many compartments each marked with a name. Every time you put money into that wallet's many compartments, the wallet owner checks automatically, sees which compartment has money, and then in a notebook he notes which compartment had how much. This is your account balance. he then empties his wallet. His public wallet is always empty. His notebook keeps track of who has money and how much. His notebook is what you see on your LBC account.
Whn you request a withdrawal, the wallet owner simply pays you money from his other wallet.

This picture is only worth about 20 words.

But merchants who care about what they receive in dollar value anyway aren't really accepting Bitcoin and probably never owned a single satoshi or a wallet. They're on Bitpay and that works for them. So yes actually, price doesn't matter for them.

Can already picture them Mcafees and Vers driving up in Astras on the next blockchain cruise, which might be on a leaky tugboat.

Some reactions in this article could be relevant to some of those questions:
Dash and others are appearing in Venezuela but only because of proactive effort from those projects. Otherwise, all other accounts suggest it's still Bitcoin being the most organic.

Am aware of talk about connected individuals also given licences for those new exchanges all coming up but okay, it's new to me about this preference for a legal rather than natural person. What difference does that practically entail? A verified individual? Suppose it would require even more care, but with escrow on lbc, doesn't require too much trust. Problematic I can imagine.

What makes us think the respondents knew any better selecting gold, Bitcoin or bonds?

Yeah, if he were truly just rooting for the underdog for the sake of it, there're a lot more lesser-known projects to shill for. Correct is also not necessarily a perpetual condition.

What's funny is that most Bitcoin "investors" never saw a set of private keys. And most gold investors never touched aurum.

I don't think we'll need to wait for 0 to see people pack their bags in mass exodus. I first saw self-professed old timers think it was the end when it crashed through 10k floor, made me wonder why when they'd clearly seen worse times. Trust me, even at 0, they'll be die hards.

So should I rescind their Nobel?
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:57:31
Yeah I don't typically buy into the "too big to fail" logic, but remove price discussions and it's really difficult to not see how every other measure of value has grown for Bitcoin. Be a while before people remember to refocus but I suppose all this talk of low prices is necessary culling. Less noise, clearer view of what's developing around it.

Tell me about it. Every damn time I try to use "my money" abroad, I've got to tell my bank I plan to use it when and where... as if I can predict my future purchases or payments. Then it gets declined anyway, for my own protection apparently.
