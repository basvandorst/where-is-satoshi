In that case though I wouldn't think bits is very useful. If even conversions with 1 dollar give you bits in the thousands then you'd want something roughly that same magnitude as a dollar. For small transactions it makes people feel comfortable about the appearance of the price and when you're dealing with amounts of money that actually matter you won't need to convert between millions of dollars and billions of bits.

never ascribe to nefarious will what can be explained by incompetence. 
I doubt the different interpretations stem from wanting to squash out bitcoins and just poor coordination between government agencies with respect to such a different entity like cryptocurrency

i think most of those words are subject to autoremoval because they've all at one time overdominated the subreddit and pushed out well diversified tech news. 
Not that I necessarily support a blanket ban on keywords like this. For such a high traffic sub it seems a little too heavy handed. Plus if they actually do autoremove certain titles based on words then they should tell the community that in the rules so they know how to submit content to that subreddit properly

the ironic part is that bags of snakes fall under state regulations for possession and care for reptiles and amphibians. 
At least I think it's ironic. To be honest I'm never gonna fully grasp what is and isn't ironic

I'm not talking about animal welfare laws. I'm talking about state regulations for the possession of reptiles/amphibians which lay out which animals you can and cannot own, how you can transport them, how you may lawfully hunt for them, etc.

In a scenario like cryptocurrency, adoption is the biggest thing for generating valuation growth. Proselytizing  might be annoying but it gets the Doge name out and builds the userbase while the people who find it annoying were likely never going to invest in Dogecoins in the first place

exchanges of property are still subject to tax on the value of goods you receive. So if you buy starbucks with bitcoins you're paying tax on the starbucks coffee you're receiving. Whether or not there's an additional capital gains tax from the bitcoins is beyond me but i would assume you'd be subject to that as well if the bitcoins you're using have appreciated in value since you bought them.

derivatives man. This is really good news. Small merchants might fear doing business in bitcoins because the effects of price fluctuations far outweigh the profit they make from the sale. Let's say I make a deal to sell you 9 gallons of industrial solvent in 9 months. You agree to do the deal for X bitcoins. Without swaps I'm now exposed to price risk for the next 9 months. if bitcoins drop in value relative to the USD I can end up losing money on the deal. Now that I can swap I can sell someone the promise of your X bitcoins in 9 months for a cash amount that's decided today and now I don't need to worry about the price of bitcoins because I'm no longer exposed to the risk. 
Swaps and derivatives are a big part of what makes international currency markets work too since it give vendors more options to deal with clients from countries with volatile currencies.
Derivatives also increase your options for handling bitcoins. If Puts and Calls become possible, then you can start constructing positions that profit when the price is volatile in either direction or other helpful setups. Derivatives themselves are a zero-sum game by design but they can add a lot of flexibility to the main market they support

For major users yes but in the short run businesses accept bitcoins because they think it will stimulate business and generate free publicity but they don't want to exposure to value risk to wipe out their operational profits.

the problem of course is that these things are totally state-legal but not totally legal since they are still federally illegal.

But there is going to be fractional value no matter how many decimal places you move over. Right now the conversion is .93 USD/100¥ or 1.07¥ per penny. That's just the nature of currency. where the decimal place goes is fairly arbitrary so it's nice that basically all major currencies line up on scales of magnitude
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:53:58
that would indicate that people are treating it as an investment. Any cryptocurrency that shows a potential for rising in value runs the risk of attracting buy and hold investors. Also if Doge does increase significantly in value then you would expect to see a reduction in the amount of carefree tipping as the community starts to believe their holdings will be worth some significant value in the future. Most of the benefits of Doge over bitcoins come from its comparatively low current value but not from any inherent advantage of the design (except maybe the fact that there isn't a hard cap on the supply to account for loss of private keys which may prevent it from becoming inherently deflationary in nature)
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:57:03
I think he's just saying that the 40,000 represented a Mezzanine donation to fill the gap between their funding and their costs so Dogecoins were used to cover ~30/80= 37.5% of the costs and not 30/40 = 75%.
Still nothing to sneeze at in absolute terms but Dogecoins did not make up the majority of their funding

People who can't get their BTC out of Gox but are afraid of a massive selloff when Gox regains functionality are willing to sell them on Gox and wait to withdraw the Fiat currency. The large number of sellers drives up the supply of bitcoins being sold in the market and so the price drops.

If it were reclassified as a currency then you wouldn't need to report every single transaction involving it to the IRS and gains below a certain level wouldn't be taxed. It really just a way to make bitcoins a more feasible medium for everyday usage

What should occur is merchants offer you a portion of the savings. They can benefit from undercutting other people's prices while still pocketing a portion of what they save. How much of the savings is passed onto the customer will depend on how competitive the market is.

yeah but it always sucked working with Yen in international finance. Every other main currency ratio is given as how many X will 1 Y get me but the yen is quoted as how many X will 100 Y get me. Gets real confusing when you're chaining together conversion equations

I'm curious about this point. Do you mean safeguard like protect from currency risk because obviously there's nothing to keep bitcoin's values from fluctuating in relation to any other currency and lose purchasing power. As for a safe place to store your money, bitcoins has some advantages over withdrawing all your money from the bank and keeping it under your mattress but you're better off keeping that stuff in a bank where it can earn interest (obviously if you'd like to ride the bubble up for the returns and cash out before the turn then be my guest, but in the long run, bitcoins will stabilize in value relative to other currencies and then its daily expected change will be 0 (meaning that the price has roughly and equal chance of depreciating and appreciating relative to the USD on any given day)
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:45:52
You need to take in opportunity costs for these sorts of calculations. Mining bitcoins was only profitable because bitcoins themselves were climbing in value. If not for the spike in prices you wouldn't have made any profit (and with the spike in prices you were better off just skipping mining altogether and buying bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:22:48
but if you don't have the discipline to cash out now when you're up, why would you believe you'll ever have it in the future even if the price goes up. I'm not telling you to sell all your bitcoins, man but at least consider cashing out some $ to cover your principal investment
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:02:16
and i give you a 4 for making me respond. Why exactly don't you think there should be any public property?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:54:07
even then I think they have to hold on to them for any potential appeals and since it's such a high profile case I don't think those bitcoins are going anywhere for a long time
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:36:16


That doesn't mean you shouldn't hedge. If you believe in bitcoins that's great but don't be so reckless as to put all your eggs into one basket. At least by some options for a fiat currency in case the whole thing ever goes to shit

It's a general problem for any system that charges a fraction of the amount for exchanges instead of a set fee since it leaves itself more open to bot manipulation which is a huge problem if there's actual money to be made on an exchange

it's hard going completely disconnected. All it takes is some mild laziness or a harmless shortcut somewhere in the chain and you've compromised the whole thing.

they saw profit compared to keeping their money in dollars but did they see profit compared to if they just converted the dollar amount they would pay to bitcoins and then holding onto those coins?
