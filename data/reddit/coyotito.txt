Just listened to it and found it really insightful. Jack basically describes how his family introduced him to Bitcoin and he started Zap as a way to show them LND in a more accessible form. He thinks since Lightning provides consumer facing features it deserves consumer friendly, accessible applications with which I fully agree. 
I hope Zap for iOS gets to an on device LND node enabled version soon to really use its full potential.

Or maybe nations are slavery as a whole, someone being born into random confines and forced to trade and socialize within a dictated area is deeply troubling. People talk about home and family, yet these forced structures are the main drivers for inequality and conflict that sustain an authoritarian economic system.

Best argument I heard yet, seems straightforward simple and logical. 
In a way it is the same as the current political climate, here is a system that was built with a specific form and purpose, and then detractors emerge out of the woodwork to argue that the same thing can exist without any regard for form and purpose. 
The issue is sustainability. Like someone saying they can put their head underwater and still live and breath, they are right for a few seconds.

I get the point. I was unsure how well defined the term actually is. I never understood why having a nominal cold storage device encoded and shipped by some small third party should be more secure than an offline mainstream phone that it is scrutinized and developed on a much wider range of security criterea. Or just use an analog medium like a metal plate with the wallet seed instead.

I am unfamiliar with the term SWSF in that context, but I generally I argue for coherence and honesty. SegWit is a coherent proposal, and not as dead yet as you make it out to be. The other thing is a distraction, it serves no purpose in the bitcoin model, unless you want to replace it, in which case why try to do that instead of making something separate in the first place.

Not really when you try to use bitcoin businesses where you can and use a prepaid credit card for the inevitable rest. Ironically for me that was mainly electronics purchases that I need to use bitcoin in the first place. 
Otherwise utilities is the main issue, they need monthly installments, SEPA only, not even credit card, and while becoming energy self sufficient is possible through solar, buying tap water is unavoidable with no proprietary well.

@_date: 2017-03-02 13:01:00
That all sounds convincing, but I still see the SegWit BU debate as a false equivalence where one is a technical proposal and the other is a political move. How can it be argued that these two are competing ideas when they are not? 
To me the whole conflict is completely artificial created by a political group in order to subvert a technological system. And in that regard there is a clear objective measure for truth and falsehood and one side being objectively wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:02:33

I also think in case of a crisis the network should be sustainable from anywhere with power and internet access and mobile devices would allow that.

Fair enough. It is a protocol issue though and it is the same with bitcoin. 
I was under the impression channels would regularly commit to the blockchain to legitimize the transactions, just not for every micropayment.

And yet when people here speak out against a protocol change that threatens decentralization they are told it is "just one of many features", we should "hear both sides". Shameful.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:39:30
My point remains that any extension to bitcoin has to offer value in the context of its principles. Like an autocrat leading a democracy there is an inherent logical flaw that cannot be solved through arguing. If you want to dismantle bitcoin, it is not a matter of debating perceived self interest, it is a matter of acknowledging facts. The moment you dismiss logical facts discussion is useless. It is cynical to speak of different sides as if they are somehow equal, rhetoric is no replacement for truth.

Good argument, yet why would a libertarian world imply widespread land ownership? 
The way I see it what is considered public space or land now can remain as such and I would suggest that without nation states widespread land ownership would actually be impossible since there is no centralized authority to enforce it and an individual has a naturally limited capacity to control space or even heavy objects for that matter. 
As long as mankind agrees to a worldwide civil code of conduct that could very well be negotiated through a decentralized system/blockchain in its own self interest there is no need to restrict movement in any broader way. 
It could be unrealistic, but I am fairly confident that the scope of our structures always depended on the reach of our communications methods, and if a worldwide currency can work there is no reason why other structures should be unable to adapt the same model.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:44:57


It is a free for all that dismantles the Bitcoin paradigm and sabotages it. 
Like the ill conceived Android open against iOS closed discourse it changes the meaning of words to present a wrong argument. BU is not about user choice, Android is not about user choice, both are about careful distraction and obfuscation of elementary mechanics in order to gain influence and manipulate.
Concepts like SegWit are simple and honest, anyone can see and understand their purpose because they respect the principles they were built around. Once the principle is gone, their is no honesty and no simplicity as evident in that long incongruous elaboration.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:31:19
How does SegWit change the current distribution of power? 
It seems to be a completely neutral malleability fix with an added effective blocksize increase. There is no political aspect as far as I can grasp it.

Trusting fools is unnecessarily degrading. I think our discussion shows why the moderation on this sub is warranted, you cannot go around using demeaning rhetoric like the koolaid anology call it productive discourse. I am at a loss why you dismiss all of my arguments in favor of blanket contrarian statements, and I am also sad about encountering such hostility in what should be a discussion of a shared interest. I try my best to view bitcoin as an inclusive technology and that is my sole motive in what I choose to support.

What core is doing is analogues to making counterfeit proof bills, there is value in currency technology, it is the base for trust. According to your argument there would be no point in using bitcoin since the fiat market is disproportionally bigger. 
The discussion always comes down to the same false equivalence of technology and user count. If bitcoin loses its technological advantages it will be abandoned as fast as it was adopted regardless of how many were using it at a time.

The reason Core consists of developers is because of what they do, write code. Any economist who is a skilled coder can participate in the same way, there is no ideological restriction, just the obvious reality of few interdisciplinary specialists. 
You are falsely equating politics with engineering. 
Then there is the existing limit of 1mb blocks, which was completely uncontroversial when it was adopted. Now Core is blamed for adhering to a longstanding standard and developing for it instead of against it, that makes no sense. 
Regarding forking the network, if it is such a practical method, why is BU refusing to do it and have their followers harass innocent users and engage in propagandist behavior instead?
Create a hardfork and stop blaming other developers for not following a political agenda. 
Expert is a generalized term, it implies no political authority, and the reason people support certain experts is because of their measurable quality of work, not because of ideological motives. 
SegWit has been tried and tested in many instances and so far no one has reported something noticeably wrong with it. It seems a completely conpetent and effective solution, and that is why people respect the Core expertise, not because of some political submissiveness. 
Facts have no ideology, and there is no point in arguing that they do.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:20:15
That is all pretty irrelevant given that SegWit is an effective blocksize increase and BU does threaten decentralization. If you want to convince me everything Core does is a ploy and conspiracy endless interpretative arguments might get us there, but BU remains dangerous as further bloating the blockchain just makes no sense. In my eyes bitcoin needs to be data efficient and I am looking forward to the day I can run a node on a mobile device, this is the scale I personally am willing to support, everything else is shortsighted. 
Like CPU manufacturing has a natural physical miniaturization limit, there are natural constraints to data storage and transmission and those need to be acknowledged.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:19:26
How is Core a group with narrow background and interests?
How is a malleability fix and effective block size increase a vision for making transaction costs higher than costs for running a full node for year?
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:57:14
Decentralization is a principle, not a feature. Changing the principle is removing structure. 
Activating SegWit is not sacrificing potential.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:20:55
The decision is technological, not political. It is about keeping the protocol technologically efficient and sustainable with the lowest possible participation requirements. Decreasing performance and raising hardware requirements means deferring power to centralized entities. If the protocol permits the adoption of excessive power and hardware requirements it confines the usage space as and increases vulnerability. 
BU increases centralization by lowered protocol performance, which is a political attack on technological development.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:07:49
The internet is highly vulnerable due its centralization, the Amazon S3 outage last week being just the most recent example. 
Wanting bitcoin to change its structure to a model from over 40 years ago gaining all its instability and weakness is absurd. 
Nothin is risked by activating SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:35:09
The discussion is about Core, naturally Satoshi is the founder of the entire project. 
The difference between conflict and competition is that competition relies on an agreed measurement. Here one side is withdrawing themselves from all rational measurement in favor of pure rhetoric and so creates only conflict. 
Censorship applies to governments, not private entities like reddit.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:55:48
Language skills can be improved and are really no excuse to diminish and hurt people. It just provokes the same aggression in return. 
SegWit carries no policy regarding future scaling methods and makes no protocol changes in that aspect. It remains a malleability fix and effective blocksize increase. 
A blocksize increase reduces protocol efficiency, why ever advocate for it instead of looking for alternative solutions regardless whether aligned with the Core roadmap or not?
For example concepts like Mimblewimble are worthwhile contributions, anything that is constructive and not regressive.

@_date: 2017-03-04 09:25:53
Any additional human parameter is risky, no need to make an emotional appeal for something objectively dangerous. The 1MB limit is a remainder from a time where the current user growth was unpredictable, its history of on chain scaling is no technical imperative for further risky protocol change.

Agree completely, it reminds me of the dismal computer technology discourse, where manufacturers get scorned for not releasing products at a consumer's whim or building ones with certain legacy trade-offs to lay the groundwork for future developments. 
Technology and code are no guaranteed natural occurrences, they require insight, creativity, personal commitment, and time. They work only within the laws of reality, something increasingly forgot with people's apparent ignorance on subjects like climate change and sustainable production. 
The Core devs by all accounts work responsibly, and their rationality stands in stark contrast to the unreflecting comments of their detractors. Thanks to all of them for dealing in facts in a year of unparalleled willful human ignorance.

In addition the process is currently unavailable for mobile users, the very platform you are developing for. PCs have become useless outside of development work and have no value for layman users.

Preach. Institutions run on currency, breaking the currency breaks the institution.

Then why the need for block weight instead of just only accounting for the transaction data bytes?

Exactly, emergence is a real phenomenon completely deceptively misappropriated in the EC branding.

There is your misconception, there is no such thing, no matter how many round tables are being held.

Yep, constructive discussion is a dead giveaway for intelligence. Same in politics, some talk about development, others about reversing.

The traditional voting process is the equivalent of having to shop only at physical stores and having to pay all cash exact to the penny, and you honestly expect the young to do this?
Technology has moved past this.

Except that would be like the police chanting together with antiauthoritarian protesters, self contradictory. UASF rejects the concept of authoritarian decision making.

There is no proof for anyone being Satoshi, the difference is that no one else is claiming to be him which is the issue.
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:03:19
I get the impression that regardless of all decentralized advantages in bitcoin it still struggles with the same essential problem of all political constructs, the reliance on a fixed contract. Only if a structure is inherently dynamic can it really compete with the inevitable fluidity of nature. Otherwise a power and control struggle will always rise to the surface again, and I think you are completely right in your assessment of this one.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:19:51
Seems like the ASIC monopoly would rather die with a useless hardfork demand in their cold dead hands than act rationally. BIP148 might be the last effective chance to make a difference. 
The less technical mainstream will adopt centralized alts as long as the immediate user experience is right, like with fiat the downsides will only become visible way later in the future. Instead of a solution we are steering right towards history repeating itself.

Android is "open", EC uses "emergence", these false equivalences are a tested method for rallying the technically uninformed masses, unfortunately technological realities are impossible to argue with willfully ignorant people.

No, it's a concept that requires implementation. Technology changes how we implement things, that includes our political organization, it's called progress.


They are participating in the democratic process, they choose not to support the current political structure because it's proved insufficient and failing, the trust is gone. 
Many young people are politically conscious, there's enough activism and invention, including in communities like reddit, but in new ways.
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:10:36
That list is fantastic, so many European services, maybe things are finally progressing here.
@_date: 2016-05-08 12:52:16
But voting isn't enough for many elemental decisions, hence the constitution and supreme court. But after centuries of legal erosion and civilizational progress they have weakend to the point of endangering the complete politcal structure. People realize this and few even bother engaging with the traditional system, that's why we see the rise of populists everywhere, because only they see any value in it.
Bitcoin and decentralized systems seem to be the best modern proposition yet to intelligently deal with politics again and appropriate for the current world population and education level.  
That's ultimately why we are on this subreddit, bitcoin is politics, using it an electoral process.

All iOS devices use proprietary chipsets, one more reason to move bitcoin towards mobile devices and make it more portable and secure in the process. Also another reason to build the protocol towards efficiency and not unnecessary bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:25:25
What about iOS? 
iPad Pro hardware is much more advanced and none of the typical storage and performance concerns apply.

How would election blockchains enable censorship and retaliation? 
Is lack of anonymity the issue when presumably every voter would have to use a publicly identified voting key to guarantee one vote per individual?
Is there no way to obfuscate the initial vote and tumble all votes before making the results publicly readable?

Can SegWit clients ever discard the witness data and reduce the block size or is SegWit just creating bigger blocks?
If SegWit retains all datasets and just reorganizes them node hardware requirements would still significantly increase with the new block weight.

The post title is misleading, this is about Android, not especially Android. Name one example of a storage security breach on an iPhone with secure enclave.

Not just smartphones, but tablets too. iPad Pros are more capable than many notebooks, a Node app is very much needed. There is no reason for Bitcoin to be tied to antiquated form factors when the progressive mainstream has already replaced PCs with mobile devices.

Bitsquare is unavailable for mobile platforms, which is a big barrier.

Abrasive was the word I was looking for, I appreciate u/Bitcoin_forever's uncompromising position, but maybe there's a more balanced way to communicate it, though it can be challenging in the face of the convenience-driven majority here.

In my case your past comments on this subreddit have helped me make decisions on how to set up bitcoin for myself, it's just that a civil tone usually helps the general discussion, but you do you.
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:27:23
Same as with Open Bazaar, why make it a desktop app in the first place?
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:49:16
What's it with this "nothing to hide" attitude?
 Not only is it completely besides the point, but by the same reasoning you could advocate for a police state, house searches without a warrant and more. I don't need anything "to hide" to want a right to privacy. 
Life without privacy is disgraceful and inhumane.

Why is this even up for discussion? If you don't care for a certain subreddit, unsubscribe or create an alternative. 
In my six months here I found r/bitcoin a valuable and considering the inherent controversy in decentralized currency civilized and balanced place of discussion. 
Reddit removing a moderator especially by intervention of a clearly biased company CEO would set a terrible precedent. 
I hope they will let this go and Reddit organize itself the way it's intended to.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:17:56
That's absurd, the "deadweight" is a critical part of bitcoin's self-organizing structure, what's wrong with these people?
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:20:19
Governments only have as much power as the people grant them.
What I don't understand is why there isn't a single mobile-accessible decentralized bitcoin app like Open Bazaar or Bitsquare so that the bitcoin can become untethered and as practical as carrying a wallet, without involvement of the same old centralized systems.
The biggest reason why people I've told about bitcoin didn't want to get into it is that they don't want to deal with services like Coinbase, which sound like just another less trustworthy bank to them. And rightfully so, these platforms negate all the advantages of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:13:05
That's like saying everything interesting in politics is happening in war zones, just because it's informative doesn't mean it's exemplary or good.

This is a genius, BIP148 facilitates a big block HF as much as SegWit activation, and once big block supporters fork off they have no influence on the SegWit chain. Everyone gets their way.

Yeah, is Chinese internet access really that censored and limited that local miners aside from Bitmain have no access to basic development information? Just one visit to this sub would probably at least widen their view on proper scaling. Maybe the language barrier makes them susceptible to targeted deliberate misinformation.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:24:40
Looks promising, and IPFS seems like a game changer in its own right.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:29:26
In that case there is a real need to bridge that language gap, maybe offer Chinese translations for important development pages and make sure to have different Chinese miners participate in the overall discussion. Some are obviously out to sabotage the network, but there is no reason to assume all of them are.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:17:58
Meta discussion is separate, not condratictory.

As a casual observer of the whole Ethereum situation I honestly thought it was done unless they hard fork it against their own principles and therefore again invalidate it. 
Coinbase adding Ether support at this point seems unreasonable if not irresponsible.

Infatuated? Their work is used by almost the entire network, stop using their work before piling on everything they do.

Funny how the uninformed masses have no problem criticizing an app like iTunes for its bloat, yet relentlessly fight for bigger blocks. That 1MB limit is invaluable.
