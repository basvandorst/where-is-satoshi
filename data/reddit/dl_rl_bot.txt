I did some  research on XRP, it has good things going 
a) 55 Billion coins in Escrow 
b) close to 100 banks are doing alpha/beta testing of Ripple products
c) I think by February XRP will be listed Coinbase
I did my research 2 weeks ago while it is at 30 cents, thinking about it then sudden jump to 70 cents, then after BCH coinbase listing jumped to $1.10 , all happened infront of my eyes.
I wish it XRP will be back to 70 cents to get in.
I do not know other two CND, ADA  as some one mentioned .

If the Senate Version is finalized, that may put lots of pressure on BTC in US as many people wanted to Sell before December 31st to take advantage of OLD Crypto Tax laws which are more favorable than new 2018 Tax Laws. This  can lead to 35% correction from the current highs ( when combined to recent 2 weeks run up )

I do  Crude oil and other futures trading on CME through InteractiveBrokers .
I agree in principle  with your thought  that Big Progressional traders will trying to short , but how does it work is not so easy .
How  big trader on CME short BTC futures down to 3.5k , for that there should be  Futures contract buyers on CME .
CME will have lot of big professional traders, all these professional traders know the futures game for decades, so BUYERS in this HUGE Shorting has to come from 'small individual investors' on CME . 
Initially there will be small number of people individual investors for BTC Futures on CME as many new BTC enthusiasits do not now FUTURES , they will stick with  Coinbase  exchange .
small number of Individual traders ( who are buyers) are not big enough to HOLD the Bag  from the BIG short positions  ( say 1000 BTC Future contract Lots, and so many such Lots ). 
Without enough Buyers at any given time, how do they Short big Lots of BTC Futures ?

I do Crude oil and other futures trading on CME through InteractiveBrokers, so I have some Idea on these big professional traders.

Without enough Buyers at any given time, how do they Short big Lots of BTC Futures ?
Same thing even if Lots of Professional traders wan to BUY 100 BTC Lots ( 200 such lots ) on CME Futures where is the counter party to SELL to ( the small individual investors on CME  for BTC futures ).
All these big traders must hoarding 10,000 BTC  on CoinDesk Gdax to begin the game .
Even then until you get ENOUGH small individual investors on CME BTC track , it is hard to do either huge ( 1000 BTC lots ) LONG/Short by professionals.

Old time Hodlers who added at 17k, 18k  , this 14k level must be very easy psychologically to add more .

I am new user to Reddit, learning about Bitcoins for last 6 months, not owned anything yet.
I have few years of trading experience as individual trader ( not professional ) on CME  Crude oil futures. 
Reading these posts on the upcoming CME Bitcoin futures,  based on my experience with CME Futures I think the daily volatility of Bitcoin price will reduce .
Regarding Bitcoin futures, yes it is all CASH settled , here is CME Bitcoin contract specification .
I am happy to answer any specific questions related to CME futures , how it may related to Bitcoin future contracts .
