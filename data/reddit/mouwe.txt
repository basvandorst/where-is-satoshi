**Support a farmer in Haiti 
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:15:03
I got screwed on PayPal:  received money on PayPal, sent the BTC, then the PayPal transfer got canceled saying his account got hacked.  The money got reversed, and I had to topup my negative PayPal balance.  I filed a complaint and dispute and tried for one year to get my money back, but to no avail.  PayPal is not very helpful, really.  I finally gave up.  Luckily the amount wasn't too big, but I won't use it ever again with crypto.  I hope my mistake will help others.

Hi, I'd like to suggest supporting farmers in Haiti: 
The donation goes 3 ways:
* supporting the farmer and his family
* supporting the nature reserve, which is one of the few in Haiti, while Haiti is a devastated bare country, no trees left
* supporting reforestation and food production
I hope someone will agree and give them some points. Oh, and I calculated that with 1 bitcoin they could hire 4 farmers for 3+ years.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:32
I'm using the htlc.me wallet. No history. I wish I could see the hops and other stats. Would be cool.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:05:09
LN will need bigger blocks, eventually, too
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:18:50
Hm okay, reforestation, trees, air.  Wait, are you breathing, too?
I learned a lesson and missed an opportunity for being honest here.  Should not have downvoted.  But we were just rallying for reforestation in Haiti.
We are a family trying to survive in a third world country.  I’m sure any other established charity is much more worthy of your donation.
Anyway, 10,000 trees is what we are offering.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:32:31
I fully agree we should do a one-time fork to 2 MB, to give LN more time to develop. I don't understand why we have to suffer $10 transaction fees, while a simple blocksize increase fixes it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:00
I thought this was an easy explanation:

Hi, I have a farm in Haiti and we accept bitcoin payments in our shop and bitcoin donations on our website. 
Thanks to and a former post of mine, we just started a new campaign **"Support a Farmer"**, see [wynnefarm.org/support-a-farmer](
For $100/month we can hire a farmer. Your donation has a huge impact:
* it supports the farmer and his family
* it supports our farm and nature reserve
* it supports food production and reforestation in Haiti
For 1 bitcoin we can hire 4 farmers for 2 years!! And if the price keeps climbing, we can go many more years!
Thank you for your kind consideration!

I appreciate your explanation.  But going from 1 to 2 mb hardly seems a big change.  But it would make bitcoin usable again, until LN kicks in.

Hi deannolan, actually I have been preparing today with friends to see if we could "win" the donation. I asked them to upvote for Wynne Farm and downvote the others. Was that a bad thing to do? Although I am also amazed by the amount of downvotes some are getting, we don't have THAT many supporters!
But Wynne Farm is definitely a legit organization, take a look at the videos on the website; that's us. And feel welcome to call us to verify. Also happy to connect on WhatsApp so you can see Wynne Farm live.
PS. Someone called me "sketchy" because of the ATM... yes I was thinking of getting an ATM to Haiti, but that had so little response that I let go of that idea, because I can't afford it just by myself.

I regret organizing ourselfes. But why is it bad to organize support for our cause?  Or can we only organize support with upvotes, not downvotes?  We're proposing a reforestation project in a country that desperately needs it. It's not filling anyone's pockets. Please reconsider.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:17:24
Hi what a FANTASTIC initiative! So happy Andreas got donated too!
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, and one of the reasons it is so poor is because almost all forests are gone.  There is only 2% forest left.  When you fly over Haiti you see just bare mountains, it is sad.  People cut the trees to make charcoal, to be able to cook. But without the trees, the soil and crops wash away when it rains, and the farming becomes unsustainable.
**We'd like to propose to do a reforestation project of 10,000 trees.**
We will hire 3 farmers and start making seedlings in our plant nursery, including making our own compost. When the seedling are mature, we will plant them on the nature reserve. We will be more than happy to send you reports and photos of our progress.
Your donation has a big impact:
* You support 3 farmers and their families
* You create trees in a country that desperately needs them
* Trees are the best way to counter global warming
Please consider donating to one of the last nature reserves in Haiti:
* 
God bless,

I'm afraid SegWit won't happen. Although they say LN can happen without SegWit. Still, I'm currently paying over a dollar transaction costs. It really looks like bitcoin is becoming like gold, and the only thing you can do with it is HODL for the future of my kids. Not bad, of course, but just not the bitcoin I'd like to see.

No details yet. Thinking of buying the Genesis ATM  and putting it at a supermarket in Petion-Ville, where the (relatively) rich people shop.

I'd suggest using the blockchain.info app because it is easy to use and one of the safest. Then get a Circle.com or Coinbase.com account, and keep bitcoins you want to save stored in their offline vaults. Circle and Coinbase are also very easy to sell bitcoin into your bank account.
Happy driving!
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:17:44
Don't keep your money in Coinbase or any other KYC (know your customer) company; they can block your account if requested by the police state. Be your own bank. Copay with trezor is a great idea.
