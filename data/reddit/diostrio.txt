Honestly, the gambling site I use adds fees to any card transaction, and also have deposit limits associated with cards. With bitcoin, there are no fees and no limits, including on payouts (a check in the mail costs $60.00, and that can be a big chunk of the small amount I’m gambling with.) I also try to deposit when the price is higher (to get a better USD exchange rate, and payout when  the price is lower (to acquire more BTC.) I’m a pretty responsible gambler and haven’t lost any bitcoin this year from it, in fact I’m up about 15%. Plus, I enjoy it. Do I think about the potential future price and what I could potentially lose if I make the wrong move or bet on the wrong team? Absolutely. But for the most part I play responsibly and within my means, and I’m good at cashing out when I’ve made some money. 
I also feel like using the BTC network is my contribution to the tech and space I believe in and want for the future, so I make sure I do my part every weekend. 
Don’t gamble kids.

I mean diamonds and precious metals have intrinsic value, in electronics and other tools. Are they classified as monetary valuables due to common perception?

Thanks for the terminology! Still new to all this but it’s nice to learn a lot in this sub. Any levels of this backtesting you think are of particular importance?
