Looking at your wall of text, I sure hope it isn’t an indicator for your real life behavior and standards. ;)
Besides… when you need to ***shout***, you’re probably wrong – so no one is going to read it.

Nice… more suspicious addresses to put on my BTC tracking list. Tnx for the heads-up. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:26:03
LOL – more like a fat, Noobian princess. ;)

Simple… because without bitcoin, he’ld be just another nobody. Remember who went to the CIA to give presentations introducing bitcoin at the time where SN disappeared from public screens. It wouldn’t make sense for him to destroy what provides so much to him.

Well, *somebody* was naive enough to waste [0.000105 BTC]( and *someone else* dropped some [0.0001 BTC]( – so both 1LLkNuQQ2GkS5DmQzsTxCmErUH8ew6dnDi and 1GX1tPvy4Y3PUeHzzpvtkWeyzhskVKTpf6 received deposits. (Poor peeps wasted their coins… somehow, I feel sorry for their lack of intelligent effort to check things.)

Just playing with tracking options… I guess that’s what infosec peeps do when they’re bored. After all, you never know when you’re going to need some of that superfluous data for one of those DefCon talks. ;)

Great, I’m not the only one who noticed… ;)
  
(For those interested to learn more about that,  nicely wraps up the fact that electic cars once were more popular too.)

I can confirm that you can run a full node via TOR… in fact, it helps me get around a nasty NAT firewall that stops me from running a “regular” full node. Thanks to TOR, I’m finally able to add my 2 satoshi to the network.

Then again, Peercoin (PPC) sure looks healthy with a current $0.42 PPC/USD ﻿price and a $9,298,917 ﻿market cap. And – ignoring their initial bumps in the road while launching – Paycoin (XPY) trades pretty nicely too at the moment, hovering around and about $0.62 XPY/USD. So, *some* POW-2-POS transitions surely did beter than others.
But maybe I’m getting you wrong when you write… 


I mean… we all know that from the practical side **every** POS coin starts out with a (short but significant) POW session, don’t we? ;) 
But if you’re hinting at coins that launched as POW and then decided to “hop on the POS train” just because it’s popular, you’re surely correct when saying that most of those tend to fail misarably. Yet, I wouldn’t blame POS for that… instead, I’ld point the finger at the coin dev’s marketing strategy – because that’s where most coins (POW and POS, as well as hybrids) tend to fail and – in the end – fall.

Never mentioned or said anything against game theory. Instead, I said that what **you** wrote is a collection of *personal opinions* (and a *blurb of non-realistic assumptions*). Obviously, there seems to be a small but important difference between what I wrote and what you think you’ve just been reading. ;)


Sorry to disappoint you, but all “possible outcomes” are “opinion” untill proven (or rendered into an actual outcome; which is somewhat the same from that perspective).


Any papers you could throw in as a reference? (Or are you simply relying on some posts you find on the net?)

Applauds…  
  
^(Honestly, that’s about the best reaction I’ve seen in a while… and it made me smile too. *+1*)

I guess he meant mining as Nakamoto intended it to be: done by users, not (centralized) pools and mining companies. That way, electricity costs would’ve been limited to ”oh, my computer is online and my wallet open anyway… so the loss of energy is rather futile”. But I guess that train has left Bitcoin station a loooong time ago. ;)

Right. So the Chief Technology Officer of Chainalasys was your main dev and even though you’ve “split up”, he’s still on your payroll as consultant? That makes me wonder how things fit your “internal goals are still total anonymity”. 
But don’t get me wrong, I know myself to be rather sceptical when it comes to things like that. As a matter a fact, the following relaxes my mind a bit:


Yet, what I’m missing is a *clear sign* from Mycelium – like ending the cooperation with your “consultant”, who obviously is having a good and well-payed time being the CTO of Chainalasys. 


Sorry to say so, but we all know the saying “talk is cheap”. A clear break from Mr. Møller would be the most logical thing and stop any suspicion in its tracks, thereby (among other things) protecting Mycelium from (indirect) negative press and propaganda. Besides – as you’ve indicated yourself – it’s not as if you don’t have a dev team that isn’t smart enough to handle things themselves. And in case you need another dev, I’m sure you'll be able to find one… coders like me have an inbox. ;)

When trying to convince people that your personal (mis)interpretation of something is correct, you might want to stick to your own rules…


All I’m seeing is personal opinion, but no “proof” or “evidence” to your own claims and personal interpretations. In fact, after reading this blurb of non-realistic assumptions (especially since you’re excluding important factors like “cost-of-attack” et al which were explicitly handled in most related papers), I’m not sure if you even understood the difference between a “theoretical analysis of a potential attack vector” and a “practically feasable cryptographical attack”.
Don’t get me wrong, but you might want to take a look at some of the “papers” handling these things (instead of some unnamed “posts” you’re referring to). When you do, I dearly hope that “proven to be cryptographically secure” fits your definition of “evidence” even if “it seems difficult”. Otherwise, reading scientific papers surely doesn’t make much sense in the first place. ■

I can’t help to be reminded of what Bruce Schneier always likes to say: *“Anyone can invent an encryption algorithm they themselves can't break; it's much harder to invent one that no one else can break.”* – Seems you actually managed to leverage the meaning of that quote into the realms of cryptanalysis. ■
