For anybody who doesn't know, HQ Trivia is a live trivia game currently only on iOS where people must answer 12 trivia questions in order to win, and if you win you split the prize with everybody else who has won. During this game, there was over 550,000 people who saw this question and who might become more interested in bitcoin and Coinbase.

I may not be the most well versed in Bitcoin and other cryptos but I just thought it was cool to see this while I was playing trivia. It's cool to see that it's becoming much more mainstream, sorry to ruin your day with my comment

Nice history of this being your only post ever

What would you share how about a fake review for what is most likely your business, and why would you post on this board? How about because you are self promoting a bitcoin scam. And how exactly is giving me your email supposed to prove to me that you are real?

Except that Bernie wants to create taxes on Wall St to fund his policies not print new money. And besides MMT says that it will increase inflation and has a couple of ways to lower inflation once full employment has been met. It doesn’t say printing new money won’t create inflation

I don’t think I’ve ever taken an Econ class that said we could print unlimited money without devaluing it. I’m not sure what school you went to though
