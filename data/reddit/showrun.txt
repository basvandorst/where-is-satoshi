I'm a network guy. I've been in the "IT" field since 1998 and I never spent even a single min looking into bitcoin but I did listen to Joe Rogan regularly. One day, in late Jan 2014, I was driving back from work and decided to play some JRE. I had no idea who Andras was and i was about to skip that episode, but i decided to listen to it, and that was it for me. I was mining with my laptop that night, ordered USB ASICS in the morning, realized those don't do shit and then got a couple of S1s the next week and i have not looked back since. Thank you Joe, thank you Anreas!!!

it sure does! but unlike a regular roller-coaster we are not sure the reason for the ups and downs! The real one we know it's going up because the rails point UP. On a figurative roller-coaster ride, as a human, I can't stop but try to understand what happened to make it go up and what happened to make it go down! Some times it's obvious, and some times it's not! I just wanted to ask that question from my fellow bitheads and start a conversation.  I hope it's ok with you.

No you don't! can you use an ATM w/o a computer science degree? the answer is yes! can you buy something online via paypal w/o having a Ph.D in cryptography? the answer is yes! same with bitcoin! If you want to use it then you just need to be a human! Dogs can't use it as they are too dumb! any human can get a hang of using bitcoin in no time! If you want to understand how the engine works and how satoshi solved the double-spending problem with a Proof of work system, then yes! you need to know about computers a bit. 
Can you drive a car w/o knowing how the combustion engine works? The answer is yes!

Of science to drop, and knowledge to lift
Please forgive our indiscretions, perversions
And always grant us the insight to determine
From here to kingdom come
Thy signiture will be respected
Hashes to hashes and the coinbase is collected
Thee vanquish those who trespass against us
And never trust those who must act as mt gox
Give us direction, provide us protection
And keep our blockchain from infection

Inflation, inflation, inflation. very much bitcoin related since one of bitcoins primary objective is to not be an inflationary currency. 
Also, note "usually". do you know what that word means? Usually means most of the time. so, by that definition, sometimes you can have a post that doesn't have the word "bitcoin" in it. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:08:53
something. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:54:43

Too many variables to really pin down why. Interesting to say the least. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:07:38
LOL. mmmkay. 
How are you going to say "it's Jargon with no substance" when they haven't even revealed anything technical? You should stop dismissing things when you have no idea what you are even dismissing.  Typical 
@_date: 2014-10-16 03:02:18
coinbase. But as soon as you get them, send them to an offline paper wallet and keep the paper safe in multiple locations! Do not hold 50 bitcoins in coinbase or any exchange! EVER!

Well that's the best place for it. Most amount of room, and depending on how the fight goes, most amount of TV time. One side the btc logo and one side the public key. Again... Not trying to be rude at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:56:58
No you're not. You're just a troll. By going through someone's posts, you can get an idea on what level their head is at. You should just go jointhey will be happy to find a new member.

@_date: 2014-07-05 19:30:17
how to determine the difference? Well, very simple. Has that idea been around for a while? or is it a new Idea? If you can't tell the difference between organized religion and ideas like, cryptocurrency or the "truther" movement, then I don't know what to tell you. Good luck in life. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:48:47

@_date: 2015-07-10 01:40:20
Daily transactions for 7 billion people + IoT + peco-transactions + Financial contracts + unknown unknowns can NOT all fit in one blockchain! It's plain and simple stupid. Payment channels and off-chain transactions are a must. If you think increasing blocks to 20mb now, and then doing this whole fucking dance again in 2 years [increase to 100mb] is a good idea, then i don't know what to tell you. This whole increase is so short-sighted, that it makes Dick cheeney look good 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:30:40
we need to do this!  and not increase blocks so only rich powerful corporation are able to run nodes! This WILL kill bitcoin, the idea! Right back where we started
