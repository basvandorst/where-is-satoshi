Bitcoin’s price reached such a high level for the first time in late November 2013,  soon after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the infamous Silk Road, in October 2013 when the BTC price faced a sharp decline to $80. However, such a huge jump in price in less than two months was caused by speculations of Mt.Gox bots and rapid popularization of cryptocurrency in China. The speculative nature of the bubble was too obvious, and it soon burst. 
The situation we observe now is completely different. During 2016, Bitcoin grew slowly, same as the interest of investors in digital currency. Regulator attitudes towards the existence and use of cryptocurrency are becoming less negative, compared to previous years. While the economic situation in Latin American countries, India and China forces their citizens to search for alternative payment systems, like cryptocurrency.

“Bitcoin is a victim of its own popularity, its contribution to capital outflow is negligible. On the contrary, it is bringing in foreign investment in Chinese market from investors around the world setting up mining operations in the mainland. The government is not cracking down on Bitcoin in my opinion, but trying to caution Bitcoin businesses against investor fraud and suggesting to businesses to maintain customer information.The impact on BTC price will be known in weeks to come as policy becomes clearer to both businesses and investors.  There are no major drops in volumes or trade on any major Chinese exchanges as yet.”  - Vishai Gupta, SearchTrade

“Banking on Bitcoin”, a new film which shows the history and future of bitcoin, is set to be released on January 6, 2017.
The film is produced by Gravitas Ventures, an independent cinema house founded in 2006. It will be launch in selected theatres come January. 
There are very many ways of recording history for future generations. Books, audio records, papers, articles and, most profoundly, movies. Movies can help keep records of how things happened in a certain period. Banking on Bitcoin, a 2016 film set for launch in early 2017, is said to say it all on the history and also tries to predict the future of bitcoin.

Aussie Bank To Unseat R3 &amp; Hyperledger In Blockchain Development Race
Australian banks are ready to replace both the R3 Blockchain Consortium and the Linux Hyperledger projects in the position of leaders who drive the development of Blockchain technology. This future is predicted by Thomas McAlister, an Australian expert at Bankcoin Reserve Pty Ltd, who works with governments and their central banks.
The Commonwealth Bank Of Australia embraces blockchain technology in a move that will see the bank develop its own blockchain hub later in 2020. The bank is implementing an ambitious goal of the Sydney government set up earlier in 2014.

David V. Duccini, lead developer of GiveCoin 2.0  and founder of the Strength in Numbers Foundation, commented to CoinIdol.com: 
“Their CORDA platform is long on promise and short on delivery. They have oversold, like so many in this space, their abilities to deliver. R3 is NOT on par with an ANSI, or an X.9 group. And I think that Goldman and now Morgan Stanley decided that giving money to a group that didn’t have the horsepower to deliver a product that ultimately would benefit their competitors more than themselves was not tenable.”

The report states:
“Under President Trump, the US fiscal spending increases the US budget deficit from $600 billion to $1.2-1.8 trillion. This causes US growth and inflation to skyrocket, forcing the Federal Reserve to accelerate the hike and the US dollar reaches new highs. This creates a domino effect in emerging markets, and particularly China, who start looking for alternatives to the fiat money system dominated by the US dollar and its over-reliance on US monetary policy. This leads to an increased popularity of cryptocurrency alternatives, with Bitcoin benefiting the most. As the banking systems and the sovereigns of Russia and China move to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD, Bitcoin triples in value, from the current $700 level to $2,100.”

The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has taken the all-time risk of pledging to resign after a negative result of a referendum on a constitutional reform which could make it easier for the government to pass laws without unnecessary delays.
The referendum ended with the ‘No’ campaigners, led by opposition politicians of the 5-star party, winning by a margin of more than 60%. CoinIdol.com Blockchain News Outlet will examine the effects of this referendum on Europe as a whole and the position of cryptocurrencies in Italy. Was the referendum necessary? As is the case in many democratic nations, critical decisions of public interest are made by the public through a majority vote process of referendum. In Italy, the prime minister saw a problem in how the government is run because of a lot of delay fr om the parliament, so with a Yes result he would be able to speed up the process of passing a bill. What are impacts of the referendum on cryptocurrencies and bitcoin ?
