You should do you own research but basically BCH is the big blockers answer to the scaling debate. Bitcoin is pursuing offchain scaling solutions like lightning while BCH increased the block size limit. I will leave the relative merits up for debate.

In the email they sent out they said they would support buying and selling as well as sending. So a proper exchange

People exchange USD for USDT so they can buy BTC on exchanges. If Bitfinex doesn’t have 1:1 USD/USDT then they’re essentially printing money and whoever is holding it when that’s found out will find it worthless. It could be FUD but it’d be nice to have them clear it up with some transparency.

Why does it matter what name I call it. Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash. Bcash. Who fucking cares. This stupid flame war is toxic to both communities.

It is free, I’ve done exactly this before moving coins into cold storage.

Yes but you need to be verified I believe

Then why the attachment to the name? Shouldn't you be more concerned with getting people to use it than copying the bitcoin brand?

For real. Pay your taxes. It wasn't the FBI that brought down Capone, it was the IRS. Set aside some of your magic internet money to make sure you can enjoy it from outside a prison cell.

So they can air drop it to everyone with BTC and hope people don't look at where it came from.

I never said you could predict it I was just adding on to what was said before. You picked where you thought the top was. Objectively you were off by a wide margin. You still made a lot of money and it was probably smart but that doesn’t change the numbers after the fact. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:50:59
Because the top so far was actually almost double where you cashed out.

This is how to do it in my experience. You have to Yoda it. Do or do not. There is no try. The people that *try* to quit smoking usually end up *trying* their whole lives unsuccessfully. It's a mental trick that puts you in control. 
What made the difference for me was to make it a rule- No more buying packs. Then i could still have one at a party or something without breaking my rule and feeling like a failure. Without having them around for a couple weeks to smoke when I was bored the obsession faded and I didn't crave it anymore. 
Sometimes I'll smoke hookah or a cigar with friends but i don't touch cigarettes anymore and it feels good. Moderation is key. I do enjoy tobacco but it was controlling my life. Sorry for hijacking your post I just wanted to share this.

It’s almost as if the market is more than just the sum of the individual players or something. Like if utility were somehow inherently attractive to people. But what do I know, I’m not a ~~fortune teller~~ economist.
