That is quite a stretch and an wildly imaginative conspiracy theory, and also demonstrates an entire lack of understanding of Ripple and the XRP ledger.

Hey fellow hodlers,
Thought I'd post this in this sub as well since I think most newbies start in Since there's a huge influx of mainstream attention now, and a ton of newbies flooding in to invest, I thought it's important to write a guide for all the beginners getting started, to get a better understanding of how everything works.
I know when I first started trading months ago, it took a while to learn all about the technology, how to trade, the projects, how wallets work, etc. So I wrote this guide that attempts to dump what I've learned over the months, and to break everything down in an easy to digest manner.
Here's a quick overview of the topics:
* Wallets
* Exchanges
* Trading
* Managing your portfolio
* Security &amp; safety
* Common mistakes
* General tips &amp; advice
* Resources
If there's anything inaccurate or not clear, feel free to let me know, any feedback or critique is appreciated!
Hope this helps out all the newcomers, and good luck! :)

From what I’ve been reading IMO the price of Bitcoin will start to be increasingly liquid, and increasingly stable. The two just goes hand in hand and with more liquidity and a larger market and user base, the harder it is to short or manipulate the price, and more resistant it is to negative news. So I think those 50-75% drops in value are going to be increasingly rare. Especially now that major markets are already trading futures. 
Long story short, the best time to buy was yesterday, and the second best time is today. Just buy and Hodl.

Sure they could do that. But if you look at the big picture which consumer in the right mind would willingly signup to an internet service that will impose fast lanes or restrictions? It hurts their overall adoption and less users can result in not just less direct revenue but revenue from other opportunities. If you check out the latest article on the verge regarding all ISP’s stance on net neutrality, Google (more specifically their fibre division) has voiced out their concerns about the repeal. 
Call it political posturing, but at the end of the day it’s an arms race and the companies who don’t offer a fully open internet are shooting themselves in the foot. It’s simply competition.

There are more use cases for Bitcoin than hodling. It’s a store of value. And if scalability issues can be solved then it can be a viable currency, if not at least a better payment methods than traditional banking and remittances.

Thanks man!

You’re forgetting Venezuela. There is real usage even in its current state, and it’s an interesting case study. For the first time they have a currency they can store their wealth in and spend, which actually appreciates in value over their native currency. 
Sure, the transaction fees recently have gotten quite high and there are a ton of pending transactions and congestion on the Bitcoin network, and vendors like Steam just pulled out of accepting Bitcoin as a result of that, but these are things being actively addressed and worked on. There are viable technological solutions. Just months ago Bitcoin was fairly useable and was gaining momentum in terms of merchant adoption. 
The biggest problem plaguing Bitcoin and it’s road to scalability is governance and internal politics. But that’s a whole other discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:44:01
Did you mean less volatile?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:00:34
It could, but I don’t believe that repealing net neutrality is the business model of these tech companies. More or less these companies have some level of good will behind their projects, and they have more to gain by leveraging the data and eating away at the market share of these traditional ISPs. You can bet Google and Facebook would not impose restrictions because they want an open and free internet so they can sell you ads everywhere.

I’ve seen and heard this argument before (as commented above as well), and I have yet to see a good counter argument. This is what’s making me hesitate to invest at the moment until we see how futures will affect the market. Anyone care to take a stab at it?

Honestly, this kind of raw, unfiltered real life stories of hearing there are other people out there with grand visions and optimism for shaping the future of the world, and random acts of kindness which trumps malice, really gives me faith in humanity. And it's something we need, when the majority of the world seems over-glaringly focused on the negative and the pessimistic.
The fact that such a seemingly small thing, a single negative tweet, can spark such a wave of positivity and genuine kindness from complete strangers, really goes to show not only the power of interconnectivity the internet has brought us, but the greater desire to help one another that we all have but don't often get to show.
Not to sound overly melodramatic, but for me, is a small glimpse of why I always strongly believe that no matter how great the obstacles or how hopeless things seem (see current net neutrality situation), we as the common people will always find a way to overcome the impossible. 
This is why Bitcoin has such traction, not only because it's "digital gold", it's because it is an idea, and a manifestation of an idea, of a vision of the people, of a better future, a brighter future. 
I am seriously so excited about the future of blockchain and cryptos, and I can't even begin to fathom how it will transform every aspect of not just ur lives, but greater society, for the better.
Thanks for sharing this story OP, keep on doing what you're doing, and stay hungry, stay foolish!

I said the exact same thing the other day too in a conversation. Tech companies are trying to bring the next generation of network infrastructure in place. We could see the shift from traditional ISPs to these tech companies in the next decade or two. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:01
Good point, will include that!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:18:46
Better late than never? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:35:59
Fair enough. Either way the service will be considered as a whole, not just the overall upload and download speeds and monthly cap. If people are going to need to pay extra for Vimeo or other services it eats away at the cost/performance advantages. IMO I just think there is more to gain by scaling your user base and then monetizing off other things than putting up paywalls for open access.

Saw this in another thread, thought you’re doing an awesome job, keep up your great work sir ����
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:52:33
There are opposing views and more nuances to this, but generally speaking, in Bitcoin’s current state, there are those who believe it will continue on its path to increase in value over time due to its scarcity, as a form of “digital gold”, and this is partly due to the way that things have played out in reality, versus its original intended usage of being “electronic cash”. In that scenario there are people who believe it will act as some kind of digital reserve. 
The way that mining has sort of centralized over the years, and the way that Bitcoin is running into scalability issues (which Lightning aims to solve), as well as market behaviour and speculative frenzy have all contributed to this. This was especially true in December when fees saw a massive spike, rendering it inhibitively expensive to transfer BTC around.  
If scalability solutions like Lightning does as intended, and reduces fees, increases speed, on a global scale, and BTC becomes more liquid, it will perhaps shift over to the other end of the spectrum where it will see increased utility as a currency, as it will be an efficient one. 
A broad explanation, but hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:29:01
I think they are defining store of value not just by the definition of it remaining a safe storage of funds where it wouldn’t decrease in value, but rather increase in value over time. Although you are right, technically speaking if the value remains constant, it would qualify as a store of value as it would be a safe harbour against hyperinflation for example such as what happened in Venezuela.

Congrats! Stories like these are always an inspiration of the positive impact of cryptos, and the many lives it touches. Thanks for sharing!
I’ve always been curious though, for those who cashed out a lot of Bitcoin, and in this instance it sounds like it, did you guys have any troubles withdrawing it? Whether through the exchanges or how did you convert to fiat? How did you deal with tax implications if any?

Crucial to bring up the malpractice of Canadian banks closing accounts and banning crypto related transactions. 
This is a new industry that needs support and freedom to thrive. This kind of behavior from the banks is harmful and stifle innovation.

Really hate the narrative they’re painting here, that the crypto space is a get rich quick scheme, but as an ad, I’m sure it’ll pique people’s interest. 
Prepare for a rush of newbies, let’s do our best to educate and inform and collectively we can raise the level of knowledge of crypto and ya underlying disruptive technologies.

Correlation is not necessarily causation. It could just be articles taking the tone that reflects the market conditions.

They’re not wrong, but the context and implied meaning of the tweet I suppose is drawing attention to the irony of the Fed essentially calling crypto deriving value only from perception and consensus (which is really what money is anyway), and the Feds printing fiat money on demand.

Hi everyone!
Figured I would share this here. Since diving into the crypto scene a while ago, and making some investments myself, I started looking for an app to help me manage my portfolio so I can see my gains/losses.
After trying a bunch of apps out there, there just wasn't one which I really liked, or could get the insights I wanted, not to mention most of them required you to manually enter your data.
So I've decided to create my own portfolio app since I wasn't happy with the ones out there to manage my own investments. Wanted to create something for the community and see who might find this useful. I’ve decided to call this the Matrix Crypto Portfolio app for now :)
I've started kicking this around in some subreddits last week and got good feedback. Original thread: 
I posted a few more updates and more and more people were interested, so I'm officially going to start working on this, so feel free to offer any suggestions or feature requests in this thread, would love to get the community's feedback! 
**[ABOUT MATRIX]**
**Signup for beta here (It’s free! Duh!):** 
**Video demo:**  
**[UPDATE JULY 7th]**
**Tablet/Desktop quick mockup:**
**Tech stack**
So looking into it my dev and I are most likely going to build this in React Native, as there has been many requests to bring this cross-platform. Plan is to release it mobile first, web version to follow, currently working on tablet/desktop mockup. Looked into Ionic but I think with the graphing React Native may be better performance wise.
Plan to introduce it with a detailed financial graph with zoom details, candle sticks, Bollinger bands, etc.
**API Syncing**
Will launch with initial ability to connect via API to exchanges (read only), we understand trust and privacy is a big issue. This is to avoid tedious manual entries of your transactions for accurate gains/loss
**Cross platform (Registered AND guest support)**
In the older threads I got a lot of questions why we plan to introduce a login system, and the only answer to this is because I want to have the convenience of checking my portfolio anywhere, so that will require a login to sync your account. However, I understand some people would rather not signup, so we plan to also have a guest account capability, with option to convert it into a registered account. Decision is up to you, the user.
**Release plan**
iOS/Android first
Web/desktop/tablet to come after
**Upcoming Roadmap**
* Plan out architecture
* Plan out features for MVP
* Build out account system
* Finish high fidelity design mockups for mobile
* Finish high fidelity design mockups for tablet/web
* Map out all user flows
* Integrate 3rd party APIs and data sources
* Integrate graphing functionality
Email me at matrixcryptoapp with any suggestions or feedback! 
Ultimately I’m building this for myself and the community to use, have a feature you think would be crucial to make this app successful and useful? Get involved!
