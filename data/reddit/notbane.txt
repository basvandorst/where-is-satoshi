24, high school education. This is my second post, I usually just read the comments and click on the links.

I installed a widget on my phone that displays the value, since then it's been dropping. Interesting to watch.

I'm on my phone and use baconreader so wasn't aware of the sidebar, I'll be sure to check it out tomorrow. I did use the search feature but it was giving me posts from over several months ago, which I imagine could no longer be helpful. If my post is not valid please downvote it, I'm just a man interested in bitcoin and looking for some help. Thanks.

Bitcoin paranoid which is displaying in GBP price. I'm also using simple bitcoin widget which is displaying USD price. 
Personally I prefer bitcoin paranoid, you can set alerts for price changes of certain percentages.

When I first considered buying it was around £100 a BTC when I bought it cost £140, now it's around £250.
I can afford to loose the money I spent, my girlfriend put it into perspective when she asked how much would I spend on a night out drinking.

Is it safe to create a wallet and do it over my smartphone? Or should I wait until late have access to a computer tomorrow? Thanks for the help.

I have 0.2, I bought 0.6 but had to sell 0.4 because I had no cash until payday, I made my money back and some profit. Hoping to get up to 1BTC soon.

I spoke to a guy in the office, he was very interested but said he couldn't afford to loose any money at the moment. I think many people feel this way, only put in what you can manage.

I'm up north, believe the train fair down south is getting more expensive the closer we get to xmas. I will definitely keep it in mind and see if I'm free to make it down. Thanks for details.
