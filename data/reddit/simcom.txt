I think they only cover the first 20 withdrawals or something like that, it would be hard to scale up that attack given that you need to submit ID info to create a GDAX account. Coinbase.com makes the user pay the fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:24:33
A real attempt to scale the network now (not 2 years from now) would help. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:13:43
It is possible by monday or sometime next week (I expect the network to catch up over the holiday weekend bc of fewer people doing transactions). Fees in the 10 cent range are probably never going to happen again though. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:37:42
Fees are too high anyways...
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:07:59
The third party service would still end up with a bunch of unspent outputs, (One for each payment they accept), so the reciever is also on the hook for massive fees when those coins are eventually moved as well (The burden doesn't just fall on the sender unfortunately).

Why, with fees this high it makes no sense...
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:30:59
Ahh yes, a nice summary of the narrative. By the way these 1.1MB blocks are really doing wonders! Clearly the most optimal solution! Go back to any reddit post from &gt;2 years ago. Not increasing the blocksize was never mentioned. The debate was how much to increase it by. Segwit is not a blocksize increase, it is a clever way to make transactions smaller. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:30:10
$10? That is so last week. I sent one today and paid $22 using mycelium's non-priority setting.
I love watching the price go up but it's heart-wrenching to see what these fees are doing to bitcoin. I can't believe it has got this bad with no substinative action from the devs. 4 years ago I would never have imagined that in 2017 we would still be at 1MB blocks and I'd have to pay $20 to get a decent shot at a timely confirm. The lack of leadership is disgusting.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:17:58
This isn't early tech, it's been around for 9 years. Lots of thought went into scaling over that period and raising the blocksize was the obvious and effective solution while 2nd layer solutions were in the works. Yet, despite near universal support for a blocksize increase - core failed to do it for unknown reasons. Now we have a competing fork, skyhigh fees, and a mempool hundreds of thousands of transactions deep. There's no need to sugarcoat reality here. Gavin should be back in charge, these idiots have proven they are not capable of leading a project this large and should do the community a favor and resign. Go ahead and work on LN on testnet for a few years until it is perfected and ready to be deployed. In the meantime give us bigger blocks and competent leadership.    
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:25:03
The problem with all of this semantics is that people fall for the idea that a 2MB segwit block is the same as a 2MB hardfork, it's not. Had we done a 2MB hardfork the network would have immediately had twice the capacity, and may have actually been able to handle the influx of people the last few months. Instead we got a "Segwit Block" that's currently about 1.1MB because nobody's using it, so it's barely having any positive effect on the network. Don't get me wrong, I think segwit's great, but if we could go back in time I'd much rather have a 2MB hardfork than segwit. Why? Because it would prove that the devs are capable of making major improvements via a hard fork, and our fee/congestion problem would not be nearly as bad as it is today.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:57:33
Yep that's another normal non-spam transaction. Businesses that process deposits and withdrawals from customers typically have transactions that look like this. Basically they are spending many outputs (the deposits they recieved from customers in the past), and are spending these to the various addresses you see there (each output is likely a seperate customer doing a withdrawal). Instead of broadcasting a separate transaction for each withdrawal they package many withdrawals into a single transaction which greatly reduces the network fee per withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:33:32
I prefer the system we have now where the miner gets to choose which transactions go into the block. Also your first point can be easily avoided by the miner, and would just incentivise him to fill the block with junk transactions if he didn't have enough real ones to fill up the block.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:11:49
Those are normal transactions, not spam transactions. If you're sending coins and you don't care if they arrive today or sometime next week, a fee in the 10-20 sat/byte range is perfectly normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:46:54

s2x was a last-ditch effort to get some sort of increase after core had repeatedly shot down all other proposals. It had decent support from the community if I recall correctly. Not sure if you could call it a majority or not. Core argued it must be a supermajority 90%+, there were other proposals XT, etc that had support as well. I think it's safe to say that the vast majority supported some sort of blocksize increase.

LN is not going to be free. It's a pay-to-use 2nd layer on top of the main blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:42:09
So what would happen if someone is buying bitcoins at a bitcoin ATM. Does the ATM have to open a new payment channel with each customer? If so, is that even feasible considering you need to broadcast a transaction to the network in order to open a channel and there's already no space in blocks? 
Also if the transactions are always from the ATM to the customer (the customer is purchasing bitcoins), what is the point of opening the channel?  Can you increase the bitcoins in a channel without creating a new one? This seems like it would mostly be useful for companies where transactions occur between them frequently, such as Coinbase&lt;-&gt;Gemini&lt;-&gt;Bittrex&lt;-&gt;Kraken. Where am I going wrong here?

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
In the first pargraph Satoshi describes the problems with the current financial system that Bitcoin was designed to solve. 
... The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
**minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**
.... What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted

The lower that number goes the higher chance of orphaned blocks. I think that's the original reason that number was not set lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:38:24
There is exactly zero chance that the mempool will ever be emptied again. The only possible way that could happen is if blocksize is dramatically increased, which does not look likely. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:12:29


Check your math...
4.8 MBps x 8 streams = 38.4 MBps which is **307 Mbps** not 307 Gbps per second. Big difference :)

It's possible that the number of users may only need to rise modestly to see transaction prices that high.  Once the number of transactions on the network exceeds capacity of the block sizes, transaction costs could rise quickly. There is no reason why a specific x:y ratio of users:txn_costs will develop.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:28:00


No need to rewrite history, the community was decidedly in favor of increasing the blocksize, and were vetoed by core.

At the time they made a judgement call, they assumed that segwit would be adopted promptly, and LN would arrive before the network experienced any major congestion. They were wrong on both points obviously,  mostly because  the price unexpectedly rose 20x  and tons of new people joined. So looking back it's clear to pretty much everyone that raising the block size would have been the right move in conjunction with segwit. 
My only question is, if a block size increase is on the roadmap anyway as they claim, why not move it up now that the mempool is completely gridlocked? If you're planning to raise the block size in the future anyway, what's the harm in doing it a little sooner now that the network has grown faster than expected? The fact that they have been so adamantly against raising the limit and doing any hardorks, and there is absolutely no talk of raising the block size in the near future, makes me suspect they have no intentioin to ever  do it. If not now then when? AFTER LN is finished? It just doesn't make sense.

Yea that sounds like luke. He has argued in other threads that the network can't handle 1 MB blocks because his *personal* upload speed is 500 kbps and his node can't relay the blocks fast enough. Like the inadequacy of his internet connection is somehow relevant to this debate.

Well, I see what you're saying, and I think you are right, I'm sure webpages and phones will be much more alive than they are today, but what exactly will require so much bandwidth?  I mean, even if your whole screen, every single pixel, is streaming content, how would this require 64 Gbps internet? 
Maybe if screens got so cheap that you could literally wallpaper your whole house with 8k screens. And you were streaming content to all of this wallpaper concurrently, then maybe you would need a 64 Gbps connection? That's the only thing I can think of.

Even if say 20% of connections are that bad, I don't think it's news to anyone that solo-mining on such a shitty connection is not a good idea. Do we really want to pretend that miners are retarded and they won't mine the most efficient way possible? (ie use a pool if their connection sucks??).  Making protocol decisions based on a 1 mbit connection is like trying to design the interstate highway system to accommodate the horse and buggy. It's been over a decade since I've seen speeds that slow (Even a below average mobile has speeds over 1mbit UP!). it's time to move on, we should not be trying to accommodate every fringe case.

@_date: 2015-12-03 15:40:11
Well, I understand the sentiment. And I agree with pretty much everything except the time frame. Just looking back to the year 2000 when I got my first DSL connection (3mbit) to now where I have a 20mbit connection at about the same price.. a whole 15 years have passed and there has been a really disappointing lack of progress in this area. I just don't agree that we should bet the farm on the hopes that 64 gbps internet will be widely available in 20 years. It will probably be narrowly available, and any miner that is not located in one of those jurisdictions will not be able to participate - which would kinda suck. 


This seems like it is probably a typo. Did you mean 100 Gbit?  Even 100 Gbit though seems faster than anything I've ever heard of.

I don't understand. Broadcasting transactions requires very little bandwidth. Miners and people running full nodes are the only ones who will need the bandwidth, you think just a few thousand people will be enough to drive worldwide infrastructure development?

The core devs were wrong not to raise the blocksize limit, it's crystal clear now, yet there are still some people on here who pretend that everything's ok. It's not ok, bitcoin has been (and is currently being!) permanently damaged by their poor decisions. I'm not a shill or a newb.

my guess is 15 cents?  1 year is a short time frame to be thinking about these things though.  In 10 years if we are still at 1 MB blocks I'd expect the fee to be ~$20-200 per transaction.  Of course the growth of the network would be severely negatively impacted in such a scenario.

by playing the edge of the spread with limit orders, market makers have the effect of increasing liquidity and reducing spreads.  So when this bot is throwing cash across the spread, it is doing the exact opposite of a market maker, it's increasing the spread and reducing liquidity (and losing money to slippage with every trade). I guess you could call this bot a market *un*maker :D

This is true - but wasn't actually the reason I told him to do it in $1k increments - I was more worried about him being scammed of a large amount on LBC.  Much safer to spread your risk and do it in smaller chunks.

Probably just a handful of satoshis, it could even be as low as a single satoshi per bond. Every time they move on the blockchain they will need to pay the miners fee though.  So if there are lots of these securities out there people will need to have some BTC in reserve to pay fees.

Well I have to admit, I also think it is quite aggressive.  The problem is, I don't see what is going to drive the infrastructure improvements that will lead to widely available 64 gbit/s internet speeds (which would be required to download an 8 GB block in 1 second in the year 2037).  What technology will require such an internet speed?  I mean lets assume we are streaming 16k virtual reality (different stream to each eye) to 4 headsets from a single internet connection (8 concurrent streams).  How much bandwidth would that require? By my calculations it would be about 1-2 gbits/s. Maybe less considering there will certainly be improvements to codecs in the next 20 years. So what other technology will exist in 2037 that will require such massive bandwidth to the average connection?  I think I could get solidly behind bip 101 if I had a convincing answer to this question.

I'm not saying it will be impossible technologically, I'm sure the technology will exist.  But will any company bother to build the infrastructure for 64 Gbit internet to the home? The reason download speeds increased from 56k to 100Mbit was because there was an obvious source driving demand for speeds to make this leap (HD video largely).  But what will drive the demand for internet from 1 Gbps, to 10Gbps to 64Gbps?  That's what I'm concerned about.

basically overstock is "tagging" a single satoshi (or a few satoshis) and using that as a token to trade a new bond they are issuing.  Whoever owns the "tagged" satoshi owns the bond.  So you could essentially transfer ownership of the bond by sending the "tagged" satoshi to someone on the bitcoin network, and only pay the default miners fee (1/3 of a cent).  This is much cheaper than how securities such as stocks and bonds are currently traded whereby there are settlement companies involved who siphon off a fee, can take days to settle the trade, and true ownership can be hard to prove in some situations (ie situations can arise where two people think they own the same security). Using the blockchain to track ownership of the security solves these problems.

They are creating lots of transactions, which will have to wait in a queue to enter a block - the blocks will still only come once every 10 minutes. 
Think of it like a train.  The transactions are passengers, and each 10 minutes a new block (train) comes to pick up at most 1MB worth of passengers. If there are too many passengers (transactions) there will be a lot of people waiting at the station (mempool) waiting to catch a ride on the next train (block).  It doesn't matter how many people are waiting at the station, only 1MB of people may enter the train every 10 minutes.  Lots of people are pushing to get that limit increased to 8MB, that's what they are referring to in the article.

Yea that was my first thought also, but maybe some of those ebay powersellers will crosspost some of their stuff to open bazaar.  I mean if the fees are zero what do they have to lose?  Plus they can split the savings they get from zero fees with the customers - seems like a win/win for everyone.

Well, anyone selling bitcoin in the US without an ID requirement is breaking US law. In order to sell bitcoin you must register with the feds as a Money Services Business, and all MSBs must at the very minimum identify each customer to check their name against the US terrorist watchlist. There are other identification/reporting requirements for large amounts as well.

The volume from most exchanges is being generated by bots trading back and forth, these bots feed off of volatility, ie. when volatility is low (as it is now) the bots do less trade volume.  Localbitcoins on the other hand reflects more of the real world demand for BTC (in my opinion). People who buy on LBC are doing it because they need coins fast (ie cryptolocker victims), want to maintain anonymity (darknet folks), or are or are hoarding coins away from prying eyes.  That's my best guess anyway.

I made no mention of bitcoin nodes, only bitcoin solo-mining nodes. I have no evidence that bitcoin miners have &gt; 1Mbit connections, just as I have no evidence that bitcoin miners have &gt; 56k connection.  You can of course make the arguement that this must logically be the case because miners are acting in their best interest and solo-mining on a 1Mbit connection would be uneconomical due to increased orphan rates.

I've been watching it for 2 hours now - it might have been operating before that but I don't know.  For a brief time (~5 minutes) it was selling 2 BTC instead of buying.  Even though it's only 2 BTC every 30 seconds it is doing a pretty good job of chewing through all of the open sell orders on coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:14:57
Wow what a find!  You know these coins are worth nearly 1 million dollars right?  On where to sell them - It depends on the country that you are in.  In the US i would suggest moving them to coinbase in small chunks and selling.  If I were you I'd sell them a bit at a time and not all at once. Another person mentioned buying a brand new laptop to put the wallet onto - I think that is a MUST - as there is a decent chance that the computers you already own are infected with malware.

It can (just as any asset) act as a shelter against a currency devaluation, let me explain:
If they go off the Euro all those Euro denominated accounts will be converted into a new currency which will be worth less than the euro.  So at this point it's probably too late. Now if greeks converted their bank balances into gold, cash, btc, any other asset LAST WEEK they would have been able to effectively shelter their euro-denominated balances from any currency devaluation that may happen from now until when the banks reopen.

Yea I just sold a bunch of stuff and was shocked at how bad it has gotten.  They offer the option to sign up as a "store" and pay a monthly subscription fee - if you do that they drop the fee percentage.  The beauty of ebay was that everyone was on a level playing field, the big and small guys could coexist - but now they structured it so that the big stores pay less in fees that the small guys.  I can't wait for openbazaar to dethrone them.

It's impossible to know for sure, but estimates are around 500k to 2 million+ coins.

I feel like you are overestimating the ability of the market to price in bitcoin's potential.  How many bidders are there really?  Sure there are a bunch of neckbeard techies (maybe 50-100k at most) **who understand** the immense potential of the technology and see its true value.  But there are only so many of us and we have limited resources to bid the price up with.

Thanks for posting this, very thought provoking!  
My best solution is to implement some sort of decentralized p2p "watson" powered by a blockchain so that consensus could be recorded. Here's how it would work - Get a bunch of people running "watson" software on their computers (or maybe wolfram alpha-like software).  A question is posed to the network - this can be any question just like when watson plays jeopardy.
Every answer that your watson software submits must be accompanied by a small share of work, so in order to game the system you would need to have 51% of the "watson" hashing power. Each answer could be submitted to the network like transactions are submitted to the bitcoin network - once a "blockhash" was found (a hash with a difficulty breaching a given threshold) the block containing all of the answers could be incorporated into the blockchain.  The "correct" answer could be determined at at a given point in time based on the answer that occurs most frequently in the blockchain. All of the people submitting answers to the blockchain would be rewarded with a bit of "watsoncoin" - of course these coins must have some monetary value for the system to work.  Maybe you could even fuel the system by requiring a small "tnx fee" to submit a question.
Obviously the idea isn't completely fleshed out but I thought I'd give it a shot :)

Start of playing with small amounts until you get the hang of everything.  Always enable 2-factor authentification on websites that offer it.  If you want to buy a lot of bitcoin, use a technique called "dollar cost averaging" - essentially split your purchases into small chuncks and spread them out over time.  That way you spread out the risk a little as you don't go all in at one price.  That's about all I can think of :p 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-02 21:17:25

This is an interesting point that I don't see people mention very often.  Another factor here that adds natural deflation is mechanization and increasing production efficiency.  Every year it becomes cheaper and cheaper to produce things, factories and farms become more and more efficient. So logically the cost of all goods should be naturally decreasing every year as a reflection of this - but sadly inflation hides the production efficiency gains, so nobody knows what they are missing out on every year. Eventually the price of bitcoin will stabilize and the btc denominated cost of goods/services will have to drop every year to reflect the increase in productivity/natural deflation that is constantly occurring.

Copy/Paste of article:
Bitcoin prices have dropped almost 60% since January, outpacing the Russian ruble. Critics say that’s proof digital currency has failed.
Ignore them. Bitcoin’s price is irrelevant to the key question of whether the underlying technology will disrupt finance.  There are many signs it will.
Bitcoin is much more than just a currency. Investors from Silicon Valley to Wall Street are now pouring money and expertise into what they view as an adaptable technology platform. Software developers anywhere can use bitcoin’s open-source code to create specialized applications that let businesses undertake commercial exchanges without using middlemen. These applications threaten to make redundant many services provided by banks, foreign-exchange houses, escrow agents, clearing houses, notaries public and even lawyers.
Of course, none of that guarantees that bitcoin will succeed. Detractors will rightly argue that householders won’t save or transact in a unit of exchange whose value fluctuates wildly. Indeed, while bitcoin transactions continue to rise, and even though a growing list of merchants accepting bitcoin now includes Microsoft, Expedia EXPE +0.31% and Dish Network DISH +0.30%, digital currency’s portion of global commerce remains minuscule.
But it doesn’t matter that mom and pop aren’t comfortable with bitcoin. What matters is whether the exploding software innovation around cryptocurrency leads to solutions that allow corporations and governments to derive benefits while protecting themselves from risks, including the volatility. The vision that many in Silicon Valley have is that bitcoin, or perhaps some clone of it, will work in the background of the global economy. Mom and pop won’t even know it’s there.
Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in Menlo Park, Calif., likens bitcoin’s current status to the early days of Linux, whose open-source operating system initially sought to compete with Microsoft’s Windows on personal computers but eventually became the leading operating system for enterprise servers. Much like some bitcoin evangelists’ views of fiat currencies, early Linux supporters “were overconfidently saying, ‘We are going to kill Microsoft,’ and yet while it never got a much of a presence on desktops, it did gain a presence on the server side,” Mr. Srinivasan said. “Now, 15 years later, the Internet as we know it wouldn’t exist without Linux.”
Mr. Srinivasan talks of how a “dual boot” of Linux and Windows became popular as techies simultaneously tapped the best functions of both. It’s analogous, he says, to how cryptocurrency developers are making their applications “interoperable” with traditional monetary systems. Bitcoin, with its more efficient, direct and cheaper system of exchange, would support payments and transfers over the Internet and then connect seamlessly with the offline economy, where the dollar and other traditional currencies continued to reign.
Mr. Srinivasan’s firm, which was co-founded by Netscape pioneer Marc Andreessen, is one of dozens that have invested a total $311 million in bitcoin startups this year, according to a tally by news site Coindesk. That’s up from $93 million in 2013. The names behind these deals read like a who’s who of Internet history: Tim Draper of the Valley’s legendary Draper family, Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn fame, Yahoo YHOO -0.06% founder Jerry Yang and many others.
What gets these people excited is bitcoin’s “decentralized” infrastructure: the public, distributed ledger known as the blockchain, which is updated and maintained in real time by a network of independent computers to generate an ongoing consensus on the voracity of its data.
These computers are known as miners. While the new bitcoins they earn in return for maintaining the blockchain ledger can be metaphorically likened to freshly mined gold, the miners’ real work is to authenticate information. This vital role allows people and businesses that have no other way to trust each other to engage in commerce without the expensive intermediation of a third-party institution. It’s the first case of “decentralized trust” to challenge the hub-and-spokes “centralized” structure of international finance that was forged during the Renaissance by Florence’s Medici family.
Bitcoin’s fast, low-cost system for authenticating information not only makes it possible to make payments without fees going to credit card companies, banks, payment processors or exchange houses, but also to decentralize many other economic functions. Since any information can be embedded into the blockchain ledger and because the core software is an open platform, startups are building myriad “Bitcoin 2.0” applications based on the same principle: blockchain-based ride-sharing services, personal ID systems, database management and asset registries, even the wild idea of companies run not by human managers but by software programs.
Wall Street is in on the act, too. Senior investment bank managers are joining bitcoin startups. Hedge funds are trading digital currencies. Ex-traders are building high-tech platforms and derivatives to better manage digital currency’s volatility. Bitcoin’s price is now quoted on Bloomberg terminals. Some banks are using Ripple Labs’ cryptocurrency network for international transfers. Some Federal Reserve district banks are looking at how the technology might streamline the Fed’s interbank payments system.
Meanwhile, the British, Mexican and other governments are studying blockchain solutions to enhance economic transparency.
Excessive government regulation could also strangle cryptocurrency, of course. But smart regulation could legitimize it. Last week, New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky unveiled details for a revised “BitLicense” that was welcomed by many in the bitcoin community for promoting innovation.
These are the developments that matter, not the roller coaster of bitcoin’s price.

I understand that, and I agree with your assessment of the current situation - I just wanted to point out that we are hitting the 1MB cap *now*, it's not some mythical limit that we *might* hit *someday*. I know 4k unconfirmed transactions is not a big deal, but if the price spikes like it did in Nov '13, we could be sitting on 500k unconfirmed transactions which would be a clusterfuck PR nightmare. I can just imagine the NYTimes articles now:  "bitcoin is broken" "transactions delayed for days" "5% transaction fees - worse than credit cards", etc etc.

Well they are not "waiting for a good price" when they are buying BTC either.
If I buy five apples from you for rubles, then sell them to someone else for USD, has this transaction affected the apple market?  All this would do is drive down the price of rubles (slightly), drive up the price of USD (slightly), and would be neutral for apples.  (technically would be slightly positive for apples because there would be a small amount of time in which the person is holding apples and taking it out of supply)

I can't see why? Unless you actually wanted to mine on mars I don't see why there would be an issue sending/receiving bitcoin to and from mars.  Basically someone on mars could just create a transaction, beam it to earth - once it reaches earth it will be broadcast on the network.  The blocks can be beamed back to mars whenever they are created.  Mining blocks on mars would be impossible of course without 51% of the network hashing power. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:23:40
Yes, that is exactly right - all SHA256 mining hardware would be worthless after the fork. They would only continue mining if it was profitable to do so, which would be unlikely in such a scenario.

2) this is completely besides the point of this thread, but to address your post above:


A **total** of 5.3 trillion worth of currencies (**all currencies not just dollars**) are traded every day so you would need to compare that value to the total value of all currencies on the planet, not just USD - which is of course way more than 10.5T!!

Andreas has dispelled this argument many times. If there is a real 51% attack we can simply hardfork the network and switch to a new algo, rendering all SHA256 mining equipment useless. This would of course only happen under extreme circumstances which I never expect to play out, but we DO have an obvious and effective counter to such an attack.

This statement suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of how the blockchain functions.  


They don't need the cooperation of ANY miners - miners have no say in the matter.  The core devs just need to release a hardfork update, and new blocks would be incorporated by people mining the new algo, whatever that is. The SHA256 miners could of course could continue to mine the old (worthless) SHA256 fork if they wanted to. 
A majority of the miners can stall the "orthodox" fork of the blockchain and include all transactions in the new fork
If the algo is changed, SHA256 miners would no longer be able to include blocks after the hard fork so they would have no say in which transactions were included.

It's not really practical to mine bitcoins with normal computer hardware anymore, it requires special bitcoin mining computers (asics).  Storing bitcoins can get complicated.  If you have just a little bit I would keep it on coinbase or some other easy to use web wallet.  If you have more then you can look into Armory or Trezor.  You can use armory on a non-networked PC, while Trezor is a hardware wallet specifically designed to store bitcoin securely.  You can back up these in several ways, usually a hard copy printed backup is created that ensures you can re-create you wallet even if your HDD fails.

3 of 5 - two with relatives, one in your safe at home, one each in two different safe deposit boxes.  This removes the risk of relatives conspiring.  Pretty much every risk is reduced to zero.  Maybe someone can break into 3 houses simultaneously, but even then they would need to crack the safe etc. before you discover theft and move the coins.  The biggest risk is really a hostage/torture type situation where they get the password out of you by force.

my changetip dashboard shows 1,015,576 bits given away (so a bit over 1 BTC), and they've processed a total of 6,478 tips from me.  Not all of those were individual people, and not all were from that giveaway thread.  Also I'd guess each person was tipped by 2 people on average (not just me) - and some of these people were tipping more than me.
Altogether I'd guess about 6,000 redditors were tipped in the thread, an average of about 20 cents each. :)

Can you provide a better example of how mining centralization is dangerous to the bitcoin network?  Your example of a large datacenter going down is pretty weak. Honestly I don't see why it would matter much. Even if something catastrophic happened, and 50% of all mining hardware went down at once (this would require an epic event, maybe a solar flare or catastrophic earthquake that knocks out power to all of East-Asia) - that would only mean block times would rise to 20 minutes for a few days... In the grand scheme of things **even with** a continent-wide catastrophic failure of infrastructure, the bitcoin network would be (barely) affected.  That's why everyone assumes when people talk about the dangers of mining centralization they are referring to a 51% attack, the other consequences of centralization pale in comparison.

That's like asking why everyone didn't sell at the peak of $475 - the obvious answer is that most people didn't expect the price to tank.  Nobody could have predicted that whale buyer would stop buying at $475 and not $425 or $575.  Nobody knows where the price will be tomorrow or in 1 week or in 1 month, it's just impossible to predict by looking at the chart.  Yes someone could have sold yesterday and made money.  But the price could have just as easily increased if bullwhale showed up again. Unless you own a time machine, there is no reliable way to predict the future price by looking at a chart.

An HD wallet generates many addresses from a single seed.  Is it possible for someone to tell that two addresses were generated by the same seed?  Thus, if I store my coins at many different addresses all generated by the same key - is it possible for someone to figure out my real BTC net worth by seeing that they were all generated by the same seed somehow?  Thanks in advance.

I listen to him daily (back when the radio show was still around) and I've never heard him say anything that made me think he didn't understand the technology behind bitcoin.  He actually has a pretty good understanding of it all.  He just argues that 1) it's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, 2) it's not backed by anything and has little/no intrinsic value (like gold has because it has other uses) 3) anyone can make a new currency which may dilute it's value.  All of these are good points, I think most of us just think that the pros far outweigh these issues.

up means the currency is losing value relative to USD :)
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:11:25


This would only be the case if there is some friction in converting RUR to USD, which I don't believe is the case.  As long as you can easily convert RUR to USD, if the BTC/RUR price began to rise arbitrage traders could easily step in and fix the imbalance by selling BTC for RUR and immediately converting to USD and buying back on the BTC/USD market.  This is why I don't think you would see the RUR/BTC market rise faster than USD/BTC (after normalizing for RUR/USD).


If there is oversupply the price would be in perpetual freefall until the price reached a point where supply and demand met.


Clearly some russians are turning to BTC to hedge against a fall in the Ruble (this much is clear from the chart), the reason the Ruble fall alone is not moving BTC higher is because the  volume just isn't there yet, with only 100 BTC purchased per day from russian localbitcoins this is not able to move the global market much.  If the trend continues though maybe in a few months volume will be at 300-500 coins per day and it will start having a more pronounced effect on the global BTC price.

You must register with fincen as a MSB and with your state as a money transmitter (except SC and NM which have no money transmitter laws).  Of course so far nobody has been prosecuted for not following the law, but this could change at some point in the future, at which point they could theoretically go after people retroactively.  It's super lame I know... It's also virtually impossible to register as a money transmitter, the requirements are ATROCIOUS.

Sure, it is possible... but are you 100% sure that this would happen?  I am not arguing that it is certain, **just that  it is a non-negligible possibility!** 


This is a very bad argument. Hard drives will grow in size, likely much faster than the size of the blockchain.  And even if the blockchain grows faster than hard drives, who cares if a normal DESKTOP COMPUTER can't hold the blockchain - it means nothing for the future of bitcoin. All that matters is that mining pool operators have the hardware to hold the blockchain, I highly doubt this will ever be a major problem.  


Nobody cares if grandma uses bitcoin, we are talking about using it as a world reserve currency (USD is the world reserve currency which means foreign governments hold USD in their vaults), not a national currency. Of course it can also be used in everyday transactions, but that is not really what we are talking about here.

That is incredibly easy to do. 
Edit: This is how I would do it. 1) Create private keys and encrypt them in a truecrypt container. 2) stash this encrypted file a few different places IRL and on the internet. 3) Use tor and a tumbler to deposit coins to these addresses. There's no way they would be able to prove in court that you were in possession of anything - even if they found "encrypted files" on your computer they would have no idea what addresses were yours or how many addresses you controlled. Alternatively you could use Electrum and you wouldn't even have to bother with the encrypted files, you could just memorize the 12 word seed.

Sadly I have to agree with this statement.  I expect the first application of bitcoin to gain true widespread adoption will "hide" the bitcoin aspect in the background, people will think they are transacting with fiat but are infact using bitcoin. They will use this future application because it is cheaper or more convenient, not because it has anything to do with bitcoin.  It's just human nature, most people are not inquisitive.  They want to know only what they need to know to get by.

Here's my theory: LBC volume is mostly coming from end-users that will actually be buying stuff with bitcoin, this activity is increasing at a steady pace with little regard for the BTC price. Meanwhile the other exchanges are mostly catering to traders, and the more stable the price the less volume you will see from the true traders. Once volatility picks up exchange volume will rise concomitantly.  Meanwhile LBC volume will continue upwards unabated.

I think Peter is a great guy, I agree with him on virtually everything.  Hell, I even subscribe to his paid podcast and listen to him almost every day because I value his opinion so much.  That having been said, I completely disagree with him on bitcoin. 
It's not that he doesn't understand bitcoin, he *does* have a good grasp of the technology, the problem is that in Peter's mind, the ONLY money that can ever work is gold (or is backed by gold), therefore he fails to see the potential of bitcoin because it is not backed by gold (or some other hard asset).  Peter elevates Bitcoins "lack of gold backing" to such a high level that it is the **only thing** he considers when determining the value of the currency.  
So why does he think gold is more valuable than bitcoin (or anything else for that matter). The main reason that he gives is that the value of gold hinges on the fact that gold has "intrinsic value" - ie it can be used to *make things* (jewelry, tooth fillings, electronics, and he believes this "intrinsic value" is the reason why gold is valued in our society.  **The problem with his assessment is that "intrinsic value" is not why gold is valuable**.  
If anything, gold has very little real use, it can definitely be argued that gold is one of the least important metals on the periodic table if you define its worth by its usefulness in making things (hell I have plenty of fillings and they are all ceramic - I bought my girlfriend a fancy new ring (it was platinum!). The real reason gold has value is that **people believe it has value**, and they **believe** it will continue to have value in the future, this causes people to hold gold, make jewelry out of gold, etc.  **This alone** is the reason gold is valued at $1300 per oz and not $13 per oz.  If people failed to believe it was valuable, and it was only priced by its "intrinsic value" as a metal used in fillings and electronics etc., it would be worth $13 per oz, because it's just **not that important** as an industrial metal. 
Now you understand why Peter doesn't like bitcoin. He admits that he does like that BTC shares some characteristics with gold (ie fungible, limited supply etc), but in his mind golds characteristics of "useful in making things and physical not digital" &gt;(are greater than) bitcoins advantages of "higher divisibility, impossible to counterfeit, instantly transferred, no transaction fees, no vault fees, completely borderless, completely transparent supply, much lower conversion fees (USD&lt;&gt;BTC vs USD&lt;&gt;Gold), easier to transact etc. etc. etc."  
Essentially, it my view he is misjudging why gold is valuable in the first place, which leads to his dismissiveness about bitcoin.  Gold is valuable because people believe it is valuable, and BTC is valuable because people believe it is valuable. That's all it boils down to. Having said that, I think eventually Peter will come around to these facts and warm up to bitcoin eventually.

Well as far as the gold ETFs go, from what I read they actually own physical gold at 100% the net worth of the fund.  This is how they are able to ensure the ETF tracks the price of gold so precisely.  That goes for any ETF as far as I am aware.  An S&amp;P500 ETF actually holds shares in all of the 500 companies of the S&amp;P500 for example. If they own less than 100% of the assets then the ETF will not be able to track that asset class precisely.

Just wanted to throw this out there, but I highly doubt that coinbase is tracking coins used on darknet markets (because it is nearly impossible to tell that an address is owned by a drug dealer).

The spot price IS the real price, it represents current supply vs. current demand. You are right that adoption has barely begun, but I bet if there were no investors/speculators the price would be around $5 not $300 as you suggest.  Of course the speculators and investors see the potential, and have bid the price up to $400. Just because speculators have bid the price up, doesn't mean it is not a real price.

You can do a "cash advance" up to your credit card's max spending limit.  This would be preferable to just doing a normal cash advance on your card because usually the interest rate on purchases is much lower than the rate on cash advances, and they usually only let you cash advance a small portion of the spending limit, not the whole amount.

I think Peter is a great guy, I agree with him on virtually everything.  Hell, I even subscribe to his paid podcast and listen to him almost every day because I value his opinion so much.  That having been said, I completely disagree with him on bitcoin. 
It's not that he doesn't understand bitcoin, he *does* have a good grasp of the technology, the problem is that in Peter's mind, the ONLY money that can ever work is gold (or is backed by gold), therefore he fails to see the potential of bitcoin because it is not backed by gold (or some other hard asset).  Peter elevates Bitcoins "lack of gold backing" to such a high level that it is the **only thing** he considers when determining the value of the currency.  
So why does he think gold is more valuable than bitcoin (or anything else for that matter). The main reason that he gives is that the value of gold hinges on the fact that gold has "intrinsic value" - ie it can be used to *make things* (jewelry, tooth fillings, electronics, and he believes this "intrinsic value" is the reason why gold is valued in our society.  **The problem with his assessment is that "intrinsic value" is not why gold is valuable**.  
If anything, gold has very little real use, it can definitely be argued that gold is one of the least important metals on the periodic table if you define its worth by its usefulness in making things (hell I have plenty of fillings and they are all ceramic - I bought my girlfriend a fancy new ring (it was platinum!). The real reason gold has value is that **people believe it has value**, and they **believe** it will continue to have value in the future, this causes people to hold gold, make jewelry out of gold, etc.  **This alone** is the reason gold is valued at $1300 per oz and not $13 per oz.  If people failed to believe it was valuable, and it was only priced by its "intrinsic value" as a metal used in fillings and electronics etc., it would be worth $13 per oz, because it's just not that important as an industrial metal. 
Now you understand why Peter doesn't like bitcoin. He admits that he does like that BTC shares some characteristics with gold (ie fungible, limited supply etc), but in his mind golds characteristics of "useful in making things and physical not digital" &gt;(are greater than) bitcoins advantages of "higher divisibility, impossible to counterfeit, instantly transferred, no transaction fees, no vault fees, completely borderless, completely transparent supply, much lower conversion fees (USD&lt;&gt;BTC vs USD&lt;&gt;Gold), easier to transact etc. etc. etc."  
Essentially, in my view he is misjudging why gold is valuable in the first place, which leads to his dismissiveness about bitcoin. Gold is valuable because people believe it is valuable, and BTC is valuable because people believe it is valuable. That's all it boils down to. Having said that, I think eventually Peter will come around to these facts and warm up to bitcoin, but it may take some time.

I don't think governments will ever be able to technologically restrict it. But  I do think (and this is my biggest fear) that governments may put such harsh penalties on bitcoin use or exchange that nobody would dare risk being caught.  This is undoubtedly their most effective tool to quash bitcoin.  At the moment I think they just plain don't understand the threat bitcoin poses to the state.  If they knew that bitcoin may prevent them from printing fiat in the future, I think they would come down on it like a bag of bricks before it gains a foothold.  All we can really do is hope they don't come to this realization before bitcoin is so mainstream that they wouldn't dare try to stop it.

That's just the address that blockchain.info happened to receive the broadcast from first.  So, you broadcast it, it hops through a bunch of nodes, X, Y, Z and  finally reaches blockchain.info they record the transaction coming from node Z.  This is confusing, but just know that the IP shown in blockchain.info is rarely the IP that actually broadcasted the transaction originally.  Also there are no IPs actually listed in the blockchain, that is all within blockchain.info. 
Edit: just reading more about this, it seems that a persistent motivated attacker could run a bunch of full nodes - connecting to all of the other nodes on the network, which would make it easier to potentially link your transactions to an IP.  To be extra careful (if you care about this sort of thing) you can route your traffic through tor or i2p.

Bots and walls and whales are not necessarily manipulating the market. Bots work the spread mostly, whales place buy/sell walls to accumulate or unwind large positions at a fair price instead of reaching into the order book. I watch the markets often and I can't say I've ever seen anything to suggest manipulation. There's no evidence to suggest that the price we see represents nothing more than supply vs demand.

The reward is effectively pinned at 5 coins per block due to the the large increase in the effectiveness of the x11 mining software. The price would have to drop to 1/5th of the current marketcap in order to drive the block reward to anything greater than 5. Plus the likelyhood of this scenario playing out becomes even more remote every time a new more efficient x11 miner comes out.

Just because you can divide something into smaller units doesn't make that asset any more or less scarce.  That's like saying gold isn't scarce because you can divide it into tiny little flakes.

No wonder we are not on the same page.  :)
Miners **DO NOT NEED TO REACH CONSENSUS** to switch algos.  Even if 100% of the SHA256 miners are against the decision to switch algos, the **ALGO SWITCH CAN CONTINUE UNDETERRED**. They can continue to mine the old (worthless) fork if they so choose. The only people that actually matter - the ones that need to agree to the switch are the  Bitcoin Core Devs, wallet developers, payment service providers, exchanges, and most importantly THE INVESTORS which will determine the VALUE of the coins on the NEW vs the OLD fork. I am happy to continue this conversation, I have thought extensively about this scenario and can answer any questions you have.

Excellent review - there was another person that deserves credit that you didn't mention. The day after the tipping spree in - created a giveaway in that got 6k replies.  He crossposted to which was key to driving people into the post.  Sadly the mods of removed his crosspost after about 2 hours claiming that "non-physical items" belong in not This was a crucial blow, dramatically reducing traffic to the thread. 
I saw how amazing the crosspost worked (until that day I had never heard of so I decided to do another tipping thread. This time I crossposted in and made an argument in the comments section that bitcoin belongs in because it can be printed and kept as a paper wallet - so it CAN take physical form.  Thankfully one of the mods sided with my argument and tagged the thread with "MOD Approved" - The crosspost sat at the top of for more than 12 hours and this was the main driver of people into the thread.  
I chose to post in a new sub  because some people in were  complaining about tipping posts not being quality content and I didn't think another giveaway thread would be well received.  So initial thread was crucial and he deserves a pat on the back. :)
While I have your attention - [the 18k comment thread]( in has NO EXPIRATION - that way we can continue to link to it on social media and whoever is awake at that timezone can help fill tips. We've had at least a dozen active tippers in that thread, and it is STILL going strong.  I have no intention of ever taking the post down - please stop by tip/answer questions if you have time.

I use both, have about 1/3 of my coins on a trezor and the other 2/3 with armory on dedicated (armory only) online and offline computers running ubuntu. I've never heard of anyone getting coins stolen with either setup, but I store more on armory because I have an m-of-n backup, so even if someone were to gain access to a couple of my armory seed backups they wouldn't be able to access the coins.

It's interesting to think that bitcoin's true marketcap is much lower than people assume because these zombie coins (~3 million?) will probably never be circulated again. So instead of a 7.7B marketcap, bitcoin is actually ~5.4B.  Great read.

Yes, I have invested in alts in the past.  If fact I have inadvertently  created some of those "pumps" by taking large positions, and have watched the newbies in bitcointalk.org blame it on manipulation.  If a whale gets excited about coin X, and drops 50-100 BTC on it, it can easily drive the price up momentarily.  Hell, sometimes there are even bandwagoners that buy on the uptrend. As for the recent BTC price spike.  The most likely explanation IMO, is that a large mystery buyer bought what appears to be ~30-50k coins on OKCoin over a 2 day span, then stopped buying.  The momentum obviously fizzled once the buying stopped, the market started to turn over, people panicked and, and the price fell.  It's the exact same pattern that happens over and over again in the alt markets when whales move into or out of positions.

If you insist on buying on coinbase I  suggest withdrawing it from coinbase and depositing it in another exchange, something like cryptsy.com or poloniex.com, then sending it to the gambling site. This extra step ensures that your coins are "washed clean" and cannot be traced by coinbase. Alternatively you can mix the coins with a coin-mixing service like bitblender. Either of these routes will make it impossible for coinbase to figure out where the coins went.

Ok, just to be clear.  Lets say the normal blockchain is A, the cartel blockchain is B.  What would occur is the core devs (gavin andressen et al) would implement a new algo via a software update and hardfork.  This would mean that a new version of chain A would exist after the hardfork lets call that chain C.  This chain would only be minable via the new algo.  So the cartel cannot add blocks to this chain, only chains A and B in your example.

Nah, I think it would be a step in the right direction.  Instead of a bunch of shitty small companies and exchanges holding tons of bitcoin for people - they could store that coin with an institution that has real assets and actually has the funds and insurance to pay people back if they are ever hacked. Anyone who wanted to hold it themselves could still do that.

Nope, we cannot inflate the supply.  If you own 1 bitcoin you own 1/21millionth of all of the bitcoin that will ever exist, the supply can never be expanded.  Of course you can divide that bitcoin into 100 million tiny pieces, but each of those pieces will never be worth more that 1/100millionth of a bitcoin. Hope that makes sense :)

Yep, so if you are withdrawing 5 cents from changetip and don't care if you get the coins immediately you can pay .3 cents.  If you are transferring money oversees to a child in need of cash ASAP, you have the option to increase your fee to 3 cents to be sure that it gets incorporated into the next block.  Sounds like an ok compromise to me.

Nowadays it's harder to lose coins this way, the wallet keeps 100 addresses queued up in a key pool, so you only need to re-backup the wallet.dat after 100 addresses have been used, not 1.

All tipping via Changetip occurs off-chain - but of course the withdrawals/deposits to changetip are on-chain and are contributing to the transaction volume increase. It's hard to say to what extent though.

You are essentially on the right track.  If you want to see mixing done correctly check out Darkcoin.  Essentially what they do is break every input into a bunch of denominated fragments, and send coins through the mixing process with a bunch of other coins from other individuals.  They do this 8 times (8 separate wash cycles), and the coins come out clean ("anonymized") at the other end.  Once they are clean they can be spent at any time in the future and anonymity is maintained.

This number is meaningless in this discussion - forex traders make massively leveraged trades to profit off of small percentage swings in currencies. On top of enormous leverage, the same dollar can change hands hundreds of times during a trading session, That's the only reason why the number is so large.

I wouldn't call heavily investing in something that you truly believe in dumb.  Sure, maybe if you are nearing retirement and are expecting to draw on the money soon maybe crypto isn't the best place to in invest, but investing heavily in something you truly believe in (especially when you are young) is only natural. Elon Musk comes to mind. Sure it is risky and you don't want to place all of your eggs in one basket, but sometimes you have to follow your intuition and take risks in life.
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:59:56


It would only be a bad thing in the short run -  because it would make people that already own homes "feel" less wealthy. In reality they wouldn't have lost anything, they started with a home, they end with a home. Lower home prices would be a great achievement for any society (and should be the goal imo) because that means *everyone* would have to work fewer hours to satisfy one of life's necessities - shelter.  They could spend that time/money on something else.

The difference between localbitcoins and the other exchanges: the people buying on localbitcoins are end users.  These people want to buy BTC without the KYC requirements (probably a lot of darknet users), and they're willing to pay 5-10% *above* market value to get the coins. This is real demand that actually means something - "volume" on any other exchange is a mostly useless metric because the same coins can exchange hands many times per day and artificially drive the volume metrics.

Paycoin is built on a series of empty promises.  ie. pay us USD and we will let you mine our proprietary coin (paycoin) and you can sell it back to us for $20 minimum because the company will set a floor on the price.  Obvious scam is obvious.

If the ETF attracts billions of new wall st. dollars (which is what most people expect), the price could easily go to 10k or more.  Just look at the orderbook as it currently stands.  If someone went into the market and tried to buy even 500M USD worth of bitcoin it would drive the price up to 5k or more. Of course there will be people that sell as the price rises, but there will also be bandwagoners that buy on the way up as well.  The point is, the market depth right now is extremely shallow, if there is a sudden influx of cash, possibly 5-10 billion or more could rush in with the ETF, it would not be surprising to me if the price (at least temporarily) spiked to 10k or more.

This is what every non-US government in the world does currently.  They hold USD in their vaults and give only their national currency legal tender status.  So if/when the US Dollar fails and there is a currency crisis, they will move to something else to hold in reserves.  euros, yuan, gold, etc or some combination of those seem like obvious choices.  Another possibility is that they hold (at least a small portion) of their reserves in bitcoin, if it has proven to be a reliable store of value by that future date.

I feel like using the term liquidity here is a bad idea - liquidity already has a definition in finance - a measure of how much the market will move when buying/selling an amount of something.  When they talk about 10-20% liquidity that is going to mislead people into thinking this metric has something to do with the liquidity of the btc market, when I think you were only referencing zombie coins (correct?).

I disagree that these are baseless claims. Darkcoin underwent a thorough security review by security expert Kristov Atlas, he published a 20 page whitepaper of his findings.

You are right it is still closed source (will be open source very soon though, maybe as early as next week) - you are wrong though about needing to see the source to determine whether it can be deanonymized or not.  Just look at the mixing occurring on the blockchain, it cannot be deanonymized.

As someone else pointed out, the colors on the bars do not indicate if the orders are initiated by buyers or sellers, it indicates whether the bitstamp price has risen or fallen during that time.  The VAST majority of activity on localbitcoins is people buying bitcoin above spot price to use/hoard.  I am a LBC buyer/seller - although I have both buy and sell ads, only 1 person (out of well over 100 trades) has ever sold me bitcoin.  In an effort to entice people to sell me their BTC I set my sell price at 3% below spot while my buy is 9% above spot.  Still have only had 1 person sell me BTC.

Well, I pretty much in agreement with you - I am heavily invested in BTC because I know it could easy to move away from POW towards a hybrid POS/POW or full POS model if a true govt 51% threat occurred or was threatened.  


I don't think they (the decision makers in congress and the fed) really understand the implications of BTC and virtual currencies in general.  Bitcoin (and/or other virtual currencies) WILL supplant the dollar eventually, I would bet my fortune on it.  If they truly understood the threat virtual currencies are going to pose to the current system of fiat currency and fractional reserve banking, I think they would be pushing for a complete ban and/or maybe even attempt to attack the infrastructure.  I think they (the white haired men running the country) will wake up eventually (probably once the dollar starts to crash and BTC breaks 1T marketcap) but by then it will be too late to stop it. Even if they started now - it's probably too late to stop it.

Bitcoin tumblers are your best option - alternatively you can create an account at an exchange (such as cryptsy.com), deposit funds and then withdraw funds, this process will be similar to tumbling the coins (although cryptsy can de-anonymize the transactions).  
Another even more anonymous way would be to deposit btc at an exchange, buy an altcoin (darkcoin would be a good option as you can use the protocol to mix the coins), then take that and send it to another exchange, sell it back for BTC and withdraw BTC.  You will lose around 2-5% doing it this way on the spread + exchange fees.

His conclusions are dubious at best IMO. I'll go through them one at a time.
 &gt;because of the large dip in prices over the past year, most tokens are inactive in part because the owners are still “underwater”
It's impossible to tell from these charts *why* coins have become inactive, just *that* they have become inactive.  Maybe people are accumulating coins and moving them to cold storage?  That's what I've been doing over this period.


The data is completely agnostic to this "conclusion" - this statement may have merit, but these charts provide no evidence to confirm or deny this claim


What?  These graphs don't even address "on-chain activity" or the number of users that are using bitcoin for payment. We know that transaction volume is increasing over this period (payment processors bitpay and coinbase have confirmed this on many occasions), so it must be that the same coins are being spent multiple times per month.


This of course is also *not* a conclusion drawn from these charts. To address his point, yes of course there are more miners than are needed to securely maintain the blockchain - this is because we are in the distribution phase.. Does there need to be a 25 coin per block reward to secure the blockchain? Of course not. Satoshi did this to distribute a large number of coins in these early years, this is bitcoin working as intended.


Again, this is a function of the number of transactions *not* the % of coins that are active which is what these charts represent.  Hell, in the future maybe only 1% of coins would need to be active in any given month - if the velocity was high enough to generate enough transaction fees to incentivize miners, that is all that matters.

In the last two days stocks are down, USD is down, gold is up, but bitcoin is down?  Seems weird I would expect bitcoin correlate more with gold and to rise with a falling dollar. 
I've seen others suggesting in various threads that BTC may have fallen yesterday as a result of some of the secondmarket investors taking profits (assuming they won the auction below market value).  This could explain the odd price behavior.

Hi, thanks for the effort you put into making these - just a couple quick comments nit-picking your syntax.  First, you are using the phrase "public key" where you mean to say "public address" - You get the address by hashing the public key.  Second, you reference the "size of a public key".  Technically the size of all public keys is identical, you mean to say something like - "The amount of coins stored at an address". Again, thanks for your hard work, very interesting visualization :)

I don't know why coinbase gets a pass, maybe because they have a strict Anti-money laundering/Know your customer policy.  I'm sure it's something they worked out with their lawyers. And of course they are registered with the feds and hold a money tramsitter license in every state.  In contrast, there was a small shop called "Cash for bitcoins" in virginia.  All they did was buy bitcoin for cash, they got shut down by the state of VA for running an unregistered money transmission business.

Yes that is exactly right.  The decision to upgrade to the new chain is of course up to each individual to decide, but if such a terrible threat to the network ever occurred as you describe, the choice would be obvious which chain to go with. And of course the markets would decide how much value the coins generated on each of these chains would have, so that would of course sway people to one chain or another.

I'm actually surprised it's not higher.  I suspect these charts mostly just reflect the measures taken to store coins. ie. It's more secure to set up cold storage once, and not touch those coins again until it's absolutely necessary. 
For example, I've had 95% of my coins in cold storage for &gt;6 months, I transact with the other 5%.   I suspect exchanges work similarly - they have layers of cold storage. Some layers of cold storage have not been moved for years and only a small number of coins are kept in hot wallets - these "high velocity" coins move around frequently and represent most of the transactions on the blockchain.

So basically darkcoin is bad because the mixers are paid by the block reward?  How is that a drawback?  If anything it seems like a positive as it ablates mixing fees.  
Your other point about mixers being able to associate inputs and outputs is a valid point but all coinjoin implemetations have this problem - DRK has solved this issue though by routing all transactions through 8 separate randomly selected mixing nodes.

Nope - I don't trust myself to remember a passphrase, and I don't think anyone should.  There should ALWAYS be a paper backup somewhere, this is especially crucial if you were to die, your family would have no way to access the coins without a written record. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 18:19:00
Well, there are a few reasons. Most importantly - BTC is a fixed supply currency (the only in the world).  Unlike all national currencies it cannot be inflated endlessly at the stroke of a pen.  I think this is powerful and eventually BTC will act as a safe-haven investment (similar to gold) because of this property. I don't know when the next bubble will come, it is definitely hard to predict.  My guess would be within 3-5 years time. 
As for evidence - End-user demand for coin [continues to rise]( darknet market use [continues to rise]( lots of venture capital money is flowing into startups that give bitcoin utility, merchant adoption continues to grow, no other crypto has emerged that looks like it can rival bitcoin, governments are largely complacent. Just a few reasons I am optimistic about the future.

You do realize that under a sustained 51% attack all bitcoin becomes worthless right? Of course that means all mining equipment is also worthless... The miners having to scrap their equipment is essentially the least-worst solution that would save bitcoin.  Assuming miners also own coins, don't you think they would rather salvage the value of the coins than watch the coins AND their equipment become worthless? 
Your concerns about the community "recovering" from this "disaster" - I'm not even sure how to respond.  The only people suffering losses would be miners, everyone else would be thankful that BTC didn't die completely. The network wouldn't take years to recover, it would "recover" in a matter of hours to days.  Instead of 40k Asics securing the network, it would be 200k GPUs, which in all honesty is probably MORE secure than the centralized asic farms.

That is why transactions will be routed through multiple random masternodes.  As long as even just one of the masternodes is clean the anonymity is maintained.  It is "trustless" in the sense that it is impossible for masternodes to steal coins (something that can't be said for bitcoin tumblers)

It's impossible to say - my guess is probably about 20-30% of the coins are held by chinese.
A couple quick points:
1) Chinese exchanges have very high volume because they don't charge fees for placing trades, so people buy/sell very quickly which inflates the volume. 
2)The best guess for coins permanently lost is about 5-10%.  If you count satoshi's coins (maybe lost maybe not) that would be 15-20%

Yep, I use the fragmented backup 3 of 5.  You can make it essentially impossible for anyone to get at the keys if you keep them geographically separated.  You can even keep a couple of the keys in safe deposit boxes to be extra careful. The best part about armory is you can actually spend from a cold wallet too!

Yea I looked into the hashlet thing, it looked like a blatant ponzi scheme.  It's not even clear that the miners even exist from what I can tell. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't even point these cloud miners to a pool, you have to use one of their "proprietary pools" so you don't even know if any real hashing is going on.  Does GAW find any bitcoin blocks ever?  I watch blockchain.info quite often and have never seen a GAW block.  I am kind of ignorant on this so if I am offbase here someone please correct me.

I bought two cheap laptops ($200 each) from bestbuy and a cheap printer, along with half a dozen clean USB drives - I installed ubuntu linux 14.04 on both laptops from a single USB drive (checked the hash first before installing). Then connected one to the internet - downloaded armory, verified checksum, downloaded a couple armory dependencies that are needed for the offline computer, moved all of that to a clean USB drive. Then I used this USB drive to install armory (offline) and dependencies on the offline laptop - generated m-of-n keys and printed them on the offline printer. Then intsalled a watch-only wallet on the online laptop to watch balances.  Then sent some coin to the wallet to test, practiced generating spends from the online laptop and signing on the offline laptop.  Once I was confident that everything was working properly, and I had distributed m-of-n keys to various locations/trusted parties - I moved the majority of the coins.  This video helped me make sure I was doing everything correctly:  
I also keep some coins on a trezor to help spread the risk somewhat.

Pretty simple calculation:
Given a 10 min block time, there is a 50% chance of finding a block every 5 minutes - over a 6 hour time there are 72 "chances" to find a block. 
.5^72 = .0000000000000000000212% = chance of there being a 6 hour space between any two blocks
said another way this should only happen one time every 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696 blocks
So this makes me wonder how the hell it happened in the first place!?

You create transactions with a hot computer with a watch-only wallet, then bring them to your cold wallet computer  (this wallet is encrypted of course) to sign the transaction.  Then bring it back to the hot computer to broadcast the signed transaction.  Armory makes this process really seamless.  The 3-of-5 I mentioned earlier was for making the wallet backup, not multisig.

Of course this is very interesting, but it doesn't explain why they would want to imbed asics into chips to *mine bitcoin*.  Using chips to remotely compute is a great idea, it's been attempted by many companies and nonprofits, but why would it help to build a *bitcoin miner* into the chip itself?  Why wouldn't you just make small program that runs in the background like seti and then pay out in bitcoin?  **Why the asic?**

Yes this is very relevant to tipping.  It means that the typical 100 bit transaction fee is outdated and will be soon replaced en mass by a 10 bit fee. This is important for on-blockchain tipping and withdrawing small amounts from places like changetip.

On a related note - Most people don't know this but American sellers on localbitcoins ARE (sadly) breaking the law as currently written.  I used to be a high volume trader but stopped once I figured out what the laws are.  From my reading: ALL US sellers on local bitcoins must me registered with the federal gov't/fincen as a money services business (MSB) in order to operate legally.  The law is very clear on this point and addresses virtual currencies specifically in the law.  On the state level, most states also require you to register as a money transmitter (this process is extremely expensive and difficult by the way). There are only 2 states that don't have money transmitter laws (SC, NM) 
TLDR: ALL Localbitcoins traders are breaking federal law as it is currently written unless they have registered as a money services business!

Unfortunately because Dash uses a masternode network (which shares in the block reward) this would be next to impossible to replicate within bitcoin without adjusting the btc incentive structure. It could potentially be implemented as a sidechain though


It was not premined, but due to an oversight in the initial launch code the difficulty took forever to re-adjust higher and the early miners made out like bandits. It's unclear how many coins the dev was able to mine, even if he had mined 100% of the blocks during those first days it would still put his share under 10% of max supply (not 30%). It's unlikely he was able to mine more than 2-3% of the max supply, and given the amount of effort he has put into the project over the last 2 years I don't think anyone should be upset if he holds a lot of coins.

He brings up a great point about kids that want to buy stuff like games and apps and such - which currently requires a credit card.  Bitcoin could be really useful in that setting.  
Just think - every time you hand your kid a credit card to buy an app or whatever, you are exposing yourself to all sorts of risks.  Eg. what if the kid accidentally signs up for a subscription, buys something expensive either accidentally or purposely, enters the CC# into a shady site, etc..  Wouldn't it be great if instead of giving your kid your creditcard - you could just give him $10 of digital cash instead?  That way they can buy whatever they want and there is no worry about exposing your credit card to all of these things?  Plus you don't need to act like a lame helocopter-parent every time the creditcard comes out for an online purchase.

Of course there would still be some bids, they would just be super shallow.  They probably were super shallow, but I can't remember to be honest. I think Guitarbits is right though, bitstamp hit a wall - volume plunged and the price lagged behind the other exchanges massively - it appeared as though people couldn't get dollars into the exchange fast enough. There's really no other explanation.  I was watching all of the markets and it appeared the vast majority of the buying pressure was coming from OKCoin (probably a single large whale), the arbitrage traders on the other exchanges were doing their best to try to keep up but were unable to.  The key factor is how quickly they can move fiat from OKCoin to the other exchanges, and the answer must have been - not fast enough.

It's sort of funny because the description you post proves that you are wrong.  If two blocks are generated at the same time and propagate equally well through the network, it matters not which has the earlier timestamp - they both have an equal chance of being orphaned. The timestamp is still important, but for reasons that have nothing to do with orphaned blocks (the time is used to determine difficulty adjustments).

You'd still be able to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, you just wouldn't be able to claim a tax deduction if the new shares are repurchased in fewer than 30 days. You'd have to wait until a later when you sold the shares without re-buying to claim the deduction.

I'm glad was unbanned, but it clearly only happened because the community threw a fit to get attention from the reddit admins. Had it been any of us in his position (shadowbanned for inadvertently breaking a rule we didn't know existed) -  we would likely be SOL.  
My point is - Reddit needs to fix how people are shadowbanned.  There needs to be some sort of warning given so people know they have broken a rule and are given a chance to correct their behavior. So many good users have lost multi-year accounts without any sort of recourse or warning.

No, the transaction would be valid on both networks, but probably wouldn't get incorporated into a block on the old network because there would be no miners and mining would be "stuck" on a high difficulty. Generally speaking there's no way to lose coins during a hardfork. The only exception would be say if you are a merchant and you accept a BTC payment for something on the wrong fork (because you didn't update your software for example), then the payee performs a doublespend on the new network. This shouldn't happen as long as merchants update whatever kiosk/tablet/software they use to verify transactions.  Good questions :)  500 bits @_date: 2015-01-15 00:45:45

First, volatility. Coinapult/Bitreserve "locks" fix the volatility problem.  This solution is so obvious and already exists, you can use the bitcoin network sans volatility risk - problem solved.
Next he talks about being able to trust the people storing bitcoin, and of course that will always be an issue.  If bitcoins are lost they cannot be recovered.  This I think is fixed very simply by requiring institutions that hold bitcoin to maintain adequate insurance that will cover any/all losses if coins ever go missing.  Again, simple no-brainer solution.
Next he talks about how governments will want to maintain a record of all transactions to see where money is going and where it came from.  Again this is doable - they would just need to pass a law that requires all bitcoin transactions to go through "bitcoin banks" so that a record of every transaction and each party is recorded.  This is an extreme solution, but Bitcoin is MUCH easier to track than physical cash. And of course they could outlaw tumblers/mixers if they wanted to. 
It looks like Gates may have not really given bitcoin as much thought as it deserves - the issues he brings up are easily solvable.

I think most people would agree that the price is currently driven mostly by speculation (people like myself buying and holding) - an ETF would just make buying and holding easier/more secure and open it up to wider audience (401ks, IRAs, institutions). I think we are still several years away from true usage-driven price growth.  One day though I do expect most of the growth will come from people actually using it to transact/remit/hedge against inflation etc.

**A bitcoin believer on its perils and its potential**
*Murad Ahmed, European Technology Correspondent*
Bitcoin is dangerous and people should steer away from using it. This is a bearish opinion held by many traditional investors, but not one
you would expect from the man responsible for turning the virtual currency into a commodity worth billions.
Yet, that is the view of Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, the closest thing to a central bank for the nascent
cryptocurrency. He is considered the leading custodian of the bitcoin code, the rules and software used to run the cryptocurrency. But far
from being a cheerleader, Mr Andresen, is warning ordinary people to avoid bitcoin — for now.
“It actually is dangerous and people should be aware it’s like the early internet,” he tells the Financial Times.
“If you lived through time, you remember lots of press articles came out saying don’t give internet
companies your credit card details. But the internet grew past that. Bitcoin will be the same way. Over time,
I will stop saying to people, ‘Don’t use it unless you’re technically proficient enough to keep your computer
Concerns about security were heightened on Monday after Bitstamp, Europe’s leading bitcoin exchange,
suspended its operations following an apparent hack that led to the company losing 19,000 bitcoins, worth
about $5m.
These safety issues have led to a steady fall in the price of the cryptocurrency. At its peak, bitcoin was traded
for $1,240 on the Mt Gox exchange, the Japanese group that filed for bankruptcy last year after losing about
$450m worth of bitcoin in a cyber attack. According to Coindesk, the bitcoin news site, the price is now about $283.
“Bitstamp is handling the incident well,” Mr Andresen says, by being transparent and explaining to customers what happened. “I hope
they take the time to publish a complete postmortem on details of the attack, so other exchanges can learn from their mistakes.
“I hope Mt Gox does the same because we still don’t know what happened.”
Mr Andresen is considered the protégé to “Satoshi Nakamoto”, the name adopted by the supposed inventor of bitcoin. After collaborating
on the project over email, Mr Andresen was given Mr Nakamoto’s blessing to become the “core maintainer” of the bitcoin source code,
working full time on the project.
While Nakamoto appears to have vanished, Mr Andresen wields huge influence on the development of the currency. He helped to found
the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and groups from financial regulators to the CIA seek his advice.
His knowledge of bitcoin has led to suggestions he may actually be Nakamoto. “I am not Satoshi,” he laughs.
“Ask any geek. Point them to code written by Satoshi and point them to code written by me. You can tell,
they’re not the same guy.”
His theory is that the inventor is “a young academic type, somewhere in the world. I don’t think Japan.
Perhaps the British Isles actually because in Satoshi’s communications he [used British rather than
American spellings]. I think there’s an academic thinking about other stuff, sitting on a big pile of bitcoin.”
The one person who Mr Andresen says is definitely not Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian S. Nakamoto, the
Japanese­American engineer that Newsweek named as bitcoin’s inventor last year. Mr Nakamoto, who lives
in California, denies any role in bitcoin.
“He’s not the Satoshi I talked to,” says Mr Andresen. “I feel sorry for Dorian that so much personal attention
got focused on this person. That shows why the actual Satoshi has worked so hard to stay anonymous.”
His influence at the Bitcoin Foundation could soon increase, after it emerged Jim Harper, its global policy
counsel, was dismissed earlier this month. The move is seen as a shift in focus for the non­profit group away from policy and regulation
and back towards developing bitcoin’s core technology.
“It is always hard when an organisation pivots and priorities change,” he said. “Effective organisations have a
clear mission and focus and there is plenty of work to be done on the technical front to keep the foundation
Though Mr Andresen concedes bitcoin remains in the early days of its development, he is confident it will
mature, noting that more than $300m of venture money had been invested in bitcoin start­ups in 2014.
Mr Andresen is also at the forefront of efforts to ready the virtual currency for wider use. As it is currently
designed, the bitcoin network can process just seven transactions a second. By comparison, Visa is capable of
handling close to 50,000 transaction a second at peak times.
Mr Andresen’s proposed solution is to increase the size of bitcoin blocks, the files that hold the data that
underpins the currency. Their size limits the speed at which the bitcoin network can process transactions.
Larger blocks can contain more transactions and, therefore, increase the capacity of the network.
But there are concerns that increasing the block size will put a strain on the network. Bigger blocks packed
with more transactions requires transmitting and storing more data. This may also make it difficult for hobbyists to store a full copy of the
“blockchain”, centralising power in the hands of corporations that can afford expensive servers in big data centres.
The issue is being debated by bitcoin developers. But Mr Andresen says that “we’re really close to consensus” to approve his proposal, a
move that “in 20 years, would allow us to have enough capacity to handle every single electronic transaction in the world”.
While Mr Andresen tries to prepare bitcoin for mass usage, he advises caution to investors. He holds thousands of bitcoins, enough to
retire comfortably. But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.
“Bitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I’m diversifying out of all the time,” he says. “If bitcoin is wildly successful, I’m still holding on
to a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn’t make sense to hold more
than that amount. I don’t have a desire to be a multi­billionaire. That’s not what motivates me, I have no desire to be filthy rich.”

I would agree with you if it were any other exchange, but the vast majority of volume on Localbitcoins comes from end users who pay 5-10% *above* the going market rate to buy with cash and preserve their anonymity.

Honestly, I'd be fine with it.  No-rules reddit would be better than what we have now. If posts are spammy they get downvoted or removed by mods anyway.  And if someone truly wants to spam they just create a new account and spam with it until it gets banned - the rules don't do anything but get good people with multi-year accounts banned for minor offenses as in this case. Personally I'm constantly worried I'm going to get banned for tipping too frequently.

@_date: 2015-01-11 21:16:51
This guy is an idiot.  Two chains will NOT survive this fork, because NOBODY will be mining the old chain, and it will require a TON of mining power to get it past the downward difficulty adjustments.
Of course, many years later it would be possible to resurrect the old chain - once mining hardware has progressed to a point that mining the old chain and getting through the difficulty adjustments would be possible with little USD input.  Of course these coins would no longer be "bitcoins" - but it could survive as some sort of alt currency. 
It would be nice if Satoshi himself stepped back into the discussion to throw his support behind a fork - although we wouldn't necessarily need that to happen.

No rules + voting would work just fine. Show me a no rules + voting site that is full of spam. 


Two types of people are banned: day old spamming accounts, and multi-year users that inadvertently broke a rule that they didn't know existed and are banned without warning.  Both users just create new accounts and continue using the site.  Banning does exactly nothing.  The only people that are hurt are those with multi-year accounts that actually care about their reputation - these people would respond well to a warning (which is never provided)


so am I breaking the rules??  Who knows.  One day they will look at my account and just arbitrarily decide that I tip to much and ban me.

So basically the recovery phrase = the private key (technically the phrase is put through an algorithm to generate the private key). If the fork splits and you keep your coins on mycelium without moving them you will be fine (this is what I would do). The network will eventually decide which fork to follow, Mycelium will update their software accordingly, and then you can spend your coins worry free (I'd expect this to take ~1-2 weeks following the fork).
Now if the network forks and you spend the coins immediately after the fork, you will be spending them on one of the two chains, if the network reorganizes and decides not to use the chain that you spent the coins on,  then they will magically appear back in your wallet as if you've never spent them. Same goes if you receive coins right after the fork. It's possible they show up as confirmed in your wallet, then the network reorganizes and the coins vanish from your wallet. If you don't spend or receive coins around the time of the hardfork you will be fine.

Yes, raising the blocksize may have a non-negligable effect on smaller miners, and home users running nodes, I suppose that is true.
In contrast, full blocks are currently having an extremely detrimental effect on any user or business actually using bitcoin to conduct transactions, which is detrimental to bitcoin adoption and bitcoin dominance vs other cryptos. I guess I just have a hard time understanding how a small bump to the blocksize is so bad when you look at the current state of affairs, or how this presents some terrible philosophical conundrum for certain devs.

You must not send many transactions. I send a few hundred per day and my average is ~ 70 cents per txn. At least a few per day are in the $3-4 range. If congestion gets any worse I will stop transacting in bitcoin altogether and ask my customers to transact with me in some other crypto.

The truth is, it doesn't matter what you or I think. The miners are the only ones who have a vote in this debate, they vote via hashpower - and the side with 51% of the hashpower wins. That's how bitcoin was designed. So unless core wants to change the pow algo, there's not much they can do about it. Ultimately BU doesn't give the miners any more control than they already have.

@_date: 2017-03-26 18:45:01
I understand this criticism but don't think it's likely or even especially harmful. The miners will arrive at a consensus block size and set all of their clients to that number. When a majority of miners think this block size should be updated, they will convene a meeting, come to an agreement, and all set their clients to whatever blocksize they decide. The likelihood that there will be 50% of the network set to one blocksize and 50% of the network set to some other blocksize seems pretty unlikely. The miners have an economic incentive to agree on a specific blocksize setting because if they don't they are all risking an increased orphan rate (and therefore lost revenue).

There is no evidence that any of the volume was spam, if you have evidence please share. 
Every time the price goes up rapidly, the number of transactions goes up. I run a bitcoin business and can confirm that as the prices rise the number of customers I see also increases. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:53:04
If growth in usage continues, the fees will likely climb much higher than $1-2 dollars per transaction. As the fees climb higher growth will continue to slow obviously, but still I suspect the fees will be in the $5-$10 range by the end of the year if no scaling solution is adopted.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:41:45

I think what's confusing people here is your choice of words.  When things are "Backed" by a one-way peg they are not actually "backed" by anything in the true sense.  For counterparty the burn was was just a way to  distribute the coins at launch in a way that was provably fair and didn't benefit the developers. After the initial launch period, additional coins could not be created and the value of the counterparty token floated completely independent of the value of the BTC burned during the launch. So in this sense the term "peg" is really deceiving here, as it's not really pegged to anything or backed by anything. As a general rule it's impossible to peg the value of anything to a specific amount of BTC by burning.

I think I understand the concept here, basically a large pool can flood the network with transactions to boost the average txn fee paid by legit users. They can potentially make more than they spend because they get back the fees on the spam transactions they create. 
What I don't get is why the large spamming pool has an advantage over a small non-spamming pool in this scenario?  The non-spamming pool pays nothing and gets to collect profit on both the spam transactions from the big pool and the normal txn fees from legit users, while the big pool only gets to record a profit on the legit txns, plus they have to pay out the spam txn fees to other miners for any blocks they don't solve. Anyone care to clarify where I am going wrong here?

Fees would only get bid up if this behavior was able to generate a backlog of legit transactions. I guess if there was an agreement between pools to never confirm txns with a fee below x, it could work (if there were enough transactions on the network to fill the blocks coming from non-participating pools and people willing to pay x txn fee)

Fees would never go all the way to zero (even with infinite blocksizes) because there is some small cost that the miners pay to include a transaction - that is: every transaction in the block makes it a little bit bigger, which means it will propogate through the network a little slower, which slightly increases the likelihood that it will be orphaned. This of course does not mean a generous miner couldn't still include zero-fee transactions - but it does mean that he would be hurt by doing so (via increased orphan rate), and if you generated a zero-fee transaction you would likely have to wait a very long time for it to get confirmed by a weirdly generous miner.  


Not necessarily - if block size was completely uncapped, a malevolent miner could launch a sort of "blockchain bloat" attack, where he mines huge blocks full of spam transactions he generated himself (so he gets go keep all of the txn fees).  Although these blocks would propagate slowly through the network, they could still be incorporated into the blockchain and could cause a rapid increase in the size of the blockchain. This miner would of course lose money acting in this way (mining huge blocks that would be often orphaned), but it just shows that if the blockchain wasn't capped at all you could open the door to new types of attacks.

If the miners got $50k per day the network would continue to function just fine. There would just be less miners. 
Hell, if the block reward was ENTIRELY removed TODAY (instead of 100 years from now), the miners would still get ~$5k per day, and the network would continue to function just fine.  The amount that is paid in mining fees is continuing to climb, there is no indication that the network cannot be fully supported by mining fees alone as we slowly ween ourselves off of block rewards over the next century.

I talked to rassah a few hours ago, he explained it to me - i'll try to relay what he said as best as I can... Basically this is a bug that only presented because of the stress test. The transactions are fine, but sometimes if you close your app and re-open it, it will disappear because the app connected to a different node that didn't happen to have that transaction in its mempool. Close and re-open a few times and it will be back.  They are working on a patch so that the transaction details will be saved within the app itself and will not depend on a node to relay that info.

Looks like Antpool is now creating good blocks:
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:56:22
First, all stored coins are safe, regardless of what wallet you are using. If you are sending BTC from a trezor (or any wallet) you are at no risk of any losses.  ~~If you are receiving BTC you should wait for a few confirmations to ensure that the transaction is on a valid chain before accepting the payment as irreversible. (In reality, up to this point no transactions could have been doublespent because no transactions were included in the invalid blocks mined by F2Pool/Antpool/BTC_Nugget).~~ Use caution when receiving BTC as payment, there is a small but non-zero chance that coins you receive could be incorporated into an invalid block and then built upon by F2Pool/Antpool, if this happens it could appear that a transaction has accumulated many confirmations, but in reality the transaction could have only been added to the invalid chain, and could eventually be orphaned.  There is a very small chance of this happening for probably the next 24 hours or so (until BTC_Nugget/Antminer/F2Pool update their client/mining software).

You are describing a 51% attack, the cartel could not just orphan blocks that did not follow cartel protocol, they could exclude all non-cartel blocks. I personally doubt this would ever happen as it would probably crash the price of bitcoin and hurt members of the cartel, which would likely cause them to splinter.  Maybe if a single entity had 51%, in which case I'd expect a groundswell of support for a hardfork to a new hashing algo.

In addition, make sure your sellers are compliant with whatever regulation they are subject to, maybe they can operate as agents of the MSB (I have no idea what the law states).  The feds are probably going to continue to turn up the heat on LBC sellers and this will drive people to your service because *as an MSB with strict AML/KYC* you can potentially provide an umbrella of compliance that sellers can safely operate under.

If you swept the cold wallet to mycelium the private key is HOT and this wallet is no longer a cold wallet. Once the priv key has been exposed to the internet it's no longer cold!!
OP, you want to print off a new paper wallet from an offline computer, once a paper wallet has been swept, it can never be used again for cold storage.

I'm not sure why your address kept changing, but generally speaking yes, your wallet will retain the private keys for all of the addresses in your wallet indefinitely. When it updates to a new address you will still be able to receive payments at the old addresses.

@_date: 2015-07-30 20:30:38


While I am solidly in the bigger blocksize camp, I will explain why you are wrong. Miners are trying to make as much money as possible per block, and since it costs them almost nothing to include extra transactions in the block, they will naturally try to include as many transactions as possible so that they collect the most mining fees as possible.  This means that if a single miner decided to only accept high-value transactions and ignore low value transactions, he would lose money - and it wouldn't drive up the average fee because the next block would include all of the leftover transactions that the first miner left out.  The only way that fees would rise significantly is if all or almost all of the miners formed a cartel and set a new higher minimum fee.  In this situation any miner not in the cartel would make more money than non-cartel members because he can fill his blocks with lower-fee transactions instead of leaving that space empty, so it's very unlikely that such a cartel would exist for long imo. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 05:58:21
Dude, it all comes down to supply and demand. Sure you can increase supply (blocksize) by 1 mb with segwit and decrease demand (spam txns) by 50% with slightly higher fees... but if the network continues to grow THE # OF LEGITIMATE TXNS WILL EVENTUALLY SURPASS THE SPACE AVAILABLE and transaction fees will rise rise rise!!! It's not rocket science!

 Just check blockchain.info to verify that the coins were successfully transferred to your new address. There's no need to even connect bitcoin-qt to the internet at all, your coins will be perfectly fine and will wait at that address until you are ready to spend them.

What an incredibly short-sighted comment. Sure the fee will rise from 5 cents to 10 cents over the next 6-12 months, but what happens after that? That's what people care about. In a few years are we looking at 1 mb blocks and $5-10 txn fees, or 10 mb blocks and 5-10 cent transaction fees...
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:38:46
Sorry, it's not a very convincing argument.  Every node on the network verifies every transaction. Why would setting up a node at my house make any difference? So that I can verify my own transactions without relying on blockchain.info or mycelium's full node?  Sure, but how does that help the network?
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:56:37
The coins are in one of two places: At the address you sent them to or at the address you were sending from.  Just search blockchain.info for those two addresses to determine if the coins were actually sent or not. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:22:42
Sounds like that would be a good reason to switch wallets. Ultimately it's the miners who decide what transactions make it onto the blockchain anyway, the wallet seems like a silly place to try to enforce some sort of transaction filtering policy.

@_date: 2016-02-07 19:16:16
Most nodes are worthless as far as I can tell. I've hung around here for three years and still haven't heard a convincing argument why I should run one. As far as I can tell they just act like junk that stands between nodes that actually serve a purpose (miners, payment processors, wallet providers, etc). I think ideally the network would have maybe a few hundred nodes sitting in data centers near internet backbones in geographically diverse areas. That would ensure minimum latency and adequate redundancy.

You can see if the transaction was sent to your address by going to blockchain.info and typing your address into the search bar. Your ATM receipt should show the address that the coins were sent to, and it should match one of the addresses in your wallet.

Yes, the very best ways of tumbling are off chain, which is what I was referring to. ie convert BTC to monero, send it to an exchange, sell it back for BTC and then spend it. 
There are ways of tumbling onchain though via coinjoin-like protocols which anonymize the coins but not completely (ie its possible to draw some vague correlations between inputs and outputs) - but it would be impossible to prove a link definitively, so in any sort of criminal trial it would be essentially useless.  IE the prosecution could prove defendant A was one of 2000 people that used a bitcoin mixing pool which had an output that was used to buy drugs etc. And of course if you add the fact that you can mix for weeks/months if you want, that 1/2000 link could be diluted substantially.

Buyer: pays cash for bitcoins via localbitcoins or bitcoin ATMs (requires a throwaway burner phone  etc. - Send BTC to the receiver, ideally each localbitcoins/bitcoin ATM purchase would go to a different address that the receiver creates.
Receiver: Mix each batch of coins through either a coin mixer (such as bitblender) OR an altcoin (such as Dash or XMR). Now the reciever sells the coins on localbitcoins to other people in person (leaves no paper trail but is not anonymous because you meet face-to-face).  A bitcoin ATM is a better option because nobody sees your face, but it requires burner cell phone for "ID verification" typically. 
Also both buyer and receiver would need to use TOR while using localbitcoins etc. and pay for the burner phone with cash. This would leave the transactions 100% untraceable and anonymous (except for possible security footage wherever the bitcoin ATM is located or where burner phone is purchased). Easy peasy

It has always been unlikely that DPR kept all of his coins on a hot wallet that he carried around with him.  That is an unbelievably dumb thing to do, and very out of character for such a smart guy.  It is entirely possible that he had one or more additional encrypted cold wallets.  Depending on how they were encrypted, it's possible to see that a wallet contains BTC but not be able to access it (which appears to be the scenario here).  Alternatively you can encrypt a wallet such that it's not possible to determine whether it's even a wallet or not.

The chains wouldn't split because nobody would bother to mine or transact if they knew that they were not on the longest chain.  Maybe China would continue to mine because they can be reasonably certain that they are on the longest chain.  So the real answer is: Bitcoin would work fine as long as you live in an area that has access to the longest chain and can broadcast transactions to that chain. Everywhere else bitcoin would be effectively on "pause" until a link could be established to someone who can feed you the longest chain.

I agree, it would be pointless due to difficulty.  Even if they you did manage to mine a few blocks on a "local" chain it would take so long between difficulty adjustments that any miners left would certainly give up. Plus your "local chain" would be orphaned as soon as a connection to the outside world was reestablished - another reason not to mine. 


It wouldn't be dead, just on pause until connections were re-established.

It would be easy to fake reputation with such a system. Unless seller reputation can be trusted it is much more dangerous for a buyer than current DNM transactions, because culpable deniability is significantly degraded (ie random package arriving at your house vs. you going to a specific GPS coordinate to retrieve a drop).  
If a good reputation system can be built around this it could work well though, say if a small % of BTC is burned during each transaction - that would make it harder to fake transactions to build reputation.

I agree with him on everything except his last point. If you believe there's a 50% chance that bitcoin is going to a million dollars I think it makes sense to keep more than 1% of your net worth in bitcoin.

Have you ever seen a large amount of cash in person? It fits in a surprisingly small space. I'd guess you could fit 100k into the average sized shoebox, maybe even 150-200k.  At my bank they have XL safe deposit boxes that could probably fit &gt;1 million USD.

it depends how you tumble.  DarkWallet is trustless and they claim it is impossible to keep logs - Some people exchange BTC for Darkcoin and tumble within the DRK wallet - then exchange back to BTC - that is also trustless.

Exactly. In order to fake LBC volume you would need to conduct transactions with yourself and lose 1% in fees every time. Whereas you can move an unlimited number of BTC in a single transaction for pennies. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:25:40
If your description of the events is correct 1EX is definitely a LBC address. Keep emailing them until they send it back to you. Make sure to link to the transactions on blockchain.info to prove the coins were sent to you from 1EX and that it is the same address you sent coins back to accidentally. I'd be shocked if they don't send the coins back - it's very clear what happened when you look at the blockchain.

You should have included these details in your original post, I'm sure it would have prevented much of the confusion. Is she sure these wire transfers are not reversible?  My main concern would be that she gets a deposit, buys bitcoin, sends it off, then the deposit gets reversed somehow and she is left with a -3000 balance. If the deposits are legit, yes it still seems shady - if she is working for a company they should be using a company account to convert to fiat to USD.

Did the coins show up in your romit wallet? Do you see a balance or is it just zero?

It's unlikely they would all be sent at once. They were probably able to aquire small chunks of the ransom over the days that he was held hostage and the coins were sent to the ransomers as they were aquired.

@_date: 2015-03-08 15:37:27
You can tumble the coins to make all transactions completely anonymous.  That is the beauty of bitcoin, it can be 100% transparent (as you describe), or 100% anonymous by implementing a just a couple small measures (tor+tumbler). Many people (and journalists) haven't figured this out, but applications like DarkWallet will make the process of anonymizing transactions stupid easy and hard to ignore.

As a really crude method: It seems like it would be possible to broadcast a multi-output transaction over radio, and the sender could include in the transmission the private key to a second 'reward' output.  The only problem is that maybe two entities both listen to the transmission and try to claim the reward. But of course that wouldn't really matter to the original sender because his transaction would make it to the network regardless of who ended up with the reward output in the end.

Sharedcoin was a flawed implementation of coinjoin.  Coinjoin if implemented correctly and with a large mixing pool is anonymous - you cannot link a specific input with a specific output - at best you might be able to draw some vague low-probability correlation between an input and output.  Darkcoin is an example of a well-implemented coinjoin system, and has been thoroughly vetted by Kristov Atlas (the same person you quote above who outed sharedcoin as flawed).  TLDR: Coinjoin can be anonymous if implemented correctly!

Nobody is denying that some people are being introduced to BTC by ransomware. I doubt it makes up a large percentage of the volume though (almost certainly less than 10%, probably in the 2-3% range). Dark net market buyers make up the a large portion however, probably over 50% of the LBC volume.

"exploding" refers to rate of change.  RUB volume is up ~ 10x year over year, and continues to grow at an exponential rate every week. At this pace by the end of 2016 volume will be 25,000 BTC/week, more than double the cumulative weekly block reward.

Laundering money and tumbling coins are two completely different things. There is no amount of tumbling that will allow you to go out into society and start spending millions of USD without raising questions. The money still needs to be laundered through a front company or something similar (ie make a website that accepts BTC in exchange for a good or service, then fake a bunch of transactions). Bitcoin itself (or zerocash, DRK, XMR, etc) cannot actually launder money.

He also stole XMR - I had 700 XMR in my acct when mintpal folded. Haven't received anything since.

He is right, bitcoin itself is not going to launder money (ie make it look like it came from a legit source) - but it would be possible to build a front business that 'accepts payment in bitcoin' - and launder the money that way. 
Mr. Smith, where did you get the money used to buy this $5 million dollar Manhattan apartment?  A: I run an amateur porn site (front) which accepts payment in bitcoin.  I sell the bitcoin for USD on LocalBitcoins and claim all proceeds as income when filing taxes.. (money laundered).  The beauty of this is he will actually get higher than market rates by selling his BTC for cash on LocalBitcoins. 
Alternatively Mr. Smith could just claim that the coins came from mining in the early days - sell for USD, pay taxes, Launder complete. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:26:15
Actually it looks more impressive in USD terms in my opinion. When you remove all of the BTC price volatility the underlying growth has been consistently strong. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:39:02
This doesn't change anything.

It's possible that they sent the coins to the address that they gave you originally - to check if this is the case here's what you do: go to blockchain.info and paste in the PUBLIC key into the search box, hit enter.  It will show you if there is any balance at that address.  If there IS a balance, you need to download a wallet (electrum is a good choice) and import the PRIVATE key into the wallet. 
Now if that address is empty they still have your coins for some reason. As I understand it, when you fill out the form to put a hold on a sell order you need to either provide a public address (which you didn't do) or have them make one for you.  If the address they gave you for the first transaction is empty they must have created a new address for you and sent the coins to that second address without providing the private key to you (maybe some sort of technical glitch on their end). If this is the case you'll need to email them again to request that private key.  Make sure to explain to them that you never received a public/private key and that they need to send it to you.

I've never used rombit, but there should be the option to "Send" bitcoin where you can input any address (such as from a retailer or from another wallet such as blockchain.info - the coins will then be sent from your rombit wallet to the address. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:48:58
Volume in USD transacted over the BTC network is the most completely useless metric ever, as anyone with a few hundred coins can artificially inflate the transaction volume at nearly zero cost by moving their stash back and forth between addresses every block.

just a scam to sell more coffee. There is zero volatility if you're using a service like bitpay. And even without bitpay how much volatility are you going to experience on a $3 coffee?  What a fucking dirtbag.

This is probably the most under-discussed aspect of bitcoin that makes it different than anything that has ever existed.  Bitcoin is the first and only method to anonymously receive value - which makes it perfect for receiving ransom payments (sadly).

The coins can be 100% traceable or 100% untraceable, depending on what the user chooses.  The coins can become untraceable by tumbling (via many different methods).

Is there any evidence that the coins have moved on the blockchain? Check the address you last sent coins to.

If you live in MD, OH, VA, or PA you can sell bitcoins at BlackFrogATM.com for cash. They charge only a 2% fee. Not sure what coinbase is charging.

This would only work if a means of tumbling coins did not exist.  As long as there are people with clean coins that are willing to use tumblers, it will be impossible to blacklist anything.

He's not running an exchange, he was a drug dealer.  Maybe he needs a few btc hot at any given time to conveniently process refunds - but even that could have been done with a trezor (which would have kept the coins safe from confiscation). Any coins used to buy fiat or replenish merchandise could have been left in cold storage until payment was needed.

Eventually you will be able to keep your BTC in a bank, just like you do with USD.  You will have a debit card (or something else) which you can wave at merchants and the BTC amount will be deducted from your balance. All of these transactions will occur off-chain. Investors will just buy an ETF ticker.  The vast majority of BTC users will never think about security.  Maybe a select few who are paranoid about gov't seizure or whatever will hold some in a vault similar to the whay people sock away gold today.

Offline means that the wallet will be installed on a computer that will never touch the internet.  It is an extremely safe way to store bitcoin.  Armory is excellent for this purpose.

I can definitely help you.  Which wallet did you download? When you bought from bitquick did you give them your wallet address to send the coins to or did you have them create one for you?  If you had them create a private key for you, you will need to "import" this private key into the wallet that you are using.  Let me know where you're getting stuck and I can help you fix it.

You can take a dollar bill and write up a contract that says "Anyone who holds this dollar bill owns my Beverly Hills mansion" - Does this make all of the other dollars in circulation any less valuable?  No, it actually makes them slightly more valuable because now there's 1 Dollar that's no longer in circulation.

I have a similar question. What if I send someone bitcoin who doesn't already have bitcoin. How does that work over LN? From what I've ready you need to already have bitcoin to open a channel. So let's say someone walks up to a bitcoin ATM and buys bitcoins, does the ATM company open a lightning channel with the customer or what happens here? I've also read that in order to open a channel you need an on-chain transaction. So would there need to be an on-chain transaction for every new ATM customer?
