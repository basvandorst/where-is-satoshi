Interesting question.... Why will the £ hit 10k? Bitcoin increasing in value or us tanking our currency?

Do you think there were roman soldiers going round saying "My brother opened a salt mine last week, keeps trying to get me to open my own."
Then a few years later propped up the local bar saying "I wish I listened to my brother!"

If it's truly crashing though the reason will be that no one is buying it. Can't sell something noone wants.

My brain ignored the pound sign in your post.
"why are you telling people casually that you've just bought 100 bitcoin?"

You could argue both ways. At times when block rewards are high, more miners mine. Eventually there are too many miners and it gets too expensive to mine, so miners drop out... Rinse lather repeat. 
But this says nothing about the price of bitcoin, just how much of the pie each miner gets. 
If the number of miners is somewhat stable, then the price of bitcoin needs to of sufficient amount to compensate all of their costs.

You need a Legitimate reason to file for a divorce. You might want to divorce because you realise your wife is a cunt, but need a legal out. This could be it.

Bitcoin Dr who

In my opinion, the most sensible way to value bitcoin is to price in such a way that block rewards plus fees compensate the miners for the cost of mining blocks, plus a suitable profit. Economically, the price of bitcoin should follow electricity costs. In the long long long term I believe this is what the price of bitcoin will be based on.
At the moment it is mostly speculation.

So is it illegal to own it? Or illegal to use it as currency?
