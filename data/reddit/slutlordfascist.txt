I told them about my bitcoins and they said "that's stupid, just invest in stocks like we did," but first they made me pay rent
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:30:53
So says the penischopper.
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:56:02
because half the time you're buying poor quality junk and getting screwed out of your money
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:29:06
I am pretty confident this is a terrible thread.
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:29:31
I see that is now This sub is terrible.

I'm just fucking with y'all, my Bitcoins are safe in Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:06:37
Tbh, I think that Bitcoin is on the way out.  Dogecoin is the future.  Bitcoin has the image of autistic neckbeards, whereas dogecoin is fun and fanciful.  Bitcoin just comes across like a desperately lonely nerd begging for sex.  Dogecoin, OTOH, has a dog(e) mascot and the wide support of the Reddit community.

Whole lotta jerk going on 'round here.

the "company" that does so is the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and while I'm not a fan of U.S. monetary policy, it's not counterfeiting because the government recognizes federal reserve notes as legitimate tender
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:08:36
federal reserve doesn't actually print money
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:38:03
FUCK YOU MY LIFE'S SAVINGS IS GONE AND YOU WON'T LET THE GOVERNMENT PROTECT ME FROM BITCOIN BANDITS

he took out a loan and bought 40 BTC and he's going to gamble to make up his losses
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:21:23

No, I want a bailout.

This just goes to prove that Bitcoin has long-lasting value and is a solid investment.  No need to worry about the downturn this week.
What happens with a large sell-off?  The price crashes.  What happens when a lot of people buy?  The price increases.  That means when there's a crash, you need to buy, buy, buy.  Cheap coins means that the wealth is being redistributed from the whales to the little guy--which means the more you buy, the healthier Bitcoin is.
	
When you buy Bitcoins, you're
• making money (buy low, sell high)
• creating demand (meaning more businesses will accept them)
• investing in your future (Bitcoins *are* the future)
• disempowering the people who want to stop Bitcoin (shills, fascist governments, and haters)
• bringing us to the moon!
If you bought at $1,000--hold on to your butts, because we're going to hit $2,000 within a year.  If you're considering buying in now, DO IT.  If you're thinking of selling, DON'T.  You'll regret it.
Come on, we can do it!

@_date: 2013-12-18 20:26:24
We'll see a HUGE increase in price with this--and with the holiday season coming up.  Bitcoin Black Friday 2.0.  Let's make this baby happen!
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:15:21
That is the most amazing website I've ever seen.
















@_date: 2013-12-18 20:15:01
The government has a vested interest in the future of Bitcoin.  All signs point to MOON!
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:23:52
Seems kind of a waste given the cap on Bitcoins mined.  Maybe a few years ago.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:37:48
But now they need to make it work!  Just wait until Obama sees what a good value Bitcoins are and starts buying them with T-bonds.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:35:21
Good goy, invest in Bitcoins while they're $1,000 apiece.  Drive up my profits.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:09:56
I'm just saying, together we can make it to the moon.  Buy and hold, baby!

What you're really saying is that you're in cahoots with Bernanke and the international banking system.  GET OUT.

U.S. government buys billions in bitcoins.  Market soars.  U.S. government immediately cashes out all bitcoins for USD.  Market crashes.  U.S. government buys up all the cheap bitcoins.  Repeat until national debt is paid off.
