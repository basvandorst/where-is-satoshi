I would say it would be better to just keep asking for him to be here and there. He knows his deal. What I am kind of worried about is that he might burn out with so many things going on and so many places to be at. He is very special, one of the kind.

I guess some ppl believe that precious metals are ultimate safety in case everything goes to shit, including Internet (for example with power grid down). I'm not saying I believe it will happen but it is a possibility. Besides, some speculate that btc might have some backdoor thing planted by cia schmucks that has not been discovered. 
I consider myself GB with 2/3 in metals and 1/3 in BTC.

I meant gold bug. I am not sure if it's a common thing but I believe I saw it on silverdoctors or king world news :-P

The problem was with stability of the main exchange at that time that is gox. It was ddosed and nobody could do any transaction. The lucky ones that got through queued transactions that were executed hours later. Basically whole big mess. That happened twice or three times during a day or two and that basically caused panic. Also the people that were long term holders saw the opportunity at those prices making thousands percent in profit. 
In general I think it was like competing who will get further on the thin ice and make it back without the ice braking underneath. Some made it back ;-)

Let's see if this trend continues when government shutdown is resolved that is probably on 17th. I would expect for the trend to continue at least that long.

My Polish bank also refused a couple weeks ago. Actually they locked my funds for like two weeks and when I started to complain to Bitstamp that they should have my fiat I started to investigate. It turned out that my bank never wired the money.

Nice catch. Thx. Although having some competition would not hurt ;-)

Some say that this is due to the fact that 1000 yuan has been broken which was suppose to be good technical indicator. Sounds reasonable to me.
