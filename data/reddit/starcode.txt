I just ordered 2 bottles of ice cream over the german food delivery service lieferservice.de with 7500 connected restaurants (they accept BitCoin since today).

High price on april 12/14? That were the days when it crashed...

My mother (approaching 71) yesterday asked me, it I could invest some of her money in bitcoins. I tried to tell her some background of bitcoin and she told me "I already know, I've read about it on wikipedia".
Maybe we did not reach the "public" moment yet... but we reached the critical mass so that it's spreading on its own
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:14:40
The restaurant just called me: they don't earn enough on a "ice cream only order" to drive about 5km to me. Now I have to pay 3 EUR in fiat directly to the driver.
Lesson learned: Never invest ALL your money into BitCoin... you might need some EUR in your offline wallet ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:08:15
In between, I no longer thought to see the money ever again... but MtGox seems to be alive.
I just wonder when the 2nd payment from 2 days later arrives (still in status "confirmed")

Your diagram looks too pessimistic.
[This is the hype cycle diagram from wikipedia](
We've reached the "Plateau of Productivity". The problem with the booming price is that bitcoins are limited and the plateau of productivity expands the reach of bitcoins. Now X times the people want to own bitcoins, not only to take part of the raise but to use it as a currency too.

Now you can be lucky it you get them for $57,5.
But you'll get over it, if it reaches $67,5 tomorrow :-)
@_date: 2013-03-25 10:56:24
= $25,000,000 :-)
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:15:05
Might happen, but I think a slower rise would be better for the medium and long term. It's rising so incredible fast... I'm scared.
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:36:18
$500M ~ $46/BTC
I would guess within 2 weeks
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:38:54
10,926 million BTC * $68,65 = $750,21 million
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:08:41
That already was in June 2011

Based on their [monthly statement on Google Docs](
* the dividend for the last month is about 2,10% of the current share price
* the annualized dividend yield based on the past month will be 25,22% of the current share price
Conclusion: you'll better directly invent in bitcoins, they have increased in value by 60% in the last month
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:44:34
I cannot find any references to BitCoin on their website yet. The press release says "now".
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:44:31
Electrum does this automatically, there is no manual step required
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:54:46
Nice start! 
I thing the phrase "password" and the visual that the upcoming blocks already exist and are locked by those passwords may be misleading. For example it doesn't explain why only the block directly above the last unlocked and be mined. And it might scare people that "passwords" are "guessed", this sounds not very secure.
Maybe you could use "puzzle" that has to be "solved" instead?

Geil! :-)
I was to lunch already but I just ordered 2 Häagen-Dazs ice cream over lieferservice.de for 68,3 mBTC (~ 13 EUR).
Interesting: BitPay seems to reuse "old" addresses for payment. The address where I send my BTC to was already used for several other transactions since Feb 2013:
I own some BTC since 1 year, but until today I just hoarded &amp; traded them. Now I was able to spend some mBTC them for something usefull (ok, I'm not really hungry &amp; it isn't really warm outside to enjoy the ice cream, I what else should I have ordered at a food delivery service!?)
I'm really bullish about the future of my BTC right now :-). I hope I don't eat up all my BTC before they rise in value.

It would be nice if you could have a graph showing USD &amp; EUR rates on a single graph, with conversion of EUR to USD using the current fixed exchange-rate or using the historic exchange-rate.
Currently I'm always opening these graphs on bitcoincharts.com in 2 tabs and switching fast between them to have an pseudo-overlay.

Wow... not even 2 days!
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:29:04
This "Mindestbestellwert" is available on the german site too. 
They told me, they earn only a few cent per Ice Cream and you have to order cooked food at the value of this "Mindestbestllwert".
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:34:30
It MAY take a day... but usually will be confirmed as fast as transactions with a fee.

I'm using the Electrum Client (
This program provides:
* an encrypted wallet that requires no downloading of the full blockchain,
* uses deterministic key generation that enables you to regenerate the wallet from a 128-bit seed value,
* provides offline functionality and 
* offers a secure read-only-wallet.
I used the following steps:
* I created my wallet on a PC that I don't use often. During installation the PC was offline and I checked for viruses using a Live-CD befor installation.
* I wrote down the 128-Bit seed value (in form of 12 simple words) on a piece of paper and stored it at a safe place. I deleted the client &amp; wallet from this PC, reinstalled the client and re-build the wallet using this seed to verify that everything was working as expected.
* I used the "electrum get master_public_key" method of the client (currently only available using the commandline!) to extract the master publickey of the wallet.
* I installed electrum on my regular workstation and created a wallet using this master publickey.
Now I have a read-only wallet on my workstation without any private keys, that's quite secure. I can just use it to view the balance of my bitcoin addresses. If I want to spend some of the bitcoin, I have to use my old PC with the full wallet.
If you want you can run your own Electrum Server ( and connect the client to it. This brings you to the same trust level of using a full blockchain client.

There are 2 different dates in their announcement... but I would interpret it so CoinLab opens on March 31st for new customers and tomorrow for MtGox customers:
@_date: 2013-03-14 18:49:36
BTC liquidity problems are only solved by rising value of BTC.
What liquidity do you expect?
As Bitcoin is a crypto internet currency I think "Fortune 500" is the wrong benchmark. I think Alexa Top 500 is better suited here... and this is making progress: already 3 Alexa Top 500 sites are accepting Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:41:02
If you look at the [MtGox market depth]( you see, that there are bids for 40,000 BTC but only asks for about 24,000 BTC.
It's only a correction. It was rising too fast in the last few hours.
@_date: 2013-03-07 08:51:40
Developing facebook was kind of "get rich quick" scheme too... within 6 years from under 1 million to 1 billion, that's a average growth of over 10% per month.
The thing with bitcoin is, that the number of coins are limited. If bitcoins gets accepted more and more and 1 billion people use it for payment within 6 years their wallets need to be filled with bitcoins. How big might a average wallet be so that you can go shopping... ~$100? 1 billion * ~$100 = $100 billion / 16 million BTC (in 2018) =&gt; $6000/BTC. Of course this is only the potential.
The bitcoin acceptance is growing. This can be measured by the number of news here on reddit, the number of new bitcoin startups, venture capital investments, user-interest indicated by google-trends and so on. So the current direction is UP... even if it is still possible that the direction might go down again if use bitcoins is not user-friendly, get forbidden by government, alternative currencies receive more attraction, ...

Since a few month the frequency of news in the mainstream-press is increasing... and non-tech-people as well as companies and big investors get in touch with bitcoins.
I think a growth of 30-60%/month is possible over the next 3-6 month and at 10-30%/month for the rest of the next year. After this... maybe growing at 25-100% for the next few years?
* in 1 month: $55 (~ $45 * 1,3) to $75 (~ $45 * 1,6)
* in 6 month: $200 (~ $45 * 1,3^6 ) to $750 (~ $45 * 1,6^6 )
* in 1 year: $400 (~ $45 * 1,3^6 * 1,1^6 ) to $3,500 (~ $45 * 1,6^6 * 1,3^6 )
* in 5 years: $1,000 (~ $45 * 1,3^6 * 1,1^6 * 1,25^4 ) to $60,000 (~ $45 * 1,6^6 * 1,3^6 * 2^4 )
@_date: 2013-03-14 18:43:00
In 5 years there will be ~17,5 million BTC. At a price of $1000/BTC, the market cap of all BTC available for all wallets &amp; transactions worldwide is "just" $17,5 billion! That's nothing for a currency and only about 40 times higher than today. I call this a pessimistic scenario.
What's the reason for your assumption?
* Do you expect the number of bitcoin users in 5 years to be less than 40x of today (0,5 to 4 million now, less than 20 to 160 million in 2018)?
* Or do you think the avg. $ value contained in each wallet will be significant less than today (about $100-$1000/user today based on 0,5 to 4 million users)?

MtGox made a exclusive deal with Silicon Valley based Coinlab: they take over all US/Canada accounts on march 22. Coinlab will handle this market and MtGox will stay 100% out of this market (presumably to be independent of the US regulation). But as it is announces they will access the same liquidity pool and use a unified order book.

So you only have the choice between coinbase and coinlab which are both under US law.

So you think there will be a crash when the bitcoin reaches about $100 and it will need about 1 year to recover from that?
@_date: 2013-03-07 08:27:54
Some exchanges have tagged BitCoin addresses, see  For example, when you search for bitcoin-24 on that site you'll find bitcoin address (1BTC24yVKQdQNAa4vX71xLUC5A8Za7Rr71)[ of bitcoin-24.com that has received over 150k BTC. Maybe this is their cold storage wallet? But I think most exchanges have mostly random addresses and don't use a single address for cold storage.
Another way might be to identity the IP addresses of Exchange transactions... would be plausible that all transactions are initiated by that IP.

The problem is, that paypal/credit card can be refunded.
If you pay with paypal and got the coins and than call paypal and tell them that this was a fraud.... paypal will charge back your money but the other person has no chance to get the coins back (as you are almost anonymous).
The IMPORTANT rule is: do not sell bitcoins with refundable payment!

Over 12% per day... 
With this growth, we will reach $100 in 3 1/2 days!

What is worse for you:
* if you loose your $1,000 investment completely because at the end of the year nobody is interested in bitcoins anymore 
* if you missed the chance to invest $1,000 now and the bitcoin will continue to grow at a rate of 30% or 60% per month (avg. growth rate of the last 2 month was 60%) and at the end of the year you realize that your $1,000 investment would now have a value of $13,800 (30%) or even $110,000 (60%)?
If you think it's worse to miss a chance compared to loosing your investment... than you should invest now.
The next thing you should consider is the amount to invest: rething about the 2 questions above with different amounts to invest until you come to the point that both senarios are equally bad:
* loose $1 vs. miss $12.8 (30%) / $109 (60%)
* loose $100 vs. miss $1,280 (30%) / $10,900 (60%)
* loose $10.000 vs. miss $128.000 (30%) / $1,090,000 (60%)
But of course: it's not fool proof. If you invest, the risk is quite high to loose all your money!

I've you now order your ASICs, you'll have them in a few months (hopefully). Maybe your thousands are millions by that time!

Down to ~~$488M~~ $472M again... but not to worry: yesterday the chart-pattern was nearly the same: 
* strong rise in the UTC morning hours up to nearly $41, then a drop at 10am UTC back to $39 and staying around $40 for the rest of the day
* today a strong rise in the UTC morning hours up to nearly $47, now a drop at ~10am UTC back to ~~$45~~ $43,5.
Will the pattern repeat and we'll end the day by $46?

There was a discussion about this at bitcointalk.org:
[Bitcoin Unit Colour Chart](
The result was roughly:
* 1.0 BTC = 1 BTC (gold colored ฿-Icon)
* 0.001 BTC = 1 mBTC (blue colored m฿-Icon)
* 0.000'001 BTC = 1 μBTC (green colored μ฿-Icon)
* 0.000'000'01 BTC = 1 Satoshi or sBTC (black colored s฿-Icon)
