I prefer the instant buy over waiting 5 business days.  If I have 500 to spend in checking, id buy with credit for the same amount. 
You're a dick
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:31:48
Coinbase should just hire all of us
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:20:33
Wonder how much it would cost to have the bitcoin logo on their jerseys
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:46:03
How this happen? Did you know the person? If not, how they know you had them?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:19:02
You think he just wanted to steal your phone and didn't know about the bitcoin? I can't imagine he'd have access if your pw protect your wallet app
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:32:26
What a dick
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:20:32
you care so much about random stranger's financial situation and choices, I'll be sure to pm you if i'm going through a bad break up and need a shoulder to cry on
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:11:26


lol if i had a satoshi for everytime i've said this...
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:49:43
this video is funny
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:32:21
yeah its annoying. A block hasnt been confirmed in over an hour and the site is laggy
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:25:44
not really. I clearly understood that US Treasury wont regulate miners and investors
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:13:14
They're not horrendous? Dude I love bitcoin but these regulations are ridiculous if they stick. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:59:17
i rsvp'd when it was annouced as well and they got back to me two days ago.
They said:
"Due to overwhelming interest and limited space in the hearing room, we could not accommodate every request to attend the hearing in person" 
"we could not accommodate your request to attend the hearing in person"
Of course I didn't have a shot to attend
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:40:14
What would be some* mining pool attributes that would attract Ghash miners to come to them instead?
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:59:08
He's known as the mouthpiece for the ones who run the show in the economy so of course he would say this
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:19:59
cloudbet has been the best alternative ever since bitbook.biz went away....RIP bitbook
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:13:06
you hang out at because you care so much
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:19:44
a criminal?
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:37:04
Nice talking to you. I imagine I'll know which post to find you in just by reading the title ;)
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:22:56
yea for the most part
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:25:04
What did he say about ron paul coin?
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:04:32
It sounds like your whole purpose and intention of being on is to instigate situations where you can get your laughter off of people you call are idiots. You consider bittersweet time commenting ad hominems to a target group for long periods of time. 
Someone honestly wanting to learn about bitcoin just reading your responses in this post could see your just trying to incite an angry or should I say "butthurt" response from people. 
You're pretty obvious, you stand out ;)
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:44:38
this might be irrelevant to this convo but has anyone ever discover who stole the bitcoins from one of the blackmarket drug websites (not silkroad)
I remember "blockchain detectives" discovering where the bitcoins were but I* never followed up with what came from it 
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:12:53
it used to be bitbook.biz but they shut down.. =\
cloudbet.com looks like the site ill use once football season comes back
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:16:27
not sure where that came from!
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:16:02
why ur dissing ron paul coin for?
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:50:31
ill never forget this...
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:04:03


the fuck is wrong with you
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:47:04
The average person is turned off by personal insults which is what I was referring to. 
Also your great work ethic in taking a couple "jabs" at "monkeys" daily on a subreddit your against is something that would turn off the average person. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:50:33
The most important part to take note of your post there is the last part. You spend a good part of your day trying to incite your opposition with insults in order to rise anger and derail casual conversations.
You stand out in a peculiar way to a average  viewer. Not something I'm sure you don't really desire at all
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:29:35
how would 1,000 bitcoins sound?
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:24:54
as long as its not touching below 400 i'm happy
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:16:37
no clue, they was getting DDoS'd and then a couple weeks later they told everyone that they will be allowing people to withdraw their coins so at least they went out with class
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:47:12
what a generalization
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:17:55
you most likely used 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:13:56
now i can get that ron paul channel subscription from tiny pass with this bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:18:51
that buttcoin site is very bizarre 
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:35:59
would everyone in this mining pool stand to benefit from being above 51% or is it specific few?
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:03:44
There it is again, the whole purpose of this act is protecting others with your advice and your good will. That's rich ;)
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:50:31
You're right, he should blame himself for not putting the 20 dollars into bitcoin rather than in a bank that charges fees for "holding" his money safe
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:48:32
The* deposit doesnt get processed until the next business day if you deposit it into an ATM, if you do it on a friday night it would not get processed until mondya morning

this is comment is funny but disappointed that your comment history is constantly talking about the bitcoin circle jerk. Just a one trick pony ;(
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:59:45
Until I see a real effort for the government to cut spending and pay down the debt. So probably never.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:53:41
That's awesome
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:25:50
That is  true with football season...1 bitcoin on titans beating the bucs in week 1
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:39:34
Thanks, I wont even bother then
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:25:08
your last point is totally right.


@_date: 2015-04-07 23:21:21
The 2nd cable company in an area can definitely get more customers if the current one is charging a lot alone. If it can provide better service and cheaper than it makes a lot of sense. 
The reason why it doesn't happen in new Jersey is because the companies have "sweatheart" deals with the areas to not allow others there
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:21:13
i guess you dont get out much
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:21:07

@_date: 2013-11-18 20:31:01
what site do you use other than coinbase?
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:06:15
oh wow, how so
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:48:54

@_date: 2013-11-23 20:01:43

@_date: 2013-11-19 21:58:44
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:38:54
i tend to stay away from reading the comment section for this reason
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:01:04
I don't feel like going through 1,500 comments but has there been anyone openly stating they might commit suicide on here?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:14:27
i wishhhhhh coinbaseeee woulllllddddd let meeeeeeeee
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:55:36

@_date: 2013-11-19 17:41:40
How about, just as important
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:46:45
hire a lawyer that would accept payment in bitcoin while you're at it
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:50:28
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:41:41
Is there another BitCoin exchange site that uses Capital One 360 ?
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:10:14
its spoken like "[fee]( and "[yacht]( put together
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:11:28
not even clever. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:32:55
this site is safe?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:03:07
this is exactly the psychology of the bitcoin market. There's no way it would slide below 450* imo. People have been waiting for the crash to happen so the moment a big drop off and by big i mean only 100 drop, everyone and their uncle will finally buy in, others like me and you will buy more. Maybe it would naturally drop more than 100 points but people are getting impatient to make a buck so they will stop the drop from happening
I'm sure we can predict nervous people who want to cash out a large sum into fiat because they have other plans but like you said **too many people trying to get cheap coins**
