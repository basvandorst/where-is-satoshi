I don't expect jack shit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:10:21
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:12:48
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:07:03
It took me 36 hours.  They said it would be 4 days.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:12:10
So you mean, like it's been... forever?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:32:00
You are correct.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:02:20
You don't understand how few people want it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:44:03
The exchanges control all cryptocurrencies.  They make money by selling it to you and for you.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:32:57
If you want anything to be stable boundarys must be set.  Be that currency, trading, traffic, marriage, anything.  You must have rules so everyone plays the game the same way.  No regulation invites chaos.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:17:45
None of the shops I like accept it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:49:00
This is true.  But very few people use it as currency.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:39:48
Because it's unregulated and they can charge what they want.  Seriously, that's the main reason why.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:46:42
Nice hips.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:33:42
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:46:16
I don't care.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:45:59
Because it's an unregulated market.  So the fees can be whatever the exchanges want them to be.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:19:47
I sold 10.  You open up shop when the shoppers come knocking.  Quick tip.. If you ever run a store and need sales to pick up, have your employees park in front.  The appearance of customers makes others come by to shop.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:42:26
So...  A savings and loan?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:32:00
Do you actually believe that load of horse shit you just spewed?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:08:55
People are getting paid. It's after the holidays. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:14:51
Uh... That's not much of a 401k.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:59:07
Wasn't that a VanHalen album title?

Your losses bend you over and fuck you.

You can only rent a hooker. Unless you marry her.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:18:00
Ok.  Can't argue that.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:56:58
The KuCoin clangs.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:52:21
All things considered, that's not very much.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:21:54
Easy way to stop overdraft fees...
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:34:41
Oil broke $70.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:45:29
The rise of the cost of the product.  The fees are a percentage. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:17:30
This kind of shit is one reason why the great depression happened and why the stock market got regulated.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:53:40
Make something no one needs.  Make them believe they do.  Sell it to them.  That's the American way.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:32:22
Dude.  This happens in every market. Makes little difference if your talking crypto, stocks, etc.  Always has, always will.  That's one way how daytraders know how much something is worth.  They watch the futures traders. And vice versa.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:23:21
Because *PEOPLE*.   And that's the best explantion you'll get.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:13:23
Neither of those are Petty blue, a 42,43,44 or 45 and none are V8 powered.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:24:41
It's nutchucking all the way around.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:16:23
They didn't actually think that far ahead.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:28:53
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:58:05
Yes. They announced it last week.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:57:11
Being regulated.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:23:03
Well so far on here it's a100% no to Bitcoin being used as a payment system.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:20:27
That's kind of how futures work...   We try to figure out what it will be worth on a certain date IN THE FUTURE and agree to by them at that price on that day.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:50:54
No regulations means you are on your own.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:34:53
Bitcoin, yes.  But there several cryptocurrencies.  It's just the first one.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:06:02
I didn't say they were.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:42:11
You're getting all hung up on the tech that created it.  Not how most people are using it.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:14:40
It tells you.  You didn't read.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:53:34
That's not how that works.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:09:48
You're funny.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:21:44
Well... It is China.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:01:17
Create, not find. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:43:06
Or just rent a hooker.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:32:42
Oppressed...  LOL
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:12:26
Typically futures bidding prices are released real time. Crypto markets are simply catching up to how other markets have done it for tens of decades.  Use it as a tool.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:57:50
Basically in order for it to work mainstream shops would need to be able to accept foreign currency.  None of the stores I shop at accep Pesos or Pounds either.  It's just too big of a pain in the ass.  You have to deal with an exchange, figure out how much it is worth today, pay all kinds of fees....
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:44:21
Above ground, or below?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:47:22
Yes.  I'll mention the crash that led to the Great Depression as an example.  Suddenly people found a new way to trade and gain wealth.  There were no regulations so people did ridicilous things.  Like trading using credit. Or borrowing against their properties. Or getting addicted to it and losing everything in the thrill of the gamble.  Much like I see some people doing with Crypto today.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:11:33
So it would be like a bank that only accepted deposits and gave loans in pesos.

Very simply put... Because people *think* it makes a difference.

Not a damn thing.

Fine. Since 1913.  Which just seems liks forever to someone born in the 60's.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:58:02
Texas did send a cease and desist order to one of the exchanges.  Not BitCoin, one of the others.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:32:06
You're overcomplicating things. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:21:48
Gold has the value we choose to place on it. Other than it's  low electrical resistance it's pretty damn useless. Well, some people think it is pretty.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:41:49
Because you have not pinned it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:06:35
I have to ask..  Why would you borrow money to buy crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:19:25
Faith.  It's backed by faith.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:39:40
Slap yourself.  Some idiot will believe that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:01:53
Fuck me. It's the 21st?  I need a day off.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:47:39
That's how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:11:26
They got bored. 
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:14:08
You can't.   It's a guess.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:40:06
And yet everything in your meme was purchased with Credit.  Go figure!
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:19:44
It's usefulness
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:53:12
No. The comment stated that it's rarity was relebant worldwide.  Fine. In that case include all the possible purchasers worldwide.  By that I mean those of us who dable across all markets.  You'll see that crypto is a very specialized market.  I see it similar to other currency markets.  In fact it behaves much in that way.  There are not that many people trading dollars for pesos.  If you take three steps back you'll see the same goes for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:22:15
Answer me a question...  
Who keeps the fee when you make a transaction through an exchange?
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:33:03
Will bitcoin work without electricity?
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:14:28
Well?  How many people are spending Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:33:19
It happened because people are gambling in an unregulated market.
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:30:26
No.  Rinse your wallet in bleach.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:20:00
She's still going to want a ring.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:11:48
Spend it.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:57:43
I can't actually hold it in my hand.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:55:53
Well?  Most people ARE buying to gamble with instead of as a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:54:27
She's still going to want a ring. It's a symbol.  Stop expecting every girl to see a ring as a material prize.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:45:46
I get to do that at work.  I use it as a game to help keep me awake.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:51:41
Anyone can get an ID. There is no age limit.  You're cheating because you are trying to avoid paying for the service provided to you at the price you agreed to.  Or did you not bother to read before you checked "agree"?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:07
Gdax is another face of Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:56:01
In theory, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:04
That annoying fucker again.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:13:22
Who said it would?  That's the risk you take with any kind of gambling.  In order for someone to make money, someone has to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:45:53
Because they have experience with bubbles.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:10:17
Because it is easy, legal gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:27
They only want regulation when it's in their benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:17
By this weekend.
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:04:15
Well let's see...  Debit cards work for shit whenever there is a thunderstorm.  Because of shittyphone lines and downed power lines.  I imagines since all you're doing with a debit card machine is transferring data that the same would apply with bitcoin.    But cash works in the dark.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:24:27
Uh, yeah. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:06:10
Yes.  It is possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:45:51
You didn't understand how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:12:42
It's normal. It can take longer. It says so in the user agreement.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:49:19
Tax it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:29:32
You are asking questions that no one can answer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:25:49
Taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:50:39
Wrong. Income is income. Regardless of age.  I've been filing taxes since I was 13.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:09:24
Except for the tax laws.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:09
Base/Dax are the same company. They are the largest company. They move the most product.  Everyone else is half a step behind them in the market and it takes them longer to catch up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:46
Never sleep
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:12
We already do.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:04
Doesn't sound too out of the ordinary.   I had one pending for 13 days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:52
I'm not wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:53
Ah, the risks of trading in unregulated markets.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:36:45
Add that to the amount you have.  Take into consideration any value changes.  That will equal the amount you spent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:30
Like the Etherium and Litecoin forks? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:36
We stopped backing the dollar with gold because we ran out of gold.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:26:04
I'm so tired of that unoriginal phrase.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:38:42
Buy money with it. Use the money to buy things.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:46:33
It's still there, Chicken Little.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:57:44
You are not always a maker.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:25:09
The people who sell it for more than they bought it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:58:49
The only thing I've witnessed it being used to buy is dollars.  So it's usability and acceptance as currency is secondary to me.  As it is for the majority.   It's nothing more than a faith based item used to make those dollars for us.  As long as it can be used for that, it will have a market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:23
We're making this shit up as we go.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:55:26
You are gambling on the price of something in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:08:32
One is a broker. The other an exchange service.   That kind of thing happens since one is slower than the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:05:59
You're fucked in 27 different ways, aren't you?   Get a job that pays in real money. Pay your taxes. Then you wont have to work this hard to keep a cell phone.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:13
OP does not like it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:26:44
It's been awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:17:02
Because they can charge what  they want.  This is unregulated.   Buyer beware. Read your agreements.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:24:24
You didn't invest.  You gambled. She didn't agree.  She gave in.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:11:13
**NOTHING**  And that's the entire joke behind Crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:23:00
A vast majority of people currently "investing" in Crypto don't care to understand how it works.  Much like stocks, bonds and normal currencies, they simply see that people find worth in them. That's really all that matters.  The perceived and accepted value, because others value it.  I'm in that group.  Group X wants to buy it. Group R wants to sell it.  I'll buy it from R, sell it to X and profit.  How it works or what it is makes little difference so long as it is legal and not too taxing on my morality. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:46:53
$10.72 sounds about right.  Fred Sanford would still complain about the price.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:54:25
It's all gambling.  It takes the same skills.  It takes me back to the penny stock days of the 80's.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:16
I know three people with $100,000.00 model T's. I prefer model A's.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:43:02
Still higher than it was 3 months ago.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:05:09
It's not.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:27:38
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:22:50
Stop trying to cheat. You always end up fucking yourself in the long run.  Get an ID. Get a bank account. Send the money to yourself. Pay the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:48
Other than people want everything free?  No, you're not missing anything.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:12:45
The vast majority don't care how it works. As long as it works.  That's one reason why cars no longer use chokes or points. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:03:06
Different words. Same meaning.  Much like when your S/O has an out of relationship sexual experience.  He/she still fucked around on you.
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:21:16
Because you are guessing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:37:17
More likely that more retarded crooks are using bitcoin.  The smart ones dont get caught.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:27:48
That's kind of the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:54:09
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:16:32
Because they are different.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:29:45
In a word, Yes. 
In more words, It's all just gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:29:19
No.  Coinbase isn't allowing it. The IRS told which files they wanted.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:34:01
Show me the oversight commission that enforces that.  You know,  the regulatory agency..
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:07:29
You know BitCoin is still being mined, right?  For 14 more years.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:54:38
Don't let Ruger see this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:58:34
 A shit load of new people are buying.  A shit load of people don't want you knowing they have it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:38:18
It never asked me for that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:42:40
Jose, your jokes are lame.
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:55:25
So you're saying that it is a commodity and not a currency.   Right?
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:17:33
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:49:47
Yes, it could.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:15:45
Because it wants to. No other reason.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:03:15
How much was your fee?  How much is it worth now compared to when you bought it?  
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:33:02
The last part is why we would still have banks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:12:15
Going into debt.  Interest.  
@_date: 2018-09-09 02:26:21
Do you honestly believe that?  Or are you repeating what you have heard?   Bitcoin can't even keep whales from fucking with its own market.  It's currency.  It'll be traded as foreign currency, that's not backed by any government.  In a situation like Venezuela ***ANY*** currency is better.  One thing Bitcoin could actually give people is the ability to move money quickly.   
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:34:18
People who bought it cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:17:05
It's unregulated.  If you want laws you need to be on the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:46:16
People cashing out for Christmas is part of the reason why there was a dump. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:16:15
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:13
Gdax/Coinbase is based in the US.  It is l larger. It is faster.  Others regularly stay behind it in price. They do catch up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:43
That's the idea.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:57:22
They lose it. Just like the people who already have.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:56
You got into it because it was unregulated.  This is how lack of regulation works.  Take your chances.  Buyer beware.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:34
Eleventeen Brazillion 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:45:00
It means they use Bitcoin to pay for nefarious goods and services and don't want to be traceable.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:32:17
LOL, the highlights are lack of regulation.  That means they can just make shit up. Like prices.
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:06:48
At least there is one other person that admits this.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:25:23
Whatever. You understand the point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:05:27
LoL. Mods are mods because they have no families.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:51:40
This was due to dictatorships, poor government management and corruption.   How would Bitcoin solve these problems?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:00:52
Because to the majority of people, the only difference is the name and the price.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:13

If the monetary system fails then Crypto is going with it.  It's just currency, nothing more. It's not some new savior.  There will be no new infrastructure with which to spend it. It's simply a new way to use the current infrastructure.   When all is said and done people will find that it's no different than buying Pesos, Francs or Pounds.

People will always use some form of government backed currency as their primary.   Why?  Because at the end of the day you want someone protecting how much your labor is worth.  Regardless of what currency you are using, it's in place of your labor.    No one wants the value of their labor to be as unpredictable and uncontrollable as BitCoin is.

Bitcoin only has value because people believe it does. It's no different in a transaction than any other form of currency.  But unlike actual currency, it doesn't work without electricity or good phone lines.

It's a piece of code that stores whoever owns or has owned it.  There is only a certain amount of it available.  People think this gives it worth.

When people started calling it an "investment" with the focus on it being a short term investment, the only thing worth focusing on became the price.

I just want them to make me money.    I flip a lot of them.   Some I keep simply because they have good returns.   Show me the returns on Crypto.

They said the same about the dollar coin.  Because it was so much more durable.    The need that crypto as a currency could have filled has been pretty much been taken care of by those little plastic rectangles we all carry.  They gave us the convenience of having currency without the hassle of actually having to carry it.    The entire idea of a universal currency free from banks and regulations?   That's a pipe dream.  We all need credit at some point.  Perhaps some day something will be a universal currency.  Right now that's being taking care of by credit cards.  I say this because I can get on line right now and buy shit in China with my bank account of American Dollars.  That little plastic rectangle takes care off all the nit picky details for me.   I can't do that with any of my Crypto.

@_date: 2019-02-01 13:56:21
You're missing my point.  Government backing or regulations mean government control.  The primary point people have been screaming about crypto is that no government could control it.  
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:06:55
   One of the selling points behind Bitcoin was that no government agency could track them.  That's why it became popular on the black market to begin with.  You don't have to keep it in traceable accounts.  You can choose to keep it in wallets and use it as currency.  How is the Gov going to know if you have a mill of bitcoin in a thumbdrive?   What you described was the buying and selling of Bitcoin as a commodity.
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:36:43
My second point was that the major users for most of bitcoins existance have been nefarious.

 *That they can hide in order to avoid paying taxes on
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:32:26

Because the entire point is to not be backed by anything that can be governed.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:20:54
The same thing that would happen if someone decided to make a shit-ton more bitcoin.   BTW there isn't even enough printed money in circulation to cover the amount of wealth owned.  So I don't see that as a problem.  They print it as they need it.    In case  you didn't know..  When you put your money in the bank it is then transferred to the FedRes.  They don't necessarily store it all.  They destroy the worn and damage currency.  They then print replacements as it is called for.   You've gotten the Feds interest rate on the money it loans to banks confused with availability of currency.

No it won't.   Money buys or controls.  It does not fix anything.  The people that have the most, will have the power.  The type of currency used makes no difference.  Taking banks out of the equation does not keep that basic truth from being.   If anything,  you've simply transferred power directly into the hands of the most wealthy with absolutely no available oversight from the people with little money.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:48:10

If you don't see how the government and taxes affect economics then you proved my point.
@_date: 2019-12-08 17:31:30
You can't value something against itself.  It's valueless at that point.  The dollar is valued against labor.  $30 equals one hour of my labor.  Is whatever I'm buying worth that much of my labor? Is that value going to remain constant enough for me to justify a purchase today?  Crypto is valued against fiat.  It it going to be worth this afternoon what it was worth this morning?   Typically that answer is No.     So crypto sucks as a currency.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:52:01
It's only real value is as a currency.  Which is part of my point.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:54:04

No.  My argument is that you can't compare commodities to currencies.   Because they are not the same thing.  
 One is a real tangible item gained through the trade of other commodities or labor.
 The other is assumed universal value based on faith that makes the trade of commodities or labor easier.

If BTC is supposed to replace real money, then why is it valued in real money?   I know how much a dollar is worth because I can compare it to my time.  I make $32 an hour. Is that $12 burger worth that much of my time?
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:51:58
So you just agreed with me?
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:28:55
So you also agreed with me.  Gold is a commodity while Bitcoin is a means of exchange.    Like all means of exchange that is not backed by a commodity,  it's value is based on the faith we have in it.   Therefore comparing gold to bitcoin is irrelevant   The post is an attempt to prove how a form of exchange is better than a commodity.    You can do things with commodities.   Take wheat as an example.  You can eat wheat.  You can't eat Bitcoin.   You can only exchange it for wheat based on the wheat holders faith in its value.    Maybe you both just missed my point, which was "Don't compare apples to oranges".

Bitcoin is also not a tangible commodity.   It's nothing more than currency.   It has no value beyond people's faith in it as currency.    Apples are being compared to Beliefs.

It's entire purpose is stored value.  Stored value is why people accept is as payment.  But it's still not a commodity.  It's a currency.  It has no value whatsoever without commodities.   Money is a go between.  You have goats. You want apples.  I have fish. I want goats.  Joe has apples. He wants fish.  Currency simply allows me to trade directly with you instead of having a three way trade with Joe.  But this only works if all three of us have equal faith in the value of the currency.    If Joe thinks your currency is shit, your money is useless.  But....  We can still make a three way trade.

It's not about age.  It's about experience and learning from it.  Debit cards aren't worth shit if the phone lines go down.   If you're dependent on technology, depend on the most reliable kind.

But a 20 in your pocket will buy you lunch.  That's not hat on BC. It's just a statement of fact.   Experience also teaches a person to not get emotionally involved in whatever the latest tech is.

I know how they work.  That was a simplistic example.  Let me dumb it down even further for you.   Last night I was on a job.  I was the only one on sight that actually lives here.  Two people were from Dallas.  14 were from either Louisiana or Mississippi. 5 were from California. 3 were from Canada. 1 was from Guatemala. 1 was from Mexico.      1 was from New York. 28 people.  Out of those 28 only three were Texan. Out of those 28 only 1 was the only Native Texan.  Out of those 28 only one lived off the job sight. Out of those 28 only one had a home within 250 miles from the job sight.   This is common.   Let me dumb it down even further.  Out of all those people working here, earning a paycheck here.   I was the only native Texan.  Everyone else was there because of work and work alone.  I'm hoping that by repeating this over and over again that you'll understand what I'm trying to say.

I'm not asking you to convince me.  I just stated that regardless of how big it is as a currency it does me just as much good as any other currency.  Which to be honest, isn't very much good.

China is a communist state.  Their economy is controlled by the government.   They already have their own currency.    Requiring people to do business in BC would devalue their currency.   They don't want their currency to lose value. They don't want to replace their currency.  
Your theory would hold more water if they were to require payment in their currency only. That would in theory help their economy. 
They haven't because in reality, they would lose customers who insist on paying in a currency that everyone already has that has been universal for eons.
It's called Credit. 
Either directly or through a creditor.

You do have to worry that said asset is going to remain a wanted item.  In the case of something that is basically nothing more than a piece of code, it's only valuable to those who believe it has value while they have the ability to trade it with others who also have the ability to trade it.

LOL.   You sound like someone who didn't live back then. You're quoting "average" prices instead of actual prices.   Cars in 1981 didn't usually come standard with things cars today do come with.  Like electric windows and air conditioning or four wheel disk brakes.  If you wanted those little accessories the price of your car was much more. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:22:21
Ask yourself something.  Why would a government require payment via a currency other than their own?  Why would China specifically?  By requiring payment through BC they would devalue their own currency.   They would also lose control of their economy.  Or had you forgotten that they are a communist government and in order for the government to survive they must have full control, including it's economy.  BT would be a danger to that control.

I value my time based on how much I make an hour.   Going out will take an hour.   It's cheaper to have it delivered.

Stop thinking of a currency as an investment.    You're basically buying Rubles because Pesos aren't valued as high as Dollars.    At the end of the day you still have to find someone who will accept it or convert it to a currency accepted wherever you are shopping at that days trading value.
