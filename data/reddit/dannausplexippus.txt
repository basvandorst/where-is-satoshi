I'm glad you used the phrase "1 whole bitcoin" because when I purchased it said I bought 0.0007355 btc. Which confused me because clearly that's not one whole unit of bitcoin. So I don't even think I have one whole bitcoin. But when I googled the exchange rate it said one bitcoin to $6,000+. So I guess my next question would be (and correct me if I'm wrong, bad at math) if $5 us dollars is used to purchase 0.0007355 worth of bitcoin does this mean 1.00 bitcoin would cost me about $1,300+?? And if I were to purchase one whole bitcoin, does this mean in exchange it would be worth upwards of $6,000?

I think I may be WAISTING my time responding. But I think its important to show you I can WAIST my time misspelling WASTE as long as I have time, energy and internet to WAIST. Maybe if this bitcoin thing works out I can start my own WASTE training company and WAIST my material to make you a trainer to slim your WASTE. Or maybe you and I could partner up to use the money to help the people WAISTING away in poverty. Maybe we can open up a community center and teach people not to WAIST skills time and resources to make their community better.
