yep, it was a much bigger hype

without revealing exact numbers, Japan just got +350%

hehe, no, we're talking about some hundreds

I see the same trend for my iPad app [Bitcoin Tracker]( Last week, 90% of downloads were from China

I like this idea, [let's try it](

3 weeks ago I was 1000th in the queue. Got rejected (not an issue now) and 1 week ago submitted again. This time, I was the 2600th.

Bitcoins finally have value because Techcrunch said so!

yeah, unfortunately it's not possible. Everything has to go over iTunes app store – and it's entirely controlled by Apple.

Facebook "won" because it transferred itself from a site to a platform. This is exactly what BTC needs now – to get more businesses adopt it, to develop tools/apps/APIs/etc. – to be a *platform*. 
I think now is simply too early to judge about its future.

hey, thanks for feedback. I just wanted to have some second screen on my desk and I found no other apps doing just that (live data like clarkmoody's)

just like for fiat, we need tools, tools, tools! I see here a lot of opportunity.
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:09:22
nope – there's really not much in it. But you can try free version first 
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:14:27
I think it's kinda matter of taste – to have everything as a web app or native. There's definitely room for both.

Thank you. Yeah, those are on my todo list
