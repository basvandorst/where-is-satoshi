In my market one would need 250-300 bitcoin for an entry level house. Each state/area is different and in my region you would need to convert it to USD for crypto for escrow. 
By doing so would want to pull enough out to also pay taxes.

Realtor here.
Cool idea - but most sellers I know would be hesitant due to volatility to fiat. It would be adding a headache for all partners involved. Especially if they were using the proceeds to make a purchase in the future, likely either having to cash to fiat (taxes) in the next transaction or make the same request to the next seller. Who could turn it down.

I can’t believe it! Never thought you’d give it up.

They’re hiding from the tax man. That’s why they both dyed their hair.

The reverse way in which you purchased in fiat.

Yes. If you transition to Fiat - goverments will follow up on profits and tax you. This should not be a surprise :).

Very true. I am not him, or interested in being him. Genuinely didn’t have a horse in the race, alas a tantrum is a tantrum. ��
