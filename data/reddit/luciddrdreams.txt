BTC is a long term storage of wealth... it may have been thought of as a medium of exchange at one point, but it is evolving. It’s becoming more of a reserve or to a lesser sense, a savings. Think of it this way... Just as a pallet of gold is much slower and expensive to move than fiat, so is BTC to other cryptos...

Don’t listen to captain contentious... I’m limiting my investments in BTC until it hits below $6k again. I believe it will sink low again and then 2018 will then be the last year you will ever see BTC below $10k. The framework and adoption of institutional investor is in place, tons of hedge funds were created specifically for crypto over the past 6-8 months... everyone is holding their breath &amp; it will be worth the wait. If the $5k dip happens, it will be very short lived. If we hit below $6k, I have prepared to increase my position very quickly. To each his own! ��

Eventually! Lol. I also figure my gesture would go a far way and also get one more person interested. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:30:27
I would give a short background on Bitcoin including the creation and what it is. There are some good videos out there that are under 2min showing a more laments way of explaining. There was a really good one around Dec-Jan 17.
Then, I would give them a bit of perspective on the direction and current growth of the blockchain space such as Platforms and dApps built on those platforms.  
Being the first, I would consider Ethereum as my focal point. 
Next, I would probably explain the mediums of exchange on Exchanges. I would probably talk about the crypto exchange history including the failure of Mt Gox and then touch on a few current exchanges. I would share and illustrate how Fee Split Exchanges like BiBox, Binance, KuCoin, and Coss work.
Lastly, I would explain the most important part in deciding to enter this space, which is Crypto Storage and Wallet Security. I would give a few examples, show them how 2FA and storing Private and Public Keys work, including the importance and role of each.
Hope this helps!

I think it is more about financial freedom by removing banks and limiting government in transactions and furthermore, financial well being.

It’s actually called business and the freedom to conduct your business however you please. 
Now, if the mechanic or I was a government backed organization or person on behalf of, then it would be illegal. 
Just as if a restaurant is allowed to charge VIP service and quicker seating based off of how much, a patron is willing or going to spend, any other non government business/ person can expedite clients services in the same ideology. I was willing to pay more, and in a more attractive, creative way...
Even amusement parks have priority passes they sell that allow you to expedite your wait ahead of others in line.... so, definitely not illegal

Sorry to hear this but maybe find a tactic and stick with it. Imagine how many people kick themselves for not buying Apple, google, Amazon, etc.... or worse; sold their position. Aside from investing in BTC, I have found great success investing in Platforms and Fee Split Exchanges. There are more wasteland projects out there than legitimate projects, but those few small projects will usher in a new era of wealth, technology, and changes to daily life most people can’t even imagine. 
Good luck man!

I did, and I printed him 2 copies of his private keys and public, then 1 separate of his public so he can load more on if he wants. The wallet has all the instructions he needs and I told him to call me if he needs anything.

Yeah, but I did it more for the novelty.
Fee was $0.20 for the transaction but they always charge a higher price for your crypto than the actual market price. 
Btc was basically $8,420 in market, but they were selling it for $8,942 at the time I purchased. You can zoom in on the photo.

I used the bitcoin org free wallet generator and direct printed the wallet, screen shot only the deposit QR code and folded it up and gave it to him. I sent the bitcoin to him in front of him from my coinbase.

It was more a figure of speech illustrating its popularity. I’m sure they have plenty of customers, but I will say, I found the atm by chance.
The location of the BTC atm is not marketed too well. I’m sure the atm would be even more beneficial to their business if marketed further on google and Yelp.

@_date: 2018-08-31 12:01:18
I snapshot the QR code with the address of my wallet with my phone and then edit the picture to write the name of the exchange or wallet and the coin. This makes it much easier to identify when at the BTM.
I also always snap a photo of the transaction receipt/ confirmation. I’ve had BTC take several hours before where as ETH was about 15min and TRX and OMG were under 5min.
There is usually a customer support number on the BTMs and if you know the brand, they probably have a reddit and Facebook page.

If 98% of all coins crashed today, there would still be about 32 viable coins. I invest in Platforms because I want to own the tollways, the other coins are the cars traveling on the tollway paying the fees. I invest in exchanges because they give the largest spread of diversification of all coins. I look at my approach as more of a calculated risk. However, we could all wake up tomorrow and the whole cryptoverse could be collapsed... unlikely at this point, but anything is possible. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:07:51

I second this especially learning how to secure your investment and private keys. 
I would add that if you do venture in to other areas, look at FSA (fee split allocation) exchanges that provide a dividend across each coin traded on their platform &amp; then look in to PoS (proof of stake) coins that provide passive income even when market is down. Still, always do your own research and understand the ‘tokenomics’ of each coin you decide to invest in. 
FSA &amp; PoS are nice to see generating passive coin income regardless of market conditions ;)
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:56:41
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:47:50
I like FSA because it’s spreading risk, plain and simple.
As for PoS coins, I wouldnt go as far as saying they are all a scam... I would agree in highly speculative, but isn’t the whole cryptospace!? I feel more comfortable investing in OS mainnet coins that are PoS than any other PoS coin. Sure just because a coin is characterized as PoS, doesn’t in itself make it a better investment, but that’s why the tokenomics are important. Also, PoS is proving to be less centralized than PoW especially as mining difficulties in a coin increase and push miners in to mining pools that grow into large centralizers.

I do somewhat agree with your point and btc may not be the right candidate as a global currency, however, deflationary currencies would work if they were the primary form of compensation for products or services. 
You’re right why spend $5 today if it will be worth more tomorrow? This is subjective because at the moment you look at it as an investment you don’t want to spend because you have to take fiat, convert it to said digital currency, and then spend digital currency. It’s unattractive to spend if you believe it will increase in value when acquiring it with a form of payment that is going the opposite direction with inflation.
However, if the form of compensation for your services or a product you provide originates as a deflationary digital currency, then you have a system of replenishing that wealth and lose incentive to just hodl.
Really, what happens is the cost of living, products, and services become inflationary. 
Ie: If I was just paid a $1200 btc paycheck for my time and services at a job, and I go home see a cool product commercial, need to have said product that costs $200 btc today, depending on how bad and fast I want the product, I will either buy today for $200 btc, or decide I will buy it for less tomorrow knowing that 1) my digital currency will be replaced via my job, 2) the cost of that product will diminish more the longer I’m willing to wait to buy it. 
Obviously, whomever adopts the digital currencies sooner will experience tremendous wealth at first by way of hyper deflation, but as widespread adoption occurs, it will step down to deflation and over time where as stated above, products and services would continue to be inflationary. This would include your compensation for whatever your job was. 
The current system has us all fooled that as time goes by and technology increases, things should cost more. This is the vail that has been pulled over our eyes.

Basically, the fed reserves ability to print money unrestricted, causes inflation. The cost of living including groceries, gas, housing, etc hasn’t changed much over the course of the past 80+ years, even with technological advancements. In fact, the opposite should occur in regards to the cost of these advancement. The only thing that has change is the value of the dollar.... this is driven by intentional hyperinflation caused by the wealthiest banking families of the world. 
This is why $25 not too many years ago could fill your shopping cart, but today, that equates to a handful of items. 
With bitcoin, the valuation is the exact opposite... you can’t just create more bitcoins to deceive and rape the citizens... its more transparent, accountable, and valuable than fiat. 
Nobody but the fed reserve (a privately held, nongovernmental organization) and the crony mobster politicians actually know how much usd is actually printed and in circulation.
The books are cooked. We all live in and feed a lie.

Back up your keys at least 2 different ways. Don’t ever share how much you own. Don’t keep photos of your keys on a cell phone or cloud. Do store any written keys inside of a plastic ziplock bag and then inside a firesafe bag, &amp; if possible, then inside a fire rated safe bolted to the floor.

I agree that RVer is trying to mislead. It is a classic bait and switch. It’s fine if you support bitcoin cash, but don’t mislead. 
This tactic he is using to increase the bitcoin cash user/investor base is definitely along the lines of a scam. I’m not saying BCH is a scam, but the methods RVer is using is misleading and wrong. I own BCH, but only by way of fork. I have no interest in this chain outside of holding the free fork drop atm. 
In all honesty, if I were to adopt the idea of using both BTC and BCH, I would consider BTC as my store of wealth and BTH as my daily spending. 
To claim BCH is the real BTC is just scammy.
