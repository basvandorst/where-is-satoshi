You make a good point about complexity.  But ethereum offers an alternative in that the complexity is decentralized where bitcoins additional complexity promotes centralized services(for now).
  
The above contradicts your statement that it can be done better, more efficiently and securely.  Wouldn't a decentralized solution be more efficient and secure if implemented correctly?

Going forward, I expect to see you protesting any submission about projects crowd sourced using bitcoin.  If you don't, then you are a hypocrite.
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:32:47
You should look through my history, we don't disagree, I am also interested in ethereum and do not believe it should be suppressed in because I believe it affects bitcoin and was essentially birthed from it.
  
My reply was merely a matter of fact.  Feel free to refute those facts.  The fact is that there is no working product yet which creates suspicion and Vitalik has caused a rift with his invention of bitcoin maximalism.  This creates more FUD than there should be and causes blow-back.  And then, of course, there are the mindless followers on both sides which fuel the fire.

The most insidious part is the implication that you have to choose between the two.

You didn't put any restrictions or qualify your original comment.  You said "if you have a gun, bring it".

Either way, it's not worth risking your life for some bits.

I offered an explanation and asked for clarity.  I'm not sure how email headers is relevant here, he likely provided his location information when he actually signed up and tried to verify his account after they sent the invite.  I really doubt they sent invites to anyone who asked for one using a .pk address.

It would take someone explaining why it is useless in a way that people can understand.  Can you do that?  I've yet to see a single solid argument for it being vaporware.  It is complex at its core whereas bitcoin is simple and solid.  Ethereum has a lot to overcome if it is to succeed but its complexity offers a lot and should not be ignored.  Its complexity can also be its undoing.  It's going to be awesome to watch.  We are watching tools being built that will affect humanity for years to come.

You would have been better off spending the couple dollars on actual bitcoin or getting a casascius if you can afford one.  You can buy those in bulk from china and they aren't worth squat.

Didn't they fund the whole project using Bitcoin?

Because they can't tell where you live by your email?  Does your email end in .pk or are you using something like gmail? ;)

Coinbase is a very safe way to buy bitcoins.  They are as legit as any bank and go out of their way to comply with regulations.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:46:33
The thing to remember is that Ethereum hasn't produced a working product yet.  And Vitalik has created a rift by inventing "bitcoin maximalism".  A completely absurd term that applies more to his blind followers than to the greater bitcoin ecosystem.  
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:22:23
Ethereum is much more than an alt coin.  Just like bitcoin has and will continue to grow to be more than just a token.  But, whatever, I'll leave you to your bias.  Enjoy your ignorance.

[From Wikipedia:](
  
War on Bitcoins is an American term commonly applied to a campaign of prohibition of Bitcoins, military aid, and military intervention, with the stated aim being to define and reduce the illegal Bitcoin trade.[5][6] This initiative includes a set of Bitcoin policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of what participating governments and the UN define as illegal psychoactive Bitcoins. The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by United States President Richard Nixon—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Bitcoin Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared Bitcoin abuse "public enemy number one". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the "prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted", but that part did not received the same public attention as the term "war on bitcoins".[7][8][9] The Bitcoin Policy Alliance estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on the War on Bitcoins.[10]

It's called a pump.  This is Garza buying his own crap to pump it.

Yes, it does. And again, your analogy is incorrect, those are separate languages.  The language we are communicating with is the product of decentralization, it is a living language that is constantly evolving.

How about you start with zero credit and see how you like it.  Or miss a bill because something bad happens in your life and end up getting punished for it.  It is an oppressive system that only serves the most advantaged.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:15:19
You have protections with ACH.  They don't accept CC as the main form of payment because by the time the fraud is found, the criminals have the bitcoin and bitcoin is irreversible.  By accepting CC for bitcoin, they would be attracting a lot of fraudsters.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:55:28
You're not really making the case for ethereum being redundant and unnecessary.
  
I've shown a big contrast between bitcoin and ethereum regarding decentralization.  Bitcoins complexity currently comes at the cost of what makes it appealing and reliable at its core.  Whereas ethereum may overcome that.
  
Can we get back on track and have you show why ethereum is possibly redundant?  Because your example of languages is just wrong, we are communicating using a decentralized and living language.

You don't seem to realize that by filtering out relevant topics like Ethereum, you are creating a circlejerk.

This is fucking terrible advice. If you have a gun, bring it?  Are you fucking serious?  Do you know what the consequences are for unlicensed concealed carry?  The law aside, if they have a gun too, it is not worth risking your life for some bitcoin.

Interestingly, the one I trust the least in that list is also the one I trusted the most during the gox days.

High fraud with credit cards.  With ACH, the risk of fraud is lower for them.  You're not giving your bank routing number to people, you're giving it to a business that is strictly regulated.  It's like giving it to any other company that you want to pay bills using ACH.  There are protections for both sides.

Can you show me the decentralized turing complete option with counterparty?
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:05:04
This appears to have gone over your head.  The implication is that you can't trust both, you have to choose one or the other.  Notice the use of the word 'or'.
  
Also, the split you speak of might have nothing to do with your trust in either and everything to do with your financial situation.

~~I think I need to catch-up on counterparty then.  I remember there being something about the counterparty.io nodes having power to blacklist any subsequent node that comes after.~~
  
Yep, you appear to be right, counterparty is decentralized but now I'm struggling to find the incentive for running a node in the first place.
