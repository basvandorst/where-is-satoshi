How does this not have more attention?

Cryptocurrency provides freedom and freedom comes with mistakes. Ponzi schemes are inevitable in this sphere. Humor can be an effective way to educate New comers about the dangers of crypto Ponzi schemes

With permissioned blockchains you can fudge the middle

Yes! I HATE it when people use linear regression for total market cap. Logarithmic regression is a much better model

I'm wondering if an open DAO could sell private keys

Bitcoin is freedom. Freedom to succeed or fail
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:35:37
Lighting is great if you start out having BTC, but what if you want to own less than the given transaction fee amount. Let's say 100 Satoshi. If you bought private keys holding 100 Satoshis through a different medium, say Ethereum, than that might be cheaper. Again, I don't know I'm just wondering
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:12:57
Do you think it could be logically possible for an open DOA, that's probably securely, to sell private keys?

Fuck tether 
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:31:23
I'm just as clueless as the next guy on the details of this tech, but I am just wondering if there might be a market need to securely exchange BTC private keys on other protocols.
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:06:28
I know, this is a sad attempt to cling to power
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:08:26
Yeah, but there has to be an inflection point. What does your model prediction for 2141?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:57:59
There has to roughly predict where the inflection point is given energy prices, limited supply, limited users, or something else.

@_date: 2018-06-06 15:56:02
Yeah, now that I am thinking about it, there is no way to garuntee that the seller of a private key hasn't copied it.

I wonder if BTC stocks will keep there value. Who's the CEO again?
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:20:30
This was a very thoughtful post. I hope people read it before becoming defensive. I also think it is possible for BTC to fail. If the price of BTC drastically drops below what is profitable to mine, then miners will stop mining and BTC will fail. However, I choose to put 50% of my assets in BTC and ETH because I think the network effect (Metcalf's Law) will be stronger than superior blockchain tech. I can also afford to lose that much money because 1. I'm poor and 2. I'm young
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:24:17
Just wondering
