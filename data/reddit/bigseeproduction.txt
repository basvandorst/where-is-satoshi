I bought at least 20 games there (Steam Keys) and all worked, so nothing to worry about! Just look at the number of sells of the seller and you will be fine.

I would never buy a windows key from them. They also sold (maybe still sell) malwarebytes anti-malware keys, probably some unlimited ones (found some on a website which all worked) edit: these keys were patched some months ago after about 2 years

Do you still know what game? G2A always tells you what kind of key it is (Steam, CD-Key (with special instructions), Rockstar (eg for GTAV) etc)
