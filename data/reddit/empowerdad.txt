So, if something is paying into the address, it would be best not to use it. I use a bitcoin QT wallet for all that stuff, does each wallet address have a different key?

This is because one of the co-founders of chess.com is huge on bitcoin. He recently started [gambit - click here for info]( 
From what I've gathered he will promote gambit on chess.com and exercise.com as he is co-founder of both. He was also involved in 'ladders' back in the day which was tourneys on yahoo games.

As a poker play (online/live), I learned a long time ago that I don't have to tell the bank anything. I've staked people in the past and had to wire them money from bofa and have had the teller ask me questions. I basically tell them it's my business and that's it. If they dig further I explain that I pay taxes and don't need to go into the private details on what I do with MY MONEY. I've also gotten questioned about numerous wires hitting my account. I tell them it's my business. If they don't like it I'll close my accounts and take my business somewhere else. 
tl,dr - fuck banks

I cashed out yesterday as we were approaching the all time high again. If I wasn't asleep earlier I may have bought back in. Hate missing these swings!
