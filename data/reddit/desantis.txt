Various people have asked me about BitGo's security the past few days. I'm skeptical of Bitfinex's configuration, not BitGo's platform.
See Emin's tweet:

API Key, Private Key and Account Name.
Nothing but failed attempts thus far.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:12:20
So you are saying Bitfinex's API key was compromised? Isn't Bitfinex suppose to secure that key?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:39:55
The policies were always there, it was Bitfinex's job to apply them to individual wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:39:16
There are when you apply policy rules to your account.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:54:38
We have no reason to believe that BitGo's setPolicyRule API call doesn't work as described.

Steal my bitcoin; show me an exploit on BitGo's end.
Mike Belshe stated on the 4th that "BitGo['s] systems were not breached in this attack and [their] software functioned correctly."
If you don't set a policy to limit the amount of bitcoin (per day) that can be withdrawn from your account, then complete drainage of your account is correct behavior.

Here's your API key, sir: 627e0c5ea7b3e890743434768506b3ac36d96a40dd6830f6256228cdc2bcba3d

Personally I am framing them but I would say archival sleeves!

If you are willing to buy archival sleeves I would say no.

Someone added the patent to  a while back. The site hasn't been updated since Charlie Shrem was arrested; I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of misinformation published by the mainstream media is sourced from abandoned projects like this. The entry:

Satoshi Nakamoto... the legend
According to legend, Satoshi Nakamoto began working on the Bitcoin concept in 2007. While he is on record as living in Japan, it is speculated that Nakamoto may be a collective pseudonym for more than one person.
August 15, 2008
An interesting patent application...
Neal Kin, Vladimir Oksman, and Charles Bry file an application for an encryption patent application. All three individuals deny a connection to Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged originator of the Bitcoin concept.

Working on it now, will report back when I get a confirmation.

SegWit can't be used as an excuse after it is used. If miners aren't profiting following a fork, and developers find themselves limited due to the block size: they could easily work together on a sidechain that solves this problem. If the resulting sidechain provides value to the rest of the network, everyone else will join them. Fork avoided, and the price goes to the moon due to a smooth transition (not a fork resulting in uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:50:11
Well you have to remember that SegWit isn't designed to prevent on-chain scaling, it's a fix to tx malleability, and it's a fix that happens to also solve the debate issue of "blocks being full." Miner's have an opportunity to increase their earnings via merge mining sidechains, and as lightning nodes. If after the activation of SegWit all participants within the network were on the same page, and miners were actually being cheated out of earnings, we'd have a "new problem" to solve (and as a network we would solve it). As it stands miners have profited from the debate, and have not made an effort to educate us re: their grievances (for two years). We want an educated network moving forward, not one where there is confusion regarding code forks, hard forks, soft forks, user forks, code forks that turn into alts, chain forks which increase supply, and block size increases vs tx count increases.
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:03:17
You're right, I'd rather see a day in which Bitcoin ceases to exist than to see the block size increased in such a way that full nodes are pushed out in favor of politicians like Falkvinge.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:28:21
Seeing as SegWit already increases the effective block size (via optimization) to [2MB under normal conditions]( and [3.7MB when the network is spammed,]( a 2MB HF + SegWit would multiply the number of txs (not add). 2MB - 3.7MB is actually 4MB - 7.4MB w/ the HF, not 4MB from a 2MB BU bump + another 2MB via SegWit. SegWit is a one time optimization, changing the constant value (BU) can happen an "unlimited" number of times. So while a 2MB bump may not push out nodes *today,* it does increase the number of txs per block from 1MB to 4MB - 7.4MB w/ most users believing there was only a 2MB increase. So let's say it went through, and within a few months a bump to 4MB was pushed... Now we are talking 8MB - 14.8MB blocks with the users thinking they're at 4MB. No matter what the block size is, the blocks will fill up, and before long these little changes will add up (eventually changing the entire system). If this was about scaling the miners would have activated SegWit, and if it failed to deliver on scalability the block size would w/o a doubt have been increased at a later date. This debate isn't about scalability though. You have the dual economic / technical aspects of Bitcoin to account for. If "startup CEOs" (who don't run full nodes) believe they're getting 8MB tx performance from a 2MB bump they will demand that the block size increases until there are no full nodes left; if all of this happens Bitcoin starts to change rapidly (which isn't what we want from a decentralized system who chief feature is consistency and integrity); with each change the disconnect between users grows into mass confusion, and ultimately I believe it would lead to a collapse (or a lot of users believing they're using a decentralized system when in fact it will have evolved into a very centralized one).

because it is a good proof of concept, particularly when you can leverage WebRTC.
EDIT: I hate JavaScript by the way.
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:00:52
That is a fair opinion and I agree with you: some people do over promise and never or under deliver. But what I can tell you is that there are 100s if not 1000s of people like me and my team who wake up at 6:30 every morning and work until around 1AM doing whatever it takes to keep delivering and to keep moving things forward. Sometimes we screw up but we learn, and not everyone makes it.

I'm going to dockerize the proof of concept later next week! So you will be able to at the click of a button.

Of course it is. Open source software is a global collaborative effort. Projects you and I have never heard of are likely to pop up in a year or two and forever change how we think about a particular problem.
For instance: Mike Belshe the CEO of BitGo is the lead writer of the current HTTP/2 spec ( and the current HTTP status code 402: Payment Required is reserved for future use. He could potentially add the bitcoin protocol to every major web browser in existence, solving a whole separate subset of issues.
We got our own unicode character... Anything can happen as far as I am concerned.

I truly consider myself lucky to have two co-workers / former roommates / best friends who I talk Bitcoin with from dusk to dawn every single day.
Outside of them I have found in multiple cities there exists sects of people just like us. If you look, you will find them! The ones I have found have quickly become great friends, I'll be in one of their weddings later this year actually.
Find a local meet up for any tech related thing and bring up BTC! Won't take you long! I also spend a good bit of time in the IRC, trolls here and there, but otherwise some great late night conversations have arose from there.

something I bought at $0.07, sold at $0.19 and am kicking myself for not holding...
EDIT: Seriously though they are an ecommerce website (originally at least) that reverse merged onto the market last year. They bought btcs.com and then started investing in various bitcoin startups (GoCoin, Gem, CoinOutlet, ExpressCoin). Their stock skyrocketed after they bought a new facility and traded stock to Spondoolies for miners (doubling their mining capacity).
