Agreed. They can shove their "network fee" directly up their ass.

This is great news! Bitpay had a golden opportunity and shat on it, much like Coinbase is doing. Whoever replaces them and maintains ethical behavior is gonna be mega rich.

Theyre all fucking criminals and psychopaths. Why do we still let them do this Shit? I mean, they're completely outnumbered.
Like just this past month, Trump gives his corporate buddies a reach around on their corporate taxes and in the same bill completely fucks over crypto traders by closing the like kind loophole. 
I think they're seeing the writing on the wall. Crypto threatens their very existence. You can try, you motherfuckers, but Bitcoin is gonna eat your lunch.

Which is why we wait until times like the present and consolidate those inputs with a low fee.

To all those asking about LN: Just download the testnet binaries and play with it. It's really fucking fast and really fucking cool. If you download the packaged lightning app, you can do test txs with bitrefill and starblocks, and open channels with other testnet nodes.

No no no. Don't move the goalposts. I have no problem contributing, but taxes aren't contributions. Taxes are extortion. Contributions are voluntary. Taxes are collected with the threat of violence if I choose not to pay. That's the difference. 
If the government said "Hey, we have a great idea to feed the homeless. Donate to this fund if you would like to feed the homeless with your 'tax contribution'." that would be fine. 
What they do though, is TAKE your money and do whatever the fuck they want with it, and if you choose to not pay it, men with guns and blue uniforms will be at your door to take you and throw you in a cage.

I ran into this too. Pretty shitty of them to make it mandatory. And no, it doesn't save fees. It causes an extra fee. I was charged a $17 "network fee" and the normal miner fee of $30ish dollars. Bitpay is dead to me and I had used them since 2011/2012. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:53:35

How does gocoin compare to coinpayments. I was using coinpayments, but they are closing soon.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:58:16
There are similarities in Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism. The main difference being Libertarians condone a minimal amount of State, Anarcho-Capitalism does not. Most Libertarians eventually find their way to Anarcho-Capitalism fairly quickly. Once you realize how little the State is actually needed(it's not), it becomes clear that even a little State is incompatible with Liberty.
Edit: There's also a difference in Rothbardian Libertarianism and what the LP calls Libertarianism.

When you click split it makes a new wallet for bch. Then you can copy the address, go back to main, send your bch to the address in the "split" wallet. You don't have to though. You can send bch directly from main.

Argh, I earned 12 throughout 2011 and 2012 when BTC was around $12, selling stuff on bitmit. I went shopping in 2013/14 when it first hit $1000. Silly me thought I could catch the bottom and buy back in and waited way too long. Ah well. I still got back in at $795 in late Jan/ early Feb of this year. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:28:25
Fees are .24% taker and 0% maker. If you look for places to sell or buy where there isn't an offer already, you will be the offer maker an pay no fee.  If you take the same offer as someone else or do market orders, you pay the .24% taker fee. On a $1000 coin, if you buy or sell as a market order, the fee would be $2.40 taker fee. Just keep that in mind.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:48:08

@_date: 2017-01-24 21:53:46
Cool, I made a little bit shorting yesterday. I got out at $922 and my limit buy filled this morning at $902�� We could reach the $890s again, but I'm not holding out for that. If it does I'll probably grab some more discounted coin.

@_date: 2017-01-21 12:35:58
I really like bitsquare. I sold a little bit on it at 1% markup. The only thing that was scary, is clearxchange takes a week to deposit funds after a sale, and for the US, it's clearxchange or a bank transfer. At least clearxchange is irreversible. It's still a faster way to buy coins than coinbase. Even my "instant buy" from coinbase with credit card is taking 5 days. Bitsquare is exactly what we've all been clamoring for since the debacle at MtGox, now all you fuckers need to use it.�� Decentralized currency belongs on a decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:47:18
Yeah, I didn't see it until I had already clicked confirm. I don't know why the "high" fee was that low.

Has anyone tried to move all their coins on ledger to a segwit address? I tried on my nano s last night. The highest fee was 23 cents(5170 satoshies), but it still hasn't made it into a block(17 hours). I hope my btc isn't stuck for 3 days.

You might say that that is immoral, or even robbery. I would too! Even if crooks in suits do it. Theft is theft. It doesn't matter who you are.

The rule of law isn't about morality; it's about the letter of the law. Morality is and will always be relative. There is no room for relativity  in justice. 
Morality is not subjective. Something is either moral or immoral.


Um, I specifically said **we** for a reason. The collective does know how to run your life better than you do in certain ways. For instance; the collective believes you should save for retirement. It makes sure you do that by taking some of your pre-tax income and setting it aside for you. The collective does that to ensure it doesn't become wholly responsible for you in your old age. Pretty much everything else about society follows that same vein. If you don't want to be beholden to your fellow citizens, as I keep saying, please leave. 
Wow, just wow.... so mob rule is OK. Got it. 


Mmm, the difference between slavery and non-slavery is whether you're a voluntary participant, not the percentage of your labor that's redirected to other ends. If you choose to unvolunteer, you can do that. 
No, you can't unvolunteer. If you do, men with guns will kidnap you and throw you in a cage. If you resist the kidnapping, they will murder you. Any amount above 0 is slavery by definition. The fruits of our labor are being taken to benefit somebody else.


That's a different conversation, but working based on the ideals of the system, they represent us, yes.
No, they don't. They do the bidding of the highest bidder.  


Again, morality is  subjective and unrelated to the rule of law. 
No, it isn't.  An action is either moral or immoral. If something is subjective, it's a preference, not a moral principle.


Again, no, we don't. 
Again, yes we do. Less than 1/4 of Americans vote, and they are split almost 50/50 between 2 candidates. 


Is it my problem that the whole world operates like this? No sir. If you want to live somewhere without these rules, you can do that. Set up a shack in Somalia and have at it. Again, this is strictly voluntary. 
Why should I have to leave. You're the one advocating violent domination of a whole country. You leave, I hear China has lots of Communism. What does how the world operates have to do with me seeing it as moral or immoral?


Again, morality is subjective. You cannot argue, in a court of law, based on morality. You can do that in a political forum where the law is made, but certainly not in a courtroom. Also, the fact that you're slandering the impressive nature of the judiciary is pretty sad. 
Again with the religious dogma. Courts aren't infallible. Judges aren't superhuman deities. They enforce the scribbles of politicians, right or wrong. My point was, it would be a waste of time to sue the government in a government court.


So, instead of working to change that via the system that's in place to create change; you're going to sit on the outside and whine? How is that productive. Whether you want to or not, the maintenance of your citizenship is defacto support for the violent domination you despise. Your very existence is tacit support. 
No, the "system" is inherently immoral. I want no part of it. What you're saying is the slaves supported slavery because they didn't escape. They should have voted harder to change the system.


Mmm, no. Progressive ideals came first and set up the infrastructure that allowed technological development. It's even obvious from the historical record that this is so. 
Wrong. Government creates nothing. Man created technological advances. Government just taxed the shit out of it.


Is the collective America not godlike? Really? We're pretty much omnipotent on this planet. We certainly know most things that are going on. We have the power to obliterate everything if we wanted to. We, the collective, are immortal as well; since ideas cannot die. We check many of the boxes for "deity". 
That's seriously a fucked up worldview. I am glad you said this though, "ideas cannot die". The idea of Freedom and liberty is what I aim to keep alive. I've only responded thus far, because I hope I can convey these ideas in a way that you might think about it and the light bulb might flicker on. You own yourself. Anyone who takes part of your life or labor with the threat of violence if you don't comply, is immoral and a tyrant. Even if they want to do good things with your money, it's still immoral to steal. If taking 100% of someone's labor is slavery, so is taking 1% or 50% or whatever. Duping 51% of the population into believing you have the right to steal from everybody in no way makes it a moral action. Theft is theft.

Roads don't require theft of a nation to be built. There are many privately built roads and guess what, the builders even let everybody drive on them. You're telling me, people build cars with thousands of parts, but we never could've figured out a way to put asphalt on the ground to drive on without government?!
NASA also could've been funded by donations, but the government decided it could just steal some more money and be the sole payer. Is SpaceX stealing from you to build rockets? What about Virgin? 
We live in a quasi-Capitalist economy. Laissez-faire Capitalism would ensure that the best ideas/companies profited and continued. This crony Capitalist economy ensures that whoever donates to the politicians will get tons of funding, go bankrupt, and keep all the loot. Solara comes to mind, but I'm sure the list is too long to recite.

The government does effectively take 60% or more of our labor. Income Tax, Social Security Tax, Property Tax, Sales Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Sin Tax, literally every thing is taxed. The taxes don't go towards upkeep of anything. Government prints every dollar it spends out of thin air. The taxes collected go straight to the Federal Reserve Bank to (attempt to) pay interest on the National Debt(money that's been printed and spent already).

I wasn't making a jab at your intelligence, but a jab at my ability to accurately convey my thoughts. You keep using this word voluntary, but there is nothing voluntary about 1/2 of your paycheck being taken before you even get it. If his system is so voluntary, then there should be no problem here right? Those who want to pay for the nanny state can, and those who don't should be left alone. That's not how it works. You said it yourself, if you unvolunteer, you lose your rights and have to leave. That's not voluntary. That's forced inclusion. 
Again, you assume I have a problem with the services of the government, but it's the FORCE that I find immoral. All these things that are so great would be funded in a truly free society....voluntarily. Great ideas shouldn't require theft and coercion to become reality. The shitty ones do though. 
I'll repeat, my problem is not with the services, my problem is with stealing from everybody to fund them. I don't see why that's so radical or scary. If something is worth doing, it would be done in a free society.

Uh, yes they do. Police Officers have the right to arrest you. The IRS has the right to Tax you. The Fish and Game Service has the right to kick you off federal land. 
Umm, no they don't. They only get away with these immoral actions, because people like you believe them to be somehow different than the rest of us. You hallucinate them to be deities that morality doesn't apply to.


The enforcers of the law aren't the ones who wrote it. **We all** think we know how to run your life better than you. 
What?! You can run MY life better than ME, Massah?  Sorry, you own yourself and not even 1% of anybody else's life.


Mmm, we'll have to disagree. There's a fundamental difference between interpersonal behavior and the framework of civilization. It's immoral for me to use force on you. It's not immoral for the state to. 
Wrong. It's still an immoral action. You can't change morality no matter how hard you vote.


Yes, actually. You didn't even do the bare minimum that a citizen is expected to. You are *literally* irrelevant. 
Ok.... Slavery is immoral, but I didn't vote for slavery, so I can't say anything.... that's your logic? You're really revealing a lot about yourself today.


What a terrible analogy. Not only is taxation hilariously unrelated to slavery; the point is that non-voters have no right to question the consequences of votes. 
I bet you'd agree that taking 100% of someone's labor is slavery. At what % is it no longer slavery? I'll give you the answer. It's 0....0% is the correct answer.


Um, yes we did. That's how representative democracy works. 
They don't represent me, nor do they represent you. They do as the highest bidder tells them to, but keep telling yourself that.


Again, it's like you don't get how this works. 
??? I can't even....


Hawkward that we don't live in direct democracy for exactly this reason. It's technically a constitutional republic. 
Both are immoral. 51% can't turn an immoral action into a moral one. Violent domination of the minority by the majority IS immoral. 


Well good thing it doesn't work like that.
No, what we have is 51% of 10% of the population violently dominating the other 95%. Groovy.... 


I mean, you might not have consented but the founders did. Your citizenship is a defacto continuous acceptance. Feel free to relinquish it at any time. 
There's some logic. This plantation beats the slaves every day. I should move to the next plantation where they only beat the slaves once a week instead of trying to tell the other slaves that slavery, and especially violently dominating them, is wrong. Good plan.


They volunteered. 
They were duped. They were sold the same lies you're spouting here. THEY HATE US FOR OUR FREEDOMS!


I take the responsibility of power very seriously, but this is a different conversation that the one we're having about the role of government. 
Fair enough.


If they do, feel free to take them to court. 
You mean the courts that they control?  The courts that say whatever immoral thing they try to pass is perfectly moral and just? Sure.


Feel free to engage in politics, Mr. Non-Voter. 
That would be immoral! I don't want to violently dominate ANYONE! What do you think I've been saying all along?


No sir. I prefer modern society because I think the progression of the systems of laws we use to maintain stable civilization is better now than it has ever been. The technology is just a symptom of the thing I like most: progress. 
The progress is due to technology, not governmental interference. 


Which is why we live in a constitutional republic that has freedom of religion. No one is a god, because *we* are. 
I don't even know wtf that's supposed to mean. *we* are most definitely not gods.

Bitcoin has low fees. I've often sent less than 0.0001 btc as a fee. Monero fees are 0.02 xmr. The difference is in the market price of Cryptos.

What a load of tripe. 
1. They do NOT have special  rights. They think they know how to run our lives better than we do. By the way. If something is immoral for you to do, its immoral for somebody else to do it, even if you do vote for them to.
2. No, I didn't vote for a single one of them. That means I can't speak out against injustice? That makes no sense. I guess you think people who didn't own slaves shouldn't have spoken against it either. That's the logic in that statement.
3. No, we didn't decide it. It was signed by a crooked president while congress was on holiday. No, we didn't decide the rate either. Those same criminals do. 
Ah Democracy, you mean mob rule. Hate to break it to you, but immoral is still immoral, even if 51% vote for it. What, the other 49% just don't matter? At all? 51% might vote to steal 100% of the 49%'s wealth, but that doesn't make it moral.
3. There was no consent. That's bullshit. The criminals are sending our kids to die for what? Some oil? Some poppies? The petrodollar scam? Get real. Maybe it has something to do with Saudi Arabia wanting to run a pipeline where Russia's pipeline already is. Wake up. Its the same tired old scam that the sheeple fall for every time. THEY HATE US BECAUSE MUH FREEDOM!
4. Yes, we do have rights, and the government infringes on them constantly AND they get away with it, because people HALLUCINATE them to have rights that NO other humans have. Again, that's called religion. People do not attain super human rights because you put an R or a D after their name. Even if 99% vote for them to do some immoral thing, that does not suddenly, magically make it a moral action. 
You prefer modern society to historical society because of our technological advances, not because of government. Please don't conflate the two. We have these advances in spite of government interference, not because of it. Humans are an amazing and adaptive species, but we cannot be deities, no matter how hard you vote for it.

Most banks don't even have a 3% reserve. Some are under 1%. Most money in our accounts never existed. When you deposit $100, they lend out over $90. When that $90 is deposited by those borrowers, over 90% of it is loaned out, rinse and repeat. That's how there are trillions of dollars that don't exist in people's accounts.

Exactly. There's a reason the 1mb limit was put into place, but most of these noobies wouldn't know that. Big blocks centralize nodes. We don't need another whole segment of Bitcoin decentralization wiped out. Besides that, segwit is effectively an up to 3.7mb block. The 2mb block size argument falls flat on its face. Miners want bigger blocks so they can keep asicboost, tell the masses that's not true, they want big blocks because it's a better way to scale, Core lied, blah, blah, blah, and you fools believed them.

Good luck getting people to scan their retina. I know I'm not going to. There are already ways of verifying identity. All the exchanges do it.

Then you could distribute 1 vote coin per ID via air drop or something. Votes will be sold, but they're sold now, so who gives a fuck.

Precisely why the users are activating segwit on August first. We're making Bitcoin great again.

My jalapeño was digging up nearly BTC .10 last week, now it's about .05/day. The difficulty is skyrocketing due to the asics reaching their owners. It's crazy.

I beg to differ. All my customers use BTC, except one that uses Dwolla.

This kid's going places. Retired young would be my bet. ��

Then they'll be an altcoin. Hey can do that anytime they want to.

All you need is WiFi since you already have a qr code. Duckduckgo.com now shows btc to fiat conversion, so you can offer your btc customers the latest price. Simply type in your price and convert.

This is really cool. I'm sending my friends BTC for Christmas with tweets, lol. This is gonna be huge. Remember what BTC tips on Reddit did for Bitcoin. This is gonna be news too.

Tell us more about how a simple ponzi scheme is going to crash Bitcoin. Sorry, but this is FUD.

Keep up the great work. Heard about Satoshi Forest, excellent things you're doing, Sean. Donation on the way :)
Edit: I'm going to pledge 10% of everything my site grosses to you going forward. You're making a difference and I want to help you do it. Well done!
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:26:02
Sorry Jason, I see your name there now. Just the same, you're doing great things and I'm sure Sean would be damn proud of ya. We need a lot more of you in this world. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:55:33
Works really well. Nice job!
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:35:10
Same here. I'm betting on it :-)

Just bought a Walmart gift card on egifter app with Bitcoin. Worked like a charm. This is great! You can now buy literally ANYTHING with Bitcoin!

Dollar General(they already accept PayPal, so might be open to it), Kroger, Walmart, utilities, time warner. I want to use Bitcoin for everything, lol.

Thanks :-) BTW, .911 BTC donated so far :-D
