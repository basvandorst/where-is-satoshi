Even if you want to make a universal generalization about politicians being bought and sold, how does that imply that they are incompetent and/or stupid? The accuracy of your premises doesn't even matter if your argument is unsound.
Do you ever wonder what it takes for these politicians to be "bought and sold", literally or not? Could you do it? Since you've studied politics you might have some idea about the work and intellect it takes to navigate yourself to such a position. Or maybe you don't, who knows. Hell I might just sign up to the "political buffoon" list, maybe someone will throw money at me until I'm the governor.

So I think legality/illegality is a little irrelevant in this case. NY is placing a hurdle on nascent startups that will give other states more business.

Can you give a concrete example? Who was Mitt Romney sold to? I don't know what website you're being indoctrinated by so you'll have to tell me

Feel free to stop replying, but what makes them incompetent? I think they serve their constituents well, that's what they were bought and sold to do right?

I remember these 1,000 Bitcoin ATM posts

This is nuts, and also gentlemen/actually good news

You could buy some stuff on Newegg, Tiger Direct, etc. I think you can also trade it for amazon gift cards with Purse.io
If I were you I would just buy/pay for things directly with your bitcoin instead of trying to sell directly. It would solve the problems you describe in your original post

Actually most (if not all) of them are extremely intelligent. They know how to prosper in this world, and they know how to gain/keep power. If by corrupt you mean self-serving, I'll concede that they are yes. But so would you given the opportunity, don't kid yourself about that.
If anyone has puppeteers telling them what to think and do...maybe it's the people who gullibly believe that politicians are stupid and incompetent. Sorry

The people with money buy power from politicians*
You think the people selling power are incompetent? I wish I was incompetent then

Why do you think this? I think less prosperous states than New York will welcome the new businesses/jobs/revenue. NY != USA (and thank god for that)

You're walking in and paying with a starbucks giftcard. Yes, you get the giftcard by using Fold, just like you get your cash by working at your job. Is your job a middleman when you use cash at Starbucks?

No you aren't, that's a huge jump in logic. 
And there are 49 other states that Bitcoin companies can fairly compete in.

Just buy back whatever amount you spend

"This is actually good news" is a historic meme here in r/bitcoin, dating back to the winter of 2013 when the price was falling from its November peak. Are you new here? :p

This is actually good news

I recommend this sub for you instead:
