You'll get amazing service and you won't have to deal with merchant directly if anything goes wrong with your order, you just let snapCard know the issue and they'll take care of everything with the merchant for you.

Actually there's evidence that Wall Street is already quietly in the mix. You won't find it in the media but there are several btc funds where private investors are handing over money to fund managers who are backordered on finding avenues to buy bitcoins. It's no different from hedge funds or mutual funds.

Jack here from snapCard. Just fluffing on reddit and saw this. Don't worry if the price amount isn't right- we''ll review it and convert it to USD before invoicing you ;)

Jack here at snapCard. we get customers ordering regular stuff, like grocery on walmart or crafts on etsy. why not just buy what you actually want according to your natural consumer preference? it's just money, albeit a great one.

Jack here at snapCard. Just wanted to clarify that you wouldn't be "wasting away" $75, since you're buying a desired product valued at $75. This is more of a way for us to prevent spam sign-ups for those who try to fill out multiple brackets. We're just trying to do something fun for the community is all ;)
