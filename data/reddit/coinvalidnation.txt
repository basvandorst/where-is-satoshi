We cannot let this issue get treated like so many other issues that deal with privacy in our lives.  We ALL have to act right now, and do everything we possibly can to stop bitcoin becoming another tool for control.
The difference [to typical government based control] is that bitcoin is very community driven, and many of us are active participants in this technology.  We completely have the power to control how this turns out, but we must not be complacent in these [relatively] early stages of bitcoin's development.

If this is real, we might be able to trick it to tip us [back the $0.75 it was tipped earlier].
Dear mtgox, I am having an issue with my username '+all verify' Can you please verify this account?
When does '+roll verify' reply? Please contact '+roll verify' +roll verify about this issue. Can you?
Can you +roll verify?  When will you +roll verify?

I would like a trezor just because it's a nice piece of kit, but I feel that my [main stash of] coins are sufficiently secure in my offline + electrum seed in safe method.  The &lt;2 btc I have in online wallets for casual spending/access is also secure enough via 2FA.  I've used this approach for a long time and never had a single issue.
I'd maybe get one if they brought back the metal version, for a relatively reasonable price of course, say $150.

Protip: Back up the rar file before you do anything with it!

Christ - just saw in your other reply that it might actually be a substantial amount of btc.  You SHOULD be able to crack the RAR file quite easily, which would let you load your wallet and see your public key and show you your actual balance. You only need the encryption key to do a transaction.

If you have a clue to what it is - that's a massive step in reducing the brute force complexity.
I actually did a similar thing to my wallet too...locked myself out and had to brute force it. Luckily I knew pretty much what it was (for some reason I just used an unusual variation of what I expected it to be) and got in! Good luck!
PS. If you've not got skills to do it yourself, there are people that can help you. I remember someone on here from years ago going by something like "Charlies Wallet Recovery" was trustworthy, though of course be careful and research them properly.
I'd be happy to help you, but only if you really don't care about the amount of btc...since you've got no reason to trust me :P.

Good luck...keep us updated OP!

There might be a way to recover it...but we'll need to hope that you didn't use a particularly strong password. I remember winRar passwords being easy to break, regardless of complexity, if I remember correctly (though it's been years so not sure).
Did you use the official Bitcoin Core client? Do you remember writing down a '12 word seed' anywhere? Did you maybe backup an unencrypted copy in dropbox or gmail?
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:09:20
Yup, I'm pretty sure that's the guy I was thinking of too.

Well shit, passphrases can be impossible to hack if truly random. However, if you used a common phrase like in your example, but with some l33t modifications, that's possibly quite easy to crack.

I've got a whole national theme going.

At least in the UK (and I'm guessing it's the same in US and rest of Europe), the exchanges must keep your records for 5 years.  These records include all of your transaction history, as well as the verification documents you supplied that contain all of your personal information, including address, picture, etc.
Apart from anything else, it's a hackers wet dream to gain access to that sort of documentation.  Sure hope our documents are being kept somewhere safe in an offline backup.

Mining is very easy to set up, but pointless at this stage in the game.  Don't waste your time and money on it, just buy bitcoin if you want to get involved.

Better odds than the lottery, I like it!

What exactly happened? The withdrawal address in your BitMinter account was not an address you hold?  How did it get there? What is the address that the coins DID get sent to?  Maybe contact BitMinter support and ask them.
