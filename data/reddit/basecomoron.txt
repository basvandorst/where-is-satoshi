No, it's very realistic. Route hijacking is very easy (the core of the internet is pretty much a "trust everyone and hope nobody presses the red button" sort of deal). It's been used to attack the bitcoin network before and steal money from miners using the insecure stratum protocol. 


You can detect a drop in hashrate to signify you are being left behind. 


No. It can be fed alternate blocks, but only if the attacker is able to mine them at the same hashrate as the rest of the miners in the real network combined. Assuming they can not, you will see the drop in block speed and be made aware that an attack is taking place.

Yes. 
It's a security feature. If this behavior existed you wouldn't be able to tell if you were isolated from the real network or not. Someone could intercept your connection, wait 30 minutes while not paying attention, and then make low difficulty blocks with false contents. A rapid drop in the block rate suggests that you aren't connected to the wider network and you can be proactive in preventing disaster by accepting double spent payments. Idiots like Andreas think that difficulty adjustments are an issue without realizing that it's a core function of keeping the network safe from segmentation.

There's a whole thread of tweets where he argues that the adjustment time is too long, needs to be changed, and in the end Peter Todd replies and explains just why it would be dumb to remove a core security feature for no good reason.

Miners can do whatever the hell they want in that regard. Just the default behavior allows some free transactions and high priority transactions get precedence. Some miners don't do this at all.

To cut down on spam. Young outputs are more likely to be spam.

"Selfish mining" doesn't really have an impact unless you are near a majority anyway, it just allows you to get a seemingly higher effect for your hashpower. Large miners have an incentive not to act like that in order to not negatively affect the price, which they depend on for income.
