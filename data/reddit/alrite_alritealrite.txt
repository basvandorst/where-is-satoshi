You got in during the frenzy..there are adoption pains...yes. The software is evolving every month though. Hope you give it a chance someday when the tech settles. You can see that this person sent a large amount with $1 fee. Even lower fees are possible. Lightning network is coming to Bitcoin later this year.

Mining. 
Bitcoin related, but he probably wants to mine an altcoin, not Bitcoin itself. Even with 100GPU's, you probably would not break even mining Bitcoin (unless free electricity). But altcoin...yes.

It's price discovery phase...once price stabilizes enough, the hodl mentality will decrease.
Also, I am not 100% sure Bitcoin is deflationary (as measured by money supply, not commenting on price). The Bitcoin supply is still increasing. There are over 4 million Bitcoins yet to be produced over the next few decades.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:15:07
Segwit adoption, Segwit adoption, Segwit adoption. Get Andreas on fast money! Unfortunately, the price increase has made BTC UNUSABLE. Until fixed, BTC is a victim of its own success. Considering this price action, the core developers have been proven wrong. Fees have been too high (spamming or not). Taking decentralization too far. You made a bunch of money on BTC, store more data on your computers (bigger block sizes)! Segwit adoption, Segwit Adoption. Go lightening!
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:51:11
I used to think like that a year ago. 
But I have already seen some gains. I spent some of my bitcoin today at the local bookstore and then for food/pizza (using a BTC backed debit card...until they accept crypto). Will keep spending for essentials and more. It's early stages for crypto.
It's not gains I am after....its the efficiency/transparency of the internet (global) that I like....
If Gold were infinitely divisible and easily sent across the world in a jiffy, would fiat still be backed by Gold? Maybe fiat should be backed by BTC...
@_date: 2018-09-24 02:41:17
I totally disagree. Bitcoin has better developers and most new developments start with Bitcoin first. With the lightning network one of the most pressing issues (speed/scaling) can be fixed.

Adding this place to bucket list.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:56:41
Yes, the network is full. Until there is a scaling solution. Also look into ‘replace by fee’ and ‘child pays for parent’ transactions and tx accelerators.

Some people learnt about Bitcoin from CNBC...so they have been helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:34
Same for Gold, but ti still retains value. This is digital (i.e. software), that's all. Can still hold value.
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:04:29
I support both too, but frankly, merely increasing block size from 1MB to something bigger is not the solution I was looking for...it’s a band aid at best. Patience. Hopefully Lightning will strike!

Large transactions will be on chain. At current prices,  channels will be much smaller than 10 BTC (as an average consumer).
You would be doing 10's or 100's of transaction in a few days/weeks/months and then close the channel (whenever you choose).

No good book is going to tell you it’s going up! Most good books will talk about the technology and future use cases. 
I have seen many posts here that said, put in only what you can lose. Of course there were some who were extremely bullish.
If it keeps going down and you have anxiety, sell yours. I will most probably be still holding.
If you really spent months researching it you will know that hashing rate (security) is constantly increasing, new app layers are being developed (lightning network) which will greatly improve scaling etc. 
It’s a bloody OPEN, decentralized protocol running over the internet. Anyone can contribute to it. Every transaction can be fully tracked online. Brilliant. The people’s money.
Hopefully this is the beginning.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:41:05
Looks interesting. Probably should put the name of the app on the front page of the website.
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:20:28
I don’t look at price action anymore. Yes, the 60% drop hurts.
I remember when I first invested. It was ~$1000. It went down to $250 in a few months. I was pissed. However, I held on. If I got a chance I bought more.
The reason I held on? I had researched Bitcoin for weeks (if not months) and was impressed by the revolutionary technology and the future it represented.
@_date: 2018-10-27 02:55:36
Either way, fees end up being about 4% of all payments, which is huge. And 15%-25% interest rate if its credit.
@_date: 2018-10-21 22:06:25
Maybe not a bad idea, if you are young enough to take big risks. Some of the penny stocks are so small cap...any publicity/celebrity endorsement  will increase price, substantially in some case. You just have to get out soon.

I see everyone hating on Coinbase. Is it bc they added BCH? I have used coinbase forever. In fact, it’s the starting point for so many people in crypto. For years! Hate to see all the negative comments.
@_date: 2019-06-10 12:40:10
So you are saying the millionaire can’t procure physical gold from anywhere?
This also presumes Bitcoin is the only crypto currency with value. That is TBD.
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:04:09
Bitcoin debit card. Converted to USD if merchant wants, but you are still spending Bitcoin. With time, merchants might accept Crypto straight. A few already do.
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:15:47
Right. USD and all the fiat currencies have been used for SO many good things. Yes, all of social fabric depends on it.
Crypto has to provide something that is much better than Fiat and keep the social fabric (terrorists etc.) in check. 
Crypto has to get a lot better. Maybe someday. Has to be the right technology though.

And if it’s a co-ordinated ban by all developed countries, BitCoin may be fucked.

Its everything. Stock, gold, currency, commodity, store of value, payment network, open source, decentralized, blockchain and a few other buzz words.
Price against other currencies is just a measure. Price discovery is still going on. Especially until things are priced in BTC (if ever).

But as a percentage of its current use/value....crypto is used more. Right? With less chance of tracking.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:29:04
I didn't read the article, but think of the ticketing system as a spreadsheet, but globally/publicly view able. Also know there are Public and Private key pairs. What gets updated is serial number &lt;-&gt; public key mapping. This public key is analogous to the address they mention.
So the spreadsheet has a serial # of the ticket and Public key (address) of owner of ticket (all visible globally). Whoever has private key (for that public key) owns the ticket. When ticket is sold, new private/public key is generated for buyer and public key is updated in spreadsheet. Private key is provided only to buyer.
Sometimes, if buyer brings their own public/private key, no new private/public keypair needs to be generated.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:42:56
Great job bud
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:06:14
Invested few years back. For the first 1-2 years I didn't sell any. Now more than 50% of my expenses are by spending BTC (via fiat, but that's only bc few merchants accept direct crypto yet). Even though I know there is a good chance it will go up, I am spending it.
My point is...once you make 'enough', you start spending, even as a hodl'er. Each individual has their own saving/expense style. 
OTOH, if the currency is not appreciating (after price discovery), then people will have no trouble spending it.
Also, I don't believe people should spend only on necessary items. The economy will take a big hit.
We are still producing a bunch of BTC for many years to come, so hopefully its enough to sustain economic activity. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:12:08
yes, but if you were born, you want to live, otherwise, whats the point? You want nice clothes, car, travel etc. Which is what you are currently able to do. 
You don't want to sit at home eating ramen noodles conserving your BTC just so it keeps going up.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:19:56
ughh.....loss of jobs. Also, competition and free market is usually good. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 09:52:22
You didn't address the question about percentage.
Also, blockchain at its current state increases privacy. Especially with tor and what not. 
You cannot send hoards of untraceable cash from one continent to another easily for illicit purposes (can be done, but with more difficulty).
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:44:12
Only banks that can create a publicily viewable Proof Of Reserve system (and no fractional banking), maybe....only for insurance/infosec reasons.....otherwise fuck banks we don't need them.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:17:56
Ok, good points....but u can buy illegal goods via cash, credit card, barter etc. too. So u want illegal goods, ransomware, wikileaks to be the killer app? That's 1-3% of the population.
As far as fiat currencies in developing countries, they could adopt Dollars or fix their political issues. Using Bitcoin would be good....but can the uneducated masses really use it and keep their money safe? I am open to it, it's a possibility but still quite slow adoption.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:38:17
But one system incentivizes spending, while the other saving. While you are alive, which one would you rather? If BTC would inflate 1-2% (hell we could vote on amount increase every year) that would be great.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:50:28
I second that!
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:49:12
Prolly because they don't think Bitcoin is ready for prime time yet. The avg consumer can't handle talk of soft fork vs hard fork, public/private key, keep a 12-24 seed phrase safe. That's assuming they use 0 conf like bitpay.  Also with price increase, most ppl want to hodl not spend.
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:16:15
Great Introduction. Enjoyed it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:07:21
From a regular user perspective (99% of the people out there), most of this doesn't matter. They like their cash back, rewards, insurance the card provides. Also, traditional payment systems are much easier to use and safer. 
Most of the initial advantages of crypto are merely fringe benefits. Frankly, the biggest advantage is price keeps going up and more people get interested. We are many many years away from people using crypto. Maybe IOT devices or robots or smart appliances will use it first.
There is no killer app for consumers (yet).
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:42:31
Not never...once computers are fast enough to break/brute-force current bitcoin encryption, which can be many many years away....treasure hunt in the high seas...pirates

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:30:35
Other countries might be tempted to ban its use. Huge price reduction and volatility. People will not use it as a currency/asset, i.e. much slower adoption for the masses.

Tell that to the peoples of Venezuela, some African countries, North Korea and all countries in the next 20 years going to have financial turmoil. Basically all over the world.
Oh yeah, and in the long run I wouldn’t mind blackjack (or roulette) since I know the probability. I can personally manage chips. Even better if the house edge (friction) is really minuscule, which I believe bitcoin can provide.

Fair comments. He is right about everyone making money is weird. But he does say blockchain has lots of value and his issue is with valuation, not value. At least he is open. Good publicity.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:31:49


Maybe, but it's a escape valve when things go wrong for the people. I could leave a country and settle somewhere else and still have access to my funds. Or I could have been trading in BTC instead of currency XYZ that's hyper-inflating.


Curious, what is it? I was hoping Gold, but it also has it's issues.


Some of this is growing pains and price discovery. There is not 1 asset in this world that's truly stable.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:36:24
So there’s going to be 200 centralized currencies forever. What happens when some African country or some island has hyper inflation, mismanagement or civil war? Think of the people. Or you want them all to move to USD?

What if we take humans out of the monetary policy. Let the computers do it...they are good at math anyway. And let them maintain the ledger. They will be unbiased and issue money at a specified rate.
