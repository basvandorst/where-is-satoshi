I'm liking that testnet number.

Not that Ripple is any better...

You guys could create a smart contract to enforce your bet.

I came for the classic pepsi, but I stayed for the crypto.

The caption is not a paradox, as long as you're willing to lose everything.

IRL I'd rather the Tesla. But for the sale of the meme... When Lambo?

Yes, Coinbase (and any other exchange) will have an option to withdraw coins. Input the public key of your hardware wallet, and your coins will be sent to the hardware wallet.
After that your coins will be stored on the hardware wallet, and will be completely inaccessible by anyone unless they both get access to your hardware wallet, and they know your pin.
When you setup the wallet, be sure to store your recovery seed somewhere safe where nobody can get it. Because the recovery seed is the only way to recover your coins if the hardware wallet breaks or you forget your pin.
Do not store the recovery seed on your computer, because that would completely negate the safety of using a hardware wallet. If your computer becomes compromised, they will be able to use that recovery seed to access your wallet.

In order to access your funds, someone would need to both get access to your hardware wallet (ie. Steal it), and know your pin code.
Since you enter the pin code on the hardware wallet, (or in the case of a trezor, enter it into your computer in a scrambled form), a key logger cannot steal your pin. But even if someone somehow got your pin, they would still need the hardware wallet.

SegWit is short for Segregated Witness. It was a change that removed some unnecessary information from transactions, which reduced their size. This meant that more transactions could fit in a block, meaning lower transaction times and fees.
The introduction of SegWit prompted the hard fork that created Bitcoin Cash. Some miners didn't want to implement SegWit, so they instead created a copy of Bitcoin, and increased the block size from 1MB to 8MB.
S2X is short for SegWit 2x. It's the proposed change to increase the block size of Bitcoin from 1MB to 2MB. Some groups are against this change, and will be creating a new fork of Bitcoin.
So in November we may have  
Bitcoin: (2MB block size, SegWit)  
Bitcoin Cash: (8MB block size, no SegWit)  
Some new Bitcoin (1MB block size, SegWit)  
Please correct me if any of this is false. I have not been following as actively recently, so I may be lacking new information.

Do you make one with an ethereum logo? I'm on mobile, and it doesn't let me look up more products from the company.

Is the glass thick / good quality? There are no reviews, so I'm depending on you before I order one, OP.
Edit: given that the picture you posted is the one from the ad, I'm now realizing you probably don't have one :(

There should be a SPEDN pin too.

You didn't write the punchline...

That looks sweet. I'm interested.
Do you accept crypto (Specifically Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum)? If so, dm me details. Otherwise I'll have to buy it through amazon in a month or so when I have more fiat.
