The share difficulty would still be way too high, especially when you factor in orphaned shares.
I actually had a similar idea for how the issue could be fixed; the p2pool node would connect into different independent sharechains depending on the hashing power behind each chain, so that the miner is always mining on a sharechain with a suitable share difficulty.

The script used to display the node and price information is written in Python. It also has the ScreenContext class I'm using to actually display everything on the screen:
The price ticker is pretty simple; it fetches the price information from Bitstamp every 5 minutes.
For the Bitcoin node information to show up you need to edit your Bitcoin node's configuration to accept JSON-RPC commands and also set an username and a password. There's more information on that here:
After that is done and you've restarted the node, edit the config.py file that came with SHOWtime to have the same JSON-RPC credentials and the script should be able to get all necessary information using JSON-RPC.

According to Blockchain.info, the blockchain has grown about 13 GB during the last 12 months and the total size is currently about 26 GB in size without any kind of pruning. 500 GB should last you for a good while, and even if the amount of transactions increases tenfold, you should (hopefully) be able to prune the blockchain by the time that becomes a problem.
I'm also using the computer for other things besides Bitcoin, such as taking backups and other relatively storage-heavy tasks, so that also explains why I'm using a 1 TB hard drive.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:10:42
Both Raspberry Pi and a lot of other ARM-based Linux computers run Linux, often some variant of Debian, so the process of getting the Bitcoin node to run should be pretty much the same.
The display (ODROID-SHOW) on the other hand is connected using the USB port, so it should work on any computer, although it can't be stacked on top of the computer unless it's a ODROID-U3 or a ODROID-C1. It's also written specifically for that hardware, so plugging in just any display wouldn't work.

Not planning on selling these, since it was just a hobby project. I can tell what devices I used, in case you have the patience and/or the experience to set one up yourself.
The computer I'm using (ODROID-U3) costs $65, although you can opt for a cheaper ODROID-C1 instead, which costs $35. The 1 TB USB external hard drive I'm using costs about $65 on Newegg (again, you can opt for something cheaper, such as a 500 GB HDD) and the display (ODROID-SHOW) is $25.

Bittiraha has [an ATM]( that looks like this one and it works like this:
1. You scan a QR code of your Bitcoin address by holding up the QR code in front of the scanner (which is on the bottom right)
2. You insert the preferred amount of bills into the machine.
3. When you are done, you press Send and the bitcoins are sent to the Bitcoin address that was scanned by the ATM.
I've tried the ATM in Helsinki myself and it worked like a charm. :)

@_date: 2014-12-27 16:44:39
You certainly need something more powerful than an Arduino Uno if you are planning on running a Bitcoin node. :)
However, it should suffice just fine for a simple Bitcoin price ticker or other data that can be fetched from Blockchain.info or other web service.
I use a ODROID-U3 which has 2 GB of RAM and four 1.7 GHz cores, although I've also heard that people are running full nodes on Raspberry Pi(e)s as well, although it's pretty underpowered and doesn't have a lot of RAM. The company behind ODROID-U3 also started selling a lower tier computer that has 1 GB of RAM and a 1.5 GHz quadcore CPU for $35, so that could be a good choice as well.

As far as I know, Bitcoin node does verify everything. Verifying merkel trees is one part of it, but the node also verifies that the transactions are valid, as in they don't spend outputs that didn't exist at the time and the signatures and scripts are valid, which is by far the most expensive operation when syncing a node.
There is a startup parameter that allows certain checks to be skipped when syncing a node, but since the main benefit of running a full node is knowing that the entire blockchain is valid since it has been verified single-handedly, cutting corners would cause problems if you end up with an invalid copy of the blockchain.
The Bitcoin node on the other hand uses about 5-10% of CPU time on each core most of the time, only spiking up to 100% for a few seconds when it receives and verifies a new block. So it isn't a CPU issue.

The problem with p2pool at the moment (may have actually been fixed since I last used it), is that you mine shares, and the difficulty for those shares rises or decreases proportionally based on how much hashing power p2pool has, kind of like how mining and difficulty works with Bitcoin itself.
The problem is, if everyone moved to p2pool the difficulty for mining a single share would skyrocket and p2pool would essentially become a form of solo mining that's a bit easier than normal solo mining. You could compare this to solo mining bitcoins during Bitcoin's first days compared to solo mining now.

Your wallet is a collection of "keys". Public keys, most commonly known as Bitcoin addresses, allow people to verify that transactions have not been forged and are valid, but not create valid transactions. Private keys, on other hand are used to create transactions, although a typical Bitcoin user never sees them.
Private key can't be created from a public key, since they are public and visible in the blockchain, but a public key can be created from the corresponding private key.
When you mine a valid block (containing 50 bitcoins at the moment), you attach a public key, in other words, your Bitcoin address into it, giving you access to the said bitcoins, although you can only spend them if you have the correct private key.
@_date: 2012-04-30 16:26:27
I think there was an utility in Blockchain.info to create a working Bitcoin wallet with the keys you have in your Blockchain.info wallet, but that doesn't seem possible now that the site is down. In the meantime, you could add the private keys to an empty Bitcoin wallet with importprivkey RPC-command and then rescanning the wallet to see the funds.
Unless you really need to use the coins at the instant, you should just wait until Blockchain.info comes back online.

I created the site [BitCrate]( and ran it for about two and a half months. I closed it down and sold it, because I wanted to move into other projects. It should be relaunched soon by the new owner, if any of you miss it. :)
* Referral program is a pretty good incentive to get users to the site. Basically, if an user is brought to the site by a referral link created by someone, the referring person will get a small portion of the referred user's payouts after he/she has used the referral link to get a payout.
* I handled the payments manually. I've done it because the site tends to get a lot of fraudulent entries, which I removed manually. The payments are then processed on my own PC instead of a remote Bitcoin daemon. It's possible you could code something to pick out the fraudulent entries, but I found it easier to do it manually. It depends on how much traffic your site gets, since it wouldn't be much fun to wade through thousands of entries.
* The payouts from Bitcoin advertising services tend to fluctuate a lot. [Anonymous Ads]( barely made me any bitcents when I started using it, but coincidentally, I started earning a lot more after I closed the site and most of the visitors disappeared.
* There's also [Bitcoin Advertising]( which actually made me a lot of bitcoins in the end, but the site owner has denied many partners from getting payouts for apparently no reason at all, so I wouldn't trust them completely. I also used [Operation Fabulous]( which sometimes would pay me 0.50 BTC per day and sometimes 0.05 BTC per day. In retrospect I could have done better by using the old and boring advertising methods such as Google AdSense. :P
* You could pay users a flat amount of bitcoins, but it would be probably more interesting to randomize the payouts a bit, so the user has a chance to get a bigger prize every once in a while. In BitCrate the user could choose which crate to break in order to get a chance at winning a better payout.

Recently, I had my bitcoin node crash frequently. Turns out the mempool was filling out faster than the transactions were included in blocks, resulting in the machine eventually running out of RAM. With the newest version you can adjust the maximum size of the mempool (-maxmempoolsize, where the value is the maximum size in megabytes), which helped fix the regular crashing.
I can't say this for sure, but the drop in amount of active nodes could have something to do with the nodes running on inexpensive hardware like Raspberry Pi's running out of RAM and then crashing. And unless you specifically check that the node is running, you wouldn't probably even notice the node crashed.
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:48:08
I only run the node for the sake of contributing to the Bitcoin network. Electrum works better as a wallet in my opinion, since the 12-word seed (and thus the wallet) can be backed up far more easily, and it just feels more usable than Bitcoin Core. The transactions are signed locally, so aside from the server withholding or hiding outgoing and incoming transactions, there's not much of a risk for using Electrum instead of a full node. And even then, you can just shuffle between multiple Electrum servers instead of trusting just one.
@_date: 2011-09-11 19:44:02
If it's HTML5 and Javascript why do I need Google Chrome to run it?
That's the big point users care about, not whether it's technically capable of running on HTML5 compatible devices and applications. Especially since it's targetting casual, non-techy people. I'll assume this will be changed in the future.
That, and with web apps you have more points where you can have a security breach (add Flash exploits and malicious Javascript alongside the OS security holes) which kind of ruins the point of calling it safer than a native client. I may be mistaken if the application is sand-boxed.
I did try it out and the smooth user interface did look and feel nice. I'd like to use it but for now I'll just watch how it goes.
I DON'T hate your application, I just find having to install yet another web browser an unnecessary hurdle.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:07:22
Electrum requires that you repeat the seed for the wallet you are creating before you are allowed to use it. That, and when it asks you for the seed you can't just hit Back to check the seed again (the program assumes you actually did copy the seed when it was displayed to you, otherwise you have to create a new wallet), so you would have to deliberately disregard the program's advice about storing the seed.
Can't say I feel bad for the user who lost his bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-09-11 19:03:19
The fact you have to install something before running it kind of ruins the point of the program being cross-platform. I'll try it again once I won't need to install Google Chrome just to run a single application.
That, and it won't matter how secure your application is, if the web browser or virtual machine (eg. JVM) itself is compromised it won't mean anything.
@_date: 2015-11-23 18:23:13
I'm aware of those limitations. If I were to broadcast any transactions I wouldn't want others keeping track of, I wouldn't be broadcasting them with my public IP (using Bitcoin Core or not) in the first place.
From what I've read, Electrum server takes over a week to sync up and even if I were to download an indexed database rather than doing the indexing myself, the ODROID-XU4 I'm running the server on would probably start running out of RAM when both the Bitcoin client and Electrum server are running on it. I'll probably look into it if and when I have more capable hardware available.

My point is that the IP address displayed at Blockchain.info, or pretty much elsewhere is at best only an educated guess.
For example, a bunch of transactions filed under my IP address weren't actually sent by me, Blockchain.info simply came into that conclusion because those transactions were broadcasted into one of their Bitcoin nodes first by my computer. It's also why Blockchain.info uses the "transactions relayed first by" label instead of "transactions sent by" label for those transactions.
I'm not saying you can't get the IP address, it's just that you have no way of knowing whether the IP address was actually behind the transaction or not.
Other points I agree with. Bitcoins are not inherently anonymous, but taking certain precautions can make most Bitcoin users anonymous. The common fallacy is that Bitcoin is an anonymous currency and that using it will automatically make one untrackable. That is not the case.

In my case it took weeks before they reported back after I first requested them to withdraw my funds to a bank account. The bank transfer failed because they hadn't moved to SEPA (and they still haven't), which meant I had to randomly try withdrawing with differently formatted bank account numbers instead of just typing in my IBAN and BIC. 
After three tries, over a month of waiting and some "failed bank transfer" fees later it finally worked out and they sent the money as they were supposed to.

Normal household computers with GPUs can try tens of millions of different password combinations PER SECOND. It doesn't matter if your last name is common or not, but your password, if it consists of your last name and some numbers, could be cracked either way, especially since most bruteforcers use dictionary attacks, where the program tries combination of dictionary words with various symbols (eg. numbers added to the end of one or two words).
Passwords such as 'michael52' and 'loneRANGER535' are very easy to crack.
You could read this article to see how easy password cracking is and why having a strong password matters:
Also, remember to enable two-factor authentication! This way you are required to input a code that's sent to/generated on your mobile phone before you are able to use your wallet. It's a life saver if your computer is compromised and/or your password gets stolen.
However, if you are storing a large amount of bitcoins, I recommend using an offline wallet. Electrum and Armory are Bitcoin wallets which support offline wallets.

Calling Bitcoin clients that need to download the blockchain "offline wallets" seems incorrect. Maybe it would be better to classify Bitcoin clients as lite or full clients instead of offline and online clients?

* You can start sending and receiving bitcoins immediately, since you don't have to download the entire blockchain.

The only way you can find out the IP address behind a certain transaction is to find the first Bitcoin node that broadcasted the transaction and even then, you can't be sure whether it was the original user or just a proxy. It's possible to run a Bitcoin client that only connects to predefined Bitcoin clients by modifying Bitcoin-qt's configuration file.
Then there are web wallets and lite clients which don't broadcast the transaction directly into the Bitcoin network and instead use a Bitcoin server as a proxy (eg. Blockchain.info, Electrum and Strongcoin). In that case you would only see the IP address of the Bitcoin server, not the user  that created the transaction. 
Add proxies and anonymization networks such as Tor and I2P to the mix and tracking the originating transactor will be even harder.

I don't know about you, but using Awesome Face as the logo/avatar doesn't exactly inspire confidence in this project.

Says someone who has been reverting SatoshiDICE, Litecoin and  Talk:Tonal Bitcoin pages while calling one's own edits either "original research" or "troll removal" while sparing content that fits your own agenda.
It wouldn't be bad if you would at least provide your edits with some proof, but when you refuse to work with people (eg. checking the talk page to see what people think or giving your own input on other people's contributions without resorting to the 'revert' button), that's when I have a problem.
I can understand that you are only trying to make Bitcoin as a whole more successful, but your behavior is not helping anyone.

The e-mail message came from an e-mail address under the  domain, which seems to be e.ventures' name before it merged with other capital fund companies.
I sent both the sender and the e.ventures's contact e-mail address a message asking for verification and I have only received a reply from the former. He told me he found my site because the site had been growing a lot in terms of traffic:
I told the person who contacted me I was planning on keeping my site a hobby project for now. Since it's weekend right now, I won't probably receive another reply until Monday. Either way, it surprised me that the site is getting so much traffic that people are contacting me about it. Makes me wonder whether I've monetized the site well enough.

That's the same impression I got too.
I was trying to edit the Bitcoin Wiki article on SatoshiDice to be more neutral, but Luke-Jr kept reverting my edits and eventually told me he would only allow me edits to stay if I specifically told in the article that SatoshiDice is a DDoS attack. That and some other edit wars ( [1]( [2]( [3]( ) he has been participating in discouraged me from contributing to the wiki.

From what I've gathered they are also doing a terrible job of doing anything about bug reports. I submitted this issue to their Github repository 24 days ago but they have yet to respond to it in any way:

Depends on the type of wallet you use.
Bitcoin-Qt, which is the official reference client, has a default key pool of 100, which means you need to backup it after 100 addresses have been created (addresses are created when sending transactions or when creating a new address manually)
On the other hand, Blockchain.info's web wallet and Electrum (which I recommend) use deterministic seeds to generate your Bitcoin addresses, which means you only need to memorize the seed, which is represented as a list of 12 words. That means you only need to store those 12 words in the correct order somewhere and you can restore your entire wallet in case the file gets corrupted.

For future reference, [don't hold the camera that way.](
With that out of the way, I hope the formal video presentation will clear things up.

If you are developing a web application that handles bitcoins in some way and you want to use a Bitcoin daemon (in which case you are not trusting a wallet provider like Blockchain.info or Coinbase and instead you handle a Bitcoin wallet yourself), you'll have to interface with the Bitcoin daemon using the JSON-RPC API. 
This library simplifies that process.
