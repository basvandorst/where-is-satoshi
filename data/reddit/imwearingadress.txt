You're mistaken the pass of time with the acquisition of knowledge. I'm sure some folks got in December and made more money than you and i and left before the crash. If you really been here for so long, then why are you still here? Who is the dummy?

Really? Why should an asset that only serves the purpose of transfering funds around should cost this much? Because you want it to cost this much? And i'm the dumb guy right?

Is the second time you ask me to explain what i said. I'm starting to think that maybe you are not the one i should be addressing my thoughts. Reading comprehension is essential for me to continue this conversation.

Demand is not high enough for that factor to be taking into account right now.

I was here when bitcoin was a hair under 3k and the market was behaving normally. The price right now is being artificially created by people who are eager to sell it to you as soon as it rises a little bit.

This is not FUD. Bitcoin must fall. The global market cap is close to what it was mid 2017, and BTC was barely 3k. The actual price of BTC is not natural right now, and the only people supporting it now are the same people who are dumping it on you when you think its "recovering". The market will be back to what it was ONLY if BTC goes down.

The main theme on your post was about how long have you been in crypto. The first sentence of my response lets you see how irrelevant that is. Stay in denial as long as you want, reality will take care of that for you.

Its serves a purpose, thats gives it value. Now, how valuable should it be is another question. Is there any reason for it to be worth what is worth now? Or even more? Why? Cause you desire it? Meanwhile let people capitalize on your denial.
