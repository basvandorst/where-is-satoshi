Also technically it would be my account. I don't think they could take something from that 
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:42:50
Thanks, good suggestion 
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:52:03
Priority right now is putting it somewhere where it doesn't disappear over night. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:41:18
Thanks a lot for your answer!
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:12:11
We will probably do that, thanks
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:45:16
Yeah sure, it's not like he worked hard paid all his taxes and bought huge German machines for his work. The crisis is the fault of many things but definitely not of some guy with a small business. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:01:44
He does already have a pretty big collection of silver jewelry. I don't really know how much it's worth though. I'll call him in a bit 
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:06:55
Yeah but that's too 'if' for him probably. I will talk to him about buying a little bitcoin but we'll probably send most of his money to Germany. Last year I myself bought stuff for thousands of euros from my 250€ btc purchase but I know no one can count on that to happen again 
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:12:32
thanks for the input 
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:54:43
I haven't even considered that. It's better than having it with a greek bank right?
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:47:08
That's a cool site. We'll look at that, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:47:26
Right. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:37:18
Thank you very much for this comment. I deleted the thread because I think that at this point all of the possible suggestions have been made and it got a little overwhelming! We have a few transfers queued up now, I really hope they'll go through on Monday. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:53:47
Yep that sounds like a good idea. Due to tourism pretty much everything accepts MasterCard and Visa over there. I was thinking that the people would stop accepting credit cards though once they no longer have enough cash and can't get any themselves from the banks, but I think at this point dad should have probably already moved to Germany, haha
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:11:50
1 Yes I do, nothing wrong with that unless I blindly trust anyone 
2 No. You assume too much. This is about his last savings and what's left on his account. As mentioned earlier he invested into silver years ago, partly due to the dawning crisis. He also has some beautiful land and together with his family owns and runs a rather big carpentry company. It's not like this is about all of his money which is now stuck on his bank account. But all money is money and it would suck if even a little of it got lost to some bullshit bank dying. 
Thanks for the suggestion though, we're working on that now.   
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:52:29
Sure, thanks. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:02:56
I will talk him about it in a bit, thanks a lot 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:42:11
There might still be hope. But even if not - it sucks, but most of his money has already been off the bank. He would lose some of it, most probably, unless his transactions do go through at some point. But we are very lucky all things considered. If shit really hits the fan he would just move to Germany, and since the German side of my family is quite economically stable... Well, let's just say there are others in much more trouble. 
I was very upset yesterday but since then I've realized how much luck we're having. Even if the money is gone. 
Now the next thing is figuring out a way to sell his silver. When it's time for that, it will probably be hard to do. I'm thinking Bitcoin could come in handy then. It'll probably be better/easier/quicker to send and trade it off the banks. And if we do need to move some money out of Greece we can use BTC to get past capital control. It's brilliant really. 
Anyway, let's see what next week brings. Thanks for the thoughts though.
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:11:58
Thanks for the suggestion, I think we'll transfer everything here first and then think what to do next. If we got that going before capital control starts at least we have the money saved
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:09:05
Cool, thanks! If we set up a whole bank account here for him, could we send a credit card to him with the post? Sorry if this is stupid 
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:14:07
How would that be a violation of privacy for anyone?
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:46:27
I'm a German citizen, born here and only lived in Greece for a few years (without having Greek citizenship ever) so I think that would be cool. Thanks for the warning though!
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:33:47
Thank you, I use gyft actually, but I'm from Germany, and they don't sell them for amazon.de yet. However, I actually asked them if they will in the future, and the support guy told me that they will expand to Europe sometime this year and offer all kinds of German gift cards.

Terrible story, I feel very bad for the guy. Imagine to have that happen to you. Also shame on any of the "journalists" who were part of publishing that story.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:34:17
For small transfers 0 confirmation with a short delay is ok most of the time, and a much tinier risk than credit card chargebacks. The fee is tiny, you can pay a few cents of fees to move around billions of dollars.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:44:06
I just wrote another mail and bluffed with a lawyer. They simply sent back a screenshot of the order, with an estimated delivery on the 14th of January.
So they lied about ordering it already, but I'm happy that I will most likely receive my packet soon. Really, really shady company.
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:59:25
The whole security layer can apparently be disabled by the ATM owner if they wish to. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:45:49
That would be hilarious in a way. That's the most incompetent way to loose millions of dollars, haha.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:55:01
What if the max limit is reached? Wouldn't we see a huge decline in miners if the transaction fees are so tiny?
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:56:35
I'm pretty amazed for that actually. When we finally get a service that allows purchasing of BTC with credit card like Coinbase, BTCs will become much much more accessible for Europe, and together with something like gyft that's a great thing for users and for bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:32:22
That's because the BTC value dropped pretty sharply yesterday and they are using some kind of average. It's not always like this.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:14:29
Sorry, but I found this extremely confusing.

Not him, but Google Play Music's web app is pretty great, the only thing it doesn't do is gapless playback.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:06:37
Unless they lost the keys, it's pretty much confirmed. If someone really stole those bitcoins by aquiring the private key, and didn't move them, that would mean that the thief believes that MtGox doesn't have ANY copy of the private keys, and that would be extremely stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:15:35
It's still just a joke, and can pretty obviously not be treated as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:26:31
Haha oh god. Where is that from?
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:13:13
This is why I switched to Android, pretty much. I've been using iOS for years, but I decided to get a new android phone. And what can I say? I've never heard "nah, you can't do that" so far. And I have a sticker next to my front door that, when touched with my phone, activates the home profile and automatically powers on my upstairs PC via Wake On Lan. It's perfect if you're a tinkerer, and that's why I think most users of Bitcoin (as of now) should not use iOS.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:42:40
I just sent them an email in which I bluffed with a lawyer. Guess what. They ordered it, and replied 2 hours later with a simple screenshot of the Amazon order, stating that it would arrive on the 14th of January. 
This means 
1. They lied about ordering the item and lied about the shipment date
2. They are afraid of lawyers and actually move their asses once you get angry.
If you still are in that situation, I advise you to do the same, no matter the price of the items.
Good luck.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:50:59
Why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:05:27
You can write whatever you want onto it, and you could launch a Tasker task with it. That way you could do literally everything on your phone. It's a normal NFC tag, so you can have contact data on it, a website link, cryptographic data for unlocking doors, security systems, hotel doors... AFAIK it has two sides, one for sensitive data and one for sharing things like contacts.
By default I think it can unlock your phone with a special app, and you can have contact stuff on it. They have a few examples on their site.
The coolest thing I can think of is when you're in a hotel using NFC chipcards, you can just copy the chipcard content onto that ring and unlock the door with the ring.
*Edit*: Just saw I missed your question about BTC. I think yes. It probably would work by saving a bitcoin:// link on it, which would then launch whatever wallet app executes these links with the data pre entered.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:57:07
I appreciate your response, but I think I should have gotten it personally from you when this wasn't public. I'm not sure if I'll use your service again, but I might give it another try.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:22:16
Jobs was an asshole, but he was damn good at what he was doing. I used to follow Apple a lot, and the way he did presentations was mind- blowing. The products he thought off are just what the people needed - I think apple replacing the crappy touchscreens with capacitive ones in that time already gave the industry a huge push forward.
Apple computers are a masterpiece of engineering, you can't say anything else if you've ever opened a MacBook. Their software is intuitive and looks brilliant, but is also very dumbed down at places.
That's why I would never use an iPhone. I feel like an Idiot using them. The only thing you read in the App Store is 'apps can't do that!', yet Google play has root tools in its own shelves. Apple is never willing to accept anything by others, they will make their own thing which they try to make better, and that's what I don't like about them.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:33:08

Arnhem is like the goddamn BTC capital. Seriously. So many stores accepting Bitcoin - you can actually walk through the streets and look for the symbol on doors, instead of using something like Coinmap. I went there a while ago, and it was glorious - best thing is the ATM at Rose's Lounge.

I did it too, without any android experience whatsoever. However, I found the LG version of android pretty bad, especially the caller app looked like something from 1980. The automated installer of CM doesn't work with the G2, so I grabbed the latest stable version and installing it was quite easy. However I did have some problems along the way which required some tinkering and wiping of the phone etc... the process wasn't nice, but it's SO worth it.

My first and last business with you was extremely terrible. I ordered a single item, and it took over a month, despite you telling me it had been shipped just 3 days after I ordered. I wrote 4 emails asking for a status, which all got ignored, and then threatened with a lawyer, which is when I finally got a response - a simple screenshot of Amazon's shipping confirmation.
Based on my experience I would strongly advice against ordering from these guys, especially because they apparently ship internationally, and I am living in the same country as they are, yet still had a ton of problems and waited months.

The card appears to monitor fluctuations in the BTC price and big transactions from and to your account. The description is "Be notified of fluctuations in Bitcoin value". Sounds like a very interesting first step, and I'm looking forward to more things happening with Bitcoin and Google.

I'm half Greek/half German, living in Germany. The Greek side of my family were openly against the former government from the very beginning - it was obvious they were promising and giving without base, and the Greek economy was never the strongest. 
The family can barely keep up these days. Luckily we own a decent family business which still kind of works. They have a pretty big and high quality carpentering factory set up on a small island. The problem is that less people buy new furniture these days, and at the same time, food, especially milk products, are becoming ridiculously expensive. However, they're in a relatively good situation because even if everything fails, we own quite a chunk of land which *could* be sold in the future.
An interesting thing I realized is that there really isn't any hate towards Germans. I often bring German friends along. It's absolutely NO problem to talk German in Athens, no matter where you are. If anything some people told me they were grateful for us coming there, with tourism declining and all.  
The "hateful" side is Germany tbh. I can't even begin to count the amount of bullshit I've heard about Greece or the European economy in general here in Germany. Just *so much bullshit.* I had to completely shut down popular media for myself during the whole "middle finger" shitstorm. It's unbearable, even if you're only indirectly suffering from the whole situation. But if you know a tiny bit about economy and are personally affected by all of the stuff people like to laugh and make jokes about, it gets a little hard not to get angry.
Sorry if this isn't interesting, just wanted to write a little
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:23:38
Please don't confuse "the Greeks" with the government here. The people calling Germans Nazis are a tiny minority.

I will take a look on the weekend, thanks for the suggestion. I do not believe it'll change my mind though. I have not come across a single good argument contra GMO ever since I started caring about the subject a few years ago. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:21:44
Well austerity doesn't work in a recession. It's bs for a government to save money if there are no taxes in the first place. There needs to be more public spending which would rebuild a healthy government tax income. Saving and austerity would only make the situation worse. 
What needs to happen is a simple debt cut, just as Germany got one after the war. There is no other viable solution. "Grexit" would mean a completely fucked up Greek public and ultimately more HUGE losses for everyone, including Germany. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:55:48
I love this expect for the non GMO part. I fully support GMO and I would expect that further optimization could be achieved with it.

There are lots of app stores for android, but only a few usable ones. F-Droid is a repository for open source software, Amazon has their own app store for android with a lot of the apps the Play Store also sells. On iOS there's Cydia, although only for jailbroken devices. Apple does not allow third party app stores as part of their ecosystem.

You're right, when I checked the values were identical. Hmmh. I don't really see what it could be. If no one answers here I will try to ask my economics teacher tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:56:51
Yup, basically, doing that is only a good idea in case of a bubble - when you know the price is going to stay less than what you sold for for at least the time the transfer takes.

Bitcoin succeeding is unlikely? Until now I heard many people saying that it succeeding is much more likely than it failing. Why do you think it won't get much more widely used?

Doesn't Apple decide if they want it on their store prior to allowing it?

You're right, I'm stupid. The grey arrow isn't even the same on different exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:44:26
I see what they were going for. If you've got a client that downloads lots of blocks, it could potentially be slowed down. But that's completely irrelevant because I'm using Electrum and the transaction isn't listed on blockchain.info.
Edit.: IT JUST CAME THROUGH. After 28 hours. Anyway, I'm happy now.
@_date: 2013-09-05 21:04:29
I see.
Reading about keeping Bitcoins safe got me thinking - do you personally think I should keep them at home or trust some wallet holding service (Coinbase)?
I would be able to create an encrypted partition on an external HDD and store my BTCs there, right?
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:49:19
So what's the difference? People will loose their wallet files, and eventually, theoretically, no one will have access to any bitcoins anymore.
@_date: 2013-10-19 23:47:10
I emailed their support, I must say they responded pretty fast, but all they said was "it can take up to 24 hours depending on your internet connection, bla bla bla". It's been much more than 24 hours now.

I'm not sure, but it seems to be the current price.

Ultimately, people would just adapt to bitcoin in reallife, and you'd never have to exchange to other currencies. That's pretty much not going to happen IMO, though.

Wow, thank you a lot for this great answer. I will continue to invest small amounts of money into the system and see where it gets, without risking too much. I am definitely glad I learned about this whole thing, it makes me excited for the future.

@_date: 2013-11-24 22:00:51
I think I might have figured it out. Could it be the arithmetic average of all the exchanges listed on there? I quickly calculated it and it seems to be it.
@_date: 2013-10-20 22:14:22
I got the coins after 29 hours, finally. Well, I'm happy now, but it's not the best. At least you get the value you are shown when you initiate the withdrawal.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:35:15

I'm already verified, and yeah, I don't plan to withdraw any currency other than BT. Thank you for the help!
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:35:15
All right, I was expecting this. It was just a thought experiment, I was not going to really do it!
But what would you do? Is it more likely to crash horribly or to actually take over and raise in price? If it really gets more and more accepted, using my basic school economy skills, I think it would steadily raise in value, no? Just because the supply is limited and getting more and more limited in the future. Not many people are able and want to mine, right? So, essentially, the ratio of people mining vs. people spending and buying BTCs is getting higher, which means the value will raise.
I think I will continue to invest only a little money at first monthly, and see how it goes.
Thank you for your help!
