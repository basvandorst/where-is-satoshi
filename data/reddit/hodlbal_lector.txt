Awesome. I have a deep distrust for Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:31:37
Wow. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:36:49
Its not gonna go up just yet. Another week or two imo.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:41:28
This is amazing. I wonder how many nodes will be available in the next year.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:49:48
THis is brilliant
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:35:13
Yup. I'm not freaking out. This is all healthy. Reminder we were up over 1000% last year.

Hexabot...lost my btc i bought at 7000...
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:10:07
You also have to understand that there are a ton of competing cryptocurrencys out there rn. Some are easier to spend than others. 
Also I don't think "everyone" is buying it. Try a small example. Ask every single person that serves you food or drinks in the next week if they have invested in Bitcoins. I doubt half have even considered it. Once big business like Amazon starts accepting BTC, it'll become common place and people will buy coffeemakers with Satoshi.

Once again then, you're comparing two things that have nothing to do with each other. Bitcoin hype is different from beanie babies. There are real world appliances to blocm chain tech.

Miners always make more money selling immediately. Ask McAfee
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:41:13
This. Every fucking wannabe nerd that still plays single player RPGs on consoles and watches Rick and Morty will be looking to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:59:41
I think you should determine what you want to buy with cash in the next year. A PS4? A downpayment for a car? Subtract that from what you have and put the rest into BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:28:45
You are incredibly privileged and have a great head start in life. Invest this money into BTC and you probably won't be sorry. Also traditional financial advisors HAVE to say that it isn't smart investing in.

Good sign for hodlers when 1k drop is nothing 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:34:22
goddamn what an investment

You forget that some people expect the satoshi to replace the cent in the next 10 years.

There was a great post on here about personal moons. You will know once you reach your moon.

Dude stop. Wrong place to ask for free money.

Cmon soulslammer dont slam that soul
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:07:31
I just don't see it to be honest. Let's say you're right and there is a big crash. With hundreds of millions of new dollars coming in next year, I doubt it'll cause an absolute collapse. Big business is hungry to adopt in 2018. Also let's say people are as crazy as you say, at this point I think more people are looking to buy at dips.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:32
On the west, and I feel it. I've been losing sleep ever since it hit 8k. So much new FUD. 
But to the moon to you brother. Hope to see you smiling in your millions.

You're comparing Beanie Babies to cryptocurrency. I don't see the logic here.

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:19:04
Once the giant corporation start looking to dip their hands in the money, it'll start to get normalized. People want stability more than a gamble. The future is people using BTC as an everyday currency or as gold. People in a BTC normalized society will not be looking to get rich of BTC, the barrier of entry will be too great.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:06:29
what kind of sketchy...
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:27:56
It can go both ways. The reason its living in cold storage is because there isnt a  easy way to move or use it. Once it becomes mainstream people will innovate constantly bringing new technology. The reason why people are HODLing now is because they expect the currency to be mainstream in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:05
Thank's mum!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:17:16
You're missing the entire point of peer to peer currency. Hodlers don't think in terms of dollar value anymore. They're looking for the day fiat currency will inflate to 0. Also investing $100 and getting back 10k doesn't sound bad at all.
Also 1 million BTC isn't too far off into the future. Give it 10ish years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:44:50
Right but you're one person. Studies all across America done by people all over the globe. The school system is focused on business, not education. Teachers, being part of the system, have been shown to fall into mediocrity year after year.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:59:26
I would ask:
Do you own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:49
I'm not a real estate agent but I'm also planning on buying a piece of property to rent out and diversify my portfolio.

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:01:49
Just invest. No one here can tell you anything if you don't believe in the tech. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:01:34
Well own as in have so much currency that it won't matter how much bitcoin anyone else has. He also believes that they're manipulating us to make them rich. I know it's a really bizarre conspiracy theory, I can't make much sense of it either. 
What I do know is that his entire friend group has either heard of or invested in Ethereum or BTC. He can also explain   the process of removing a third party/banks from our currency. 
My people confuse me quite often.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:58:24
Come on man...
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:56:22
probably 1000
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:53:55
Once again, the case in your state. I don't think you understand what anecdotal means. Every single piece of evidence you have stated is your personal experience. 
And yes these claims aren't mine, they come from people that actually study education. I just choose to believe them.
Also calm down lmao. Just because you like defending teachers on the internet doesn't mean you know absolutely everything lol.
In addition: you're placing a teacher's entire worth on a couple of standardized tests and length of study. I know plenty of brilliant teachers who haven't earned a degree. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:57:40
My experience was actually incredibly unique. I'm Korean and my parents are immigrants who are pretty much in or around K-Town 24/7. From my dad I learned that the community has way more knowledge than the average American. He could explain to me what block chain was and how it worked. You have to remember that they had debit card chips and Samsung Pay for half a decade before it was introduced to the US. They are ready to adopt.
They also believe that the Chinese own Bitcoin. He also believes that its still a bubble. Very confusing.
I managed to secure a 1k loan to invest though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:57:39
dude just buy them back at this point it doesnt even matter
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:44:25
Hey how do we access these funds from the forks? Still very confused how I can access my Bcash and Bitcoin Diamond.

I just graduated from university myself and I am in a similar position to you. As soon as I graduated I bought myself a Prius and a High End PC for OW. The rest of what I had saved went into BTC. Luckily my wife's grandparent's left her with a little money for a downpayment so I have what I have to play around with :D
Good luck man! Hopefully in 10 years we'll both be cryptomillionaire's and retire when were 35!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:59:21
Why this sudden increase in FUD
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:34:55
Except people recognize the term bitcoin.

fucking brilliant
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:44:45
Haha Congrats you have the balls (ball?) to actually come back and face your words. I'm actually impressed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:13:01
Not 95% i was being facetious but the fact of the matter is that a large portion of American teachers are unqualified and the number is increasing each year. Ingersoll's 1999 study was my initial reference but there are ALOT of studies done on how shitty the American education system is.

I look at posts from 2012-2015
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:04:45
No that's what I would ask haha. On Black Friday I asked every Geek Squad and Best Buy techies I could if they owned Bitcoin. Half claimed it was a bubble and all said no. I don't think we're in bubble territory because most people still haven't bought Bitcoin and probably won't until it replaces fiat. By then, "buying bitcoin" wouldn't even make sense. I also understand comparing one Best Buy to the entire world isn't a fair comparison. But I find it true in my personal ventures that most people still don't know about bitcoin or have not yet invested.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:27:17
Any links to the videos?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:20:55
Hopefully the tech will be more inegratdd by then
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:36
Ridiculous. This is why I don't believe in the bubble just yet. They don't even know Darkweb has since moved on to Monero. They don't even know what Altcoins are!
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:40:29
I'm jealous.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:35:34
This current buy isn't because of Thanksgiving FOMO its because of the Koreans.

I am waiting for the day I am insanely rich in fiat to even consider start spending what I have saved up. When a share equals 100k I'll go on a nice vacation no doubt, but I'm also waiting for the day I can buy a coffee in satoshi. Never invest more than you can lose. In the future, I don't know if I'll be willing to lose experiences and joys of a lifetime.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:24:04
It's not that Bitcoin would become the standard, it would have to. All fiat currency has inflated to 0 over time. In the past, people didn't have the option to consider Bitcoin as a form of currency. Now that they do, they will find that BTC is a solid form of storing value as it will never inflate in the way that fiat would. 
In addition, as more and more businesses start seeing the use of block chain they will adopt it and normalize how BTC is used. You said that BTC adapting to have physical use is impossible but it's happening right now with technology such as the TenX card and Nano Ledgers. Starbucks and Goto Mall (620 Korean retail stores) have begun or will begin to start accepting BTC. 
Also have you seen people use Samsung or Google Pay? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:28:15
Omg buy now you fucking fool
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:49:05
How do i sell my soul for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:10:32
This isn't true. Beauty of bitcoin is that you can buy in fractions. Most people actually hold fractions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:43:08
If you try to trade youll fail. If you HODL you GODL
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:40:17
Also ask yourself why you trust fiat so much. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:09:07
There will definitely be a correction at 10k. There is no doubt about it. Major whales are looking to make money now and people are getting weak hands as the price goes up steadily. However, will it be a crash? Probably not, with so much new money about to pour into Bitcoin and with Mike Novostacks doing the Lord's work, Bitcoin is sure to be mainstream in about 1-5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:45
Japanese and koreans are buying
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:35:40
For some reason I think people will buy and we'll pass the 8500 mark.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:40:45
Buying and adapting to the technology. Goto Mall, Hyundai, etc. Etc.
