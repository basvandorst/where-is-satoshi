Nobody leaves crypto on exchanges.  So nobody leaves limit orders open on exchanges (like I'm sure many do for stocks).  Plus, there are no (non-amateur) market makers.  So, order books stay much thinner than they would for a several-hundred billion dollar company's public equity.

Okay, so, players will put in bitcoin, to buy in-game items, to complete objectives?  The entire thing is built on the assumption that consumerism will balance production.  Interesting experiment.  I predict failure.  The company (7C) will inevitably be in charge of a probability distribution that decides creation of new resources, at a rate the creates a "stable" economy.    My mind is exploding trying to bend real-world economics around a system so centrally planned.  They'll need to create in-game interest rates, to give capital time-value, in order for risk-taking decisions to balance.   Since the company can't create bitcoin, they can't control the money supply. So, central planning won't work.  Central planning only works if the planner can adjust the money supply.
Now...what the game will have the ability to control is the probability distribution associated with resource creation/mining/farming.
But...my brain is attempting to digest, but I think...(and I could be wrong here) ...
If they operate "in the red", (costs to mine &gt; probability of reward) the economy will grind to a halt, with insufficient resources to find an equilibrium point.  If they operate "in the black", (costs to mine &lt; probability of reward), then prices will crash (ending the ponzi scheme).  If the algorithm fluctuates, between both cases, people will adapt/catch-on and front-run it - making the game appear "rigged".

He's right.  There is nothing magical about this round "1%".  There will be some competitors who compete on price (Eg 0.2%, for instance?) and some who compete on features (Eg. 1.6%, for instance?).

If you deposited by wire, and expected to withdraw by wire, it's shady of them to raise the "exit" cost, after you're already "in".  It's one thing, if they raise it before you're already a customer - it's another if you already have cash with them.  What if they raised it to $1000?  or $10,000?  
edit: what would be fair, would be to give a 3 or 6 month heads up, to existing customers.

I have 4 thoughts on this.
Contrast the mutual-fund and ETF space against discount brokerage houses now.  The incompetent, pay 1.5% to 2.5% management fees all the time. ETFs succeeded, because they found a way to sustainable compete on price.  Not everybody uses discount brokerages, because they don't know how, or don't have time to bother. So, they pay more in fees.  Nobody openeded  "non-profit mutual funds".
I will say, a non-profit exchange, is an interesting model for the next year or two. In general, I believe the business models of these current exchanges+discount brokerages, will fail.  You need to separate the two. The NYSE doesn't let Joe Plumber open an account, deposit $100, and trade 3x per year.  
The lower bound on fees, that the current bitcoin "exchange-discount-brokerage-houses" can offer are ABOVE what normal fiat-stock discount brokerages can offer.  Unless, they start playing by the same rules.  Normal discount brokerages normally have minimum balances of $1000 or $10000.  This cuts down on a ton of overhead, from customers that would deposit $100, and generate $1.50 in revenue per year.
Also, I expect fees to stay higher than current fiat-stock market discount brokerages because nobody withdraws and then spends stock certificates.  This makes customer loyalty weaker at bitcoin exchanges.  So, higher fees.

If the cash was gifts for your daughter, you should leave it as cash, or bullion.

Canadian here.  If I buy from a US website, and return it, I'm getting the effective USD exchange rate on the purchase day, then on the return day.  Most of the times, I lose a percent or two on both sides of the deal.
Eg. Something is $10 USD.  Right now, spot market is 1.07ish.  The credit card company would use some bank's ask, and I'd get hit with a charge of $10.80 CAD.  If I return it, and the dollar fluctuates to 1.04, I'm going to get $10 USD back, the credit card company would used some bank's bid, and I'd get $10.30 CAD back.
We just live with it.  Cost of doing business.  Many Canadians likely don't even know this is happening.

Maybe this is what it costs to run a successful exchange based in Canada.  The other, more successful, less competent (just earlier), exchange is the Mt Gox of Canada, CaVirtex.  They charge 1.5%.

I'd wager that by 2015ish, we'll see an off-chain trust-based protocol, where a few third parties will operate to provide a very similar, nearly global, mastercard or visa like experience.

The data will be more valuable, because that network will be able to peek into, and make guesses about, your non-card based transactions as well.  The value of this, is unknowable.

Second, the transaction fee-long run, is a highly debated issue, and there are several real-world solutions.  The most likely one, will be that businesses that count on bitcoin to succeed, will roll the costs of money-losing mining operations into their "cost of doing business", then, they'll brag about doing so in marketing.  They will mine "for the public good", however, will really be doing for capitalistic reasons.

The political map is changing.  The internet is getting more powerful.  I'm not worried here.
What I'm about to say is bat-shit-crazy, but, the only thing different between us 'us' (people of the internet) and 'them', is that they build their own prisons and lock people up for breaking 'their' rules.  They also have taxes figured out, plus 'land'.
Think about the things that make a country strong.  A) large number of people B) their own currency C) Leadership D) A charter of rights E) Land F) Sovereign Sustainability (Taxes/Prison/Army)
Now, with "B" pretty much solved, our only challenges left are 'E' and 'F'.
5 years ago, most of us would have called a 'currency of the internet' impossible.  What will our 'Sustainability of the internet' look like?
Why isn't Karpeles in our 'prison'?  Why are we waiting on a Japanese or US court to deal with the SOB?  Most of us would agree, that he broke "our rules".  If we could figure out a 'prison for the internet', than, we could start locking people up for breaking 'our rules'. 
Canada's tax system is 100% voluntary-disclosure.  I would pay taxes to voluntarily join such a country - a country where I belong to the internet - a country which will defend me against my own, or my neighbor, or any entity which will 'handle' those who break 'our rules'. 
I know Americans will be like "Guns" and "Army", but there are lots of countries that don't bother with this stuff.  It's just another method of sustaining control.
Would it be so hard for us to declare a constitution, and then prove to the power-hungry people of earth that the imaginary lines they've spent 100s of years drawing on the planet are barbaric, immoral, and confining?

Make the economic incentive (feel or actually) larger.  If it's large enough, people will adapt.  If it's not large enough, you're more likely to annoy your customer.  Think about that retail cashier asking you to sign up for the loyalty card for StoreYouRarelyShopAt Ltd.

Does he go to sleep every night saying to himself "Well, I tried, they are still trading bitcoin, but I tried to warn them all."  ...like, if they outlawed it tomorrow, somehow overnight, bitcoin goes to $1 - what does he get?  A pat on the back?  In that scenarioe, 90% of the world would be like "We all knew you were right."  ...like, it's not like he'd be able to sell a book, or win a nobel prize or something.

I was opening a USD account at CIBC, explicitly for receiving cash from BTC sales.  I had questions about account freezing.  I was honest with the banker.  But, then he started debating the merit of Bitcoin with me.  The answers, get SOOooo much more personal, when a Banker is asking them.  It was fun, cause I didn't hold back in politely pointing out how expensive, time consuming, inefficient, his "old way" of banking was.

Imagine if bitcoin climbed high enough that 1 satoshi was worth 1 US cent.
Then, there would be a maximum of $21,000,000,000,000.00 worth of bitcoin.  If 1B people wanted $21,000 worth of Bitcoin, than what would be do when the next person wanted $21K worth?  If bitcoin wanted to go higher than that, in terms of value, then trade would start becoming difficult for things that were worth fractions of US cents. 
Bitcoin has flaws, but this isn't one of them.  It's a non-issue.

No. The largest fraction of the voting population, elected liars on promises, to perpetuate decisions made by past elected liars.
And, at best, that fraction of voters is 2/3.  So, even for the winning party, they normally have 1/4 to 1/3 of the population on their side.
So, when you say "We agree to it", what you really should say is "approximately 30% of people agreed to elect the person who agrees to continue to allow rules that were in bulk set by elected people who were chosen by 30% of the previous generation."
The parallels are ominously akin to the cool kids on the play ground making up the rules as they go along.  The cool kids are cool, cause a large fraction, but not even close to the majority, think similar to them - not because they are smart, and not because they are right, but because they are similar.  Their similarity gives them power, and they use that power to retain their power - by making up more rules for them and their friends.  Eventually the majority grow up, and are smart enough to go off on their own.  But the cool kids remain at the helm - they like the power.

The logic is that a hash created from the stream of bytes that make up a file, can be stored on the blockchain.  This effectively adds an irrefutable approximate timestamp proving it existed during the window of time that block was found.  If somebody posts meta data to the blockchain, with the hash, then there's a two way confirmation that is irrefutable.

Bitcoin is (probably) the MySpace of Crypto currencies.  30 years is a really long time for tech.
I don't have the answers, but the concern about the malicious millionaire buying hash power to control the network, would be akin to shooting himself in the foot. 
Bitcoin would collapse in value as the word spread that integrity of the system was compromised.  No way would a multi-millionaire be dumb enough to take the risk that he gets away with investing in (would-become worthless tech) just to rob millions of people.  The worst kind of enemy to have, is an enemy with nothing left to lose.

I bet the ass hole is charging CUMULATIVE fees.  Which means, people who held CAD, and were inactive, were effectively short BTC for 12 months.  So, for simple math, if you have inactive for say only 3 months, you would be charged about 0.33 BTC + 0.33 BTC + 0.25 BTC = 0.91BTC.
I'm a current user, who doesn't owe an inactivity fee, and I plan to stop being a current user ASAP, on behalf of op.

No, on that date, they charged retroactively, in Bitcoin.  So, if you left $1000 in your account for 12 months, you didn't end up paying $50x12 = $600, you ended up paying the $50 equivalent in BTC at each month end, for 12 months. So, for the inactivity fee of say June, July, August, September, Oct, people were charged (approximately) 0.5BTC, 0.5BTC, 0.5BTC, 0.33BTC, 0.25BTC...there was a guy on here complaining about getting charged 2BTC on Oct 31st.

As per our terms of service for dormant accounts, inactivity fees have NOT been charged to date due to our other development priorities.

There will be two kinds of businesses that accept bitcoin: ones that do this, and ones I'll shop at.

I bought $3K on Cavirtex, flipped it to Gox and sold for $3.3K in the hour.  I too failed, cause now I can't get it out.

You didn't hear, we're all criminals &lt;/sarc&gt;

Accurately.  Edit: And, by accurately, I mean correctly.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:09:44
Good point.

I'm done. I'm OUT. I'm OUT. STOP THE CLOCK.  STOP THE CLOCK, I SAID I'm DONE.

Yah, they are retroactive dormancy fees...so, people woke up with a bill for 12 months of inactivity, on October 31st, charged in BTC that they might have not even have owned.  ie...if you had $1000CAD in your account for year, they would have taken it all and you still would owe them more.

I smell 3D printed vanity address key chains coming soon to a reddit sub near you.

What a con job. Who lists a company for 8 months?  The liquidity premium is likely 30% to 40% here, and that's going to vanish on the 18th.  The company has competition coming on strong (Vault of Satoshi) and makes ridiculous business priorities.  Joseph had incredible foresight, but the company needs somebody smarter at the helm now.

Vault of Satoshi.

Why wouldn't a scammer leave 0 BTC in a wallet they were monitoring?

But, can the japanese withdraw USD? or better yet, CAD?

I'm pissed, and I didn't even get hit with the fee.  I feel like nobody is getting how bank-like CaVirtex is operating. It's going unnoticed cause the victims are the passive people, not actively checking their accounts.

If somebody stole ~2% of your net worth, every year, you'd be pissed. No? I'm pissed. Can I call the cops? No...so, what choices do we have? Cross our fingers bitcoin works.

A rose by any other name...

Bitcoin's opened my eyes, about the lengths that some government's go to in order to maintain control over their citizens.  Read up on capital controls in China, Chile, Argentina, India...etc. etc.

We're on the same page.  I don't want regs.  But, this is the jungle now.  As much as you want BTC to maintain a lead, it's centralized tendency for mining, and slow confirmation times, is what gives the runners up a chance.

Then, I suppose the quote "only a sith lord deals in absolutes" is relevant here.  I don't have the academic support you ask for. I have nothing but a decade of experience trading stocks like CSIQ, DRYS, CROX...to name a few of recent note.  Links to charts are below.  The better charts, are of small-cap companies wich ended with de-listing.  That data is harder to link to.

But people don't believe that's theft.  When you call inflation "theft", they reflect.  When you call taxation "theft", they say "nah, you have to pay your way"

Design and build?  $300K.  Just the build part, $60K.

Not really. The merchants' expenses, right now are likely all in his local currency.  He needs revenue, in whatever unit his expenses and liabilities are denominated.
