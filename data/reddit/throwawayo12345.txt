You apparently don't realize that miners can simply mine empty blocks.
Even if you had miners building GB blocks, small miners can just mine off of the headers, still receiving the vast majority of the compensation for mining (this is especially true since the artificially high transaction fees are no longer in play).


This doesn't work over time, only as a one-off. This requires a majority of mining power to signal larger blocks, then refuse.
If greater than 50% of the network is doing this, it is broken anyway. Bitcoin's consensus runs off of the assumption of a majority of honest mining.
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:31:47
These are the LN devs who have stated this.
But see my other comment:














@_date: 2017-02-04 20:55:30
My mistake :|
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:34:35


You really have no idea how LN works do you?
The LN devs have said repeatedly that LN will eventually need ~~500mb~~ 133 mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:06:36


Which only deals with miners not nodes
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:58:33


Hashrate is what matters. Miners with otherwise lower resources keep a natural check on the throughput of the network by simply orphaning blocks ( or by mining empty blocks.


There is nothing disastrous with this since any 'fork' or orphan will include only the coinbase; no other entity is at all harmed by the action other than the individual miner themself.
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:25:54


And people have a problem with that, especially in light of soft forks being sold as 'safe'. The main reason why people run nodes is to get away from SPV and verifying transactions themselves. Soft forks can be seen to be less safe since it gives miners even greater power over the network than a simple hard fork.


I agree....it has everything to do with the current proposal and implementation.


It is central economic planning whereby normal bitcoin transactions are paying for other specific kinds of transactions. There is NO data supporting the subsidy nor the amount specified.
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:22:38


Nothing to do with turning nodes into zombies that don't validate transactions?
Nothing to do with an arbitrary witness subsidy?
Nothing to do with a bad faith implementation with no corresponding HF block size increase?

You assume that there will be centralization.
Also, what is the optimum amount of decentralization before having diminishing returns?
@_date: 2017-02-11 22:33:44
No...I seriously have no clue what you are talking about. 
Please explain how BU creates entry barriers to mining.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:01:48
Well lets look at current constraints
With Segwit it will allow around possibly 7txs/sec
So lets do the math:
7tx/sec x 60 sec x 60 min x 24 hrs x 365 = ~22 million txs/year
LN devs have stated that individuals will likely need to open and close a channel once a month = 24 transactions on the main chain a year
The entire Lightening Network can only support ~9million users WITH segwit under current constraints. Therefore, a blocksize increase IN ADDITION TO SEGWIT will be needed.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:10:37


Like what?
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:28:15
Damn you're thick.
You fail to address my points and simply provide assertions with no actual facts whatsoever.


This is entirely separate from the mining centralization claim and the claim that BU causes mining centralization.
This is the importance of fully validating nodes. However, game theory shows that a majority of the mining community will validate, otherwise, they will open themselves up to being orphaned/forked off of the network.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:11:30


How can I verify **MY** transactions when the inputs are ones that I cannot validate?


Oh really? Where are the data and studies again? I am very interested in reading them.
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:47:59


Where is your evidence and studies backing this up?


By turning them into zombie nodes that don't validate transactions


Lol wut? It is 'easy' to hardfork now, but people must accept those changes. Otherwise it will die very quickly. Nothing is stopping anyone for hardforking at any time whatsoever EXCEPT FOR OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS


They cannot alone provide the scaling needed. LN devs have already said that 500mb blocks will eventually be needed for global use of LN
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:12:53
LN needs 133 mb blocks to go mainstream
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:43:55


Fuck Yeah!
Coercing us by reducing the costs of transactions! Fuck that shit! Each transaction needs to be &gt;$100 in fees to ensure the strength and stability of the network. There is no other way!

It would be the same or greater with a regular node (FYI - the reference client now uses compact blocks).
Before you would receive the transaction, verify it, add it to your mempool, and receive it again with a new block (so it would happen twice). Now you receive the transaction and then receive a hash of the transaction to reconstruct the block.
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:37:17

If you look at the sidebar, please see and (better version is that describes market institutions as replacements for government institutions.
Bitcoin is one, a potential replacement of central banking systems.


There isn't anything to corrupt. Power centers draw corruption because these are given legal sanction to commit what would otherwise be illegal activity - assault (arrest), kidnapping (imprisonment), war (murder), and theft (taxes).
Without state sanction, there is no 'ring of power' to grasp and use for your own ends. Further, states are centrally-planned monopolies, without competition, and no market/price mechanisms. The very things that make monopolies terrible, is the exact same reason why government is poor at everything it does.

Tell that to the 3.7 MB segwit supporters.


Anything that causes a system to be UNNECESSARILY expensive is a detriment to that system. It is economically damaging. Now the question is whether that limitation or cost is necessary to the existence of that system.
Decentralization is the normal justification for the limitation of the block size at 1 MB, but based on current actions by those same supporters, we are not so sure anymore.

What? The payment hubs know exactly where payments are coming from/to. Since the blocks are going to be so limited, this will force centralization where large organizations will know exactly who is transacting and where the payments are going.
It is terrible for fungibility.

How about you define what the fuck a spam transaction is.


You can't unilaterally tell me whether a particular price point is or is not unnecessarily expensive. There is no free floating price mechanism where demand and supply are free to change depending on market mechanisms. 
When supply is capped in a system, it necessarily distorts prices, driving them above what would otherwise exist, while also having a negative effect on the amount demanded in that system.

But with a limited block size, the greater the cost of opening/closing channels, which is a centralization pressure to create fewer hops and create fewer connections with others.
What this results in is a hub and spoke model instead of a mesh network.

You need to keep watch (or involve trusted third parties i.e. watchtowers) to make sure that the other side doesn't double spend by publishing a previous chain state. The same basic security assumptions apply, mainly that miners will pick up your transaction instead of theirs.

I don't know where this statement is coming from and what it is responding to


How do you differentiate increased demand from a spam attack? How do you know what is happening now is a spam attack versus a period of time of increased demand?


I never said that these would be common occurrences. Normal bitcoin usage wouldn't have such large blocks generally. But it is known that people who are attempting to attack the network could flood it with these types of transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:59:30


Nodes do little with regard to the blockchain. The miners have their own networks without any need for otherwise full nodes. They have no real point to play other than relaying transactions (which aren't necessarily needed)
One can run a full node to independently verify transactions and determine which is the longest chain, but full nodes have no real part to play in the digital scarcity of UTXOs
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:35:57

No...again. you clearly have no clue what you are talking about. I AM TALKING ABOUT LN PAYMENTS. Those are signed, unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:29:23
Just move the cursor to the slightly higher end of that range so that your next transaction will go through.
But I would suggest to simply use an Android or iOS wallet instead of multibit for a newer user
Try Mycelium for Android and Breadwallet for iOS
These have simple options for fees to make sure your transaction goes through easily
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:33:59
You in no way addressed my claim because the opening and closing of a channel aren't LN transactions. 
An LN transaction is is simply a signed transaction that has yet to be propagated and included within a block; therefore, it is by it's very nature 0 conf.
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:18:06
There was nothing detailed. These idiots don't understand payments channels and updated channel states (which simply are no broadcast multisig transactions)...but this is lost in them because they don't care to know anything because all they give a shit about is them getting rich.

I didn't. I said 'See Also'....I wasn't using it to support my argument. I was pointing to it for further criticisms.


Like bitfinex or coinbase? Real world examples don't support this. They will support Netsec instead of keeping themselves small. The one good thing about LN, there is less of an incentive to hack anything since funds are tied up in payment channels.

Which is the Blockchain


I don't think you understand what the purpose of a blockchain is.


It is a distributed timestamp server in which proof of work is the means by which the winner gets the opportunity to add transactions to the ledger. The longest chain is is the valid chain. That's it.

@_date: 2016-11-30 01:49:37


That could have been said of the entirety of bitcoin's history up until now. However, it took 7 years for the blocks to become full.
As to spam, any transaction that pays a fee isn't spam.


Do you pay a miner's fee? If so, it isn't spam.


I said unnecessarily EXPENSIVE


Too bad...segwit as it currently stands supports this. Further, the effective transaction amount of segwit is at most what a 2.1 MB block would give under current transaction specs. So for potentially 4 times the network load, we would get at most 2 times the volume. (Whereas if you did a simply increase to 4 MB today, you would get potentially 4 MB of transaction throughput)
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:36:40
One of these idiots thinks that the value of bitcoin is directly related to the scarcity of the block size.

It doesn't matter what a singular miner does.


Such IQ...Much Smart
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:20:27
The counterparty can publish old channel states (effectively double spending)...that is why you must run a full node or hire watchtowers to keep an eye on these malicious actions. My point is that your funds are constantly at risk UNTIL the channel is closed i.e. it has been confirmed and added to the blockchain. All LN transactions are inherently 0 conf with the same basic tradeoffs.
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:43:29


That isn't a rebuttal.
That is an entirely different argument - also called a red herring. Also, these naturally resolve themselves through the use of orphaning.

@_date: 2016-09-13 01:42:51
I still don't see the point. It's variance.
They have to decide whether to publish the blocks or hold them. But they don't know and cannot know at any point if they will be able to get a series of blocks.
They either publish and get the reward or don't and hope that they get several more blocks (which they cannot know)...and only then perform any kind of attack. How they decide to do this at any one point is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:14:23

If I have to trust a bank that holds funds on my behalf and uses LN in the background, what good is it for me?

If miners are willing to create larger ones, what is the issue?
If you have a miner with less resources (by not being able to download and verify transactions), they simply produce coinbase blocks thereby driving down median block size.
If you are concerned about them going broke, why are you then limiting all miners to a reduced amount of fees?
