That few days transaction time is just spreading fud... It only takes long when you’re retarded and send from exchange to exchange 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:54:58
It is not the drop but the reason of the drop! Stop sticking your head in the sand. These are hard times, it’s not just the januari drop. We might come out on top but these are crucial times. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:03
Ok you win :/ :P
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:14:00
Then you will prob be fucked
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:54:03
Cool.. I'll do that when I want to talk price...
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:24:28
Yes thats the law... Like when you own a house... every year you pay a % of how much it is worth... Oh boy... you’re going to have a hard time ^^
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:01:02
Nope... Never has
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:40
Not in the Netherlands though...
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:18:28
No because i don’t need to... I need to tell them how much it’s worth 1 januari and pay a really small % of that number. I don’t know where you live but I doubt thats the case... And if it is it wont be for too long..
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:24:57

Ah dude cmon... Just a troll... Leave it... Don’t be butthurt... If you’re ignorant about hoe Americans behave I have to tell you.. I’ve met Americans sating they’re Canadian at first... Lots of Americans do that when they travel
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:21
You are wrong smiley face... so butthurt... Just face the fact that the whole world is super annoyed...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:23
I don’t see how that is relevant but if it is... Europe invented computing and basicly America it self 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:09
Never income tax but i dont think thats what you mean... they tax you like every thing else you own like a house or something. 1 januari you have to say how much in crypto you own and i think at the end of the year you need to pay for what you owned the start of the year.. sounds weird is weird but thats what it is. Its  0,9% for 25k to 75k or something and nothing up to 25k and above that it slightly goes up in%
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:29:42
This is the Bitcoin chanel... Value is the only thing that matters. Lots of great crypto all with a /r so have fun!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:00:24

@_date: 2017-12-09 01:14:50
And i was right apparently :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:18:42
And thats what I am saying... oh boy... you do have propperty taxes though
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:44
Gratz dude! Don’t ever doubt your choice! Peace of mind is priceless!
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:00:22
I live in the Netherlands and I was adressing the reason of the law.. Unfortunatly the other guy could not see the link.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:03:42
Yea tell that to your self Mr. Moodkill.. BTW I am also talking about human trafficking, better call the cops... You are literally more autistic than an algorithm... Bet thats real great for checking endless streams of Reddit... Wonder what will happen if some one would say "go fuck your self" Would you actually try to sit on it? Well, guess we'll never find out. Have a wonderful day... Now be a good monkey and delete this threat...     
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:51
You’re not up to date.

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:24:30
You are a joke m8... giving up here... like in my first comment or so I made it clear I was not Murican translating the law. Just quit crypto alltogether and just get an education... GL newbie investor and that I mean. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:01:48
You idiots actually hurt crypto trying to skipp your civil duties like paying taxes... it pays gor the light on the streets, the police, medics, health care and so on... hou don’t want to bring any of that, crypto or the economy down...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:16
Jup Muricans are super anoying, still diddnt figure out the internet is the world wide web
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:45
Put your tinfoil hat on dude!
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:42:48
I don’t know where you’re from... Probably America thinking it is just you guys but that is NOT the case everywhere in the world...
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:26:40
I am dutch... And propperty taxes are a thing. Everywhere... Did you assume I was murican? :S
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:09:37
Crypto taxes? you need to pay (translated) property taxes like any other? Thats not how this works? Are you new to this? Dont you own a significant amount of money, a house or shares?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:58:59
No time for 2th places, what was 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:08:12
Not go 100% all in, keep some cash because you never know
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:26:08
Yea no shit... who said they went above 3? As i explained before, like several people in this threat only invest what you can mis... What if shit hits the fan and you lose all? Always keep money for unforseen costs! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:23:07
So a morgage? And we always talk about zero’s so i thought over a milion ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:14:47
That would be illegal..
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:19:08
This is weed
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:26:24
Yea no shit sherlock, I just explained I only count 0’s so I thought mil’s
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:49:46
Soooo... what is the reality? That BTC won right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:37
No it's not
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:44:57
ETH is something completely different than BTC... You can't compare them... Also... it is as it comes to BTC about market cap so people can safely buy milions of it without fucking anything up...
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:47:30
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:41:21
Ah dude for real? Are you like this? I said i was mistaking twice... Just came home loaded with wine from a 7 course michelin star dinner... I might be dumb but atleast I am not toxic and poor..
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:03:22
Ok no clue what this is about...
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:09:37
Hind sight... thats a dumb move and a total bullshit story anyway... where do you get a 6 figure loan? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:29:05
I did stocks from 13 yo on my dad supervised on paper,that was ok :S
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:31:41
This can’t be done where i live.. notary doesn’t agree to a btc deposit. Doubt it worked for you... Where do you live?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:29:59
It’s actually over 8000 so you may already post it but in Japanese only
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:23:38
I dont understand what you are saying?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:45:13
Hilarious i am getting -... lots of internet dwellers in crypto without education and thats ok. Most i’ve put to use i teached my self. Accept English as you can see. But it’s only some cases. For most real knowledge you need the facilities, money and expertise from universities. It’s how we develop our society. Thats why many universities have whole research departments. A lot of stuff you cant do on your own... Lot of ppl lost on the internet with out a life got to crypto as a last and only resort. It’s harsh but its true... Go get educated! Do something with tour life and stop the bullshit anti illuminati bullshit... If you spend too much time on the internet then Bush did 911, the earth is flat and ppl without studies in certain fields are just the same as the ppl that do.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:08:10
This is dumb... Sorry dude
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:31:47
Ah ok so your btc holdings are 1400? I myself hold a decent amount of cash for unpredicted costs. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:51:43
Quickly! Blow your money on hookers and cocain!
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:46:26
I got a job, I do volunteer work and I sold 2 companies... Oh and I got 2 appartments from before BTC without a loan... You don’t understand jack shit since I had the same message and not talking about my self obviously... How are you doing? What handout do I want? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:32:51
What happens when ppl avoid taxes? Crypto gets fucked and regulated to shit... so we need decent regulations so tinfoil hat snowflakes pay taxes and companies can’t get away scamming the idiots like you. Also kiddo... what will you do when you need a morgage? When you want to start a company and want a loan? Yes... Banks... now grow the fuck up
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:33:02
Oh nice! It’s on a poster now... It’s been here for a while...
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:41:27
Oh and also... what is it with crypto kiddies not wanting to pay taxes? Its not even income tax so it’s jack shit and i actually like a decent infra structure, health care and public services... So what is the problem? Made a few bucks and thats the only thing you ever gained your self so you want to hold on to it with your dear life? Welcome to the real world bitch..
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:50:00
How old are you btw? Since you sound so dumb and naive i just hope it’s your age... It’s ok we’ve all been there...
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:06:54
Why do you fools not understand that wee need regulations. We need taxes and we need banks in a certain way.
