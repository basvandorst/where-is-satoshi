Perhaps we can loosely agree that in this context 'bad' can be roughly equated to 'does not support and encourage the freedom of others'

I doubt it, its a pretty common/old block explorer service that a lot of us just use by default because we have forever now. Their wallet implementation is known to be not great and shied away when security is important. Also I don't think it allows you to hand\-pick you seed words.

Releasing a shitty and misleading app is lame - nuking their rating is a valid and natural reaction - these situations are precisely why the rating system exists. They earned it.
Edit: Yes, the coins are recoverable, not lost - but no, users should not be expected to be A-OK with the state of the app.

I recommend Gemini, Kraken, or GDAX for US residents; Bittrex is also an option. Binance (lots of alt pairs) and Bitfinex (lots of volume, VPN required) are good if you have another way of depositing/withdrawing/trading fiat for instance on another exchange. And BitMEX is good for high leverage and maximum rekage (VPN required once to sign up).

Listen man, I don't know how this is going to go and I don't have a degree in economics or any related field. Admittedly, I don't really know shit about shit. But I am wary of how sure you seem to be. Bitcoin changes these 'basics' you have so deftly mapped out - history can only teach us so much about a technology like this. The world has never experienced anything like it, it seems we have precisely 'some mysterious, unexplored frontier' on our hands. /2c

I have no better place to drop this sentiment so i'm about to get all hippie-as-fuck on you here. I love Bitcoin because it stands for freedom and choice.

This is an absurd assumption, there is no clear indication that an all-bitcoin world would not have access to capital. Deflationary currencies may end up encouraging lending beyond current levels - we simply don't know yet. Pretending you have a crystal ball or even a clue is a cute game, but ultimately not useful.
