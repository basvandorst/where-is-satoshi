You send the merkle root and previous hash to the computer and they test nonce's one by one locally. If they find the correct nonce, boom done. 


No I want it so *everybody* has 0 fee's. Honestly I don't understand how you cannot stand this simple concept. If people mine for free, you send it for free. EASY. EVERYONE would have lower fee's. You want to pay a ton of money to send bitcoin so a couple miners can make money? Be my guest dude. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:56:23
The only reason transactions fees are so high is because people are mining for profit.
What if mining was a 24/7 thing that all Bitcoin holders did in the background, instead of a few select groups trying to profit? Would solve a lot of issues, but decentralization is a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:41:42


You obviously didnt read my original post. They only buy specialized hardware to do it faster to make more money. 
It doesn't work for gold mining because not everyone has a gold mine with them, aka a mineable device. Phone, laptop, anything. People say you can't use a regular laptop to mine, because *its not profitable*. 
If *everyone* was constantly mining, wouldn't the cost per person be extremely low? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:17:16


This is *not* what I am proposing. I am suggesting that we use Proof of Work on a global scale. Everyone mining towards the same block all the time. Worried about the difficulty getting too high? Only use a subsection of the users to mine, and ramp up as the difficulty gets higher for a steady stream of transactions. The cost per person is low as the amount of work each person has to do is extremely low.
The only problem, like I originally said, is keeping it decentralizied. But theres no way Bitcoin mining can be profitble in the long run without crazy high fee's or a drastic change to the architecture/break through in mining tech, so shouldn't we look for an alternative?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:14:44


Only. If. Miners. Make. Money. There are only fee's because we at the moment *have* to pay people to mine. That is a choice, not an outcome. 
You are a broken record just saying the same thing, over and over. Think about what I am saying and how it would work. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:51:43
But if the miners did it for free, there would be 0 fees right? There are only fees because the miners are getting paid. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:35:27
But what’s more efficient, a group of people with specialized hardware or millions of people doing the work concurrently? 
I understand how bitcoin works, and the difficulty involved but if you have enough people attempted hashes for each block I’m positive it would be more efficient. 
I find it funny that a decentralized currency relies on people mining for profit when mining for profit is not sustainable in the long. Doesn’t it make sense for a decentralized currency that everyone uses, to be worked upon by everyone?

Why would they need to download the entire blockchain? People who use mining pools don't need to download the entire thing, this is essentially the exact same on a bigger scale.

I was thinking of a max hash rate for equality. If everyone is hashing at the exact same rate, there is no issue with who gets the Bitcoin reward. 
If everyone is doing a little bit, I don't think so. And if we are able to develop new technology for "slow" mining, Mining could just become a thing all devices do.

If the person buys 100m of BTC, it will wipe out 100m from the exchange's BTC offers. What is the price now? It is the highest price someone is offering to sell one for (Which after 100m is bought, will be lower). Now that same company can buy all the BTC back at a lower cost, and make profit out of nothing. 
BTC = 20k.
Listings are as follows.
20k, 19.9k, 19.8k, 19.7k, etc down to 18. 
If you buy all the BTC offers down to 18k, now BTC is worth 18k to you as you can just buy the next offer for lower.

All the power is used to get the reward, and to also verify that work was done and that a new block is valid.
Blockchain uses a "proof of work" system, inwhere in order to add a block to the chain it must meet certain rules.
If someone wanted to change 1 block in the chain, they would need to do *all* the work of the blockchain to prove its accurate (because they would need to find every Nonce), to get everyone to accept it as the new Blockchain. Since miners are constantly adding to the real blockchain, it's pretty much impossible without a 51%+ attack.

If you have a channel with your buddy, and he has a channel with the shop, you could send your BTC through your channel and they would end up getting it. 
As long as the channel is open, the final transaction hasn't been broadcasted yet. So if you still think you can get more BTC, you will keep the channel open so you don't have to accept a non-favorable offer. 
Your channel with your buddy is 1 BTC. He sends a request to give you 0.5, and him 0.5
If you both like this, you can close the channel and broadcast this.
But if you are paying him later, leaving it open and changing it to 0.4/0.6 or vice verca is instant and free. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:53:44
The way fees work for Bitcoin is based on the amount of work that the miners have to do.
A transactions contains a certain number of bytes, and the fees are usually in a per byte format.
But, the size of the transaction is not necesarily linear with the amount you are sending.
For example, a $4500 transaction of mine was 373 bytes. but a transaction of $200 was 226. So you may have paid more in fee's than you originally expected.

I think we need to start thinking of a new way to mine Bitcoin/transactions. Right now its based off profit, but with the way Bitcoin is going in the long run it won't be profitable with crazy high fees.
Plus, the only reason Bitcoin has fee is because of mining being profitable. What if every device was mining, all the time? It would be so little that it wouldn't effect the electricity bill, but having a system that utilizes that many devices could mine quickly and efficiently.

You could, but you don't have to use the same address twice. My wallet creates a new ID for me every-time I go complete a transaction.

They essentially borrow the BTC and sell it right away, and then the future is what they think the price will be so they will buy it back and make money.
Since the price has gone up, they have to buy the BTC at a higher price. But you are right these seem virtual.

The transaction will be instant (as in, it will say its completed) but it may take a while for you to see the charge on your credit card/see the BTC.
This is because of the high volume of trading thats happening, so Coinbase does "side trading". They essentially save your transaction in a DB, amount paid &amp; BTC at that specific time, and then later when they are able to give your BTC you will receive it.
They will not charge your CC before the BTC gets put in, or if they do its a small delay.

Please watch the video I linked, it literally explains all your questions. You send back a refund address; the merchant doesn't have to "trust" you as after 30 days no matter what happens, worst case scenario your funds are returned in 30 days. 
You open a channel with a coffee shop for a certain amount and you sign a refund address so after 30 days the BTC is refunded. 
No, that is not how LN is going to work. And your lack of knowledge about LN shows me you have literally no idea what youre talking about, and you don't want to because you haven't taken the 10 minutes to learn about the protocol.

I was thinking more of putting regulations on mining to avoid companies abusing their user's by installing mining software for personal profit.
If everyone was constantly mining towards the same block, but on a decentralized system so a 51%+ attack couldn't happen, BTC transactions could be faster and free. We only pay BTC transactions as people are trying to profit off mining.

I watched a video of 2 guys explaining (all be it [from 2015]( but you essentially make 1 transaction on the block chain, and then the person sends a refund transaction so worst case scenario your funds are locked up.
Now you have a channel to that person. You can do transactions under the initial limit as many times as you want, and then as soon as you want to finalize the amount you write the final amount to the blockchain. 
If the modern LN works in a different way, someone please correct me.

Not necessarily banning it, but putting regulations in place like a "max hash rate" so that people's hardware isn't getting destroyed, and having a max hash rate regulation would help with scaling so blocks aren't added too fast, etc.  
I don't want to ban mining, I want *everyone* to mine, *all* the time. For a P2P system with no central authority to work, the P2P user's have to do the work. 
I also don't want a centralized system, which is why we would have to think of a way to operate mining with no central authority. Maybe have a Blockchain that is used to track mining? Not really sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:31:10

You do need channels but it’s not a new wallet, it’s just a channel between two wallets. You send an amount of bitcoin to the other person, this gets recorded on the ledger. The person sends a timed refund transaction so at worst the funds are locked up.
Once this happens the two people can send an amount between each other (up to the initial transaction) and it’s instant and free. Once they are done they sign it and the final transaction is broadcasted .
That’s how I understood it :o

Buy at the point where you believe you will garner the most profit. If you are buying and hodling, sooner rather than later (depending on recent prices they have been very high).
If you are buying to make passive income from escrows, try and buy when BTC is low and transfer when its gone up. You can essentially pay for fees this way.

Escrow services that pay out daily returns. You can get 2-3% back per day with certain trade groups (initial deposit is included in daily profits). Some of these will 2.5x or 3.6x your money in 90 and 180 days respectively. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:54:03
It doesn’t matter what type of wallet you have. It’s not a change to the system, this is protocol to be implemented onto of the existing bitcoin code. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:21
Do you think in the future if technology gets more advanced, the BTC can eventually be recovered? (through brute force with next level computers, more sophisticated hacks, etc).
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:47:50
But i didnt buy december 3rd I bought on the 7th :(
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:14
By the time my escrow service stops paying out I should have 1 BTC, hopefully prices don't go up too fast.

Everyone always says “don’t invest what you can’t lose”. OP is suggesting exactly that, and you accuse him of not thinking logically? Come on. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:54
Yeah that was my bad I got it backwards in my head, thinking they bought and then sold. But it's actually them selling it instantly and buying it back at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:18:38
Can someone explain whats going on here? I am very confused.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:00
Definitely, just have to make it known so people don't panic sell.

Oh really? I thought it supported all Eoc2 currencies. Maybe try and find a different type that can? I hear Trezor is really good too.

Thats exactly what I was thinking, quantum computer's could prove a threat to some encryption, not sure how much it would effect crypto though. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:50
You would order your wallet online. 
You get the wallet, plug it in, and go through the set up process. write down the seed words, etc.
Then, go and download either the Chrome App or Chrome Extension. Plug in your hardware wallet and set it up for the firs time. Through the apps you click "receive" and you will get an address.
Go to coinbase, and send from coinbase to gdax to the wallet for lower fees.
Straight from coinbase to the wallet if you don't have gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:14
When I chose when to buy, I also think about how high it will go up *in a percentage* to try and guess my gains. 
What I mean by this, is say BTC is at 13k all week. If it drops to 12.5k, you can be fairly confident it will go back up to at least 13 so if you invest you will gain 4% on your investment.
Spreading your investments out over time helps combat the volatility. You may buy high and low a few times, but then it will average out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:42:35
and i imagine the wait times are pretty long right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:46:15
if you buy BTC on an exchange, they will most likely keep it in their online wallet. As soon as you get your hardware you can send them from your online exchange wallet, to the ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:40:17
No, you open a direct channel with me and you deposit some BTC in there. The wallet is multi-sigged, me and you. This is broadcasted. From there I send you a 30 day refund address, so worst case scenario you get your funds back in 30 days. You can request the channel to be closed after the payments are done, I can accept or wait till end of the month. 
If I wait too long, none of the transactions that we did were broadcasted so it didnt happen. If I sign the channel is closed, the transactions are broadcasted and the funds are confirmed. All the network see's is the final payment from the multi-sig wallet.
You essentially open a direct channel to send micro-payments as many times as you want.
You obviously have not read the wiki or watched the video, as this is common knowledge. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:25:48
Ah so you can use a keyword to create a subwallet?
Is there a way to see a list of all the subwallets? What happens if you forget a subwallets passcode?
It did help, thank you! This is for the Nano as well?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:42:35
The Lightning Network does the channel creation for you, it's not something you manually have to do. 
What if you have a channel that a big hub doesn't? Can you compete then? What gives a company incentive to run their own "huge hubs"? Do they get paid for it? What if no one wants to open a channel with these hubs. What then? 
The Travelling Salesman problem assumes that you can fly from any city to any other city (aka 100% connected). The lightning network will never be 100% connected, so the complexity to solve the problem is much much less than the Travelling Salesman problem. Also the distance between each city matters, whereas the 'distance' between channel's here is practically irrelevant. They can trade as fast as they can communicate (internet boi)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:50
They definitely aren't, there was a case where someone shorted a company and the next day it went up 800% meaning he was responsible for his initial investment * 8 to cover his deal. 
It doesn't really matter that the selling party is betting on the price to go up. If an investor can buy a ton of BTC at a certain price (and not necessarily on the exchange, could be P2P or BTC loan, and start selling it off to drop the price and create FUD, inexperienced traders may start to sell their BTC and it could cause a collapse where the investor buys back the BTC at a lower price and makes profit. 
I am not saying that this is 100% going to happen, but it's a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:13

Lightning Network channels will naturally tend to form along the paths of economic activity. If you assume (as I do) that most economic activity in Bitcoin today is from individuals to large Bitcoin businesses (mostly exchanges), then you should further assume that most channels will be between users and those very same large businesses.
You can call the centralization if you wish---but it is not a centralization of Lightning's making; it is a centralization that already exists for Bitcoin users.
Moreover, even though Bitcoin commerce and trading is dominated by large businesses, there are quite a few of those large business. I haven't looked up figures, but I would suspect that Bitcoin commerce has a much less centralized distribution than mining at the present time---and with new businesses offering Bitcoin-payable services all the time, Bitcoin commerce would seem to be in a steady of progressively becoming more decentralized.
Nope, thats where you're wrong. Lightning Network would fix the 400 satoshi's for a coffee, but you are crying about 'centralization'. Too funny.

If Merchants end up having enough active channels, they could offer their channel's for use at a fee.
Like if Starbucks had channels to major exchanges, you could pay Starbucks using their channels for a % etc.

The percentage between each 1000 gets lower each time. At first you had to double your price, now you only have to increase by 7-8% to gain 1000 dollars. Soon we will be leaping 1000's. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:27
*If* the government touches anything, maybe regulating mining. When BTC gets to the point where mining is not profitable, it will fall on the users to keep the blockchain running and everyone contributes to mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:52:43
Ahh I see what you mean, my apologies!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:33
An exchange that doesnt use SegWit handled a ton of transactions potentially, skewing the percentage? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:26
When investing, ask yourself how much you think the BTC will go up (percentage) by the time you want your payday.
If you think it will double, you will make $100. Do some research and try to buy at a dip to get as much BTC as possible (And I mean like a 2-3% dip, not 10% plus). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:25
Check out the [wallet]( of the guy who stole the BTC from NiceHash. I was cringing for a different reason.

That’s what I was thinking too. Maybe they are confident there will be enough free hubs that using the corporate ones will be optional?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:46
I thought LN was just a protocol on the current system. I don't think it will create a middle-man. The [wiki]( even says its P2P. There is a 3rd party for 'delegating' funds but it still P2P.

If you sent a massive amount of BTC between 2 wallets back and fourth, would it affect the price since the “daily traded” amount would be heavily affected?

To be honest I don't use Coinbase that much, I just know that you can transfer between Coinbase/Gdax for free :/ Sorry!
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:14:49
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The tech is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical computer science most of the words will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Bcash and Ethereum, which is deftly woven into this subreddit- What fools.. how I pity them. ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:48:29
Wouldn't it be better to take your pay as normal and monitor the market and buy at a good price? If you sign a contract and BTC falls, you could be making a lot less money,

It's not Satoshi's Mistake, its the way Bitcoin is being used for profit. The only reason its so popular is it's speculative value, there is no real lower bound.. at the moment. As soon as a country or lots of major corporations start accepting Bitcoin and it becomes more useful, its value will be not as closely tied to speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:43:53
I was on Coinbase and they bought instantly. Is this because I paid a higher fee so it bought instantly?
Should I set a lower fee and just wait it out? Can you even set your own fee? I am very new to BTC/Coinbase.

I think it’s to increase your credit limit? When I signed up I had to take a picture of my ID.
It makes sense though. They need to be sure the CC’s aren’t stolen and just giving away BTC they can’t get back. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:15:25
LOL savage man, BTC is just the implementation of block chain. When someone says they don’t understand BTC, it’s usually because they don’t know what Blockchain is.

If someone can break SHA256, there is ALOT more to be worried about than mining faster. They could fake any block in the system and it would be accepted as fact.
Also the team that cracked SHA-1 and it took 110 years of computing time, for 1 collision.

I personally use an escrow service called Chaingroup. I buy weekly from Coinbase, send a portion to Chaingroup to invest for daily returns and then the other amount to a wallet to HODL. It’s fun!

Thank you for the steps! When you say “open your hardware wallet”, what do you mean by this? Like physically or is it a location on your computer?

Here man, think about it this way. If you truly believe Bitcoin will be worth a lot some day, it doesn't matter when you get in. As long as it increases from when you bought it, you will profit.
Coinbase.com allows you to make weekly deposits. Maybe quit eating fast food/drinking for a week and every month put a little bit towards it.
Eventually you will have enough that as it price grows, you make money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:55

Yes but he sold 2000 BTC, on the same exchange, at the exact same time. If that one exchange drops by quite a bit from that huge purchase, depending on which exchange it was, other exchanges could correct their prices to match.
But you are right, it's possible that they aren't related. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:02:52
