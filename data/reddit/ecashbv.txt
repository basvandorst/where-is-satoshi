Bitcoin nodes run on servers. Servers can be traced and shutdown.

There have been rumours that Capital One is in talks with Ripple Labs. And they're building a Capital One Labs just down the road of Ripple HQ,

The thieves knew the private keys, right? Don't believe the lies. There is no evidence of coins having moved. The "stolen" coins simply never existed. MtGox was selling fake Bitcoins out of thin air. The fiat profits were transfered to Mark's Hong Kong subsidiary. Follow the paper money trail and you will find the stolen money. No coins were lost, because they never existed.

You can't kill the ability to mine in pools, it's just pooling of hashing power. 
Bitcoin essentially allows for mining centralization. That's a flaw in Bitcoin that requires core dev attention.

Bitcoin can do 7 tps. I've heard that Ripple tested with 1000 tps. But still nowhere near what Visa can do.

There is still NO evidence of MtGox coins having been stolen. He continues to lie to us all.

eBay could offer a '100% merchant protection using Bitcoin irreversible payments' service. But then again, that would hurt a lot of consumers.

Bitcoin has to grow through this phase so it can be perfected in a few years down the road.

Using the blockchain as a social network database is quite inefficient.

Like Roger Ver, we should set up an anonymous bounty for information leading to the real story of what happened at MtGox.

When you send Bitcoin from an address, all coins are sent, but the change is sent back to another address in your wallet. Scary, but that's how it works.
I assume this is your change address and belongs to your wallet:

He won't find more coins, because there never were any more. He invented them out of thin air. MtGox was selling fake Bitcoins. It worked because people did not withdraw the Bitcoin.
He scammed us for half a billion dollars.

Apparently, terrorists also use paper cash. Nothing will happen to Bitcoin.

In 2013 Bitcoin wast mostly used to buy drugs on black markets. In 2014 those people started using various altcoins instead. Altcoins have killed Bitcoin's only real use case.

Depends on how many people succeed at filing a claim. How many had verified / notarized accounts? Less than 5%?

Perfect. A mix between 'every popular social network' and you 'have no idea where to start'. But you heard the word 'blockchain'.
It makes no sense at all to use a blockchain database for building web applications. It would be extremely, ridiculously slow and inefficient.

No new Bitcoins can be created through double spending. There is a fixed limit of 21 million Bitcoins.
Double spending does not mean "the creation of new Bitcoins". Double spending means the same Bitcoin was spent twice, but one of the two spends will eventually be discarded.

Bitcoin has no real world use case yet. It makes no sense to buy Bitcoin to spend it. It's a speculative instrument for now.
It would be great if Western Union adopted Bitcoin. That might be a good business case, much better than PayPal/eBay.

It coincides with the 30K Bitcoin sale by the FBI. We're in for a small crash :)

Bitcoin is the value, the tax is the value-added tax, as in, added to the value. You don't actually need to add any value yourself. It's the value that is taxed. But I guess you're just an uninformed troll anyway.

The rest of the Gox coins doesn't exist. Never did. MtGox sold fake coins out of thin air.

We're finally in the 'panic' phase of the bubble. It took a while, but now's the time when smart money starts buying.

I agree, scam. Ether presale is uncapped, and ether doesn't even have a live product. That means it's untested on large scales. What. if. it. doesn't. work.

Point is, Bitcoin will be replaced by something better in the near future. Happens to all new tech.

Remember Coinbase buys their Bitcoin from Bitstamp every day. They just ran out of their daily stash.

'Economies of scale' force Bitcoin mining to become a centralized effort. Miners will not accept decentralized solutions with lower returns.

FYI - Don't throw away your MtGox postcard from Japan. It contains a unique number (in this example: 2- which may be used to verify your physical address when filing claims. Each card has a different number. So don't post it reddit either...
