Listen guys and girls. I am a former police officer and Investigator in the United States. I do my research like everyone else should . It is obvious there are many people and some with power, trying to make Josh and GAW look bad and fail. Wise up ! They do not want to see Paycoin succeed ! Some of it is jealousy and another part of it is plain greed. I have purchased 300 XPY, I know that is nothing on the scheme of things but it is all I could afford. I wish I could afford 1000 XPY more ! I never sold one coin, I held all my XPY because I felt in my judgement that Paycoin will be much bigger than the so called $20 Paycoin. I know there are several people that bought XPY and is hurt or disappointed. I feel you, but Josh is human, give him a break . You are going to have to have some patience and let things play out. People who are calling Josh and Paycoin a scam really?? Take a look at this  , now look at who is one of the sponsors on the freakin home page of the North American Bitcoin Conference where leaders around the World will be speaking , including Josh ! One of the Sponsors is "Paybase"! Still believe a scam ? Are you serious ? Josh is on the website as one of the speakers. What other proof do you need. If he or GAW or Paycoin or Paybase was a scam , the man would be on a private jet with his family getting the heck out of dodge and running away. Please people use your common sense for once. Think about it. Stop hating and start supporting ! I am not an employee of Gaw, I am a person who bought XPY in the belief it is going to be huge one day and yes, make some good money as a profit. What we should be doing is supporting Josh by doing what you can and maybe attending the event coming up in Miami,Florida. We stand together and support Josh, and Josh does what he says and gets each phase completed for us, that's when the price goes up! Just my 2 XPY worth and thanks!
