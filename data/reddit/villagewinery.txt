I read this as more of "distributed decision making" than processing.
Central-planning leads to a lot of cronyism and stupid decisions, like "let's put this power plant in the middle of a swamp" or "let's build this railroad to nowhere" because Party Offical A said so instead of there being any economic or logistical benefit to doing so. When economic reality is set aside for back-scratching and favor-grubbing, the system will fail over the long term because loyalties change and the I'm-a-friend-of-Party Official A-gravy-train eventually stops running.

Wow, old wired article. For a brief time in the 1990s, being a technology geek and being a fantastic investor coincided -- but historically those two things don't go together. I used to have a poster in my cubicle about how Cisco was going to dominate the earth. Go look at their stock chart at around 1999...
Stock picking is essentially a game of chance, and the world has moved on to ETFs and indexing as a result.

Money is money, no need to think of it as "institutional". Customers tell the institutions what to do. Hey Joe, I want to invest in crypto assets. If you don't offer entry into that market I'll go find someone who will. 
There are plenty of people in the world who are comfortable owning an asset as part of a portfolio, and who never, ever, will go make a paper wallet or buy a trezor, or do shit with coinbase. They want to click a box on their trading website or 401K form. 
I realize there's a zealotry around fiat currency, decentralization, and the like, and those reasons are valid to advocate bitcoin. Plenty of people in the world don't care about it though. That's a fact. Institutional involvement in bitcoin may not mesh with your "ideals" but bitcoin doesn't care what your ideals are. Anyone can participate in the market including big investors/banks/trading houses. The more the merrier, I say.

What makes you value one purchase or sale more than another purchase or sale by a different account? Whale, trading bot, guy at home in underwear . . . it is all part of price discovery and information exchange.

Yeah, in the history of the world primitive people have never fought over resources, totally a modern invention. /s
Of course you share everything when you live a subsistence life. You waste your time digging for grubs in the dirt with no time for anything else. Let's all sit around and share grubs.

You can be sure the big banks and other competitors are laying the FUD on thick so they can buy low. What Dimon is doing should be illegal if his bank is planning to offer crypto trading or other products. He knows he can get away with it though because bitcoin is "unregulated." Also the SEC has its head up its ass anyway, and if you believe most of the articles written about them, most SEC employees dream of jobs at Goldman, only they weren't smart enough to make it in the first place . . .
I am not savvy or connected but I know someone working on crypto and several people I know have bought some. They usually say "I have a little ... glad it is just a little!" when we talk about it -- thanks to recent price drops. 
Don't fret too much about Wall St. They are the whales that will bring lots of money to crypto eventually, but bitcoin is global. When you realize you can't beat 'em, you are forced to join 'em.

This is exactly right. Risk goes hand-in-hand with reward. At some point every investment is a mixture of knowledge and belief. We know, or "think" we know something, we bring some skills to the party, and maybe with our knowledge and experience we can see that the risk is not all that bad, given other factors (willing to wait for returns over the long term, for example). 
That said, if you believe that bitcoin is worth the risk, for say a 10x or 100x return, small-scale risk won't help you that much. Turning $100 into $1,000 isn't much, but $10,000 into $100,000 could be life-changing money for a lot of people. 
I'm old enough to remember people saying Google was "done" when it was $300/share. Oh if I had only invested back then... Amazon stock did nothing for a decade before 2010, hatred for the stock was universal pretty much. We all should have been buying. 
All I'm saying is that the value being poured into bitcoin globally is astronomical -- the miners, the developers, the merchant networks, the competitors and exchanges -- everyone is scrambling. And bitcoin has 50% of the crypto space still -- and we know how network effects work, a-la Facebook. It is winner-take-most and there really is no 2nd place. 
I am buying as much as possible and shooting for life-changing money. I wish I had started earlier, but I equate today with Google at $300 and everyone thinking they missed the boat.

I agree with you to a point but modern federal reserve models are chasing what they deem to be a "natural" interest rate. In a deflationary environment (high debt, aging demographics, trade barriers) the natural interest rate could go negative and stay there for some length of time. If so then central bankers will chase it. To them their models are very  "sane".

There is no such thing as purely "passive" investment. Investment is always "work" to some extent even if it is doing the risk analysis to decide where to invest. There is always the risk someone paying interest to you will stop doing so, or a bondholder will default, or a renter will stop paying rent. To the extent many of these things can be put on "auto-pilot" so you are not managing them, you are paying a middleman to "manage it" for you via incremental fees.

Gold was great in a world of 7%-12% inflation. But now we live in a world of 0% and negative interest rates . . . and internet money now exists.

Actually everyone "phrases it like that" because that's what DCA is; DCA is buying at timed intervals regardless of price. That includes when the price is rising.

Central banks are extremely conservative when it comes to inflation. I assume you're talking about the US Fed and treasury as "they" since you are referring to dollars. Or are you talking about global central bank collusion? There is no reason for them to torpedo the world's reserve currency just to try to corner the Bitcoin market. It is bad policy first and foremost, but currency market manipulation is outside of their mandate in any case. Not to mention global central banks are in a delicate competition with each other to maintain market balance. Nash equilibrium and game theory.

This makes no sense. Inflation is commonplace and the economy functions just fine. In 10, 20, 30 years dollars will be worth far less by design and Bitcoin will be more scarce by design. The dollar doesn't need to fail to be worth less in relation to Bitcoin or other currencies. Worth less and worthless are not synonymous.

You can convert it to cash at a Wal-Mart. Just go to the customer service counter and they can do it for you. If you have to run it as a debit card transaction, the last 4 digits on the card are used in place of the PIN. 
There may be a small service fee. I think I paid $.80 or something to cash out a $50 gift card.
