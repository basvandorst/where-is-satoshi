I checked their website, in the faq they says: "The EOS Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation, any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the EOS Platform."
They promise to realise a code at some point in time as open source and say someone might use it! This looks very suspicious.

Based on your comments history in support of Bcash and insider trading this of course is a no story to you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:08:31
This is you 3 days ago:

@_date: 2018-01-19 09:01:53
what do you use now instead if not Australian ones?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:03:59
Dumb people would quote someone to defend an argument and then pretend like the quote was just a random comment.
Dumb people have all their comment history on reddit in defend on bcash and they think they can ignore as it never happened.
Dumb people support a shit coin and they thing they are relevant.

Why does he have his shirts on?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:25:27
That doesn't prove anything by itself.
To know it for sure you need to go to that transaction and see if there are more than 2 outputs on the transaction. 
A combined transaction should have at least 3 output (1 change and at least to 2 other address)

What is the source?

You probably haven't checked the backlog recently.
Last time I checked it was 19k and the highest in the past 24hours is 34k.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:38:33
I am from Australia and I use our local options rather than going through coinbase. As long as you do not keep your bitcoin with your exchange anything but coinbase should be fine.

Isn't there a problem that for buying a coffee (in this example) one needs to pay in advance a month worth of coffee when opening the channel ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:30
And there hasn't been a single BCash sale in the past 20 minutes there (12:22:53). 
They probably halt the sales now that people are taking advantage of their game.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:13:07
If you are for the long run it is always a good time to buy.

Do you happen to know what API or languages do they use to develop these sites?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:51:02
keeping 10 percent or as the OP says up to 1 percent as deposit and them magically provide the missing 90% is making money out of thin air.
Keep in mind most banks in Australia ask for 20% deposit. So what they do is they keep half your deposit (10%) and magically give you 80% loan of a money that they never had then they use the other 10% to give someone else a similar size loan of again of money that never existed.

What about all trades before 12:22:53 that took the price up to $9500?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:59:16
Which exchange? Please provide the transaction link, would be interesting to see if this is real or one of those zero fees transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:45:36
It is not sad nor weird. Bitcoin hasn't even got to 10% of its adaption potentials yet. There are many more exciting years to come to see the full impact of Bitcoin and its true adaption potentials.

It's an alt coin.

This was the 7th time this year and I believe the second time in less than 5 weeks.
Nothing out of ordinary.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:32
Didn't you edit your comment? I swear I read it as it was about making more profit.
Otherwise now it sounds like you are saying it is 10 times harder to get to 120k and it is only for people who believe in the idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:02:21
$1100 fee for 1 transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:59:11
Anything that has fee is not a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:47
I would really love to read your material. The one that says the current price of a currency is just a price of it sales somewhere in its history.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:50:08
Your math does not make sense.
1-12k is 12k time increase 12k-120k is just 10 times.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:04

I don't live in America so I can't do anything for this but to all American bitcoin redditors: "Call your congress and let them know bitcoin is your property which you obtained with your hard earned money and next election you will remember how they voted to protect your property"

There hasn't been a single real transaction on GDAX in more than 20 minutes now. That price is just as fake as it gets.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:05
We were all happy for bitcoin to get to 9k a week ago. Even if it goes that low it will bounce back in a month.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:29:48
That is exactly what I said. There hasn't been in a single transaction on GDAX in hours now.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:52:56
I think you will be on the next block!
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:35:54
Price of property and you don't have any clue what you are talking hence. Bank has to have %10 of all its outstanding loans as reserve not 10% of all the deposits.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:23:59
It is always nice to hear the banks side of the story.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:58:45

How much bitcoin does he have?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:39:31
So Australian banks don't let their customer use their own money because they can't then offer 100 times of the amount as loan to other people and make more profit out of nothing. If that is not a Ponzi scheme I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:49:58
Would be very nice and helpful if you provide more details.  Maybe on the wiki so people can contribute too.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:32:27
That is true. The price was 11,315.40 on 4th Dec.

Browser history skit.
Wife asks why the browser history clean itself.

6 months ago the price would have been around 4-5k. Unless his friends wanted to all buy late December they should all hate him.

I skimmed over the content as it was too technical for me but from my understanding as an end user I won't really notice any difference to the way things were before or I am missing something?

It is not a visa or mastercard debit card?

I think it is going to go up toward $14000 and then the deep is going to be close to $10k but not below.

I am 40 and I always thought this was for people in their early 20s. 
No one in his/her 50s-60s would watch this.
I believe, people in their 30s and 40s are the ones who hold the majority of bitcoin.

Why did you keep your bitcoin with them and not your own wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:34:11
Is the payment to your wallet or from your wallet?

That is very interesting but what I am trying to see is how this compares to lotto. 
Say I buy that USB dongle for $29.99 and run it for a week, how are my chances (mathematically) compared to buying a $29.99 ticket a week before a lotto draw?
