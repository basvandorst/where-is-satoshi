I think you should add Bluewallet to the mobile section. Really good wallet.

OpenNode is also good, and much easier than doing it by yourself :)

You say that you wallets are non-custodial. Can I use the private key (the 12 words) on another bitcoin wallet and use my funds? Or do I need to withdraw them from the abra app to another bitcoin wallet? 
If I'm dependet on that the abra wallet is working, my coins could be locked up in the app. (Say some random update would make it not possible to extract the bitcoins).

Great wallet! Love it!

This is great, you are doing good work. But also be careful with this as if one guy gets too big he can sell information on who is making what payment.   
Still good work! :)

You gotta start somewhere. :)

As  said, inflation may be higher. Look at shadowstats or chapwood index if you wanna see how much the inflation is if we count as we did in the 80s/90s.

I really wanna support bussiness like this, but if it is cheaper to buy with paypal, I will use fiat before using my bitcoins. Bitcoin should be cheaper to pay with.

Tsingtao is the biggest beer brand in China and it is pretty meeh. Atleast it is cheap :)

I did that like a year ago, so please do. If more people do it, maybe they will add it :)

Please don't use bitpay, they suck for customers. Use OpenNode instead. You also get lightning support with opennode.  [

I think you get ahead of yourself. It will take a long time before we are at $100 fees....
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:29:53
OpenNode is easily the best. You also get lightning with opennode! :)  [  Backed by Tim draper
