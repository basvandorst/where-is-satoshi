Bear markets aren't dips. Could trigger a multi month or multi year slide before recovery. Crypto would benefit more from a fast recovery.

We need to get the price above 12.5 today or we'll turn Bearish 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:06:45
There’s a high degree of support at that number. Two plus days above 12.5 is supposed to mean bullish according to the analysts. Of course they’re often wrong.

When you put it like that it makes me want to sell lmao

I’ll get downvoted to hell but I was raised to see conversations about money as a sign of ill breeding and I’m shocked how often people here get asked about it.

All of Elon Musk’s net worth is in his companies, to the point where he’s had to crash on people’s couches. Lack of liquidity doesn’t mean lack of assets.

It was for institutional investors who can withstand a multi-year bear market before their position goes black. Individuals who keep sinking money into a downward trend assuming it will come back up is risky.

He doesn’t need to sell it. He takes his stock to the bank and offers it as collateral for a nice juicy loan while still maintaining his equity.

I just did that tonight. If you can find the private key for the wallet your money was on, you can sweep it into Exodus very easy

Ya you just go to Wallet&gt;Private Keys&gt;Export then you put in your password and it lists all the addresses you have with their corresponding private keys. Copy the private key into relevant field in Exodus and boom free money.

If you had invested $100 in Gold and $100 in the DOW in 1918 you would now have $80 and something like $200,000 respectively. Can't remember the exact stat.

That’s why deflation is deadly to economies. No one spends there money and the economy shrinks and so people spend less money, etc. it’s a death spiral. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:25:04
You know what makes me fearful for the future of crypto? The terrible economics being parroted in this thread.
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:33:39
Yes we have the FDIC which functions similarly to your FSCS, however that wasn't a thing until after the Great Depression and the system of transferring inactive accounts to the government predates the establishment of the FDIC. The US has seen an absurd number of banks fail in its history, some which were essentially suitcases in hotel rooms (the so called "Wildcat Banks" of the early 19th century). This system was put in place to avoid the evaporation of accounts as much as possible.
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:26:08
There wasn't a boom and bust cycle before the creation of the Fed duh /s

Been hodling since $100
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:27:04
They don't give it away they send it to the state government who holds it until it's claimed by the people who lost it. The system was set up back when banks failed more often and if you didn't pay attention your money really could go poof.
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:23:07
No there's one reason why deflation leads to a spiral. If your money is worth more over time you're incentivized to hold on to it, so people hoard it, they don't invest it, they spend as little as possible. This causes the economy to contract. Times are bad so people spend less money, the economy contracts further, etc etc. Economies have to grow to be healthy, if all they do is shrink you're fucked regardless of fractional reserve banking.

Because despite there being a European central bank, all EU member states have their own central bank and monetary policy which can be used to manipulate currency. They all release their own debt too (Long live the bund!)

There isn't a ton of liquidity in the Renminbi market so if you're buying or selling in large enough amounts to matter you're forced to trade with the Chinese central bank. Consequently they get to just set whatever exchange rate they want and no secondary market has sprung up to compete with them for a bunch of complicated reasons.

I've used Jon the Ripper to recover simple gpg passwords that I'd forgotten it's pretty powerful and easily tweak able. I had to convert my private block into a format that it recognized but beyond that you can use wordlists pretty simply. Plus it's open source.

Goldman has nothing to do with peasants. Its an investment bank that is notoriously secretive and they only this year launched a retail banking wing which accounts for something like 1% of their sales. These people don't even have a sign on their building thats how little they care.

If Bitcoin can't sustain the same derivatives that every other asset class does, it really undermines our claim that it is a robust asset and lends credibility to the claim that it is dramatically overvalued.

Why are you capitalizing all the letters in "fiat"? Are you suggesting it is an acronym?
