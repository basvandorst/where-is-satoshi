If you read the Bitcointalk thread we go into great detail about our verification methods using Bitcoin message signing.
This provides us with a signed proof of the bet the player wants to place, the player also gets a signed copy by us.
If there is a dispute with a player, they can request a full signed receipt from us, where we show every bet made is signed by the player with a private key generated in their browser.
Coinroll.it, or just-dice or prime dice do not currently offer this method of verification. They are free to change any bet on their database without anyone knowing. They can change the value of a secret, change the bet amount, or even remove all the rows relating to a user and claim that person never played on their site, while being able to keep any Bitcoins that were deposited.

The before mentioned Bitcoin signing methods that can prove that our service is actually probably fair and that bets can't be changed in the database behind the scenes.

Maybe so, but I'm confident at the very least the competition we provide will push more services into incorporating Bitcoin signatures into their methods, making better, fairer games for everyone.

Fair enough, but I'm currently the only site that is provably fair and off-blockchain. If you don't want to play, I don't blame you.

If you read our post on Bitcointalk, you can see the methods we use which cryptographically sign bets, ensuring we can work off-blockchain while still being able to provide a fair game.
I know it's the 20th odd gambling site, but read through our algorithms and you'll see we actually offer a fair service whereas many of the current operators do not.
We are however still unfair in the manner that there is a house edge and ultimately we will always win.
Believe it or not, I am only doing this to raise some initial funds for a start-up. I'm not in gambling for the long run, but I think if I can provide a much fairer game to the players at a lower edge that's a good thing.
