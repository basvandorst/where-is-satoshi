4000 is never a big deal. I think we won't have a big surge in months. Trade futures on BaseFEX coz it allows you to short and use leverages. Try not hold bitcoins for another six months but trade in short terms in this perfect consolidation.
I suggest to short when it goes up. Bitcoin still needs more time and lacks momentum. Shorters are safe in at least another 3 months.

Using Cobo wallet and BaseFEX wallet. the latter is an exchange but they actually charge nothing besides the necessary network fee.

consolidation is always going to be longer than you thought. Be patient. And the people you call idiots are right. I am shorting at 3970$ on BaseFEX for a quick revenue.

Agreed. Still it is not the time to go up, it's hard to tell when but I know it's not now. I only trade futures on BaseFEX right now in short terms.

I only care about the trading experience on different exchanges, obviously the high margin ratio of CME and CBOE is tough. I personally trade on **BaseFEX,** a new exchange but the operation is quite simple and huge discount on commission.

No matter how the price is gonna changed, Bitcoin futures can be a safer way to arbitrage than the spot market. From the point of view of traders, **BaseFEX is the exchange much more simple to trade on and seldom overload.**

Neither is better than BaseFEX, [

Exchanges like CME is well-regulated but the trading volume number just speaks itself, it won't attract too many traders as time goes by. 
However, exchanges like Bitmex work better for traders due to its promotion and rich product. BaseFEX as a even optimized exchange, gives more discount on commission without overloading. I personally think it's the ideal place to trade.

I don't think it will be Btc settled which is pretty bad for traders so that traders would love Bitmex more than CME. **BaseFEX, although new, is very user friendly and the best exchange I've ever tried so far.**

Bakkt is not even better than BaseFEX, [

It's almost a year or so since CME's launch, and price keeps going down. I don't know exactly how CME has something to do with the price down trend, but CME is definitely not the perfect exchange to trade Bitcoin futures since the hurdle is too high. 
A new exchange, BaseFEX is pretty easy to execute orders and gives lots of commission discount.

CME is well-regulated but a user friendly place to trade. As far as I know, **BaseFEX, though new, is quite smooth exchange, you'd better have a try.** [**
