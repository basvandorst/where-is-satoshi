If you are using iOS, I would suggest greenaddress, because they have segwit and custom fees.

It has never been about new altcoins (Bcrash and S2shit). It is about increasing fee on BTC network. When temporarily minning BCH or B2X, BTC becomes slow and fee explodes. Now they don’t need spend money on spam. They can earn money minning shitcoin while BTC fees drive up.

I will never give my bitcoin to any government. Only dolar shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:46:36
Exactly the same for your home, your car and everything else. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:35:37
China will learn that bitcoin work for freedom and for people. Bitcoin doesnt give a shit for governments.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:29:23
No. Same security. Same BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:23:57
Well...Doge has more txs than bcash. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:26:23
Please, exchange your work for your ideal money. I will exchange mine for bitcoins. And lets the people choose.

Sorry, dude. This is consolidation. Batching is the oposite. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:08:24
You mispelled something, for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:55:54
Everytime bitcoin network becomes slow due to bcrash, the bitcoin fee explodes.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:23:42
Government accepting bitcoins is a good news. But I will never give my bitcoins to them.

Despit it is inspiring, graphs talk about the past; not about the future.

There is no reason for using legacy. Choose segwt

Arent you afraid about hardware wallets eventually leak your private keys to the developers?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:56:11
It has never been about new altcoins (Bcrash and S2shit). It is about increasing fee on BTC network. When temporarily minning BCH or B2X, BTC becomes slow and fee explodes. Now they don’t need spend money on spam. They can earn money minning shitcoin while BTC fees drive up. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:53:52
Great answer. Thank u
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:25:55
I think u dont understand how miners work. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:28:02
We. The people. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:46:19
This is huge!
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:26:05
If Segwit2x adopters want segwit plus 2MB blocks each 10 minutes, they already have LTC. It's not about code; It's about core. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:51:08
If u have 10 million usd (144 blocks x 12,5 btc x 5500 usd) u can claim the btc name for your shitcoin on coinbase and gemini. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:08:18
Segwit. Lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:39:33
Well. USA has started as a small government with the best check and balances. You can check them now. FED, FDA, SEC, gold confiscation, war on drugs and so on. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:44:57
Bitcoin is the first human asset ruled by consensus; instead force.

Taxis drivers say the samething about uber. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:37:10
It is not a free market. Coinbase users cant dump bch until january. So, during the next fork, b2x and bch will be stealing hashrate from btc and we cant fairly dump them. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:09:14
I would sugest you a bitcoinheat.

Is Somalia libertarian? It is socialist! 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:58:30
If u offer more money to miners than they would earn from minning btc, they will mine your coin. Coinbase and gemini have told if u have more pow, u deserve btc brand name. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:19:52
We r arguing because u didnt understand yet. So, u will lose and learn.

I have seen somewhere the energy used to keep bitcoin safe is very small, compared to the energy used to keep safe the same ammount of cash in banks. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:04:08
Yes. This link shows the number of outputs[Number of outputs]( 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:56:45
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:15:28
Really?! They already have Bcrash with high transaction throughput
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:28:30
U are confusing hashrate with costs and earnings. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:03:43
You should shut up if you dont understand future markets and arbitrage. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:07:55
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:57:51
I agree with you. But coinbase and gemini shouldn’t allow this cash attack on btc name. 10 million is very cheap for a government. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:48:32
Short squeeze 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:32:36
Poloniex also has not segwit available. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:35:28
I should not use Gemini. They still dont have segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:34:38
There is only one moral compromise. Miners should serve the users -- we, the people. And they are been paid for it. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:47:41
One word: HALVING.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:26:42
If you think people will wait until there to take an action, you are wrong.
