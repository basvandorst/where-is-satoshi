What a shit show. Sold at 16K for a nice profit. Can't complain.

Same situation and I'm peeved.

I sent my Bitcoin Cash from GDAX to Binance Tuesday at 9PM and there are still ZERO confirmations. I'm losing money just waiting. Is this the fault of Coinbase or just extremely slow hash rate?

That $314 figure seems right after the price correction on Coinbase. At least you've received yours and it gives me hope that soon mine will go through.
Edit: just saw you still don't have it...F

Has anyone tried sending Bcash from GDAX to Binance? I sent it an hour ago and nothing is showing up in my history on Binance.

I tried selling before coinbase went down. I was in class on my iPhone at 19K, but it was super laggy. And I didn't sell all of my btc. That would be tragic.

You could, but there's no guarantee of arbitrage because of confirmation times. I've been waiting for my Bcash transfer for 20 hours now and 0 confirmations.

I tried transferring my Bcash from gdax to Binance at 9PM on Tuesday and there are still 0 confirmations.

I tried transferring my Bcash to Binance from GDAX last night at 9PM and there are still no confirmations. Did I fuck up or what?

If only they would respond to my 2 month old support ticket.
