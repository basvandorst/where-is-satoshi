I was one of those guys who didn't just hold on, I bought more when it dipped down low! I think if you're going to hold, you need to live by that strategy. The idea of holding is that in the long term it will be worth much more and that the dips are nothing to be worried about. If you go by this logic then it's essential to buy whenever it dips, it's like a 20% off sale! I'm happy I made that gamble right now.

Does someone have a good article or a video to recommend that would help getting others up to speed on this issue? As a hodler I don't spend much time and energy getting up to speed with most bitcoin issues or debates but this one seem's important and it is quite unclear for someone like me who is not very concerned about short term issues. 
 
This is not coming from a new user, but more of a hodler that believes Bitcoin is a technology of the future which is here to stay. Many people just don't go too technical, but I feel like this is important. Thanks

There is a lot of schilling happening in bitcoin forums like this one. Many people want to see bitcoin fail and are trying to smear the image of bitcoin and its supporters. Wehave to be aware of this and avoid the nonsense they are pushing at us. This forum is surprisingly similar to r/conspiracy when it comes to waacky shit being promoted. It probably comes from a barage of alt coins trying to disrupt bitcoins progression by paying social media influencer companies. Probably also some governments and some other competing investment funds. 
Sounds crazy but there is a lot of evidence out there and I refuse to believe that a technology this complex is adobted primarily by fanatics and nutjobs like we see here.

I think this is a good strategy for us Hodlers if we want to encourage bitcoin to become a functioning currency. We have to lead by example and this is a good way to do it. If we don't spend then there will never be enough incentive for merchants to do business in BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:05:16
I would not bet on consumerism taking a dive unless we hit a major economic crash. But then we will have to see how BTC will act in that scenario.

Interesting... Instead if hodling, they're holding their cocks!

LOL! I'm hired with a paycheck everytime. I never received a dime from advertising... my clients pay me for the production of their videos. Weather they get money from users or advertisers... I don't care. 
As a content creator I hate the idea of having my viewers questioning the worth of every second they are watching. I like simplified payment methods like Netflix. That is a good formula that removes advertisements and I'm all for it! 
Lost soul... wtf lol. I'm sorry but to borrow your own words "man, take it easy!"
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:07:40
Not really though, the content you payed for is already created and you don't even know if you like it yet. What happens if you watch it, only to find out it was a waste of your time... and now money! We watch shows and know what to expect (in general) when we watch a new episode. With the web people are glad they don't have to pay because each new video is a new risk. I'm sorry I just don't see this working. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 14:52:38
I don't just want to store money. I want it to grow. I don't trust that gold value will go up like I do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:26:49
And so that could make bitcoin value drop drastically if they get crushed?

Why is there so much childish hate in this sub? I don't get why such a positive technology atracts so many abnoxious people to the conversation. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:46:53
Can you not read? I want my viewers experience to be optimal so they can appreciate the work as much as possible. That means if I'm doing web there should be no commercial in the middle and no distracting back thought like how much the video is going to cost... each and every second spent watching the thing. A preroll add allows for people to get payed for that content and once it is closed it does not distract from the viewer experience at all. 
Thanks for spewing your shit. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:18:46
sorry but that is not a very good example. For your example to work, your competitor would have had to sell Your doughnuts... for free.
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:01:52
I'm sorry but I disagree. Maybe you torrent because you want to avoid commercials, but thats not at all why most people torrent. Most people torrent because it's the only way they can afford content from all the different paying services. People in general don't have enough money for AMC, HBO, full tv package, movies etc. People torrent because they are able to get the content they apreciate, due to the huge availability and variety internet makes possible. 
People also like flexibility, they like being able to watch what they want when they want. That means not having to change their schedule to watch a tv show at a time the network choses. The internet already is the solution to this and this is why netflix, torrenting and youtube is so popular. 
I'm a filmmaker myself and I can't imagine spoiling my public's viewing experience with the thought of an increasing pricetag in the back of their mind. An advertisement before the video is the least of my problem, it goes away after 5 seconds and then people can watch my videos without any distractions. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 15:53:16
Sooo... what happens if they get the patent? We all know the patent industry is garbage and goldman has enough money to bribe them. In theory, could they sue bitcoin out of existance and take over with their own digital currency?
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:57:16
No thanks... its great for the content creators but it's delusional to think that people would prefer paying extra to avoid commercials. People already have way to many things they have to pay for and they don't feel like the ads even work on them so basically every video watched is percieved as free.

Alright, can anybody ELI5 this lightning Network thing for a lot of us here including me. Basically what does it do, how does it work, advantages, disadvantages?
There are a lot of acronyms used in the sub, it gets hard to follow sometimes with the complexity of the subject.

I'm fairly certain my money is locked up at the moment in an account where the bank manages investments with my money. I know the term in french but can't find it in english. 
I like the thought of having more than one security and it seems like the trezor is exactly that.

So your saying if I pirate the titanic I'm really just downloading a film about a disney cruise ship that hits a rock in the atlantic?

Wtf are you even talking about? You think I don't recognise slavery? My girlfriend is black, I just went to Rwanda and Haiti this year and had direct interaction with people who's lives were directly affected by slavery. I know full well that he is describing slavery, I'm saying this system has solutions to it.

I like the irony of it!

Thanks for the reply, I'm really glad people are taking interest or have been taking interest. Implementation is by far the hardest step. Unfortunately I think it would take a world war or imminant threat of one as the world stands today. But maybe we can change that. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 18:08:53
Were talking about world political structures here, shit needs to be "planny". Anything else at this large of a scale would just be anarchy!
@_date: 2016-10-21 00:14:37
I do want to further refine my theory and text and the best way to do so is to test it logically. Whats your question here exactly? Is it how we deal with mass unemployent due to millitary being defunded? 
If so it doesn't really matter because the country would have enough resources to let everyone just live and do nothing for a year. Of course they would lose a big piece of the pie next year if they were this un productive, but it does not create chaos.

Wait what?... Free market encourages corruption and crushing of competition. Free market does not have an incentive for cooperation and peace, only for profit and market control.

Numbers can be re adjusted after the first year. Large falsification of numbers shows bad intent and will affect next years score. 
Edit** I dont see why I'm getting downvoted for explaining how this would work. Could you please just make your points if you disagree instead of downvoting and not contributing to tje convo?

And i just described how it would not happen you dweeb. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:35:41
The people you bring over after the budget is determined are just more mouths to feed. If you wanted to do this it would have to be in the last weeks before the new budget and if you got caught (any significant amount would get you caught) then you would recieve heavy sanctions for human trafficking.

Go look at the trend since 2004. It's clearly rising, maybe at a pace slower than we would like but it is rising.

What is to stop one nation within your system from accumulating more resources to attack a neighbooring nation if they can gain reaources for themselves? Nothing. Theres no consequence if they don't "play fair" and no incentive to cooperate. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:17:18
I think if we do see a drpp soon it will be very short lived and followed by a huge rise once again. A tonne of people are excited by the seep curve and want to buy more at a lower cost. There is more excirement thsn ever which is great. At this point, unless there is some horrible news it seems like bitcoin is stsrting to take off.

Im not proposing universal income... Any lazy society would recieve a smaller piece of the pie. There is an incentive for every member of society to be used at their full pottential to make advances and secure a better budget for the nation.
