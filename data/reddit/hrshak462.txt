Crazy how it just clicked to me why coinbase is probably waiting until January to give out the BCH.  It gives everyone, including the govt. a year to figure it out.
I just feel bad for all the people I gave btc to that just hodled.  Now they owe taxes because of me.  I guess I will just tell them to give it back if they don't want the hassle.

At this point bitcoin could play a part in all this, but only to the extent of accepting it from customers and paying vendors.
It all depends on how close Bitpay, for instance, will get to the pot industry.  Will they not deal with a bag or container supplier that sells to dispensaries?  Will they not have an electric company as a customer that provides electric to growers?  Will they not deal with a landlord that rents to the pot industry?  Will coinbase not sell bitcoin to me if I by pot with it? (probably) 
So dispensary accepts bitcoin and uses it to pay some of their bills.  Maybe they get flush with bitcoin and have to stop accepting it for periods of time.  Obviously they need cash to pay their taxes, but there are many expenses that they may theoretically be able to pay in bitcoin.
None of this can happen until bitcoin is ~~anonymous~~ fungible though.
edit *fungible

Every person you write a check to gets to see your account number and bank/routing number.  It is a very weird system.
The only real safeguard is that they can see where the money goes and send it back if it is fraud.  Like someone said, the system is reactive not preventative.
Some one tried to pay their cellphone bill from my work bank account.  It may have even been a typo on someone's part.  The only reason it was prevented was because we have a service that we pay the bank for that only lets authorized companies debit from our account.  If we didn't have that then it would have been a headache to retrieve the money.  Most individual accounts would not have this service.
edit: some companies will not debit from your account unless you verify you own the account by confirming two small debits.  Most of us know this.  I guess Sprint and many others don't do this.

I do wish bitpay and coinbase made it easier for people to basically work for them by recruiting merchants.  I feel like the information on their sites is a bit limited.

Don't listen to the naysayers.  If $60 a month is all you can afford to put away, then you need a hail mary.

I was going to throw the word "Pheeva" in here, but I can't really recommend it anymore.  I had it running on my wife's iphone.  It was simple and featureless but it worked and you could scan QR codes.  I knew it would eventually ask to pay for a membership, but I could never find information on price or anything.
Now when we try to open it we get a message that the membership has expired.  It asks for a credit card number(no bitcoin accepted?) but it doesn't even tell you how much will be charged.  Why would I enter my credit card when I have no idea how much might be charged?  I have heard rumors of $10 but I can't find anything concrete.

Not necessarily.  If I had a business there is no way I would jump right on to using CB or BP as a processor until it got busy with bitcoins.  
The owner must know how to use them so he/she can just put "cash in the register" for the customer for now right?  Generate a new address as each one is used.  If it gets real then you can go legit.  I see no issue with starting slow and "clumsy".
Edit: If every Bitcoin user owned a business, we would be mainstream by now.  Instead we just try to talk  business owners in to taking our form of payment.  Truth is that they don't have time to research it like people like I do.

Getting rid of the physical awkwardness is key.  My regular lunch place has a big crack in their ipad cause someone dropped it.  That is from them having to hand it off to customers to sign on it when they use credit/debit cards which cost the old man 2.75%.  (I heard him mention this to someone once and I briefly told him about bitcoin/bitpay.  He listened and took notes but you know how it is.  I try to pay him in cash when I can)
Why doesn't bitpay give something like this to their customers for free?  Probably working on it I guess.  You are hired.  
I'm sending some bittys your way.
an btw as usual I checked out blockchain.info out of curiosity to see if you are getting any donations.  I don't even look at the dates.  I just look at the number of confirmations to see about how old the transactions are.

With my method you just have to track money/goods in/out.  The IRS way is ridiculous.  My way is honest and works in the long run.

Yeah, your available instant buy will slowly build back up to $1000 over the next full week.  By Monday you could maybe buy another $700 worth or so (estimate).
Now don't listen to me but now might not be the worst time if you want to buy more and trust that they will deliver them to you in five days or so at today's price.  That's the tough part with Coinbase.

I am from the US(up over) so take that in to consideration.  
If I were a merchant i would not consider accepting bitcoin until I held some bitcoin myself.  Get a case of beers worth of bitcoin in your own hands and then you will know how to accept it for your business.
If you can't do that then....
Put up a sign that says you are considering accepting bitcoin first.  Potential bitcoin customers will then help you get started.  If nobody helps you, then you don't need to accept bitcoin.

I was at a bar that takes bitcoin in Philly the other day.  I asked if the manager could come out so I could talk about it and offer him some stickers.  The server was a bit puzzled about why I wanted to talk to him and asked me twice if I worked for Bitcoin.  I said no and that nobody works for Bitcoin because it is not a company.  
I believe I stand corrected in a way.  Keep up the good work everyone.  Great post!

If Bitcoin as money becomes widely used, along with it will come similar fees to what we have now.  The difference is that one can choose to bypass those fees when dealing with a trusted party such as sending money to a relative or a reputable business.  It gives the user more choices and more freedom.
That is just the currency part of it of course.  I don't see how anyone can say that a trusted public ledger for tons of other uses is a bad thing.

This is why I never understand why people say "don't ask reddit questions, you should talk to a tax profesional."  People on reddit know more about Bitcoin than 99% of tax professionals out there.

Of course don't listen completely to me.  You should really talk to other reddit Bitcoin professionals.

Here is how I think you buy bitcoins with a credit card on coinbase.  You link a bank account and you back it up with a credit card.  You make a purchase and make sure your bank account doesn't have enough money in it.  Then it defaults to your credit card.
In other words, you don't do it.
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:40:27
Very nice!  I hope this is also considered.
Alright so they have signs in the window saying "bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE" right? I think there should be another sign available to merchants.
"WE ARE CONSIDERING ACCEPTING bitcoin HERE".
If I was a merchant I would hang up that sign first. You know that any potential bitcoin paying customers would tell you they would pay with bitcoin as they pay you with their costly credit/debit card. Maybe nobody ever mentions it and you go about your business and don't bother with it. Maybe you get a bunch of feedback and realize it might be worth it.
If Coinbase and Bitpay are cold calling merchants or hitting the streets, I really think they should have those signs ready to distribute.
(Sorry if you have seen this post before. I might sparingly put it in appropriate threads until I see the sign somewhere.)
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:10:37

I am not 100% on this but here it goes.  I think you can tell your bank that it was an unauthorized transaction and they will reverse it.  Then Coinbase will go after you for the money though.
If they didn't go after the money then people could pull this scam on them all the time by "hacking" their own account.

* Sell $500 BTC (-$500)
* Spend BTC and get $100 worth of goods and services (-$400)
* Overall I am in the hole $400
* No taxes to be paid and I start the next year with a balance of -$400
* Year two
* Purchase $1000 of BTC (-$1400)
* Sell $2000 BTC ($600)
* Spend BTC and get $1000 worth of goods and services ($1600)
* Pay Cap Gains tax on the $1600 that I am ahead.  Call it long term because I had no gains last year.  If I had gains last year as well then I would have called them short term.

I can't stress this enough. You have to have a separate bank account to use with coinbase. Preferably a credit union. Only have enough money in there that you want to use to buy bitcoins.also try to back it up with a Visa Card with the lowest limit possible.

Paper wallet&gt;Blockchain.info web wallet&gt;Pheeva Iphone Hot Wallet&gt;Don't keep more than $20 in there until we know what we have here
It works but I am not ready to recommend the Pheeva wallet yet.  There will be a fee to be in the co-op and I'm not sure what that will be yet.  If it is $10 per year and it is the only iphone option, then I think it is worth it.  It is super easy and ready for new users but the way it gets installed is not so easy.  You sign up and get an email and install it from a link in the email.
edit: I don't have an iphone but I installed pheeva on the iphone of someone I know.  I can answer some questions.
edit2: I mean this really is a problem for new users.  Noobs already think they have to "join" Bitcoin or think I am trying to sell them something.  Now iphone users really do have to "join" something to play and they do have to pay something.  That is why I would not push Pheeva on a noob yet.  It's hard enough to get new people interested without creeping them out which this might.

13 cents
I got in the game on October 27, 2013(Norwegian dude story).  The first thing I did was register for Gox on Halloween.  It took three weeks to get verified.  By then I had already known for two weeks that Gox was not safe.  My limited amount of play money bitcoins were always in and out of there quickly.  Last bitcoin was withdrawn on January 17th and never looked back.
I'm so sorry for those that lost out.  It was probably a lot of people that used them for years I imagine.  I feel like denial and laziness might have played a part in that.

$1,000 worth, lol, I know
Of course I know what you are saying, but that is the "old" realistically impossible way of tracking bitcoin.  I am trying to live in a dreamland of simplification.
My way doesn't care if you are holding any bitcoins because they are really worthless until they are sold or spent.  If I was gaining interest on them while holding then yes, they have value I guess.  That time could come or maybe it is already out there.  If so then there is an argument for having to track number of bitcoins and value at time of each taxable event.
The whole US tax code needs to be simplified so bad.  Maybe it could start with bitcoin?  Dreamland I know.

I was talking about $60 a month for "a few years" at most while we see where this goes, as I mentioned.  Do you think he is going to keep at it for 17 years if Bitcoin stays at $600 for that time period?
So what future value (17 years from now) is he giving up by throwing $60 a month at it for two years?  At 8% I say $6,000 at most.  Yes it would be better to have $6,000 than nothing, but it really won't make the difference between much at all.
I see where you misunderstood my math, but I hope I cleared it up.  I didn't advise this path, I just said that yes, if nothing changes for him, this may be his only hope.  Would spending it on lottery tickets be a better shot?  That's a tough call.

This is about Pheeva the bitcoin wallet for iphones.  I have been testing it on someone I knows iphone.  As far as I can tell it doesn't have an address book or transaction history but it works.  You shouldn't keep real money on it and they don't expect you to.  Walking around money as they say.
If it ends up costing 10 bucks a year or something to be part of the co-op and it is the only bitcoin wallet "available" for iphone, then I would say that might be worth it.
Others say use coinpunk or blockchain.info web wallet but I'm pretty sure they are not as easy to use as this.  I would like to see this get improved and get legs.

It has happened to me twice.  Once it took an hour and once it took about two hours.  It wasn't an issue for me with those particular transactions fortunately.  
I go to a bar that takes bitcoin and uses Coinbase as their processor.  I don't even use my Coinbase wallet there just in case.  It probably would no doubt be fine because they happen to use CB, but I'm not chancing it when I can just use Mycellium wallet.

I read some replies in this thread and installed the blockchain app on my wife's yphone (iphone).  I tried to get her to pull up a QR code so I could send her 5$ worth of BTC.  I as the sender couldn't determine the amount of the request.  Her as the receiver couldn't request a converted amount of BTC(she had to put in .0014352 or whatever).  Maybe we didn't didn't enough of a chance?  She uninstalled it and got mad at me.

TL;DR Banks need to pick a side, have answers ready and stand by their decision.
I really don't know how I can currently suggest that any business accept bitcoins.  Imagine running a small sandwich shop and banking with Firstrust for many years.  Then some customers bring up bitcoin to you and suggest coinbase merchant services.  Next thing you know you either have to lose the bitcoin or lose your bank.  Maybe you don't even get an option and they just shut you down.
I did suggest bitcoin to a shop owner a few weeks ago when it came up in conversation as he grumbled over debit/credit cards fees.  He already had the tablet with the attachment to run the cards(whatever that system is called).  I figured it wouldn't be too much to add bitcoin integration to his system.  I mentioned bitpay to him but I don't think he gave it much thought.  Well I don't think I can suggest bitcoin to businesses anymore until this all settles out.  I don't want to cause them problems.  btw, I try to pay him cash when I come in now.
Even talking to friends that seem interested is a chore now.  I say to them, "wait you're not with Bank of America or Capital One 360/ING are you?"  Now I have to mention Firstrust along with them.  This is kind of a turn off for people, I've seen it.
I want to start going around to banks to feel them out, but I guarantee I will get different answers from different people within the same building.  Ninety percent of bank employees probably won't even know what I'm talking about.  "Hey can I see your list of banned ACH vendors?"  I'm sure that will go over well.
I'm expecting someone from my bank to call me tomorrow.  I just hope they know what they are talking about.  I do think they made a mistake by putting it in writing.  As others have found out, just closing accounts with no explanation is probably the safest move for banks scared of bitcoin at this time.

Good point yes, but my splitting of the checks point still stands.  I deal with it every Friday.  I go out to lunch with four or five people and people rarely have cash anymore.  Two or three of them stop at the atm and get 20s.  They pay the atm fee which is $2-$3.  Not bad if they withdrawal $100, but I think they usually take out $20-$40.  That seems like a high percentage to pay to get your money.
Then the check comes and we split it evenly and it is usually 15-18/person.  I am the one that handles it and I need to make it work.  
Blah blah blah, digital $ could make it easier for me.
edit: and today is different than most days because hardly anyone is here(holiday time).  It worked out that one person from my usual group is here.

One option, and I hope this is cool cause it's what I do....buy on coinbase, move BTC to Gox if you want to play around with trading, move BTC back to coinbase to withdraw.
Make sure you are verified on Gox too though.  It is currently unclear whether you can move BTC out if you aren't verified.  It took me 3-4 weeks to get verified, but it could be shorter now.

I say you are correct.  I don't get it when people say it doesn't work because the Gox price is generally higher.  Who cares?
Buy 1BTC on coinbase.
Move it to Gox.
Get lucky and trade it into 1.25BTC (paying some trading fees along the way of course)
Move it back to coinbase.
How is this not coming out ahead?
The problem is when you start by moving cash to Gox and buy coins and then move them to coinbase.  That is when it's not making sense.

Is it possible that you double entered your card in their system?  They are trying to verify it twice?  You have four amounts.  I believe that to be six different combinations you could try entering.  ab,ac,ad,bc,bd,cd, that is if they let you try to verify more than once or twice before rejecting.
Why would your $109 purchase be connected to the credit card?  Didn't that come from your bank account?
guessing here.

Um, it's the room with the best lighting?
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:39:49
I can respect that but uhhhhhhhh no.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:42:38
A coworker of mine just mentioned that she thought $1,200 was to much for a coin and she wouldn't think about it.  She didn't realize that you could buy fractions of a BTC.  With a name like "coin" it is understandable that people think you need to buy a whole BTC.

hmmm, I can't scan the qr code at the beginning or end.
correction: Mycelium app won't scan it but Coinbase app will

I guess that's a good point.  They are unsure at this time and need to play it safe I guess.  Maybe they should have called me about opening a business account?
I will surely ask them about it.  I'm not going to go in all hot headed about it, that's for sure.

@_date: 2013-12-10 05:35:05
This is not the only bank I deal with so I could walk away from them in a minute which is good.  That said, I guess it would be a good idea to keep your bitcoin banking separate from your main banking just in case.  
Not that I'm telling people what to do with their money like one of my banks does!

Haha, I know it was a stretch, but it was just a general remark about how you can now get healthcare in the US when you have a pre-existing condition.  It's like not having car insurance and then purchasing it only after you get in a car accident and expecting it to cover the loss.

Here is how it went down.  I first tried to take a picture on a table.  The pics just weren't coming out bright enough.  I then took it in the well lit bathroom to take a pic on the counter.  Then I turned around and saw the toilet and thought, this fits.

Yes yes yes.  I dont have time to explain.  Many people cant grasp it.
Edit: I just wish coinbase didnt lower their instant buy limit.  I do understand but, I was spending some real coin if I could replace it right away.  and I know this isn't a coinbase support forum.
Another edit... people have to eat!

I believe in BTC but this is well put.  Third parties will come in and solve BTC problems for 3-5%.  Sound familiar?  
BTC could still be good for trusted parties to exchange dough though,  like if someone wants to send wealth back to their brother in another country right?   I got nothing.  Gotta think here.

@_date: 2013-11-15 04:02:45
woohoo!  I will now look into tipping and would tip you if I wasn't so noob
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:22:06
I feel like yes it is allowed.  Businesses in the US can refuse to serve any customer as long as they refuse any customer that does the same thing.  I can refuse to serve people that wear green shirts as long as I refuse all people that wear green shirts.  That said, there are protected classes like blacks, women, etc.  You can't discriminate like that.  Don't quote me but I think that's what's up. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:14:00
On it.  Will research.  I guess their CNBC ads just cater to the big guns.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:05:31
I see what you are saying.  Good points.

@_date: 2013-12-10 06:57:30
I will pass that on if it comes to that.  I really like the way you think.  I'm going to be watching you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:17:49
Yeah you would think it makes sense but it seems like you are losing money.  Let's say I want to spend $100 at Amazon.  Why not just spend $100 on BTC and then buy a gyft card?  Well Gyft uses bitpay's current rate which is always lower that the price you can buy BTC for.
At this moment I could buy 1 BTC at bitstamp for $589 and use that to get a gyft card for $493?  Umm, no.  At least not at this moment.
edit: even last week when things weren't so nuts I looked in to it.  I could of got a $85 dollar Amazon gyft card for $100.  Yeah you get 3%/$3 back but it still didn't make sense.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:47:59
That's the first thought that came to my mind.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:26:36

No source, just gut.

Well if nothing else this tweet by them reminded me to buy more  beertender tubes for my beertender.  Too bad I usually get Newcastle keg cans for it though suckers!
edit: of course they are probably the same company now right?  guess I'm the sucker now.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:49:48
Good point.  Been there done that and will be doing again and again.  Gotta love the Gyft.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:56:43
Instant buy might only be 10btc/week at full level 2

At the moment, maybe.  Tomorrow, who knows.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:11:28
Funny thing.  I have too many banks already (not that I have much money in any of them).  I was actually looking to consolidate so this kind of works and makes the decision easier.
Unless the banks talk to each other and I get blacklisted or something!  Think about it.
Edit: yeah so for everyone....No bank is really going to miss my business if you know what I mean

@_date: 2013-12-12 01:08:48
So I don't think that anyone is reading this thread anymore, but I will still post here.  If anything big happens I will post a new thread.
I talked to a women at my bank.  I showed her the letter I received.  She acknowledged that she was aware that the letter had been sent out.  She looked up my account and read something on her screen for about four minutes.  She started a reply, but then paused and continued to read for another minute.  It was odd and she was obviously uncomfortable.  She then said, "Coinbase is an international exchange that deals in the digital currency bitcoin which has been used for money laundering.  We do not allow transactions through their company".  I then replied, "well of the course the American dollar has never been used for money laundering," to which I received no reply.
I told her that I do not have any more transactions in process and I do not want my account to close.  She then called somebody and left them a voicemail relaying this information.  She told me that she would call me back when she got a reply from whoever that was.
I got the call back today and she confirmed that my account would not be closed.  It seemed like they were willing to give a lot of leeway on this issue.  I have a feeling it was just an empty threat.
All I can/will say at this time is that this is not over.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:16:10
Well I guess Snoop and Heiney think we are a joke.  Boycott weed and beer!  Alright, let's not go crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:50:29
Yeah surprised to see very little(none actually).  People are afraid to admit they in to it for fear of looking the fool in front or their real "friends".  It is risky I suppose.  Still very new to humans.
edit: and I have asked a few of my tech savvy friends and they did not know about it.  virgin territory 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:46:38
That is exactly right about the hands.  Someone I know has a theory that they will try to keep it down until they can get in properly.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:23:37
He certainly doesn't want to make it appear that he has looked in to the matter.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:05:42
Is it preferred to print it on a B&amp;W laser jet printer though?  I know it's not as pretty.  Are there color laser jets?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:34:12
like I said to someone else, I can respect skepticism.  I could post a pic of the envelope but wouldn't prove much.  Why fake it though?  Street cred?(I just like saying street cred)
I don't wanna scare people off the bitcoin or the bank that has treated me good.  It's more of a PSA for r/bitcoin.

If it was your first time going there I would say you are a dummy.  Since you are(were) a regular, you would think they might have been curious and taken a chance on this "worthless piece of paper."  Then next time they might say to you, thanks but no thanks, real money only.  Or maybe they would beg for more bitcoin, who knows. 
edit: Also this makes me wonder what they would have done if you said you were short of a tip and would get them next time.  People do this all the time at their regular establishments.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:09:12
Coinbase better start serving customers outside of the US or they are going out of business.
First American Bank,
Chase(maybe just business accounts?),
Bank of America,
Capital One 360(ING Direct)
That's what I have so far.

I like coinbase.  No, I love.  
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:06:36
Gotcha.  Well that just won't make sense for this application yet.  I guess they will adjust and work it out.
edit: and I am just so confused(uninformed) and will stop here.  Apple gets a % when people buy from amazon, trade stocks with etrade, etc?  Maybe they don't have "apps" and people go through browsers for this stuff?  I need to look in to this further.  Thanks for the dialogue.  I do get what you are saying.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:42:07
Well people could sell tomorrow and guarantee it won't hit their bank til 2014.  Could begin now right?

Since the date on this letter I have had a couple transactions go through.  I also have one I have yet to see, but I expect to see it go through tomorrow.
I literally just got this out of the mailbox (haven't checked it in a few days) so I'm kind of steaming right now and not sure what my next move will be.

No no no no.  They are banned.  Plus they play joke and pee pee in our coke.  Please don't forgive.  I remember your post and it made me mad.  
edit: and like I said in the original post, since you gave them plenty of business in the past with $$$$ they can suck it.

I was unaware I had a "undying devotion to bitcoin." And you better capitalize Bitcoin next time!  Joking in case you get jokes. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:22:17
and for the record...they have treated me fine for 12 years and maybe I should have talked to them first before posting this, but I think I can assume they know what they are doing so this is a PSA I guess(for the six of you that might be with my bank).
Similarly, when people I know consider buying Bitcoin I say, "you're not with Bank of America right, because I hear they are closing accounts."

I see nothing wrong with keeping a small portion of your coins on coinbase for spending purposes though.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:50:20
I feel like that is pretty common for things like this.   Otherwise you could just start paying for support when something breaks down.  Like obamacare.
