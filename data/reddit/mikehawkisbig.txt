How much is taxes? When converting bitcoin to USD and claiming capital gains? I honestly have no idea? I was guessing around 45%?

Pretty crazy gamble, but my question is... why? If he was going to turn around and pay back is debt he'll gain very little after taxes? It's not like his bank will accept Bitcoin as payment.

The most clueless has the loudest voices and the simple minded will follow. This is the political way unfortunately. These people should hire experts to help them understand what they are trying to oppress.

This is me being a little naive, but at a 10,000 foot view, is this all about taxes? With something like a cryptocurrency, if it becomes mainstream and over takes cash, how hard would it be to collect taxes on it? How hard would it be for the government to come after someone to prove cryptocurrency taxable profit? Could cryptocurrency be a threat to federal and state taxes?
I'm truly clueless on this and probably need to do some reading, but I thought I'd ask.

Actually the second amendment folks (obviously I can't speak for all of them) actually like the idea of not being controlled by the government so tightly that freedom is just a word and not an action taken by our government. ALL the 2A pro people I know want a form of gun control and understand the media is what twists and manipulates the public into believing we are some inbreed hateful nazi supporting goon, when most are family men/women who live like everyone else. I guess what I'm saying is, you would be surprised how many 2A supporters are already in the crypto game.... rant complete, lol!
