This is not a lambo??????
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:14
On the device. Due to the way it's engineered, doesn't matter if the computer or browser is compromised. The wallet is safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:14:58
How tf do you donate to yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:15:44
CoinJar are legit, they'll sort it eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:20:39
Gdax as official metric
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:27:32
But it feels so empty without me
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:05:39
I really hope this comes soon!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:16
Then it's not a donation. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:10:25
!RemindMe 1 year

@_date: 2017-12-19 05:09:34
When 1 btc = 1 lambo 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:54:30
Not for that price lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:14:58
Depends what one you want but I'd like to put half a million away for a good one!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:26:27
Do ethereum video quickly pls!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:02:52
I fucking love this so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:06:05
What he meant to say was he will never love his job as much as he loves that man. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:57:28
This guy invests. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:16:25
There is zero chance of getting the transaction through with $1 fee ATM tbh
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:43
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:15:32
Whenever 1BTC = cost of a Lamborghini Aventador. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:54:26
Also interested in this if someone knows of any festive paper wallet generators for segwit
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:30
$1k off! Limited time offer!
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:19:16
I hope this becomes the new moon meme
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:40:39
I can't quite buy a lambo with that?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:18:30
Set it up cuz
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:19:35
Luck is always going to be a largely determining factor. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:22
Now past 9700!
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:41:03
It already went to 9877 :(
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:39:52
  Dollar-cost averaging, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:13
Buy low, don't sell
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:28:51
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:26:53
The whole idea is to make people feel better about making the investment.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:12:21
Pretty crazy how you can't even buy a full coin in 24 hours anymore because it's gone over 10k
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:50:46
IMO ram as much of it in as you can. You're young and if you lose it all you can rebuild. It's not like you have a family or dependants to support. I'm 22 and have a very large chunk of my net worth in BTC. It's a punt but if I lose it's whatever?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:21:44
It "crashed" 900 USD. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:36:22
I'm in
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:26:12
Grows at the same rate, isn't exponential because your total no. BTC remains the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:55:22
It'll be a good day when we see those figures next to a dollar sign. :')
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:16:46
Obviously buy a lambo
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:17:36
Is this the surge we've been waiting for?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:16:09
Not a bad commission at all!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:20
Lmao I'll give you 10:1 bro
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:29
Well past 11k now too!
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:54:42
That will make it tough to get to 10k no? And I bet there's an even bigger 10k wall...
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:42:48
Yeah, that's my point. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:48:13
Rly? Why lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:19:09
Pretty bonkers since we just hit 9k yesterday...
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:29:45
$30 to go, not tired of winning yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:27:31
Lol Sif you'd go alts. Hodl btc. /thread
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:08:12
Ignition Casino
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:53:46
You're absolutely bonkers for selling all your BTC OP. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:41:46
Just leave your keys in the will and explain how to use em? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:48:36
Yes, very simple. I'd buy asap before we get back to another ATH. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:13:36
It's really not that hard. Just buy and forget about it til you can buy a lambo...
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:07:25
Lol this is nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:22:23
It's an acronym. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:18:32
Yeah pretty much already exists in the form Bitcoin currently takes. When you buy BTC, you don't have to buy a full coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:55:57
Lol these people are so pedantic. 99.999999% chance at least you're safe. People don't understand how difficult it is for malware to infect you and even then that your key will be stolen. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:24:33
5200 and climbing!?
