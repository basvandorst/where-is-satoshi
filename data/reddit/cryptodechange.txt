Is lightning less practical for large transactions? If so, Lightning wallets should hopefully be smart enough to put big transaction on the main chain, right?

Regarding the 'readiness' of services and Segwit, have they not deployed it because Bitcoin Core hasn't included it in their production release yet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:56
As a heads up, Electrum uses bech32 for segwit (address prefix bc1) which is incompatible with many wallets as of yet, at least with receiving coins

According to the wiki, it was.

11,900 kb in size. At the current limit, this would take at LEAST 12 blocks confirm (if all full blocks) right? Depending on your fee, bitcoin maturity, etc you could be waiting for 3 hours for at least one confirmation

This isn't like the internet where the user doesn't need to understand how TCP/IP works in order to use it. At the moment, understanding how Bitcoin works is vital so the user can use it properly and securely. Right now I see Bitcoin in its terminal phase, it needs that extra layer, and then a lot of time, for it to truly be trustless like most utilities which are taken for granted these days.
Or, who knows, give it enough time, to understand how Bitcoin and/or encryption works at its core might be widespread enough to become the norm. Much like how (most) average Joe's can write basic HTML

As a heads up, I had one account put in 'hold' during the set up process. It seemed promising but someone put a stop to it before it cleared the 'securty checks', I had the debit card and everything. The account opener advised the application will be put on hold for now as their stance on Bitcoin may change, here's to hoping it'll be soon now!

Flash drives should really only be used to transport unsigned/signed transactions between an online/offline computer. If you were to use a USB drive as a cold storage solution, back it up on other media aswell, the risk of corrupted data is too high.

How does this relate to peanut butter? Rather confused
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:34:16
That's great and all, but I hope that's due to you taking proper precautions to protect your wallet(s), such as cold storage.

Hi krona2k, thanks for ordering! 
When ordering groceries through us, we currently charge a standard £5 delivery on orders over £25 to cover any deliver costs with Tesco and then issue store credit for the difference, if it does end up cheaper. Tesco Gift Cards are best used when buying in-store, for petrol, etc and cannot be used online when ordering groceries at this time (hence we provide both the grocery and gift card services), you can also collect from your local store at no cost. Tesco slaps on an additional £4 for orders under £25 and removes the collection option.
For more information do check out our [Delivery]( info, [Price Promise]( and the FAQ on the [Tesco Gift Card]( product page.

A somewhat of an easy fix would be to display receive addresses every time on the Ledger device itself, if there is any discrepancy then you know you are compromised.

Isn't the 'wink wink nudge nudge' going to confuse the users, and inevitably cause a mass attempt to cash out?

I trade on both Localbitcoins and Bitbargain. Though whoever did it, may have grabbed the bank details and cancelled the trade immediately. I'm going to get it reversed, and I feel no remorse for the companies that set up the Direct Debits (easygym and o2), assuming they didn't do necessary identity checks.

Coinlenders, which was probably closest to a Bitcoin bank, recently closed but now sells copies of the site: 
@_date: 2013-08-17 11:44:23
..., camera for QR code reader, 'an internal strong box for the cash', software (UI, framework, presumably a networked backend, etc). 
It's $4000 if people group buy these things (like with the block eruptors and casascius coins). If you're a local business but don't want to worry about the cash and only accept bitcoin for your goods/services; don't pay a penny and just find a distributor (when they come around).

It seems so! Though I use my sole trader account, so it probably didn't seem so obvious when they set it up under that name.

My guess is that they probably debated it off-camera and decided to leave it from the show

I guessed that at first, but refer to TradeFortress' post on the now closed Coinlenders thread:

You could, but think of the severe disappointment on your face when you discover they're block eruptors and not blades x_x

I would completely advise against using these stamps when sending valuable Bitcoin related items such as Casascius coins or paper wallets. It's essentially a 'most likely worth some money' label to a sketchy post handler/thief.

Fellow seller on Bitbargain here; it's in the seller code of conduct to not release coins before spotting and confirming the payment. Assuming he followed that code, at one point he was confident that he had the funds. He should chase the issue with Pingit/his bank. Both buyer and seller should contact the admins/Bitbargain in this sort of situation.

Trading in this current climate is definitely inconvenient with a learning curve, but it doesn't mean you can't get a hand for it. Once you find your ins and outs and know where to look it becomes quite recursive and straight forward. 
It's also still all quite new; imagine how tedious online shopping was in the 90s.

A mixture of [Woocommerce]( [Woocommerce Currency Converter]( and [Bitcoin Payments for Woocommerce]( Though some coding is required to allow the currency converter and bitcoin plugin to keep the price conversions in sync, as they use different tickers I believe.
The currency converter is good because it will display the bitcoin price alongside the fiat price, where the customer can choose to pay via. Bitcoin or traditional methods (BACs, Paypal, etc)
I did a bit of a live experiment where I accept Bitcoin for groceries, fast food, games, etc.

Kind of, but there is/was an incentive to be a part of it. Instead of it being paid needless amounts with tax payer money, it's from volunteers with their own investments. To back up that argument, it's a more efficient means of an anti-counterfeit system, if you discount high-energy consuming GPU mining.
