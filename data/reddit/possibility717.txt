I hope this makes every pain you went through worth  it to get there! That’s my hope one day, to look back at all the trials and tribulations I’ve gone through and be able to say wow I’m glad I decided to keep pushing on. Congratulations and I hope that I am lucky enough to feel what you’re feeling one day. Enjoy it!

Why are you buying bitcoins if you don’t have enough money in your account? I’m not sure if they’ll cancel the transaction or not but to be safe I’d try and just make sure you get enough money in there as soon as possible, or see if you’re able to cancel it before it charges.

My coinbase app literally signed me off and won’t let me log back in. Whaaat.

Must be nice. Even when I lived at home I had to make my $60 allowance per month work or else I did not eat lunch or be able to go out anywhere.

So how do you plan to buy things you need day to day or do your parents still pay for your lunch?

There’s the app called portfolio. I just input the amount I bought at and how much and it keeps track.

I’m actually kinda looking forward to tomorrow. I think if everyone puts positive energy into it, our hodls will be well worth it

Talk to someone who knows a lot more than I do. But I would definitely take out at least 60-75%

What did you find?

You can send the money to your USD wallet on coinbase instantly instead of your bank/card, then you can use that to buy BTC

Genius

That would honestly make my year. If only!

Would quantum computers and advances in energy production make mining not as bad for the environment?
