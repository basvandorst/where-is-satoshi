diamonds price go up because the people who own diamonds charge ridiculous prices and people are willing to pay them.
bitcoin price is going up due to massive hype and speculation
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:39
I can guarantee you could sell at minimum $80 if you are ready when it comes up
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:23:35
its a joke about how it was 2 bil last week
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:25:43
its still a crash, and thats why there are so many trades, you are deluding yourself thinking its new rich people joining the market.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:10:01
Oh, lite coin and ppcoin(peer2peercoin)
Check which is best for you. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:27:48
For Ppc xpool is good. 
I thing ltc is currently 3x better though,  a good pool for that is notroll.in 
Guiminer scrypt is good. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:45:56
I think mining Ppc or ltc is more effective for gpu/cpu
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:52:10
And then converting the btc to whatever you want, it's only a 0.2% fee
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:03:34
btc-e is alive
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:44:07
You realize that's only $2 man. Go work overtime or something. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:29:52
Stop whining, you broke the first rule of investment. Don't invest more than you can lose. 
You really think something that went up 200 in a month is a good investment?  
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:24:01
Invest on any site that isn't mtgox(I recommend btc-e)   
Be ready to sell at any moment though. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:16:20
Mining bitcoins is really inefficient. Mine lite coins or ppcoins
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:20:06
yeah it is way better
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:00:34
You aren't the majority. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:09:55
I like btc-e
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:49
Good speed, nice usage, cheap
You will never get it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:17:19
200 is nothing mate, I see orders for 1000
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:21:43
I think when you make an account it doesn't ask for an email, so you have to do it manually afterwards. 
Just because you got hacked, doesn't mean the site was. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:23:17
This is why you don't invest more than you can lose. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:14:32
You are retarded mate. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:06:08
Avalon has actually shipped units. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:43:39
Convert to btc, withdraw to the btc e address. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:55:27
I would sell as soon as it comes back up, it's gonna drop to like 25-50
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:32:56
Not even Cyprus, just hype and speculation, as well as regret for not buying earlier. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:38:50
Ppc is a very energy efficient coin for mining, and ltc can't be mined with asics. 
Both are benefits that make them better than btc. 
Obviously markets can be manipulated. But the same thing happened to btc on Wednesday. Someone dumped and the price dropped 40$ and then it went right back up. 
Just because people are saying idiots that don't understand economics doesn't mean coins are bad.  
Also anything said in the chat box is people trolling and lieing, there are no power users or abusive mods either. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:52:39
I'm not the one threatening suicide on reddit to the guy trying to help. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:14:25
why not sell at 80 and rebuy when it crashes down as gox reopens
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:20:29
Not really, i had to refresh the page for 30 seconds but thats it
It is really reliable, even though its run by russians
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:45:00
If you use an online wallet and they get hacked I'm sure you can take them to court. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:44:04
Get your ass off reddit and go look then. Moping won't help. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:51:17
its about to drop to at least 60-70 when it comes back up
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:28:18
its about speculation now, no one cares what bitcoin is actually for
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:04:47
Why hack someone for 7btc when there are people with thousands on the site. 
I know that it's hard to believe but you got hacked. Maybe some bad mining software or something. 
You lost $1000, that's like half a months work at bare minimum.  Cheer up. Many others have lost much more. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:19:55
nearly impossible now, it was possible a couple years ago
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:59:50
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:06:48
stopped at 115
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:29:07
what if they accept btcs?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:18:06
Buy the rumor, sell the news. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:34:22
Missing the point that you get 3x as much. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:12:32
It starts with the mindset man. If you think you are shit,  you are gonna be shit. I'm sure you will find a job eventually. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:27:48
lots of buy orders, if it were to go below 90 right now there would have to be 4000 sold
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:25:46
It has something like 5-15%. of total trade volume
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:25:23
It actually went to 90 on some sites. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:17:12
its gonna crash so hard when it comes back up
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:07:54
And lor more than 700 were sold, more like 70000
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:22:10
The online poll is a joke, it just gets manipulated by 4chan every year. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:04:55
Btc e is great. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:47:27
the live order book is 100% up to date. updates every 60 seconds max
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:13:13
No kidding its everyone selling in the crash
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:58:51
No backing. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:35:59
cavirtex always has crazy prices
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:32:06
It helps prevent from fork attacks(controlling 51% of mining power. 
And as difficulty has gone up better hardware has been developed, which people have invested in. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:25
Lol no
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:15:19
The majority of people buying bitcoins right now are are doing it to try to get rich/invest, not many of them are buying them because of the inherent value in them. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:37:56
Sell sell sell
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:49:01
They will find a way if it becomes popular. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:39:59
Honestly you could make waaay more begging on a street corner, then converting it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:29:42
it was a mini bubble burst
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:35:07
They lost 4/5ths of whatever they had in the currency 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:41:01
bull trap watch out nigga
edit: heard it here first, ill take my tips in cash
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:07:17
I'm talking about gox. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:21:24
Gaben always responds to emails. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:54:34
And then you lose your money and commit sudoku
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:51:58
true dat nigga
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:28:35
Ltc can't be mined with gpus, and is currently 3x better than mining btc 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:46:30
fake and gay
your history says you are a racist from canada
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:05:48
Sell at 120 then re buy at 50, then withdraw. 
I think it's pretty safe though. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:02:23
btc-e is honestly the best, it has very very very little downtime, and the chatbox is 10/10 comedy gold.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:09:14
please learn to read
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:56
I believe in bitcoins so I buy 4 of them on Tuesday at 260 each, I plan to buy a computer with them,  but am still deciding which parts to get. One Friday I know what I'm getting so I go on,  only to find that my money is worth a fifth of what it was only 3 days ago!  Why would anyone back something so volatile I think,  so I cut my losses and cash out what I can. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:11:04
It wasn't ddos, it was everyone f5ing and mass selling. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:32:27
Lite coin widget is all the bottom ones. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:19:02
It's the god damn 40 minute trade lag
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:59:14
They could make it illegal to use bitcoins, they could put taxes on whatever banking things you used, they could audit you and ask where your money is. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:58:11
huge crash and dump down to 30
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:15:34
cavirtex is the fastest, paypal through virwox takes like 3 days.
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:57:52
Which aren't designed yet, and probably won't be due to the volatility of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:31:50
Honestly I would stay away from asics, the only legit ones I've see are avalon's, and they are out of stock
I would much rather invest into bitcoins directly.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:35:55
Yeah it's pretty average. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:57:06
Unsustainable, get ready for the crash. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:50:50
btc e has given me 0 issues over the past week
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:41:21
those aren't bots mate, when its a bot you will see the whole page will with 0.01s
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:59:16
ill take a look
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:50:12
Oh sorry I meant it can't be mined with asics. Just for ming though, you can just mine ltc, and then convert to btc. You get 3x as much with this method. 
And the advantage is it verifies transactions 4x as fast, so it would be good for small transactions in person. Who wants to wait 10 minutes to get some coffee. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:39:59
the real gambling in litecoins right now
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:43:26
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:24:36
if it goes above 100 again i will sell, but i think it is headed to like 60, where i will buy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:45:34
Seems like you don't know what intrinsic means. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:26:39
Just pretend that bitcoins crashed to 0,and move on in your life. 
You live somewhere with Internet, that is max 2 months salary even if you are in some second world country. I'm sure you can move past it. Have hope man
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:49:05
That's what everyone wants to think, everyone wants to be rich, that's why the price is shooting through the roof. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:26:29
like hell, just watch it go below 100 within 5 minutes of opening
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:53:03
Magic the Gathering Exchange
it is/was a card exchange before
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:15:35
stabilize at 150
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:48:14
Please explain further. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:01:12
This is a crash
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:55:35
It's going to crash to minimum $60
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:16:47
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:18:06
they haven't heard of it
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:03
This is going to cause it to crash so hard, everyone will sell as soon as its up...
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:55
You won't get anything shipped to you from butterfly labs for at least a year. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:36:32
I'm sure you will have a job eventually. Just go out into the world and look for opportunities. No one deserves to die either. 
Some simple advice, this too shall pass. Sure, you're going through a rough spot in your life. Take solace in the fact that it's only temporary. If you think this is the worst point in your life, that you are at rock bottom, then it can only get better. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:37:37
He doesn't have that many bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:40:10
convenience? where else is there a good auction site? And if it goes mainstream then people already using ebay will use them.
