I think the fantasy world is believing govs will succeed in enforcing un-enforcable rules, they will try sure, they always do, and a lot of people won't be ~~smart~~ knowledgeable enough not to get caught (cf people in prison for smoking weed.. and being part of a minority of course), but that won't be me and that won't stop us.

I don't understand why someone would use an *online wallet* (obviously my wallet is online too but on my system not abroad) either.

The legal environment that bank and capital created is incompatible with bitcoins, you can hope if you like banks and capital that the people will enforce these rules on themselves, that taxes shall be collected, that wars shall be fought, but you can't enforce it.

Bitcoins are political by nature, if you don't like politics, make your own sub and enjoy yourself.

i like how people justifying taxes never mention wars, deficit budgets... nor the real shady state of infrastructure despite massive taxes... not paying them myself but whatever rocks your boat though.

Figured that's the angle vice would take to cover bitcoins... vice is holding up to its name, as usual, i don't understand the love.

The latter part of your message is what i was thinking, there are tons of reasons why packets can be offsetted forward or backward in comparison to the flux.

They capitalized shares and banks bought them. Since bank are also behind printing dollars...

We can route money towards common good much better than the government, no need for institutionalized taxes anymore.
