LOL, last week it was. I even started a tor prototype. To be honest, the actual domain name doesn't matter so much.

Ahh dang, it was last week. 
Unless I bought that....have to check. 
In any case I have a server purchased with Bitcoin, and your domain sounds nice. I am decent at Bash/UX but think we need a smart guy from Ethereum or Blockchain.info to really make this site what we need it to be, and not get GOXED.

"...the ethics of it is thrown out the window...". 
Could you expand on this a bit? I felt also it was a tad creepy, but then realized what I disliked was buying politicians...which is exactly how the US Government currently works.

Ahh...didn't. sorry about that. I weanted to tie votes to the amount donated and thought we could use their client base for much of that functionality.

The only way I think that Government COULD "interpret" this as illegal, is if they want to. Off the top of my head, they would use laws preventing money from foreign countries paying for political candidates.
 
Excellent idea on the voting! :) Maybe we could get some smart guys over at Ethereum to look at this.

BitCoinNow.org is available.

--OK. I will send an email to the Ethereum project. and post the response on this thread. 
Cancel that...let's find someone who is already a coder on ethereum. The reason I bring this project up is because it automates voting and I believe could help us link the amount you donate to the number of votes you have.

Well, we'd have to engineer it not to be one. Would you care to suggest any solutions to your observation?
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:17:34
Cole, I think your suggestion would be the logical extrapolation of this concept 100 years from now. At first we would need to gain control of the local "representative" government through money, in much the same way GE and larger corporations have control over them now.
If allowed to continue on a global scale, eventually the common guy would have more money to donate to candidates globally. And, unlike large corporations, the public interest would be infinitely more granular and precise than any corporation, trade group, or union. 
Finally, if allowed to continue, this pattern would make the "representative" portion of any government into more of a 'figurehead' position, and it would be eventually deprecated. However...there would need to be at LEAST one governmental agency which made sure that the voting/funding system remained intact and uncompromisable.

Well. The mission statement of the site would need to be crystal clear. In my mind, something along the lines of:
To offer a monetary incentive to politicians who seek to officially recognize Bitcoin and act on its behalf in the halls of government.
We would need some agreed upon tenants we seek to reinforce like...
* Maintain It's Legality
* Maintain It's Privacy to the extent that it currently exists
* Prevent legislation controlling authorship or distribution of any crypto currency based system.
Would probably need to get smarter folks to opine on the above.

I didn't see that answer coming, how so?
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:05:23
Instead of you donating in USD to a candidate, each candidate would be proposing to us collectively, explaining to use what they could do to advance our cause...FOR BITCOIN.  In attempting to obtain BitCoin for their campaign, candidates will be making some legal interpretations of their own which, in and of itself advances BitCoin as a legitimate currency in the halls of government.

Did you join a mining pool? I had a similar problem until I did.
