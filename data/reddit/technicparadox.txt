Thanks man, really appreciate it. I will for sure be keeping it cold tho. I slack on network security for the sake of convenience, so I need to keep my sensitive shit really off the grid. Have a nice day.

Would you kindly tell me the program name? Cheers.

Thanks fixed that. I'm going to be fleshing out the content soon depending on public interest and business. Descending technical content makes sense, I'll try to move it around in a way that works, but still looks nice. Thanks for the suggestion.

I'll be 18 in 9 days, so I still live at home. It's masking tape though, no worries of permanent marks.

That makes sense. If anyone else mentions it I'll simplify it a bit for the average person. Thanks for the advice.

That makes sense. I'll see if I can format that a little better. Thanks.

Thanks for the tip. I'll just use some goo gone if that happens.
