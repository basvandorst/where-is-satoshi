yeah coinbase is what i mean. you do not trade with other coinbase customers, you buy and sell directly from them what is good i think. we need more companys like them.
problem is they were only good for us based customers.

Ah OK, thank you. I wasn't aware with that.

Hello, you have to become Friends with the bitcoin API. 
I'am thinking the same way like you. 
Much more smaller exchanges would Support the structure of a dezentralized currency.
But the biggest Problem i think is Not the technical Part. Its the legal in our countrys wich are Indeed Hostile envirmoments

A few more information for you. First i heard about bitcoins in 2011. As many of you i bought some, and in the meantime i nearly forgot them. The past month was one of the most exiting.
But one big problem we're facing is the concentration of exchanges. 80% of trades in one market place is good for the operator, but not for bitcoin itself. The weakest link in this chain.
Another problem is putting your funds to market places for trading. everybody read the headline in the past, burglaries, stolen wallets and so forth.
This is were we come in place. And much more i hope. 
We're a exchange, not a market place. We'll buy and sell. The  more exchanges will be, the lower the threshold will be for normal people out there, trying to get in touch with bitcoins, or cryptocurrencies generally.

yes your're absolute right. i would think the same. 
i just wanted to highlight the fact that bitcoin related business seems like no go nowadays.
they didnt ask anyways or gave me the opportunity to send them details like you mentioned. They just declined after i got in touch with them in first time after filling out their contact formular.

i withdrew only 1 BTC exactly 24h ago. Nothing happend in the meantime. But i think that doesnt say much, till now.

I think it depends mostly on the country itself. In germany there is BaFin. But that would be really interesting. Maybe we can collect some useful information so the threshold for creating smaller exchanges would be not so high.

We're small team from germany and croatia operating in UK.

Hello. How can we help you?
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:29:57
This is the major problem nowadays. Banks shutting down accounts for no  good reason is one big problem we have to solve. And by we i mean this is everybodys business who wants bitcoins to succeed. 
Crooks dealing with stolen accounts, changing money into bitcoins, thats the main reason for frozen accounts at exchanges. When we're up and running the exchange, on of the biggest task will be fraud prevention.

yeah localbitcoins go in that route i think, but not completly.
they were also a connector for people to exchange among themselves.
what i meant was a shop, where you can buy or sell cryptocurrencies like any other physical goods. so the risk for the user translocate to the merchant.

had an application sent to them for setting up ukash as a payment option for just another exchange.
