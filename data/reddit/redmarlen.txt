Thanks so much for you response. 
Isn't there a natural incentive for people to use segwit and if so why give a discount?
Why is the discount 75% and not some other number?


The link you provide doesn't say *if or how* old wallets will recognize segwit txs. My current understanding is that the old wallet will not be able to recognize the segwit payment as being confirmed and valid since segwit restructures the blockchain data.
Is there somewhere that explains what happens when a segwit tx is used to pay a user that is using an older wallet? 
Thanks in advance.

I understand this to mean that txs with more outputs will be more expensive.
So this will make coinjoin transactions relatively much more expensive? 
It's reassuring to know that old wallets will recognize the segwit tx confirm. Though I still don't get how it's possible for old wallets to validate segwit txs if signature information is encoded in a new way. 
Will old wallets also be able to spend those bitcoins? 
Could you please take a look here and consider a Segwit AMA at r/btc? It would certainly help to get clarity for such a complicated deployment.

So you say but I have searched for a lot of these answers such as the wallet impacts of segwit and its pretty obvious that a lot of people are confused about the impacts of segwit generally. It is changing a lot and its seems like its being rushed relative to a simple block size increase. Plus censorship problems so don't blame people asking questions and being confused. There are a lot of different kinds of people here with different head spaces and backgrounds. They are bitcoin users are they are sincerely trying to understand segwit and keep up with the proposed changes.     


I agree thanks. I'm also going to keep sharing my opinions too. 


I can't measure consensus easily when I see blatant censorship on the biggest bitcoin forums. Doing my best but it's very hard to resume good faith given the history of what's been happening. I prefer troll sifting versus control and censorship. 
From my point of view just raising the blocksize is so much more conservative with easy rewards relative to segwit. Seems like unforseen issues and implications could arise from segwit and its 75% discount. The best immunity to new complexity is time. Time for the hive mind of community to absorb and explore its implications. The different spaces of the bitcoin community need to understand segwit as well. Classic has a significant number of nodes 25% and over 5% of hashing power also the forum numbers are around 1/3. Including the great upgrades by the Bitcoin Unlimited team and Gavin, one of the original bitcoin developers, it seems to me the alternatives include significant part of the community. I can't just ignore that portion of the consensus. 
 thanks again

Well there are lots of bitcoin users who are confused and trying to understand segwit and future proposed changes. People are going to repeat controversial claims as fact and make accusations all the time. It's a pretty normal part of debating that one side plays the devils advocate and tests conspiracy. Conspiracies happen all the time, they are a normal part of business and life even. And the post I've made at r/btc about segwit AMA seems to have helped to clear up this controversial claim regarding old wallets. I genuinely appreciate your answers and I share your links enthusiastically and quickly despite at times showing silly mistakes and having to eat humble pie, so that others see your clarifications. 
It seems there are many others who are as confused as me and appreciate the links I provide. You may think its only one person you are answering but in fact as posts are searched and shared many people are assisted. There are answers that need to be shared with others who are at my level of understanding. Its the trolls that don't seek the developers out and just spout controversial shit or abuse that are doing everyone a disfavor. Devils advocates on both sides who are trying to test, probe and articulate within the different layers of the community are helping. There are all kinds of people in the bitcoin community from different backgrounds and head spaces and they all have to get segwit in their own language. A basic user has a very different perspective to a developer. To me segwit seems complicated and like you I have to explain it to others but the best way I see at dodging the FUD is asking around and getting as close to the sources as I can. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 19:00:53
Amazing work, thanks! But Segwit is too complicated too soon.
* Segwit restructures the blockchain 
* Segwit gives 75% fee discounts to special bytes so it restructures the economics 
* Segwit is not compatible with old wallets since they won't receive segwit txs. Users who are sent a segwit txs will therefore not see it confirmed and will not be able to spend the received bitcoin whereas the sender will see the tx as being confirmed. 
Complicated is great if the benefits are worth it but being complicated demands time for discussion and integration. Seems too risky to deploy segwit too soon.

Indeed! The planet having living things as its brain cells (through all their natural communications) now has developed an internet which acts as the infrastructure for long term memory. Previously the planet's thinking capacity was distributed and as such there was no organized lucid conscious activity. Bitcoin serves an organized consensus for an accurate history and is the key function of a lucid long term memory.
The planet, as a dreaming baby, is waking up and soon will think for the first time with organized consensus forming its ability to live a lucid life.

Thanks I understand that outcome. I'm considering possibility that the dynamics of the network economics of a 75% fee discount may have unintended consequences such that non-segwit transactions actually become more expensive post segwit. I am looking for different points of view that analyze various economic consequences - especially to reveal potential unintended side effects if any.

Ok great .... that was a passive aggressive post but we got there. Yes I am going to push, be skeptical and ask questions and play devils advocate all the way. Some people are going to confuse this for trolling but its also a good way for me to learn and contribute. I am sticking to questions of principle not abusing people or making smart ass jibes. I suffer from senseless trolling but you know the skeptics of r/btc when they are on points of principles I appreciate that. I want both sides of the hide mind to be sharpened. I want to protect my bitcoin investments like all of us and I want to test all my skepticism. If I don't get good answers then I will jump ship. The censorship has raised my skepticism to maximum levels and it will take some time for me to return to implicit trust.   
"Segwit is too complicated too soon" is my opinion and I still think that is the smartest position. Regardless of the benefits of segwit is complicated. That is not a controversial fact. It seems my point about old wallets was wrong but not the point about segwit complexity. It is not just the developers that need to understand segwit but the community needs to integrate the changes and their impact. So when changes are complex like segwit they should be delayed even if the experts feel they are ready and impatient to deploy. Its wise to allow complicated changes time to saturate the community's hive mind.
I appreciate your providing information as it's not that easy to google answers to some of these weird questions. Thanks.

Using electrum you can set the Network settings to 
TCP, SOCKS5, localhost, 9150 
I don't know if its necessary to use one of the onion electrum servers. Also I think that Tor changes exit node automatically every so often?
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:40:48
Scatter - a feature which implements single input transactions broadcasted at random intervals in Electrum.
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:14:15
I think it makes tracing a lot more difficult because the target of a slow address becomes indistinguishable from the kind of payments where someone hands out a public key and then many people randomly donate to that key. 
But I could see in  some situations that there could be traceability too. The Scatter and Slow Send bring plausible deniability though. It depends on how the wallet was being used. I imagine that if a wallet only ever uses single input transactions the privacy is greatly improved. I've posted this on reddit so that I could get more feedback and perhaps improve the Scatter and Slow Send features to cut of more and more leaks. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:10:06
hmmm great you've given me an idea! I could trigger a random server switch in electrum per scatter broadcast. 
Also I could update the default server list and perhaps collect a bunch of Tor onion servers and give an option for the user to force the use of Tor onion servers. Does it really make a difference though to use a Tor onion server for this use case.... anyone?

How did you know to raise your fees? Users only learn there is fee instability after they have a problem with a slow transaction. We can make bitcoin smooth today by raising the block size limit. It's moronic to cause predictable problems with the network when its so easy to make it run smoothly with cheap fees.


Ummm a bitcoin transaction is simply sharing information about what one values. 


lol... I impose nothing. But we know you guys have to ban our comments because our ideas make sense. If you thought our ideas were so bad you would let them stand to expose our bad logic. Instead your banning them what do you think that tells me?

We are talking about protecting customer bitcoin accounts with 2of2 msig-tx addresses. 
When a customer wants to sell bitcoin they transfer to the exchange 2of2 account. The customer pre-signs a bunch of transactions that send bitcoin to every other of the exchanges existing 2of2 customer accounts. When a buy order is executed for a seller the exchange finds the pre-signed transaction that matches the buyers account and broadcasts that one. The rest are deleted. 
When a customer wants to withdraw they sign first, the exchange signs and broadcasts. So no need to hold. 
If a customer is using margin they pre-sign transactions sending their bitcoin from their 2of2 to the exchanges own cold wallet. If a margin call is triggered the exchange broadcasts the held transaction. This would probably be split into many chunks.
All a hacker can do is broadcast pre-signed transactions. A hacker can cause a bit of a mess but not steal lots of bitcoin very quickly. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:11:46
It is an issue when people complain. The bitcoin network needs to perform smoothly. The less people that have to bump into confirmation problems the better. Denying that anyone had a problem is just as bad as claiming that bitcoin has failed if the network is slow. The less "fee events" that cause some transactions to fail the better. The smoothness of the network is vulnerable when fees change suddenly - this is bad. Raising the block size limit means the "complaint" ceiling is further away so complaints happen less often. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:06:12
It includes the amount and all the details are fixed. All that can happen is the pre-defined transactions are broadcasted or not broadcasted.
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:51:51
The best way to find the limit is to eat all the transactions you can, smile and dig in again i.e. bigger block size limit and call out for more nodes and network resources. With each wave of transactions you grow your capacity. Unfortunately this simple strategy has not been tried yet. IF you try this and there are still too many txs to prevent the mempools bloating THEN miners establish relationships with the most valuable micro-transaction services with low/zero fees and prioritize those.
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:17:53
Reddit is also vulnerable to sybil attacks. At least  has a filter for verification to address the issue. It would be nice if reddit had the same. The site is simply an opinion visualization tool. It's great to see the faces of people in the community and have all the opinions visualized. 
Bitcoin itself is consensus software which addresses sybil attacks through mining. *In Bitcoin the longest chain is the valid chain.* The byzantine generals problem that Satoshi solved is the problem of getting consensus while exposed to sybil attacks. So the problem is already solved.

There is no point in creating a "trial and error" education layer which happens to limit the capacity of the network. Sure there are important things to learn in order to leverage bitcoin safely but these practices come with features. Having a capacity ceiling that predictably causes user complaints is surely unproductive. 


Bitcoin is basically just 2 things: bitcoin = free speech + mathematics. If free speech and mathematics are human rights then so is bitcoin.

It is extremely unproductive to recommend that bitcoin could succeed via creating a requirement that users must visit a certain website before making any transaction. That is very far from a smooth user experience. A smooth user experience is easy to achieve by raising the blocksize limit so that fees are never volatile. Even a smart wallet suggesting fees can suggest the wrong fee and so cause a delayed tx whenever there is fee volatility. There is only fee volatility when the block size limit being too low causes the mempool to bloat. 


Really.....so I am sure you can specify then how exactly a bitcoin transaction is something other than sharing information about what one values? 
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:58:15
Classic coin only activates with a majority of mining power. You know its not an altcoin because otherwise there would be no need for the minority to rewrite the mining algorithm. If you want to follow a minority fork go ahead but I'm sure everyone will just adjust their block size limits to align with the majority chain. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:34:22
LN does not exist still so till it does people will be unsure about its performance. If there is demand *now* for bitcoin why wouldn't we accommodate that growth by delivering the cheapest possible transactions to the world? A 2MB block size limit is tiny, an insignificant upgrade and a maximum compromise. So the delays in increasing the block size limit have caused a loss of faith (what you call hate) toward those who resist it. It's obvious that many people want 2MB yet those resisting have delayed this **for years**. Classic supporters are frustrated since the mempool is bloated and new users to bitcoin are having poor experiences. Frustrating when all transactions in the mempool at the moment could easily be processed by increasing the block size limit and calling on the network participants to add more nodes and resources.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:30:38
Thanks, I see what you mean, there is the consensus between rules which nodes test to validate each block (such as the block size limit test). There is also consensus for selecting between competing chains of the latest mined blocks i.e. the longest proof-of-work chain. Regarding these two kinds of consensus Satoshi in the abstract and conclusion of his white paper said:
"As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers." 
"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."


Who determines the system's rules to define validity? As Satoshi says above, nodes vote with their CPU[mining] power, and if the network has nodes which implement conflicting system rules, then it is the majority mining power that produces the longest chain that is the valid chain. The minority mining power produces a chain that is *also* valid to its own nodes but with less security. 
Since at this point there is a majority chain and a minority chain it makes no sense to say "Bitcoin nodes follow the longest valid chain" because at this point there are two longest* valid chains! When this is the case it is not their length that determines which is valid but the network mining power. The majority mining power is said to be more valid (to the market) since it has better security so it is valued more highly. 
Bitcoin nodes should* follow the majority mining power to determine which system rules are *needed* to test validity. This is what Bitcoin Unlimited nodes do with the block size limit rule.* And for each bitcoin node to determine which proof-of-work chain to use the longest chain is the valid chain.

The lower the block size limit the cheaper it is to spam the mempool. A lower block size aids spam that bloats the mempool. A larger block size and a call for more nodes and more network resources will process all the transactions in the mempool and reduce complaints from users. If the mempool fills again then increase the block size again and call out for more nodes and more resources. The best way a p2p network can respond to a ddos is to call out to the network participants for more nodes and more resources. When was the last time a bloated mempool was met with a call for more nodes and a larger block size limit? 
@_date: 2016-01-28 08:40:25
In an open community the best ideas manifest. But the censorship and banning of some users has caused people to doubt that is happening anymore. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:09:54
We could raise the block size limit and call out to network participants for more nodes and resources. As if the bitcoin community would fail to respond and eat up the transactions. So there is an easy quick fix.
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:15:43
You don't realize that you prove the point for a block size increase with your comment. A too low block size limit makes this spam attack cheap. If we raise the block size limit and call out to network participants for more nodes and resources it becomes much more expensive. As if the bitcoin community would fail to respond and eat up such few transactions. Afterward the cost of this spam attack would be much more expensive. We could easily expand the network, process everything and laugh at the attempts to spam.
@_date: 2016-03-02 01:35:16
Yeah exactly. And it helps those network participants if it costs more to bloat. That way we have more nodes, more network resources, more decentralization.

 has nothing to do with bitcoin governance actually since it is a tool for recording and visualizing opinions. It is "read only" in the sense that it does not generate actionable items. That was one of his main points. So it simply is a way that we can understand what others in the community are thinking. The site deals with sybil attacks via user verification and filtering. Looks great to me if you turn on the verification filters.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:45:19
There are a lot of people in the bitcoin community who need to discuss Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT and the others. They are not altcoins otherwise the mining algo wouldn't need to be changed in case of a fork. Also they only "activate" with majority mining power which is exactly the mechanism Satoshi describes for picking system rules in the conclusion of his whitepaper. So they are competitive clients with differing system rules. The Bitcoin community needs to engage constantly now and in the future to select the best rule set. Let the discussions of an open community determine which are bad or good. Obviously bad ideas will be shot down without needing to resort to censorship. Censorship/moderation creates drama and confusion. People are smart enough to think for themselves and figure out the bias inherent in the forum tools they are using.
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:45:05


No. You should be measuring in $/kb. One can't separate these since valuations are relative. With a small block size limit it clearly requires less transactions to bloat the mempool. Fees are irrlelvant once the mempool is full complaints are already swelling. Rising fees are a consequence of previous slow/unconfirmed transactions. Bitcoin is better when transactions confirm quickly. It is not better when transactions confirm slowly, cause doubt for the user so the user tries again with higher fees. This is a terrible outcome. 


Seriously!? By that logic the optimal block size limit would be 1 byte. Easy on bandwidth *but no capacity*. P2P networks provide capacity by making network resources **available**. DDOS attacks are best avoided by increasing network resources i.e. bigger block sizes and a call out to network participants for more nodes and resources. IF the network tries this and txs are still slow THEN miners deprioritize zero/low fee transactions 
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:57:00
Yes of course its efficient, otherwise whoever created the transaction wouldn't have done it. Just because a transaction is small doesn't mean it shouldn't be on the blockchain. The price of a coffee to someone in the USA might be the price of a load of groceries to someone in Africa.
