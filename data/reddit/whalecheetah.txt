I'm totally with you on 1 to 4. About North Korea though. We aren't getting in a war. People aren't dying. As far as I'm concerned that's pretty good. I understand how the moralist types can say well he's shaking hands with a dictator and on the same level and all of that, but, people aren't dying. 
Compared to pretty much everything else he has done including his debt-fueled economy, North Korea is kind of a shining example in his portfolio

It's a really simple but genius idea if you think it through. If you have an asset with a fixed Supply and can take most of it off the market you can put the price whenever you want to and slowly slowly sell into people after establishing a much higher value. There really isn't that much Bitcoin for sale right now which is part of the reason we saw it take off like a rocket up to 14,000. Now we have some Trump Fud. Came in right at a technical level. Shake the tree a little bit and get the weak hands. The past 5 monthly candles have been green so historically the sixth is going to be red. It's been over five years since we had six green months in a row. I'm just not really sure what price level they are going to defend. It's possible the low is already in for the month and it's also possible it's going to be 8500 to 9400. I know if we see anything with an 8 in front of it I'm definitely going to get a little bit more. If we don't, no big deal I have plenty to let ride

Risk Assets in general go up. Hard assets go up. I mean I've been around Bitcoin for a few years now and I know there is still a group of you who think this is a completely decentralized currency that is immune to all of the bullshit in the financial system
Personally I think hedge funds and major investment houses own most of it and they still see it as a risk asset. There's still a pretty substantial correlation to the S&amp;P 500 when you look at bitcoin price

Yes. What really will get you is if you look at the order books plus or minus $500 on the big exchanges. There really aren't that many Bitcoin for sale. A large portion of them have been taken off the market which is going to make it easy to squeeze the price. 
I mean I can practically tell you how this is going to go. People have been stacking sats ever since Bitcoin was 6k then when it dropped all the way down to 3K. As we go up some people probably took a little profit at 13k. People are going to take a little profit at 20 k and about that time retail is going to catch on again . we're going to have a whole bunch of new people. As the price continues higher people again who bought much earlier are going to take a little profit every ten thousand or so. More people are going to discover Bitcoin. Over the next 18 months it's probably going to go higher than most of us think it will. Am I a wizard? No I'm just telling you what has happened ever since 2009. Consider that a history lesson

There's another angle on this that hasn't been spoken about in the news. If we drop interest rates nearly to zero guess how much easier the national debt is to finance. That no longer strains GDP in the same way. That's a scenario that's bullish for both gold and Bitcoin and buying bonds. Coincidentally all three are doing well this year

It's actually in a pretty nasty downtrend against the dollar. Hanging around 1.12. A few years ago a euro was worth 1.35
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:49:56
I think rate cuts are definitely better for it compared to hikes. The entire global economy is set up for a low-interest environment right now. There will be a lot of portfolio rebalancing and changes if rates go higher. As much as people don't want to admit it there are a lot of hedge funds and big investment houses that hold a lot of Bitcoin. Many of them still see it as a risk asset
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:24:54
Plan number one is trust and security. A currency only has value if people have trust in it. That truly matters more than anything and Bitcoin has that down. I mean if you got $5,000 worth of any crypto you wanted but you had to keep it there and not touch it for 10 years which would you choose? There's my point about trust
Scaling and Global Currency. It's really hard to say where that's going to go. You can't make something that directly tries to overthrow the US dollar unless you want the US military getting involved. This leads into the digital gold argument. Bitcoin behaves more like gold than it does to the US dollar. There is a fixed amount and as fiat currency devalues Bitcoin in theory should continue to appreciate. One of the reasons it has had such a massive run since creation is because many many people feel it's undervalued for what it is. I mean if you look at things we are up roughly 4X from the December low and there is considerable room to go. That's called price Discovery in a free market. How do we assign items value. Well people are still trying to figure that out with Bitcoin and that's why there is still a lot of potential for growth and potential for early investors. By the time it's obvious to everyone and the market has settled it's going to be similar to gold and you're going to have a lot less opportunity

Okay that's your personal feeling but it doesn't really have anything to do with what's actually going to happen
Rates are heading lower. It's the only way they can keep the game of musical chairs going
Some of you might call this hyperinflation. It's going to add a lot of liquidity that is going to find its way into risk assets and also hard assets. In America you are likely to see a point come off the mortgage rates over the next year or so. That's going to keep housing prices heading higher. Gold broke out of a multi-year basing pattern.
Another big picture topic is the national debt. It becomes a lot easier to sustain these gigantic numbers when the interest rate gets lower and lower. 
A lot of people still haven't wrapped their head around this, including apparently a lot of you guys. You might not have a bubble burst this time. You might just hook the bubble up to the air compressor
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:25:08
As exchanges go it's one of the safer ones and if you only have a few hundred dollars or maybe a thousand bucks is really not the biggest risk in the world. The reason people don't trust exchanges is because they have had a habit of being hacked scammed and ran off with over the years. If that actually happened to coinbase and they didn't immediately make everyone whole the crypto Market would take a gigantic leg down anyway so there is that

Look at gold. Asset with known supply. There is a LOT of hodl gold but it comes out as prices rise.  Btc will do the same. The reason I don't think we are seeing it now is because most feel this usd price is to low. What about 20k. 30k etc. As we go up more coins will come to market and you start finding your equilibrium. 
On an asset growing in popularity the price gravitates up over time.

When someone says is it digital gold or peer-to-peer cash that was one of the talking points for team bch. It was usually a lead in to well if it is peer-to-peer cash than it needs to have big blocks and super low fees. That has been hashed out before and to make a long story short you can't infinitely scale blocks without greatly compromising security. Second layer Solutions need to be found which is why there has been so much development on Lightning Network. We did get a block size increase with segwit but the magic about that is it didn't compromise security and it is completely backwards compatible.
There isn't really a lot of argument about digital gold it's just kind of like look what it does and there are a growing number of people wanting to store value in Bitcoin. I mean if you look at the average exchange there's really not that many for sale.

Sure, right now the FED funds overnight rate hovers between 2.25 and 2.5%. The entire yield curve is influenced by this. Loans are all based on treasuries Plus. That means a mortgage right now that is 4% is going to be just a little over 3% if we knock a point off the overnight rate all things equal. The yield curve adjusts down. It's not a direct one-to-one correlation which is why I said just over 3%. If people are able to borrow money more cheaply they can spend more for the same payment. Again this isn't an exact number but let's just say someone needed a million dollars at 4%. Well at 3% they can borrow even more and it 2% they can borrow even more still for the same payment. This allows for more spending without any real growth or increase in income. It goes for businesses and it goes  for individuals.

The reason I brought that up is because what you said is pretty much their marketing Playbook. I've heard it before and well it's pretty easy to put two and two together. 
If you want to get pissed off and leave and say we are all cultists that's your own personal choice. What I would tell you is stick around and keep learning. I thought everyone was weird when I first found Bitcoin. In fact I actually came across Bitcoin in the very very early days back in 2011 and thought it was a scam leaving it alone for another six years until a friend of mine brought it up in 2017.

No it's actually only part of the point the other part of the point is juicing economic growth or at least what they report as growth
You also push asset prices higher. Those of you who refer to the economy as a bubble, I guess a good way to run the analogy would be hooking the bubble up to an air compressor. It keeps the musical chairs going a little longer. Japan has been successful with doing this for quite some time

The big issue with gold is divisibility. The only way it would really work is to peg a currency to it and issue coins with x amount of gold per dollar. Pure 24k would be hard to make work at modern prices. 1/10th of an ounce is about the size of a dime and worth 142 usd right now

I'm not sure it's going to be all that terrible this time. It really depends on how they handle things over the next few months. If the FED gets in front of this and drops the overnight rate quickly you're going to have a lot of liquidity in the system. Had they done this in 2007 the financial crisis would not have been what it was. 
I see a lot of warning signals out there but Traders are not trading on them. They are looking at the massive amounts of liquidity coming to the system and asset inflation. Gold is going higher. Bonds are going higher or lower yield for those of you who don't trade bonds. Risk assets across the class are going to go higher and that includes Bitcoin.
The big question really; is are we going to see the FED aggressively cut before stocks eat shit or are they going to wait for a bit of a sell-off and then get really aggressive

I don't think it really wouldn't matter that much I mean you could use silver as well but you also could just add whatever microgram of gold is necessary for smaller dollar amounts alloyed into nickel or copper. 
All of this of course would create hard money and if we did that there would be no way to mask the myth of growth. Currency manipulation is one of the ways they can make it appear like the economy is growing even when real growth is extremely low. You can even see this big picture when you look at the price of gold. 200-250oz of gold bought you a house in 1910. Still does today. Dollar amount on the other hand. 5000 and 500,000

Politics. Republicans want to pump money into the wealthy and ruling class. Democrats want a lot of debt-fuelled giveaways. In the case of Education you could make the argument that spending the money on government-funded education would increase tax revenue. I mean it's the reason High School is free here. The thing is if you raise the education level for everyone wages are going to go down on those jobs as there will be more available workers. There's definitely pushed back from people who already are established and don't want more competition. I don't really think that's working because we just keep importing people from other countries and they take the jobs. Coincidentally ucn anti-immigration push from a certain segment of society and maybe some of them are racist but I think a lot of them realize that if we import a lot of educated people they become less valuable

Cost of college is one. It's free and other countries and costs the average citizen about 120k here. Second is the family structure. Upper-end snobby families in India actually do a pretty good job pushing their children to achieve. In America we have a large percentage of the population that just doesn't have involved parents. Kids don't have that push to achieve. Math and technical skills are also not at the front of the line as a good majority of the population makes decisions based on emotion not logic. American culture often reinforces that

There is definitely bias and they're probably always will be. If an event happens and it benefits one party, they can report factual information and still have a bit of a bias by leaving out other information. That would be a huge step up from where we are. You have people like Alex Jones pushing conspiracy theories and acting like they are the alternative real news and people are falling for it. The stuff doesn't check out more times than not and they may throw in a sliver of Truth here in there and say look this is exactly how it is. Then it's back to the ranting. If you're going to have a factual Network how are you going to Market it? What's going to fund it?
The idea of fact-based news sounds great in theory but how are you going to get it in front of the people? How are you going to make sure it doesn't turn into another Infowars?
The reason I'm a little pessimistic about all of this is because media manipulation has been going on since at least ancient Rome when the news reader back then would say what Caesar and the Senate told him to.

not sure if it will ever become a world reserve but it's already becoming a recognized item of value. nothing else {but gold and it took thousands of years) went from having almost no value to quite a lot of value all on its own. this part is really amazing if you think about it. people market and push projects 24-7. 
\\bitcoin went from under a cent to 6500 right now all on its own. the world has already voted on it being a recognized currency.  in the modern age it really does everything gold does only better., easy to send and easier to store. it is however easier to lose but in the grand scheme...that makes it even more scarce. there will only be, what? maybe 17m bitcoins ever? doubt anyone knows for sure how many have been lost since 2009

Have you actually thought about why that three to four K rumor has been going around? If people are convinced the price is going to go that much lower they are going to hold off on buying. That lets the smarter money accumulate right now.
Sooner or later the price will start to rise and then all the people who were waiting for 3 to 4 K or going to think okay it's coming sometime. We will start making a series of higher highs and higher lows and then the fomo begins. 
When you hear hedge funds make statements it's not in your interest. The other day when Mike novogratz called the bottom. The only thing that means is he probably has a good long position. People like tone vays have thrown out some low prices but he's also doing it in a worst-case scenario type statement. If you listen to the guy long enough he says the first step is getting to 5000 and seeing how things react. The low prices are not guaranteed and people have also asked him if he as sold and he will be the first to tell you he has not. Think about that one for a minute. If he hasn't sold how much does he really believe that super low price prediction

It's not necessarily better it's the historical pattern with Fiat. It keeps losing value every year.

There are a couple of scenarios and it's impossible to tell which one is playing out. They could have used the Bitcoin to buy tether and drive the market higher if the Bitcoin was sold OTC and the seller is holding. It could be the short scenario.
The safe way to play it in my opinion is to set up stop losses on a part of your trading stack and then have limit buy orders going down. If the market runs higher you still have your coins. If it turns around and Falls I don't think it's going to go slow.
It's just really rare that you see this kind of coin come out of Cold Storage after so long.

that's a very basic way to look at it. you're not really wrong but most of the miners now are very optimized. costs are as low as they are going to get. if price drops it's a game of chicken to see who folds as the ones on credit would fall first i suppose.

That deleted tweet? That said and I quote I have a feeling this bull run will be a pretty significant one? It took me a minute to actually find that
If we start a bull market Bitcoin is likely to lead. The majority of the alts are nothing but Bitcoin funnels anyway. Speculative assets that the gamblers get into and the people that create them get rich. The real Market is and always has been Bitcoin. I'm not discounting every alt in that comment. Monero is useful. Ethereum classic might have a bright future if shit coins go into production again. Etherium I'm not sure about. There's a big divide in the community and if they drive away all the miners and go proof of stake or low-reward it's hard to imagine that working out well for them. 
Then of course there is the really really speculative shit like holochain. If I had to guess I think that one is probably going to get pumped over the next 36 months. They are already drafting up the stories for it and it just started Trading. Almost certainly a complete shitcoin but I bet people are going to buy it Hook Line &amp; Sinker
It's completely possible they are gearing up to turn the market. The overall sentiment is very bearish. Good time to run in the shorts really. If they do what I suspect they are probably going to bring it down one more time. There's also the possibility that inside information has leaked out about the SEC decision. If that's positive and some people know they would have an amazing Edge
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:24:08
None of that really matters honestly. It's all about how the market reacts to it and an excuse for a directional change. We just had that happen with Goldman Sachs and the announcement of them not having plans for a crypto desk. People that have commented on this that work in the industry have said nothing has changed. They were floating the idea but there have never been any solid plans. That however became something to point that for the recent sell-off. 
The real question is basically how many people who got in on the ground floor that have large Holdings want to just get out? Because if they do they are going to continue selling technical levels like they have been all year. When you hear people like tone vays continually point at 2014. If you look at the charts, so far, he's not wrong even though he might be in the future

Probably. As others have pointed out markets have been manipulated since the dawn of man. You get a few people together who control over a hundred thousand Bitcoin  and then allow them to use margin. They can do whatever they want with the price
 However this is exactly why it's likely to go higher. It's in their best interest to draw in as many people as possible if they ever want to diversify out. It also creates these upward and downward Cycles which allows them to increase their Holdings as they sell into the Euphoria and buy panic
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:47:46

There's actually a way to get some use out of this. You have multiple scenarios with some evidence pointing at them so you don't really know which way it's going to go but you do know it's probably going to really go One Direction or the other pretty hard. Set up part of your stack on a stop loss. If we break 7500 on a good candle bring out the reserve money and buy more. Look to take some back off around 10,000.

It's way too early for long-term holders to be thinking of exiting. From a trading perspective the market is still in a midterm bearish pattern. That's not a good time to sell because you have people trigger happy with the shorts. The best time to sell is when everyone is euphoric and the chart looks perfect. If someone has been sitting on a hundred thousand coins since 2014 I really don't think they are impatient
My gut feeling is they're setting up for a capitulation bottom. But like I said in another post it could be a fake out. So many people expect that. The short interest just went rocketing up. It's really not a bad time to take out the upper pivot because very few people expect that

@_date: 2018-09-15 19:05:04
i don't know why you're getting downvoted. these are legitimate questions that people all have asked, or should have.
1. most things of value can be argued they are a pyramid scheme. why are some older comic books worth over 50k? why is a ferrari f40 worth over a million? why is gold even worth over 1k an ounce? supply and demand is the answer with everyone of those including bitcoin. 21m total that will ever be mined and probably 17m total in actual circulation. many have been lost over the years
2. bitcoin isn't competing with the usd  but it can be an inflationary hedge. on the money spectrum it's more along the lines of gold than fiat. it's a fixed supply, sound money that can not be inflated. it's easier to send and easier to divide than gold and the younger generation is more interested in it. back in the 80s people rapped about gold all the time. now bitcoin is getting into the lyrics. it's early but it's happening. bitcoin also is a bit of a freedom index. look at the countries that have banned it. they are VERY authoritarian and they really haven't been able to stop it. only stop exchanges in said countries. 
3. you can reprint valuable comic books and create gold looking metal as well. one of the BS lines in crypto is token x is better and more useful than bitcoin. 99.9% of the crypto market has no use. multi million dollar projects like augur have 50-60 active users. they are heavily marketed and keep failing. bitcoin on the other hand grew from under a cent to its current value all on it's own. no marketing squad. no company.
4. i think you're wrong about bitcoin and sentimental value but it only has such to people who understand what it is. with each passing year more people realize what it is. they study, they "get it" the majority of the population still does not and likely won't for decades. each time we make a new high waves of people come to market.  after the crash some stay. we grow in stair steps
5. gold has very little intrinsic value outside of some tech and industrial uses. old comic books have no intrinsic value and old ferrari's are outdone by a sub 100k car made today on the track. bitcoin has value because it's a scarce resource. if the entire planet suddenly decided it had no value. you're correct, it wouldn't. the odds of that are slim to none as we have proven it does have value or it never would have risen over the past decade.  society votes on the value of objects daily. what if everyone suddenly decided any object was worth less? it's kind of a fantasy argument
6. do you even know what blockchain is? most the people who make that statement don't truly understand it
7. if you want an official crypto how is that any different than the usd? the core point behind bitcoin is decentralized sound money. we don't want government controlled project money where the rich get richer and the rest of us get the shaft. in the past 50 years wealth inequality has accelerated. you lose money on a daily basis with fiat. the best fiat like the usd is very controlled at roughly 3% a year but it's still there. the idea with bitcoin is to have a currency that can transmitted as easily as the us dollar but with the properties of something like gold all in a decentralized package. again, ask yourself. how does something with no marketing team and no company go from a cent to 6500 in a decade? that's the market speaking.  you asked good questions. realize some people are very emotional about this and that's why they went to town with the downvote button. this however should show you the sentimental attachment. they defend bitcoin like their family

Not sure there is a lot more Hope on the Van eck ETF than there was on that group that they denied. It's also not a purely fundamental question. A lot of news events are excuses or reasons for a directional move. An ETF would bring more money to the space but a denial doesn't really change anything compared to today. However as we have seen. People are looking for an excuse to sell this year. I'm not sure if it's just a lot of people who bought in early wanting to get out that missed last year or what the deal is but we are at the end of this massive descending wedge that we have drawn out all year. We're either going higher or breaking support before the end of October. My question was just what the excuse will be for it. I suspect the ETF will probably be it

All you need is a liquid Exchange. 1 million is not that difficult to get off of. Even 10 million. Basically what you do is set up limit orders on days the market is ticking up. If you had 10 million for example I would start out selling between 2 and 5 Bitcoin. Get off of those on an uptick. Watch the chart patterns and try not to disturb things. When I'm exiting I want to do it on strength so selling a Bitcoin or two every 30 min could help someone get 10 million in cash in roughly a week without having an effect on the market if it's done at the right time. Now if you try to do this when the market is tanking your 10 million is going to be more like 9 or less. 
You can also set up sell ladders 5btc 5btc and so on. As long as you keep the selling on limit orders it allows you to slowly exit out. If you just click market sell and there is a lot of buying pressure you're fine. If there is not you can drive the price down. Depending on how thin the order books are it could be hundreds of dollars
Gemini also offers OTC auctions

I don't see any of those having future potential. Maybe eth but the other two are just marketing. How do they make money? They don't. What makes them special compared to something else? Just because they have better marketing hype? Wait till you see the next generation of scam coins. They are going to have all kinds of hype on those
The only alt I can think of with an actual purpose is Monero. It's great for buying drugs online and sending money out of tightly regulated countries without getting caught
@_date: 2018-09-08 03:53:30
they can choose to sell or not to though. the daily inflation via miners is variable based on their choices. this is one argument for a sideways market. if we sell down to 5k they aren't selling. we rally up to 7.5k they will as the cost of production for hydro and solar right now after expenses is mid 5s . maybe 5 flat if the guy works a lot himself and they can get cheap land. raw cost is about 3.7k but you need the buildings, equipment, employees etc. miners can floor the market by not selling and cap it just as easy when they do.....until more demand comes to town

Normal yes. He wants to stay anonymous. Trolling on the other hand is just stupid unless you're trolling r/btc in which case it's perfectly acceptable
 The reason I don't think there is any conspiracy theory is because just the fact those coins move doesn't really tell someone what's going to happen next. If you read through all the comments in this thread there are bullish and bearish scenarios that can play out the only thing that seems certain as we are going to see a fairly good-sized move in September. 100 million in tether that was just printed today also adds fuel to the suspicion
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:35:49
Yeah what's going on is there is a good deal of infighting over the block reward. That's going to drive away a lot of GPU Miners and a lot of them hold eth. Then of course you have all the scam coins with their Treasure chests full. A lot of them have already sold out but I really would not be surprised to see ethereum go as low as $130 before this is all over
All of those token projects have no way to generate income. What are they going to do to try to stay afloat? That's right, sell etherium

The bottom line is no one really knows how this is going to play out we just know it's likely we're going to have Direction and a substantial move in September. There are a variety of things coming into play. 
You can set up stop losses on part of your stack at lower trend lines. For a lot of people including myself it becomes much mentally easier if I leave most of what I hold in cold storage and only trade maybe 10%. Taking some off right now is easy if you do that. Even if you're completely wrong and this thing goes to the moon most of your stack is in Cold Storage. If it goes lower you have money ready to go and you can buy your coins back cheaper.

A lot of people are tribal and traditionalists. They continue doing what they've been taught and that's just how they operate. If you look at a lot of bizarre social customs. Well if it's not logical it's probably traditional and that's why it's still done.
Ever notice how everyone that comes to bitcoin is a free thinker. People that question reality. People that question the status quo? It doesn't matter if you're a conservative, libertarian, or a liberal. Those personality traits are present in everyone I've met who believes in Bitcoin

There is a giant risk this time around if the price gets too low. The 51% attack. There is so much hash power out there. Mining outfits are going to go out of business left and right if we crash. If that happens all that mining equipment is going to get used for something and it's going to become pretty inexpensive to attack various coins and even Bitcoin if the price goes low enough
That's the big difference between today and 2014. Back then there wasn't so much hash power
The other thing you should be wondering is if the price were to crash. Why exactly would that happen? There's no Mount gox this year. A crash would mean the people have just quit caring and threw in the towel. Maybe after a whole bunch of bullshit some people repair Bitcoin and try to relaunch it but it's going to be uphill struggle after all of the things that happened during that time. 
Personally I don't think anything like that is going to happen. I think the project tokens need to be eliminated from the market. I think they have been a major source of Fiat outflow. I think more new people will come to bitcoin if we can make it useful in Daily Society and potentially even if it just becomes a recognized store of value that the first world governments finally acknowledge
Bitcoin didn't go down to a dollar after 2013 and there's no reason to assume it's going to go down to a few hundred dollars this time around.

Yeah I remember all those betting sites saying Hillary was going to win too. 
I'm not sure why there are so many people in here who want to suck Trump off. Maybe they just like the taste of his nuts? You got me but the problem I see is if we continue on the path we are we are going to continually lose Global presence. We have become the laughing stock of the world. It's not even a Democrat or Republican thing to me. It's getting a leader that behaves like a leader. 
I also don't understand why you're getting misled by the hype on the left. That's just marketing. Some random art whatever that doesn't matter? Why would you even pay attention to that. There are only two issues on the left . education and health care. Everything else is noise. If you support easier access to college or even government-funded college so we stay competitive and healthcare for the population that would be it. There is only one issue on the right. Tax cuts for the wealthy. It's been that way for decades. Most everything else is noise. 
What bothers me about people like Alex Jones and the Fox News marketing campaign is they don't focus on what the core of the Republican agenda is. They focus on noise and things to get people emotional. Like the little bitches that down voted the last thing I said. They probably have more emotions than a four year old girl
Seriously, stop focusing on social bullshit. Remember there are two Core left issues and that is it . education and healthcare. If you're in Bitcoin you should realize the media does a really good job of getting people emotional and socially distracted. If you chose to vote against globalization which is pretty much what a vote for Hillary would have been you're going to have a hard time finding that with anyone else. We have been on the fast track to globalization ever since the 80s

Some exchanges let you trade on Leverage that means if you have one Bitcoin you can trade as much as a hundred Bitcoin. Very few people ever do this because if you have 100 Bitcoin worth of movement and only one Bitcoin worth of margin it takes very little price movement to wipe out your entire position. 
If someone had a hundred thousand Bitcoins and even used 10 or 20 x Leverage they could run the price past 10000 with no trouble. I haven't done the math to see how much it would actually take but I really doubt it would take their entire stack. The idea of course is to get people to fomo in and start buying so they can close out their positions at a profit and then eventually start selling more of their coins into higher prices

You're never going to get someone who is Fringe like McAfee elected. In fact I don't see how it would be socially positive. It might be good for Bitcoin but every other area of society I would worry about. There are people who forget where they put their shoes and can't even balance a checkbook. You bring in a Libertarian policy and those people are going to have a very bad day. That's going to lead to an increase in crime and an increase in homelessness along with many other issues. Bitcoin has grown just fine on its own and it will continue to grow. If it requires politicians and a bunch of polishing to make it successful it doesn't need to succeed. Good things rarely need active promotion

@_date: 2018-09-23 19:39:23
It's no different than cash. As the other guy is pointing out you were carrying around half a mil in cash. The funds should have went from The Ledger to an exchange directly and if you did not have the ledger you could have easily purchased another one if you were somewhere else.
At some point it sounds like your PC was compromised by some type of malware. Someone was definitely watching you. The thing that would be replaying through my brain it's what you did to become compromised
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:15:33
I picked up on that after reading a little bit more. I mean I guess it's a little late now but if you use your PC to download anything crypto related there's a chance some of it is malware. You could have got another Ledger, even a used one is perfectly secure if you reset it and generate a new seed or in your case upload your seed. Amazon even will sell the new Ledger s with free two-day shipping
If that was not an option and it was a large sum of money doing a fresh install of Windows would be something I would consider mandatory before putting that on my PC. I mean it takes what an hour or two to reload Windows? If you're talking over $10,000 and you have been at any risk it's pretty much one of those things I wouldn't think twice about

That was awhile ago. These funds just now started moving in the past couple weeks
This wallet also moved in 2014. Ross was in custody when it did
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:51:40
how far can you actually take it? that's a very large number of coins and being dormant for so long does give a person the vibe they may get used for selling. my 1st thought is that person would take up a large short position, wait for the market to start rolling over then dump his coins over the cliff. if he does so off the high he will be able to buy back even more with his short profits and where he sold. 
if other large holders are also in on this a coordinated move to 5k seems a logical strategy 
just seems really suspect so many coins started moving right as we crank up toward triple major resistance levels of the 200, the middle band [weekly] and the previous pivot at 8500
The bullish side would be if this is a fake out. If those coins are going to be used for margin and running the price up. But if that was the case why binance? The market does not expect prices to go up and break resistance which could trap a ton of shorts. If binance is a fake out and the leverage and buying is going to take place on bitfinex the majority of that wallet should be heading to bitfinex or bitmex
Also noteworthy a hundred million of new tether was just printed. That's oddly coincidental

@_date: 2018-09-03 03:28:11
You know what that means though. It means the tether are basically being bought on Leverage. I'm not sure how familiar you are with the American housing crisis in 2008 but a lot of that was leveraged money and what brought it down is when the volatility went outside their model. If they're going to do something similar with tether they can easily run that price up and if they're smart they can unwind it into the euphoria. If they are not. Good fucking God. Imagine Wile E Coyote in the old cartoons falling off the cliff. 
If they are really going to start a Euphoria cycle it's going to need to build for at least a year. I mean the first thing I would be looking for to see if this is actually going to happen is taking out the $8,500 pivot. That's literally Step 1 and the 200-day moving average is something like 78 to 7900 so if we can take out both of those you're going to turn a lot of people bullish
If someone has inside information about the SEC decision and it's positive. God it would be the perfect time to set up for this. You may notice when the SEC denied that entire basket of etf's the van Eck one was oddly absent

it does though. mining adds to the daily creation, buying trades fiat for existing
every day the number of btc goes up from mining. what you need are more people getting involved or more bought vs what's being mined. think of it like a big bucket of M&amp;Ms and there are a fixed amount in the bucket. if everyone wants one bidding goes up. having a small trickle of new M&amp;Ms does not increase the value. it actually decreases it by adding to supply. this is why halvings are so bullish

unless you have free or nearly free power these asics are door stops
you have to be on solar or hydro power @ .05 cents usd khw power or below to run an s9 profitably and this may not even last more than 6 months to a year.
the profitable ones like the e3 cost the same as a used rx580 rig which would have a LOT more resale and they hash about the same. the z9 is profitable now but expensive and may not be profitable long. future is in 7nm development. all the 16nm chips are....like i said, solar or hydro only and may not even be profitable long there.

Still 1:1 ratio with btc. 1 bch for each 1btc I own. Just in the off chance Hell Freezes Over and they actually make something out of that I want a nice hedge. If it burns to the ground the value is likely going to go into BTC so really either way I'm good

he's right. most of us know the chart patterns and when something becomes popular whales know where people will be and what they will be thinking. the majority do not expect a move to 10k by the end of the year which is why i think we may have exactly that
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:59:08
if you watch tweets from some VC funds more than a few have said " we have the checkbook ready but are not interested in the majority of the market" that of course means most alts are going to die and they are nibbling on btc and potentially others. baakt goes live in november, etf will probably happen next year. ltc halving next summer and btc the following year. timeline adds up really well for a market peak around 2021-2022 with the bull run starting sometime next year

1k trades all the time. 100k coins...that would have an effect. someone looking to move that many would probably do a discounted otc deal. on an exchange 100k coins hitting all at once would produce one hell of a red wick. not sure how low it would go. buy orders would be kicking off the whole way down from people with limit buys on the books. if i had to guess maybe 4k mid 4s but no one in their right mind would just market execute an order that size

This won't happen once you have been established. That said you're better off sending money to coinbase Pro and then you can set up limit buys. You save a small fortune on fees and you get a better price.
Once you have had your coinbase account for a few months they won't Place those holds but again you should just get used to coinbase pro. If you buy $100 worth of bitcoin on coinbase that $3 fee is 3%. Not only that but you pay a few dollars more for the Bitcoin . on coinbase Pro there is no fee on a limit buy. You also pay exact Market rates.

Yeah I think you're trying to connect dots that aren't really there man. Hillary led to the defeat of Hillary. I mean the Democrat party was so dumb they took the single person who the Republicans had been marketing against for over a decade and put them on the stage. They literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory
They could have taken a random senator from practically any blue State and put them on the stage and had a better turnout. A lot of the people on the right and especially the far-right hate Hillary and that makes them turn out to vote
The same thing is going to happen with 2020. Unless the Democrats do something obscenely stupid they are going to win the election with no problem. There are so many left-leaning people who just hate and I mean hate Trump they are going to turn out in droves to vote

When common people actually start using it everyday I'm going to be impressed. I suppose it's possible that the United States and Europe are going to be some of the last countries that actually see day-to-day use because we have so many other options. I'd buy and sell quite a few things and in this past year I've had one person pay with Bitcoin. The overwhelming majority are credit card or cash. 
It seems like the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin transactions are used to buy shitcoins. I guess that's not a bad way to start and it helps to make sure the network is functioning properly. The system just needs to become easier to use. For example, right now you have to send $100 to coinbase and from there you can load up your wallet. Or you can just use the same bank account you were going to buy the Bitcoin with and purchase what you want directly. Bitcoin ATMs make sense if they can get the fees down. Going after Western Union and putting them out of business makes sense because, well, Bitcoin is already in a position to take them on right now.

They even knew when. They start unloading an hour or two before it's published and then when people see the price falling and that article breaks everyone else Panic sells
Then the next day they say it's all fake news and was not accurate. Maybe Reuters should let us know who gave them the information for that article
Even more suspect is the timing around that Silk Road wallet. No one knows who owns that thing. If it was ever seized by the US government's and auctioned off there's a pretty good chance a very deep Pocket investment firm bought it. That wallet moved in 2014 which was after Ross went to prison. Not a hundred percent sure if there is a direct connection but that short interest went up like a madman all at once which is what you would expect from a single player putting on a large short position. Then you phone in the phony news and then you start the dump. There are so many bread crumbs pointing to this scenario

What hope does China really have of trying to murder Bitcoin? There are always ways around censorship. Even if they started figuring out how to track it people can move to Monero. I'm not the biggest fan of trump but he's dead right about China and the abusive trade policy. If he keeps the screws on them I can't imagine the situation getting better anytime soon for the Chinese government. The more people that come to realize what that article points out the more their house of cards is going to fall

I think this is true at least to a large degree but Society is beginning to question how many dimensions we really need to have in the multi-dimensional model. If we allow everyone we may as well allow Klan members and Nazis to express their point of view. And to a point we do actually allow that. There are blatantly racist websites like chimpout. That's what made me scratch my head about Alex Jones because he's really not the worst person out there. However he is poking the stick at some powerful politicians and powerful people. I honestly don't really know why he is doing some of the things he is. Maybe it's to try and get ratings or stir up a certain demographic?

i'm just going to point out what a fallacy this is. if btc needs to hit 4k or 3k in order to reverse why not 5k? or 2k? the youtube and twitter hype machines are in full effect but really...the goal of the big players is to separate you from your bitcoin. if a person wants to trade. cool. trade 10% of your stack but the actual amount of btc you hold should be increasing always if you are a patient person.

The question I have brought up in some of these debates is quite simply this. I'm very aware many of the news channels, especially Fox, run a lot of opinion pieces. The problem with some of the stuff is it is factually untrue. 
I don't think censorship is the correct approach. I think there need to be two distinct types of news media across the board. The first one has to go through a fact-checking process that the stations all agree on. Legitimate verified news. The second one can be opinion pieces and they need to be labeled as such or have a little tag in the bottom of the screen saying what they are. There are quite a few people who are not very smart that have all kinds of conspiracy theories that they have picked up online or from some TV show. It's not socially healthy to have people believing in things that are not true or accurate

main issue is the price is not keeping up with the hashing. miners are operating at break even right now making VERY little profit per day best case scenario. you start getting these 5700-6400 prices and miners even hodl. then they probably sell around 7500. if we don't get more demand this may continue for some time. daily mining production is substantial and they can absolutely put a floor under the coin if they don't sell.

sounds like everything will get rejected right? 
however then it points out that the futures are not developed to the point of an ETF. this is very true as the bitcoin futures volume is pretty low
i have no idea how anyone is suppose to prove a market is not manipulated. gold and silver certainly were. smaller stocks often are. ideally we find other positives to focus on because an ETF may not happen this go round. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:46:43
you have to because coins are awarded in blocks. the pools with the most hashpower literally make more guesses. if a large pool can make 10 million guesses per second and your small pool makes 50k guesses per second the chances of you ever finding a block and making any money are slim to none. people join pools to divy up the block reward. it makes earnings stable.

He doesn't comprehend a lot of it. He made a very obvious amateur mistake in the interview if you listen. He said Bitcoin is completely Anonymous and alluded to it being used by criminals and the government will never allow that. That's what people were saying 5 years ago but as we now know the government can very easily track Bitcoin and it's not anonymous. If it was actually a threat it would have been shut down way before it got to a 100 billion plus dollar market cap. If you watch a lot of TV interviews they always try and get somebody who has a negative view point and a positive view point to make a show. If they were able to get Obama and Trump in the same room believe you me they would love to make a TV show about that. Having these two conflicting points of view gets ratings and it's how they make TV

the miners could easily setup shop elsewhere. most that hashpower isn't bitmain. it's outside miners pooling for the luck probability 
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:25:31
i actually found out a bit more about all this last night and now it all makes sense. the reason they are gunning for an IPO right now isn't to get max value it's to corner the market. many smaller miner production shops will fail. they can't produce miners at competitive prices. bitmain will be able to buy them up for pennies on the dollar and be even more dominating than they already are. this is a rockefeller play on the crypto mining industry. this is why they want to raise so much more money. take over the competition before 7nm is mainstream. if successful they will make obscene amounts of money in the next bull run and likely pump the holy hell out of bch in order to lighten up into the cycle

depends on how it plays out. if bitmain were going to dump the 1st thing they would do is back up the truck and build a large large short position in bch and ltc. when that waterfall goes it's likely to bring bitcoin down with it. i still think that whole event has a very very low probability of actually happening. they are much MUCH better off to band aid together and sell into the next bull market rather than further collapse a bear market

I think it's worth keeping an eye on those guys just to see how they are marketing. In the past couple weeks there have been a couple of really big red flags. The first one was a week or two ago Rodger said bitmain could unload all of that bcash and it would have no real effect on the market because of how strong and how much demand there is for said bcash
This week his tone of voice almost sounds like he's being interviewed by the police and they have something. It's worried. There is a lot of stress in the way he pronounces words. Even alludes to a major problem happening in Taiwan if they don't come to an agreement and then tries to downplay it. If it's hard for you to watch all of his marketing propaganda those are the main core points

friendly update on mining profitability. a 14t/h s9 is making .00055btc day. on .05kwh power which is only availble in limited industrialized places it would cost 2.02/ day power. net production cost of 1btc is $3656usd in the best case scenario NOT counting rent, employees, broken miners etc. real production cost is probably closer to 5k in highly efficient farms. keep this in mind when people start calling for btc 3k. around 5k it's extremely likely miners will reduce daily selling which limits the daily inflation. again, this is best case scenario. many mining outfits have a production cost around where we are currently trading in the 6s

@_date: 2018-08-14 20:52:26

@_date: 2018-08-26 20:22:45
there are some old emails that were leaked from late 2016 when the plans for bch were being discussed. make no mistake. taking down bitcoin WAS their goal. it was to be flipped for bch and they went all in. bitmain holds very little btc compared to the bch and before this date they almost certainly held a TON of btc. they sold off the btc to try and suppress the price and used the funds to pump btc. if you ever go over to r/btc and wonder why they sound like religious extremists...well..it's because they are. you have the standard sock puppets and you have a few zelots. again, make no mistake. they don't want to live side by side with btc. the only one in that camp who might is jihan wu if we believe his tweets. they left him holding the bags with bch so it's possible he may want out to some degree.

no one does this, not over and over. society is envious, jealous, hateful. do you really expect us to believe you're white knighting to save people from the big bad bitcoin?
why not save people from polluted cities? drinking too much soda? smoking cigs or weed daily? being obese? you know things that are actually harmful. bitcoin is speculative. we get that., so far every single person who bought in roughly 95% of the time it has traded has made money. a select few have lost buying in this year if they sold at a lower price. however, the majority of society is stupid. VERY stupid. they chase trends and buy when they should be selling and sell when they should be buying.
why do i not see posts from you in december warning people about this? why now after a 70% correction ? is it possible that you may be an emotional trend follower&gt;? hmmm
also keep in mind many of us are aware of paid fudsters and fomo hypers who do the bidding of their masters. it's ridiculously suspect that the sub is flooded with "run for the hills" posts whenever there is a drop

it promotes panic selling. as the other guy pointed out when people see massive sell orders they want to jump in front of them. it encourages people to sell lower and lower. if you watch really close you will see 50-100 btc orders that have been stair stepping down the past couple days and they never go through. market runs down a few dollars, they pull them and put them back up, rinse and repeat
this has to happen. too many people have this ridiculous idea of a 90% alt correction and btc around 5k. the market will recover quicker if it just happens and we are done with it

this is happening. a private group i belong too has a couple people in the industry who chat from time to time. large block orders are firing off on the OTC buy side as funds look to build positions. since bitcoin has a fixed supply cornering the market is possible. if a handful of funds own 70-80% of the coins the price can be whatever and it doesn't matter. the public does one thing. they chase gains. once key players have 100k coins each or more you can bring the price up to 50k 100k 500k it doesn't matter. what matters is the 100k coins they paid 5k for get sold for 50k, 60k, 70k etc as they scale out on the way up. there is also a plan b. if you guys watch FOREX many countries have had radical drops against the usd in the past 3 months. like north of 10% and these aren't just shit countries. brazil, russia etc. if this continues they will be looking for hedges in multiples places  
everyone is freaking out about 6800 cracking on the pullback. it happened on a saturday on really light volume. broken chart patterns get people to panic and dump. if a fund has a goal of buying as much as they can at a low cost pushing the market down on key levels can trigger sell waves. the million dollar question right now is will they push hard through the 5300-5700 area and aim for the next major support which is 3200-3700. it's one hell of a gamble to short that heavy and if you own enough coins to do it there's no guarantee you will profit from doing so as people buy the open market. you could very well be buying your old coins back at a higher price. the real money is on the upside. get people euphoric again. when the guy working at 7-11 spends his whole check on bitcoin and euphoria sets in across the public we will see some real gains. that process will take a few years but it all starts with and end to the lower lows

it use to be their goal and was one of the main reasons bch was born. it was going to be marketed as bitcoin without the fees and if btc would have stayed at $40 transaction fees they would have had a real argument. i have no idea what the plan is now. they can't really dump without collapsing the market and killing market trust. they may just let it trade and shift marketing to something else like next gen 7nm miners. bitmain also has a ton of litecoin that would be hard to get off of in a bear market...in fact....it's possible they have been selling come to think of it. litecoin sold off hard vs btc in the past 90 days

There still is no actual evidence that the tether was created out of thin air. What I remember about December is everyone and their dog was throwing real dollars at crypto. I remember people meeting in parking lots with stacks of hundred dollar bills to buy video cards. Coinbase was trying to sign up 50,000 people a day.
Another thing worth considering is this. If tether was really a scam. Why didn't they keep it going? Why didn't they keep the price higher to sell into?
If that still doesn't make you wonder consider how many millions of dollars a month the exchanges make keeping the wheels turning. If tether was a scam it's in their best interest to make it Square. If it was not a scam then things are just as they appear. I know it's easy to jump and assume everything is a scam because there are so many scams in crypto but we just don't have any evidence on this one. We just have speculation. There are also reasons why bitfinex may not want to have an audit. Where those US Dollars come from and the American government could lead to some pretty serious tax evasion charges I suspect. There is a reason they want to keep where the money is coming from Secret

the argument they keep making at the sec about "manipulated markets" while probably true are also manipulated and have been in the past with gold and silver. OTC stocks. hell some small cap stocks. oil futures, AG futures. shit farmers can band together and reduce production on corn to raise the price. whales do that in bitcoin and the SEC magically has an issue?

they don't have 51% of the hashpower. it's a novice view of the statistics. people see their pools at 51% but bitmain does not control them. each pool has thousands of miners linked up. they can flip a switch and it's game over even if they did go hostile. 
some private emails surfaced where bitmain / wu was discussing the flipping. they had ideas for it but they never executed. the idea was btc fees would stay high and they could get some public adoption. the market shit the bed before any of this had a chance to happen. now with LN development and retail crypto fiat purchases down like 90% bitmain has bags...big bags and they already sold the most valuable ones {btc}

would work but would also require getting your hands on them at the factory AND it would only work once. when new user A noticed he deposited said coin and does not have said coin it's game over. spoofing deposits might get your scam further ahead but all would be revealed on the first transfer out which most smart people try on day 1

it's heading that way. you need to be paying 4 to 5 cents per kwh if you do this large scale. smaller miner {like me} pay .10 per kwh which is a major disadvantage on the large scale. small scale it isn't, i do it in my house, i have no employees etc. large scale however, like 1-2btc a month plus you HAVE to have that low power cost. small industrial offices can be rented for as little as 700-1000usd / mo in some cities with low power costs. those guys can scale up and push me out of the market. it is heading that way. there is risk though. if you pay 1k a month rent you likely have 200k+ in equipment and 1 employee or yourself. that's the price of a small house or damn near you're risking. if bitcoin goes into a prolonged bear market you're F*ked 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:09:56
I don't really think it will either. Looking at the cost of Mining and looking at the general mentality of people.
But there's always someone saying it's going to go down to $1,000. The part I find the absolute most ridiculous about it is that tone keeps comparing today to 2014. Okay well we also have to look at 2013 and 2017 if you're going to do that. There was a much greater percentage increase in 2013 and not only that the market started at $20 in January. Saying that we are going to go back to the beginning of 2017 this time around didn't even happen the last time around
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:07:08
This is the first time that we have had investment funds and venture capital in the market though. They didn't really participate in the 2013 run up. In fact the 2013 run-up was completely manipulated by a couple of bots.
Personally I think we're in a little bit of no-man's-land when trying to determine the bottom or how the next Bull Run will begin. We have had a fundamental level change with institutional money and with people believing in Bitcoin this time around. In 2014 and 2015 70% of the market was Mount gox. When that blows up and people lose everything. You're just never going to get that level of pessimism again today without a couple of things happening. One of them would be if the worst case scenario of tether comes to happen. The other one would be if a major exchange went down and was hacked or the owners ran off with all the money or something like that

Jihan is the only one in that camp who might be having second thoughts as you can tell and some of his tweets. However if you search some of the archives here in Reddit you will be able to find the emails that I talk about. They are from late 2016 and they are internal. Someone leaked them. There is a popular meme video going around right now about Bitcoin cash. There are jokes made about operation Dragonslayer. I'm not 100% sure if that's what they called it but it wouldn't surprise me if it is correct. They 100% wanted to kill Bitcoin and promote their new product. I think many of them still do only they are coming to realize it's not going to happen so now it's damage control and what comes next. 
If the pressure gets too intense they are going to turn on each other and run for the door. The question is just who is going to unload first? Jihan or roger?

All I know is there have to be things going on that are not public. With the hashrate that you can buy over the table and what it will cost you to operate it's really not that profitable at today's prices and even less so when you look at the difficulty ramp going forward.

it was, they even pointed it out. the futures do not have enough volume to handle an etf currently. too few contracts  
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:19:51
i could have likely worded it better. it's how much usd or eur is needed to push the market cap price up $1. most articles point to a few cents but i have never actually seen a study on it. if that is the case you could move markets with a few millions dollars. 
the break on saturday of 6800 appears to me to be one of those manipulated events. low weekend volume. took very little to break a key support level. even more curious is the price we are trading at. if you look at the chart of issued tether  and when it went into full blown auto-print mode it was right around the $6k price. there was a dip at the start of november and then.....it was like not so fast. turn on the money machine. see that 6 week period from nov-17 to mid jan-18? little different than all the rest of history. market peaks within 2 weeks of their subpoena....just a bit much there 
now i'm starting to suspect it's being manipulated on the way down
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:44:52
the thing that makes bitcoin "less risky" is this. you can corner the market. the entire market cap of bitcoin is half the the airplane maker boeing and less than half of intel. this is if we take the 100b bitcoin value at face fiat usd value which we all know is not the case since margin is in there and tether may or may not be straight. depending on who you ask the actual usd cap on bitcoin could be much much lower. every hear $1 in fiat equals $10 in market cap? this is what they mean.

One thing that really has them backed into the corner is 7 nanometer is not ready for production yet. All of their current miners are not profitable for practically everyone unless you have five cent power.

i see just the opposite. people set up shorts then drop large bricks. the followers follow and they buy back in at a lower price. they just keep finding resistance around that 5700-6300 zone.
if this cycle is going to downleg there needs to be a catalyst. 2014 had two major catalysts. 2018 has 1 rumor with the 6 week period of unnatural tether behavior nov1 to mid jan. if we are going to have a 2nd leg down capitulation cycle something has to cause it. we aren't going to test 3200 on bear euphoria
just looking at the news everything is really good. most in the know realize the etf is a question of IF not when. as long as that is the case you have limited downside ammo from further delays 
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:38:48
yea i don't really buy that urban myth. late 2017 when the price when crazy people were downright euphoric.   
bitcoin does move in cycles, this much is apparent. people go through the emotional rollercoaster. each rally and correction are different. people keep looking at 2014, this is not 2014, it's 2018. it will be different. no market ever plays out exactly the same. we lost of a LOT of speculative gambling money this year.

Something doesn't add up honestly. Either next-generation miners are already going or you have a bunch of people playing the game of chicken. Expenses included the cost of production is in the fives even if you have some of the cheapest power in the modern world. 
On the one hand I want to say if we have a draw down to 5000 some of these people are going to be in the House of Pain. On the other if we do have a drawdown to 5000 a lot of them are likely not going to sell their daily coins which puts a soft floor under the price

you're right. large holders not only look at the books they know where support levels are and most stop losses are within 10% of support. large margin shorts or selling can push the price down triggering a sell wave
the same is done on the way up. multiple large accounts going margin long and buying all the low hanging fruit can quickly walk up limit ask prices and rally the price.
the public just chases. the euphoria stage will start next time when bitcoin takes out 20k and turns it into a support level. no idea how many months / years that will be but history will repeat. people are predictable
it takes less actual money than many people suspect to move markets. 100 whales in a syndicate that all market buy 1m usd of btc at the same time would create a candle you couldn't even imagine

@_date: 2018-08-27 18:38:19
Personally I think it is just that the cycle has to work through itself. Maybe it's manipulation, maybe it's people suppressing the market to try and accumulate low. It is kind of suspect the price keeps stopping just above production cost as to not compromise the Integrity of the mining structure. Every time the market rallies we are rejected by the 200-day moving average on the couple times we have gotten close to it. Until we see higher highs and higher lows there are going to be a lot of people on the sidelines just waiting it out
Realistically if this trend continues you're going to wind up in a tone vays situation as the price continues to stair step down. That's the worst case scenario that I see

This is what confident Roger sounds like
It's not what I've been seeing from him lately via video. Especially when he's talking about Taiwan or when he's talking about bitmain and all of their Bitcoin cash and the effect it would have on the market. Saying you could dump 1 million coins on the market and it would have no real effect was a terrible lie to tell. I think that was in the video before the one we are discussing. it was a couple weeks ago. The thing about telling an obvious lie on video is it lets everyone know what you look and sound like when you're lying.
Guy used to be such a positive influential force on bitcoin. Just sad to see it have turned out like this
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:07:45
friendly advice. if you have any bcash just for the lolz like i do you might consider leaving a portion or all on an exchange with a stop loss in place. if this bitmain situation really goes south and  real dump happens. well....the world's largest red candle may become a reality.
* side note. if you happen to be good with reading the tone of someone's voice, listen to the very latest video roger put up on youtube. i can hear the fear in his voice. his normal boasting is shaky. he's trying to put on his regular bitcoin cash is  pitch but he's worried. listen to how the words are pronounced

That when you look at the amount of hashrate out there historically and you look at the price there is a correlation. If you look at the hashrate last year when we were at the same price it was just miles lower
This can be somewhat of a problem going forward because miners are unprofitable right now in all but the lowest cost power environments.
Last year when we were at this same price each terahash got you a hell of a lot more Bitcoin
To the best of my knowledge 7nm is not ready yet. That means all of the existing minors are basically boat anchors because like I said they are not profitable to operate for the vast majority of people

I don't blame you guys for supporting this but you have to stay rooted in reality and realize it may never happen in your lifetime.
What you can do is acquire real assets like land and gold and I'm definitely pushing for Bitcoin, but again if we are honest it's only a 10 year old asset that needs to be proven before we can put it on the same playing field as gold when it comes to store of value
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:37:58
i think the big picture is you have two different camps battling with each other. one group who believes 2k is a certainty and wants to dump convinced they can buy back in down there. another group who believes we made a bottom on the 200 week sma and now we are in an accumulation period thus "buy the dip" when people unload 
i'm 50/50 on this one as i could see the 2k situation playing out when traditional markets face the music with slowing gdp and some of these massive bets on everything being just fine blow up. this would be a very unconventional bear market in bitcoin and i'm not sure how it will play out...bitcoin has never been in a global crisis before as it was born out of the big one. 
what am i personally doing? stopped shorting over the past couple weeks. it's not longer a free lunch. adding a bit more on dips but not heavily buying. we need to take out the pivot at 4200 and close weekly candles above it for the bullish case to really be in play. however, recent action has taken me from bearish to neutral in the near term.   
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:14:40
There is no real reason it would have to imitate the past exactly. If you look at developed economies like the biggest one in the United States the debt-to-gdp keeps growing. Eventually it's going to be a problem. I don't know what the magic number is going to be but this is going on across the world. Europe is even worse. Some type of debt forgiveness program would get countries growing again. How they get the details worked out I'm not really sure, the only thing I would bet on is the hard assets would not be included
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:58:45
Neither. Just saying that is what happened and that is the situation we have in front of us. The amendment as it was written says shall not infringe . well it's already been infringed and that's the law that did it. Again, like I said now Society is just trying to find the boundaries
I don't really have a specific personal opinion. I like going to shoot guns. I don't really see the Democrat angle as a threat to that. The only thing I see them arguing for is stricter rules. If I have to go do an interview with the sheriff or file a piece of paper. Pre purchase ..well ..if that saves a kid's life it's a pretty good trade

Well, let me just refer you to some of this. Take a read. It really goes far beyond them and their real Bitcoin propaganda. 
See what I mean? The leadership of bch are nothing more than common criminals. 
There is a new generation of people coming into crypto and it bothers me when I see them being taken advantage of by this crowd 
I'm yet another person who has been banned from their subreddit and in all fairness I did troll the living shit out of them. However. It's the same way I would heckle a child molester if I saw him camping outside a kindergarten with a pair of binoculars. 
They are predatory people 
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:49:28
definitely a disconnect between price action and fundamentals. that can go for a time but eventually fundamentals are what drive markets. hard to even argue TA at this point. i mean...realistically, sure the 2k scenario can happen, i just don't see it as likely as some unless, and this is the big unless. if traditional markets fall apart and hedge funds are forced to liquidate for margin in other assets they may unload bitcoin in the holdings. how much they have is anyone's guess and we also don't know what kind of deep pockets are lying in wait to defend the 3100 bottom. in short the 2k argument may never happen even if we have a global slowdown
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:56:53
I think that is really pushing it because $10 on a thousand is only 1% which is better than Visa but it's also the upper threshold of what the market is going to tolerate. As we all know visa gives some pretty amazing deals to large merchants. They also offer fraud protection and other centralized services. A decentralized product that functions basically like cash has to be substantially cheaper
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:55:44
When has the Gov ever seized land from someone in Western Europe, Canada, America, or Australia? Because I watched the price of land double just in the past 10 years and with current policy it's going to keep going. The other thing about land is you can actually live in a house on it which means you don't have to pay rent to someone else
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:51:38
Isn't that kind of the nature of the market? Bitcoin dominance almost certainly is somewhere around 80% and if you add in other coins like Litecoin and either you're probably around low-90s leaving the thousands of other tokens to scramble over the couple percent left.
I would imagine exchanges are the same way with binance, coinbase, kraken. Deribit, finex and mex making up the overwhelming majority of actual trade
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:05:17
It's a problem and it's not. You guys are probably aware of the problem so I'm just going to fast forward to the not. What am I arguing? The rest of the world. The reason the debt in the United States is not as big of a deal as it looks at first glance is because the rest of the world is actually worse.  If you look at a chart of the US dollar Index it's actually been gaining strength and even with the feds signaling a very dovish policy it has not sold off. 
Basically they can continue the house of cards for decades at a minimum. What's going to happen is hard assets are going to rise faster than wages. You're going to see the price of land, homes, gold etc all rise in step. It's basically a way to allow the banks to control pricing, inflate away the debt, and make people feel like they're making more money even though everything they buy costs more. Some of you who are a little older might remember this when we went from very good prices in the late 90s and by the Year 2007 absolutely everything was so much more expensive. 
I know a lot of us have at least one Bitcoin but I highly suggest you get your hands on some land and at least an ounce of gold for every Bitcoin you have. Diversify the hard assets because they all are going to rise
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:18:58
When you go convince the majority of the population of that we will have something to talk about. Until then you know what people do? They vote one side or the other and the spending goes somewhere. you just have to choose where you want it to go

They would likely be the ones to benefit the most. If World governments ever decide on something like that the hard assets are definitely going to get divvied up. Once the debt is Forgiven you can have some pretty outrageous growth again.

possible but unlikely. people have been worried about this for years and we keep growing. worst part is the scams and ponzi's. plus token did some damage to this cycle and it wouldn't surprise me if that guy is panic selling the rest of his stack. keep in mind miners dump 54,000 btc every month right now so just to stay even that has to be absorbed. add in panic selling, plus token etc. sellers are just running and those of us adding are doing so slowly on the way down looking for a big wick or base to signal a bottom

That's the same conclusion I came to. I mean I used to have fun trolling the living shit out of those guys until they finally Banned Me from r/btc but nothing good ever comes out of dealing with them. On the one side you have the obvious scammers and on the other you have the idiots falling for it. Not a lot of good you're going to do there

I don't see how there won't be one. Even if the United States which currently has the strongest economy of the developed nations does not have a GDP recession it's definitely going to have an earnings recession. Europe, Canada and Australia are looking worse. 
Really no matter which way you argue it I don't see how we are going to get away from lower interest rates at the fed and ECB when the Slowdown becomes obvious and they are forced to stimulate

Can you even imagine a reset to a gold standard. If they wiped out all of the global debt like the debt Jubilee thesis the price of gold would go up and up. I mean you might be talking at least 5 to $10,000 an ounce.  The really crazy part is if this happened we would at least have a stable monetary system going forward
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:51:46
Gold still has a use. Think about what it represents. Trust... It's finite. It's history
Think about how much better the situation with World fiat currency would be if it was all still on the gold standard
If you look at a $20 coin from the late 1800s it was an ounce of gold. Think about that one for a minute
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:31:00
It really doesn't matter that much because they can always have a debt Jubilee if things get out of hand. If you look at Forex the US dollar is actually pretty strong compared to everything on the planet. If we were to reduce the debt and strengthen the dollar it would make American Goods extremely expensive for the rest of the world to buy. 
That market is going to do what it's going to do and that is inflate hard assets. It's the whole reason we own bitcoin. It's why buying land and gold is also a good idea. You want the real assets

Well it just depends on what definition of free we are going to use because each time a president tries to run they promise people something.  From what I can tell this far-left push we have seen really getting some steam behind it is heavily based in people under 30 and especially under 25. They look at the price of a house and they look at the price of a lot of hard assets and then they look at wages and think I'm never going to be able to afford this. They see a $15 an hour job and $1,200 a month rent on a one-bedroom apartment. Compared to the 90s when I was a kid it's definitely worse today. When you talk about open freedom and all of that the first thing they think of is, if everything was wide-open the rich people would just exploit me more. They aren't wrong either, that's what happened around the turn of the 20th century. 
There is a balancing act between libertarianism and personal freedoms along with allowing people to have a decent standard of living. Without rules and regulations the elite would rule even more hardcore than they currently do

Yeah, I mean I get where you're coming from there is just one question. If we had a truly free Society and someone wanted a job what would stop all of those with money from paying as little as possible for the help? That's exactly what we had around the turn of the 20th century when we did have more or less a fully libertarian Society. Those that had money wanted that because they could thrive in it. I don't disagree that a lot of the regulation and rules benefits them but getting rid of the rules is certainly not going to help us. It will just give them an open door to exploit
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:28:11
We tried that argument around the late 1890s and into 1900. Big businesses formed syndicates and created their own minimum wage. It was basically as low as possible. You ever watch that History Channel show The Men Who Built America? That's how it was
I don't really know what the correct answer is because the wealthy exploited then, they are exploiting now. I'm just sitting back and watching the cards fall and what I see is a very hard left push. I think the elites brought this on themselves. We have watched the top 1% gain more power and more land and more wealth while the bottom 50% has gotten less. People are going to push back and maybe over the coming decades we will find an equilibrium. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 04:56:57
Lol. I know right. The screen shot I could create of that ban must be somehow fabricated. 
Actually you probably don't even need to do that they have open mod logs so you can see all the people they have been Banning. 
Then of course they get on video saying they never do that because they know most people aren't going to check and it fits their bullshit narrative.
I mean is anyone really surprised scammers are not exactly honest?
@_date: 2019-11-25 08:08:19
Well, it wasn't like they didn't do their homework I mean the majority of this rally we had was pushed by plus token and then we had traders jumping on top of it.
When that Ponzi collapsed and the founders started dumping thousands of Bitcoin per day on the market then you had the chart breakdown it all kind of added up to a good short
The thing is those guys at plus token can't have much left and they are all on the run which means they want to liquidate and go somewhere safe and hide. 
That selling is going to be exhausted and we are going into a halving. There will be a supply restriction next year just like there is an overhead of Supply right now. Take advantage of the opportunity while it's in front of you

Do you want to own one? As you have pointed out the price fluctuates. In order to get one someone has to be selling one and how they feel and how many they have and a whole host of other things like Chinese ponzi's influence the price. 
There really aren't that many of these things for sale. The plus token Ponzi accumulated just under 200,000 Bitcoin and look what it did to the price on the way up. That's what I mean about not many for sale

Right now, the most popular narrative is just another asset where people can independently store their wealth. Kind of like gold only with a few modern perks. It's a lot easier to transport. It's easier to sell. It cannot be counterfeited. Which in all fairness you can't counterfeit gold either but you can fake it and some of the fakes are rather hard to detect
Bitcoin just needs more time and as it ages more and more people begin to trust it and learn about it.
I mean if we just discovered gold in 2009. It's hard to imagine it being worth more than a few dollars an ounce right now.

I think I'm going to translate the majority of comments. It goes something like this.

@_date: 2019-11-02 19:54:57
You made a really good bullet point narrative to go off of. It pretty much nut shells our current situation which is why it's so curious people expect the stock market to crash. I think they are completely wrong because the crash is pretty much what you outlined. The very currency itself is what is likely to enter a bear market, not the assets. 
Like Ray I also don't know where people are going to flock but I would heavily suggest that people try to accumulate at least one Bitcoin. At least a couple ounces of gold. Some money in global powerhouse companies like Google or Microsoft. Own some real estate in an area with low unemployment and see where we go
You want to own assets, not boatloads of Fiat
@_date: 2019-11-30 05:24:19
Is that actually a gold one? I haven't found anyone that has made Solid Gold Bitcoin coins. I have a solid silver one but it just isn't quite the same
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:49:10
It doesn't, the idea is getting your money in harder assets so if the Fiat depreciates the assets are pushed higher
It actually brings up another point about the Doom and Gloom crowd who thinks the stock market is going to crash. I think they have it 180 degrees off. They are completely wrong this time. All of the evidence is pointing to the crash this time happening in the very currencies themselves. You want to own land and you want to own the gold and you probably even want to own the stocks. It's the very dollars that are going to be under pressure this time if we do have some kind of Crisis or just ongoing easy money policy

That is a dangerous game because the miners would shut down and there is a risk of central banks buying up all the cheap gold
Bitcoin is a little easier right now because most people in the know are aware of what plus token did on the way up. When that collapsed and it became pretty obvious 200,000 Bitcoin were going to be liquidated in short order. Well it would be like someone that had  tons of gold just unloading. It would temporarily suppress price. Miners are dumping up to 54k btc/mo and plus had 200k btc which they have been liquidating since July. If you're looking to build a big position you just step out of the way and let them liquidate. As we get towards the end of it which is where we are now you start a long position. There's pretty much no way plus token has more than 20% of their funds left and it's probably more like 5 to 10% it's even possible this drop we just had was them Panic selling the rest of it I mean who knows
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:49:15

I want to type something like Darwin Award after reading this. 
I mean how do you buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin and have so little knowledge of how Bitcoin operates? One of the first things I did before I even had $50 of Bitcoin is learn about wallets and Recovery. Spent about eight hours listening to Andreas Antonopoulos and coming to understand how it operated. 
Your Google Authenticator also will not transfer when you switch phones. Big picture you should be glad that Bitcoin doesn't transfer because if it did it would mean your seed was in an easily accessible part of your phone and the potential for hacking would be high.
I'm just thinking that over the years all of the countless threads I have seen on here about all of the various ideas on how we keep our backup phrases. Did that just not click? I mean it's an expensive lesson learned and I've done stupid shit in my past just the same. I really hope you will learn from it and apply more thought to every part of your life.

american media is keeping people too distracted arguing over their favorite reality show candidate to notice actual facts like that.

@_date: 2019-11-30 08:58:34

It's the ultimate next big wave but it might take years to really develop. When someone can easily buy Bitcoin on Fidelity or TD Ameritrade there's going to be a large amount of money flowing in. Ideally this would be an ATF but who knows maybe they come up with some other strategy.
The problem we keep having is just there is such a large number of scumbags in crypto. This plus token Ponzi messed up the price action. We had a ton of by volume and it's hard to say when they will be done dumping

Jm bullion or apmex for gold or silver. As for Real Estate it's literally the best investment a young person can make more times than not. Why is that you might ask? Because it's a leveraged trade with limited risk. That doesn't exist anywhere else.
With an FHA loan you only have to put 3.5% down. That's your risk, you get all of the upside of the appreciation of hundreds of thousands of dollars with only a couple thousand dollars down .on top of that you don't have to pay rent anymore. If someone would have bought their first home back in 2010 for 175k. It would have been about a 5k down payment or risk. The same house would be worth about 400,000 today. 225k profit on that 5000 risk

You know why Bitcoin is truly important to me. It's because I have , well not a lot compared to some of you but enough to buy a car on the blockchain.

@_date: 2019-11-30 05:26:05

100% agree. I think it's a great idea to spend on education and health care for the population but we absolutely have to make Cuts elsewhere to balance the budget. If we just spend and spend and spend all it is going to do is devalue Fiat further and make the purchase price of goods more expensive.

What exactly do you mean by out of nowhere, they broadcast that move months ahead of time.
What the media says caused the sell-off reaction is when they said hikes were going to continue on autopilot. Had that continued it would have brought on a recession sooner rather than later. The FED made a good move for the economy by reversing course. They may have prevented another 2009 level crash but we're definitely going to have an earnings recession this year and could very easily have a 2001 type slow bleed until they begin to stimulate and earnings begin to increase which at the earliest is going to be 2020. 
If anyone's having trouble keeping up with this the nutshell version is looking earnings in 2018. They were fucking stellar. You're not going to have year-over-year increase from that level but if it's bad this year you can have year over year increase in 2020 which would be acceleration

The fact the second word out of your mouth was knows has me wondering what you were reading? It's a probability system. There are a couple of popular ways to use it including trend-following, pivots and patterns but honestly this year it hasn't really been that great with Bitcoin if that's all you're Trading. What's been in play on the way up was just throw your money at the screen and on the way down that upper trend line has been the only really useful ta indicator.
If you watched successful Traders like Eric or Jacob they have a system where they get into a trade very close to where they are know they are wrong. If it goes that way they are immediately out of the trade but if it goes in their Direction they win a lot more than the potential loss.
I think the biggest influence on price this year can be summed up in two words and those are plus token

Except you can't get an easy $100. You could look at the price of alt coins and go there but you really could only look at eth or Litecoin since you will need volume to get back out when you bring it back to coinbase period on top of that I haven't checked but I would imagine those two are also selling at a premium. There is no Fiat Gateway on the other exchanges that have the high prices to go to US dollars

LOL totally same here. When I made my first Hardware wallet not only did I write down the seed but I made sure there was only $5 of Bitcoin in the wallet.

It's hard to imagine someone who doesn't want to test the recovery process before they add large amounts of money

A lot of us still keep accumulating. We just get tired of talking about it. At these prices I still buy at least .01 per week. I didn't even get into this Market until late last year.

I think a lot of it is because the human mind is genetically programmed to identify patterns. Now add that in with a substantial portion of the population that is untrusting of anything new. You may notice how a lot of the country is very traditional and they stick to these values that sometimes don't even make sense. Those two psychological events make Bitcoin a really hard sell. First they see the pattern and they see other things in the past that claimed to generate money out of nothing. that's how they view it and in the past they know how that goes. Second, Fiat money has been the backbone of the economy for generations.  It works, they can see it working they don't really give it much thought beyond that. 
The personality type I see that is attracted to bitcoin typically are either extremely untrusting of government or extremely progressive thinkers.  I don't put a lot of weight on tradition. If something makes sense I go with it regardless of what the previous generations did. I realized the pattern recognition part of my brain does not dictate every event in life. I own Bitcoin

Historically the best thing a person can do with Bitcoin is buy it and forget they own it. Revisit in a few years.

The original comment was about gab being a platform for hate speak. Which it is.

The funny thing about racists is most of them don't admit they are racist or nationalists unless they are around other people they are sure feel the same way. It's either that or you just generally believe people should be able to say whatever they want regardless of the consequence. If that's the case what do you think about yelling bomb on a plane?

What does that have to do with Bitcoin again? If it's some kind of Second Amendment statement that was already decided in the 60s or 70s when we passed felon in possession.

Teaching people how to think is exactly what needs to happen and why education is so important. If people are struggling so hard they can't even barely put food on the table. Well it's really easy to convince them that there is some other person keeping them down. That's how the alt-right markets. Critical thinking like how do we figure out if something is or is not true. Many of them lack that specific skill set and I will point to examples. Just a few weeks ago a bill got passed and Trump was on TV saying that it barely happened and the Democrats were objecting. Well if you actually look at the vote count most all of the Democrats voted for it because it was a decent idea. Why would he lie about such a thing that is so easily fact-checked? He knows people aren't going to look into it. He knows his followers get fired up when he tells them the left is destroying their way of life. They are standing in the way of all of their progress.

It's possible we avert an actual GDP recession this time but an earnings recession is pretty much a certainty. There is no possible way that we will have accelerated growth in 2019 over the 2018 levels.

So just to clarify you're arguing that giving away money to these businesses with massive tax breaks and kickbacks is why the US is successful? Sometimes it's outright grants.
Second can you please explain how I am a communist?
Third how would privatized education benefit us? I went to a private school. It cost my parents $30,000 a year. How many people can afford that again? Think how broad of a level it would be with the entire country trying to go to privatize schools. You would have one of a couple things happen. Runaway costs or you would have to try to contain it with low wages which would drastically lower the quality of Education. How exactly is that better than the current system? Can you actually argue this without insults and personal attacks?
Healthcare would be in an extremely similar situation. The number one area of interest in healthcare is the outrageous profit the drug manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies are making. They are selling drugs in America for anywhere between 10 and 1000 times what the retail price in many other countries for the exact same drug are. Multiple politicians have tried to call them out on this. Obama did. Trump did. Neither one of them have done anything. Why do you think that might be?

On top of that you have to quickly take your profit when it does happen and also deal with the losses of false breakouts and breakdowns

Have you looked at why some of that division is there? You're supposed to hate someone in the left because they want more government money for education or Healthcare? I mean those are the two main major points on the left.
The response from the right is don't take from me. Yet they support policies that are highly inflationary. It makes no sense.
People are a product of their environment which is true and I guess you could argue that we have all had some degree of propaganda burned in our brains. Society since the beginning of time has functioned under rules and regulations in one way or another. The way I look at a lot of things is will I benefit or will Society benefit. If it's yes to both I generally support it. This is why I don't like a lot of what the right is putting out. When I asked that same question about many of their projects only a select few benefit and those select few already have more than almost everyone. On the social side I see tribalism. I don't see any difference between people of any color or any religion. We are all born the same. This is again the problem I have with the right. 
Division is definitely not the right answer. Division leads to Wars and a continuous cycle of turmoil. Even more curious is how people will agree with something if it comes from whatever Camp they think they belong to. If Trump got on TV and made some talking points you would have a whole bunch of Republicans agreeing with it. If Obama got on TV and made the same point they would hate it. That's not a functional Society. That's a tribal Society
Crypto still has not caught on anywhere near mainstream. When I can buy cars and homes and even my groceries easily with it and also get paid with it we might have something. That might happen in the future. It's not here just yet though. If real conservatives want to make a smaller government this is definitely an opportunity to do it. I'm all for low taxes with less spending. I'm completely against low taxes with more spending which is what we currently have

Well, you said it did in your original post
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:30:45
I don't doubt this is coming at some point in the near future. The FED is going to raise interest rates. GDP is going to slow more than expected. Rates still are not going to be that high and there is going to be pressure to get on the gas pedal. That is going to put pressure on the dollar. If you guys haven't already done so. Taking 10 or 20% of your retirement account if it's in the S&amp;P 500 and going to gold/silver is not a bad plan. Assets overall should gain if this happens but the worst part of it all is the poor are who get hurt the worst. They have no hard assets and their purchasing power is reduced
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:52:31
I would love these a lot more if the fees were more respectable. Something like coinbase maybe? Currently so many are like 10% which kills usefulness 
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:55:47
Yeah it's definitely part of the issue but it's not all of it. The Trump tariffs are affecting both companies. You also have GDP in the United States basically at a peek. It's looking to decline for at least the next couple years. From a stock perspective what catalyst is there for the price to go higher? It's not the economy. It's not a special product. I think AMD and Intel both have a good future. I would just be looking to buy the stocks on sale. If AMD gets under 10 again I'm going to pick up some.

That part has always mystified me with some of the gloom and doom gold people. I mean don't get me wrong I actually own a few ounces of gold. All it is, is a hedge against Fiat. If they start printing the shit out of the dollar and it devalues the gold goes up. I don't really make anything because it's going to take a lot more dollars to buy whatever that object is

You can easily make the argument Bitcoin is somewhat centralized since the majority of the coins are in a few hands but it's not even on the same level as Zuck bucks

I got into Bitcoin back in 2017. That makes me kind of middle-aged as bitcoiners go. It's kind of a giant emotional rollercoaster. If someone ever wants to get out you just sit back and wait for another hype cycle. One will come eventually and that's when you exit. A lot of what I have seen is just despair though. People that get in and then give up. 
The two things I think that are missing are a real use case. Like what do you do with this? Because using it for cash with taxes the way they are isn't that easy. The second is a good on ramp. I mean coinbase is kind of janky so this Fidelity development could be a big deal. If people think well I will buy a few hundred dollars of Bitcoin and they have a long-term Horizon that could really add stability to the market

If they actually did that with gold they would not need the etf. The really big Draw to an ETF is it allows every institution to trade the product. Right now it's just Fidelity since they have license and physical custody

Yep. And there is a very logical argument for it to happen. If crowd mentality begins to feel to tether is not safe. That money is going to go somewhere and it's unlikely to go to US dollars because if that was possible it already would be there. I mean who would really pick tether over a US dollar? That means the most likely stable coin is Bitcoin. The pump would indeed be legendary. I don't really want to throw out numbers as they would all be guessing but I think it would catch a lot of people off guard. A lot of these people that say they are waiting for 3000 or 4000 or whatever lower number would be staring at the screen and potentially seeing a number a bit larger than 6

just left a meeting, a ceo for one of the west coast bank chains was there. i was able to chat with him for roughly 5 minutes. quick chat about the s&amp;p 500. brought up crypto. he thinks it has a future but it's hard to say what the future will be. bitcoin may or may not be it but the advantages in blockchain over the legacy chain were apparent to him. 
most interesting part of the chat was his opinion on banking. he said it's likely had its day in the sun. smaller banks will be merged and consolidated. he expected the smaller community banks to disappear and said their growth model was facing substantial headwinds with regulation and emerging technology. he was not at all bullish about BoA, chase, citi, goldman etc

Some of these alt right sites are getting shut down because they spread hate and violence.

The question I asked about the climate change was this. Bitcoin is using less power than the current banking system. If they are claiming we are going to get two degrees off of Just Bitcoin. Well we are basically fucked anyway as a species because that's less than 1% of the power consumption. The other 99% * 2 degrees would be over 198c with that funny math.

I don't know if you have been watching the books but bids got pulled. My personal guess is they knew people would be panicking a little bit since Wall Street sold off so hard. If you pull the bids then the Panic sellers keep driving the price lower. Once that is over you turn the bids back on and purchase at lower prices. Give it a few days to see what happens but right now it's pretty constructive. We made a low that was higher than the last low and rebounded pretty well off of it. Now you just watch and wait to see if the low we made a couple hours ago holds

I would argue it's more education. In fact it's a lot more education. People can say all kinds of things. It's very easy to mislead the ignorant which is what we see happening a lot on the alt-right.
I think this is one of the main reasons that the right-wing is extremely opposed to government-funded education and especially higher education. They blow billions and billions of dollars on weapons and special interests so it's definitely not the funding it's where the funding is going and if you have an educated populace they aren't going to believe a lot of the bullshit

We have had some pretty large moves. The volume of tether just in the past month has been reduced by something like 30%. When people sell off tether batches of it go back and are redeemed for US Dollars shrinking the supply . when US Dollars come in more tether is printed. Everyone knew tether had a lot of money in the bank but people question if they have a 100% ratio in the bank. If they don't, you want to get out early. Before the money goes dry. 
There are also better options. Winkle coin has been doing really well. It does everything tether did only better. Also noteworthy there is nearly three times as much tether on the market right now as there was in December of 2017. There are a ton of people waiting on the sidelines with cash in hand.

It's hard to say. If you look at the chart on coinmarketcap it's done this once before. I kind of think that is an unlikely scenario but I won't discount it. I think it's more likely a good rumor could get crowd mentality going. Lots of people wanting to get out of tether really quickly. You know how the crypto Market thrives on rumor and speculation. I think even if tether is not a hundred percent legit there is probably a good amount of money there. If you look at the market cap of tether it's three times larger or nearly three times larger now than it was back in December. I think a lot of that $20,000 Bitcoin went into tether. If people truly get scared about it we may have the end of the bear Market by proxy. BTC would be the first stop for that money to go

they have commented on those things. They are part of the reason they have become so strict. 
I'm more curious what you guys get out of the right-wing. If you're not making over 250,000 a year why would you support it?
Like what do you personally get? Is it just that you identify with the abrasive asshole personalities? Or I mean help me out here. It's definitely not libertarian and it's definitely not the root of Bitcoin so it's not that. What's with all the conspiracy theory and alt right support in here lately. Is it racism? I've been out shopping and ask people I ran into doing right-wing demonstrations what it is they support and a couple of them have been pretty forward about that. No nggers towels or spics in our neighborhoods. I was like okay, and continued my walk. 
I can explain very clearly why I support the two main points on the left which are taxpayer-funded education and healthcare. Everyone benefits. It's not a special interest. I look at the price of college in 1980 and I look at it today and, just to make it short it's went up a lot faster than inflation or wages. Government spends billions of dollars on armaments. Corporate welfare. Other garbage I don't benefit from. At least with health care and education every citizen around has the opportunity. Seems like a better use of funds

Only turn on the phone when you need to make transactions. Without any potential for infiltration on a clean os you're pretty solid.

It probably will depend on how big of balance you keep with them. If you keep accounts around zero probably not because then you're putting the risk on to The Exchange. If you keep a few thousand dollar balance then it's more likely you're going to be able to buy small amounts and have it instantly available.

A lot of it depends on the bias of Congress. One of the best examples I can think of is when they passed the anabolic steroid Control Act. They had countless doctors testifying about keeping patients under supervision and correct dosing and how to be safe. They ignored the entire medical community and used evidence from TV shows and pop culture to say how bad it was. This of course made older men who needed testosterone for legitimate purposes felons if they tried to use it. Only recently have rules been relaxed to allow usage in such cases. The point I'm making is they ignored the people they should have been listening to and listened to the people they should not have been listening to. 
You just cross your fingers and hope they are not going to do that with dr. Doom and the intellectuals and developers will succeed

No I really don't. What shouldn't concern you is the fact you identify it being political with hate speech. There are plenty of conservative sites that argue for tax cuts for the wealthy. Anti-abortion. Reduce funding for the poor. Most of the conservative talking points like that are all over the place. They are not censored. 
What get censored are Alex Jones types. People that exist just to stir the pot and get people worked up. You know that guy who mailed off the bombs? Not only was I not surprised but I now wonder how many other people just like him or out there because some people really get indoctrinated by the right-wing propaganda. 
My opinion I have stated many times. I think people on the far-left and far-right are doing nothing but dividing the country and the people who benefit from that are the ultra-wealthy. They keep the common folks fighting amongst themselves while they pick our pockets and pass laws to benefit themselves

Google Bitcoin chart.
Now throw a dart anywhere on the board except late 2017 and in a few years you will almost certainly be able to include that.
Ever since 2009 there has been the risk of this whole project collapsing and that risk has not went away. If this was a certain investment it would not have the ability to generate returns. That element of risk and not knowing if it's going to continue is what separates people. A lot of people look at this and they see the price decline this year and they think that is going to continue forever and the whole thing is over. Many of those people have already sold. It's even more common with this new breed of Internet skeptic. Very few people have been able to hang on through the Long Haul. Bitcoin is very good at breaking almost everyone with fear panic and emotion even though like I said earlier. All you have to do is throw a dart on a chart and the price will be lower than it is today. You have around a 97% chance of that Dart hitting a lower number than where we are right now

Remember the creator of that liberty dollar back then went to prison. No one who really created bitcoin wants anyone to know it. It's quite possible  that went all of this was going down  the person in charge of those wallets  wanted to destroy them so there was no connection. There is also the possibility of it being hal and his family not knowing where all of it was or not wanting to be involved in it on that level.

If you're over 50 and especially if you have health issues Obamacare was pretty terrible . It was very much person dependent though. My premiums actually fell. I'm relatively young and fit. My mother's on the other hand. They went up. Almost doubled. a couple years ago I was in a meeting with one of the democratic campaign strategist in this state and I asked him about that. I said you guys realize this is going to likely create blowback when all of the elderly notice they have an increase in premium. The thought at the time was Obamacare was not a permanent policy. What happened is the Republicans got into Congress earlier than expected and blocked any further evolution of the bill. At least that's what I was told. Piecing it together it sounded like the plan was going to be Single Payer or some modified version of it.
I think the one you said about neither party represents me is very healthy. I would like to see more people say that. If you identify with more things on the right or left that is personal preference. I don't think politicians have the interest of the country or the average citizen in mind. You might have a handful that do. But I think a lot are of the opinion that nothing they will do will help everyone so they might as well do all they can to help themselves. You follow that thought down for a while and you start getting bills that are working against us. You start doing the math on the increase in deficit from all of these tax cuts. One of two things is going to happen. The FED is going to be forced into raising rates in order to contain inflation. Or if we let inflation run hot prices are going to rise faster than wages. In either scenario guess who benefits. Banks. Big business. S&amp;P 500 companies. In either situation guess who does not benefit. The average guy making 40 to 50 thousand a year
Ps. The most honest and libertarian Republican of the bunch is probably justin amash. I noticed you mentioned Rand Paul. He is a smaller government reduced spending Republican. You may notice his party has basically alienated him and gave him no support for office. The big Republican donors don't want anything to do with him or a smaller government even though he does represent the conservative values much better than what we currently have

Well that's just the thing with education. We are importing a lot of people from India to work in the tech industry because they have subsidized education over there. They are turning out lots of workers. People here are reluctant to spend a hundred thousand on College to make 80 to 90 thousand a year best case scenario and oftentimes less. 
The health care issue at least in this country is rooted around pharmaceutical companies. They make just an obscene profit on the drugs versus what you can buy the same drugs for in Canada or even where I think you're probably from in England. There are lobbyists that make sure things stay this way because it is profitable. A mix between private and public health care and the same thing with education would be nice to look into. It would be nice to have the debates on these things and actually make progress. In America what happens is lobbyists come in and they get laws passed in the middle of the night and then people wake up to the results.

I mean you're probably right but it's just guessing without any factual evidence. The only thing we can go by is what is reported. The only thing I have noticed is this particular exchange has more complaints than every other exchange on the planet recently

That it's unlikely, based on what we know about Satoshi, that he would have such strong political leanings One Direction. The housing crisis and banking crisis started under Clinton and grew to what it was under Bush. It's very unlikely that Satoshi would be such a hardcore party Warrior. It's more likely the real Satoshi would be against the left and the right. Not liking everything Donald Trump says like Nick does. 
I'm also not sure if you're aware but the left is not the existing establishment right now. Congress and the president are both on the right. I'm trying to point out your own biases but you keep refusing to see them on some of these issues

You're further strengthening my point. You claim science is left-leaning? You're hitting all the Talking Points the popular media outlets on the right program people with. I would be having the same argument this was reversed. If I ran into somebody who was really really on the left I would be calling them out just like I am you. I brought up parties first because Nick is a right-wing party Warrior which does not fit the mold of Satoshi. You also strike me as a right-wing party Warrior which is probably why you identify with him. That's okay. It's a free country but realize what you are
Ps. You may notice climate change was not a right-wing talking point back as early as 2005 and before. Special interest money bought various politicians because big businesses could not deal with changes to their business model that operating clean would require. You may notice even oil companies like Chevron now have Pages devoted to climate change. You might want to reconsider the position and realize you're listening to bought politicians when oil companies are even talking about the effects of all the carbon we put into the air. The right likes to use so-called alternative media channels because they know a lot of the people have a distrust of government and large corporate media Outlets so they frame them in a different way. You're being manipulated if you follow such things
I personally am not left-wing or right-wing. I think for myself and identify issues for what they are. I won't blindly support either party and I speak out against the divide both parties are trying to create in society. I am a Bitcoin maximalist because I want freedom from the oppressive rule of corporate government

This argument doesn't really have anything going for it. People say well if it cost you $5 to mine $4.20 of Bitcoin then all you have to do is wait. Well you could have also bought $5 of Bitcoin and still waited. The only difference is you would have more for your money and you don't have to buy miners

You have no idea what you're even agreeing or disagreeing about do you...
Is it nick? Is it you being a party Warrior? Or was it denying science because some YouTube video told you so? I'm not sure. Are you?

As fast as that happened. My personal guess is either a person or hedge fund that decided to go a little bit more risk off. 
A lot of people still see Bitcoin as a risk on asset
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:35:46
That's part of it, the other one is you will be able to have it in your 401k, you will be able to have it in your normal trading account and most importantly you just opened up a brokerage that has nearly 2 trillion under management . what happens if people decide they want to add 1% to their portfolio.
The volume is so thin right now it only takes a couple thousand Bitcoin to move the market
This is likely going to take time to play out but in the big picture like over the next few years this is wildly bullish

They are open to buy whatever they want. Some of the more famous are people like Mike novogratz and his fund there are plenty of smaller ones likely doing the same thing.

i think they actually need to do it. once the price runs through 10k we will see mainstreet start to wake up again. i think the average person is more likely to buy bitcoin above 10k than they are at 5-6k. the headlines have to come back. the hype has to build.

It's not necessarily just being racist. The real movement on the alt-right is dividing the country. There is this other group of people you are supposed to hate because they are doing everything that is causing all of your problems.  I read a comment a few minutes ago on another site that just made me laugh. Greenpeace exposed Monsanto setting up fake studies and fake farms for marketing. Some right-wing tribal Warrior read that and was like why is Greenpeace doing something good? I don't even know what to believe now?
The same thing is in effect with climate change and various other topics. It becomes religion. It becomes tribal Warfare. 
Meanwhile the elected officials pick our pockets while the citizens argue amongst themselves. If people actually United and got on the same page we would clean house with all of these dirty politicians and actually have a government of the people again

the truthful answer: no one knows and we have no historical backtest.
the only thing we do know is since 2009 we have had an uptrend as more and more people get involved. the risk i see is with hedge funds who may be holding a lot. if they go risk off and investors want out they may be forced into selling.
however, when things get bad,. like real bad gold and silver do well and if people see bitcoin as similar it should rally right about the time people get worried about inflation and slow growth. the US has a hot economy and a fed doing what the fed does defending the dollar and trying to keep inflating in check. when the economy slows which realistically will start by the end of this year and going into next there will be a point when people get bearish on the dollar, rate cuts will happen. gdp will be low of negative and this is when gold often takes off. hard to say exactly when this will all come to pass but late 2019-2020 is real real likely. bitcoin halving is also mid 2020. time events really line up on this
it's also the same point in the cycle bitcoin was born last time
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:34:58
Personally I wouldn't do it just yet. Over the next 12 months we are going to have better options. The big issue with gbtc is what you're buying. Currently I'm still of the opinion if you want to have a long-term position the best thing you can do is get your hands on some Bitcoin, put it in a 24 word wallet and forget you have it for a bit

If you're looking for ways to launder Drug Money this probably isn't your best option. I mean if you're trying to be Incognito your username isn't really helping your case

 I also have questioned this just like many of us have. Does the bcash idea really make sense? From a very basic perspective it definitely does but it's not a long-term solution. You can't infinitely scale on chain. To make a long story short even some of the brightest Minds like Andreas Antonopoulos in 2015 were talking about increasing the block size before congestion happened. A year or two later he flat-out admitted he changed his mind and gave very good reasoning why
It definitely takes a lot more research and understanding to wrap your head around why the small-block sidechain argument makes more sense than just increasing the block size.

@_date: 2019-08-13 20:36:34
Because most people who try trading get emotionally involved and lose more money than if they would have just camped
It's all perspective because $10 a Bitcoin a few years ago would be a substantial sum of money today. Pick your dollar amounts of Bitcoin and the trend is very likely to continue. Why is that? You have a fixed Supply and growing interest
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:35:32
I had the exact same thought when I first got into Bitcoin. Then I remembered what using the internet and a computer was like in the 80s. I mean just starting a game on an early commodore required actually typing run commands and directly pointing at the file location. Now all someone has to do is click a button. The old bulletin boards on the Internet were just huge listings of text. You had to manually sort through them to find what you wanted. Also note there was one hell of a lot of criminal activity in the early days on the bulletin boards. Something Bitcoin gets a bad rap for right now. I see a lot of similarities between the two

Absolutely.. I was just talking to a friend of mine about this earlier. When we were trading 14,000 not long ago the amount of Bitcoin for sale was extremely small. It would have taken very little to run the order books. Bring the price down and you get the gamblers to capitulate. Frees up more coins to accumulate. It's the perfect time to do it because the news is broadcasting fear all day long when it comes to traditional markets and people are thinking the economy might slow.
It's a great time to scare people. I think I have a reasonably good idea how the next few months are going to play out. We are going to finish the Panic phase and then have another fast rise before the halving. There will be another Market Peak somewhere at or above 20k in the dec to mar neighborhood in anticipation of the halving. News will be extremely positive and there will be a lot of hype which will mark another short-term top

The lowest cost way to do this is to just open your coinbase account and then go to coinbase Pro. Sell your crypto there and directly transfer it to your bank account. All said and done you'll pay less than $0.25 in fees for that amount

You have to realize that some people are just pessimistic about everything. Some of those people still on bitcoin and still invest they just literally have to have a hateful mentality it's like how they are wired. Other people may have been burned or bought the top or who knows what but it's a cesspool just like the Donald or other such subs where people are rewarded for being as negative or hateful or pessimistic as possible always looking for something to blame

That's what the religious community says. The truth is we don't know because Bitcoin has never really traded and existed in a global recession. It was born from one.
A lot of the hedge fund Community still sees bitcoin as a risk  asset

Do you live in a case Shiller 20 City? Wages are considerably higher. There are few vacant homes on the west or east coast. The Midwest might be a different situation but no one wants to be there. The culture is in a word fucked
The trend of home prices is higher and it's going to continue being so with the low rates world governments are pushing. 
The devaluation is going to be the Fiat. You just hope that way just keep Pace with what's really going on with it. So far that hasn't been the case for the poor class. College costs and housing costs since the year 2000 up almost 3x. On the higher end of the spectrum wages are doing pretty good but on the lower end of the spectrum a job that paid $10 an hour back then pays maybe 18 now. Not a good thing

You misread that. What they were talking about with the yield curve is often a precursor to a recession. It doesn't mean we are in one now and even if we are no one will know it for at least a few months when the data comes out. 
What's really going on is Traders are positioning and pushing on the FED for a 50 point cut in September. Trump is also part of the manipulation as all of the tariffs add to slowing on the economy . kind of like his foot is on the brake pedal. If we get some fed cuts and Trump starts to take his foot off the brake the economy will re-accelerate and recession could potentially be averted.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:17:59

It remains to be seen if that argument is going to work. Maybe. But this is the first time Bitcoin has been in a real crisis and a lot of the hedge fund Community still sees it as a risk asset. A lot of us might want to look at it like gold but it's not trading that way right now
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:31:50
The thing about that is you're not likely to understand it until you've been around Bitcoin at least a few months sometimes a few years. 
In my opinion one of the best places to start is by listening to Andreas Antonopoulos. Also reading a lot of the old posts on bitcoin talk
Currently we are in the disbelief phase of what I think is a bull market so a lot of this particular subreddit is filled with conspiracy alt right posters. They think the government is crashing and Bitcoin is going to rule Supreme. I'm not agreeing or disagreeing I just know the psychology of the market cycle and when these guys show up. It's a good hint at what point we are in. When this sub gets very optimistic and what I would consider  more normal and you start seeing a lot of college-educated people having very intellectual discussions and things get really peaceful. You might want to look at selling a little
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:11:26
Well it depends on if you see it like gold or not because we know what's coming if we do get in a recession and that's a lot of easy money and stimulus. There's a really good chance gold and silver are going higher and ideally Bitcoin plays along. Quite simply weaker Fiat stronger hard money
There are two theories on my mind with what's going on. One of them is hedge funds are lightning up to maintain margin. Some of those places have some serious long Leverage and everything is trading on Cross margin
The second theory is the scammers and the 200,000 Bitcoin. If those guys are starting to panic and see prices going down they could be capitulating and dumping. There's a thread on here about what they have and what's going on
The last one is just purely technical. We have not tested the 21-week EMA since this began. During the 2015 to 2017 bull market that happened a few times
I guess that's actually three theories but I never said that I could count very well

@_date: 2019-10-16 22:06:41
Well that's exactly what's going on but the poor do this to themselves just like they did with housing in 2009.
What really matters historically is accumulating assets. I don't care what crisis you talk about. If you own shares of a good company. If you own land. If you own gold. That's wealth but poor people always think it's the dollar. They are terrified of losing a dollar and the fear of loss greatly overwhelms any potential feeling of gain. The part I find the most ironic is the dollar, and I'm talking about the US dollar which for Fiat is the best one has lost over 95% of its purchasing power and that has greatly accelerated since 1971 when we totally came off the gold standard.
An ounce of gold is still an ounce of gold and one Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin but the masses look at both of these completely different depending on how you value them in paper money. Again the irony is a hundred years ago it only took 20 paper dollars to buy an ounce of gold. Now it takes 1500. Just a few years ago it only took a couple hundred dollars to buy a Bitcoin. Now it takes 8 thousand. People say oh my gosh that has went up so much. No no no not at all. It hasn't went up at all. The dollar has just lost power against it requiring more of them to buy one
That 2% inflation they say on TV as a myth and you can figure it out for yourself looking at actual prices. Has the price of college went up 2% a year oh gosh no it's much more. Has the price of gold went up 2% a year? Oh no it's much more. Same with property. Now we have had advances in productivity which help but hard assets versus the dollar have greatly been outpacing them for decades

Yeah I'm totally with you on all that. The thing this time is we have a lot of hedge funds playing around in Bitcoin . well they have always been around truthfully I suppose.

It's a multi-year journey that will only make sense to you if you keep studying.
Andreas Antonopoulos is a great source. You definitely want to read the Bitcoin standard. Subscribe to Anthony pompliano's podcasts.
In short you have a finite object that has proven itself for 10 years. It keeps increasing in value. Fiat currencies keep decreasing in value. The best one of all is the US dollar and it has lost over 95% of its value. An ounce of gold is still an ounce of gold but in 1920 an ounce of gold only cost twenty paper dollars. Today it is 1500. Gold did not go up. If you look at the price of a horse or other assets that were for sale at the time they are roughly the same price today when priced in gold. What happened is the dollar went down that's why it takes so much more of them to buy the gold.

You would be better off keeping gold under your mattress historically. I mean look at the value of cash. In 1910 it only took 20 paper dollars to buy an ounce of gold today it takes 1500 and if you look at all of the debt created gold is drastically underpriced. Paper Fiat evaporates. Gold is basically first generation Bitcoin

The extreme disparity between haves and have nots. I mean 85% of btc with wallets north of 10.. it's already a cornered market.

Start with baby steps. If your business is anything like mine even if you accept Bitcoin you're not going to get a lot of payments with it. Use a good low-fee segwit wallet and don't overthink it. If you start getting more than one payment a week and it becomes constant then you can look into improving where possible.
Step one is actually getting people to spend it because right now it's been months since I have taken a Bitcoin payment. No one wants to sell / spend it

Is it safe? When I look at the broad spectrum of ways to buy Bitcoin yeah it's actually pretty safe. Are you actually buying Bitcoin? Not really you're buying a derivative. You can't take possession of the keys or actually physically hold it. 
I'm going to give you a really legitimate explanation on this. Robinhood claims they hold the Bitcoin and you're buying part of that. At least that's the way it's been printed now if you buy a gold share like iau it's also the same thing. For example let's say we buy a hundred million dollars of iau shares in one month. Now I'm not 100% sure about the settlement. But I think it's monthly worst-case its quarterly. The bank has to go buy physical gold bars to cover all those shares within a time period. Robinhood claims they are doing exactly this with Bitcoin and maybe they are. For example if someone buys a bunch of Bitcoin and more people buy a bunch at the end of the month or whenever they do it they are going to buy physical Bitcoin. The same is true with selling. 
Is it actually owning Bitcoin? No it isnt but I wouldn't call it a dangerous way to speculate. Robinhood is a solid company. Compared to all the countless scams out there at least you know you are dealing with a reputable company

Prices being pushed around on leveraged exchanges. There are a lot of gamblers in the space that have wild emotional swings. There isn't really any serious news that moves Bitcoin even though some of the sides try and say there is. I have however noticed when they want to manipulate price down you will see a string of negative videos and comments and press releases. The flip side happens when they want to push it up. During that 6-month rally we had this year there were all kinds of positive articles published and some of them were downright fabricated. 
There's really nothing to understand in short-term price movements. Big picture the halving is going to take place in may and that's going to be similar to 63 million dollars of coins generated removed from the market every week. Remember miners are creating new Bitcoin and a lot of times selling them on the market daily. For the price just to stay even there has to be a good deal of buying

It just started this year when the price began to accelerate again. Everyone was actually really cool through 2018 and the bear market. Most of the talking was about development and people just made jokes about the price. The Euphoria of 2017 was gone
It's like all of that now doesn't exist and we have this new batch of really hostile people who may have just found bitcoin and have the know-it-all mentality.
Personally I can't wait for them to sell and find something else to do so we can move into another Euphoria period Where everybody is really cool again

Recession upcoming? What makes you think there's going to be a recession? The media has been calling for one every year since roughly 2012. Europe definitely could have a recession but America?, I wouldn't bet on it. If there is one it's going to be mild because they are going to inflate the shit out of assets before they let prices fall
Bitcoin on the other hand? Well it definitely wouldn't be that hard to run the price up. You got a lot of tether money on the sidelines that thought they were going to get in on the next Bull Run. People lever trade up. As we go higher and higher large Pockets start building a short position and then short futures. Borrow a lot of Bitcoin and just pop it down on the market. At this point it becomes like Dominos you just keep triggering stop losses over and over and over the lower we go. Eventually that's going to exhaust itself. Unless we have a recovery come on soon there is a real possibility that this isn't like one of the temporary Corrections in 2016 and 2017 and we are going to go into a consolidation for some time

It's funny. We all have these psychological swings during price movements. 
Some people think if it goes down a certain amount more I'm selling. I was thinking if some of these lower targets get hit I need to make sure I have cash on the side to buy more

Been going on for years. Where is the catalyst? Why now? Why not last year or the year before?
Currently there has been a lot of retail outflow from stock accounts. The media reinforces the pessimism. Meanwhile the government is going to inflate this. What do you think happens to the markets when those people get back in? We have basically had a two-year consolidation on the S&amp;P 500 and some of the sectors have already completed a bear Market. I mean look at FedEx? Does it go lower? Maybe I mean it is in a downtrend but it's also at that position you need to be looking for a bottom. That's a 50% haircut on a global leader. Currently the signs have the slowdown continuing into next year and then re accelerating by mid-year and into year end. Most people are completely on the wrong side of this expecting some kind of collapse. The stage is not set for that just yet. I think what's getting a lot of people is honestly just human nature. People think in patterns. They say it's been 10 years that's the longest expansion in history. Like somehow there's going to be an expiration date because of that. Because it happened in the past they expect it in the future. This type of thinking gets people in trouble trying to look for a pattern when one doesn't exist
The hard market to figure is gold. Lot of people have went this direction. Commercial shorts are very high. Will people start selling their gold to go back into stocks next year? That's a really good question I don't even have a guess on. I think a lot will depend on frame of mind

It is how trust works. It's why gold is still what it is. I don't give a fuck about the technology. I'm sure as years go by there will be better and better technology and absolutely none of it will be Bitcoin just like nothing else is gold.

Do you have any idea how good the fake media in crypto actually is? I've seen completely fabricated journalism that goes so deep as to actually faking the research material they put into the article. I mean they fake legitimate-looking documents and use them in the article. You know how I know this is true because I looked into crypto kicks. Remember like a year ago when Nike was supposedly messing around with that. It's all a sham. None of it was actually true.

If you did the opposite of what Tom Lee said you would be broke because he was rooting for Bitcoin to go higher all year and it went from what around 4,000 at the beginning of January to a peak of 14,000. Your account would be smoked if you shorted that
On the equities side he is of the opinion that prices will go higher at least in the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Part of it is there is nowhere else to go and the other part of it is World governments are going to print like there is no tomorrow to support markets and keep unemployment low. They literally can't afford a 2009 situation and will go out of their way to make sure we don't get one
The other thing you have to keep in mind with someone who has a macro mind is he's looking at markets in terms of years not days and weeks which is what the average Gambler does. He gets things wrong just like the rest of us in the short-term but big picture I completely agree with him. Bitcoin is going higher and equities are going higher. I have no idea what's going to happen this year or maybe even next. I'm looking at least three to five years out
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:29:05

I think over time they will be spread out more. You have to think this out. 90% of people plus are not earlier adopter mentality. They do what they are told and they do what they have been conditioned to do. A lot of people are very traditional and just repeat the same process they have been taught. That's where the institutions come in. When you have your advisor at Fidelity talking about Bitcoin and you see it in smart Money Magazine. And then it starts getting more spread out but the institutions aren't going to start writing articles like that until they have quite a lot of this stuff to sell to people.
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:22:11
Of course, but trying to predict when is a good way to go broke if you're thinking of shorting it. I mean the media has been negative about this for years and even pointing out some pretty good things. Market grinds higher. Debt fueled growth. You may notice in December of 2018 is the only time we had real selling. That's when the Fed was tightening rates and people were genuinely worried about a credit crunch. There is a lot of Leverage out there. As long as rates stay low the musical keeps playing

To be honest with you if you don't use a hardware wallet, which I definitely don't recommend I mean they cost like $50. However if for some crazy reason you just won't buy one I would probably be more inclined to trust my Bitcoin split between a couple of trusted exchanges like coinbase, binance and  Kraken. You can have 2fa on each one and if I think about the past few years on how people lose money it's usually some hacked up web wallet, spyware. Visiting crypto phishing sites etc
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:30:39
Actually man. That's a pretty good point. 
The thing is, like let's say you're a drug dealer or you run illegal arms or something where you have a lot of cash and you don't want people to know who you are. I mean I'm guessing that's the reason you would want to avoid kyc. I mean dude start buying stuff off Craigslist to hustle. Hit up the gold shops and buy a bunch of gold coins. Turn those around, trade them for things. Barter. I mean there are plenty of ways to hide money.
But you make a really good point. People that want to get Bitcoin and not have anyone find out who they are. if the goal is Bitcoin. I would probably look to buy some miners with that cash I mean they are usually for sale on Craigslist in every city. Then you set up the miners, start mining and you have clean Bitcoin and no one knows where it came from.
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:09:42
Don't worry, I'm sure the Panic selling gamblers will be around shortly. 
In all truthfulness this is a little bit weird though because we went up at an extremely fast pace and are selling off just as hard. Like seriously why the fuck did you buy Bitcoin if you're just going to turn around and sell it the first time it begins to move down on you. Even more insane is how many people bought above the current price we are at right now. All of those dumb motherfuckers are selling at a loss because they have smaller balls than my girlfriend. That's right my girlfriend wait a minute what am I saying, scratch that...

I think that's the magic. So many people are so bearish right now. People are convinced there is going to be this Global recession. 
The thing is, we're in the slow down right now. Markets should accelerate into the second half of next year.
I have heard about every bearish argument there is and in the short term Which is less than 5 years none of them have any Merit. They are simply going to inflate this mess and you can see it if you look at the positioning of large accounts. Home builders? Huge rally. Why is that? Interest rates are going down and staying that way. Reit shares same story. Realty plus a yield in an environment where treasuries or other world bonds are going to be 2% or less
There is just an assload of money on the sidelines that will flow back into the markets once the news narrative changes. 
People may say but the S&amp;P 500 didn't have a 50% correction. That's the Brilliance of it. The average person expects patterns to keep repeating. There was no huge sell-off this time simply a two-year consolidation. There is no place for that money to go but you can find sectors within the market that had their bear Market. You look at Exxon or FedEx shares lately? They are trading like we are at the bottom of a bear Market
You guys expecting some giant crash are going to be on the wrong side of this
On the Bitcoin front you are drastically reducing the Supply right at the time Fiat is going to be under inflationary pressure. I mean it seems like a pretty damn good bet to me? I think this is the period To accumulate if you missed last December. I don't have any idea what the lowest number we are going to hit this year is but I can look to the Future and if it plays out like what I just said it's going to be great for Bitcoin. You're going to have ample Capital flow and people looking to get out of their native currencies because of the u.s. dollar is under pressure you can only imagine how bad Fiat of some of these other countries is going to go

I have wondered about this one for awhile. Say you get together a Syndicate of people. Borrow a shitload of Bitcoin and dump it on the exchanges after you have a massive short position in futures. You just know every little Gambler that watches YouTube videos is going to capitulate when that price goes down. They are going to freak the fuck out when it breaks their favorite moving average and they are going to dump. The smart money at that point can ride the wave down that they started covering into all of their dumping. The same smart money could then buy a huge position at a much lower price since crypto YouTube is going to be freaked out thinking it's a bear market. Once the smart money has this big position they can paint the charts and make everything look pretty on the technicals then selling the same Bitcoin back to these people at a much higher price

If you're in the United States or Western Europe you're going to have a really hard time living like that.
However it's not impossible. It's not a subject I really know that much about but there are people who live just on bitcoin. Andreas Antonopoulos is one of them. Maybe look into studying with that guy has done and how he operates. 
With most of the known ways to buy Bitcoin with cash you leave yourself a little bit vulnerable. Ideally you would find a guy who is reasonably honest you could meet in person and just hand him the money point your phones at each other and pick up some.

The first wave of cryptoassets,
1 of which Bitcoin is the best known, have so far failed to provide 
a reliable and attractive means of payment or store of value. They have suffered from highly volatile 
prices, limits to scalability, complicated user interfaces and issues in governance and regulation, among 
other challenges. Thus, cryptoassets have served more as a highly speculative asset class for certain 
investors and those engaged in illicit activities rather than as a means to make payments.
If this is the worst they can come up with, well, draw your own conclusions

It's a little different in here because a lot of us like to fuck around with different wallets and understanding how the protocol works and geeking out.

I don't see any sign of a recession. Not in the near future. I think the media is doing a good job of scaring the shit out of people but we had a catalyst in 2001 and we had a catalyst in 2008. Currently there isn't one but there is a real real big growing problem that is multiple years out. The Euro might not exist in 10 years. The United States debt to GDP is approaching 120% and in roughly seven years it will be there. We haven't had a president that has reduced debt to GDP since Bill Clinton and none of the candidates on the horizon appear to be low debt candidates. I think that's where the big problem is. When this comes it's really hard to say what's going to happen but hard assets are where I would want to be. People are going to get laid off and the price of everything is stupid hard to predict because if we have a currency meltdown everything like hard assets is going to go up but you're going to have fewer people buying which pulls prices down so I really don't know how that's going to go. I mean maybe The Wealthy buy things? Who knows but the Euro crisis and United States debt to GDP somewhere around 2025 to 2027 is a major problem. That could create a very nasty recession and lead to a restructuring of global debt and Global Currency. They used to call this a debt Jubilee where a lot of debt was forgiven but you know if they do this the hard assets are going to be where you want to have your money parked. I think seeing gold at $10,000 an ounce or higher is extremely realistic before I die. Even looking at Japan. 100 years ago one yen was 1 oz of silver. Today 10,000 yen is about $90 or roughly 5 oz of silver. That's like a prism to the Future for the rest of the world. They are going to inflate currency until they can't
@_date: 2019-10-18 05:12:20
Maybe, maybe not. Let's just review a few things. When we were trading at 3100 everyone was convinced we were going to 2000 or lower. On the way up people were calling tops starting about five thousand and one hundred percent convinced 6800 would be a rejection
So the media and the masses have been wrong for pretty much 12 months straight at every venture. What makes you think they are going to be right this time?
@_date: 2019-10-07 08:58:33
It's an important lesson on why being a bear can be a great way to lose money. The central banks can keep inflating assets longer than most people think is even possible. 
I mean I'm very aware that when you look at the price of Fiat, tons of them have already failed globally. The best one is the US dollar and it is down versus gold something like 99% in less than a hundred years and really the mass loss of purchasing power began in 1971 when the dollar was taken off the gold standard completely. Humans have a fucking terrible history of any money that is not finite. Greed always takes over and the end result is always the same. This time however it may take decades for things to really unwind. If we do have trouble soon and by soon I mean within the next 10 years it's very likely to start within Europe.

Bitcoin is definitely not the one true Hedge and if you program your mind to believe that you kind of lose track of what we're actually doing with it

Pretty chill. Occasionally I get worked up pissed off and talk shit to people if things get a little too crazy
Big picture large wallets are still accumulating and small wallets are still selling. Buy large I mean greater than 10 and by small I mean less than 1
There's been a bit of a shift at least in the United States when it comes to mentality and it isn't just with Bitcoin. The media is really pushing this recession narrative and I don't think they are going to stop until we see S&amp;P 500 break to new all-time highs and go into an uptrend. With all these rate cuts that we have been pushing into the system the acceleration should start sometime next year. Markets may move before that. It's really hard to say. There is a rather extreme level of pessimism and that translates to money on the sidelines in regards to both equities and Bitcoin.

Just was looking at wallet statistics on btc.com. 85% of the bitcoin is in wallets with more than 10btc.

I mean there is structural risk since we have been closing under the 21 week...however. that china ponzi dump messed up the charts overwhelming buy demand. Selling right before a halving historically has not been a wise long term choice

Now? What now? What in the future even. What I've watched for the better part of two years besides the Chinese Ponzi pump is people sell every single rally we get. That psychology does not say I want to accumulate and I want to use
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:37:49
I really don't like all this anti gold stuff some people are spreading because another way to say that is if you would have kept the $100 bill it would take you four more of its friends to buy the same amount of gold. Gold isn't designed as a get-rich-quick product it's designed to hedge against devaluation of Fiat
@_date: 2019-10-06 07:29:27
You can take any hard asset and look at the value vs Fiat  the one I have shown many of my friends and family which seems to turn on the light bulb is this
I have a $20 gold double eagle coin sitting here. In 1910 it was worth $20. It's an ounce of gold . today it's worth 1500
If you buy a property in 1910 for maybe $1,000 I'm pretty sure we can all agree that would be worth six figures right now
If you have a $1 bill from 1910. It might be worth ten bucks as a collectible if it's in good condition
That's Fiat in a nutshell and the u.s. dollar is the best of breed when it comes to Fiat. Most of the others are far worse

I think from a long-term holding perspective it's one of the best metrics we can look at. The masses that look at YouTube videos pretty much use moving averages and technical analysis for everything which is why I don't think it's quite as reliable as a lot of people do. What truly matters is who's buying and who's selling. 
Those who are accumulating have been really careful not to spike the price and not do anything crazy they are just buying what people want to sell. I mean if nothing else changes, if we are stable right now what's going to happen when the supply is cut in half?

Honestly the big picture thought I have on the bearish side is why the hell was there so much unloading at such a low price? There is that new lawsuit that is heading for tether. I mean it's pretty big. The amount of money that has been sold is not small and the gains have really been nothing to write home about. Didn't even get a simple 10x
The other issue is the buying support people aren't snapping up the bargains. It's just kind of hanging out there. We also just put in a greater decline than any point after the low was in back in 2015. that's if it stops here. 
There are some stupid people who are all freaked out thinking there is a recession coming and the first thing they do is sell all their good assets and go to cash. If this makes you want to punch a baby that just means you understand monetary policy and assets are what you want to own and cash is what you don't want to own. First thing the world banks are going to do is go to 0% interest rates or below and start QE again. Then all those assets you just sold shoot up like a rocket because your cash is just worth that much less
So that's my rant maybe this Hong Kong thing is part of it. Maybe the tether thing which is kind of hard to even say since that's been an ongoing fud Point since I began in Bitcoin in 2017. 
There's a lot of people out there that just really don't believe in Bitcoin though. Because anyone that did. They sure as hell wouldn't be selling at these low prices
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:41:24
Pretty much. There is already a lot of smart money getting into investment properties. I mean Home Building stocks are doing amazing right now. That tells me that they are looking for you old and they don't expect the unemployment rate to go up for us to have a recession anytime soon. If we did have a recession rates would go lower and lower so that also would make property look like a great idea. 
I just think the conventional wisdom about getting out of equities isn't going to apply this time at least not in the next couple years. People are looking for yield and this is the first time in my lifetime you have the S&amp;P 500 with a better yield than the treasuries. There is simply no great place to park money right now. That's yet another reason I don't think equities are going to sell off at least not in the United States. There is simply nowhere else to go. 
Maybe a sliver of that money Finds Its way into Bitcoin over the next few years as the infrastructure develops. If it does buying a couple at 8,000 is going to be one of the best financial news short of buying their first home a person can make
@_date: 2019-10-07 06:54:07
You honestly better hope they aren't because all they have to do is set up a massive short position and borrow all the Bitcoin they can find to do it. 99% of these fools are going to panic sell then they can buy up all of the supply at a low price and do whatever the hell they want with it
I mean I believe in Bitcoin but I absolutely fucking hate the majority of people that are in crypto. It's a bunch of gamblers and scammers. If I had my way we would have a website where you can tip some bits and have someone beat a scammer with a baseball bat every time you tipped. Now that would be a legitimate use for Bitcoin

There was no real clear topping process to make a call on. The scenario that is playing out also was not the most probable. It is what it is and the only play now is take advantage of accumulating more at lower prices
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:36:36
Before you guys freaked out that's a near-term price. That's where they see it going in the near-term. Not next year and probably not even by the end of the year. If any of you guys trade equities you know how this game works. If something is in a bullish Trend it gets upgraded. When it gets close to that price it gets upgraded again with a higher price Target and so on and so forth

That's definitely the conversation of the day. I think it's pretty easy to play on people's fears because Bitcoin has never actually traded in a recession. The thing I'm looking at is there is going to be so much easy Fiat floating around this time it's really unlikely you're going to have assets collapse. It seems more likely they are going to inflate. 
There is so much psychology at work in Bitcoin. At 14000 no one wanted to sell. I mean the order books were really thin. Price rolls down. People panic out. Have emotional reactions. They sell and they feel better. Weeks later the price rises. At first they think it is a suckers rally. They still feel pretty good that they sold everything. Then the price keeps Rising and eventually they can't help themselves so they buy their same Bitcoin back at a higher price. Unfortunately a lot of people keep doing this over and over

There there are a ton of people who just don't get it. Like if you lay it out and explain to them, hey if we all just got one Bitcoin and camped on it. The price would stabilize. It would definitely drift up. People would see it as a growing asset class and feel confident with it. You know all that shit would be really good for adoption but you know what happens. The gamblers and the fucking low lowlifes Panic sell every goddamn time. Between them and the scammers it sometimes it amazes me we are as far along as we are
I mean you just know what happened this time. A whole bunch of people probably bought in somewhere over 9,000 probably over 10 actually. They felt good for about a week. Thought they were going to get rich. Price drops down to about eight and they decide it's a good idea to sell. Before long they are going to exhaust themselves and watch the price fly higher right in their face going past the point they bought in. Then they are going to stare at their account and look at the lost they took only to know that it would be a gain if they had just grew a pair of balls
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:31:58
Yeah that's a pretty solid argument actually man. I have had similar thoughts. 
There are just some major obstacles like the tax structure in the United States. I mean maybe that comes later and adoption starts in the east. I kind of hate to say it but at least when there was Silk Road there was a true use case. 
The current use case, I mean legitimately, is speculative asset and one that's really difficult to fundamentally value. You either believe it's worth way more than it currently is or you believe it's worth almost nothing. 
Maybe at all just needs more time
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:39:49
Psychologically in the short-term there isn't one. You have a heard chasing. In the long-term there is a big one. Gold is the longest chain of money the world has ever seen. It will likely always have value. Some may say it's a relic but it has outlasted every government that has ever existed. In a word what it has is Trust. If I give someone an ounce of gold unless they are completely retarded they know for a fact for the rest of their life that ounce of gold will have value. Bitcoin has more or less done the same thing in the cryptocurrency world. It has technical benefits over gold but again what really matters is Trust. Bitcoin is the longest chain. Bitcoin is the oldest crypto. Bitcoin is the most trusted crypto. You could take any other coin out of the cryptocurrency world and nothing would happen. If you remove Bitcoin everything falls. 
Another angle to look at with gold is it has value because people believe it does. The bullshit arguments about it being useful in industry and all of that. Well let me just say if we valued Things based on how useful they were oil would cost a hell of a lot more than it does. Bitcoin really isn't much different because when you get down to it Litecoin more or less does the same thing. It can be developed the same way but it's only worth a fraction of what Bitcoin is. Why is that? All of the reasons I just went over
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:17:30

@_date: 2019-10-11 06:52:20
That is exactly what's needed. I totally get your analogy and I have had the same thoughts. If you want to get the smart people involved there needs to be some kind of use case. The thing that just irritates me to no end is how incredibly stupid the gamblers are. I mean if Bitcoin developed stability at a given price that by itself would attract so many more investors. These crazy pumps and dumps aren't doing it any favors.

Yeah I mean you're definitely not wrong saying that. It has been a great performing asset and stock to flow probably does carry weight. 
I mean if I was looking at this from a world domination perspective. We know the majority of coins are concentrated. You get some of these Wall Street funds to buy those coins up. They build the devices to get retail involved. They bring the price up and then stabilize it and then they slowly sell into the new market. If everyone wants to make money that seems like a pretty likely scenario

That's really the magic question. Probably a whole lot of Chaos in the short-term when that kicks off. In the long-term what you want to do is make sure you have gold and land. It will also be the first real test for Bitcoin. How does it perform in a real crisis.
If the Euro goes into a period of hyperinflation. The people who have the mortgages today are going to have a great wealth transfer. They will owe a couple hundred thousand Euro on a property suddenly worth a couple million. That's if they continue with the euro. If they collapse it and invent something else. Who knows how they are going to do that but it always comes down to the same thing and that is hard assets. People want shares of the good companies. They want the gold they want the silver and they want the land. 
Paper money backed by nothing. The sad irony is that's how the poor judge the value of everything and it's probably the worst metric a person can use in that type of situation

Great job on the writing ! One argument I would make is with real estate and really most hard assets. They aren't in a bubble. What's used to buy them has simply lost purchasing power along with the increased liquidity and low rates increasing your pool of buyers. People buy payments not price. This has simply led to generations of debt. 60s were probably the last decade the average person could buy a house in cash. 90s the last decade you bought college in cash. In fact earnings reports like the latest from Briggs and Stratton point to college and mortgage debt as a headwind to sales of their small engines and tractors. In short people have less disposable income when they are married to debt. Neg rates will only increase this as the base price will go even higher and loans longer

I'm not sure if there's just a lot of you foreigners commenting on stuff but that's not the way it works in America. In goddamn hamburger America there are no fees for doing that with coinbase because you can do a direct bank transfer. Banks however don't do free wire transfers. That's the only way we can fund Kraken since they won't get off their fucking ass and setup a competitive service with coinbase no matter how many of us  bitch at them about it. 
With coinbase if I want to transfer $50 into coinbase Pro it doesn't cost me a cent. It's just like sending money to any other brokerage, Fidelity, TD, etc.
The day Kraken actually gets it figured out and starts doing this is the day their liquidity goes up a lot and coinbase panics

Trust. In a word it's trust. Bitcoin has an established history. Bitcoin has the most hash power. Bitcoin is the longest chain. 
A lot of the smaller altcoins or just cash grabs by the inventors. Even the better altcoins like Litecoin only play along with Bitcoin meaning they do well when Bitcoin goes well. They get development when Bitcoin gets development

Probably, but it's hard to say. If you read a lot of the earlier threads absolutely no one got 2013 or 2017 right the year before. At least no thread or comment that I can find and believe me I've looked. There is a trend that each parabolic run and bull market moves a smaller percentage than the last. 200 to 20k last Cycle would be roughly a 300k btc this time. The peak is likely to be under that number but above 20k. Where in there it lands depends on a lot of factors and you have to watch how they play out in real time.

Well, just looking at the posts there are a lot of you guys on here. 
The thing is, many of us have been in this for years. 
Statistically the best thing you can do with Bitcoin is just buy it which oddly enough is the same thing you do with gold. If you need a little cash at some point in life wait for a run up and sell what you need but for the most part just camp on this stuff and learn as you go. This is a multi-year journey not multi-day

I think it's more like you guys are just taking it that way. Regardless you have to pay the $20 and sometimes it's 30 depending on the bank. If he went back and edited the post and put in parentheses Bank fee would that make you feel better ? you still have to pay it it still matters
Anyway quit being a bitch with passive aggressive comments. If you want to help the situation out you should petition Kraken like I fucking have to make things easier first smaller transactions. If they hear from enough people that we want Bank transfers for free and a competitive model with coinbase maybe we'll get one

I'm not joining anything. And you can have your downvote back you little bitch. Have to smack the button rather than argue like a man
What I have found in this space is there are a small group of people who have like this religious dedication and a whole bunch of people who just want to short it to zero.
It's been 2 years now and this whole myth of people coming around and wanting to get into Bitcoin is just bullshit. It's nothing but gamblers and scammers
For two years now what happens every time we get any kind of increase in price is people pile on and short it and sell it. In fact that the only increase we got this year was from that Chinese Ponzi. Now that that thing has collapsed the selling gets going again. 
I think the bottom line is we are all just too late. Should have gotten in before 2017. End of story
I've been taking Bitcoin payments at my company for 2 years  do you know how many I have received? zero.
Even the chart right now. Guess what's going on they are selling the hell out of the exact technical level that should be support if this was going to continue moving higher. People don't fucking want it or they wouldn't be dumping it like there is no tomorrow. It's not trading even remotely constructive its trading like people who want to get the hell out
How about how many people I see posting in here on a daily basis that I remember from 2017? Single-digit percentage best case scenario.

So let me guess this is going to create another rabid pump with all the gamblers throwing their money at the screen. Then if this doesn't come to pass they are going to dump everything because that's just what they do

Eventually, all of the scammers have done a pretty good job of giving Bitcoin in a bad rap and if they haven't the altcoin fake projects definitely have
I have talked to quite a few people about Bitcoin and all of them are like I don't really understand why that would be valuable which of course does require a background in economics and understanding what's going on with Fiat. You pretty much eliminate a huge part of the population there. I think what's really going to do it is when you get places like fidelity writing up a one-page what is bitcoin thing for all of their clients and having easy access to invest

Youre 100% right about others looking to buy the dip. Question is just where will they mount a defense. If i was short i would have the position on a short leash as we are closing in on a 50% decline. Last cycle 40% was it...crazy part this time is the run and the dump happened for no real reason at all. Blew up like mad then the panic sellers came 
Thing i go back to is if they really were trying to collapse this. Why build so much infrastructure ? Then coinbase raising fees? They did this last time about 2 weeks before we broke out over 4200
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:53:10
 Thank you,
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:22:46
I think we've already passed that point. Or we certainly will soon. If you look at all of the big volume nodes a lot of the trading was happening around 6 to $7,000. Once we get past the next resistance at 11.7 there's very little volume that actually traded hands. Psychologically a lot of the people who got in trouble probably sold the Lows and the remaining few that sold it break even have already left. 
I mean if you look at a lot of the major exchanges there's just not that much Bitcoin for sale. On the somewhat scary side if we don't have some type of Correction before 20,000 the market is really setting up to scare the shit out of people when we get there because it will be a very obvious place to shake people out and retrace to the 21w. Sma. I think a lot of the people who built up a good amount really aren't concerned with selling until we are over 50,000 and quite a few over 100,000. If that doesn't happen they wait and more Supply gets pulled off the market

Yeah you're absolutely right and it mystifies me to this day how few people put any effort into learning about this. I mean a lot of people just do whatever it is the person at Fidelity tells them to. I think it's going to be one of those situations where the institutions buy up most of the supply. Drastically raise the price and then sell it back to all of the people once they create a narrative that the average person can grasp. If they control most of the supply it also makes it much easier to reduce this volatility which also drives off adoption
@_date: 2019-10-25 08:31:10
I think you underestimate what a cornered Market can do. I mean it's basically impossible to predict what number Bitcoin is going to arrive at in the next 5 to 10 years but the majority of the supply is in strong hands and that keeps growing. On top of it mining rewards keep shrinking. 
This giant dump we had and actually the pump along with it had a huge part to do with plus token and all that Ponzi money. Some of the guys that have done chainalysis have thrown around figures like 1 to 200000 Bitcoin. Like 100,000 have been sold and there may be more. If just a hundred thousand coins can move the price this much there really aren't that many Trading
Price Discovery is found on much smaller numbers of coins trading and that number is only going to shrink in the future. The market cap might get to a rather silly number but the amount of money that pushes it there might be smaller than you imagine

I'm sure there are a few of those guys but how do you find crypto in the first place? Unless you're just naturally wired to be a negative person, which of course some of them definitely are. If you see something you don't like you don't spend time on it. That's the peculiar thing about them.

This is what happens when you don't have Market competition. Coinbase is still the cheapest game in town when you look at all the additional fees
What I really don't get is Kraken knows they are more respected. They know the community stands behind them a lot more. This is an opportune time to drop their fees and allow Bank transfers and just absolutely Stick it to coinbase. They could own the market and take first place within 6 months no problem

Do you live in some third-world country? I mean that's not really a put-down statement it's an honest question because some countries like India just Lube up a dildo and shove it in their citizens when it comes to banking.  Some countries also get banned from even using Swift. I mean you still haven't told us what bank it is or what country you're in
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:02:20
Yeah I mean here's the thing I get how Kraken looks great on paper and how binance looked great on paper but you have withdrawal fees and they aren't exactly hidden they are clearly stated. The big problem with Kraken in America is they just don't take Bank deposits and they don't take checks. It's wire transfers and that's a 20 or $30 fee from your bank
You guys want to change this? Get off your ass and start fucking calling Kraken and messaging them. Lay out what you want to see and tell them you're interested. I'm not 100% sure why they don't want to mess around with taking Bank deposits but it would be nice to either get an answer or get them to do it
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:20:35
This is actually the way I look at things too. There are a bunch of idiots all over YouTube saying I'm going to short gold and I'm going to short stocks and all of this because they think there's going to be some crash that happened something like years ago. This time we have World banks that are going to inflate at any cost. Why the hell would you want to sell your good gold and good Bitcoin and even good shares of good companies for Fiat that's going to be pushed lower ? With zero or negative interest rates and more QE what in the world makes people think that that is the place to go?

The 5 dollar fee kills anything under a at least 1,000. Any amount smaller than that and coinbase is still a better deal. In fact one guy figured it out and it is something like 10,000 and up is where Kraken gets cheaper
@_date: 2019-10-07 08:27:35
You might not. I mean why I say they are great is because if you have an issue and I mean any issue you can talk to somebody almost immediately. They are straightforward and they have good management. For us in the USA the transfer fees going in suck. Hopefully for you it's not the case

Be happy the conversation has improved quite a bit in the past month or so in here. That's normally a really good sign. A lot of those fly-by-night gamblers are gone. 
I have no idea where the bottom is any more than anyone else. What I do remember is when we were trading in the mid 3s everyone was convinced we were going to go to 2k. 
Social media is overwhelmingly One Way convinced yet again
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:26:54
Yeah like other people have said you just got Auto moderated. If you want to make a legitimate comment and argument you can say something like it rhymes with it coin and people will figure out what you're saying pretty quick because you made a solid point. 
Another thing they like to say is inflation is only 2% a year. Okay, if that's true why have college costs gone up 5x in the past 20 years. Why is housing up 3 to 4x in that time and lower wage jobs like under 20 bucks an hour are up maybe 30% 
For a lot of people the standard of living since the year 2000 has actually gone down. College costs and rent payments take the majority of your paycheck if you're in the bottom 30%. Probably bottom 50%. The guys over at that particular sub tell you to stick all your money in an index fund and cost average, which isn't bad advice but it sure isn't going to get you ahead and if you're in that bottom 50% how much do you really have to shove in stocks? Most your money goes to staying alive. Bitcoin is really the only thing a lot of people have. It's the only hope they have actually getting something. Stocks aren't going to do it. Gold isn't going to do it even though gold is a good way to preserve your money it's not going to give you rapid growth. 
Like big picture so many of those guys in personal finance work 60 hours a week and plan on doing this for decades. My neighbor is worth about three million right now and he is 72 years old. He didn't become a millionaire until he was over 65. Dude worked his ass off his whole life. Now he has a little money and he's too old to enjoy it. I mean it was really sad the other day he gave me a $500 item just for chatting with him. He's like here if you don't need this go ahead and sell it at least get some use out of it because I'm not going to... that kind of hit me. Don't be a slave to the modern world

This particular subject has been around the dinner table a lot here in the United States. People are looking at gold and getting their money into properties. Basically reducing how much USD they have in the bank account and getting into hard assets
We would have more of these people in Bitcoin if there weren't so many goddamn gamblers, scammers and shillers. I mean if the price steadily started going up and just did that without people having freak out sessions dumping you would pull in a fuck ton more money

Agree, his marketing tactic has been fabrication and trying to appeal to emotionally distraught people.
I actually wasn't intentionally going that direction, my comments began by looking at suggested fees and electrum and Ledger. Most of the time they are pretty good but right now they are reading really high and when you look at a chart of transaction fees it looks like there's a spike. After further study and looking at the men pool it looks like there are just certain periods of the day where you might have a slow down and it's causing this to take place

Sit back and think about this one for a minute. What do you think the world would do if we took a hard money asset like gold and said we are confident there are only 3 million more ounces in the entire solar system. Only two million of those are on the earth and the last million will take a lot of effort to get. There was Rock Solid science to support this
Wouldn't you want to own a part of that? 
If you believe in the crypto space at all that comparison is true. Gold has its value because of trust. No other currency has stood the test of time for 5000 years. Bitcoin has value because of trust.. it's the oldest cryptocurrency and has stood the test of time while every other project ever created has not. Litecoin being the only notable exception which still has a good deal of value and was created not long after Bitcoin. 
Every monetary system Humanity has ever created besides gold and silver has gone to zero. Every cryptocurrency Humanity has ever created besides Bitcoin and my Litecoin example if you want to take it along has went to zero or near it. Someone Point me at a project from 2011 that is still being used besides those two? Anyone? That's my point. 
It doesn't matter if there's a better cryptocurrency developed. It doesn't matter if it can groom your dog and wash your hair. If that comes to Creation it only reinforces the value of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to ever fail trust in the space would also be forever compromised just like it would be if gold ever failed.

I think some of you guys miss how they are walking up the price doing this. No one is going to Market execute a giant order but you can buy what's available OTC and you can put a floor under all of the dips. If people get a little bit too leveraged run the price down and liquidate them. You can get to a pretty gigantic number just pulling a few btc off the exchanges every day along with whatever you can get OTC. Winklevoss twins have something like 210k btc. Who knows how many grayscale has but they were big time buyers back when all of you guys were selling in December. If the majority of the market starts believing 100 K or 200k is a foregone conclusion no one is going to be selling at these lower prices. Halving happens in just under a year and now the daily inflation rate is cut down. The smart miners are not going to be selling and all of a sudden it will become very easy to walk the price up. 
Pretty much everything is in place for that including all of the doubters. Tradingview is still littered with people calling for a new bottom which is exactly what we want to see as the price grinds higher

A lot of people are very aware. They just don't particularly care unless it affects them. We haven't actually had a truly fiscally conservative president since Clinton. That was the last time we ran a budget surplus. Trump wants to have windfall giveaways to the wealthy. I mean the stock BuyBacks have been just absolutely off the charts since he was elected. That's why the market is where it is. The companies are taking money saved in taxes and pumping it into share price. The left wants to spend like no tomorrow on subsidized College which really wouldn't be a bad idea if they would actually address the cost of doing such. Same with health care. Another good idea but not much of a discussion on how to make the cost reasonable. There just aren't many people who care about being fiscally conservative and responsible anymore
@_date: 2019-06-02 22:59:03
You can. Just doubt it will happen in our lifetimes. The trust gold has was built over thousands of years. Bitcoin we think of having that in crypto land but one of those reasons...big reasons is trust. It's the longest chain. Been around a decade. Most alts fail. Bitcoin does not. Nothing but time can improve that. If bitcoin is still in use 100 years from now I would expect the value to be far higher and the use more widespread. If scaling is not solved sidechains or backing something that does ala gold standard or in this case bitcoin standard on an alt seems likely

Honestly the order books give you a big hint. There just isn't that much for sale. One of these big funds who was probably accumulating the bottom decided this was their first price Target. 
The big issue I had with trading this one is 6800 was a potential resistance. 8600 was a potential resistance. 10k was a potential resistance. 11.7 also was. 
The move to where we went at least shows me they are trading on fibonacci's. You also had that signature move of a miniature blow off with a couple thousand dollar move in a day. Downside targets of 11.7, 10.5 to 10.8 and mid 8s are in play. If you look back to Bitcoin in 2016 and 2017 it was pretty common to have one of those 30% Corrections sometimes as much as 40% every few months. 
Big picture you want consolidation along the way up. You want support levels to form and you want the market to go sideways at times. When we approach 20,000 the most ideal scenario is to have a good base to go off of and for the price to just fly through that level. Not go to 20,000 and stall

That would be giving people an opportunity to get in. The other thing is a lot of the people who are holding Bitcoin don't want to sell at these low prices. The combination creates this really strong uptrend. 
If we look at all the unconfirmed transactions the numbers really aren't that high. There aren't that many people moving coins and a lot of those on confirmed transactions are people who paid really low transaction fees so they won't get cleared until the middle of the night.

This is early bull market. Masses and media won't go crazy until the later stages. They may start picking up once we break 20k but the hype won't begin until we are much higher.

It's crazy how much the psychology is lining up. I bought my first property January 2010 and when I was getting everything ready in 2009 every friend I had told me I was going to lose money. I should just rent. Prices are going to go lower. Prices actually did go lower for a couple more months and then we all know what happened. I'm up 2X and my mortgage payment is 1200 bucks and the house would rent right now for 2000/mo
What's even more crazy is property on the West Coast a lot of the common people think is too expensive but the investors are buying it up. I've been to home building projects that are already pre-sold to investors.
Currently a whole ton of people are really bearish on bitcoin.  I think a lot of the people who wanted to sell already have sold. The big money is likely waiting on the sidelines for the halving. When that takes place the supply will be constricted and strong hands already own most of the supply
We already know the masses are in a word stupid. When the price is going up they come around and when it's going down they come up with all the Bitcoin is dead stories
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:32:54
I've been following along since we first started working on this the problem is we don't really have widespread adoption. no exchanges or using it. Can you even set one up on any of the hardware wallets yet? I was hoping we would be further along before the bull market began for just this reason. I don't know how long you've been around but December 2017 actually November wasn't much better it's all people were talking about and we are going to head there again if things don't improve it's going to be $50 fees. Question is just when right now

I'm totally with this. I mean if you think big picture and you buy one for $3,500. Well okay. Let's just say it drops to $2,500 and you get the bear case to play out. How many months did you spend staring at the screen and watching videos and worrying and being involved and there still is no guarantee you're going to pull the trigger when that happens. So best case it's a thousand bucks which a lot of you should make in maybe a week or two  worth of work. Just isn't worth the added stress

Only from a market cap perspective which again doesn't mean a damn thing to me or you or really anyone. Its all about the X and maybe that's the thing. It's just not going to happen anymore because it takes too much money. If that's the case sooner or later people are going to start selling off. It's a risky asset with no upside
You have companies like Exxon and FedEx selling on a 50% off sale right now. In a few years a 2X isn't out of the question all that would be is getting back to the old highs and you know how World governments like to inflate. Strictly from a risk perspective if bitcoin is only going to do a 2X it really doesn't look that great. You have some smart people and good developers and a whole bunch of idiots in the Bitcoin space. How is this attractive?
In 2016 and 2017 people were picking up dips. You had General optimism. None of that is present right now. You have idiot gamblers. Wall Street trying to figure out how to capitalize on this and that might be a big short and a sub with almost no one from the 2017 run. I mean I don't recognize hardly any of the names anymore. It really puts some weight on the scenario of 14000 being the lower high in the grand scheme and it being a grind lower from here. If we don't pick up from here it will be 4 red months in a row. That Hasn't happened in an uptrend since Bitcoin was born

Scaling and actual use case is definitely the main obstacle. I think lightning is going to be a useful tool the problem is hardly anyone is using it. The lack of good apps that make it point and click easy-to-use is one of the big hurdles right now. If we want Bitcoin to catch on ideally it becomes a situation where you can use it like PayPal. You click a button and it takes Fiat out of your bank account converts it to bitcoin and sends it. When we get that you're going to see a lot more people using it
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:27:40

They have been floating that idea for over a year. It's basically their Think Tank . brainstorming. Not actual policy. However if growth in the United States and Europe continues to decelerate you are going to see the central bank's get inflationary and consider things like this. Hard assets are going to rise and the poor are going to get a dry dildo.
Extremely strong case for owning gold, silver, property etc on the traditional side. Should also be a positive for crypto. There will be a lot of money sloshing around to go into it and hopefully we can develop the inflation Hedge narrative

Use your PC dude. Don't be a knuckle dragger living on his phone. 
Kraken is definitely the best of the American exchanges the problem is going to be getting money to them. In a word they fucking suck when it comes to deposits. The reason why is you have to pay your bank for a wire transfer. That's twenty or thirty bucks all by itself. You can't even do a check deposit. I mean I'm not defending coinbase as it would be fun to drop my nutsack on Brian's head but when you look at all of the fees combined they really rule the market when it comes to $100 purchases simply because you can deposit money from your bank account with no fees whatsoever. Add in the fact you can withdraw Bitcoin for no fees whatsoever and it's not a bad deal. Kraken currently has a withdrawal fee, no cheap way to deposit and while I agree they are a better business with better management and way fucking better customer service it's just not ideal for a lot of people

@_date: 2019-02-17 21:57:55
I think you have that a little off. The real acceleration was from 1946 to y2k. Since then the recovery of 2003 was short-lived and after that it's been a lot of low growth + inflation. If you look at the FED funds rate right now at 2.25% and the CPI at 2.1% that's nearly an effective zero rate and we have declining GDP along with a growing deficit. People might say the deficit has been some ridiculous number for years, that is true, however it's accelerating. That's the troubling part
@_date: 2019-02-07 07:47:05
The example I like to use is like designer clothing. You can buy a Prada handbag for $3,500 or you can buy the Chinese knockoff for $100. That's a pretty easy way to explain Bitcoin cash I find with most people. 
As for the cost, let me break that down. Is it cheaper for them to prop the value up as more people get out of it or if you are coins are in float? Yes but there is a huge caveat. We cannot only see how many transactions are in each block but it still costs them all that electricity in mining so if people aren't actually buying the coins and they are just selling them to themselves they are burning up countless dollars and electricity and miners to keep the network going. The real clue is going to be with network transactions and they are pretty damn low. This would actually be the textbook perfect capitulation. If Bitcoin cash or bitmain goes down and fails there's going to be a lot of crypto put on the market. Litecoin might go to single digits. Bitcoin might briefly dip under 2,000. It would be the most glorious time ever because you would create an actual bottom and have a lot of optimism afterwards. Bitcoin cash would be destroyed. There would be no more overhead or worry and you would break some of the most toxic players. For people who actually believe in the future of Bitcoin it would be a Black Friday sale and not likely to last long

Depends on how much stimulus you need to become interested. there have been a lot of little developments. Most importantly there haven't been any drawbacks. Nothing that throws the future of Bitcoin in jeopardy. It's actually been exceedingly positive. Really the big thing people are waiting on us to feel like the bottom is in. That's either going to mean we consistently uptrend and start taking out prior pivots especially getting back over 6000 or we have a true capitulation bottom where you see massive buying pressure come in and turn it around

Well that would probably be because the majority of people respond to crimes emotionally rather than logically. It's one of the reasons our criminal justice system is so messed up.
My favorite ones are sex crimes. Some coach bangs out of 15 year old girl and you know exactly what people say. Now if it's turned around and it's a hot girl with a 15 year old boy that's completely different. Emotional responses, not logical ones. You also might notice the people say break them off give them tons of time. Okay if we do this what exactly do you do with someone who does much worse? How do you justify the sentence of one person who did something relatively minor and another guy who does something much much worse? Typically what you hear is people just get emotionally upset about practically every crime unless it's one they're involved with and if it is then that one is okay

Look how some people have been using it. I mean you can see what we see or you can say it's nothing but a gambling device people buy drugs with which is the opinion of some people. Perhaps he took a casual glance at it and that was what he noticed. Historically a lot of projects that goes straight up don't have a happy ending so there is that too.
I mean spending $3,400 on a single Bitcoin right now could be very cheap or extremely expensive depending on your point of view. We are being paid to take that risk. There is no guarantee $3,400 is going to become 34,000. That said the risks does seem smaller than the people who were buying in 2011. There was a major risk it was all going to go up in smoke. Now we have major institutions building and some deep-pocketed investors who are going to make their presence known at some point. You guys do realize that one of the main ways a bear Market ends is when some very wealthy people put their foot down and say okay this is the bottom. Up we go. 
We can all guess on where that might be but one major benefit of driving the prices lower is it's going to break Roger ver and help speed the demise of Bitcoin cash which is something that just needs to be put out of its misery for the health of the crypto space. I definitely do my part in trying to demoralize those guys. Every little bit helps I would like to think

Keep studying. One really good place you can sign up for a free Weekly Newsletter is hedgeye.com it's ran by a guy with a good trading track record who used to manage a hedge fund and now does institutional research along with managing his own money. There are paid plans of course but even the free newsletter and sign up keeps you posted on what's going on with out all of the marketing bullshit bias of financial Network TV
Lastly, the one reason I mention getting into a home is because you can lock in that payment and pretty much everything I see has rents increasing over the next 10 years from that inflation. If that happens not only do you maintain the lower rent payment or mortgage payment but you also gain some degree of equity.

That definitely has been what the majority of statements coming out of the government have been pointing to.

 Everyone who's been around more than a year or so has probably figured out what the deal is. That deal is a lot of people are really really and I truly mean really stupid. They chase price. If it's trending up and making a new high every month no matter how much they resist eventually a lot of those gamblers are going to start buying. They don't care what it is and they don't care about anything other than the trend. Those same people are who have been capitulating all year. Price go down, they don't want it. Now sit back and think about how easy that crowd is to manipulate. All you have to do is run the price down and accumulate as much as possible . take some of that money you made shorting and start running the price up again. guess what happens? To make it even more effective you do this over a period Of years. Even more people can't stand waiting so the time will drive them out as well.

This mentality is honestly part of what brought me to bitcoin quite some time ago. It seemed obvious that if you could Corner the supply you can drive the price to wherever you wanted and really not have much to worry about because you would only have a slow trickle of coin feeding out going to the people wanting to pay whatever price you set.
The masses will run from Bitcoin when they see it go from 20,000 down to 3000 calling it dead multiple times along the way. The same people who refused to buy Bitcoin at 3,000 will be more than happy to pay 50,000 if they think the potential of it going to a hundred thousand or more is very good. People buy trends. 
The "geniuses" who bought btc 3k now sell bits to people above 100k letting them have the hope of 200k+ 
The really crazy part is this is what has been in play for the past decade and there are no signs it is stopping now, it's just getting more advanced with deeper pockets playing in the pool
I'm also nearly positive this strategy is at work in bcash. The demand for that stuff is really not that great but the price swings are pretty substantial. That's what happens when you have a low float
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:48:46
It might but they will sell when their 1000 is 500 or 2000 never really knowing. All I know is ever since btc was a dollar people said oh this amount will never amount to much. You missed your chance. It was 1 cent at the start. A dollar is 100x. It's over
I have no idea where the top is either but it's likely higher than most expect.
No one expected 1k in 2013. No one expected 20k in 2017. Heavy selling in sept scared people half to death. 6k has to be the top and on an x gain its 6x the last high. If we do hit 100k I'm certain people will take profit there even if it isnt the ultimate high. People get off the bus along the way. Always have
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:35:24
I've still never really got that about crypto and I've been around quite awhile. Someone starts buying a lot of Bitcoin and for some insane reason all of the altcoins go up lockstep. They should be going down because they trade against Bitcoin. It makes them more expensive to purchase but yet then go up oftentimes even more. I mean it just really gives you the feeling that there are hedge funds that have these giant baskets and everything is just labeled cryptocurrency . They have a buy and a sell button

I'm not completely convinced we are going to get one. Traditional markets have been consolidating for a year-and-a-half basically. I mean truly we haven't gone anywhere.
If we do go into a recession it's likely to be mild but what I think is going to happen is we are looking at multiple years of slower growth. Interest rates especially in Europe are as low as realistically possible. I mean the German Bund is like negative .2% on a 10-year. To prevent the global economy from going into a nasty recession central banks are going to keep rates low and the money flowing. This is actually really bullish for Bitcoin. It's bullish for gold too. And property, and probably stocks. It's just asset inflation. I think this is the likely remedy to avoid another large-scale crash

Because purchasing power gets inflated away. If the world bank's do what it looks like they are going to do and that is inflate even more the place you want to be is in hard assets. Gold, silver, housing, land.

Wages have no risen accordingly. There is no actual real growth. Even if we look at the fake cpi and fed rate you have an effective 0% borrowing rate

@_date: 2019-02-17 22:46:47
I don't really see how without actual cuts and neither party is even considering those. The most likely scenario is going to be asset inflation which lets them control the descent of standard of living. It's kind of a crazy path though because as that starts happening you're going to see more far-left candidates become popular. If they start trying to tax the wealthy at very very high rates the wealthy just get on a plane and fly to another country. The big problem is the rate of debt is accelerating. Normally we would be running a budget surplus at this point in the economic cycle but with the Trump tax cuts it's just more deficit spending in order to juice returns a little bit longer. 
The other thing that could really paint a positive picture is if we had productivity gains but I don't see anything on the horizon that is going to accomplish those. Perhaps ai and robotic workers but if that happens you create a larger minimum wage unemployed populous and start looking at things like basic income which again would probably be more deficit spending.
What do I think all of this equals in the big picture? Get your hands on a house. Find a loan where you can put just a couple percent down. You might get a really good deal in the next couple years if things go south. Hard assets like gold and silver I can see doing really well over the next decade. If they rapidly inflate the currency people are going to be looking at Hedges and if you look at the history of gold it does the best when Fiat is rapidly inflating. It's no surprise that the best run it's done recently was during QE

@_date: 2019-06-27 16:18:39
That move yesterday all took place in one 10 minute candle bar for the most part.
The coinbase excuse was convenient which makes you wonder if this was just a way to set up institutional distribution. If so and it sure looks that way to me, you have to suspect their own involvement
It was at a technical resistance level and we did have the signature micro blow off top, all that would have made sense but the coinbase thing was just a little weird
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:50:12
If the fees stay where they are between 3 and $6 and if you get a lower hour you can probably get that down to like a buck 50 maybe $2. That's fine. What's getting me is this cycle just began. There's not that much new retail interest yet. I'm looking ahead. I'm not sure if you have checked out Google trends lately  but it's like not even on the same Planet as 2017. If that starts happening again and we don't have a lot of lightning Outlets setup or everyone on segwit you're going to see 2017 repeat and that's going to be terrible. 
Right now is not my concern, next year is. If we spike to north of 40 dollar fees and back up trasactions that's going to.. well... not be a good thing for Price or for adoption
@_date: 2019-02-09 08:08:51
Which is exactly what should not happen. Let's say we are talkin about bcash. It's something like $100. Bitcoin goes up 10%. Bcash should be 90 dollars or 10% less because bitcoin strengthened. That doesnt usually happen. What happens is a lot of alts move up the same to more like these big money funds are spreading their dollars across baskets of assets. Since we know it takes considerably more money to move Bitcoin versus all of the other garbage it's probably easier to squeeze trash coins but it still shows fund flows going into them
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:59:58
I completely agree and I just got that article about coinbase adopting lightning which sounds amazing. Also glad to see everybody using 3 wallets.

They had been using base layer wallets forever.

Tips 
You're not going to make a lot of money but it's an index to inflation. Personally I think the long-term outlook for gold and silver is really good. The big thought behind that is the central banks are going to run the inflation engine. Historically that has been extremely bullish for gold

There's really no reason that triggered this. A lot of us have been looking at. 10k 11.8 and now the that high 13k level as potential areas of distribution. We have to consolidate and build a higher low. Price has been advancing too fast. It's nothing to worry about and all we did is tap the 21 exponential on the 4-Hour chart. In 2017 we used to hit the 50 simple frequently on the 4-Hour. That would be around 10.5 to 10.7 which is a potential bottoming Zone if this turns into a correction

Completely agree. When capitulation happens people are going to know it.
Realistically even if we were going to talk about a grind higher we have to clear that $4,300 pivot and we never have been able to since we fell under it. What happens over and over is they engineer these little pumps and get the new people really bullish only to unload all over their face

With all the problems people have had over the past year in trying to utilize this the safest strategy if you want to tax dodge really seems to be buying gold from apmex or jm bullion with your btc and then hustling the gold for cash on Craigslist or local ads

It's still above a meg
Honestly though, I hope they have some kind of contingency plan for when things get going again. If it's a very minor block size increase. If lightning will be ready. Making segwit more available or pushing exchanges to all use it. I really don't care which method they use as long as it's universally accepted and it works
@_date: 2019-10-06 07:26:06
A lot of it is the media we have on TV. They are doing such a job of fear-mongering. People are just looking at it from the wrong perspective. There is this false belief that the u.s. dollar is the most Rock Solid thing the world has ever known. So much so I hear people talking about selling gold to go to cash even or selling land to go to cash. Never mind that for the past five thousand years real wealth was owning the land and owning the gold. They did the same thing in 2009 and the wealthy bought up the majority of the foreclosed homes. The same thing will happen now. They will buy up all the stock they sell and they will buy up all the homes they leave and the people who have that cash will find when they want that stuff back they will be paying more for it. I think it's just a testament to the predictability of the human being. The first thing they think of is it will be just like 2009 because that is what is familiar to them.

Just for the sake of Simplicity opening an account at Kraken would probably be the way to go. They have a simple interface when you first log in and then there is the exchange side and sometimes you have to hunt for a way to get to it. You will know when you get there because it has a black background and a lot of charting. They also have excellent customer support so it will be no problem doing your deposit and no problem doing a withdrawal
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:32:10
Stop being such a pussy coinbase is what it is. It takes awhile for the funds to clear it's always been that way. Every single exchange out there has some kind of quirk. One of my favorites is Kraken but they suck for smaller transactions. With coinbase Pro you can withdraw your Bitcoin for free which still makes it a pretty good deal even though they did Jack the rates.
Be patient, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. There just aren't that many good options in the United States

When I read stuff like this I'm just hoping Fidelity actually has a solution that involves a real crypto even if it is just Bitcoin. Some kind of trustworthy outfit that American customers can easily use because bitmex wants nothing to do with anyone from America. Neither does deribit.

It sucks because it's an additional fee but when you get right down to it you're absolutely right, they are still the best deal in town. I have been a kraken cheerleader for years but they have some real fucking issues that they won't do anything about. Number one there is a withdrawal fee. Number two they don't take Bank deposits or check deposits. That means you have to spend 20 or $30 on a Wire. I think there is another system foreigners can use but honestly who gives a fuck about someone who doesn't live in America? Am I right? Rest of the world is just made for our freedom eagles to go exploit.

Why don't you sit and think about what happens if you do nothing? If your reply is something like not my problem congratulations you are a big part of why the world is in the situation it is. Society cannot continue to function without a thought for the person next to them. The attitude of I don't care what happens to the other guy as long as I get mine is not sustainable. 
What have you or any of you done to improve the situation? Because I can answer that . I hire felons if they have the skills and education to do the job. Want to take a stab at what percentage of the homeless population is made up of Able Body working adults that can't get a job because Society discriminates against anyone with a crime? Fixing this one thing would save us billions. If you want to see change maybe you should start with yourself

The biggest benefits are with Bitcoin your money is on the blockchain. It's censorship resistant and not subject to a third party aka centralization. 
The other issue is the rest of the world. Zelle only works in the west and how are they making money? Is it a promotion? Someone pays fees if you have a company that needs payroll. PayPal lets you send cash on their friends and family deal as well but makes money on Merchant transactions. 
One of the biggest perks to bitcoin and that is being decentralized also has been a problem. The problem is a lack of money for development. Lightning needs to be perfected and when it is you will have a product that functions like the centralized payment apps but is completely decentralized. No back end fees etc
@_date: 2019-12-29 08:02:36
Yeah but even with that thinking. Answer the magic question. Why do you need Bitcoin? I mean if you live in a western country you don't really need it. It's fun to speculate with. I like what it stands for but the argument isn't that much different than a gold coin. Why do you really need a gold coin? You don't really need it but there's a lot of reasons you want to own one or 2 or 10. The number of scammers in the crypto space is definitely a major drawback to getting more people on board right now. That's one thing I would like to see get cleaned up

It's very confusing at first and you have to understand you're at a disadvantage and you don't know much so don't make rash choices. Keep learning and keep listening and as the months go by you will get more comfortable
Also don't fall victim to the alt coin marketing. Most of them have no purpose and no future. Ask yourself what they really do and how they will make money? The only one that has a truly active development Community right now is ethereum. If you invest a small amount and I mean under 10% of your crypto Holdings in that you will probably be okay but coinmarket cap is full of garbage. Most alt coins are on a one-way Street down after their initial pumps. Stay 90% btc

It's not really that, it's that he got a sentence far and above what he should have. You look around at what some other people have done and they have gotten considerably less. I'm definitely not in the camp that says he should be set free right now or that he didn't do anything. It's more that double life is extreme for what he did do
It's like giving someone 5 years for stealing a car. It's happened but the poor sap that got that sentence is at the extreme top end of the sentencing range

It's either going to fail or get considerably more expensive. I would imagine we are going to see a reduction in volatility just with this next halving. I mean that's reducing the number of coins in float quite a lot. Some of the statistics show that over 65% of the Bitcoin with over 1 BTC have not moved in over a year. I'm part of that statistic. I just don't think it's worth it to transfer into Fiat at such low prices. Bitcoin is only going to get harder and more expensive to get your hands on in the future. In a few months the number of new coins gets cut in half. Each day of the number of new coins gets that much smaller.
The only way I can see crazy price swings is it the volume gets really thin which it actually is right now. The actual number of coins necessary to move the price $100 is really not that large

Not necessarily there have been some really pro-market Democrats. Kennedy was probably the best one since World War II. Clinton actually ran a budget surplus.  I don't think the new breed of socialist really resonates with the majority of the population but it does with people who are really poor and it's understandable why. If I didn't have much the first guy I would vote for is Bernie Sanders. If we don't want him winning then people have to have opportunity. The cost of college has went up exponentially and has done so on the back of low interest rate loans. The bankers are making the profit and the kids today are paying for it. Cutting government spending sounds like a good idea in theory the problem is where you start. Wasteful programs would be the first but Healthcare and entitlements. You do that and you're not going to get reelected. They will devalue the dollar first which is exactly the way it's going if you look at the value of the dollar versus a hard asset like gold or property. It takes more and more dollars to buy either one. I think more than anything a Monumental shift in how people think is necessary. The idea of your either left or right needs to go away. There needs to be more focus on agreements and progress than simply winning at any cost and hating the party you don't belong to. The marketers have created these wedge issues. It's very possible to agree with points the Republicans make and agree with points the Democrats make and argue each independently. I think when people begin to have the ability to do that we will see higher quality candidates emerge. People will simply demand them
Something I would love to see in high school would be political science where people have to argue Democrat and Republican points and do so effectively. Regardless of which side people lean on they would ultimately make better choices if they actually understood the other

The conservative channels that have been censored have also been reporting blatantly fabricated information. There is some truth to this since a lot of the major tech companies are refusing ad money from political sponsors that do not have factual videos or ads. It's literally for the good of society. If you want to be a conservative that's fine but you need to offer factual videos with credible sources. No one is attacking justin amash for example.  Very conservative and very honest and factual. Alex Jones types or the youtube idiot greg hunter have more in common with the National Enquirer and promote deceptive news practices. There are thousands and thousands of people that fall for that kind of content and it distorts their reality from what's really happening. Flat earth. Faked moon landing.

I think people saying that are looking for a reason to blame for their own problems. Almost every single person alive has experienced some type of trauma. What matters is how you deal with it. If you sit around and say oh my gosh this happened to me when I was five your entire life how exactly does that help you ? strong people overcome adversity. I know a guy with the felony who's worth a few million dollars. Got turned down for all kinds of jobs and it gave him one hell of a drive to succeed. I know a girl who lost her virginity to her dad when she was 11. She has a healthy relationship and a good family. That's just in my own Circle of Friends. Messed up things happen and they aren't okay but if you just dwell on them the only person that pays for that is yourself
On the relationship front I'm reasonably sure I know why a lot of people struggle. We didn't have healthy examples growing up. How are you supposed to know how to have a completely functional relationship when you did not get to see that with your own parents? I think those of us who are aware of that begin to study and read and learn how to be healthy but it's not something you're just born with. People have a habit of going after what they are used to and if what they are used to is broken it's no surprise they find it again

It literally needs nothing more than better development in the apps. It would be in the realm of possibility to develop an app that is nothing more than pushing a couple of buttons to make payments.

I've been at this for years. My best advice is watch all of the videos from Andreas Antonopoulos. Read the book digital gold and also the Bitcoin standard. Read the internet of money. Don't take what you hear from crypto channels on YouTube as gospel. They are wrong a lot. I can tell you I am 100% certain a lot of what's being spread around about plus token right now is not accurate. It's regurgitated information that was published in August. 
Most important just stick around and dollar cost average into Bitcoin when you have some free money. Once you get over a couple hundred dollars worth it's worth investing in a ledger Nano s. I think they are like $30 now or something and it gives you control of your own keys. If you don't know what that means yet you will after you do what I just told you above

Cnn or fox is not the point in name. It specifically is referring to political ads and if they are factually based. Do you even know how to use Snopes to dig into fact-checking a specific article?
The problem with freedom of speech is I have watched it destroy Society. The marketers have taken advantage of it and there are groups of people that believe a reality that doesn't even exist. I can understand how some would say well if they are that stupid they get what they get. Fair point but it's leading to vote manipulation and a fractured Society.
For example if you're going to defend the Republican Party. What have you personally gotten out of this tax plan? How does it benefit you?

You're probably best served just buying a ledger Nano s from the get-go as cheap as they are. There are something like 30 to $40 now and there is no purpose in holding anything else besides the big 2.  I really would not look past btc and eth. They are the only two that actually have a development community and real things going on. 90% btc 10% eth could make sense or 95% and 5%. Everything else is either a dead project, hype or in the case of things like Litecoin it's a good project but it has a dying community. All of the development in crypto right now is around Bitcoin and what's not around Bitcoin is around ethereum. The overwhelming majority of alts have no purpose. No active development and no future. It's all hype

Which was made out of a variety of things. Myans looked at jade as extremely valuable. To them it was. Gold was popular in Europe and africa. You simply can't explain the value based on saying it was used for jewelry or that it's an electrical conductor or even that it doesn't corrode. Platinum for example is extremely corrosion-resistant. Until somewhat recently in history it was not even seen as all that valuable. Physically it looks like silver it just never tarnishes.  It's also quite a lot more rare on this planet than gold
Bitcoin has value because people believe it does
Gold has value because people believe it does
If things were truly priced based on Rarity or usability oil would be well over $1,000 a barrel. 
If you guys want to tell yourself that the reason something has value is whatever it is you make up in your head that is totally your choice but it doesn't make it accurate. There is no rational explanation why gold or Bitcoin actually has value when you get down to it. Both do because we believe they do. If you tried to counterfeit either one they would not have that perceived value even if they were capable of doing the same thing

Looking at the chart no. Bitcoin is in a downtrend. However bottoms are extremely hard to call and this is a potential reversal Zone
Looking at Price history this is a decent time to buy. For the past couple years Bitcoin has been sucked to the $6,000 range. Price Discovery is also taking place with a rather small number of coins and leverage Traders. If you can handle buying one and just kicking back letting it do its thing you're good. If you check the price every 5 minutes and can't handle losses wait for an uptrend to get established

That's part of the problem though I mean I never would have gotten involved if mining didn't exist. Today, it really doesn't. you can't mine out of your house anymore. When you start racking your brain for how to onboard people and get them to pay attention to people like Andreas Antonopoulos. Mining on your gaming rig was a really good way to get people involved and learning. You would start out with an altcoin or in my case ether. Then you learn about Bitcoin and the entire market and it goes from there. I don't think I would have put one single US dollar into Bitcoin if I didn't get into it via my gaming computer first

They are silencing people who are blatantly lying. Do you ever dig into some of what you're being told? I mean one of the most obvious examples is the right-wing position of anti climate science. I have seen with my own eyes classified government documents outline military plans for the continued effects of climate change. It's not even an if it's a fact. Yet we have a political party that uses it as a wedge issue simply because they don't want you to agree with the left. It helps control your vote. How can you take a party like that seriously? I know the left has some issues and that's just the nature of our current political environment with special interests having more control than they should but the fabricated news needs to stop. Things are either true or they are not true and that's how people need to start thinking again because right now they aren't doing that.

There's limits to what I can reveal about what I've read but the main impacts are very gradual. It's not a Tipping Point. It's a gradual process. You can even look at major companies like ExxonMobil who have entire Pages devoted to the effects of climate change. I mean doesn't that tell you something when the biggest oil giant short of aramco has a page like that? This isn't one of those things where you're going to wake up one day and it's all over. It's a gradual decline from carbon emissions which have an impact on the weather system and overall climate of the planet. A lot of capital is being invested into some wickedly cool nuclear technology right now. It's much safer than anything most of you could even imagine existing. Bill Gates was actually going to start a trial run of these reactors in China in 2016-2017 , that was of course put on hold when Trump was elected and the tariffs came into play. One of his philanthropy projects was the capital behind the development. The near-term impacts of climate change are going to be seen with an increased frequency of wildfire. Drought and pollution related health issues. As time progresses by the year 2050 it's going to be substantially worse if we don't pull back the carbon emissions. Currently someone in the developed World uses roughly 13 barrels of oil per year. In the developing world that's only three. By 2050 it's projected to be 4 or greater. That kind of growth only will accelerate the process. It's simply unsustainable big picture. How do you use infinite resources on a finite planet? That's really the issue and the same with population growth. For the past hundred years it has grown exponentially . it cannot continue at that rate. That's just simply math

Not at all. Both are psychological phenomenon in your mind. You see value in both because the rest of society does. 
What makes this particular proposition a little more difficult is separating fad pricing from real. We all trust gold in fact if you're actually honest with yourself and you were forced to hold it for 50 years there are some of us who would take gold over Bitcoin and the only reason that would be is because we know the chances of gold holding its value in 50 years are higher. Why ? Because Society has asigned value to it for thousands of years. We know people are traditional. In fact there are some people that really really live their life in a traditional sense and they tell themselves everyday why it makes sense even if it absolutely does not. 
Why does Bitcoin have more value than every other cryptocurrency out there? When you get down to it there is only one real answer. Trust. That one word is why. People trust the network security. The devs. The image. Litecoin can do most anything bitcoin does but is currently valued at roughly 280 for 4 coins vs 5300 for 1 btc just to put their float at the same level. Why? Trust. A new bitcoin fork may not even be worth 1 cent. Why. Trust. Trust is what gives money its value

There are no credible studies that are not paid for by think tanks showing ice levels are increasing year-over-year.

Who gets elected by crashing the economy or re-elected I should say? No one. Case in point the past 2 democratic presidents we had were in office under booming economies. Also noteworthy Clinton is the only deficit-neutral President we have had in my lifetime.

Big picture how is the myth of growth going to continue? From 1900 until 2000 the people alive grew up in an age of expansion.

How do you have infinite growth with finite resources

Have you guys heard that conspiracy theory going around about those two actually working together on all this? Here's how it goes. Good cop bad cop routine. Craig says and does a lot of crazy stuff to get people to hate him. They have the fork. The price of the entire crypto Market falls through the floor. This allows them to buy more bch or even BTC on sale but it's especially effective on bch since they both had a ton of it. Since the value of that was really hurt on the fork they sell off bsv and pour into bch at extremely low prices to reduce the float. Bsv was a throwaway chain from the beginning. If this actually happened both of them now have more bch and will be able to manipulate it higher much easier. The naive big blockers supporting bsv get taken advantage of and a lot of those guys are likely to put their money into bch once this dies. It's a hell of a scheme for a pump

24k is really soft. Adding roughy 8% copper for 22k greatly increases durability. If you look at gold coins that were actually used for currency they are all 92% gold alloy. Pre 1933 us gold coins are a good example and it's also why all the gold in Fort Knox is the same purity, not 24-karat like a lot of other Global banks that keep bullion Reserves.
All those gold bars in Fort Knox to the best of public knowledge are just melted down gold coins from the confiscation of 1933

Not. Its valuable because people believe it is. Huge history. Humans are traditional people. If people see something over generations they assume its fact.

I mean I've heard this argument about real estate and in bubbles you can get appreciation like that but if we look around the country and you look at the bottom of the real estate market. The average home in a good city is up a little over 100%. Maybe a 110% the purchasing power of the dollar since 2010 is down so why would you not have a lot of extra cash in real estate? You can say the same thing for the S&amp;P 500 and you very quickly realize why the wealthy have most of their money in assets
The question I can't figure out is why Bitcoin isn't catching on any quicker. If you would take any other asset and say over the past 10 years how much it's been up on average every year people would be fighting each other to get into that fund. With Bitcoin the second you say that word there are quite a lot of people who just think it can't last and it will never continue or some other negative thing

You simply don't get it
Maybe it's easier if you think about Bitcoin. Why does it have value? Because people believe it does. No other reason
You could make an exact copy to do the exact same thing and it would be priced much less just like all of the other Forks. The reason counterfeit Bitcoin doesn't have the value is because people believe it doesn't.
You could make everything else exactly the same and it's still would not have the value
Gold does not derive its value from conductivity. A thousand years ago that did not matter and it was still the world currency

True. The real deal with gold is that it is an inflation hedge. Back in the day a nice home around ww2 was 7k usd. Gold was locked to 35/oz then. 200oz bought the home. Today 200oz is 260k or the price of a home in a non tech boom city. Averaged out gold gains against the usd but trails business as you point out with the spx beating it silly over the past 50 years

That's an old article and they aren't looking for strategies that's a brainstorming article you read it's how they can make negative interest rates actually work and it doesn't mean they are going to do it it just means they are exploring the option if they ever have to get to that point
If they do gold, land and hopefully Bitcoin will be the things to own because hard assets are going to greatly appreciate

It really all depends on the price point. If you can get a 1080 for the same price I would go that way but you can overclock a 1070 TI to get really similar to a 1080. The 1080 is a slightly better card as it is just a little bit more efficient mining most of the algorithms and it's also a little bit better for gaming but it's a very very slight thing. I would not pay more than $50 extra for a 1080 but if you can get one around the same price go that way

If you look at the stochastic on the monthly candle. Same charts. It also lines up perfectly with what you just posted. We are basically in January of 2015 almost to the letter.

Give it time. If you think through that thought you just made they are interrelated. If someone can look at the earnings of coinbase the first thing they think of is where are the earnings coming from. If you look at Bitcoin in a very basic way what you have is a legalized gambling parlor. They could look at it that way. If you look at it from a technology perspective, you have a technology that can move very large amounts of money much cheaper than conventional Banks. You have a technology that as it develops can offer lower fees for common transactions. About an hour ago I did a $350 sale. Customer swipes their credit card. We get 340 and change. That right there is the target. Think about all those small business owners out there using Square to swipe people. If people have the ability to pay with Bitcoin and could use it all easily you have a real threat to visa and MasterCard. It would not be hard to develop a side chain that even has the safety mechanisms like a customer service department. Chargeback protection. That might cost a little bit more but it gives businesses a chance to innovate on the blockchain. It also provides that real world use case rather than the one we have now which is basically digital cash

Step back for a minute. Look at this with clean eyes. This is probably not going to be the final iteration but if a company like Sony can make Bitcoin very easy to use. Something where a person can pick it up and just push a button. That's huge. Right now using Bitcoin is kind of like using email in the early days. The bulletin boards. It wasn't really difficult but you had to know what you were doing. Now you type a couple of numbers or letters and you click the send button.

That's pretty much it. If a recession come sooner the inflation is going to be even worse. You guys may notice the FED is on a hike schedule.

It's pretty well documented. You can search for topics like the anabolic Control Act. There have been a few of them over the years. Lyle Alzado was a huge talking point back when the first one was passed. 
I can tell you without a doubt those laws were passed not to save people. Not because they cared about people but because they cared about the image and they don't want role models for kids being involved with steroids. It's kind of like the anti-drug mentality. There are a lot of very conservative people who think movie stars that might have a joint in their mouth are absolutely terrible role models for their kids while ignoring everything else about the person. When you read about the history you will shake your head because those hormones should have always been left in the hands of doctors.
There's also a movie on Netflix called Icarus that you will really enjoy. It has more to do with cycling and drug use their but you get to listen to interviews with the top Russian doping doctor and how they design Cycles for endurance athletes

Did you actually read the report? There's not a lot in there that's dovish the only thing that is is the acknowledgement that we might be closer to neutral. I think the actual wording was something like close to neutral rather than before when it was a long ways off sounding. He directly pointed out equities looked expensive by historical standards which everyone that looked at the S&amp;P p/e ratio has known. GDP is slowing into 2019 and we have floaty pe's. The news definitely spun it in a positive way and that was the reaction we got. I just don't honestly see how we are going to make higher highs when earnings are going to fall into next year

mmm 2021 is my target year. run may start in 2020 but more demand and half the supply is a major positive. once we break through 20k quite a lot of people will be flowing back just like when we went above $1000 last time. the run from 20k to 50k and likely 95-100k will be the fun part. getting to a low target next year in the 10-15k range would not surprise me however

A few have made the transition. Most seem to panic sell bottoms and if they dont do that they sell at break even or slightly up only to watch it keep moving in the direction they just didn't think it could go. This modern skeptic internet generation has no patience and it's breaking them.
Right now all someone has to do is buy a little bit and wait till, probably about 2023

Markets are more likely to see continuation than differentiation
Every time we have a bear Market in any Market people come up with perfectly rational explanations to explain why this time is different. Why things are not going to come back this time. And they are always wrong. You may notice they do exactly the same thing at Peaks. This Time It's Different. This is why it's going substantially higher . and each time they are wrong. I think the overwhelming majority of the population has this emotional decision making process going on in their brain. It's something I don't. I'm not emotional at all really. Like when I was younger I watched someone get killed in front of me and it didn't even phase me. I went back to eating my lunch and didn't give it a second thought. Now that may seem bizarre but it's just how I'm wired and it's been really beneficial to understanding markets. What I have noticed is most people tend to have very strong emotional reactions at Market extremes and I use that to figure out where we are in Cycles along with technical indicators and even fundamental ones.
I think there is a reasonable probability where we are now is the same as January 2015. The s&amp;p500 is also at a major turning point. I don't actually expect the markets to unload until late next year but we are seeing the first cracks in this decade-long bull market

I'm just thinking reading some of your posts. There are only a handful of accounts that came on around December 2017 that still post. I'm fairly sure it's been this way since the beginning. Only a small sliver of people stick around. It's why Bitcoin has done a nearly parabolic run over the past decade and there are only a few millionaires.

Lots of people are technical dunces and that's the great part.  You bring them to market. 
Look at the timeline from just a few years ago. Mining required the ability to follow directions and not make mistakes. Wallets required a seed and very good understanding of security.

You will never know the bottom until a few months after we create one. If this flush truly is a bottom you want to see price action support it. Ideally we should be back in the $5,000 range within a couple weeks and maintain it. It's still ridiculously possible that we are going to create a lower low. It just depends on who is selling. The really optimistic thing is the hashwar seems to be calming down a little. Lord only knows how much BTC Craig was selling to support his project. Or Roger for that matter. Those two were straight up dumping right into Market Lows

They just want to see a trust in custody solution. I'm not sure what Bloomberg has reported but I have read the SEC statement. We are definitely getting in ETF. It just might be later in 2019 than some people are expecting. Baakt is going to happen before the ETF does. Once they have a legitimate custody solution, which by the way Ledger is now getting involved with institutional custody. Then we can talk about an ETF. 
The whole time frame is becoming exceedingly obvious. You start putting these things in place later on in 2019. You have the halving in 2020. You have a couple years of an outrageously good Market that might Peak around 2023

Grand scheme, to me it doesn't matter. I mean let's rewind this. All of us were alive in 2011 or 2012 or 2013 or any of those years. All kinds of fear in 2014 and 2015 and if you would have just bought a few Bitcoin and done nothing you would have been one happy camper in December 2017. Hell even before that you would have been really happy. A lot of people in this modern skeptic ADHD generation have real problems with waiting and patience. This Market breaks them and the patient get to steal their money. If someone ever asks me about Bitcoin in real life my personal advice is to buy one right now. Put it on a hardware wallet. Then stop obsessing over it and just check the price once a month or thereabouts. Realize it may take a few years and keep doing what you're going to do. The emotional cycle will get going again. It is simply too profitable not to

I really want to see  real world adoption of this. There has got to be some way to get it into the majority of businesses or even the minority businesses. The way things are going they absolutely have to develop a way to use lightning on cell phones.

You know what's kind of cool. I pointed that out to them in one of their threads. Anyway it was pretty on subject and I just gave her a rationalization on why Bitcoin cash needs to die. It's just another Fork. They did not respect consensus and so on. Here's the interesting part. A lot of people agreed with me
The ridiculous in fighting and the poetic irony that refusing to follow consensus with Bitcoin led the Bitcoin cash and the same people who could not follow consensus with Bitcoin can't follow consensus with each other either 
Part of me wonders if Craig and Rodger both are unloading what they have left of BTC. I think Craig had quite a bit and if so you have to wonder if they are responsible for a lot of this price drop. I wonder if they are planning an exit from the scene

Of course. But it's one of the few capitulation events we have. No buyers have stepped up since bch caused the drop. Lower high. Lower high etc. If we dont get a drop to 2k and quick rebound the second style of capitulation is much worse with a  sideways grind for years.

I've been in crypto before bch was made. It was a cash grab. Ver was excluded and turned away from btc development. Bigger blocks and some of the other schenanigns played into bitmains hands with mining and asic boost. Blockstream wanted nothing to do with them. Big blocks started to get traction with bitcoin xt. Ver and wu took that and created their own. They invested obscene amounts of money in it. Its basically the biggest flop crypto has ever seen.

The irony is gold is more volatile than the US dollar. 
What you said however is a major problem with crypto since it is still in price discovery mode. If you're going to use it to transact as cash you need value stability. I think that's going to happen with Bitcoin but it might be 4 to 8 years out. You can look at the inflation schedule and halvings. Value also really needs to be at or above 100k when you look at lightning and widespread use

@_date: 2018-11-20 19:24:48
That's the conclusion I came to 
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:35:34
keep researching. price to mine falls if there is too much hashpower. it's naturally balancing. trouble would be undercutting the 2013 high of 1000 dollars and closing a weekly candle there. very unlikely everyone is giving up right when development is at its best. capitulation is designed to break people like roger ver who lives like a king on his stack. bring the value down, break bcash. wash out over leveraged players and begin the cycle anew. my personal best guess on a bottom is mid 2s but it's possible a retest of 3200 holds and we rally off it. you just have to judge reaction when we get there again. the biggest thing i see preventing another bull market is honestly bcash. it needs to find a final solution and be ended. if it isn't roger and his minions will keep trying to compromise trust in bitcoin and do all they can to prevent things from moving forward in order to try and prop up the value of his cash grab coin.

The bottom line is Bitcoin cash needs to die. It needs to go the same way as all of the other previous Forks. 
If we do have a final capitulation event and the price drops it's going to hurt bcash a lot more than Bitcoin. The entire Bitcoin cash project is being held up by a few wealthy individuals who went for a cash grab and had it explode in their face.
The part I personally hate the most is they keep trying to compromise Trust

Until you realize psychology. At 20,000 people wanted to buy it because they had dreams of it going higher. At 3500 hardly anyone wants to buy it because they see the pattern of it going lower. 
A lot of people make decisions based on traditions and patterns. The same people who don't want to touch Bitcoin right now at 3500 or potentially lower will be the same ones coming back about ten thousand and definitely above 20

There are all kinds of buyers on the sidelines. The problem is psychology. Normally fundamentals drive markets and TA is how you enter / exit.

The weekly needs to be making higher highs and higher lows. None of the above is happening.

Well if the network wasn't being spammed to push that narrative that wouldn't of even happened back in December.
It's a giant profit game to Roger. Creating bch let him have even more of the actual coins. The idea was to create a flippening and turn bch and what BTC is. Problem is not everyone went along with it when he tried to extort consensus. 
As you may have noticed. In only one year they are having yet again more problems with consensus on their altcoin. That's what happens when you follow Rebels with bad attitudes. It attracts more of the same. If you are a hostile dick, bch probably resonates with you because that's what the leadership promotes. If you're an intellectual BTC probably resonates with you because that's what the developers promote

I mean this is kind of the sad truth. The only bright side about it is with each Improvement and especially after you run the psychological cycle you start getting more positivity. I don't think we have really hit a bottom yet but we're not far away from it. 
That is unless we capitulate in the second way. A dead sideways Market that goes on for a few years. Then you would see people truly abandoning the space as time is what truly it's hard for most people to deal with

At first glance I can see how you would think that. Then of course let's bring up the fact that you can generate a new wallet address at the click of a button. Also keep in mind we have lightning in development and probably more solutions on the drawing board for hiding your funds. Currently all you have to do is generate a new wallet if you're dealing with somebody you aren't sure of or a business you've never met and so on
Now if you really wanted to be careful you can keep all of your funds on one wallet, like a hardware wallet. Send that to an exchange and then from there fund a different wallet. Someone would have to go a lot of trouble to track that. If you were even more paranoid you could run your coins through Monero and then back to bitcoin

It wasn't even that Sinister with Bitcoin you just had a few people like Roger that thought they could explode the world. I mean the guy is literally human trash. The whole idea was to hijack Bitcoin. Control the majority of the supply and have reoccurring boom and bust cycles that they could profit on. You know if you look at what he did in the past and you think man he got a really stiff sentence. No one should have went to prison for that. Well I agree but you have to wonder if the DA realized what a flaming piece of shit he actually was and that's why he got such a stiff sentence. Who knows, the only thing I do know is Bitcoin cash needs to be completely eliminated from existing and the best way for that to happen is for the market to collectively say this coin has no value

I noticed a lot of the whale talk in here today . consider how many Bitcoin are held by very large wallets. People are giving up and selling and the price keeps going down. Chances are it's going to go considerably lower. However let's examine something. If strong hands start hanging onto the majority of the coins on the market it makes the compression more violent on the up and the down. There is less active liquidity. This is also what is going to be a trigger for that violent move down. On the recovery as the price starts increasing you have people at every step looking to lighten up. They sell their coin and this adds liquidity to the market. Maximum pessimism should be reached before summer time this year
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:30:10

If you play that strategy you have to be committed to cost averaging read what I've seen happen quite a lot is someone will buy and tell themselves that and then eventually as the price starts to trickle down more and more capitulate.

I have wondered this for some time and constantly harass them over there about their scam altcoin project . Bashco summed the situation up absolutely perfect at the top of the replies.

There is a lot going on that hasn't got much coverage in the crypto news regarding traditional markets. Cruise on over to tradestation and on the front page you can see them talking about blockchain. Fidelity also has plans in the works and you're going to see both of them this year at some point. 
If the manipulated news cycle goes like it doesn't traditional markets what's going to happen is the ETF will get denied and mount gox distribution will happen. The price will drop to some lower amount and quickly rebound back a good percentage of it. Then the new cycle will improve and you will have all kinds of good things coming out bringing the price back to where we are now and beginning to stair step higher. That's my rough guess on how 2019 is going to play out and there's a lot behind it
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:50:04
Because it was a cash grab engineered by a few wealthy people who wanted to hijack the Bitcoin name, line their pockets, then dump all their coins on people they brought into it. 
Probably the single most toxic thing to happen to bitcoin since it was originally created
The only good thing about it is people have been wanting to make a Bitcoin XT or some new version and do what they did since at least 2012. Yes even back then it was thought of as a cash grab. When it finally fails it will show the market that you can't just market and promote garbage and recreate Bitcoin. If this turns out like I think it will it's actually going to increase trust in Bitcoin because Bitcoin cash is the single most well-financed hostile attempt against Bitcoin ever
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:30:52
You're 100% right but emotions Cloud vision and the majority of the public make decisions based on emotions and not logic. Look at our legal system. Laws always get passed after a tragic event.

Think this out big picture.  you take a lot of Supply off the market. The halving coming up next year. Well if you're not catching my drift it's going to take a lot less money to get some really big moves. Some of these big whales that have been accumulating cash shorting this Market the whole way down are going to have no problem getting a bull run started. When the price gets going again people are going to chase it. You see it happen every time we even get any kind of upward movement. 
I know myself and quite a few others in here probably have a stash on a hardware wallet. I'm honestly not interested in selling that until we are north of 40,000. If it takes a few years I really don't mind

Yea that and the ETF denial have our catalyst for a capitulation. Make sure you have some cash on the sidelines late February into March. It's probably going to get a little hairy. 
Don't panic and use it for a chance to improve your cost average if you're going long-term
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:56:08
no signs of either direction yet. no capitulation bottom and no uptrend.
see what happens on a retest of the 3150 lows. a strong immediate high volume rally would have me feeling more bullish. a wimper will have me waiting for something with a 2 in front of it
too many people have no interest in buying right now and we're consolidating for a move currently

Reading what you wrote the biggest risk factor is yourself. 
You have two choices. Capitulate and be done with it, or play the historical route if you're getting emotional. Put all of your Bitcoin on a ledger. Make sure you have a working copy of the seed. Store it somewhere and forget about Bitcoin for awhile. Historically your odds are really good doing this because anyone that would have done it at any time before 2017 would be feeling pretty good right now. 
If thinking about the price is getting to you my personal suggestion is to do the later before you have an emotional capitulation and do the former
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:33:47
&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple things. The timing and how roger and craig were Behaving is terrible for confidence but more importantly Roger and Craig hold a lot of BTC. It's likely they started to liquidate and that put a lot of coins on the market which drove the price down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp; been waiting to read a post from someone who did blockchain analysis and found out where all of the coins that were recently sold came from. You don&amp; have a drop of that magnitude without hundreds of thousands coming out of the closet&lt;/p&gt;

@_date: 2019-01-02 01:33:24
You probably should start scaling in now. Have a buy ladder down to 2k. We haven't had a real capitulation event yet but you never know how fast one is going to snap back and the chance of actually catching anything within 10% of a bottom is pretty damn low unless you have orders already on the books ready to execute.
Plan B would be to wait for that to happen and then catch the sideways movement after the capitulation and rebound
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:46:54

Well as long as you stay in the country you're going to get arrested and put in prison at some point. If you've actually been convicted you're going to have a warrant for life. If you haven't been convicted you have the statue of limitations and you can let that run out. Storing your money in Bitcoin is not a bad idea. You could use a ledger or an electrum wallet. Transfer your funds there then it's just hiding your seed words. If you know someone stable you can write them down. Put some plastic tape over the ink to seal it and stash them in a wall or something. If you don't you can engrave the words into a piece of aluminum or something. Wrap that in plastic and then bury it somewhere. If you can make multiple copies of the seed and hide them very well. If you're facing less than 5 years you probably want to just turn yourself in at some point. It's either that or you're going to have to get a new identity and meet the right people on the dark web. If you do that you have to be even more careful because if you open a bank account under a fake name while you have a warrant out you can be in even more trouble. If you get a new identity you're going to have to figure out a way to stay away from getting fingerprinted and stay away from commercial Banks

The whole thing was designed as a cash grab. You can find posts on bitcointalk going back as early as 2011 when people were dreaming up ideas like this headed the idea at the time was if Bitcoin can be this successful Why not start a new chain and Market it really well. If you get it off the ground the original developers are going to have a ton of the coins and then they can sell them into all the people that they think are going to come to the space. All kinds of altcoins have done this. There is actually a very accurate meme video of bcash on YouTube

You have to understand, a good capitulation bottom is actually bullish. There is just a fucking ton of people on the sidelines waiting for a bottom to be in and this series of lower lows to be over. Having the price run down to $2,000 on heavy volume and snap back up would be great because then we could talk about getting an uptrend going. People will Panic sell the entire way down and that's what causes capitulation. It's going to be a forced event from people who absolutely have to sell. Roger ver is a primary target with this. Him and others like him need to be broken
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:15:37

There are some very bright people on both sides of the coin. More times than not the people who are against Bitcoin have done very little to research it. A couple months ago I had a chance to chat with a local bank CEO that runs a West Coast Branch chain. He thinks there is bright future in cryptocurrency but wasn't sure what that future would be or what it would look like 10 years from now. 
In fact I have talked to a couple of people in positions of power and the thing is they know less than a lot of us when it comes to blockchain and especially Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 21:49:59
Doubtful. Too many people expect that. Those people havent been buying but will in the future once disbelief sets in and the YouTube marketing Network gets in full swing. The question everyone should be asking when that $3,000 Mark comes up is what would cause it? I'm drawing blanks. Everything that's on the horizon is bullish short of a Black Swan event like a major exchange blowing up.
The low price fantasy is really based in nothing more than people wanting to buy at a lower price. That's been going on all year and every time the price goes down they keep saying it should be lower. Believe me if we made it to 3000 they would be saying 1500 and so on
The fud marketing will let up once the institutions and major holders have filled up their bags to the point they feel comfortable and taken most of the available Supply off the market. The 2020 halving will play a big part in the run which seems most likely on pace for 2021

1. You said it was a very ignorant prediction to say they would never make a mistake again. I never said that. I said nothing close to that. Again you don't comprehend what I did say apparently.
2. After looking at your post history I can't tell if you're just a right-wing sock puppet account or what the deal is but you chose to come into Bitcoin after not posting in a month to argue with someone about a statement they make regarding the Winklevoss not allowing random people to put hands on their money which is what I did say. Back when the Winklevoss Twins were accumulating Bitcoin they were working with Charlie.  Multiple books have been written about the details. Currently they are running the Gemini exchange and as you may notice they have not had any scammers touch anything they own in quite some time and they are much bigger targets today. Again what I did say is that they have become wise to being scammed and allowing random people to have access to their funds
So seriously quit being a little glass half empty arguing poster and try to understand the context of what some of us are saying in here

They had to have the physical device and they had to go to an enormous amount of trouble.

study mining if you want to understand how there is a 21m hard limit

1. don't expect to really understand bitcoin for 6 months to a year if you study a couple hours a day
2. realize there are a LOT of scams. this is the nature of a junior market, scams were prevalent in the 90s when the internet became known as well

Quick technical question what's the difference between this and the wallets trezor and Ledger use native. I can't really find a lot of details on what they are using. It seems like Ledger is referred to electrum but when you install The Ledger desktop app it just gives you the choice for Bitcoin from what I remember

That coin has no volume. It's also going to run into the same problem Bitcoin did in the early days. If more people actually do start to catch on the difficulty is going to go up. With no ability to join a pool people are going to give up on the mining. That's going to create a limit on the number of people who can use it. 
. It's not the worst alt I've ever seen. It has a nice low supply limit but it's going to be growth limited with the mining restrictions.  Even now it's pretty illiquid. 10k usd daily volume ? It's more of a buy and bet project from what I can tell. With the low Supply if it ever catches on The Price is going to squeeze.  It's just currently the only place to get out of it is on two name exchanges

I just quickly checked your post history. If you're curious about this stuff and you wonder about manipulation and the doj along with the question you just asked. Believe me there's some pretty good answers and I will give you a quick outline. Number one there are a lot of scummy people involved in crypto. If you look around and you see things that make you scratch your head and think this isn't right. Well yes. There really is no denying that
Now on to your questions. Bch was a fork of Bitcoin last year. It was supported by a very small select audience that eventually Drew in a group of people. The thing that turn me off about it from the get-go was the way it is marketed. It's like used car salesman mentality. Lots of marketing. But if you actually take the time and study the blockchain and study the development of both you come away realizing that what you had were a group of people that did not respect consensus. Were not interested in developing Bitcoin. They wanted to promote their own product and capitalize on it
As far as the Department of Justice there are a couple of things going on and one of them are with ico's. A lot of these are pump and dumps. The second thing is with tether. Now I'm not sure about the articles or the evidence they are looking at because the way it is written they are saying that tether magically supported the market at Key moments. Well that's what Traders do with tether. They buy the dip and upward trending Market. The real question is are there enough dollars to cover all of the tether. We are going to find out the answer to that within the next few months because circle is basically taking over.
Bitcoin looks a little bit scary when you first notice it. There are a lot of people that you kind of get weird feelings about. The best thing you can do since you genuinely seem curious is research. Spend time learning how Bitcoin works. Learning how lightning Network operates. Study. Really try and avoid forming opinions based on marketing material

Just curious but why wasn't this deal done for cash again? I mean if I sell Bitcoin locally there are two forms of payment I can take and they are cash and gold. The later you need a little experience to identify and really only want to take Sovereign coins that can be weighed measured and identified
Your story is seriously my least favorite part about crypto. For whatever reason this entire industry attracts so many giant pieces of shit. 
You seriously just want to beat these scammers severely and the really crazy part is they just don't see a problem with it. Maybe when someone kidnaps their children and sends them back to them in a box they will figure it out

So I have a question here. If you look at all the available evidence there is about 99% of it pointing to the gold market being legitimate.

Hard to say but it's absolutely possible. I mean you just know there have to be syndicates of large players. There's not even a law against it so why wouldn't there be? 
Ultimately that's basically how I read it though. It's a shake out. Get the scared money who see Bitcoin as nothing more than an item to Pawn off at a higher price to panic. Big picture if a select group of people can control a lot of the supply they can put the price of it wherever they want and the crazy part is the idiot gamblers will chase it the whole way up. Remember how many people didn't want to touch Bitcoin at 3000 but once we broke 10000 they started noticing again . what happens when we go through 20,000 and all-time Highs are on the news everyday. People will chase

Or maybe the one percenters in the United States? If all that money flows into gold it's going to be at 5000 before you know it.

How strong was the password? Rainbow tables make hacking extremely easy if you're using less than around 14 characters randomized. To be safe a password you absolutely don't want to get hacked should be at least 18 characters all randomized
I have had some of my websites get hacked this way and they had reasonably strong passwords. Now all of them have 24 character plus random passwords and they have never been hacked. 
I agree with the others on what happened to you and it's very likely there are people working day and night to try and hack blockchain wallets because of what they are
Had you downloaded a real Bitcoin wallet this would not have happened. With 2.4 BTC you really should have been using a hardware wallet that's a sizable sum of money. Blockchain. Info wallets were designed to have less than $100 on your phone and have honestly been outdone by a lot of the competition. even coinbase has a 12 word wallet now

Why? You don't have the risk of owning actual Bitcoin. Everything is insured. Trade fees are less. Tax advantage is way better. The only negative is weekend exposure. You either have to close out or live with camping over a weekend. This is not a big deal for a long-term position
Currently the size is the biggest issue. /btc is a larger contract than most people want or have the ability to trade. The singles bakkt is launching are better . In other countries that may not make as much sense but in the United States the tax situation with Bitcoin is a major obstacle when you're dealing with actual product
Futures are also far FAR better for going short. You have no carry fee like you would with the hourly funding rate at a Bitcoin exchange

What country are you in? If it's the United States I would probably suggest you just open a coinbase account and make your purchase on coinbase Pro.

This is not the app. This is the wallet.

The price was ridiculous in the beginning and they quickly went to the Unlimited Model which helped really get the mass adoption going. I mean I get all the faults you guys are pointing out with AOL but you can't get past the fact they are what started mass adoption
They simply made the internet easy for someone who barely understood how a computer worked

Banks taking too much risk. Too much leverage and shit credit quality was behind that. 
Which has nothing to do with the overabundance of people looking to scam and take advantage of everyone they meet in crypto. I mean you have to notice this even on Facebook if you say something crypto related you get like 20 friend requests from scammers. Shining a light on the problem is just one way we can attempt to fix it because it is a serious issue. The dirt balls really do need to be chased away from crypto if we want to have some kind of mainstream use case and Global acceptance on a broad scale

The majority of people I run into who are into Bitcoin don't really want to transact in. they just want to collect more.

I have read this article for years. It's remotely possible you see something like that towards the end of a blow-off phase but for the most part institutional investors that want to get in are smart enough to just wait for the gamblers to panic like they just did and then buy.

They do. Roger wanted to take over Bitcoin back in 2016. Actually earlier than that now that I think of it. In fact if you go read some of the old bitcointalk posts from like 2012 people are posting about forking Bitcoin to try and recreate the whole thing all over again and cash-in. Well Roger did that. He has his narrative. 
Oddly enough he's stepping down as the CEO of his own company and putting another puppet in place. I'm not sure if this is because he wants to relax and do something else or if he smells the implosion and doesn't want to be the front man
You have to understand there are a lot of people in crypto who really want it to be nothing more than a pump and dump. They get their hands on whatever coin. Wash trade it up. Sucker in some investors and then unload when it becomes popular
Knowing this, it should help a person become a little bit more confident in Bitcoin. When the worst actors in the world benefit from the price going higher it makes you realize sell-offs are temporary.
If prices are going up people chase. If prices are going down a lot of people don't want to play

Yeah, that's actually completely true because I came across Bitcoin in either 2010 or 2011. It was one of Gavin's faucets. 5 free Bitcoin all you had to do was download the wallet and they would be sent to you. I thought it was some kind of trojan horse virus

I've seen articles like this myself but nothing with very much in the way of facts to back it up. Usually have people moved to cash it means they think there is going to be a short-term problem. The key word is short-term. If you draw a chart of the best fiat currency out there which is the US dollar against gold. Well it's not exactly pretty. In the year 1919$10 of gold was about half an ounce. Today half an ounce of gold is roughly $750. I don't even know what percentage the US dollar has lost its value vs gold but looking at those numbers that has to be damn near 99%. Maybe 98%?
And that's the best of the world Fiat

I think it's the execution where a lot of people fail I mean you can look at guys like Eric krown who use technical analysis and have made millions and verify things. The thing about him is he always sticks to his rules and keeps playing his hands. If you find things that happened in Bitcoin with odds greater than 51% all you have to do is make sure you stick to your rules. Many many people get themselves in trouble when they might have some degree of success and then they start thinking they are smarter and this time it's going to work out and they start letting emotions dictate their decisions. The past few months are a great example as proof that Twitter is just absolutely having a fit. Big picture what we have had is a range-bound consolidation. Quants that actually measure order flow are just trading against places they know people are going to be. Today is just yet another example. People thought we were going to close the weekly over the 10 and things were going to go up from here. What do the quants do they know where everyone's stop-losses are so they just push over the Domino's.

They definitely do because they aren't painting themselves in a corner.
The rest of the world is a really big driving force in this. Rates are already trending below zero on a lot of the European bonds. The FED has to continue cutting just to keep the US dollar in check against its major pairs. If this isn't done and the dollar continues to strengthen exports get hammered. 
This house of cards is going to continue for a lot longer than many people expect. The average person I talk to wants to to sell their house and wants to sell their stocks. It's exactly the opposite from what they should be doing. It's extremely clear where this is going and its asset appreciation time. They are going to continue with the fake inflation statistics and you're going to see the price of a home and the price of college and the price of a horse and the price of gold continue higher at a hell of a lot faster clip than 2% a year

You can't let it get you so salty. The psychology in here changes depending on where we are in the cycle. Early bull market is always the weirdest. You get the anarcho-capitalist libertarian type that think the world is going to burn and a Bitcoin will rescue us all. Usually the best in discussions happen deep in Bear markets. People were cool as hell back in December.  there was a lot of focus on development and where we were going. The other fun one is at Market tops like December 2017. There was so much hand-holding and dreams of grandeur. Everyone was so polite and supportive.
Where we are now is my least favorite time when it comes to social media and crypto. Early bull Market is low interest and you just get some questionable personality types

If you feel like this you're in too deep. Larger accounts know there are good deal of people like this and they will break you
The psychology you want to adopt is to think if it hits 7,500 I'm going to grab more, if it hits 6800 I will get a little more and so on

Low and negative rates push asset appreciation. If you own the land and you own the gold it doesn't matter. Negative rates benefit the wealthy and punish the working in just that way

It's because the overwhelming majority of them contribute nothing and really don't do anything. They are just a cash grab and often referred to on the inside as Bitcoin funnels. These coins are created to scam people out of their money so the people who have or created them can cash out into more BTC
There are a handful and by that I mean fewer than 10 that actually are trying to create a legitimate product. There are over a thousand altcoins so you can kind of do the math

I don't think you're going to stop news manipulation. I think it takes people all different periods of time before they finally come to realize a lot of the crypto news is downright fabricated. Some of it might be an opinion piece. I mean one example that comes to mind is the Nike crypto kicks. It was supposed to be a patented thing Nike was working on. Price popped on the announcement. I'm reasonably sure the whole thing was fabricated even with fake documents for the story. This happens fairly often and coindesk and all the other news sites pick it up and spam it all over Google
I'm reasonably sure the whales want to drive the price higher but they are going to shake people out first. When we hit 14,000 the last time there was so little Bitcoin for sale. The order books were stupid thin on the sell side. If they do bring the price down to seven or eight thousand after this consolidation the idea will be to make people capitulate. Have some money on the sidelines and wait for the deal if they do this. It will be like knocking over Domino's after the couple months of negative psychology we have been brewing

Not at all. This is just the nature of Bitcoin.
The one that bothered me the most was last year when we dropped from 6000 to 3000. That one was a little bit annoying. This one, at least so far May potentially just be a test of either the gap which we filled or the 21-month moving average. Lot of people are scared right now with Trump potentially being impeached. Global economy looking uncertain. I mean there's a lot of fear. 
The true worst case scenario is 14000 is the lower high off of 19000 and we are going to take out the 3100 low. I think that's ridiculously unlikely which is why I have buys setup at key levels. To me it's all about stacking sats

Just meet in a public place where you guys can sit and have a drink. The other person hands over the cash when you push the send button and you wait 10 minutes for the first confirmation. 
Pretty much anyone that says they want to buy Bitcoin who is not willing to do this probably is up to something nefarious. 
It's just one of the cons of having a truly decentralized permissionless system. You attract a lot of criminals who look to exploit regular people. You have to be on guard. 
Personally whenever I sell a high-value item. That could be a car that could be quite a few things. There are only three forms of payment I take. Cash. Sovereign gold or a wire transfer. Well. At least that's how I've been most of my life I would take Bitcoin now the problem with it is so few people use it for transactions. In the past two years of peer-to-peer deals I've met one guy who has a Bitcoin wallet and he didn't want to spend it and gave me cash instead

Not great. Not many new people coming around. Not many who are around are wanting to use it. 
The flip side is at 14000 hardly any Bitcoin was for sale. Like the order books were stupid thin. Now we are working on a 50% correction which is pretty much a mini bear market all by itself and all of a sudden people are extremely negative dumping everything they have

Bitcoin historically has never taken out the old all-time high before they halving. It's pretty likely we entered the last reaccumulation phase and we'll start trending up slowly into the halving
After that, the supply will be constricted and we should get a pretty good rally. The question is just how much of one

As far as Bitcoin goes what's going on is extremely easy to understand. Major players are trying to Corner the market. They can whip the price around all they want and it really doesn't matter. It's about getting your hands on as much as possible and if driving the price down makes the weak hands give up, so be it. If driving the price up makes people chase, so be it

That was actually one of the more concerning parts. You had this whole group of people who didn't want to miss the bull run that had a ton of money in tether that now went all-in.

Bitcoin will make the most sense to those who care about the history of money. Those who want to build an alternative to the inflationary fiat model. I mean I have a 1907 ten dollar gold coin here.

@_date: 2019-09-26 08:16:04
The question if you discuss with your dad is why bitcoin is different from any other market asset. Gold perhaps? Gold has a better trust metric. 5k years will do that but it's harder to move/use and while not easy to counterfeit. Bitcoin can't be counterfeited. Only copied, and the copies are easily identified as different. 
Free markets vote on the price of stocks. Bonds. Bitcoin is no different. The main issues bitcoin has imo are the large number of scammers in crypto. Exchanges and syndicates of people who manipulate price. It's still legal somehow and the large number of toxic gamblers who see it as nothing but a lottery ticket

@_date: 2019-09-26 02:13:06
I'm just going to take a stab that larger accounts randomly trading against where people are positioned would be a big big part of it. Of course the emotional instability of the average Trader would be another. I mean this recent dump is another great example. You had a bunch of leveraged Long's with liquidation prices above 8K. All they did is push over the Domino's
Lastly quite a lot of Traders actually don't even like Bitcoin. In fact I'm not sure why they are here. To them it's a gambling device that they Pawn off on someone else. I don't care about what Bitcoin stands for. They don't really care about much of anything besides taking money away from someone else and most of them have a questionable success rate at that

I don't honestly see how the public branches are going to stay in business. I mean what is it they actually do? If you want a mortgage or loan or credit card or any of that all the employee does is get on their computer and do the same thing you could.
Do you really need a human to take check deposits? I'm sure on some high-value transactions and things of that nature they will be necessary but in most major cities there's like 20 branches of the same bank. I don't see why that can't go down to one

The last part is the most important. what I was saying about a trend is easiest to understand like this. 
Since Bitcoin was born it has made higher highs each cycle. It has also made higher lows . if that were to change that would be a big deal and not in a good way
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:27:28
This will go on far longer than you think it will. Inflation was running 10% in the early 80s. The zero rate game will be the new norm. Nothing has changed in the past 5000 years. If you own the land and own the gold you're always wealthy. This new generation is pushing bitcoin. I hope they succeed. Who gets hurt the most in this zero rate economy is the working class. Assets will rise faster than wages. You guys think homes went up a lot since 2009? Wait till you see 2029. An average home is likely to be near 1m in a good city. We did a 2x on real estate since then. Another 2x or possibly is on the horizon. Anyone think wages will double lol
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:37:02
I think it's just how we are wired. If you're in the modern era which I would say is 2017 forward getting to one Bitcoin is kind of like an accomplishment. The thing is you only feel accomplished for a few weeks and then you want to keep building. 2 then 5 and so on and so forth

@_date: 2019-09-24 21:40:32
Unlikely to have back to back downtrends but possible if global macro keeps deteriorating. The reason I feel this is unlikely is because there is already a very high level of fear out there. Spx is basically flat for 2 years. That's not typically how declines start in traditional markets and the money and capital flows from their find there way over here. Unemployment matters as people have to buy. 
What keeps playing through my head is how few Bitcoin were for sale at 14000. It's just a giant game of psychology. The lower they drive the price the more likely it is they won't be able to buy back in at that price. That's the balancing act if you're a large whale.
In the 2018 bear market 6800 was a key level. Closing below that will be interpreted by many as extremely bearish. It's also an event that has never happened in the history of Bitcoin so we will see how it goes. New bull markets don't undercut the resistance of the last
For the truly faithful they see this as the only way they may ever get ahead in life. If you have 20000 worth of bitcoin or 50000 or whatever. You have to take the gamble on losing it all. Because, really if you do. It doesn't matter. Your life isn't going anywhere anyway. But if this works you actually have something
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:55:03
I think the chance of getting close to this is pretty good as so many people have their eyes set on the prize

Just curious but why wasn't this deal done for cash again? I mean if I sell Bitcoin locally there are two forms of payment I can take and they are cash and gold.

This is like what a great example the trading space is when it comes to being just a den of liars. For the past few weeks practically all of them have been saying oh we are worried that this is going to break down.

Then of course large wallets take notice and push over the Domino's blowing up all their stops or just liquidating them

It's the potential risk. If you look at the Bitcoin chart what we are starting to trace out is one gigantic triangle with the top in 2017 and now a lower high at 14k. There is risk that the model is broken and we no longer will have continuous bull markets that keep making higher highs. That's where the genuine fear is

Yep. That's exactly why stocks have been good in inflationary environments. 
To understand gold you have to understand its history. Central banks and the entire world economy sees value in it and knows there is value in it. It has been this way for thousands of years making it one of the most stable currencies actually the most stable currency of all time. The trust. The value of gold is likely to appreciate in inflation and you can look at a 100 year chart, actually it's even more important since the 1970s forward but the US dollar keeps losing purchasing power. We all know this. The thing is gold does not. 
Global banks are actually acquiring more gold right now than they have in quite some time to shore up their balance sheets. That tells me along with a lot of the other information out there they expect inflation and easy money over the next 10 years.

I think you guys are literally picking on the wrong asset. Gold has proven to be a good store of value and if you look at what an ounce of it cost a hundred years ago and what it's worth today, well it's appreciated. Fiat currency on the other hand. Most of them have blown up, the US dollar is something like 20 dollars 100 years is over 600 dollars today. This should read drop Fiat get Bitcoin

That's a very solid point. Gold does have an unknown Supply and even though we have an estimate on this planet we aren't really sure and every year we keep finding more. That's of course if we ignore the potential of asteroid mining in the future. 
With Bitcoin you know how much exists and that will never change. That's definitely a positive for price.

There is one part that is equally sad and true. Doesn't know how to read charts. Issue number one is support levels keep breaking . Issue Number 2 is people still haven't figured out how to fundamentally value the object. 
If you are going to harp on someone about something it would be applying appropriate risk management because there are thousands of broken technical patterns all over the chart. Doing that of course means you have to keep all your money on exchanges. 
Or maybe we could just be honest and admit the only thing going on right now is a little bit of bear euphoria as people race each other for the door. Then there will be the final sucker that sells right when the herd begins running back through the same door the other direction

 There is no such thing as diversify in crypto. Everything follows Bitcoin. Occasionally you will get an altcoin that outperforms but trying to figure out which one is going to do it compared to the ones that underperform is hard at best.

Definitely get away from that. With coinbase Pro you have to upload your money first before you can buy but you pay one hell of a lot less in fees and you pay the least if you use limit orders. The nice thing about limit orders is you can look at the chart, figure out the place you want to get in. Set that price and if it goes to that price your order is automatically executed. If you want to get in right this second you can use a market order but you pay more in fees. You could also use a limit order that is $0.01 less than the current price and generally within 5 minutes or so you will get a fill. 
The nice thing about doing this is you don't have to fill out any more paperwork or create another account you simply have to log into it with your existing coinbase credentials

There's actually a pretty easy way to test those coins. Tungsten is similar but it's not the same. All a person needs is a digital caliper and an accurate scale. Those coins from the American and Canadian and Australian mints are exact. They are down to the hundredth of a gram and their measurements are down to the hundredth of an inch. It's still a good idea to have one electronically tested as well but I have never yet come across a counterfeit coin that is made to the same measurements as the original at the same weight
As for space mining. The biggest asteroid belt is between Mars and Jupiter and there's probably a lot of gold there but it is so ridiculously expensive to even consider that and there is no technology on the horizon that is looking to make that cheaper. We still use explosion energy to go to space and that is finite crude oil. If we come up with some kind of a warp drive or Antigravity device you might have an argument but right now that's all theoretical and in the realm of Science Fiction. Even realistic plans like ships that use solar sales would take many many years to make a journey like that. I mean we haven't even done a man to Mission to Mars yet

Well, gold isn't exactly what I would call a high appreciating investment. It's an inflation hedge. A store of value. I mean if you look at the really big picture back in 1940 a house on a chunk of land was about $7,000. That was 200 ounces of gold. Today 200 ounces of gold is $260,000 which is arguably undervalued just a little bit as a similar house in a lot of locations is about $300,000. Regardless there's a pretty good Trend in there
Bitcoin has one hell of a lot more potential for appreciation. It also has substantially more risk. If anyone has ever listened to the bitfinex tapes or the countless scams we have seen over the years among other things you realize this is not a 100% bet. this is not a sure thing. We think the price is going to go higher because more people are going to begin to use it and because it's in the interest of the exchanges to have the price going up since the money they make on trade fees goes to the moon when that is happening. However this is a risk asset. We still aren't sure what's going to happen if traditional markets fall apart again. November was not a good sign. We had the world economy potentially faltering, traditional markets selling off and Bitcoin Falls in half.  Was that a coincidence? Maybe but if it happens again when traditional markets get in trouble you're going to have a bit of a correlation on an asset we have been thinking is non-correlated

Gold was used as a currency less than a hundred years ago. Until that law was passed in the mid-1930s Banning the public possession of gold you had $5 or $10 and $20 gold coins, even in the United States and this was also common elsewhere in the world
This was less than a hundred years ago. Another fun fact. $20 in the 1930s is worth a little over 600 today. One of those $20 gold coins is worth 1300 and just in raw metal it's in the 12s

If you think 5x is unlikely you haven't been around long. Unless we have just an incredible break with tradition it's going to do that and more. 
These institutions you hear about, grayscale the hedge funds all of them. This is an extremely easy asset to Corner because you know the supply. You know how many new ones are going to be created. All it really requires is buying up enough to make the float small enough that it doesn't take all that much Fiat to drive the price higher. You may also notice how quickly we got to 8,000. That goes to show you how few people want to sell at these prices. When we start getting over 20,000 you might see a few more Sellers and you're likely to see a lot more sellers if we get over a hundred thousand. This is the nature of the Bitcoin runs

If it's anything like the gold markets and I sure hope to God it is. It's going to be backed by physical Bitcoin
The only question is Leverage. One of the reasons the banks have been able to manipulate the price of gold down is because of the massive leverage on futures. They can push down the price and by physical because the Futures are actually backed by gold and you can take physical delivery if you have the money and carry one to expiration. 
That's what I hope we don't get. The second they start allowing someone to control 10x or a hundred times as many Bitcoin physically with just margin requirements the potential for extreme manipulation arises

I can tell you with 100% certainty just modern electrolysis methods would detect this before it ever left the building
Like a lot of news pieces this one was almost certainly fabricated for an agenda. Some of the Doomsday Preppers have been trying to scare people into buying physical gold so they want to paint the impression that there is less of it out there than the world actually says there is. These guys are so fucking retarded they don't even comprehend that you can literally buy a gold future and go to Chicago and pick it up at expiration
The price of gold is indeed manipulated but that's because the Futures have so much Leverage. You can control roughly $13,000 of gold for $340.

Then wall street went into risk off mode. The fork happened and some funds likely pulled out. What I'm looking at is who is left to sell. Bitmain imploding could cause that mid 1k number and if it does. Load up. My more likely thought is 2500 to 3200

I don't really see this as having much of an effect on gold. The only thing it has an effect on our the gold bugs that expect rapid appreciation. Gold is an inflation Hedge. It maintains purchasing power and if you look at a 100 year chart versus the devaluation of Fiat you can see its place. Bitcoin has one hell of a lot more potential for appreciation as many of us see it as drastically undervalued. 
If everything goes right for gold and the world economies start to print just an insane amount of money gold might make it to 2,000 to $2,500 per ounce. If everything goes right for Bitcoin it's going to be over a hundred thousand

Oh gosh no. The idea is to get rates as high as possible before GDP starts dipping under 1% and the chance of going negative becomes High. This is the time you want to raise rates. It's the end of 2019 and 2020 where you're going to start seeing the unknown events take place. This year is pretty obvious. Rates are going higher and markets are going to be downtrending in a lot of sectors.
The problem is how low we are in the interest rate cycle. Fed doesn't have a lot of ammo if we start getting into negative growth.

I'm with you on all of that but a digital currency is a brand new invention. One of the reasons Bitcoin is considered the gold metaphorically is because of its history and the developed Trust. Some of these new altcoin projects can say they have better this or better that but it doesn't matter because people trust Bitcoin.
I mean I own Bitcoin and I own gold but my thought process behind both of them are different. Potential depreciation on bitcoin is much greater but it's trust and security is much lower. You have 10 years of history and an asset that relies on the technology age continuing which looking forward seems kind of a tough call since we are going to run out of oil eventually. Regardless of what some people will try and tell you there is no replacement for it that can create the kind of energy levels we use on a daily basis. Every single source of energy we use is finite at the moment

The thing is, even if we look at the Gold run after the financial crisis. If you didn't sell the top you would have done a lot better just cost averaging into the S&amp;P 500. I also own a little bit of gold but for anyone else getting into it you have to have a clear head on what you're buying. Over longer time periods it functions as a store of value. It's not a quickly appreciating investment

We can look at historical trends and you can also look at technical support lines. The former I would put more weight into. The way fundamentals look there's going to be a positive media release cycle in the second half of 2019. What you should be looking for for the next 6 months is a support level to hold. Ideally we will wick down to a lower price and immediately shoot back up within a week or two. Then we hold a trading range where buyers step in if we start moving down. That gives you a floor and the final step of the bottoming process. Mid 2019 also puts us only a year out from halving. Currently we are 82% off the high. 2015 was 87% and 411 days if i remember right. We are quickly approaching day 365 of this cycle. Hard to see how we will get to a low with a 1 in front of it. 2500 to 3200 is the zone I keep eyeing

It happens, did you get a lazy dealer thanks oh this looks fine and you get a story exactly like that. 
The other thing is when you have a 10 ounce bar that doesn't really trade that often it might be a little more difficult to detect than something like an American Eagle or Canadian maple leaf. With those you know the weight down to the hundredth of the gram and you know the size and you know the conductivity. All of those variables are exact. If someone actually checks that it's impossible to counterfeit
 I see absolutely no correlation between gold and Bitcoin. They're different assets. Gold has been around for over 5,000 years and it's had a purpose for those 5,000 years. It will still have a purpose after we are both long dead.
Bitcoin has been around for 10 years. It's promising but a lot of promising projects have been created over the years. We will know more about its function over the next decades as much as any of us may like owning some Bitcoin it's far too early to call anything long term. More time simply has to pass

Well, someone getting into the gold market and not understanding how to do something like that would be similar to someone getting in the Bitcoin market and not understanding how their keys work. I don't know what an average person is but we both seem pretty average and we both have calipers and know how to use them. If you don't like gold that's your prerogative but you can't make up bulshit about how it's going to go extinct
Currently there is no profitable way to mine asteroids. If you want to speculate into the future again that would be on you but there is no evidence at the moment that shows that it will ever be profitable

Well my first thought is who uses those moving averages. The second is it's not that much different from what we have seen with short-term moving averages crossing the longer-term over the past couple weeks and it's a good sign. It means we are developing an uptrend. The risk target now is closes under mid 4900s

I want to know what a conservative actually is. The government we have now has doubled debt to GDP from the Obama numbers. The last time we had a budget surplus was during the Clinton years going into when Bush was elected and he made sure there was no more Surplus with his War. Then we had the financial crisis which caused a massive deficit but that's understandable because of the situation. That had been ticking down every year since until we elected Trump. Now we have this supposed economic boom fueled by stock BuyBacks and the debt-to-gdp ratio that's about 70% of the bottom of the financial crisis at a time we should be running a surplus. So please, if you guys like to vote right could you find the conservatives and bring them back?

I don't actually see how that's possible. The media is reporting it that way but if you put in a limit order at 6200 that will Market execute. It's also likely what was done. You can't intentionally sell something under Market on bitstamp but you can blow through the order books which is exactly what they did. The $6,200 limit put the floor on how far down it goes. That number is a key moving average and also the CME Gap.

It's possible but if it is it's not likely to happen in our lifetime. Bubbles absolutely will happen and even real appreciation.  gold has been around over 5,000 years as a trade of value or currency. That's Trust. One of the reasons Bitcoin is so valuable in the crypto-currency market is the same reason. It's rare and it also has more trust than any other coin in fact all the other coins put together cant rival the Trust of Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin has been out at least fifty years and preferably a hundred years if everything is still going well you're going to have a much stronger trust metric.
Things are still very young right now and that's why there is such a potential for profit. It's literally like mining for gold in the very early days

Says the one month old account. You'll find out if you stick around long enough. You might think looking at $90 going to 19,000 is easy on paper.
What's really going on is mountains of Fud. Huge emotional swings when you see thousands and thousands of dollars going up and down in your account. If someone would have bought a hundred Bitcoin in 2013 around $25 and watched it go to a thousand then back down to 160 the emotional destruction would be real. The emotional rollercoaster from the top in 2017 to the bottom of 2018 broke people. When you look back at Bitcoin being at $3,100 it seems cheap now. At the time a lot of people were convinced we were going to $2,000, possibly lower.  I remember looking at Litecoin for $20 and thinking is this thing literally going to ten bucks ? Five bucks? I bought some at 20 to 30 but I did not load up because there was so much fud about going to $5. Very few people had any interest and the bull market seemed like it was going to be a long ways off. I remember buying Bitcoin in the low $3,000 range and it was really hard to do.
There's a reason not a lot of people have made all that much money in Bitcoin and there's a reason there's only 700000 wallets with more than one BTC. Many of those wallets likely belonging to the same person making the real number considerably less
Bitcoin has a funny habit of rewarding the patient and punishing the emotional
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:17:21
That's probably a really good example. We have something like 2,000 shit coins that have no purpose. The market is and always has been Bitcoin. In this case it's a little easier to figure out. They just keep trying to copy and imitate. Bitcoin cash being the best example. You ever noticed that they are absolutely obsessed with trying to counterfeit Bitcoin in every possible way? Ever noticed that so many coins are Forks or heavily based on bitcoin ideas? Most of those are just scams to try to make money

no one truly knows why the price fell in half. some rumors point to bitcoin cash and that team unloading btc to fund their scam coin. others point to people seeing bitcoin as speculative and with the s&amp;p500 beginning a downturn the fund managers are hopping out to take the capitol loss. really....who knows?
this cycle appears to be playing out like 2014-2015 and if it does we are going to fall again to somewhere in the 2000-2500 range then rally back up to 3200-3500 within a couple weeks. this would be poetic if it actually happens. 
i would look at bitcoin similar to gold. it's hard money. hold on it to, go about your life. when it goes on a tear you can lighten up a bit. 
also train your kids on how bitcoin works and make sure plans are in place for when you check out. so many coins have been lost over the years i would imagine you will want your children to inherit them if you don't sell before hand

Oh for sure, which brings up the point about Bitcoin really. He has admitted multiple times that he has a hard time grasping new technology until it becomes absolutely obvious
Amazon is a good example. In the early days and even in the mid years nothing. Now the business is basically fully developed and still growing but like you point out he missed it for decades
There is a pretty good chance he won't be alive long enough to do the same thing with Bitcoin but you can kind of imagine how that would go. As Bitcoin develops over the years and becomes more and more and more useful I don't think it would be far-fetched to say he would change his mind once it becomes obvious

There is no hope unless we can get off this planet and harvest resources elsewhere in the solar system and beyond. Either  that or we develop some new technology that we don't have yet. There is not enough uranium to create the kind of energy we use on a daily basis for any lengthy period of time. If we dismantled all of the nuclear weapons I doubt it would get us a couple of years. Thorium is very promising and we probably have a few hundred years of that. Still even looking at solar panels creating the panel uses finite resources. It's a mathematical certainty there will be an end in less than a thousand years unless we get off this planet or develop new technologies. Things like oil are much much closer to the hip. Society is quickly approaching peak oil and we might actually be there. The downside at first shouldn't be all that bad as efficiency gains are going to make up for the reduction in Supply. 
In the long run though, if we don't get off this planet Society is going to revert back to a modernized version of ancient Rome. We will be able to create some power in an ongoing matter by Recycling and capturing Hydro especially. Compared to what we use today though it's going to be a sliver
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:47:26
That's what I'm thinking as well. I think the psychology is going to be the big hint for us. You remember 2017 when people were talking about Bitcoin in the parking lot and all of the graphics cards were sold out. If we get a situation like that again it's a good hint to lighten up. The other one would be something like Bitcoin going through the all time high and then a few months later getting to something like 35,000 and then hitting 70,000 a week later. It seems like historically psychology and really large blow off moves are the hints

@_date: 2018-12-09 07:17:52
that's a good point actually. we keep looking for events when it could be that simple. people who held years before simply sell because it's a lot compared to where they started. a downtrend begins then panic and all the traders pile on making the low overshoot just like the upside did. if this is true a bottom will likely hit between 1500 and 3000 not because of any line on the chart but because it will psychologically seem "cheap" to people as it rewinds to early 2017 pricing before the run up. hadn't considered this. it's a good point

glad to have you here. as you can tell this is still a young project and the kinks are being worked out. also glad to see you picked up on bch being nothing but a rip off marketing campaign. here's a link to a well written article from around the time bch launched. you can see people calling them out on their fraud from day 1. bch was just the final version of bitcoin xt and i think there was even one before that. people had been wanting to do this since 2011 with the motive being profit
your comment about learning from the past is the light at the end of the tunnel in all this. when bch fails it will show that even with deep pockets and strong marketing you can't rip off or recreate bitcoin. that is just a massive confidence boost. lastly feel free to ask any questions in here as you continue learning.

Into the s&amp;p500. Sure if you can get it on sale during a recession. Into other shitcoins, what's the point? Historically the best thing someone could have ever done is just buy Bitcoin. Sure there have been good alts. Eth. Ltc and the like but for each one of those 10 more went to nearly zero. The odds are terrible
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:51:53
It's just not the best coin for that. It's very easy to track. If you're going to be doing illegal activity Monero is a better choice. Even if you were able to buy it anonymously somewhere the blockchain still will track back to where you purchased it and they will still be able to find out where you spent it if you wind up under investigation
The real draw with Bitcoin is the development with lightning and having a hard money transaction system with lower fees than credit cards. The most important thing really is being able to easily get your hands on bitcoin also with little to no fees. Ideally you would be able to push a button on your bank and send something across lightning. Maybe as this develops we will eventually get to that point.

i was just thinking that. the same pattern recognition part of the brain that has people scared right now will kick into high gear when we go past 20k. bitcoin is going on a run again. look at the past, it always goes higher. with the number of people now following the wave should be huge. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:53:08
20k is probably when the general public will get involved. They like to chase highs. Last cycle most people came around when we broke above 10k and really came around dec/jan in the euphoria stage . 
If this cycle plays on schedule the back half of 2021 should have people taking notice

This mentality is why the average person never makes money in markets. If you think back to December Bitcoin was on sale people were scared to buy. stocks were on sale. People were scared to buy. 
Recently all kinds of people became interested in stocks right at the top. Just wait. You're going to see more people coming to bitcoin the higher the price goes. In fact I would venture to say the average person would be more likely to buy a little bit coin after we break 20,000 and continue the trend higher than they would have been to buy at 3000. There's actually a word for it that escapes my mind but it's a psychological phenomenon. Lower prices lead to lower prices and higher prices lead to higher prices

I don't think any of us are really the problem with the Bitcoin price and if it was up to us it would be considerably higher. If you watch the action going on on Wall Street right now a lot of fund managers are going risk-off and rotating out of anything they consider speculative. I think there were quite a few hedge funds playing around in Bitcoin. People are probably looking for redemptions and getting their money back after seeing the 2018 performance. Capitol loss selling is another thing for tax advantages

Psychology has a habit of repeating but it's always a little bit different when it does. Dot com high was euphoria. 2007 high was built on home prices quickly appreciating and stupid easy loans. Both of them pushed valuations but the psychology was a little different which means it's not likely to be exactly the same as 2017 this time around but we should be seeing signs of something. This time is different talk. Probably more usable alts etc

you can't gauge sentiment here. the people left will be bullish at $5. the people filled with despair have already left. this skews what you read to be bullish even though real sentiment is anything but. there was a recent article on facebook about bitcoin via the economist. 99.5% of comments said ponzi, scam, fake money, backed by nothing, it's all over. that's where the general public really is

I was reading through a lot of the earlier comments on bitcointalk today. Back when Hal Finney was active. 
He spoke early in 2011 about Forks and these spin-off projects. It's like a forecast of Bitcoin cash before it happened. He said they were destructive for the community and cast a Shadow of Doubt over Bitcoin that could never be removed . if one of those projects were to be successful there would always be doubt. What happens the next time a good marketing team and some money comes around? Post  specifically 
There was also a lot of talk about General usefulness and getting people to spread the currency around. We need more cheerleaders. we need people who are setting up lightning nodes. Only a tiny fraction of the world's population has ever been exposed to bitcoin. You look at that massive growth that took place from 2011 to 2017. if we want that to continue people have to do their part

yes ! this quote from Hal may2011 plays in my mind everytime people argue for forks or recreating bitcoin.
from Hal:
" Any successful replacement of the Bitcoin block chain will forever undermine the credibility of any successor. How is an investor to know that it won't happen again?
Rebooting now may benefit a few thousand early adopters. What happens when hundreds of millions use Bitcoin 2? They'll be just as jealous and envious of you as you are of others. Given the precedent you want to set, how will you argue against yet another reboot? "

Same applies here. Most traders are net negative and historically the ones who made a lot bought some bitcoin. Waited. Then sold somewhere in a bull market. Cost averaging in now is a great strat. I mean 80+% off the ath? Yet now people are scared when they wanted to buy 19k

Who gives the remotest fuck. If all you do is focus on price none of this is going to matter. Every one of you needs to be out there doing their part to increase adoption. If you want the price to go higher the best way to make that happen is to get your business set up on a lightning node. Talk to your friends.
Go back and read a lot of the early comments on bitcointalk. There is all this optimism about getting more people involved. For the past few weeks especially this entire sub has been nothing but price conversation and pessimism. How exactly is that going to turn anything around?

it may not be but his point about the psychology of "cheap" and "expensive" rings true. some corrections in bitcoin past including this one have no real reason. people just sold because the price was high and they made money. people are waiting for what they feel is a better deal and probably will buy hard at that price right before the run began just like they did in 2015. in 2013 the price before the run began was 100, the absolute low was like 160 on a wick. people stepped in right in front of the pre run price. if that plays true this time the pre run price was 1k and people will step in before that. people seem likely to eyeball the 2500 level or if they can drive it to 1500-1800 which would be the sale of the year and probably short lived. hadn't considered this being pure psychology before in a simple cheap/expensive setting.

People have said that shit since day one. I mean I don't disagree that more usable products would be nice but more than anything it seems to be a gigantic emotional cycle that tests psychology. Time and time again people will buy high and sell low. The more intelligent people just take advantage of them over and over
Why would they stop now? Once Bitcoin is all over the news again and making newer highs on a weekly basis you're going to have a whole bunch of people come running. I mean it's just too profitable not to have another cycle

You need to mentally have a plan ready. For example if you bought one Bitcoin at $4,000. When we get to the old all time high at 20 immediately sell .2. Now your stress level has been reduced. There is no possible way you can lose money. 
How far you hold past this is your own choice but psychology plays a huge part. Typically prices are going to run further than you ever think possible. No one in 2012 predicted Bitcoin was going to $1,000 in 2013 and I have yet to see anyone from 2015 or 2016 predicting 20,000 in 2017
There is the potential Bitcoin goes six figures and there's also the potential it stops between the old High and a new number

Lot of the crypto community are emotional gamblers. Starts making more sense when you realize that. Bitcoin is a game of chasing highs and running for the door before the last guy does.
I would be happy to see the value stagnate a bit so the gamblers leave. This toxic 85% volatility is destroying adoption potential 
As it sits the masses aren't going to be back until we are over 20k and that could be awhile 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:21:57
isn't a comparison of markets, it's of the things behind it. emotional people and people in crypto historically are VERY emotional
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:45:42
It depends on how early you got in. 100 dollars when btc was under 20 each would have made you a pretty substantial sum if you had the balls to actually hold it
I think the same thing as in play today, if someone gets their hands on one Bitcoin and they actually have the hands to hold it six figures is possible. Could it take a decade? Yes could we Peak under that on this cycle? Yes could we Peak over it also yes
If you look historically at people who have made a lot of money in Bitcoin what you have is a very small percentage of very skilled Traders. Most people who try doing this get rekt. And then you have the people with courage who simply by Bitcoin and camp on it then when the value gets to a point where they say you know this is really going to change my life they sell some. The overwhelming majority of people who have made money in Bitcoin did this. Why don't you just follow their lead ? this goes for everyone

I was looking at the optimistic side of this. If prices stay low it will break bitmain. Their competitors already have more efficient miners out. And yes I'm talking about the S15. It's already outdone. If bitmain breaks and all of that bcash is liquidated bch will never recover paid the price will be down under $10 and it will become the next Bitcoin gold.  This is insanely healthy for the long term even if it does bring Bitcoin down to $2,000 or $1,500. Bch has been the most toxic and most destructive thing to hit crypto since 2009

I do too, it's obvious what their play is. they want to take people who normally invest Fiat into gold and turn them into Bitcoin.

It depends on what you're doing. I a hundred percent agree there needs to be a nearly free if not free way to acquire Bitcoin. Coinbase Pro is one but it requires you to use limit orders. For a merchant it's a lot cheaper to accept than Visa. It's also really good for higher dollar transactions. $10,000 on the debit card is one hell of a high fee. $10,000 in Bitcoin is a few cents to transact

This is literally the biggest internet myth. If you have gold Futures on you can take physical delivery if you let the contract expire. 
The myth began because you can leverage a gold contract with Fiat. A micro gold contract which is 10 oz of gold can be leveraged for only $330 of margin. That's $13,000 of gold for $330 margin. This has more of an effect on price than it does the actual gold in circulation. If you want to turn your paper gold in the physical all you have to do is let the contract expire
I simply do not understand these recent garbage can arguments against gold. The fight has always been against Fiat and it's constant devaluation. Gold on the other hand has proven to be a very stable currency and store value for the past three thousand years plus

Profitable because the masses chase highs. Once you get enough coins in strong hands. The halving happens. pretty easy to get a run going. Already happened twice on a large scale and even more on a smaller level
No one actually knows what Bitcoin will do in a recession. It's never been tested.

Google has never been a dollar a share and when they had an ipo they were already a market leader. 
Microsoft and Intel are the better examples. Why did people not buy those? Well the mentality in the early 90s was a lot of people would never have a computer in their home. It would always be kind of a nerdy thing and it would never catch on. Sound familiar?

Cool, have fun being a pessimist your whole life. See where that takes you. 
By the time an idea is obvious to everyone it's too late
I would honestly be extremely worried if people like you did not exist in large quantities in Bitcoin. Pretty much every good idea I can think of is filled with doubters in the early/mid years
It really doesn't matter if I lose every cent I haven't Bitcoin. What matters is taking the risk. A pessimist will never do it because they always see what is wrong. This is the main reason they never accomplish anything noteworthy in their lives
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:38:13
history says otherwise. we are 82% off the high, worst correction ever was 2015 @ 87% every other correction was less. maybe this is the magic one to be even worse still but the psychology is very similar to 2015. minor dip to the mid to high 2s possible but people waiting for $1000 are likely going to be waiting for eternity

I'm not sure that ETF is going to matter that much with what we have learned about TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and tradestation all experimenting with Bitcoin. It's looking like you will be able to buy Bitcoin through your broker and I don't know and no one except the Insiders know exactly how that will go or what it will be backed by. What we definitely don't want are leveraged futures that set the price of Bitcoin. We want the Futures to reflect Bitcoin. There is a gigantic difference there
Apparently these brokerages have a custody solution and are going to have physical Bitcoin then let people trade it. We should have more details over the course of this year

Those two things go together. This argument has been made all the way back to 2010. People made fun of gavin for running that faucit. Gave away 10k bitcoins at least. Thing is. There is no way to know how much value that created. One person says hey what is this. I want to be involved. The 250k LN nodes aren't what drives it. It's the 10 million people plus who see and get curious about said nodes. Bitcoin has almost no market presence in the first world. Hardly anyone actually knows what it is. They may have heard something like it is Magic internet money but they couldn't tell you the first thing about it . they don't have any and they don't understand it
There are a variety of ways to spread adoption. The price sinking through the floor is definitely not one of them. A good rally works. Breaking 20k works but so does an increase in Social presence
Why not work on it all?

 There was at least a fundamental reason for the last Casino explosion. This one is just emotional people and the YouTube hype cycle. If there is a fundamental reason to point at the decline it's definitely bcash.
Bitcoin cash keeps trying to challenge the stability of Bitcoin and they have been pretty successful in bringing the price of everything down. Doubt. Fud.

Isn't it crazy how psychology creates a chart. The first gold etf drove the value and the inflation scared of qe sent it to the moon. It's been building one hell of a base and before long when the world governments are forced to go ultra low interest rate and run more debt gold is going to shine again surpassing it's old highs. 
I expect Bitcoin to follow a similar psychological trend. If we get Fidelity and other mainstream institutions onboard and approve a consumer level ETF or some way to get everyone actively involved we are likely to repeat the same thing gold did in the early 2000s for the same reasons.

There is kind of a big picture problem here. We did 87% in 2015. We have basically tied that today and it might get worse. there is a gigantic fundamental problem with this. In 2015 you had Mount gox blow up. You had massive distrust in the system. People literally thought the world was ending.
This time, there is no reason whatsoever
It becomes very easy to draw a conclusion the space is nothing but gamblers. Chasing higher highs and continuous dumping into the Lows always thinking. Where is the asset valuation ?

it's not yet. 7nm is roughly 2x as efficient as 16nm,. best case cost of production on 16nm is about 3800 making 1900 the new minimum cost of production....however....with all the difficulty adjustments we will have every 2016 blocks the cost of production will keep going down, 1900, 1800, 1700 etc. this will break every miner on 16nm as they are currently unable to compete. only the newest gear can turn a profit now

Lol no. Society does not try to help each other. They try and break each other. 
Negative people usually are doing one of two things. 
1. They sold at a loss and hope it all burns so they feel good about what they did
2.they are just pessimists that hate the thought of anyone having something they dont or getting ahead
Most of us know this. It's still a little bit entertaining to see how they try and frame it as being helpful though

This whole gold thing some of you guys have been doing is absolutely ridiculous and shows that all it takes is a little clever marketing to get people going. 
Gold is gold
Bitcoin is Bitcoin
The fight has been against the Fiat Bankers, not against gold.

I'm just excited about how good it will be for the community when these get down around $20. When they straight trading more like what they are, which is basically Bitcoin gold or Bitcoin private or any of the other Forks. It's going to be a great day. Not even going to be that upset if Bitcoin gets a 2 in front of the price if it brings Bitcoin cash down
I harass the shit out of r/btc from time to time posting actual facts. You know what I have noticed just in the past few weeks. More and more of those guys are distancing themselves from the Bitcoin cash religion. comments like I believe more in BTC aren't getting down voted into oblivion. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:42:23
That is just the thing. If they dig in their claws and design a way to manipulate price like they can gold. The gold market is kind of sad because the price is set from Futures and Futures only have a very small margin so Banks can push the price around very easily. they don't actually have to buy all that gold. If they did the price of gold would likely be quite a lot higher and Bitcoin might be at a similar risk. Let's hope not and everything stays physically-backed and they don't have crazy leverage that sets price

Have you considered just going to coinbase Pro or Kraken? I don't really see how Gemini has an attractive service model compared to the other two. Haven't for some time. Platform caters to high net worth
If you need a good mobile platform binance is the way to go
Really at each argument better choices than Gemini exist. 
A couple years ago I spoke to someone at Gemini and they were just flaming asshole status. Have not gone back or even given it a second thought

It's exactly this. The bitstamp trade recently is proof of it. Only 5,000 Bitcoin were necessary for that. So much of what is out there is locked up in Cold Storage that it takes very little to move the price.
Big picture it should be pretty obvious to figure out what's going on knowing that. If you lock up the majority of the supply of anything and people want it you can push the price wherever you want and there is very little that can be done about it. If they keep walking the price up a few thousand dollars at a time eventually people get used to that. They start thinking that 15,000 or 20,000 is a great deal. Then they drive it up a little more and so on and so on. at the same time the people who bought in for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars slowly Supply them with that great deal and make 10 to 20 to 40 times their investment. In some cases even more 
Limiting the supply is the first step of creating the next run.

if 250k people did exactly that it would turn on a dime. let me put it another way
which is more likely to turn the market around. 1 person setting up a lightning node, being positive and talking to people OR 1 person whining on the internet trying to figure out where the bottom is getting angry

What you said doesn't make sense, if you want to take that as insulting that's up to you but you clearly lack of very basic understanding of Western economic theory and the way the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank influence share price with monetary policy
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:40:15
actually what is your theory on the mirror? i figured it was funds holding baskets because some, like xrp have been somewhat stable vs btc while the main coins move in lock step for the most part
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:51:57
It's not actually. You have transaction fees. Also when the coins have all been mined you could make the argument for switching to proof of stake or another type of hybrid algorithm. Bitcoin doesn't really look like it did in 2009 right now and it's not going to look like it does right now in 2040 or 2100

Yes you can! Stop listening to fear monger Alternative media!
Each Futures Contract that is created represents physical gold behind it. If enough people started taking physical delivery all it would do is compress the price higher

That doesn't happen in a healthy Market. Do you understand what the bond market is saying with that move or are you just focusing on the one everyone is aware of with the 2 and 10?
The 13 month selling off when the 10 and 30 were being bought was pretty telling and that trade has been going on for a few weeks
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:49:38
I don't really see any signs of this actually. What is more likely to happen is more quantitative easing. They are going to prevent a Collapse by inflating the monetary Supply again.
I'm sure we are going to get a pretty good correction and a mild recession but it's not going to be world ending

Sure. But scared or skeptical people never get ahead in life. You're probably going to have multiple failures over the years trying for a home run. I think the odds are pretty good with btc. You have the historical odds and looking forword you have a lot of infrastructure being developed

We are going to do the same thing if it happens again. If you start seeing prices between 50 and 100000 in the next few years. Even your Barber talking about Bitcoin. It's not that it doesn't have value at that point it's just that it has a habit of getting overvalued which makes Cashing Out not a bad thought. 
I kept hoping that the corrections would get more mild as we went on in time. Definitely a little bummed about this one. It's just as bad as 2014

in other news bcash, or babcash eyes the $99 level which is just a precursor to the $9.99 level

fake bitcoin, only $9.99
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:24:23
I mean just something to throw out there and think about
The overwhelming majority of people who have made money in Bitcoin simply bought some Bitcoin especially during a sell-off and just kicked back. They might learn about the community and they might learn more about Bitcoin but really they just have it hanging out on their hardware wallet
If you're an exceptional trader like krown that would be a different story but if you were that you wouldn't be asking this question

complacent ended about 10k. anxiety was in play until 6k. panic happened with that massive 6k to 3k move. i guess that leaves us with anger and either we will have a capitulation event or a slow sideways grind which cause even more depression than we already have. 
personally, anger and depression i think are very very closely linked. i've seen more bitchy posts in the past 3 weeks than i ever remember seeing. 2014 vets may chime in

What seems to be going on now quite honestly is this. Number one retail Traders are leaving. They still see Bitcoin as a speculative asset. They also are leaving the stock market in record amounts right now. That is what it is. Secondly you have the more specific issue with some of the big players. It's looking more and more likely like the end-game is to break Bitcoin cash. This is very good for the long-term health of the market. Even if we go to 2,000 or somehow 1500 Bitcoin can survive. Bitcoin cash cannot survive under 20. They have way too much capital outflow. If bitmain collapses and 1.1m bch are released to the wild it will be in the single digits.
