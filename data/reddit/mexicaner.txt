I still don't understand why the US don't treat it like a currency. It's not stocks...

Runaway inflation is bad. Japan is really trying to create inflation. Venezuela is not really a place to look for policy making. Japan is a first world country.

Japan went from a good economy to a very slow one, compared to their precious prime due to deflation.
Albeit, I agree the subject is not black and white.

Deflationary is simply not working. Look at Japan as an example

Well.. The Japanese economy suffers because of deflation.
Nobody can answer that question. Else we would be doing something differently, sadly.

And especially around the CIS community, which is very tightly knit. 
I'm so happy for some of the guys on FTM. Played so much pub vs Iceberg.

Since when is surface area a thing? I actually find Berlin quite flat with low density but it all depends on what you refer it too. I have lived in Hong Kong for a while. Smaller than many European capitals by size. By population however...

But what's the argument for taxes in crypto?
My country sees crypto as currency which is why there is no tax.

Could look into exchanges that share fees with you. E.g Kucoin and coss
