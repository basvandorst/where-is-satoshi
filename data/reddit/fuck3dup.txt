I understand, The only thing is that I want to deposit 500-1000 USD onto the poker site. So I really wouldnt feel safe leaving that much money in bitcoin on coinbase during the fork. Who knows what could happen. Something weird could happen where I lose a bunch of money... I also asked the poker site and they said they have no plans in supporting the new coin. So since I'm too afraid to leave that much money on coinbase during the split in order to get free coins, AND the poker site doesn't plan on supporting new coin yet... maybe I should just buy bitcoin now and just play poker with it. The worst thing that could happen is bitcoin crashes after the fork and I lose all my money.

quick question though... i just realized i could keep my bitcoin in my wallet and still get the free new coin. id just have to get it myself since coinbase wouldnt be doing it for me. you think its worth it to hold bitcoin in your wallet during the split to get the free? or you think i would still get the free new coin if my bitcoin was in cash in the poker site. like after i withdrawal from them and get my bitcoin back you think id still be intitled to the new coin as well?

what are the other ways
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:03:09
but if you buy bitcoin after the split, it no longer belongs to you right?

1) So if I buy bitcoin on coinbase right now I won’t automatically get the new coin after the splits? I would have to use a chain split service? By the way what is a change split service and where can I find one?
2) Also, do you think it’s a bad idea to purchase bitcoin and put on a poker site for cash right now? Or should I wait until after the split, or purchase it days before the split and leave it on coinbase for a few days after the split? Etc

so you mean if you have 1 bitcoin in your wallet. after the split, that one key will then be worth 1 bitcoin and 1 of the new coin totaling 2 different coins? then how do you get your new coin?

so technically, you could get your 1 bitcoin. keep in wallet. wait until split. get free new coin, then sell new coin and get free cash.

So just forget about the potention free sedwig2x coinbase would give you if you have bitcoin on their site during the fork? And just keep your bitcoin in your wallet and miss out on the free new coin they would give for free?

Well to play on a poker site I have to buy bit coin on coinbase, send to wallet, then send to poker site and they give me the USD to play with. Then if I want to cash out, they give me the equivilant for the cash I wont in bitcoin and send it to my wallet, then I send it from my wallet to coinbase and then sell my bitcoin. That's how the transaction works. But I am hesitant to buy bitcoin or bitcoin cash to do this right now because the split. Maybe I should just wait until after the fork to see what I should do and what coin prevails? That might take months after the fork to realize though. Or should I just buy now and transfer to poker site and play and forget about the fork? Or should I purchase now and leave on coinbase to get my free extra segwit2x at the fork and then send bitcoin to poker site...

if they give you the new coins for free arent they giving you free money?
