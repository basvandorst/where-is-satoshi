Bro, they straight robbed your ass  and told you a creative story about a hack they haven't even elaborated on the details and here you are putting more money into those theives pockets. It is like you are displaying some sort of Stockholm Syndrome.

I am less inclined to continue developing my bitgopy library after hearing Bitgo's involvement. The weird part about it is that I could have never changed the hard limits of 10k dollars transactions inside my Bitgo account when I was developing my library, but some how Bitfinex could.

Actually, I used to buy around 2k worth of bitcoins back in 2014, do you know why I stopped? Because of their horrible fucking support. It is true they only choose to reply to certain issues and take ages to reply, do you know which reply took 6 hours for them to return? My reply telling them to close my account that I was done with them. They do have a shitty support, at least that was my experience in 2014.

Both of your statements are 100% true. However, it is a fun and challenging language to learn in my personal opinion.

It was coded with Rust, and that language has changed a lot in the previous years.

You could just email them, they were pretty quick replying  to me when I emailed them about the unfinished bitgo python library i was working on last year. Http://
Or you could tweet their CTO he was even quicker on tweeter replying to me. As a matter of fact i do feel like finishing that library this month

You do realize he is 23? Kids that age do not have an idea what getting sued is by an angry mob for millions of dollars with the possibility of jail time.Unlike some of the other executives, that have plenty of collective experience navigating the trecious waters of the legal system, in which they were accused of fraud, stealing, and piracy makes a  kid like seem like a dumbass playing in a field he is not prepared to play in. In addition, the kid seems like he is truly clueless, in the legal sense, since representing a company that is definitely going to get sued by a 1 or more disgrunted customers who aren't going to take no haircut to their money are going to use this kid's replies to force him to squeal to avoid a heavy jail sentencing. Frankly, I only see this kid going to jail for longer time than any of the other executives time put together, he really got himself in the wrong mess.

I thought that bitfinex said bitgo was all good in the clear and that it wasnt their fault? Am I wrong?

I can't tell which hat you are wearing. Is it the threating hat or the sympathetic hat? Besides, I hope finds solace in your post my dear guy that speaks from the heart.

I don't know about bitcoin, I highly doubt it as these people are paid around 1500 pesos a week so they wouldn't know shit about bitcoin.

Unless Oxxo accepts Bitcoin , it won't change a thing if 7 eleven takes bitcoin. The real quick market type 7 eleven is Oxxo, those motherfuckers are the slowest fucking workers I have seen when they are located inside the neighborhood but they are UBIQUITOUS in Mexico.
You either need Soriana or Oxxo to accept Bitcoin and the whole country will follow.

How would you buy bitcoins without cash then? It beats the whole purpose for many of only being able to buy bitcoins with credit/debit card bank transfers(aka all electronically payments that can be traced back).
