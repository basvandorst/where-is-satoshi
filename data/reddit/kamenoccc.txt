Well yeah. I mixed things up, edited that sorry. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:45:44
LOL well I really hope what you're saying is true. I just googled the name mentioned in the fox article. 
Thanks for the clarification.

I remember a time when we thought good news would have a positive impact on the price.

At first I thought that coinbase would be better at this but NO. This one actually seems easier to use and doesn't require any account registration.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:34:00
I don't have a problem with them selling the product. Not at all. But the description is kind of wrong. Wrong to the point that (at least for me) it gets funny.
This miner has a sha256 asic, it's made to mine currencies identical to bitcoin. 
* It is not **creating** coins, it's mining them. 
* It can only mine bitcoin (and a handfull of other coins too maybe), not *your own Cryptocoins*.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:34:58
There's also the transaction fee. 
But eitherway, I posted this because I wanted to point out that bitcoin is supposed to be a better alternative to the banking system; not something based on it.

His name is Jon Fisher.
The fox article mentions it, google it and you get a wikipedia article on him

Moral of the story, in a mod's eyes, the title is more important than the contex and discussion.

I still don't trust any fox jurnalist.
She called Mark Karpeles *Bitcoin CEO*. 
The *interview* is just some irc Q and As.
The proof she received to ensure it was truly him was a picture of his cat!

Didn't Andreas talked about this yesterday? I think he said blockchain.info remained unafected.

This would have gotten downvoted to hell if it was poster in .
Seriously though, do you believe that the authorities will bother? In my humble opinion, they wont. Moolah is not the only bitcoin service that hasn't applied properly for regulation. If you ask me though, this would not be the most responsible thing to do if you are asking for money from investors.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:53:11
Did you have to hire new staff to interigate bitcoin into your services? 
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:08:55
What? I posted in the wrong subreddit again... :') 
It's weird to me how my post didn't get downvoted to hell. Anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:08:29
I've used your services several times and I have to say that it was a perfect experience. Of course I was happy to see your advertisement in a place like youtube, just like I'd be with any bitcoin related ad. 
There's no irony in this post. ^^honestly

PLUS you can still mine it (actualy you mine clones of litecoin and convert them to bitcoin afterwards) if you have a decent computer. People are more likely to spend something virtual for purchases like porn rather than the money they get paid with for example.

I received this mail earlier today. If you click the image in the mail it forwards to a misspelled "blockchain.info" which thankfully is blocked by chrome's phishing security. It's obvius this is an attempts to steal the personal data of blockchain users, you should avoid even trying to visit the website.

Xsolla, their payment processor didn't offer bitcoin as a payment option before their deal with twitch from what I know. It was lately announced by coinbase that Xsolla will be partnering with them for bitcoin payments. I don't know about amazon, but this also seems like a win.

Thanks for the feedback, I actually suggested reading the article because I noticed you were answering the question in the title. I'm afraid people might take the title too literally, thus the down votes. I'll agree that your point seems reasonable though. You would find similar assumptions in this article actually.  Cheers.

There's a thread about this every week or so. They even created a board for this in bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 08:51:43
We the people are the reason this happened. Not a single individual. 
The most convenient way to find this PDF is to lookup 'bitcoin pdf'. That's just two words, 'bitcoin' is everywhere is the bitcoin.org website so search engines assume that it's a good result for 'bitcoin pdf'.
Since it's probably one of the most clicked PDF's that were searched through google it's now receiving a high listing there. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:12:50
Welp that's pretty sad. It's one of the first results that comes up when someone searches for "What is bitcoin?". One of the most informative results too.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:07:38
On the plus side, the host made it through the entire interview without mentioning Alex's crazy theories even once. If you skip the *feargear* ad in the end it could be an informative video of decent quality.

With the cartels that haunt the medicine market, I think that such a marketplace could be very well received by people that actually need medicine. 
Τhe health and insurance industries are huge and there's hardly any competition. If you need medicine, there's no way to get it without a prescription. For every medicine that you need you'll need to visit a doctor and visit a local pharmacy. That's how it is in most of the modern world.
This whole procedure can add from 20% (and upwards to infinity%) to the price. Furthermore, it facilitates the existence of a toxic industry and makes it extremely easy for them to manipulate the market since there's hardly any competition. 
Of course, what's mentioned in the OP would be highly illegal since the law makes things easier only for the medical industry. But if such a marketplace is created, it could quite literally save lives and also a lot of money.

The "Works on every website" claim seems suspicious. Either they're taking HUGE risks and will have a similar end to  or it's just not "every website" which still would make their service to look like it's nothing new and not even competitive to others.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:33:31
I appreciate that you're honest. But just in case you missed it the step 2 in your website still says you can shop from any website.

Greek guy here. Most people in my country get mad about citizens in FYROM calling their country Macedonia; same name as a Greek continent. I'm not even an ethnicist nor I care that much about what they name their country like but I'd suggest you to change that. Otherwise I think your project is magnificent.
