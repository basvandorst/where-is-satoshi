Boy once it corrects and goes back down to $7500 or so, might as well get in now before the $10k boom
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:41:52
Yeah looking back it was 5k to 3k. I forgot we just got to the moon, not back in October

People can scoff at selling when btc is going to climb higher, but you did the responsible thing and have now succeeded in achieving the dream. Welcome to the moon, time to go for Mars

Because it's not. Simple as that. 
It can't be a bubble if there's large support for it. And there's large support 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:22:22
Absolutely, but think of the sheer number of devs and normal people who truly want bitcoin to take over the fiat market. 
Currently the market is small enough that a single whale could manipulate the price substantially, but in the end, bitcoin is unstoppable. We are still within the first wave of adoption (~1%). Imagine what happens when 10% of the western world is using bitcoin. 
The reason it's not a bubble is quite simple: there is just as much of a reason for btc to be a legitimate currency, potentially even more so than some fiats. The concept of bitcoin is an idea, not just a coin. It is an idea that people can and have gotten behind and will push forward until it becomes a true reality
When no evidence that bitcoin is a bubble is presented, there's no need to defend this point 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:34:47
Again, if your coin has a ceo then it's not decentralized 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:47:50
No, once we break through and stay above 10k, you can expect it to drop a bit from some people selling. 
Once it recorrects back above $10k, you can expect bitcoin to potentially hit $25k before the end of the next year (some people even say as high as $100k)

Coinbase released an expected timeline, they said they would credit accounts and allow for trading with both coins within 48 hours 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:02:49
Correction after huge jump from 9k-11k 
Expect it to level out for a bit, then drop more. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:49:26
Probably not, unless they recovered the original coins, there is no way they would give it to you now. They don't have billions to fork over to everyone who lost money 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:33:00
This train stops for no man, and no coin 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:02:55
Haha I think everyone has one set for $10k. That's a huge milestone 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:25:07
Hmmm.. should I pay for my third year of college, or buy a dozen bitcoin when it drops below $1800? 
Tough life choices 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:22:19
Thanks for the help. Much appreciated

Transition to GDAX once you're experienced a bit
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:04:27
Just bought at $3,450  I'm just hoping it goes back up eventually. What if the illuminati hacks it and they delete all the bitcoin? 
We could all die. But everyone remember. Just HODL
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:50:07
Nah. Just day trade

BreadWallet would be a good option if you're not getting s cold wallet

Buy when it's lower than it has been, sell when it's high or hodl forever.

I can share a doc with you on google docs that is a template for this exact thing. 
Just made one today for google sheets

CoinBase is the best to start with hands down

Being located in Southern Ohio, is there anything I can do? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:23:32
The good news is I was smart and didn't buy at $4200, currently buying the dip for my price average.

Easy, right after the fork, split your coins onto both and then sell. 
If you sell within a few hours, you'll make a decent amount. 
Plus, if you believe bitcoin to the moon, you getting in at 6k or at 4k won't make that much of a difference

Now, you get the split which will make up for the drop after the split. 
Plus you'll have double coins

Might i suggest looking at increasing the fee. You may be way under the average so you’re not a priority.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:33:34
As you did it through an ATM and I haven no experience there, I’m not sure. 
Look at the fee you paid and then take a look at the average fee required right now to get it through. 
I wish the best of luck to you, I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help. I’m sure someone else will be of more assistance
