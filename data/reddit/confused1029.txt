no idea what to do here. received the notice last night. had hundreds if not thousands of transactions on my coinbase account. about $30k worth of sells in 2014 with 12k in buys. however, adding up all of my buys and sells at coinbase and the other 3 services i used to buy bitcoin (coin.mx - defunct, trucoin - defunct, virwox), i'm way down...to the tune of ~$15k for 2014. Haven't even looked at 2013 or 2016 yet, but I'm 100% sure it's a similar story. I live in the world's shittiest apartment, almost nothing (sub $1k) in checking, no retirement, and a load of student loan &amp; credit card debt. I don't even know where to start. I have nothing to hide; I'd welcome the IRS into my apartment and give them a key. I obviously can't afford a lawyer or CPA. I'm in the process of tracking down my bank account statements for those 3 years because they would at least show the transactions of funds going out of my bank account and funds coming back in. It's a bit nerve wracking to get an email from Coinbase regarding an account that was closed 2 years ago stating "contact an attorney promptly". Agghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks - I'm locked out too. The only thing i have are hundreds of emails from coinbase saying "you purchased X" or "you sold X". I can make a running log of that. Then there are 4 other places where I bought bitcoin. The buys/sells are (somewhat) easy to track for me since they were all done using my debit card, and I have email receipts for almost everything as well. But I wouldn't even begin to know how to calculate capital gains/losses from this. All I can show is that I spent ~$40k on bitcoin and got back ~$20k each year. There are literally thousands of transactions over the 3 years, though. I can't afford a CPA unless they take a payment plan.
