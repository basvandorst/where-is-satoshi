There are many social networks. They all do relatively the same thing, just in slightly different ways. They all compete with each other directly while simultaneously enhancing each other's intrinsic values through social interaction. More people using Facebook doesn't necessarily hurt people using Instagram or its value.
Pretty much cryptocurrency in a nutshell.

1. Anything can be refuted.
2. The "real" Satoshi hasn't made a public statement in a very long time.
I'm really not sure why everyone is convinced that Satoshi is even a single person -- "he" could just as easily be a team of people, or a woman.

It actually might stand up. It's not really a parody because you're using a copywritten advertisement to advertise bitcoin.

No, but it is a competitor to Western Union. Not everything dealing with law is common sense. That's why we have patent trolls who make millions of dollars. I'm not saying anyone is going to get sued over something as little as this, but what I am saying is that if somehow this issue wound up in court, I'm sure it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to say that a judge would side with Western Union as Bitcoin is a direct competitor to their services.

This is why it's taking a long time for people to catch onto how amazing bitcoin is. These huge corporations don't want people to know how great it is, because it means loss revenue for them. But they still find out, slowly but surely, as you've recently just discovered.

Just spent $40 in bitcoin and just got all my Louis C.K. to add to my library. No more falling asleep to YouTube videos. Super great move, Louis.

I can see where you're coming from with that. Yea, sure. People are people. People are also douchebags sometimes. haha.

Bitcoin __is__ fun and interesting! @_date: 2015-07-31 03:09:40
Dissenting opinion, when it comes to Bitcoin, are things mainly stemming from that person's misunderstanding of Bitcoin itself. If you understand the technology then you know without any doubt that it's the future. Not bitcoin the currency--that's still uncertain. The blockchain, however, will run the future. I absolutely guarantee it. It's the most revolutionary thing to happen to the Internet since Online Pornography.
When people go against this ideal, then yea, we Bitcoiners can get pretty belligerent--but that's only because we just saw the equivalent of the Wright Brothers take flight and some people are like "Wow, that thing is so fucking gay, man. It's gonna be gone in just a few years. It's so impractical!"
Simply because they don't fully understand it. That's all. So on behalf of my bro's, I apologise for using such harsh words, but I won't apologise for anything else.

Seems they ran out of funding. I really fucking hate services like this that just shut down without explaining the reasons why.

Oh, nice. I just got $30 worth of BTC on the 6th and I checked today and it's worth $52. 
Today was a good day. I can't wait till it's worth $0.25.

You could always send the requests from a single source through multiple upstream VPNs or other connected resources. No reason why anyone with intelligence would execute a DoS from a single location.
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:13:24
What do you think this is, CSI:Miami? No one would logically be able to know the origin of the connection to be able to 'kill' it in the first place. Regardless, a DDoS can be executed any number of ways. You're not limited to raw connections and VPNs. The reasons why DoS and DDoS are terrible is because they're difficult to deal with and are very hard to stop.
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:02:37


There are two points to a DDoS.
1. Bring down a service or group of services using an overflow of requests.
2. Be subversive enough to continue the attack for long periods of time.
Anything that doesn't follow those can hardly be considered an attack.

Well, this didn't go as well as I'd have hoped; so let me try again...
    Using either experience (where I have none [aside from historical data]), or factual evidence provide your opinion as to whether or not the BTC market will rebound from this disastrous plummet in price.
