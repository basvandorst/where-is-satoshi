I hope not. I bought at $550 and really, really wanted to double &amp; dump. Hit $1000 when I wasn't looking and gone ever lower since then.

I wouldn't know, I didn't really get on board until the morning of the China crash. Good insight though thanks.

That's the story of every good stock ever, though. I was 22 years old and working full time when Apple hit rock bottom and Steve came back. I was sitting in the break room saying to a coworker, "Hmm, I wish I knew how to buy stocks, I'd definitely get some of that right now." Ameritrade &amp; Etrade were barely things then...
At least I bought one full Bitcoin at $560 :)

Try to forget you ever bought it - just don't lose track of where you're keeping it. Treat it like a long term lotto ticket. If it fails, it was trash anyway. If it comes back - surprise payday!

Shit I'd like to see it get over $500 again, I'm kinda thinking I want off this train but it'd all be a loss right now. :P

But at the time, there was no SIGN that it was going to stop short. BTC is so volatile, going from $1000 to $950 could have been an afternoon thing. Of course had I to do it again I would have sold. Now, I'll wait.
I actually bought a second last night :)

I want it back at 1000 again, wonder if that's in the cards now that half the world has obfuscated it.

Too bad about the current value. Pretty weak that the same donation (3.2 bits as I write this) would have been worth $3000 a month ago, now it's about $1200. I guess unlike the dollar, if they can manage not to to spend it for a year maybe it'll be worth double? 
We can all hope.

Bought 1 at $570 after the China crash, used it as a teaching opportunity telling my wife &amp; her family that it would come back to $1000 in a matter of weeks and I'd sell it. It did come back to $1000 but only for *like a minute and a half.* I missed it, so I waited as it teetered at $990 for days then tumbled, tumbled down. Bah.
Holding. Only question now that it's in the $400s is, do I buy another... I want to believe it'll get back to 4 digits again, but I have no reason to believe it hasn't settled in its comfort zone.

I beg to differ, in a disaster where people have no homes, actual spendable cash DOES matter *a lot.* They aren't collecting for tech cred, they need real things. And I'm not saying Bitcoin is a negative vs. positive in this scenario, it's just... interesting.

Actually the average rate is back to where it was after the Chinese banks stopped recognizing it. I know, because it's right back where I bought my coin a couple months ago. Please please rebound...

Good point.

Pfft, it'll be hacked by then and he'll have lost it all.

I bought two at $500. Then it tanked, and kept tanking. I waited and waited and waited until it finally creeped back up and sold it to break even. I didn't feel bad about it for a long time because it sat there.
I fucking hate so many of you right now.
