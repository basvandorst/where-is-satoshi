1) Why do you think the risk escrow agents would bear would match that of paypal?  Paypal is, after all, a very large centralized operation with an enormous fraud department.
And who draws up this contract you mention?  And are all buyers and sellers expected only to trade with people in their own country?  That seems a bit... centralized.
The sort of escrow agents you propose will, obviously, need to accept, hold, and forward bitcoin, in addition to fiat.  It's the other side of the exchange.  This is what I mean by "bitcoin escrow agent".
I like living in a centralized government, thank you.  It's even got fast, reliable centralized exchanges for its currency!
Orders on books are not a source of liquidity.  The paper you link to shows that the book can be manipulated to show false liquidity via early access to trade data-- an interesting piece of fraud, to be sure, but nothing in there contradicts the fact that *market* liquidity is provided by dealers, not bestowed from on high by a friction-erasing invisible hand.  HFT is full of shenanigans, to be sure.  But if you think there won't be shenanigans if you make the end-to-end retail market *slower,* and make one leg of it in bitcoin to boot, then you're out of your mind.

1) How high would that fee need to be, to make it worth an agent's trouble?
2) Sue them for what?
And in which jurisdiction?
How much would you expect I'd have to pay in up-front legal expenses for the suit?
Can you point me at some case history of suits won against bitcoin escrow agents?
And isn't all of this now relying rather heavily on centralized governments, if we're still discussing a decentralized bitcoin exchange?
"Dealers" is not vague, it has a well-understood meaning in finance.  It refers to people who buy and sell money (and notes) and profit from the spread.  And they're the source of market liquidity.  Volume is not liquidity.  People placing orders while Gox was lagging were doing so into a market with, by definition, a liquidity problem.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:26:35
What's the incentive for the escrow agents, who have to transact fiat and shoulder all of the legal burden that comes with it?
What happens when an escrow agent empties accounts before the smart contract calls in the markers?
Your or my own personal notion of "real time" isn't important, the definition that matters is the one used by the people who provide liquidity to the entire market-- the dealers.  And I think they'll want "real time" to be very, very real indeed.

Er, do you understand the difference between an escrow arrangement and a wire transfer?
You don't need escrow to transfer an asset, you need it to make sure your counterparty doesn't walk away with your asset without giving you anything in return.  The escrow agent naturally offers the same assurance to the counterparty, thus the escrow agent receives all assets to be exchanged.  That's what escrow *is.*  Have you been talking about something else this whole time?

"Interesting" to the buyer, of course.

If a government were to get involved with bitcoin, why on earth would it buy existing coins, when it's so profitable to start a mining operation instead?
Any country that decided to move its currency to BTC would definitely want to control a portion of the mining network just for fiscal security.
And if you're going to buy a little bit of mining gear, why not buy a lot?  Why not build your own fabs for your own ASICs?  And a government could simply requisition electricity on national security grounds, too, since most power plants are tightly controlled, if not owned outright, by governments.
In fact, a government that isn't in dire financial straits should easily be able to achieve 51% in just a year or two; and it would absolutely be in that government's best interests to do so, if it had switched any part of its financial system to bitcoin.
A government *buying* bitcoin?  That's thinking way, way too small.

Erm, I think there's a step missing in that nice clean workflow: the one where the merchant confirms the fact that you've actually transferred funds to them (and not e.g. to yourself via a lookalike page/app on your phone).

In this country (the US) there is a big difference between a customer disputing and reversing charges, vs. what happens when a card is stolen.
When my credit card is stolen, I do not need to dispute or reverse anything.  The credit card company just calls me up (their fraud detection is good enough that they will often call the customer before the customer even knows the card is missing) asks me what I bought last, refunds the rest, and pays for the thief's tacos, too, unless a certain fraud threshold has been reached over at the taco merchant.
You can easily tell which merchants are over that threshold here, because they will ask to see a photo ID every single time you use a credit card in the shop (amusingly, any shop that sells prepaid "burner" phones, even if it's nowhere near their core product category, will demand photo ID).

Correct, no-one ever has or ever will dishonestly acquire anyone else's bitcoins.
This mathematically enforced honesty is the reason you will never see a dishonest person attempting to acquire bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:36:27
The merchant actually gets the funds if you use a stolen credit card (this is why credit cards have high transaction fees).  Merchants train cash handlers to identify counterfeit notes, and often have several supplemental tools available on-hand to do so (UV, marker, etc).
And the merchant doesn't care how fast you leg it with those tacos, if the Merchant confirmed your payment before they even sent the order to the kitchen, let alone handed over the tacos.
But for that paper QR code taped to your counter?  Nothin'.  No payment confirmation assurance whatsoever.
The fact that it's possible (though difficult and risky) to rip merchants off *without* bitcoin doesn't mean they're going to just shrug and accept a system that makes it trivial to rip them off *with* bitcoin.

Trenchant, but the problem with this is that if the "single product" is food, and if we all follow your imaginary logic that says "the only alternative to central planning is completely unregulated markets", then sooner or later we end up with famine in a country that has a large population.  Or nuclear weapons.  Or both.
Perfect central planning is obviously impossible-- which is why no contemporary socialist democracy attempts to implement anything like it today.
Instead, they implement restrictions on private-sector capitalism.  And the economic results of these (actual, existing) systems are noticeably better than what came before.

The "it's just ones and zeroes" argument hasn't stood up so well in court, so I don't think that's really the issue.
The key thing to realize here is that the phrase "make BitCoin illegal" is not stating a concern about something that might actually happen in the world, but is rather what someone (I can't recall who) once brilliantly termed "a wish expressed as a worry."

I find it rather revealing that you do not value bitcoin in terms of "what goods and services can I get in exchange for it", but rather in terms of "How much fiat currency can I sell it for".
And you don't even mention the Humble Bundle sales model of "pay whatever you feel like paying."  This seems to work fairly well for Humble Inc., but it means a Humble Bundle has an effective resale value of zero, so there's no headroom at all for any sort of intermediary market to take root.

You can have force without any government at all, of course.  Any sibling who has ever been flattened by another sibling knows this.

I'm not sure the phrase "make bitcoin illegal" makes any sense to begin with, from a legislative standpoint.
The first problem is that there is no existing legal definition of "Bitcoin."  This is an example of a thing that seems blindingly obvious to non-lawyers, but becomes exceedingly difficult to pin down in legislation (see: "pornography").
I for one can't think of any simple language that would describe Bitcoin, but exclude, say, DevCoin.  If the intent of legislation were to ban all distributed cryptocurrencies completely, you'd still have to come up with something that not only allows MMORPG currencies, but also things that function as currencies but are rarely discussed as such: e.g. file-sharing reciprocity accounting.
Though it will surely disappoint the paranoid fantasists, the laws that will be brought to bear on bitcoin users in the US are quite unlikely to be of the "ban all bitcoins" variety, and very likely indeed to draw on the usual suspects:  racketeering, wire fraud, tax evasion, etc.

A cryptocurrency of course also has disadvantages relative to a fiat currency-- it's silly to simply say one is "better" than the other.
Have you tried borrowing crypto recently?  Have you tried appealing to your local monopoly on the legitimate use of force for aid in collecting debt or correcting fraud denominated solely in crypto?

Better yet, could you perhaps write down the distinction in some sort of formal manner so that I and the other people in my community know that the same distinction will apply to any of us, regardless of how exemplary our attendance-record might be in our local General Assembly?
And could you somehow make that distinction societally binding?  With magic, perhaps, instead of force?  Definitely without coercion, of course-- just autonomous groups acting to provide restorative justice?  But mandatory, I mean.  In the voluntary way.

If they'd only sent units to three different media companies, you'd be screeching about how they cherry-picked the "reviewers."
If they only had 30 of the blasted things, then what they were sending around were samples from a test batch, not the first units in a real production run.  And sending samples to reviewers, with "not final product" caveats, is absolutely standard practice in the industry.
What's not standard practice, however, is pretending your test batch was a shipping product, in subsequent press releases.
