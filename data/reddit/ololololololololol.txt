If you accept that the USD will at some point lose its place as the world’s reserve currency,
And you also accept that a decentralised, censorship-resistant and neutral currency will take its place,
Then you understand why all the FUD.

Price does affect utility. 
Couple of examples: if a mega-rich person wanted to store billions of value in Bitcoin, or oil producers/buyers wanted to transact in Bitcoin, at the moment they can't. Bitcoin is still too small for these uses, but if it was worth more then it would open up new use cases (i.e. utility increases).

Firstly, bitcoin is as 'real' as the dollar, euro, or indeed the real (Brazilian fiat currency).
Why will people use it? Many reasons, but ease of transacting would be my  
Example: tipping on Reddit using the tipbot, something that would be practically impossible to do with legacy banking systems. Bitcoin is programmable money, which makes things like the tipbot possible.
Much like the early days of the internet, we can't yet imagine what will be possible with cryptocurrency.

I have seen several Bitcoin commentators claim that Bitcoin will eventually be worth zero or be mind-bogglingly huge; a binary outcome, no middle ground.
Why do people believe this?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:04:59
Agreed, but the best way to understand bitcoin is to actually start using it. Reading up is necessary but will only get you so far.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:15:10
an easy way to do it is with localbitcoins.com. Find a local trader, buy a coin (or fraction of) and hey presto, welcome to bitcoin.
Once you've bought in, read up on cold storage so you don't have to rely on 3rd parties.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:49:14

The first mover advantage with cryptocurrency is pretty huge. Think of all the infrastructure required to support bitcoin as a viable medium of exchange and store of wealth for the masses. And contrast with the lack of support for altcoins.
Not to say altcoins don't have their place, but I see them forming a similar relationship with bitcoin as gold does with silver. With the added bonus that bitcoin can incorporate some of the better properties of altcoins.

The easiest way to start is to forget about wallets that you download, and instead use online services (localbitcoins.com is good for buying, and blockchain.info have a good online wallet service). Wallets can come later once you understand how it works. Use 2-factor authentication if you do go for this to make your coins more secure.
It's worth reading up on cold storage before you invest heavily.
I'd advise understanding bitcoin first before dabbling in litecoin or other altcoins.
Start small, take some time to research this thing and good luck.

Like everyone else, I don't know for sure.
However, the previous two bubbles were preceded by large spikes in wikipedia page views. 
There has been a huge spike in wikipedia page views this week. If the pattern holds then we're in for another bubble in a cpl of weeks.

This is the problem - an underlying assumption that actors will not intend to cause damage.
**A solution**: encourage all those who have a stake in bitcoin to mine with their own mining equipment. Consider it a bitcoin tax you pay to keep the network secure.
