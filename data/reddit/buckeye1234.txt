Late to the party? My basis is under 5K per btc. I FOMO’d? You bet your ass I did. All  my successful investments are based on not missing out on future gains, not sure why that’s a bad thing. Gluck 2 all

Article quotes a Gibson Dunn lawyer saying 6 mos is “often” how long it takes

I bought BTC starting early ‘19 after reading 100s of articles.
And I was HELLA bullish in Jan/Feb. 
That bullishness was based on my read of institutional sentiment around BTC. Don’t know anything about TA but trust my read of human behavior/sentiment, which has been incredibly useful to me in my life/career and relatively lucrative.
I am today WAY more bullish than back in Jan/Feb ‘19.
We just had the top finance guy in the fucking country compare BTC to gold.
The TA guys may tell me that based on RSI/MACD/triangles/Golden Crosses/pen-ants/EMAs (?)/bounces/dead cats and so on that I am full of shit.
But I am convinced to my core that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that in the long-term BTC only goes one way—up—and continues its majestic rise. 
And no amount of drawing on a graph will change that.

Someone give this man Gold, please.

That’s why interest rates are being lowered, I *think*, but WTF do I know

Buy the dip, pump, sell. My personal view is that big money is doing this, but taking it one step further—depressing the price while clients get in, then pumping
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:56:54
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:47:17
That’s a bit aggressive. The first hedge fund in equities started small too.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:18:22
Not for long, if this is a classic spoof...
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:39:34
Seems like a whale move of ~21K BTC to CBP is a contender—~10K sold at 8.4ish and probably rebought at 7.9ish. Remaining ~10K transferred  back out of CBP...
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:31:52
Got it, thank you!

A $20M hedge fund specializing in Turkish apples, for which there is a $20 million market globally, is not thereby a large hedge fund. ‘Big’ in money management is NOT measured relative to size of the sector in which the fund specializes.

Like today.

Can you provide vol stats?

He runs the biggest VC firm in the world. He is worth nearly $20B personally. His company—Softbank—owns among others Sprint and large chunks in dozens of unicorns, and has 100s of billions of $ at its disposal via the Softbank Vision Funds.
He is not a “dipshit”—he is a very big deal in Silicon Valley and widely regarded to have extraordinary investing acumen.
The fact that he bought 100s of millions of $ of Bitcoin is a good sign long-term.
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:52:34
I wonder if the SVF bought the $100M of BTC earlier in the month that triggered this rally.
Agree this is an EXCELLENT sign.
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:48:45
It’s a rounding error for a guy who sits on top of nearly $20B personally and 10 times that via his company.
That Masa Son—widely regarded to be one of the best investors—bought bitcoin is a GOOD sign long-term. 
IT WILL MAKE ALL OTHER HUGE HUGE INVESTORS PAY ATTENTION TO THIS STUFF. 
I’ve been waiting for someone like Softbank or Andreesen Horowitz to publicly take a bet. When that happens, and Fidelity starts selling crypto, we go to Mars! 
My own personal view is that it’s just a matter of time.
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:13:42
I asked as well never got an answer
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:40:15
Because this is the day a prominent old school VC firm publicly said it’d start funneling money to crypto

Here is a relevant link 
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:57:36
Got it and thanks.
Consider me not a dipshit—the news re Masa was the second biggest bull sign I’ve seen this month (Fidelity preparing to sell crypto to retail investors is the other).

Go on long hikes. Multiple times a week. At least 7-8 miles. No phones. Maybe a couple joints. It will help.

Fidelity’s survey echoed similar sentiment from institutional money
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:11:47
Was Madoff a terminal blow to equities????? Or what about rigging LIBOR—did that kill the debt markets? Should we abolish mortgages??? Or what about the FX rigging discovered recently—should we abolish FX markets? I guess that means FIAT should be abolished... wait...

In big money circles that’s not big

What I don’t understand is how people got wiped out. Did stop-loss functionality on the exchanges stop working?

Also similar to 8-8900?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:50:25
Thanks. Just weird that you see the price moves in the entire market... also I’d understood big buyers buy off the exchanges...

How is that? I’m in the money now by 30%. I have tiered stop-loss sales of 1/3 of my stack at 10, 15 and 20% drops, at which point I still remain 10% in the money. How can I get “wiped out”?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:56:26
Me too... I sell my gains at every $100 price increment...so sold gains at 9K...
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:20:45
Japan crypto exchanges see 200% increase in new accounts; China says holding BTC likely legal; AT&amp;T; Robinhood; Fidelity; Ameritrade; 60 minutes; Bakkt; Coinbase custody seeing $150M+ inflows PER MONTH; CME seeing record BTC futures trading (in the billions); spot settled BTC funds (Grayscale) seeing inflows at a premium (~$10K per BTC)... WTF are we not &gt;$10K?

I have no background in trading whatsoever but seems like if we hit 9K once, a second time is more likely. Again just speaking out of my a**.
