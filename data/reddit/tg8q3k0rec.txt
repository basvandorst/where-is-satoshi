Don't tell them about your bitcoin stash. It's good practice to keep it private anyhow. Telling them that you'd saved some money for a gift and then changed your mind would be spiteful. Stay classy! Your old man is probably just jealous and confused. Take the high road on this one.

People here tend to really love hardware wallets. I don't trade much and I'm a tight-arse so I prefer a paper wallet. I also like to be a little more involved with the nuts and bolts of moving coins around when I need to. It has also made claiming coins from forked chains pretty easy. I don't think that it's necessary to move your coins to a hardware wallet. I recommend using BIP-38 encryption for your paper wallets and storing a few copies in different locations.

Those bastards at ViaBTC. How rude.

Fuck off. No one is that stupid.

Yes, some wallets support this. It is "importing" a private key instead of "sweeping".

You use bitaddress to create paper wallets. You'll need another wallet for transacting. Not all of them support importing a private key. I know that Electrum will do it though. I have used it to create transactions that spend from multiple paper wallets (to multiple addresses). You can use the paper wallets again if you like.

Maybe he's been using reddit for longer than two weeks under a different account?

Multisig looks like a good way to enhance security.

I bet that the CGT liability arises on selling, not on withdrawing funds. As a follow-up question, when does the exchange report information to the government?

Yes, a very good article.

Ethereum is a scam that hasn't run its full course yet.

That's cool. What's the consensus there?

It's just noise.

Earning through the trade of goods and services, stealing and gambling are alternatives.

It sure is! This was a pretty good article.

I'm not convinced that this dude spending 700 BTC a few years ago did much for the price today. I'm pretty sure he'd be better of if he'd held the BTC.

That's the way to do it. 
You can derive public keys from private keys (including encrypted keys) here:

Yeah, the US way is fucking nonsense.

That's a healthy stash!
