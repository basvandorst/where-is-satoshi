Yep.  Had the same issue,  emailed them and it was sorted in a couple hours.  I believe the website even said to email them right on the withdrawal page.

Good on you!

Wicked! Thanks man.

Thank you, this makes the most sense.
There is no tag associated with the address they are coming from.
Is there a way to get them out of my pending transactions? I am using the Bitcoin QT client. It's not the end of the world having them in there, but it's annoying that there are 5 or 6 useless transactions always showing up at the top of my list each time I look at it.
Thanks again.

It's coming to old addresses I don't use anymore that I created specifically to receive mining profits.

I'm not super worried about it, I just don't understand why anybody would throw around small amounts of coin like that.

Got woken up by that song a couple hours earlier than i would normally get up because i left my computer’s volume on.  Wasn't even mad.

I would be interested to know the answer to this as well.

I'm not looking to move back to the city, but that is a good location. Good luck with the sale.

I feel that, so far I am only using Cavirtex, and the 3% fees suck. I just got verified at MT.Gox so I will try them next. I'm with the ATB, I will let you know how it goes.
