He did not know what he was doing and did not seek for help. Just because someone can't use the most low level code due to lack of knowledge does not mean it doesn't work, if he just used FileZilla with Storj to upload some files there would be no problem, instead he decided to go the hard route with CLI's and setting up bridges.

It was just a matter of time before this was posted here so let me elaborate. Andreas did not know what he was doing, a simple question to Storj support would solve all hist issues. Not only that, all his statements are false, let me explain.
1. First he stated that there is no documentation for Libstorj, which is a lie, there is: 
2. He stated that he could not upload anymore, well that is obvious because he hit the free tier limit, which is explained **everywhere** in our documentation.
3. The statement that uploading/downloading with Storj is not user friendly just makes me laugh, mainly because he decided to use a CLI instead of the GUI, he was just asking for it.
4. Running a bridge is not easy, if you run a bridge you have to run all the other services, basically you create you own "Storj", this includes farmers, billing, complex... Just ripping open a bridge package and thinking it will just run right from the start is like giving a quantum mechanics book to a 1 year old, it isn't going to work.
His intentions were clear, spreading FUD about Storj, i will make sure everyone realized this. cheers.

2 issues that could easily be resolved if he had just contacted Storj support. Braydon is also a original core developer, he is still there, so not sure what you are trying to say,.
