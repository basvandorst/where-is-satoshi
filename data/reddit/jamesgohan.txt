This last sentence is interesting. Are they saying that reorganization attempts have failed and that they will be opening up to people filing claims for liquidation?

"Sargent said it is definitely an option if the system is stable as it is potentially even more convenient than gold. But as it is a virtual currency, a certain need of trust about a virtual society and virtual environment is needed, he added."
-Thomas Sargent
"We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with 
the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of 
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we 
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions 
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes 
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes 
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are 
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can 
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what 
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of 
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on 
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

Thank you. More info on the green please.
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:51:20
I would think it does because a rise in price would increase interest and demand for bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-03 07:22:17
I do not think that is the case. I think it is a case of mismanagement and poor accounting as a result of that. A minor hit from the Malleability bug caused the books to be flagged. Furthermore, crowd analysis has revealed that the original cold wallets owned by Gox are still intact and untouched. This is good news.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:11:55

@_date: 2014-03-03 07:09:28
Here is the real reason MT Gox halted all operations. It is NOT because they were running away..


Once we discovered that bitcoins had disappeared and the discrepancies between cash funds and deposit balances, we judged that it would be difficult to continue our activities normally and we therefore closed our site at noon on the 25th (Japan time).

Same here. At the end of the day, I converted 5 bitcoin into 33 gox bitcoins. Only time will tell, but the possibilities are astounding.

The right idea, until I saw the childish photoshop of Mark as Dr. Evil on the cover page and the reak of personal vendetta against Mark throughout this unprofessional business plan. I actually think that the restructuring currently being done under supervision of the Japanese and US Courts will result in something similar to this plan. With shares being given out in proportion and any remaining assets distributed accordingly.
In my opinion, people who are lucky enough to own shares in Gox will be extremely wealthy in a few years.

Best case scenario, the inventor of possibly the world's saving revolutionary monetary protocol has secured his/her/their own financial freedom for life and their family forever.  Worst case scenario, they could choose to corrupt it,  but that would mean destroyimg their own wealth. There are mkre important things in life than money. 
Furthermore, if Nakamoto decides to put his bitcoins to use, with so many eyes on his original bitcoins, it wouldnt take the NSA to figure out who is spending them. Thats the beauty of the open source public ledger system.

Hey Andreas,
Failure is an option for you as well.
Andreas stated on letstalkbitcoin Episode  that Gox will survive and continue on for new noobies to be Goxed in the future. He also advocated that if you wanted to just trade and hold bitcoins, Gox can still be used as an on ramp. He clearly states that youc an wire fiat in, and withdraw bitcoins.
Keep in mind, this episode was released the day before the MTGox website went down. I personally took his advice and invested money into bitcoinbuilder after listening to Andreas advocate it as well.
Link: 
 When asked about the fate of Gox.
"So they're probably going to take longer than the other exchanges. but I expect that maybe 2-3-4 for weeks from now they are going to figure out how to do withdrawals again. People are going to realize they are solvent. They're going to release their bitcoin in one big run. but eventually they are going to get more comfortable again. Noobies are going to flood in. and Gox is going to continue to exist a year from now.
No I think they are not getting day traders. But if you wire dollars into Gox and convert into bitcoin and withdra bitcoin, it works fine. So if your primary goal is to buy and hold rather than day trade, you dont really need to withdraw fiat, it still can be used as an on ramp."
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:13:59
I didn't know bitcoins just arrived in the US. Were they shipped over from China? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:41:03
You guys do realize that litecoin is quite literally the Chinese knock off version of Bitcoin? A chinese man created litecoin based off of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:09:57
That's a very good point you make. If you think about it, it is quite obvious. Bitcoin is regulated by the laws of math; incorruptible by greed.

you do realize that some may call it hoarding, some may call it storing value AKA saving, but that is a big factor for which it gives bitcoin value. If it were merely for a means of exchange, then we might as well use seashells. People hoard cold hard cash too and speculate on different currency on FX exchanges.

From paypal's historical behavior, they are not ones to take actions that would improve their public image.

How would filing a lawsuit when Gox is already under bankruptcy protection help us get our coins back? Any attack such as this law suit you propose is not going to help us get our coins back any faster.

Absolutely. Scarcity and abundance have always been at odds with eachother. Bitcoin synergistically combines the benefits of both into one tight package. Much like your mother.

I think it would be more accurate to say the graduate release of the total supply of bitcoin. Inflation is a term for the increasing supply of currency in RELATION to demand.

Hi xxx,
Thank you for your inquiry. Before I answer your questions, I too would like to ask you 2 question in which I would appreciate if you answered oh so much.
(1) What is your intention for the money I have deposited with you? eg. loan, investments, executive bonuses
(2) What is the purpose of the profits you make from my deposits with you? eg. To pay off electricity bills, salaries, etc.
Thanks again for offering to let you know if I had any questions for you! lots of hugs and kisses!

Yes, if you read his postings before he dissapeared, he writes about how his vision of specialized computers being kept in homes in cold climates and used as heaters, therefore making the cost of electricity to run the bitcoin protocol negligible. This is so because the energy used to produce the heat during the computations is comparable to the amount of electricity used in heaters.
Here is his quote from 
"Aug. 9, 2010: If you’re using electric heat where you live, then your computer’s heat isn’t a waste. It’s equal cost if you generate the heat with your computer. If you have other cheaper heating than electric, then the waste is only the difference in cost. If it’s summer and you’re using A/C, then it’s twice. Bitcoin generation should end up where it’s cheapest. Maybe that will be in cold climates where there’s electric heat, where it would be essentially free."

well lets look at gold and how people used gold coins as a medium for exchange. kings and governments figured out a way to corrupt and inflate the gold money supply by melting and diluting the coins. why do you think they would do that? To confiscate wealth through forced inflation. before bitcoin, we did not have a safe and secured form of money that was inherently deflationary, even though we instinctually sought one out.

Ebay powerseller here. They held my funds and sent me the same letter. They also asked me to digitally sign an addendum to their T&amp;C regarding bitcoin miners and an explanation of my business model for doing business on Ebay,  as well as upload documents for evidence. I was tempted to fax in my ass as a document.  WHY THE FUCK DO I NEED THEIR PERMISSION TO DO BUSINESS. 
I walked away from ebay/paypal and never looked back.
