To prevent an endless loop, I'd say we agree on the fundamentals. We probably just differ on the blame allocation.  I imagine it something like some crime lord with a sniveling assistant whispering stuff into his ear to encourage him.  The crime lord is the primary target, but the sniveling assistant actively participated and has some percentage of the guilt.

This is the core of the broken system.  The regulations have created behemoths that have "make money" as the driving philosophy vs what historically was "create value that earns money".  That's why we had a turn leadership in companies coming from the product side of the house to almost entirely the financial side.  Regulations make business is all about financial and political maneuvering instead of customer satisfaction.
In the end, if they sent a guy to Washington to deliver a message of fear to try get money, that's fraudulent behavior.  It's the equivalent of someone saying "Don't use the competing product because you'll die of cancer".

There's not one original critique in the entire thing. It's just the same regurgitated arguments combined with the same smug predictions of failure that we've heard for years.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:32:56
At the time, that would have been $5.75 million in bitcoin.  Again, that's an absured amount of money to keep in something so risky. You'd know that if you showed up around here for more than this singular opportunity to get your kick in during a down-swing.
Unless your stance is that an entrepreneurial person who made a lot of money by creating a service that people enjoy can't possibly have anything to say when losing a quarter of million?  If you want to make that kind of money, quite trying to count other people's money and go do something constructive so you have money of your own to count.

You're making quite a few assumptions here.
That sale of his [happened back in July]( when the value was about $90.  And you're assuming that he kept all his money in bitcoin rather than diversifying to safer investments like gold and silver.  Even the most die-hard bitcoiner acknowledges that bitcoin is still risky.  So why would anyone with half a brain keep a significant amount of their wealth in one, risky place?
The answer is "they wouldn't".
But you're right.  Obvious agenda is obvious here...

Ah.  I see.  So that's how you're playing it.
Very well.


This right here, once again, says it all.
You wish to believe that morality does not exist in a vacuum.  Morality, to you, is simply defined by the government, which (as you stated) is a product of the mob (or as you termed it "society").  This is about as backwards as a fundamentalist bible-thumper who asks "without God and threat of heaven and hell, how do you know what is good or bad?"
In your case, you've replaced the God of Abraham with the state.
But in both cases, this is a statement of a pseudo-intellectual sociopath who clings to moral relativism to fill their absence of empathy.  Since you are incapable of comprehending morality, you look to mob rule to define it for you.
Contrary to your *belief*, right and wrong, do exist in a vacuum.
Slaughtering people because they don't believe in your deity is wrong, even if your people interpret that action as the will of your god.
Slavery was immoral even when it was accepted by the world as necessary for manual labor.
Beating a woman for not bearing a son is immoral even when the world viewed females as property.
And being forced at gunpoint to give the fruits of your labor to people who happen to have a flag is immoral even though it is common practice today.
So, you are correct on one thing.  There is a flawed belief system here.  However, that flaw is not identifiable by those who are incapable of recognizing right and wrong beyond the dictates of the mob.

I guess I'd need your definition of theft.


This is where it's my turn to blank stare.
So, because I live somewhere that was marked off by a group of people as their country, I'm forced to give them money?  Argue all you want about "the roads".  But just because they did something semi-constructive with a fraction of my dollar they took by force doesn't make the action benevolent.
The mob operates in the same way with "protection money".  And if some rival gang came sniffing around, you'd be damn sure I'd expect my protection service I "paid" for.  But that doesn't change the fact that they still stole my money.


That's actually not true.  If I disagree with you, I'm forced to go along with your position with the penalty of you sending men with guns after me.
On the other hand, if you disagree with me, my position doesn't impose any force on you.

Wow...just...wow.   Everything else you said in this is built upon these core ideas. Not only do I emphatically disagree with them, I find them entirely insulting to everyone in the country.  And it's not only because of my view on the role (or lack thereof) for government.  There are many who would consider themselves hardcore liberals would also find this insulting.
First off government is **not** society.
Next, when you say:


...you're flat out saying that you believe all humans owe their very lives to government.  Otherwise, as you said, they "probably wouldn't even make it to adulthood".
And there really isn't much more to say after that.  I can argue with all your points, but all those points are rooted here...in this line.  And this stems from your Hobbesian belief about man in a state of nature.
On the other hand, I have more of a Lockean idea about man.  And that all people have a right to life, liberty, and property.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And that all prosperity is derived from these.
From this point, we might as well be arguing about whether Shinto or Christianity is the "correct" religion.

Ah...thank you for this very detailed answer.  I think this answers my question.
So then once I send btc from my wallet to some address, it's just another isolated address with that amount of btc sitting into it.
Now, just so I can be sure I (sorta) have the complete picture, is this correct:  From my example before where I sent 3BTC to three different addresses in one wallet, lets say I then send 3BTC to another address in one shot.  I know the entire balance of an address gets "used up" in transactions.  Does that mean that it appears in the blockchain as these 3 addresses sending 1BTC to some location together?

Then you should be able to understand that volunterists are using the literal interpretation of "an-archy" to be "no ruler".  Just because you differ on what you perceive to be a ruler (based on your beliefs about who owns land) doesn't make the anarcho-capitalist interpretation any less valid.
In fact, see think your definition is just as backward since it implies the need to steal from others  based on the idea that "the collective" owns all resources by default", much like governments do by drawing arbitrary lines and clicking" flood fill".
That said, I've long grown tired of that acedemic debate.  I settled with "volunterist" since that carries the same idea I would try to convey with "anarchist".

TIPS is certainly better than keeping cash.  But considering CPI is highly understated, especially when factoring in gross overstatement of price drops with hedonic adjustments, this "inflation protection" is "mild inflation dampening" at best.


And risk is the cost of the yield.

You chose two peaks in an effort to illustrate a point. I demonstrated that given the dates you provided, it functions perfectly as asset protection. Sure, you could stack the deck by doing what you said and compare a peak to a valley. You could compare arbitrary dates in the stock market and do the same stacking. But looking at the long term trend is more telling.
At the inception of the Fed, gold was $20. [$20 at that time had the purchasing power of $500]( Or rather, given the same purchasing power, gold is more than twice as valuable.
Sure, compared to the stock market, that's nothing. But it also illustrates why it function as a conservative protection of wealth.
Someone is a fool if they have all the money in gold. But someone is foolhardy to have it all in the stock market or other intently risky investments.

Great use of weasel words there, "inflation adjusted".  As you alluded to, gold is not an "investment".  It's asset protection.  Which means the whole point is to avoid the "inflation adjustment".
And given the dates you picked, you perfectly illustrated this function.  [$650 in 1980 had the same purchasing power as $1885 in 2011](  In other words, if you held on to that $650 instead of buying gold. you would have lost more than half the purchasing power while the value of the gold was almost exactly the same.
That said, "asset protection" and "investment" are two different things. Investments are inherently risky.  Yes, the markets as a whole are tend to rise over time, but individual investments are winners and losers.  A midldle class or wealthy person can put in enough money to pay someone to manage this risk full time.  So they are wise to have a foundation of protected assets enhanced by investments.  A poor person doesn't have this option as readily available to them.  If they could stash a dollar and know that it will buy a "dollars worth" of stuff 10 years from now, they can build some level of safety for the future.
