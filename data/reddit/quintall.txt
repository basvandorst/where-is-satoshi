1.000 Dollar would have been enough, he wouldnt have been all in by far and he, his family, you, his children, his grandchildren and everyone else would be cashed out for all time :)

Chinese level design, the scam is real
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:59:20
Kind acts like this give me hope for humanity. Or at least for this reddit :D
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:37:43
WTF happened to forbes ? 
This reads more like a sun article or tmz or some sh*t....
really bad to see, everything for the clicks it seems....
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:01:40
Everything they write in their article is outdated the next day @ bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:30:59
I only ever see anti 2X posts or reddits, why is this a thing then ?
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:37:31
Sell, sell now and never come back !!!^^
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:26:39
As the Community is so devided in this, November will be brutal on bitcoin and only helping bitcoin cash. This will be a clusterfuck and then we have a Chinese miner altcoin taking over :((
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:24:49
Im pretty sure there is going go be a fork however high that number is either way...
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:50:24
Because Goldman Sachs said so. Just do what they say and youll be rich i tell ya  ! ^^
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:34:50
All the talk feels so far back, but its only 2014/15/ :D
Like when you watch old childhood footage :)
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:35:44
whos by now a millionaire?^^
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:31:35
This wont work, sincce he meant bcash...
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:31:55
THIS is probl. the biggest threat to bitcoin there is... two sites of hardcore supporters fighting over bitcoin until dead... this will get very ugly come november...
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:58:45
Sure dude, for example:
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:55:32
Right now most of the money a Bank lends isnt Money someone else saves but just Money that gets created in the Second the loan gets paid out. With btc you can already directly loan your coins to someone who wants to get Credit, google coin lending.... a much healthier approach, less currency destroying :))
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:36:10
Andreas should be the star of every bitcoin movie to come, we have it as a global currency in 12 months :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:59:54
So we get another fork... you people should stop buying cuz the price probl. comes crashing down since its a pretty hostile fork...
and we will see who stands supreme after that, but while the war goes on there will prob. be some cheap bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:32:53
People should clarify that he always talks about Bitcoin Cash when he means bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:46:00
I dont know why there are the type of traders that need to tell everyone how great they catch every dip and sell perfectly at the peak...
Really, who else cares? i understand that people want to share that with their wife / husband, but everyone on the internet?
i love the insights some people give in these subs, but dont really understand  the circle jerk sometimes...
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:35:14
I was waiting on this one :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:52:27
i definitly start buying @ 10 $ a bitcoin, then ill be RICH I TELL YA !
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:49:11
nice idea of stealing rich peoples Coins, but you wont get any im afraid. bitcoin whales arent whales because they give away their coins for bloody nothing
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:22:45
go to a PC seminar near you !
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:10:00
On the surface, the idea of $10,000 Bitcoin sounds crack-smoking ridiculous. At such a meteoric level, the digital coin’s price tag would exceed Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) tenfold
What is he talking about ? a price of 10.000 BTC would mean roughly double our marketcap today, wich is no where near those firms...
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:59:50
Bringing turmoil into the btc community, when we implement 2x we maybe get the bch people back here and be stronger alltogether!!
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:21:36
omagood my great great great great great great great great great great great great grandkids will be rich AF !!!
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:09:16
He bought 2 million worth eth when it was under 5 dollar, so cudos... but with btc I'm more with mcafee and his projection (250.000$ 3 years) as long as USA doesn't put jail time on all crypto holders or some other shit
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:08:16
You sure you remember 2007 right ? ^^
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:23:47
When people have hodl´d through MtGox, you will hodl trough that dip son !
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:31
Hes right :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:31
Hes right :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:33:38
Can you blame em? there is so much FUD about 2x around, if i havent gotten any BTC by now i wouldnt do that right now either.
If the FUD stays high you can expect lower prices when november comes closer, and after the shit hit the fan and hopefully everything played out nice we can go on with the developement.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:21:14
-remind me! never cuz this shit aint gonna happen
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:52:10
This has to be more out there guys, sell your shitcoins but spend your Bitcoins!
Refill them ofc Instant :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:29:14
Ye sure, be true you had it before!
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:37:08
Can i say that here?
Fuck em.
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:24:02
Most surely the BTC price will go up because people like airdrops.
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:34:47
Things like this will destroy bitcoin. Some people will always follow new things, some people will stick to the old... and only the chinacoin will win ;(
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:05:15
"Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro." From the post of the original hodl meme. If you arent one of those traders, you should draw a line in the sand where you dont want to go under else it hurts. as long as you stay above that line, try to buy the dip, add to your stash.
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:28:23
Why should they want 2X? They are all bcash fans in that reddit, they dont like bitcoin at all
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:13:24
? Bitcoin IS innovation dude...
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:28:14
When did get concquered in the first place?
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:08:01
Hahah, selling, not bellow 1 million dude... but everyone who wants to give me cheap coins plz plz sell :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:40:03
No, a centralized Blockchain is just something we have had for the last 50.000 years since people can write, a ledger.
It has no use if you just swap your centralized book in wich you write transactions to a centralized blockchain. but those banks dont get it.

Got an out of Office message from an Indian Customer Today (Austria here) thats saying gone for diwali :))
Never heard of it before, so Enjoy!!!
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:22:31
I can tell you why, because its all about Bitcoin, BTC, Bit Coin, and only Bitcoin :) the other cryptos live and die with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:44:23
Was it at least the best tech they had back then ? ^^
what was the price then ? just wondering :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:22:27
I got a nice Treasure chest thats waiting for These prices, so come, come !!
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:31:24
So overinvested People got fucked, no News here. Even when the reasons as you described are really hurting :((
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:25:25
have my vote!
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:54:17
Well but what should we do?
Miners will follow trough, B2X gets the hash, Bitcoin will have no blocks, adjusts in 20 weeks = dead.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:47:41
Why did people buy my investment in the crash when i didnt sell ? or am i the stupid one who did sell at the bottom?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:39:02
The most important Aantonop video to the right time, this should be viewed by EVERYONE in the whole crypto space.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:42:26
I do the same, but only because i dont want to pay any taxes and am a bad trader alltogether :))
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:06:12
More like Joseph Smith....
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:47:55
Can someone send this to r/btc, maybe they can still wake up. Why is roger and jihann so deep into big blocks..
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:28:37
if its time spend you enjoyed theres nothing to worry about your decision, yesterday is always the best time to buy, second best is now when u believe the fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:31:07
I dont get it why bigblockers often scream about fees, everytime i send BTC from exchanges to my wallet i never had any high fees.. just now i sendet 0.77 btc and the fee was 0,00027942 BTC.
Doesnt seem like much to me?
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:16:47
totally different for me, paid 98 € for trezor and nano would have been more expensive, funny..
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:10:06
Fuckin Remind me of this in 1 year u stupid Bot !!!
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:35:45
He does it to divide bitcoin, so that bitcoin cash can win in the long run. divide et impera, worked great the last couple thousand years, will work in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:37:06
When you hear Ver talking you know that hes a smart guy, i liked all his important publicity for bitcoin in the past in front of all those news anchors asking him dump questions, he just kept fighting for bitcoin. 
The thing with Bcash is pretty sad, im very sorry to loose him to that, but you cant help it... maybe he comes back, im pretty sure hes still big in bitcoin just to be safe :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:44:55
Dont post that in rogers reddit 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:37:08
You hoped for BCash to take over don't you? Sorry dude...
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:48:16
This comment is the answer my friend. weak hands get shaken, you will regret selling now on the longterm. or not :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:22:45
go to a PC seminar near you !
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:49:40

@_date: 2017-09-04 09:10:44
You sir, must be rich AF :D
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:46:20
:living a few years of your life like most people wont:
Dont people understand not to overinvest?
Jeez, all this all in is so stupid, you should never limit yourself in your daily live, else you will be super sad when you have to terminate your bitcoins for fiat when you need them, or worse, you need your fiat and your bitcoin just had a big dump.
