Give it a few days and it should show up in your account.  Happened to me when my cc got declined one time.

They and this sub have made it very clear that their wire transfers are currently backlogged.

Sell it all to fiat.  Withdrawal $1000 + tax owed on the $2000 gain.  Reinvest the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:21
Now is not the time to start day trading...  You'll get left in the dust
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:25:41
I'll take a miner over ads any day.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:30:11
Very strong post.  Someone gild this man.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:41
I don't see why anyone is panicking over this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:34:29
Yes.  He bought 1 BTC for $1000 and only sold .33 for $1000.  Maths not correct but point made is.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:13:59
Everyone is cashing out to fiat to cover taxes.  It's better to cash out now than at 16k.  Pay less capital gains this year.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:40:56
In short he means buy.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:50:01
Watch out this guys stroking as well.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:04:12
Well I'd see if it's still in that online wallet...
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:43:41
Both.  I go with first purchases first out. You have to look at the price in which you bought and sold that initial amount and again the second purchase and sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:46
Please share your book once you've made 5k.
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:42:25
Nah, these guys are just a bunch of dicks.  Good on you man.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:01:05
Bank transfer to Gdax and pay no fees.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:38:11
Get a ledger and slowly add to it.  You'll quit caring about the price if you're looking long term.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:12:19
Trading bots putting out feelers.

You're fine.  If you're worried about getting in trouble keep track of what you bought it for and how much you bought.  Every purchase using that BTC or trade from now on is a taxable event.
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:23:56
I bought all my Christmas presents this weekend.  Will rebuy in January February.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:52:09
Day trade and lose money of course.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:46:19
I agree just wish we had more options for paying in Bitcoin.  Egifter is great for Target and Microsoft but that's about it.  Overstock.com sucks terribly.  Newegg is the only online store that really accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:48:15
FIFO as long as you can show the trades if not then tax as if you invested $0.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:28:18
They have to report it if there is any suspect of the money being used illegally or for money laundering.  Just wait until they investigate which could be a while.  The reason they can't say anything is because it's now considered an ongoing investigation.
Now if you did do anything shady you might be out of luck.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:38:59
Also NewEgg.  All my electronics purchased with BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:36:39
Future FOMO in the works.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:47:05
Agreed.  It really depends on how big your market is.
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:08:35
They just bought Poloniex
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:24:01
Mines BTC/USD.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:04:44
I was thinking $37.50 but I'll take your word for it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:10:13
Not your keys not your Bitcoin.
