I never deposit or withdraw more than €2000. It's just not worth it if it goes missing.

Ethereum caught up yesterday, we'll need another jump for that to go up again I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:56:20
It just the way it goes, there are thousands of people waiting to get verified on Coinbase, I'm waiting on another £1k bank transfer that is also experiencing a delay. When those people start buying the price will soar again. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:02
Ethereum is tanking, litecoin and ripple dropped in the last 2 hours as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:33:56
Well if everyone panicked then a complete crash would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every asset needs hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:38
I'm holding, only put a grand in so far so I'm not sweating too much right now. 
I am slightly annoyed though because I was trying to sell around $18300 a few hours ago to gain on the volatility and now this has happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:57:49
Someone with a large holding has just dumped their coins yes. It's now happened back to back within a few minutes so they are seriously trying to tank the price. It will recover. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:47:13
It's recovering already, stop panicking. Trade off the volatility if you're that concerned about going long.

A surprising amount of people do their Christmas shopping on Christmas Eve. Also don't forget that there will be a lot of drinks bought this week. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:17:24
Bought 0.07 at $17,900 thinking that was the correction. Let's hope things pick up in January although it will have to defy stock market history as it's not a very bullish month. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:09:07
Bitcoin's dominance just fell below 40% for the first time, that's an 8% drop in a week. Cause for concern? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:29
T minus 38 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:24:38
I wouldn't say I'm getting nerves, I didn't go balls deep into Bitcoin I just day trade that and Ethereum. Bought ETH at $720 this morning though so it seems I can't win today ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:42:30
XRP will be successful in the long run, this is just showing what happens when clueless speculators jump on a bandwagon. When BTC goes up again the same will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:48:45
Some news outlets care, Fox News come up with absolute horseshit about cryptocurrency and we know they have vested interests. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:20:47
This is arbitrage, as more veteran traders join cryptocurrency trading and the exchanges become more sophisticated these gaps will close. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:56
They're just delaying the inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:17
Economics. Sudden drops like that back to back do not occur naturally.

Everyone and their dog wants to invest in it right now, there will be more speculative buying for a while yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:12:21
That doesn't explain why the alts are bleeding right now as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:14:50
To be honest if people are cashing out for Christmas then that's money you really shouldn't be investing in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:04:25
Were you expecting it to keep climbing by $1000 a day or more? There's so much buzz around it that it'll be up to $19k again by the end of the day anyway. I'm looking to make a tidy profit off a couple of limit orders from this small dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:17:20
Step your game up, I've got an app tracking 5 cryptos from the taskbar. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:34:43
Fuck sake of course my last trade of the day was on the verge of the biggest dip of the day. Hopefully it holds tight overnight and gets back to $16.2k when the europeans wake up. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:00:49
These news outlets are so desperate for it to crash and burn so their buddies and owners in the financial sector can continue to scam us. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:46
I bought in at $17,900k a few hours ago thinking that was the furthest this dip would go. Banter. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:24:13
You're assuming that people are rational thinkers. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:47:33
Credit. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:51
It's a commodity right now, it probably won't be the dominant coin in the long run but there is considerable buzz around it. I still expect it to hit $25k at least within a few months. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:54
You want to sell in the one week of the year that the majority of people have very little disposable income? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:36:45
I've literally been trading off $200 price movements, makes some nice profit. I always said if this happened I would hold until it recovers or crashes though, so here we are. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:54:12
I wouldn't even say it's a rival of Bitcoin, even if it feels like that now. They can both coexist but the overall market cap needs to keep growing and the investors need to become slightly less excitable. I can't imagine how much money some people must be losing by jumping back and forth and not being contrarian. 
I bought in on XRP at 0.55 and 0.65 so my small losses on BTC don't feel too painful right now. I expect both to grow in future though. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:18:13
NYE bull market with the lads. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:09:50
Hedge funds have no interest in raising the price of an asset, they hedge them to achieve a stable rate of interest. All that means is that cryptocurrency is now tangible enough to attract their interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:00
If/when Bitcoin dies it won't be with a bang, it will be with a whimper. When drops like this happen there are just as many people buying low thinking they will profit from it, causing it to recover again. 
We are ages away from it going bust though in my opinion. Hold tight. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:08:08
The Big Short. Also read All The Devils Are Here by Bethany McClean and Joe Nocera. 
For those who might be interested in the economics discipline, some notable academic papers on the crisis [here]( [here]( and [here](
I did a whole masters degree on the failures of regulation and the post-GFC economy ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:46:56
I like All The Devils for the backstory on how the mortgage backed security evolved over time. Gives an insight into how financial innovations get greenlighted. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:46:46
Regulatory loopholes. If there was legally a time of day that someone was allowed to rob your house, would you blame the thief or the lawmakers? This is pretty much what happened with Basel capital framework, off balance sheet securitisation and credit derivatives. An individual will always seek to increase their utility when presented with perverse incentives. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:14:02
It's pointless blaming the bankers for exposing the inefficiencies in regulation. Research credit risk transfer and then tell me how the SEC and the Federal Reserve allowed FIs to trade these credit derivatives over the counter to each other. Are they braindead? Economics has been asleep at the wheel for nearly 40 years and this is the kind of result we get from that. 
Want to free up capital? That's fine, just move all your assets to off-balance sheet facilities. Idiots like Alan Greenspan claimed this was good for the banking system. 
Blame the rulemakers, not those who took advantage of their incompetence. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:28:06
Most entertaining too, although I enjoyed watching 'respected' academics from the monolithic economics community squirm under questioning in Inside Job.

This is now showing all the symptoms of a speculative bubble, bear in mind that there will be a last round of investors who will get burned. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:54:36
In 2000 people were investing in worthless companies because they had .com on the end of their name. People are dumb and will jump on a bandwagon once it appears to be easy money. When you associate something with the internet or technology, people also tend to become overoptimistic. The main question is whether we have reached that point yet, as that is when the asset will begin to soar above it's intrinsic value. 
Even so standard economic theory can still apply, the first major drop and risk averse investors will offload, causing a crash. It's a volatile investment, can I say for certain that it will crash? Of course not, I would just be surprised if it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:38:51
Half the people investing don't understand it. That's precisely how the dotcom crash happened in the first place. My point is that people will be lumping money on simply because it's going up, that always ends badly. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:38
Bitcoin is not worthless but no one knows what it's intrinsic value is. There will be a point where it surges past that due to over optimism. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:07:07
I wouldn't short it either, that's the thing about bubbles, they're unpredictable! If it doesn't crash though it would go against everything I've learned from studying economics. This has shades of Dotcom all over it. 
It would literally only take one price drop for everyone to panic and offload right now. Steer clear.
