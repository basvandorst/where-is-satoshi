I totally agree with you that the price could just shoot up or down unexpectedly. That does happen, but then it usually falls in line with some sort of steady movement in a direction, similar to stocks.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:11:15
Analyzing the trends gives some very interesting insights on where the price MAY be headed. I don't think it is totally worthless, but to each his own. Unrelated question, why do they call kocknocker? ;))

Hi friendly stranger. It may, but on July 15 the price broke through below an ascending trendline. So, technically, we received a short-term trend reversal signal from upward to downward. It seems that now is an excellent opportunity to short.
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:59:06
Thanks. Check out TradingView in order to analyze and create charts as well. They have plenty of lines to choose from! I prefer the upwards ones, but all they had were downwards ones today. :))
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:31:21
It hasn't just yet. It is on the upper trend line at the moment. If it breaks past it, that is good news that it will keep going up and break out of this current trend. If it doesn't and continues on with this trend, I can see it going down to $9,300.

No, you're good man. Just don't pay any attention to TA if you don't like it. It takes more energy to get mad and criticize something than it does to keep scrolling. But it is kind of expected when I post this because every comment section usually has one or two people voicing their negative opinion about TA. But anyway Frank, good luck with your trading buddy!
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:49:23
I also noted that on my analysis. If there is some volume to back this increase, then we could really be going places!
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:43:55
I know Mark, you told me last time.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:32:07
All good man. To each his own. Good luck trading, and let's hope for another bull run!
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:56:18
Waiting for your response Mark. :))
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:31:16
Hello again Mark! :))
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:38:01
You're absolutely right. I should draw the lines longer! Haha (dad joke). But in all seriousness, I don't look at TA as a magic crystal ball that will tell you the future of the stock, I look at it as a way to evaluate the risk. To me, the chart I posted would be a warning that I shouldn't buy at this moment. But, to each his own. I know that I will not change anybody's opinions here on Reddit. I am just trying to share my analysis in the hopes that somebody finds it interesting and we could have a discussion.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:12:45
No, I'm not, I guess the only troll here is you.
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:47:31
Hey, I understand your concerns as you have voiced them on my last couple of posts, and I know TA is never 100% accurate, but just to show some credibility for myself, here is a chart that I published that was quite accurate. I am not saying I am perfect, and people have to understand to do their own research, but I thought maybe I could share my analysis with this community.
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:53:25
Thanks for your feedback Mark.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:31:02
Oops. Good catch! Unfortunately, once you publish on that website you only get 15 minutes to make changes. I hope people know what I meant!

Thanks buddy!
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:48:40
Thanks for the reply. You beat me to the response. Yeah, it just made a big move and collapsed. Let's see what the future holds.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:20:32
A nice upward trend formed on the 1 hour chart. The bullish divergence from yesterday looked nice, so hopefully the upward trend will continue. Check out my TA here:  
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:48:55
Thanks for your advice. I will definitely google the word reseach. Hopefully, it will help me understand. Happy trading friend!
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:24:10
How was it off? If you bought at the buying range I listed and sold at the selling range, then you would have profited before the price dipped back down. Can you explain how I was wrong? Thanks! :))
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:58:58
Okayyyy. Thanks for the friendly chat buddy. Wish you well!
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:11:32
The TA was short term. If you bought at $10,200 and sold at $10,600 then you made $400 before the price dropped back down to $10,200. At this point, the TA was accurate. I also said in the description that the volatility is low, so it is not expected to move much unless it clearly breaks the resistance point. It clearly broke the resistance point, the volatility increased and the price took off. I understand that you are trying hard to prove that you are right, and that's all good, but at least be fair with what you are saying. Thanks, and happy trading! :))
@_date: 2019-08-16 09:58:32
I noticed a nice upward trend that we are on. It looks like it has space to $10,600. I am still remaining bullish on this despite the dip.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:14:01
You're welcome friend. Hope this gave you some insight. Analyzing the charts is quite interesting, if you have an interest, maybe consider creating an account on tradingview and create some for yourself as well. :))
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:34:51
No, everything is fine for now. I'm selling at the next resistance ($10,600) to make some quick gains. Hopefully, it reaches that point.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:07:40
Hey Mark, I know you don't believe in TA, but check this out. Isn't it beautiful? Press the play button to see the movement.[
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:32:23
It is already below $9,200, so the down scenario to $8,500 - $8,600 unwinds
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:18:11
certainly not, bro. just a follow-up question ;)
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:19:41
All good man. That is also a good option as it looks like it will continue this momentum. Hodl is not a bad strategy with Bitcoin these days! Thanks for your comment buddy, and I wish you the best with your trades! :))
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:06:13
Hopefully, it can gain some momentum. That crash a couple of days ago was a bummer. Happy trading buddy!
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:39:20
I don't think Mark is my type. :))
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:12:08
I am ready for a breakout! It just has to pass $12,400 for me to feel more comfortable.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:21:52
So, 12K is the next target ? Though, many expected a further drop to 6xxx area ...
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:52:47
Yes, but there are the key levels we consider when entering a speculative trade .. At the moment, the range is $9,200 - $9,600. A trade in either direction could be initiated only after the price breaks-out one of the boundaries
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:30:18
There have been some hard rejections at $12,000 but hopefully, this run-up could be the one that breaks out.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:31:25
Haha. I guess you are right. I should have said considerable. Happy trading buddy!
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:05:07
Thanks, friend. :))
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:22:38
Thanks for your opinion and I appreciate the constructive feedback. I was just looking at the charts and making observations and thought I would share. It is quite interesting to notice the movement and trends. If you don't like TA, it's all good. To each their own. Just glad to conversate with other Bitcoin enthusiasts. :))
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:53:34
Don't you think the price might test $9,000 before a drop to the lower range ?
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:08:13
Bitcoin broke out of an ascending triangle formation and it looks pretty good on the 4hr chart. The fast EMA (200) is right at the price, so we could see a bullish crossover. This looks like it may rise to the next resistance at \~$11,500 if it can hold \~$10,600 as a support level. Check everything out here and remain bullish guys!  
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:19:51
Hello again Mark! You didn't comment on my last post, I was getting worried. Glad to see you are ok! :))
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:32:08
The price resides at the key point of determination: either the Bulls will push it off $9,300 and sweep it up to the mid-term target of $12,000 or the Bears will force it down to the nearest Support at $8,500 - $8,600. [
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:34:17
Hi Mark. How have you been?
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:40:37
Thanks again for your insight. :))
