Coinbase support have been pretty good up til a month ago when I started to sell 3 of the 5 bitcoins I have with them. They are a legitimate company and I know they will set things right for me eventually. I know they are overloaded with support issues, but I think waiting for over a month for them to fix my problems is unacceptable. I have contacted their support numerous time and they have never addressed my issues so far. 
What happened was I placed a sell order back in late November to sell 3 bitcoin. I found out days later that the sell order had been cancelled. They credited my bank account momentarily and cancelled it right after. I never saw any of that money deposited in my bank account. So the right thing for them to do was credit back the 3 bitcoin to my coinbase account, which they did. I figure that's fine. I understand the company is fairly new and things won't always go as smooth. Then I figure I'll just try spending my bitcoin. The problem is that I wasn't able to do any of it. Every time when I tried sending any amount of bitcoin it would never get confirm and 24hrs later I receive an email telling me that the transaction is unconfirmed and the amount got credit back to my account. What is also outrageous was that I found out about 2 weeks after they credit back my 3 bitcoins they debited my bank account for the amount of $3015.08. What a shocker!
Well, it's been over a month and I can't do anything with my bitcoins. I hope they can resolve it soon. Thanks again blitzkrieg_cm for starting this thread. Otherwise, I would have never thought of coming here to complain about my problem with coinbase.
Here are some pics to show what had happened.
