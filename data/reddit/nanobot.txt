You'd be surprised how poorly some people plan out important life-changing decisions. A lot of smart people invest a lot of money they can't afford to lose into risky ventures without an exit strategy. Just because someone has the technical knowledge to find and exploit a security vulnerability doesn't mean they had the clarity of mind and sense to plan the end game.

Technical traders trading. The January 15 OTE short zone was $12419 - $13287 on Bitstamp, so we got relative unwillingness to buy in that range. There was a short-term OTE long zone at $11198 - $11594 which we dipped below twice (yesterday and today), and the recent drop started with that second dip. That was just a sensible trading decision for anyone who sold at that point, because a &gt;78.6% retracement almost always precedes a &gt;100% retracement.
Right now, we're in the January 17 OTE long zone, which is $10042 - $10685 on Bitstamp. That is where there will be relative unwillingness to sell. But if it gets below that $10042 level, expect lots of technical traders to suddenly sell with the expectation of the price hitting new lows.

A mere 30% retracement of the move to the ATH is, yes, near the ATH. Major price movements normally make around a 60%-80% retracement eventually, even dramatic price movements like what we saw in the past year. Every major ATH in Bitcoin's history has made a correction of about that amount (the 2013 bubble was even deeper, at around a 90% retracement). I would be very hesitant to buy at this point; it's basically a gamble.

Seriously. Anyone who is freaking out about the itty bitty decline we've had in the last few days should probably not be trading. The rises we've seen in February and April have been pretty wimpy, percentage-retracement-wise, and the $4.3k - $7.6k range would be a perfectly normal, comfortable place for the price to return for a while, even if you're looking at it as a long-term bull.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:15:45
The Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) zone off the entire January 2015 - December 2017 growth period is the $4328 - $7606 range (using Bitstamp for the numbers). Any price within that range is very normal at this point, given the price range of the bubble.
In addition, the consolidation period has been slipping downward (lower highs and lower lows). People who trade AB=CD setups are going to put downward pressure on the price until it reaches those targets, which are right at the bottom of that OTE zone. Specifically, there's an AB=CD target at $4596 and another at $4328.
To be clear, AB=CD targets are established in a completely different way from OTE zones. The fact that there just happens to be a major AB=CD target at the *exact dollar* of the very bottom of the OTE zone ($4328) tells me that these price movements are still being caused primarily by technical traders doing their technical trading, and not by regular joes trading on their gut and emotion.
*Hopefully* that remains the case, because the technical indicators make a strong case for $4328 being a great (but frighteningly close to the edge) price for a final bottom to start a new bull market. If we end up slipping below that, it would signal that Bitcoin is actually on a downtrend (like it was for a while after the 2013 bubble) rather than just a normal consolidation. Confirmation of a downtrend would be bad, since the market would then have to "start from scratch" to establish a new solid bottom (easily pushing the next growth period back by another year or two).

Did they incorporate a proof-of-work-based inverted lottery into the design, as I mentioned? I'm not seeing a mention of that.

The problem isn't that not enough people are hodling, the problem is that not enough people are buying. We're still in a medium-term bear market, and the recent price movements have set up price targets in the $4300 - $4500 range. There isn't going to be much interest in buying at $6300 when it's looking like we may be able to buy at $4500 in the near future.

To be honest, Bitcoin didn't exactly invent the idea of digital currency, or even decentralized digital currency. Lots of people saw the potential value in such a thing, long before Bitcoin. What Bitcoin brought to the table was a *means to achieve it*.

You're talking about reducing a saturated address space to a smaller address space algorithmically. That isn't what OP is talking about.
For starters, think about URL shorteners. The reason they work is because you don't have a shortened URL for every possible expanded URL, only the ones that users have selected for shortening.
Second, OP's suggestion is mainly about readability and memorability. That means the addresses wouldn't just be generated algorithmically, they'd be chosen by a human (at least in part). One option is something resembling an e-mail address (a scheme that PayPal users are already used to), but it could technically be done with simple DNS entries: nanobot.example.com could have a TXT record containing my public address, for example. This is obviously not a smart thing to do if you want anonymity, but it would be useful for businesses and others who are already publicly associating themselves with their public address.
Not every address would need such an entry, and, in fact, most wouldn't. Of the total address space available, it's likely that only an extremely small portion would have hand-set memorable addresses like this.

First of all, I've known Luke-Jr since before bitcoin existed. All of his opinions begin with his religious views. You can't talk about Luke-Jr's opinions without that context.
Second, here was his first comment in that thread:


New layers can be done on an opt-in basis, without polluting the blockchain and forcing non-participants to store the data.
He presented it in moral terms from the start. It's apparently wrong for people to "force" bitcoin nodes to store arbitrary data. He didn't present it as a technical issue, he presented it as a moral issue.
BTW, the question of whether he's an "asshole" (your word, not mine) is another topic. If you're interested in that question, I might mention that he believes a woman has no right to ever refuse sex from her husband under any circumstances (thus, he argues, there's no such thing as a man "raping" his wife). He also thinks we ought to have more inquisitions and punishment of "heretics". So... yeah.

That's a silly and arbitrary way to measure the price movement.

I first got into bitcoin when the price was around $800. I bought 10 bitcoins, and I've been trying to trade on swings, teaching myself about trading as I've gone along. I haven't injected any extra money into my trading account, so it's been all about trying to increase my holdings by trading.
Since I started, the price has halved, and my holdings have doubled. Considering that I haven't been doing *any* margin trading, I guess breaking even in a bear market is not too bad. And I've definitely gotten better at reading market signals as time has gone on, so that's something.

I don't understand why people even consider doing anything on margin. I made a life-changing amount of money in Bitcoin without ever touching that stuff. Just buy low (say, 25% - 40% the peak of the last big bubble), and then sell high (basically, any price higher than where you bought it). If it takes a year or two for the price to get higher than you bought it, then wait a year or two. If you *need* to sell early because you need the money, then it sounds like you screwed up by investing more than you could afford to lose.

The evidence that the hackers presented doesn't actually show what the hackers claim it shows. What they found was MtGox's balance sheet, which says that they're *supposed* to have all those bitcoins. But that doesn't mean they do.
Think of it this way: I have a bunch of treasure chests full of gold coins, and I'm burying them in my back yard. Every time I bury a chest, I update my spreadsheet to keep track of how many gold coins I have back there. But one day, I discover that somebody has dug up all of my chests and stolen my coins. Then, somebody else hacks into my computer, finds my spreadsheet, and claims that it's proof that I still have all of those gold coins. I don't; my spreadsheet only included my own bookkeeping of what I was supposed to have.

There's no transaction malleability flaw in the bitcoin protocol. The flaw is when *clients* try to track transactions in an unsound way.
A bitcoin transaction includes the transaction details, and the digital signature of those details. Because the details are signed, they are guaranteed to be preserved byte-for-byte between when the transaction is sent and when it gets confirmed on the blockchain. The signature has no such guarantee, and that's a property of the digital signature standard (not specific to bitcoin). You'd have to sign the signature, and sign *that* signature, etc.
But really, it shouldn't matter, since the only wiggle room that exists is inconsequential stuff like padding. It only matters if you misunderstand what the bitcoin protocol guarantees and what it doesn't. MtGox misunderstood this. They assumed that a hash of the entire transaction (including the signature) would represent unchangeable data. If they had instead used a hash of just the transaction details, they wouldn't have had a problem, because those details can't change.

With 30% hashing power, the chance to mine 6 blocks in a row in one attempt is 0.0729%.
The chance to *not* mine 6 blocks in a row in a given attempt is then 99.9271%.
For simplicity, I'm going to get sloppy now and pretend the 6-in-a-row thing is a single instantaneous event. Since you get 6 attempts per hour (1 per 10 minutes), the chance to *not* mine 6 blocks in a row in a given hour is 99.9271% ^ 6, or 99.5634%.
The chance to *not* mine 6 blocks in a row in a given day (24 hours) is then 90.0312%.
The chance to *not* mine 6 blocks in a row in a given week (7 days) is then 47.9459%, which means you're *more likely than not* to mine 6 blocks in a row at some point in a given week.
EDIT: By the way, the reason you need to do the calculations on the negative case instead of the positive case is that ^ is used for "and" conditions here. If something has a 30% success rate, 30% ^ 6 gives you the odds of it happening the first time *and* the second time *and* the third time, etc. But what you want for the latter calculations is the "or" condition (the 6-in-a-row event could happen in attempt 1 *or* attempt 2 *or* attempt 3, etc.) So you have to rewrite it as an "and" condition: it doesn't happen in attempt 1 *and* it doesn't happen in attempt 2, etc., and then you can take 100% minus the result to get your final chances.

It appears green if the last trade in that time period is higher than the first trade in that time period. The first trade is *not* the same as the last trade of the previous time period.

I've known Luke-jr for a long time. The religious zealotry is just who he is. He's not just religious, he's like.. bizarre alternative-religious (his definition of "Catholic" is not most people's definition of "Catholic"), and he carries his religious views with an extreme casual certainty. It's hard to discuss religion or philosophy with him, since he simply uses different definitions for everything and acts like you're silly for using the definitions most people use. That he's been using whatever wiggle room the technology allows to promote religious messages doesn't surprise me.
That said, I don't think he's trying to cover for MtGox. He honestly thought they were going to resolve their issues and reopen, and he ended up losing a *lot* of money with them.
EDIT: I talked with him today and asked about the e-mail thing. Apparently, at one point there was an agreement for MtGox to advertise Eligius in exchange for priority transaction processing (although, according to Luke-Jr, MtGox didn't fully uphold their end of the agreement). If there was a problem sending the transactions to Eligius, MtGox's code would send Luke-Jr an e-mail notification.

You've misunderstood the news. The MtGox thing is completely different from the DDoS thing. The causes are not the same.
The problem with MtGox is they incorrectly assumed they could predict transaction IDs at generation time. They can't. A transaction ID is only permanent once it's confirmed on the blockchain; in the meantime, it's unpredictable. MtGox was storing their predicted transaction IDs in their records for crossreferencing purposes. But when the confirmed transaction ID ended up being different from MtGox's predicted transaction ID, the crossreferencing failed, and MtGox incorrectly assumed that the transaction didn't happen. The solution: don't rely on unconfirmed transaction IDs; base your lookups on the signed transaction details instead. That's what other exchanges do.
The DDoS thing is different. The issue here is that the exchanges are suddenly being flooded with busywork, as if the bitcoin network became much much larger overnight. It's like if your little WordPress site landed on the front page of Reddit, and your site is now down because it can't handle the traffic. That isn't the result of a bug, it's just a matter of requests coming in faster than you're currently set up to process them. The exchanges can deal with this by adding more servers, making their code more efficient, etc. Just normal growth stuff.

The target of the bounce was $589.45, and it just barely passed that. It's about to head back down to test that low again.

I've never really bought anything with bitcoin before, but this interface shows how much Bitcoin still needs to improve before it's ready for mass adoption.
Here's how the interface *should* work (and it's technically possible for it to work this way):
1. Click on the "bitcoin" payment option.
2. Browser (or extension) pops up a dialog window containing your chosen security image, a message saying that such-and-such site is requesting payment of x amount of bitcoins, and a password field.
3. Type your wallet password into the field and click "Authorize Payment".
4. Done.

@_date: 2014-06-17 23:07:36
Good start. Of course, this is still an analogy. If you want to understand what's *really* going on, you have to get a bit more technical.
After a miner bundles up the transactions into a block, he then runs a math function on the data in that block. This particular math function is called a "hash function". It's similar to a checksum, if you've heard of those.
Basically, it's a function that takes a predefined field of bits (1s and 0s), and then runs through your data and "scrambles" those bits, based on the bits it encounters in the data. A slight difference in the data will result in a totally different hash output, and you can't predict how changing the data will affect the hash unless you run the hash function again and see.
A hash output can be interpreted as a number (which might be very very large). When a miner hashes a block, his goal is for that number to fall within a certain numeric range. That range is what's known as the hashing difficulty. For example, if the current difficulty is low, maybe numbers 0 through 10000 are acceptable. If the difficulty is higher, maybe only numbers 0 through 1000 are acceptable.
If the miner hashes his block and it doesn't produce a number in the acceptable range, he'll need to slightly modify the block and try again. To do this, he can simply increment a number that exists in an otherwise-unused area of the block data. He'll keep incrementing it and hashing until he finds a valid output (or until someone else does, and he has to start again with a fresh batch of transactions).

The price patterns aren't showing this yet. We're still just slowly consolidating. Last cycle, we had signs of new growth as far back as September 2013 (well before the Silk Road flash crash). We still haven't seen any such signs this cycle: even the May 2014 rise failed to rise above the second major bounce from the peak.
Today, we had something that looked like it could be the makings of an inverted head-and-shoulders within an inverted head-and-shoulders within a respectably-sized inverted head-and-shoulders, but the dip to $465 probably shattered that.
I'm a long-term bull, but I'm not seeing any real evidence of the beginnings of an upward trend reversal just yet. The market keeps trying, though.
EDIT: Then again, I notice that Bitstamp was the only major exchange that broke the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern today. It's still on the table for Bitfinex, BTC-e, and the Chinese exchanges. Such a pattern could easily bring us up to the mid $600s. But it would take a rise above $710 before I'd feel confident saying that the bull is back.

I know it's not a problem with the Bitcoin protocol. I'm a supporter of Bitcoin, and I think it's only a matter of time before cryptocurrencies replace traditional currencies. I'm NOT saying this is some kind of fundamental problem.
What I am saying is that we need to work on better interfaces for users. In the fiverr interface, paying with bitcoin is more complicated than paying with a credit card normally is. The technology makes it possible to build a workflow that's *less* complicated than paying with a credit card, with much better consumer protection than credit cards offer (since you aren't handing anyone your keys like you do with credit cards), without compromising the decentralized nature of the protocol, and users can even get a provable receipt.
So, I apologize if my previous comment came across as bashing. I'm looking at Bitcoin's potential, and I'm seeing that the services out there aren't fully meeting that potential yet.

In this situation, Satoshi denying that he's Dorian is the same as Dorian denying that he's Satoshi. Either they're both telling the truth or they're "both" lying.
Then again, if Dorian *is* Satoshi, he probably could have made a better case by admitting it as Dorian and denying it as Satoshi. Then it would seem as though they aren't the same person, and that Dorian is just trying to get attention.

Because it didn't cause people to want to buy more bitcoins. If anything, it's going to give people more reasons to sell their bitcoins (by purchasing things with them). Merchant adoption is great from the point of view of people who want to do thing with the bitcoins they have, but it's actually bad news for the price, at least in the near term.
Until something changes that makes a genuine difference in people's willingness to get into bitcoin or increase their holdings, the price will continue to be largely driven by speculative trading. The swings in the last several months have been fairly predictable (for those who know how what to look for), because they've been mainly driven by other speculators following the same logic.
I went all-in on bitcoin at about $400, just hours before Tuesday's big rise, not because I somehow foresaw the PayPal announcement, but because the technical indicators showed that the sellers had dried up and it was time for a retracement. I then sold most of it at $448 for similar reasons: high likelihood of reversal at the 61.8% retracement tag. I didn't even hear about the PayPal news until after these trades.

I don't think it's news-related. The technicals have been looking bearish, with a narrowing trading range, and all it was going to take was a move of a few dollars to trigger a natural jump to the next support/resistance level. I sold my bitcoins yesterday because I thought this was going to happen. I'm currently expecting some kind of bounce around $580ish, and I wouldn't be that surprised if it went all the way down to $471 before a real reversal upward. $552 will be another important level to watch.

return ++$foo; is equivalent to:
    $foo = $foo + 1;
    return $foo;
return $foo++; is equivalent to:
    $temp = $foo;
    $foo = $foo + 1;
    return $temp;
This is also true in C, C++, JavaScript, and lots of other languages. In general, ++$foo is *ever-so-itty-bitty* faster than $foo++, because it involves one fewer operation under the hood. However, compiled languages usually optimize this away so there's no difference, and in interpreted languages... you're never going to notice the difference anyway. I usually just stick with ++$foo because I find the operation more intuitive anyway.
By the way, in the typical for loop:
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; $i++)
    {
    }
Changing $i++ to ++$i produces the exact same result, since you aren't using or assigning the result to anything. I've noticed a lot of people *assume* there's a difference, because they know there's a difference between what $i++ and ++$i return. But the for loop above doesn't care about what the operation returns; the $i++ might as well be on a line of its own before the }.

Almost all cryptographic functions that provide 256-bit security are still fine even if a good quantum computer is made. Quantum computers can effectively halve the number of bits of security (via Grover's algorithm), thus turning a 256-bit search space into the equivalent of a 128-bit search space. 128 bits is the usual threshold for "effectively unbreakable", so it's still fine.
The main problem with quantum computers is not with hashing algorithms or ciphers, but with asymmetric algorithms (in practice, this means RSA and ECC). A good quantum computer will completely break these algorithms, no matter what your key sizes are. Basically all network security today depends on RSA or ECC being secure, so everyone is kind of in the same boat here. There's a ton of research going on to find alternatives to these algorithms, but the options aren't great yet.
Bitcoin uses ECC for its digital signatures, but the way Bitcoin uses it is actually more resistant to these attacks than most ECC applications are. This is because in Bitcoin, the "public key" of an address can be kept private until you decide to send the coins out of that address. This means the attacker would have a limited time window to crack the key: the time between when the transaction is generated and when it is solidly confirmed on the blockchain. As long as you never reuse an address once you've sent from it, the fact that an attacker with a quantum computer could now figure out your (old) private key no longer matters.

Every time we've had one of these huge rises in the past, it ended SUDDENLY and HARD. Whenever I see a post saying the price is showing "no signs of stopping", I just think, "Of course it isn't. It never does. It just suddenly goes from straight up to straight down."
Looking at the price from a technical trading perspective, we're quickly running out of upward targets. We had some solid targets around $4000, and that's about it. Any further upward movement would have to be from sheer emotion, and that isn't a good thing to stake a big investment on. People tend to get most excited right before the end. This is about where the big-money investors are looking to sell, not buy. And a drop back into the $1000s wouldn't be surprising in the least.

The 2017 summons included any Coinbase users who had at least $20k of transactions of any one type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 through 2015. Note that this isn't $20k of profit or holdings, it's the total **volume** of all transactions of that type: if you were to buy $10k of bitcoins, sell them, and buy them back again, that would count as $20k of purchases and $10k of sales.
[Here's an article]( about the ruling. This ruling was a one-off thing; something similar could happen in the future, possibly with different years and/or different criteria.
According to [Coinbase's FAQ,]( they send 1099s to anyone who has had a least 200 matched orders on Coinbase Pro, Prime, or Merchant in a single year, totaling at least $20k in total volume, whose gross proceeds are in excess of the state-specific threshold (which may be as low as $600 in some states).
The 200 + $20k thing is part of the standard federal reporting requirements for third-party payment network transactions, but I'm not sure where the state-specific threshold thing comes from. I'm not a tax expert, but it seems to me that any state-specific threshold should have nothing to do with *federal* reporting requirements. My reading of the [IRS guidelines]( ([2]( suggests that Coinbase ought to be sending 1099s regardless of that "gross proceeds" criterium.

Hardware wallets exist to help keep your bitcoins secure against malware. Most people's computers are open to all sorts of potential attacks that could put your bitcoins at risk if you're running a regular software wallet. A hardware wallet is relatively isolated from all of that, so there's less surface area for attacks. From the perspective of the bitcoin network and the IRS, a hardware wallet and a software wallet behave exactly the same.
As for volume, larger volumes mean that the IRS is more likely to notice you and are probably more likely to audit you. It also means you're putting more at risk if you try to cheat the system. And, personally, I wouldn't be comfortable doing a private off-the-record bitcoin purchase with a complete stranger for a large amount of money; I'd rather go with a company that I know is successfully transacting those kinds of volumes every day.

Legally, you have to pay your taxes either way. And I don't think people should try to avoid paying their taxes.
From a practical perspective, I think the whole "buy anonymously, sell on Coinbase" thing is B.S. that's going to get you in trouble. The IRS can see that you sold on Coinbase (and they'll probably have their eyes on fiat transfers from exchanges into bank accounts, etc.), and if they ever decide to audit you, you'll need to show them documentation of your purchase, including what you paid for the crypto. If you can't produce that documentation, then you're required to pay taxes as if you received those bitcoins as a gift, which means you'll be taxed as if the *entire amount you sold it for* was all taxable profit. That's a great way to screw yourself over financially, in addition to the premium you're paying. And if you try to falsify the documentation, you're just opening yourself up to even worse penalties.
Really, it's just easier and less financially risky to just be honest and pay taxes on what you earned.

The letter I got didn't say I owe them anything. It's the [standard letter]( they're sending to most Coinbase users, reminding you that you have to pay taxes on any profits you make with cryptocurrency. It's worded in a pretty obnoxious way that makes it sound like all cryptocurrency holders are inherently suspected of tax evasion, but it doesn't actually accuse you of anything or require any action. They use a different letter for that.
Personally, I didn't sell any crypto in 2018. I only bought bitcoins through Coinbase and transferred them to my personal wallet, and they've been sitting there ever since. I sold a lot in 2017 and paid taxes on that (around $80k in taxes), which was an absolute pain to do and has reinforced my decision to do a smaller number of larger purchases from now on.

This is the all-time high. Will it go higher? Who knows! But buying at or near the all-time high is the most extreme case of buying high you can possibly do.
If it drops from here to $2500, that would be "only" a 78% correction. That's a pretty normal percentage in Bitcoin land. The previous bubble (in 2013) had more than a 93% correction. All I'm saying is you'd better be mentally prepared for the possibility that the price drops below $1000 and takes years to recover. Because there's historical precedent for that.
I'll be waiting until people are afraid that Bitcoin is dead and that the price will never get this high again. That's when I'll be buying more. Right now is when people ought to be gradually selling off their holdings (or, you know, just holding).

I'm not saying it'll drop forever, but prices never make a straight line to their eventual destination. At some point, the price needs to "catch its breath", so to speak, by dropping, stabilizing, and setting up the next rise.

Every time, people say that this one is different, and every time it ends up making a &gt;70% correction.

You're right, I shouldn't have been a dick about it. It's just that this is the kind of time when people tend to make really stupid financial decisions that end up ruining their lives. It's always times like this, when the price has already risen far too much far too quickly for it to be sustainable, when people who have no experience begin buying more than they can afford to lose. Most people can't afford to lose $10k.
And then the drop happens. And it always happens without warning. It goes from straight up to straight down. And the suicide hotline posts start appearing, and people try to "buy the dip" only for it to dip lower and lower. And then the same kinds of people who buy at the all time high also tend to be the ones who sell at a &gt;70% retracement, which is exactly where experienced professional traders start looking to buy.
Most inexperienced people buy high and sell low. That's why professional traders can make a living.

Those crashes were big deals when they happened. It's just that there weren't as many people to experience the fear that Bitcoin was over.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:48:36
That relies on some assumptions:
1. That all bitcoins in existence are on the market for trading at once. In reality, there's probably a large percentage that is already *permanently* lost, let alone all the bitcoins people just aren't interested in trading at the moment.
2. That Bitcoin's value doesn't affect the U.S. dollar's value. In reality, if Bitcoin were to get that high, the buying power of other currencies would probably shrink accordingly.
Look at it this way: Imagine if Bitcoin were to approach 100% of the world's currency. Does that mean one bitcoin would be worth $5 trillion divided by 21 million? No, it would be more than that. The number of actively traded bitcoins would be much smaller (smaller divisor =&gt; larger result). But also, if nobody is using the U.S. dollar, then the value of the U.S. dollar will approach zero. What happens when the divisor approaches zero? The result approaches infinity.
That obviously doesn't mean that one bitcoin will be able to buy an infinite number of loaves of bread, just that all the U.S. dollars in the world wouldn't be enough to buy one loaf of bread. In this scenario, you really don't want to be caught still holding onto U.S. dollars.

An OTE zone is, by definition, a 61.8% - 78.6% retracement. Technical traders use OTE zones to decide when they're getting in/out. It's a type of pattern that's self-fulfilling: the more people who use it, the more reliable it becomes.
Prices like to ping-pong between OTE zones. That's the normal/natural state of things. When a price breaks past an OTE zone, that gives you a strong indicator of a breakout, even though the price hasn't *yet* hit a new high/low.

I say the block size limit should be increased from 1 megabyte to 1 mebibyte.
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:20:54
The coin limit and the block size limit are two completely different things. I haven't heard any serious calls to increase the coin limit, but there's been a heated debate around the block size limit.
The block size limit is a limit on how much new transaction data can get added to the blockchain every ~10 minutes. So, it's basically a limit on the rate at which transactions can be processed.
The arguments in favor of increasing the block size limit are pretty obvious: it would allow the network to handle more traffic at lower fees.
The arguments against it are less obvious, but still important: Larger blocks mean slower propagation of newly-mined blocks, which incentivizes centralization (something we don't want in Bitcoin). Basically, whenever two miners mine two competing blocks at nearly the same time (which happens quite often), the winner ends up being whomever can propagate their new block to other miners the quickest. When blocks are slow to propagate, those who are closer to the most miners end up with a significant advantage. So, bigger blocks means it's harder for people outside of China to compete, because so much mining power is already centralized in China.

I haven't read the details, but if they're talking about a system that works like Bitcoin for internal use... then it strikes me as an absurd idea. Overall, Bitcoin's blockchain is a pretty awful system in most ways. It's very inefficient, slow, resource-intensive, wasteful... The only reason Bitcoin uses it is because nobody has figured out any other way to achieve decentralization. Bitcoin's design explicitly sacrifices efficiency for decentralization.
If you aren't trying to achieve decentralization, then there's almost certainly a better way to do whatever you're trying to do, using industry standard technologies.
On the other hand, if by "blockchain" they just mean something like Git, then... okay, whatever. Referring to it as "blockchain technology" is clearly misleading people into thinking it has something to do with the buzz around cryptocurrencies, when it's really unrelated.

$6100 was a major price target. Right now, the price is likely to drop to around $5332 - $5513. If it goes below $5332 (which I personally think is a strong possibility, maybe after a brief consolidation), the next target will be the $3658 - $4197 range. That's a perfectly healthy target that would allow the upward trend to continue afterward (or at least a consolidation). However, if it gets below $3658, then that would be a sign that we've probably hit the peak of this bubble.

Simple AB=CD extension of the previous movement: we just saw the price rise from $1830 to $4980 ($3150 increase), then down to $2972, and then it started making new highs again. An equal increase ($3150) would take it to $6122. AB=CD patterns are pretty common, so you can expect that technical traders who are looking for the same thing will have set more sells there and avoided putting buys there, thus causing the price to lose its momentum once it hit the AB=CD target. Thus, good chance of it going down. As I mentioned in another comment, it's just kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy thing caused by technical traders.

Those are bread and butter signals, and nobody should be surprised by the recent price action if they're familiar with those signals.
Right now, my eye is on the OTE long zone off the January low. That range is about $198-$223. The most likely scenario at this point is that we bottom out somewhere in there to head back to $270-ish.

Most of those numbers come from looking at 61.8% to 78.6% retracements of the most significant recent highs/lows. These ranges (always with those specific percentages) are where lots of the big-money technical traders are usually looking for reversals to happen. When the price rises into one of these zones, traders start selling (or stop buying) because it's more likely to go down. When it drops into one of these zones, traders start buying (or stop selling) because it's more likely to go up. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is what makes them useful tools.
The numbers are specific because I just punched them into a calculator. Of course, the exact prices will differ from one exchange to another. I'm mainly looking at Bitstamp.

Sorry, but a double-top where the second peak is lower than the first is a classic bearish pattern.

This article is really misleading, to the point where I don't think the author knows what he's talking about. It makes it sound as if SecureRandom() is a native part of JavaScript, which it isn't. It's just a library somebody wrote *for* JavaScript. It's one of many such libraries people have written.
Modern JavaScript provides secure cryptographic functions via the window.crypto object. The vulnerability in the SecureRandom project is that they accidentally weren't using window.crypto, even though they intended to. Their code mistakenly thinks your browser doesn't support window.crypto even though it does. And instead of throwing some kind of error, SecureRandom decides to handle this situation by deliberately using the insecure Math.random() instead. Math.random() is insecure **by design** (it's meant for speed, not for anything security-related).
EDIT: It's also worth pointing out that this issue only affects Bitcoin wallets that used this particular JavaScript library. This would mainly be web-based wallets that work in a manner similar to blockchain.info, where the cryptographic keys are generated on your computer via a webpage's JavaScript code. (Disclaimer: I haven't checked whether blockchain.info in particular was affected.) It could also affect installed wallet apps, but only if they were coded using JavaScript. It does NOT affect Bitcoin Core, for example.

TA works mainly for one particular reason: most professional traders, especially ones trading lots of money (i.e., the "whales"), trade based on TA signals. It's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Nobody is right 100% of the time, and no algorithm is perfect. To make money trading, you're looking for models that have a historical accuracy in the neighborhood of 60%, and only taking those setups where the money made on a trade when the model succeeds is greater than the money lost on the trade when the model fails and you get stopped out. If you trade on 2-to-1 reward-to-risk setups with even just 50% accuracy, over the long run you'll make twice as much money as you lose. This method of risk management is what sets it apart from gambling, and it's how professional traders make a living on it.
When I mention target levels, I'm looking at things like OTE (Optimal Trade Entry/Exit) zones and common harmonic patterns like AB=CD. Those aren't matters of opinion; they have rigid definitions, and I'm just sharing what they say. The various indicators don't always agree with each other, but there are times when they converge to some clear levels, and that was the case with the $300 top.

And how exactly are you going to capture it, if the connection is HTTPS?
I mean, it would be nice for Bitstamp to do what you're saying and include the entire request in the HMAC to provide protection in the event that HTTPS fails to do its job, but.... this is kinda HTTPS's job. So, to call it a security bug is an exaggeration.
@_date: 2015-11-08 21:36:46
Testing is a step in the process. You don't launch big changes like this into production without first running it in a test environment for a while to make sure the code works properly and no unexpected problems arise. This is a very normal procedure in software development. Think of it like clinical trials in medicine. The fact that BIP 101 is now in testing means that it's making progress.

The attacker would need to know your secret API key for that to work. The HMAC includes the nonce, which I assume Bitstamp enforces (doesn't accept more than one request with the same nonce). So, although an attacker could modify the parameters, they wouldn't be able to sign a new nonce without your secret key.
EDIT: Regarding the nonce: After taking a second look at the API documentation, it looks like Bitstamp probably only keeps track of the highest nonce you've used, so you have to make sure you're always generating higher nonces each time (as opposed to, for example, using the output of a hash function as your nonce). Just an FYI.
EDIT 2: Also, it's really freaking important that you use HTTPS with certificate verification, rather than regular HTTP. If you try to use HTTP, or a proxy that requires the ability to decrypt your HTTPS traffic, then you are compromising your own security, and Bitstamp doesn't have an obligation to protect you from that.

[My comment from 19 days ago.](
Expect a bounce somewhere in the $227 - $243 range (USD). After that, we'll see, but I still think the $200 area is a realistic possibility.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:05:32
For the sake of argument... If Bitcoin ends up succeeding to the point where it's the main world currency, and the USD falls out of use, the USD's value may begin to approach zero. As it approaches zero, the exchange rate of pretty much anything would approach infinite USD. So, a bitcoin *could* end up being worth a trillion dollars... if the USD's value completely crumbles.

The recent consolidation period had a couple of nice triple bottoms, and the trading range was getting narrow. People who were paying attention were waiting for a breakout to happen, and there wasn't much interest in selling into those triple bottoms. So, once the breakout happened (which was just a game of chicken, not news-related), it didn't see much upward resistance. That's why it rose as quickly as it did.
The price is likely to follow an AB=CD pattern into around $275-ish, maybe a bit higher, but expect a ton of resistance between there and $300. Given that the January bottom was never seriously tested, I wouldn't be surprised if we topped out somewhere south of $300 and went back down to look for a bottom again.

Well, he didn't mine anything "many years ahead". He included a news headline in the very first block in order to prove that he didn't mine anything in advance.
He probably mined around a million bitcoins legitimately, back when there wasn't a lot of mining competition.
The "price for new mined" coins doesn't halve each year. Rather, the number of newly-minted bitcoins that are awarded for producing a block gets cut in half approximately every four years (this is based on the number of blocks that have been produced, not the actual time per se).

What was I wrong about? So far, it's been doing exactly what I said it would.
EDIT: Could someone please explain why I'm being voted down and is being voted up? My "prediction" (where all I did was point out where the TA traders/"whales" are looking to trade, based on well-established models) has been right so far, and I honestly believe that the current price action is a result of TA traders. From what I've seen, TA traders have been dominating the market in the absence of major news, and I'm just trying to give you guys a heads-up not to buy into a top or sell into a bottom.

I'm saying that the most likely scenario is that the price will rise to the $275-$300 range, top out there, and then fall again and eventually make its way down below $200. I would love it to just start rocketing up to the moon, but traders make money by watching for key levels, managing risk, and responding to change, not by wearing foam fingers.

AB=CD is a very common price pattern where the price moves sharply in one direction (up or down), then sharply moves the opposite direction partway, and then reverses again and moves an amount equal to the first movement (in price, not necessarily time). In other words, the change in price from point A to point B is equal to the change in price from point C to point D.
As with most technical analysis, the main reason the pattern exists and works is because traders expect the pattern to exist and work. When an AB=CD pattern appears to be emerging, lots of traders will set sell orders at the expected D price (and not significantly lower), which reduces the price resistance leading up to that point and increases the price resistance at that point, thus ending the movement right around where people are expecting.
Also, as with any pattern, it isn't 100%. But it does follow through more than 60% of the time, and that's enough to make profits on it over the long run (especially if you're setting your stop levels so that the amount you make when you're right is greater than the amount you lose when you're wrong).

If you ask me, this isn't security through obscurity at all. At least not any more than password-based encryption is security through obscurity. If the answer is based on some sort of memorized path or pattern in the data, then that's just a password in a different form.
Suppose the private key can be found by following a path starting from a particular spot. Let's even pretend we know what the first two spots are! At each point in the path, you have 8 directions you could go (including diagonals) for the next character. There are 49 additional characters to be found, so that's 8^49 different possibilities. That's about the same as a 22-character password with mixed case, numbers, and a grab from 33 different symbols/space. And that's even assuming we knew where it starts, which we don't.
I say pack up and go home. Unless he actually used a much weaker method than this, we're never going to find anything.

That was AttemptAtHumor's attempt at humor.
supernatendo's suggestion to use a safe deposit box + paper wallet is a good idea. By securely transferring the possession of the paper wallet, you're granting that person full access to the bitcoins associated with it (assuming they know how to use it).

You can buy a little now and buy a little more later. It's not like you have to go all-in at the absolute lowest point. Personally, I'm thinking it's going to slide a bit more before it's stable, but nobody really knows.
