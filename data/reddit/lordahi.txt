Yeah, definitely get that offline.
Super bad especially if you have an amount you’re not willing to lose.
I’d recommend generating a new wallet with a seed that has never touched the internet. Send a majority of your coins there. (Remember to first send a small amount so you know it works)
Paper works just as well if you don’t want metal.
If you choose to write it down on paper, this is a good read on preservation

Also, paper can be fine too if you give it the right conditions. (Multiple copies, use a passphrase, refresh your copy every year or so, stable environment)

Buy a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger) and generate a seed (it’s series of words). The seed is the most important part. It will recover your coins or virtually any hardware wallet if yours breaks. Thus, keeping the seed safe is crucial.

That’s fine. People go all out over which wallet is the best but as long as it’s off an exchange (and you control your own private keys). You’re good.

Assuming you’re getting a ledger from your other comment, there is an option in the ledger live app that will say “receive”. It will prompt you to plug in your device and follow the rest of the instructions. It will spit out a QR code or a public address for you to send to. I recommend sending a very small amount first to be extra sure your doing it right.

Stay away from anything brass, aluminum, bronze, gold, copper, silver if your goal is fire protection.

If it were me, I’d prefer to generate a seed on a device that’s never touched the internet. But as long as you understand the risks and your phone is indeed secure.

If you’re not trading, you don’t even really need a hardware wallet. (Unless you use it to generate your wallet initially). The convenience of the hardware wallet is for secure transactions but if your holding, you really only need the seed.
It goes without saying, electronics don’t last forever and they aren’t supposed to.
So ironically, the best way to hold offline is plain ole writing it down on a physical medium whether that be [paper]( or [metal](

Cryptosteel is the original design and let others use their design. (It also looks like they are introducing a new version shortly)
Billfodl took that design and manufactured their own with slightly different materials.
Take that as you will. It’s up to you one way or another :)
Jameson Lopp is fairly impartial and has comparison of not only these two but most of them:

That’s why you have a seed, independent from hardware. If you’re holding, I wouldn’t think you’d be messing it with it much.

It’s pretty difficult to remember unless you make a habit out of it (e.g. repeating it to yourself everyday
But I agree, a metal seed storage (Lopp has an excellent comparison of all of them) would be most future proof in terms of not only fire/water but your future (possibly forgetful) self.

On the [BIP39 Github]( under wordlists, a) smart selection of words, it states, “such way that it's enough to type the first four letters to unambiguously identify the word”.
