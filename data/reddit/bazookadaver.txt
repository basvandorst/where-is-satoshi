Can i possibly, maybe, if you want to, if you are up for it, if it is possible,  if you still have any, if the stars are aligned, if you feel the need, the need for tipping, if it's in the stars, the cards,  the realm of possibilities, if it isnt too much to ask, could you would you give me a tip?

People will use Paypal because it is established... Paypal will get their cut. You can talk all you want about open network and the reason Bitcoin is here, but the big dogs will always get their cut.

Still not sure it is the best direction,  but better than BTC.  This is especially true for newcomers.  Using bits feels a lot like visiting one of those foreign countries where you use 10,000 notes.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:06:09
I think your second point is key.  I find it almost better to write off what I spent on my bitcoins. Do I want it to grow? Of course,  but I am not counting on it and will be fine if it does not.

The tip isnt annoying... the reply tip confirmation and the private messages are.  I've said it before,  i wish they would make the reply really to the point without all the hyperlinks and also make an option on your changetip account to make all your tips private.

It is what it is... and what it is unknown. This is all uncharted territory, therefore 3 years of history does not tell you anything. It has a higher likelihood of deviating at some point than say stocks.
Im not saying we're headed for the worst or best... im saying we just have to wait and see.  
Someone who blogs about bitcoin and owns bitcoin is going to be biased.  The rationalizations that spin any negative info into positive is astounding in the bitcoin community. I see it all over this sub and most bitcoin blogs.
For those who are thinking of  investing, put in what you can stand to lose.  Expect to never see it again.  If it tanks... oh well.  If it makes money it is a plus.

I think it is bad not to tip at all and pay it forward.  If you come out ahead in the end, I guess it's ok.  
I think it all depends on how you got your tips.  If you are one of those that are asking for tips
 or doing things in disingenuous ways to get tips, that seems wrong imho.  
If you are tipped generously for providing good insight or content, then more power to you.  Especially if it is something you worked hard at.

I think there is room for all sizes of tips.  It all adds up and most importantly it shows someone you value their contribution to the diacussion, even a small one.  
The real problem is the confirmation reply and private message.  They need to be shorter.  They also need to make it so that you, as a sender, can check a box on changetip so that all your tips are treated private.  Also, allow people who get tips to silence the messages if they want.
