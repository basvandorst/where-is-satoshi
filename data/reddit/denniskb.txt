Wasn't meant to be funny. A little appreciation for OP's initiative and report. And hopefully a little help, too.

I think Ben Lawsky isn't getting the credit he deserves. He's one of the few officials who actually cared to learn about Bitcoin in order to make educated decisions. Everytime he appears somewhere he seems to have developed a better understanding of the matter at hand and a better grasp of Bitcoin community's needs. He also goes out of his way to make Bitcoin regulation an open dialog and democratic process.
If you haven't seen it, go watch ["Cryptocurrencies: The State of Play"]( - it really changed my view of him.
And remember, as Bitcoin adotion grows, its regulation becomes inevitable. Whom would you prefer to write the legislation? Ben Lawsky or people like Senator Kirkland or Professor Bitcorn..

Have you considered selling the client? I'd rather pay once for the whole program than for every single transaction. Just my 2c.

Don't worry, the recipients are rather tech savvy - otherwise I would've made them more verbose ;)
Feel free to suggest improvements though, esp.: can you recommend something better than [spendbitcoins.com](

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you too! I agree, but unfortunately I wouldn't have been able to mail out paper wallets in time for Christmas :( - hopefully next year :)
Just one question though: Isn't it a bit cumbersome to import the keys if someone doesn't have a webcam? Do you include a digital version along with the paper wallet or do you advise people to get a mobile client?
