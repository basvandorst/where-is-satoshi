Any transaction for that amount and I'm full on para. Let alone btc. Don't get jacked! Have someone at the spot before you get there. Scope-ing it out. Consider bringing a firearm. Yes record it, yes wait for confirmation. Maybe half now, and your friend who is the plant drops the rest when confirmed. Use your brain and be careful. Best of luck!

Now you're making me think. If the courts can *not* make them give up their private keys, unlike most asset seizing cases, it's about your perspective of coarse. Good for them, when they get out of prison, assuming btc is stronger then. Which, from my perspective, can *only* get stonger, also good for mass adoption. If the public, here in America at least, feels the scammers will get caught, the uncertainty will be abated a bit, and that is good for btc as a whole. A lot of Americans i talk to about btc really don't care. But that's okay, imo, it's not about (the) US. it's about the rest of the world that we don't even think about most of the day. (i do) . SO! They lose a chunk of their lives, and come out rich. Seems legit to me. Buyer beware..?

So the first paper wallets i printed.. I used my phone. 
Went to bitaddress.org, tapped 10000 times because the randomizer usually uses mouse movement, managed to browse around the mobile unfriendly site, set up multiple encrypted wallets, got my phone to find my buddies wifi printer, boom. How's that for convoluted security? 
I then wrote the passwords on the wallets, loaded em up with $10 each and went out drinking. Left them around town as tips, half of which have been claimed and moved to diff wallets. Still watching the unclaimed.

Be patient, let them ask questions, and just maybe they will be piqued enough to reach out and do research on their own.

By offline meaning a computer that has never been online. Say, an old laptop with the wifi gutted, and a fresh install. Known as air gapped. Then copy bitaddress.org (i like this one, simple quick user friendly) with a freshly formatted usb stick, to the fresh computer's browser. And don't use a wifi/ net enabled printer. The printer should also have never been online. Simple old school usb print only. Enjoy your encrypted paper wallets! Totally secure, give some to your friends and family, safe deposit box, with full trust.   Multiple geographical locations, in case of fire, theft.. They can't get your private keys without the password(s)!

Might be somewhere else here tl;dr, but I like bitaddress.org. DL a copy of the site and use it on an 'air gapped' computer.

Lots of people feel the same way. 'how can he show his face round here!?!' Funny enough, *it's the Internet*

Excellent! Some of those are pretty surprising. Argentina for one.. Wish i could read more español. And for their sake, thought btc would be taking off down there by now. Did you stop by Found it in the sidebar. Keep on keepin on! $1 @_date: 2014-11-19 17:58:45
Oh great, another crap bitcoin vid.. NOPE!  So wrong! This is one of the best I've seen. Quality production, great stories, how can you go wrong with that backdrop! Awesome! Thanks

Oh this again. Can we do it this time!? 
I thought I'd share, just something amusing. I'd read this post earlier, later on downloaded an android program that starts with b. I've been using an icon pack called Long Shadow, and what do i see in the b section, but a beautiful bitcoin symbol like the one you are describing. Too lazy to post an image rn, on mobile. (i am way more concerned about user base than another fork) glad to see it catching on in random places.

Be patient its not going anywhere. By over-heating over and over you are risking damage to the drive. I'd just pull the wallet.dat file from it and load it onto another computer in the future. Or better yet just pull the whole drive out and keep it in a safe place till you can put it into a working computer. Stop trying to synch and beating your head

These are my thoughts as well. Pick one of the myriad cases bitcoin makes, and get deep. I'd chose remittances/the un-banked and under-banked. My fav, as putting the $ wasted in transactions across 'borders', back into the pockets of the poor, trying to send USD (mostly, but any other fiat sent counts) back home, really appeals to me. There are countries whose GDP is all remittance. Think about that

With all the cryptohate flying around, i'd just like to know if they have *any* evidence linking daesholes to bitcoin. Anyone remember the news? I'm no journalist, but i seem to recall 'who, what, where, why, when and how' which was lost somewhere along the way

The total traffic volume is not going to change, that is dependent on how many people are using btc at any given point. More nodes gives the whole network better security. According to Andreas, at the MIT bitcoin convo, we are **over** secured right now. Not a bad thing, but don't worry about getting that node up today.. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:43:42
As if they weren't a big enough target already. Want to start a pool? How long before fB gets hacked.. I'm saying 3-4 months

Totally agree. But if we can't get our collective shit together the whole grand experiment is going to implode. Sorry, but I'm really pessimistic about this lately. I hear about amazing things happening in Africa, Venezuela, China.. But here in the states, and especially on this sub..total shitstorm. Personally i could care less if a transaction takes an hour, i trust the system. But a day? A week? My need to use btc to give the finger to the banks, is outweighed by the other party's need to have a transaction complete in timely manner. I can't spread the gospel, to the masses who don't really understand what it is, if they expect speed. One of the best ways to get em hooked (used to be) to get them to use it. But that's out the window now if they have to sit and wait and wait. Your average monkey doesn't know how the backbend of Visa works either. It just works. (I had been focusing on local merchants, vendors, and by proxy remittance. Lots of small business types around here sending money home. I'm no trader or bank type) 
Man, i haven't been on this sub in a bit. I have a hearty need to not be censored... And i just get all fired up, totally going to wreck my whole day! haha! Feels good to get this out, but i won't be replying. And thanks

@_date: 2015-03-17 01:15:19
Because free will. Not everyone would even want this. Choose a wallet that is focused on anonymity. Airbitz below is nicely polished. Anon focused, not perfect yet ofc.. Merchant dir is top notch. Or wait for darkwallet. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:25:09
You can not have one without the other. The currency is the incentive to keep hashing. The hashing secures the network and does the transactions. Take one away the other will fall.

Sure used to be instant. I was one of the naïve who thought btc could actually change something meaningful in this fucked up economy. Math and not people. But ofc people and politics got in the way anyway. This whole 'civil war' thang really makes me mad. Get it together smart coder type peeps! I really want to respect you again! /rant oh and thanks for the memories, i can eat only so much popcorn

Throwing my vote in for Airbitz. I personally just use coinbase, i know i know.., i don't really care to control my keys, or have any privacy.. But for those who *do* care; Airbitz is a pretty slick mobile wallet, with privacy in mind. I once tweeted them about their android permissions. [sold me](
