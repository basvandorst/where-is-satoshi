If you do not have large institutions, longterm, than bitcoin will not appreciate, because not having large institutions limits the total volume of wealth stored in the bitcoin economy.
If bitcoin will not appreciate, longterm, they're not analogous to precious metals.
If you are using bit coin because it's a means of exchange, then you don't care what speculators are hoping for. You simply wish the price wouldn't fluctuate, and a competitor might come to offer something more suited.

Without debt only the wealthy can finance new business ventures.
Your money, in an ideal world, represents your wealth relative to the totality of wealth. If the totality of wealth is expanding (new goods and services and people) then it's natural for the portion of the economy that someone who stores their wealth represents to become smaller.

That works for certain kinds of ideas, but it's no panacea. Also, crowd sourcing as an option vs crowd sourcing as a foundational necessity for the middle class entrepreneur are two different things.

If you don't have loans you don't have innovation, because your middle class can't compete. You need loans in a competitive economy.
Cryptocurrency is a relatively unique service right now, but that doesn't mean it will remain so. And if this service could be divorced from market speculation it would be a superior product.

If you have innovation you can not have a steady state economy. Consider the transistor, and how it expanded the sphere of goods and services.

I'll give that one some thought...
My first objection is that making your idea public would make it vulnerable. Copyright law is tricky, and I doubt anyone's gonna crowd source your lawyer fees.

It does... but gold is also quite a different thing.
However, if you were to try to run a large and rapidly expanding economy on gold, that would exert a different kind of pressure on the gold market. If the economy outgrows gold, which is worth a totality of a few trillion dollars, this would fundamentally change the nature of 'gold'.
I believe gold to be currently overvalued, given the unfavorable global economic climate, but if I were going to pick a store of value to dig up a thousand years from now, gold would be an excellent choice.
