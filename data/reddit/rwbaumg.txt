Needs more cowbell.

I'd have to look; as mentioned in my post I've only seen various posts (including the one you mentioned).
In truth, though, that type of red-flagging is exactly the point of KYC/AML rules, so I see no reason to doubt this is what's happening with any client/service that pools coins (eg. tumbling services, Wasabi, etc.) - very easy to spot, and no doubt flagging such TXs keeps exchangers on the IRS/government's good side.
Consider, if you use such a client/service/app but don't actually care about privacy, it should be a non-issue if an exchange asks for proof of funds etc., so why do you believe they're not doing exactly this type of red-flagging?
TL;DR - There is no such thing as easy privacy; if you rely on an app/client/service/stranger to anonymize your coins you should absolutely expect to be flagged when sending them to a KYC/AML compliant exchange. Even those that don't flag them today, likely will soon.

I've seen multiple posts and various stories, but don't have any links immediately available - it's strictly hearsay so far as I can tell.
The primary issue IMO is just how likely it is that this type of flagging is indeed taking place - any type of tumbling is very easy to spot on-chain, and far-too-easy a target for KYC/AML exchanges.
That's enough for me to take serious pause before relying on such techniques. Your paranoia/comfort-level may vary.

Which is why (apparently) most KYC exchanges now red-flag Wasabi coins..... I've seen posts from individuals claiming serious issues trying to deposit/withdraw/exchange coins sent from or through Wasabi, which if true, is really unfortunate (but not at all surprising).
IMHO it's best to simply avoid easy-button privacy solutions altogether and instead take the time to manually disassociate coins you want to stay private. Admittedly easier said than done, though....
EDIT: Worth reading

Fair enough. I'm not saying it's a shit wallet, only clarifying the limited usefulness in relying solely on something like coin-join to "anonymize" coins - when combined with other tools and methods it can still be useful, but only with full understanding of the limitations/implications involved. 
The people that have had/will have problems are those that seem to think using a specific client/service/etc. is all they need to do.... ��
In any case, running your own node is a good idea regardless IMHO.

Nice �� - glad to see someone do a little research before speaking for once. /s
Google is your friend (next time, maybe)... check your "facts". The F8 was just delivered, the P1 less than a year old.

The P1 is over 3mil, and when you buy a lot of cars from Ferrari you get bumped to the head of the line. You don't know what your talking about... your disbelief is meaningless, as are your "facts". 
Not that I give a shit... having a teenager try to talk shit to me on the internet is not something I have time for. Enjoy mute.

You couldn't be more wrong (and not subjectively either) - 911 Turbos are all AWD, along with almost every other modern supercar on the market - without it, your typical driver wouldn't be able to handle the power off the line and there would be a lot more crashes (most crashes involving supercars seem to result from untrained drivers losing control off the line, because the car is either RWD or had stability control disabled).
Maybe you got confused because the Porsche *engine* is rear-mounted for weight distribution (although not as far back as a lot of other supercars). I've had the pleasure of some awesome cars over the last several years- the Porsche 911 Turbo S, Lamborghini Aventador, Ferrari F8, McLaren P1 and McLaren 570S most recently-- most are just for fun, and the ONLY car I would call a daily driver is the Porsche 911; AWD, great suspension, a lot of extra space (by comparison) plus some of the best handling make it a very easy car to live with, while still having enough power to consistently beat most other supercars on the track (drag is another story).
TL;DR - Lambos are about the least practical of the supercars IMHO; I'll take an R8+ over a Huracan anyday. I wish I knew why so many BTC holders have such a fixation on them - probably because most got lucky while not having a lot of "common" sense... it takes brains to spend wisely, and smart money doesn't buy a f*****g Huracan with it.... ��

Sounds like a lot of shitcoins (no offense)....
Bitcoin ($BTC) first, always..... 
If you were hoping for another coin to repeat Bitcoin's growth and give anywhere close to the same ROI, well forget about it (at least with current alts). Unless and until something new pops up, with some significant and unique property to greatly improve on usability (or do something a lot better/more efficient, or maybe something else amazing and in high demand which Bitcoin can't for some reason be used for), the chances of that are essentially zero. You're much better off just putting it all (or at least 75%) in Bitcoin (you know, the *real* Bitcoin OG, $BTC) IMO.
On a bit of a side note, I think it's unfortunate that such a focus seems to have been placed on "privacy coins" like Dash, Zcash, BitcoinZ, Zcoin, Monero, etc.) - I fail to see the utility, nor the mass appeal considering the typical stance on privacy with things like social media and IoT - noone really cares, and those that do care are already able to achieve near-perfect anonymity with Bitcoin and a little reading - we don't need new coins to add *more* anonymity, which makes adoption more difficult and the asset more likely to be heavily regulated and associated with "bad things™" (oh no! ��). There are definatley valid use-cases and always will be a market for those features and/or alts that do it well, but no "privacy coin" can succeed on that alone, and will never come close to replacing Bitcoin IMHO.

And BTW, all the P1s are registered. Here it is, probably my favorite car yet:
Maybe I'll post more pictures sometime, for now though this is waay off topic. I was only trying to share my 0.02 regarding drivablity (since I have actual experience and not just couch-warrior "know-it-all" delusions). 
The Porsche wins hands-down as a daily driver. The rest are really only fun on the track, and tracks can be hard to get time on (at least where I am). The Porsche is still comfy and fun even on long road trips - the others not so much (although for pure comfort the Rolls still takes the cake).
