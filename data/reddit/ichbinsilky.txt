Day 1 highlights are currenlty available
Also, I'm assuming that this is (most likely) a metaphor for bitcoin devs, cryptologists, etc. that will be at the forum.

Well if a currency such as the dollar is debased for some reason, if that happens we have bigger problems to worry about than trying to figure out which currency we need to use to pay our taxes .

You could always run a full node and help speed up the network....
edit: also greenaddress is shit, use 
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:32:08
use two factor (2FA)
Multi sig wallets are meant for groups of people, so the group can authorize a transaction. It's not really any more or less secure than 2FA.

It's more about the people behind bitcoin, the startup companies, and some of the challenges they faced. It also talks about Silk Road and Wikileaks and how the government wanted to regulate it. Just a good documentary for people who don't really understand it.

*"You will need 10,000 SJCX in your address to recieve any/full rewards for this test"*.
Also, just so everyone understands you are volunteering your free computer storage and bandwidth to do this... It's essentially P2P storage, and storj.io developers are ~~paying you~~ rewarding you to utilize your storage for alpha/beta testing. It uses a blockchain to achieve consensus of file location and integrity (very cool). It sounds like the final product will allow you to rent out unused space on your computer for profit too, which will prob be in SCJX too no doubt.

This is correct, and it's a gaping security hole if someone steals your phone, which is what that security is there for in the first place.

It's not about what you can do with it, it's about what developers can create. You don't know what can be done with it because a developer hasn't made it yet. It's a dev kit, not a full product yet.

It's aimed at software developers to create apps/services that leverage blockchain technology.

It's not a BTC miner in the traditional sense.
You know when the Occulus Rift first came out, no games supported VR? Now that it's been out awhile, a lot of games have VR support, but it's still a niche market.
This device is like that. Except it's geared towards ctyptocurrecy microtransactions that are fractions of a cent. Currently you must pay a fee worth more than the microtrasaction itself (unless you run your own full node), in order for your payment to get written to the blockchain. This device aims to fix that problem by creating a mining pool that will focus solely on getting microtransactions into the blockchain for free.
Once apps and services are available for it, people will be able to pay for/use these apps and services that utilize microtransactions which the developer will profit directly from the app or service they make.
1) Developer makes app/service with microtransaction
2) 21inc miners verify microtransaction
2) developer profits from their app/service

That game is addictive as hell though. I bought the auto-tapper because i'm lazy and mining btc should not involve physcial labor.

Yea cuz they're building an exaflop capable super computer in the next 10-15 years...which will probably be quantum based, and I'll be damned if the Chinese aren't building one too, just because we are.

Sooo you're saying there's a chance...
Never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket no matter how "secure" they are.

While this seems like a good idea in theory, this would actually slow down the network. When a client has to keep disconnecting and reconnecting to establish connections with peers to download individual parts of the blockchain, it actually slows the overall downloading and distribution process. It is more effecient to distribute from peers with 100% of the data.
Edit: also when the core client connects to the network, it downloads the same entire data set from everyone on the network. This inherently already makes it more effecient than having the data spread across multiple peers. Adding peers that don't have all the data, does not help speed up the process.

That's fine, as long as all of your millions are not in breadwallet alone. 
It's like using multiple banks to store your money. You wouldn't put all your millions in 1 bank because they can't insure it all if something happens.
Even if you don't have 1 million dollars, if you just own a lot of bitcoin, it's probably a good idea to spread it out over multiple wallets. Until you feel comfortable to the point if someone hacked one of your wallets, then you would still be OK if you lost all the money in that wallet.

He was supposed to send ~$10, accidently sent ~$100. Tried to get money back and couldn't.
So (a real person) sent (guy who made the mistake) ~$90 which was the difference he was trying to get back.
