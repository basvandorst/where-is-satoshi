Yeshua got his arse properly whooped last time around and buggered off. He has a shitty great track record for "a saviour". 
Bitcoin is merely a non-government run way of P2P payment. For many, the attraction is that it is decentralised. If a government was to run Bitcoin and dictate ppls transactions, then ppl would source another means. Governments and banks own the majority of the gold whilst ppl own a tiny fraction of it. Gold and silver provide a means of global currency.....although things digital simply make life easier in many ways. A One World Government might just as well control and advocate that ppl trot gold and silver around with them for payment. A One World Government would have the lion's share of the gold/silver and could control the mines. I gather you prefer Central Bank fiat issuance as it is localised to various countries. Gold is the prime One World Government means of money.

This IS the elephant in the room. Bitcoin is ultimately not decentralised due to the fact the Chinese govt can take over the network today. James D'Angelo spoke about this subject. Screw the Rose coloured glasses and naïve "not profitable" bullshit that has zero relevance.
The situation is abysmal. There are govts and ppl on this planet who can build their own mining gear and overwhelm the network for pocket change. Yet ppl mention it would be unprofitable! (IDIOTS)....some ppl surely ONLY want to bring the network down....and they have billions to play with ..(if not more)
I think there should be an escape mechanism from an attack where perhaps only trusted pools and miners about the planet are accepted and if they don't perform they are given the boot. Meanwhile, we try to sort out various ways of going about Bitcoin.

If the CIA, Rothchilds or other are building their own miners with a few piddley billions of pocket change....they could easily dominate bitcoin mining at their will.

If we don't have an escape mechanism, this is a payment system waiting to get chomped beyond all recognition.
A potential solution?.....If we had an escape valve system where we could switch to one thousand separate semi-trusted miners across continents with systems in place to make sure they can be ejected for 'bitcoin friendly' players, I would feel a lot more comfortable with the current situation.

Second reply: Here in Sydney there are two machines. The Lamassu ATM at Black Star Pastry gets about 1-2 customers per day according to the owner. A newer Robocoin ATM situated off Pitt Street in central Sydney currently gets very few customers according to the staff in the "Bitcoin accepting" cafe opposite the machine. (the cafe (Cellinis) does not currently accept bitcoin due to a problem with the payment system and possible staff training issues).

BELIEVERS in Bitcoin don't trust Mark Karpeles with their bitcoins. It is anti-Bitcoin to trust Mark Karpeles with your bitcoins. Eric Voorhees went against his own sound advice and trusted a Mark Karpeles with 550BTC. Eric Voorhees and others are at fault for the considerable damage done to the bitcoin ecosystem. I now fear one hacker has huge amounts of bitcoin and it has decreased my faith in bitcoin. I consider it anti-Bitcoin to trust a centralised third party like Coinbase, Vircurex, Bitstamp, BTC-e or Mt.Gox with excess coins not being traded. Many people with bitcoins are pro trusting centralised third parties as banks and thus anti-Bitcoin. They are assisting to f*k-up the Bitcoin ecosystem nicely. I wish there was a massive choir of anti-Bitcoin turned pro-Bitcoin people post the Mt.Gox collapse, teaching people about the decentralised nature of Bitcoin and how one needs to control exclusive access to their bitcoins in order to "own them".

Sure, this an aspect of Bitcoin and reason why Bitcoin may have a very limited usage within societies. People want third parties to look after their 'monies'. This is what "banked" people especially in developed countries are used to and trust.

It can surely come down to an individuals experience. What real benefits does Bitcoin give to people in countries like America, Canada, England or Australia?.

Gold is struggling at best to be considered money these days. It collects dust rather acts as money (I have some, and it collects dust). Where can one go to pay anything with gold, not that I'm interested anyway! ...especially if we consider how long it has been around. Barrick Gold has a market cap alone worth more than 3 times the bitcoin market cap. One freaking company. It is amusing that some gold and silver bugs feel threatened by the bitcoin market. People want to make near instantaneous transactions longer than the length of their arms. In this case, gold and silver do not exist. Bitcoin compares with other digital utilities more closely, like Visa and PayPal. Not gold.

Yes, I've used the Lamassu at Black Star Pastry in Sydney twice. Both times there were problems getting the machine to work. Slightly annoying, but I am an enthusiast. Luckily, the staff were able to sort out the issues. I made a vid on the second visit. Notice the machine is open in the final shots ;-)
Thanks for you honest experience with the machine.
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:08:17
Have you not worked out why Lamassu machines are not already operating across the US. Non-compliance with KYC/AML requirements can land operators potential jail time. The Robocoin machines have optional KYC/AML features that the operators of the machines decide on whether to implement or not. The 'Bitcoiniac' operators of 'the first bitcoin ATM' at Waves Cafe in Canada implemented the KYC/AML functions at first and then decided not to. It is the decision of Bitcoiniacs. They are the ones whom take the risk vs Canadian regulation and authorities. 
"Some ATMs (I think Robocoin ones) may use webcam to get user photos, scan ID documents or even taking finger prints. The lamassu vending machines don't give those rich functions, and sometimes the data collecting function becomes crazy, e.g. for the recently installed lamassu ATM in Albuquerque - the owner of the cigar bar was sitting near the machine and collecting personal data of people who bought bitcoins using his laptop." - source: 
The Robocoin machines are potentially a replacement for walking into a bank and signing up for an account, if the operator chooses to do so. They are more than a regular ATM.

@_date: 2014-08-18 10:12:56
Boring facts: If the operator enables full KYC measures on this machine, you will be setting up an account (at the machine rather than at a traditional bank branch). The machine is really a 'branch' in this case, as the Robocoin company have termed it. Part of the process when setting up an account is to scan the hand four times in order for the machine to capture your palm vein pattern sufficiently. The next time you use the machine it will require you scan your palm once.
The operator of the machine may decide not to enable the KYC and AML features, thus the same machine may not require a palm scan at all. The machine is capable of anon transactions. It is up to the operator of the machine. The Robocoin machine run by Bitcoiniacs at Waves Coffee in Canada has been giving ppl anon transactions.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcon "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.

* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. 
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.
* BTCpoint          2W KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* Coinplug           2W AML feature (not known if optional) KYC? (Korean) 
* Diamond Circle  2W Visa/MC not cash. KYC (via bank CCs) and AML variances for operators.
* Genesis1          2W Optional fingerprint reader/gov ID &amp; bank card reader for operators. Lite/Doge too
* Robocoin          2W Optional ID scan/palm vein scan/camera &amp; optional AML feature for operators. 
Various brands offer operators options for setting up their machine.

I think I may have read Satoshi's comments on this…but can't completely recall. Will look it back up.
Some B&amp;M retailers are super busy. Transactions need to happen quickly within tens of seconds. 30 seconds is a life time.
If bad actors can scam people, they will. IMO, the world has plenty of people looking to scam others. From coffees to Corvettes. CC fraudsters will migrate to BTC (you know what I mean hopefully).
I'm concerned that "double-spend wallets" will be developed in order to try and assist double spends. Don't ask me how they would theoretically work. They could possibly use services like "BitUndo" or a potential other.
If I am retailer, I want payment for good and services near instantly if possible. I don't want to have to trust that people will pay me.

No - if you want to perform P2P transactions on the Bitcoin network, GreenAddress is not stopping you at all. Nothing changed for you at all! For ppl who want others to receive payments in a hurry without being concerned over a double spend, GreenAddress provides that service. I've spent bits at a pub and cafe, luckily they have not expected me to wait for a confirmation on the bitcoin network. I don't want to wait around. I will use my Visa card instead or cashola.  I do want to walk away knowing that the cafe or pub knows my payment is a sure thing (ya Visa!). Pple trying to use BitUndo (for example) or another similar project may rip retailers off in the future. Double spend wallets may be created! Retailers could lose trust in the network if bad actors do this, and the planet has plenty of ripoff artists. I don't expect or want retailers to trust me.

The machine does not probe and I don't particularly love it kid.
The palm scan is new biometric to many people, so it freaks some people out. I decided to actually read up a little on the Robocoin machines and realised that many people on this forum don't understand that Robocoin gives operators an option to comply with KYC/AML measures. The operators decide, not Robocoin.
Personally, I don't care what the operators decide to do. I want them to stay out of jail. The Robocoin machines save one from being present for identification in a bank branch against photo ID. All of this is an option. A biometric is required it proves you are physically present, just as you are in a bank branch.
I give my detail to companies like Coinjar &amp; Mt.Gox. It is all optional on my behalf.

Shrem was public about having lawyers to keep him out of jail. OMG……this is amateur time. You are involved in Bitcoin and have a profile…..any specs of dirt and you will be hung, drawn and quartered.

Bitcoin is not about trusting centralised third parties with ones bitcoins. Those whom trusted Mark Karpeles and others with the keys to bitcoins they considered theirs have done a lot of damage to the bitcoin ecosystem. I now value the bitcoin ecosystem less because hackers have perhaps, 100,000s of bitcoins and that is f*ked. I purchase items from my own wallet the way purchases are supposed to be done. Exchanges can hold up outgoing funds. That is screwed when some websites want prompt bitcoin payment. You people make me dislike bitcoin even more.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:37:20
Nerds and people within the bitcoin spectrum whom have been around longer are not in the position newer people to the market are. This is where the alt coins can be marketed to newcomers with a more user friendly product whilst bitcoin is out of touch with it's "expensive coins" and clunky nerdy "millibitcoin" etc speak. Zero point zero zero anyone?. I'm not going to have this failure to move and adapt be a problem for me. Some well marketed alt coins are going to become huge. The wider public does not give a shit about how corrupt fed reserve banks are. They want a user friendly non "drug" &amp; "money laundered" currencies. Charlie Shrem was on a news report lately that regarded Dorian Nakamoto. He delivered a throw away comment whilst the news service dragged bitcoin and "money laundering" out once again via Shrem's current house arrest. All for a throw away comment!!!. I don't blame people for turning their backs on bitcoin and it's "money laundering" and "drugs" ties. The Charlie Shrem arrest assisted to galvanise my mothers view on bitcoin. Nuff said….

Ya, the machine operators need to be on the ball. The Robocoin machine in Sydney required a follow up maintenance of some sort I was told. It worked fine when I used it though. Also, I used a Lamassu machine twice, but both times, the cafe staff had to meddle with the machine to get it to operate. Another operator of a Lamassu machine in Nimbin Australia claims to have had similar issues. The operator needs to be on the ball to make sure the machine is running properly. The tech is still young, IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:34:35
The dogecoin community have put out a serious amount of spam and I now know why companies do this. It is annoying but it works. The moon aspect is a very serious part of the dogecoin scene, although the moon thing is part of all cryptos. The tipping works also. People were doing this more in the earlier days of bitcoin. Nothing new, but it damn well works.
Andreas has pretty much just characterised the almost entire Bitcoin community as "serious". The dogecoin has some serious investors within it too already. The market cap is nothing to sneeze at. In the early days of bitcoin, people did not even know if it was going to worth anything.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:21:54
Good. Exchanges are not banks and trusting centralised third parties with bitcoins is anti-Bitcoin. Those who trusted Mark Karpeles (Mt.Gox) have done a lot of damage to Bitcoin.

Due to financial regulations and the company wanting to know the customer like banks, transactions may be limited via say Coinjar.com.
At Coinjar.com you can deposit into their NAB account by taking cash to the bank branch. You can link a bank account at Coinjar.com. It is simply one option among other options like localbitcoins.
There is another small online company based in Newtown Sydney that acts as a channel.
The ANX bitcoin exchange is another option, and you can link to Australian banks I believe. This exchange is is possibly one of the more legit exchanges on the planet and I'm thinking of migrating to it myself.

I'm aware for sure….but I'm sceptical regarding a community that is possibly non-savvy with marketing compared with others. Marketing and image is huge. I want Bitcoin to dominate but have my doubts…..I'm a little put off by the people like Shrem and Karpeles. Shrem came out and stated he thought Mt.Gox was going to survive in the last week or so before the final collapse. Insider trading took place I believe (not necessarily Shrem but others…). I'm also annoyed that so many people kept so many coin at Mt.Gox when Bitcoin is about having your own wallet and taking charge of your coins. They trusted Mark Karpeles instead and greatly damaged the ecosystem, IMO. Now a rich hacker probably has most of them and is less likely to contribute in a way the others would have, I'd think??. The bitcoin community failed itself in many ways….my enthusiasm for bitcoin has decreased I must admit. It is almost like it deserves to be dethroned due to so many bad actors and BS. The alleged correspondences and charges against Shrem look downright damning, yet the community backs him up and he is featured at a conference lately (Texas). Bitcoin has the spotlight and foul players will be hung, drawn and quartered unlike banksters…and further...in Shrem's case, cavity searched, because they may have every reason to believe he may possible have drugs on him. That is the reality….I struggle at times with the mentality of the Bitcoin community.

The vein pattern of your hand is not something your leave behind like a finger print, nor can be it caught on camera like your photo. It is more anonymous. Governments have no use for vein scans. Govts use fingerprints and photos. Scans prove you are the same person using the machine. Banks rely on the bank teller being able to compare your face to an ID.
If privacy is an issue for you, don't use bitcoin ATMs that require finger prints, vein scans (palm or finger) or IDs. Obviously you don't or did not use use services such as Mt.Gox, Coinbase, Coinjar or Bitstamp. There are further considerations regarding net traceability……...

Sure, risk a few at an exchange to trade but don't leave coins with other parties. Fancy telling noobs to trust centralised third parties with YOUR coins. F*k this crap. Bring on more exchange please. Mt.Gox was not a big enough lesson!!!!

Here is a video: 
It is located at Michael Cargill's Central Texas Gun Works. It has been there since March, 2014.
CoinVault requires various measure for compliance with Fincen. Thus they have enabled the machines KYC features. This would include govt issued ID, a palm vein scan (banks compare you to photo ID) and a mobile phone number.
If you don't use services that require your ID. Don't make the road trip.

Vein scans, whether palm or finger are more anon than fingerprints. Govts typically use finger prints and photo ID. These are more trackable via cameras and fingerprints you leave behind. You don't leave vein scans anywhere. Vein scans are of no use beyond proving you are the right person at the machine. I doubt medical research has a great need for more vein data, FWIW. I've used the palm scan and it is not a big deal. It is a new concept for ppl though. My finger prints would be of potential use to the Govt regarding other potential things.
The operator of the Robocoin machine decides whether or not to implement the KYC/AML measures. Robocoin does not decide. It may come down to what the operator feels comfortable with. They no doubt want to stay out of jail at the end of the day. The Robocoin machine actually potentially (if operator sets KYC/AML features) replaces the need for a bricks and mortar bank where you are compared with your photo ID by another human being. That is why the company now refers to them as branches.

You continue to be an assumptive fool. Stupid assumptive humans. What fools we are. What makes you think I give a toss whether you use the machine or not? I don't give a fuck. Ppl can do what ever they damn well want. I just inform ppl of a few facts because ppl can be ignorant. Confusing I know!!!!!!!
Coinbase requires ID. Mt.Gox required ID. Bitstamp requires ID. Coinjar requires ID. Why do you think they require ppls ID. Are they all doing it because they want to hassle ppl?
Why did Coinbase put you through the hassle of showing them ID. They want to know who you are. If they see what is regarded as suspicious activity in any way. Suspicious movements of wealth they should be by law, obliged to report your activities to the authorities. Coinbase may potentially hand all of your details and trade information to the government.
If operators enable the KYC features their Robocoin branches, the machine can perform the same basic function of both a traditional bank ATM and bank branch. That is why they termed the machines 'branches' and NOT ATMs. It is a new concept and I'm over explaining it. It is too confusing for some ppl.

Robocoin supplies machines with the KYC/AML features. The operators whom purchase the machines decide on whether to implement the features, not Robocoin. Bitcoiniacs (the operators) in Canada implemented the features at Waves Cafe and then decided not to. It is their call, not Robocoin's. Non-compliance with KYC/AML regulations can surely potentially land operators in jail.
*The Robocoin machines are potentially a replacement for walking into a bank and signing up for an account, if the operator chooses to do so. They are more than a regular ATM.

Ya, This is one of the reasons why I like Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin has it's roots partly in an emergence from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.
Bitcoin is about giving people the choice to be involved in a functional currency that bypasses centralised banks and does deflate away ones personal savings.
The alt coin pumpers are surely mainly motivated by "to the moon" aspect. Dogecoin has plenty of reference to the moon, and mooncoin obviously has moon in the name. The spamming pumpers want a repeat of the Bitcoin's rise. Late adopters looking for some action. I'm no early adopter myself, FWIW.
Bitcoin provides more of an environment to learn beyond self interest in pumping alt coins to get rich quick.

So much to say on this but won't.
It is an invention (Bitcoin)….and thus deserves admiration and support. Born in part out of the 2008 GFC…………………people within alt coin communities could not give a toss these things.
Bitcoin is has been the battering ram, and the people involved have put up with a lot of lies, politics, risks and joys…to get bitcoin to where it is. This remains the case today. In the early days, some people discarded their bitcoins as they viewed them as near enough to worthless. Bitcoin was not just about the money, and for many, bitcoin is still not just about the money.
The subsequent alt coins are definitely much more about the money. Late comers, hungry and some times aggressively marketing for a bitcoin style ride. How can we pump this coin - give away promotions/charitable attention drawing antics etc.

Silver does not exist for near instantaneous transactions longer than ones arm. People generally don't want to use silver to transact, as per the market place. Silver bullion collects dust. Silver exists as the monetary saviour on a planet thrown back to the stone-age where somehow, everyone has forgotten about the now non-existent internet but has not forgotten the monetary worthiness of silver. Bitcoin v Visa and PayPal is where it is at, not silver.

**Operators decide on utilising Robocoin's KYC compliance options, not Robocoin**
Example here: 
The Robocoin machine operator in Singapore is going to decide whether to implement the palm scan option pending further KYC updates from Monetary Authority of Singapore (Singapore's Central bank).
'User activity is recorded and can be provably isolated to every transaction. Operators can set special limits for trusted users if they choose, revoke the ability to use the kiosk entirely, and analyze quantities and frequency at any time. Operators who enable KYC compliance join every other operator who has enabled KYC compliance to create a massively interconnected user network where a user who registered at a California kiosk can do business from a different kiosk operator in New York. User transaction activity applies to each operator’s compliance settings in this group to prevent nefarious buying behavior across operator boundaries. Operators who do not enable KYC compliance manage and operate their own segregated non-identified user network and do not join this special global group.' - Source:

My 2cents: Only touch on the block chain and mining. Bitcoin is decentralised, thus significant amounts of coins should be kept in the control of the true "owner". Do not have significant amounts of bitcoins in the control of centralised third parties like Coinbase or Mt.Gox. Don't bamboozle people about all the different types of wallets. Stick to explaining one. Bitcoin is VERY young, thus volatile due to market size vs news and trading slosh. Real world: Tomcar has saved upwards of $50,000 on fees (NO SPECULATION INVOLVED).

Thanks, I've known about Bitcoin since 2010 but prob 09'. I never got vested until 2013 even though I loved the idea all along and want people to have another option to protect their wealth. Things have changed and the sense of risk has dropped off incredibly from my perspective (even though I agree totally with Gavin Andresen - Bitcoin is an experiment + I consider a major hashing (over 51% attack) easily possibly still, with possible dire consequences).
*I've only been on reddit for a few months though. I don't have a long history on reddit as you may have. I don't like spammed subreddits though, in whatever form (even when I'm vested in what is being spammed/upvoted with multiple accounts/'tip to vest' etc , Lol)

I'm not an entrepreneur in the space. Are you 100% sure Coinbase employees need not concern themselves with KYC or AML concerns. 
I'm quite sure Coinbase has lawyers looking into their situation and advising them from a legal perspective. Coinbase will also perhaps want to maintain a solid footing with various banks. If Coinbase is looked upon as a means of "money laundering" banks will potentially drop any association with them. I'm very sure Coinbase has not implemented measures just to screw around their clientele

If they are being over compliant, that is the people who run the machines choice. The palm scan is an option on the machine (I think).
My first entry into bitcoin meant going through Localbitcoins and, then driving to and trusting a stranger with my money outside his work place (a tech guy). Bank accounts take a while to set-up, but they smack of legality and compliance. People generally want prepared to comply with the govts laws. Bitcoin already has a bad rep for some people. SR and the Shrem arrest are things people may know about and have made the obvious association. These people will not be using the machine either, at least not the ones I've talked to.

FWIW, here is some data I put together regarding Bitcoin "ATMs". It is pretty much up to date and covers pretty much all of the companies with actual product that I've come across. It deals with KYC &amp; AML in brief.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.

* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)

* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.

*I actually don't give a much of f*ck about money (It is a crazy situation Lol). I don't even know how much I get paid an hour strangely enough (just roughly). A work colleague was talking about a recent and significant pay rise, and I have not been aware. 
I was probably aware of BTC in 2009 but def 2010 (I think 09). I stood on the sidelines and watched with interest, non-judgemental unlike many precious metal enthusiasts who did not like Bitcoin. I've have precious metals and am interested in alternatives to the banking monopolies. Crossing over from the precious metals "stacker" community, one has already perhaps been through the hoops of looking protect ones self from the whims of bankers. Knowing "more" came after study and deciding to protect myself as best as I can. It is just a basic interest in life. I'm not sure what "more" refers to exactly, but I congratulate people for studying beyond what school trotted out for them, I congratulate those who jumped into bitcoin earlier than I did at much higher risk and I congratulate the tech crowd for building things up to the point where non-tech people like me are more able to become part of the ecosystem.  If any alt coin was to go to the moon in the fashion bitcoin has, you will have your fair share of assholes with superiority complexes. That is life.

I've used a Lamassu machine a couple of times. It is great, although both times, the attendants at the shop had to fiddle with it to get it operating properly. That is why, in my video below, you will see the Lamassu machine open at the end. 
I support all of these risk taking manufacturers. These are early days.
I produced a video of one occasion to assist others with location and use of the machine before they get to it. Here is my video:

Robocoin machines don't require your identity. Despite the Robocoin CEO Jordan apparently digging himself and Robocoin a grave the facts remain the same regarding the Robocoin machine and other machines capable of requiring IDs.
The operator of a Robocoin machine may decide not to enable the KYC and AML features, thus the same machine may not require a palm scan at all. The machine is capable of anon transactions. It is up to the operator of the machine. The Robocoin machine run by Bitcoiniacs at Waves Coffee in Canada has been giving ppl anon transactions. It is the same basic story for other "ATMs" on the market.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.

I'm not an entrepreneur, but I appreciate that these start up companies have high costs to cover as they research, develop, forge pathways and take high risks. All power to them. The market will decide and other companies will follow if the tech is successful. Prices will then come down. These are early days for companies in the space. I wish them well. They have more guts than I do.

Ya great comment. Bitcoin sorely lacks a smooth dialled in voice for MSM. Andreas is great but this arena is not his field of expertise, and Andreas has other work to do.
Bitcoin also needs multiple paid devs working full-time 24/7 on bitcoin and monitoring the network 24/7. Fixing bugs from 18 months ago is no longer good enough.

Don't be confused…some manufacturers provide options, thus **the operator decides**. The operator sets up their machine. Local regulations may influence their set-up choice. Potential jail time may influence their choice.
Various companies require ID. Photo ID is arguably the most invasive ID. A persons presence can be detected by cameras via facial recognition. Humans ID each other via sight more than anything else.
Points to consider:
*  Lamassu offers document scan features. The operator decides.
*  BTCpoint machines offer KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators.
*  No ID required. Bitcoiniac run two-way Robocoin machine, Vancouver, Canada.
*  No ID required. SatoshiPoint run two-way Robocoin machine, Shoreditch, London.
*  ID required. Mt Gox, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Circle, Coinjar, Bitstamp, the list goes on….
*  No ID required. Lamassu one-way machine. Blackstar Pastry, Sydney.
*  ID required. ABA tech run two-way Robocoin machine, Pitt St, Sydney.
*  Genesis Coin two-way machines have an optional fingerprint reader for operators.
*  Diamond Circle machines offer KYC and AML variances for operators to set.

If a hacker has got hold of the Mt.Gox bitcoins, that hacker has huge power to disrupt the markets in the future. If so, those who kept bitcoins in the trust of Mark Karpeles are to blame for this the potential of a future mess via the hacker/s. Trusting centralised third parties like Bitcurex, Coinbase, BTC-e or Mt.Gox with storage of ones bitcoins is anti-Bitcoin.

"I'm saying don't push for replace-by-free to make the less secure decentralized solution even less secure." - I've used zero conf at b&amp;m venues (cafe &amp; pub). I'm happy for retailers to do what they feel comfortable with. They are the ones whom potentially may get scammed. I think the driver here is going to come from the crims at the end of the day. They are the ones who are potentially going make retailers demand more secure payments. Just as they are the ones that make companies use armoured vehicles and various security measures for their stores. I'm supportive of GreenAddress and others. I see people with multiple credit cards and all sorts. I have multiple BTC wallets.

"That being said, cryptocurrency as a space is very unpredictable so it wouldn’t surprise me at all if dogecoin beats the odds and overcomes these challenges in some weird, wacky way. It’s in the community’s hands, and they’re certainly passionate about seeing it reach the moon, as am I.” - Jackson Palmer

First up: Good on you! I hope you explained that they might get next to zero sales via Bitcoin due to the tiny community using bitcoin to purchase goods. Some businesses stop accepting Bitcoin due to lack of sales (does it cost them now they are set up - any monthly bitcoin related fees to cover?).

I read up on Robocoin machines and I've used one (the spread on the ABA run Robocoin machine here in Sydney is too large for my liking). Most of my Bitcoins are purchased via Coinjar.com. I've also read up on Lamassu machines and I've used one. The Robocoin machines are harder for ppl to understand. Thus I provide facts to assist, even though some ppl resent this. I will use other "ATMs" when I get the opportunity. I don't particularly care for any brand. If ppl don't understand the other brands, I will seek to assist.

There is zero hindsight involved!. Mt.Gox IS a third party. Mt.Gox was not the first exchange to close and surely won't be the last. Eric Voorhees lost 550 coins at Mt.Gox. He did not need hindsight. He already knew that he should not store coins there as he did, but we humans don't always practice what we preach. The last thing Mt.Gox ever was, was a bank.
Mt.Gox is NOT Bitcoin. Mt.Gox could have just as easily taken off with your 'Magic the Gathering trading cards' for example, or the USD you sent them for purchase of the cards. You would logically blame the MTG playing cards or USD as you have done Bitcoin. Ironically, MTG trading cards and USD don't even have their roots in taking away the risk involved with third parties.

Yes, it is great to see more machines about. I've used the Lamassu machine here in Sydney a couple of times (when operating it is great) Yet another reason to visit Italy!
Certain companies want ID. Mt. Gox did. Coinbase, BitPay, Coinjar, Bitstamp…etc. I gather you dislike these companies with complete contempt. Robocoin offers a product that is more anon than these companies due to the fact the machine can require no ID. 
Operators decide when it comes to the Robocoin machine. The Robocoin machine operated by Bitcoiniacs in Canada runs with no palm vein pattern scan or photos required. KYC is entirely optional believe it or not. Idealy, sure..no KYC/AML regulations, but in reality…operators have to make the choice. Your beef is with the operators.

Nope, Bitcoin is not Mt.Gox and Mt.Gox is not Bitcoin. In a free market, fools can keep coins on a website like Mt.Gox (Magic the Gathering……). If they lose coins they trusted someone else to look after, that is their problem. Treating Mt.Gox like some sort of banks is insane. The same goes for other exchanges and services.
Bitcoin has nothing to do with trusting others with ones coins. Bitcoin is decentralised for a reason…..trust no one.

Hi, I live in Sydney. BitPOS is possibly a solution. Coinjar may have some ideas too. I've i was you, I'd contact Coinjar.
See my vids and contact people who actually utilise Bitcoin in Australia as system of payment. (find their websites and phone numbers). 
The Old Fitzroy Hotel, Sydney.
 (Black Star Cafe sell coffees at the counter for bitcoins.
* I went to Cellinis Cafe and asked to pay in bitcoin yesterday. They said their bitcoin payment system was down. It has been down for weeks. One of the assistants explained that the system needed to log on or something and it took too much time so they scrapped the idea for the moment until they get things sorted. Busy cafe's can't waste time with payment systems. Seconds matter. The guy was realistic and knows bitcoin is young and that they are having teething problems. I hope they get things sorted with the Bitcoin payment network. I will support their cafe some more if they do.
You need to be on a bitcoin business map. If I went to Melb I would support your bar….it may happen, if I get back to Melb again.
Check out some of the businesses in Melb. Spend bitcoin with them to experience the ecosystem yourself (if you have not already).

Why would banks scan your palm or take your finger print? A banks 'biometric' is your face against photo ID. Interfacing with actual people face to face has its advantages, depending on how you look at it. Bitcoin ATM manufacturing companies don't include biometric measures such as finger print or palm scans for nothing. Various operators may wish to utilise them. Non-compliance with KYC/AML regulations can potentially lead to jail time.

"as for the information you finally provided i appreciate it. it seems to me that they should team up with coinbase and provide streamlined service for people like myself who'd already been vetted."
Coinbase dose not dispense cash to ppl on the side of a street. Bitcoin "ATMs" do. It is a different service. Coinbase knows the money is going the client because the bank already done the KYC stuff to set an account up at their end. The bank then limits ppls transactions and monitors the account. Banks also have the benefit of being able to compare the client against photo ID (a human biometric). Photo ID would have to be the most invasive form of ID by far. You can be identified at a distance and these days, cameras can track you on the streets, airports and almost anywhere. People are generally accustomed to this means of identification. Car number plates provide a similar means of ID.

I don't see why Coinbase can't be framed by nefarious entities for enabling terrorist financing. Dirty deeds happen on this planet.
Even on other levels, can these ppl access their coins if Coinbase's HQ was to have a fire and destroy their computers. When will ppl have access to bitcoins under Coinbases control. Coinbase had a recent event where a customer was seemingly able to withdraw Bitcoins that were not that customers to withdraw. Coinbase were damn lucky that this person drew their attention to the exploit.
Anyway, like Mt.Gox whom ppl deemed as trustworthy, it won't be my problem, should something occur. I'm not into trusting third parties. Mt.Gox showed that many have a different attitude.
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:15:14
Sure, Bitcoin is not perfect, and neither is using a third party signature, IMO. I have wallets that don't require third party to sign. I actually want a wallet that provides the businesses I spend bitcoin with, assurance that they have they will receive bits near instantly with no anxieties.
I suspect crims are yet organise double-spend specific wallet tech and BitUndo like structure to try to cheat people. This may turn various retailers off. I just don't know, at this stage. I may be completely off base. I wary of bullish people here who want to gloss over potential problems.

We need to change to mBTC or uBTC but we need names that roll of the tounge in an instant. I was thinking "m"bits or "u"bits???…but still….
People can't afford bitcoins. The early adopters are out of touch nerds in certain regards, IMO. Bitcoin needs to be very friendly, and sound snappy and simple.

Bitcoin "ATM" manufacturers like BTCpoint, Robocoin and Genesis offer machines to operators that are capable of taking various biometrics or not! Do you realise these machines are capable of providing an anonymous service whilst companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinjar, Circle etc don't provide this at all? Whether you are or not. This is the reality of the world you live in.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:11:46

Robocoin machines bypass entering a bank and setting up an account. In both cases (bank or Robocoin machine) setting up the account for the first time, takes longer than subsequent everyday transactions.

Many of us enjoy computers but have no clue what a bit or byte actually is in data terms. I don't know. Is there a difference? If someone was to approach me on the street, and ask me to put the correct amount of zeros in front of a milli, micro or nano I'd completely struggle, and have to hope I'm correct. I would have more chance than most though, I'm sure. It is the sort of question you could put on a well televised game show to stump most the audience. A conflict between "Bits" and bits and bytes would be relegated to computer tech folk only (an extremely tiny minority of the worlds population).

I did not get excited a couple of weeks ago when GHash dropped back to 36% because I'm not that naive. Sure enough, GHash bounced back with more hashing power than ever.

Operators buy the machines. Operators are the ones putting their asses on the legal line. Bitcoin "ATM" operators are surely not interested in your finger print, palm vein pattern or photo ID (they don't want your breast milk either). Bitcoin "ATM" manufacturers are also not interested. You know this because they give the operators options when it comes to 'Know Your Customer' features. Their machines can run without the need for IDs! Coinbase and Kraken don't offer an anonymous option! Governments set the tone here via KYC and AML laws.

I made this vid to assist people. It features the Electrum wallet which is relatively easy to use. 
Have two Electrum wallets if you have a few coins. One for storage and one for general spending/trading/tipping etc. It is more secure to have a couple, as hackers will have a harder time access your coins.
Experiment with your wallet. For example: What if you lose your phone or your computer crashes completely. Experiment with backing up and reloading your wallet. Once you have done this, you will have more confidence and realise you can be anywhere on the planet where there is internet and be able to load up your wallet and access your coins.
If you have significant amounts of coins then get a paper wallet (see fit tutorials by James D'Angelo). Paper wallets are not such a big deal and the funds can be easily scanned back into wallets like GreenAddress on your phone.
GreenAddress provides '2 factor authentificiation' (2FA). This is a promising wallet. In the future, companies like Circle (with insurance) will provide another alternatives for people, who don't trust themselves to keep passwords and 'seeds' or backup wallets. But for now, spend some time learning about wallets. Bitcoin is all about you having access to your coins without trusting a third party to provide you with access to your coins.
Ask yourself, what happens if there are fire at Coinbase HQ. Will I still have access to my coins….or what if the American Govt comes up with a reason for Coinbase to halt it's operations for what ever reason.
Rule one: Have YOUR own wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:57:16
I think it is about time, that those whom trusted a centralised third party with bitcoins they consider theirs, start educating others on the dangers of storing bitcoins with centralised third parties.

**The Robocoin palm scan is optional (see link)**. It depends on the operator of the machine. Robocoin simply gives the operator a biometric option. The operator decides and it will depend on what country and the potential KYC/AML regs:  Governments oversee KYC/AML regulations. Banks use photo ID and have the benefit of the face to face encounter. If not, they restrict, as per their ATMs with their transactions limits. Robocoin machines bypass entering a bank and setting up an account. In both cases (bank or Robocoin machine) setting up the account for the first time, takes longer than subsequent everyday transactions.

Exactly. With your own wallet, you have control, rather than Mark Karpeles or Coinbase.
Coinbase is not a bank for bits either.
Here is vid I made to assist with an Electrum wallet: 
If you have lots of wealth, look at paper wallet options and other options. Dare I say it, when Circle comes online, if you really want a third party to look after your coins, they could be it. GreenAddress is another promising wallet and service. It also ensure merchants you can't double spend.

Various brands offer operators options for setting up their machine.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:41:35
This machine runs anon. The machine (NOT in this case surely) potentially can be set up in such a way that it replaces a physical bricks and mortar bank branch. If you want to create an account with a bank you walk on in there and they use the most ubiquitous biometric used by humans. They compare you against govt issued photo ID. Setting up an account at a traditional bank takes time and effort the first time. The transactions thereafter are much smoother because the initial KYC has been performed.
The operator of this machine no probably requires that you perform KYC also. Initially, it will take some time to set up (maybe 10-20 min or so).
From memory, having used one here in Sydney, it required a scan of my govt issued drivers licence, 5 scans of the vein pattern of my hand as a biometric (BTW, vein patterns are not left behind like finger prints and cameras on the street etc can surely ID faces these days, govts don't utilise vein patterns as an ID biometric), the machine takes a facial photo and a mobile phone number is required. Once the initial KYC is done, the subsequent visits to the machine require the palm vein scan only and your PIN number.
The machine here in Sydney has a spread that is a little too much for my liking. The operator of the machine pointed out that the machine is capable of providing fiat cash quickly or bitcoin quickly compared to online alternatives (although blah blah blah).
If you want to be anonymous, the machine is capable of that, but it requires that the operator set it up that way as Bitcoiniacs have done in Canada. Companies such as Mt.Gox (did), Coinbase, BitPay, Coinjar, Bitstamp, BitX, Circle and so on want to know who you are. They want to see your ID. KYC

Is it fair, to point to the difference in price at one point in time?
One of the things about various spot prices is that they change in relation to each other throughout the day. I've encountered this problem when trading with friends. One phone will be on one spot and one phone will be on another. I received $100 AUD and they received around $127 AUD worth of bitcoin due to the differing spots. I know that case is a little extreme but it happened a while back (partially to with the Mt.Gox crash I think too, but anyway - it is just to make a bit of a point). Some people were risking it a Mt.Gox because they wanted the Mt.Gox cash out price. The spot price vary from place to place. The percentage difference between Coinjar's spot and the ABA run ATMs spot price will surely increase and decrease during the day. I would expect ATMs to have higher fees over websites due to costs involved. Of course, if they are going to charge exorbitant rates, customers will ultimately decide if the business is viable.  
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:05:55
So the magic Mt.Gox bitcoin bank trusted by the hoards is a trusted toilet bowl. I think I might check out the toilet bowels at other "trusted" centralised third parties.
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:40:36
Mt.Gox is a centralised third party - just don't store bitcoins there!.
Credit cards are also a liability like Mt.Gox (both awful to store monies/BTC etc). I don't keep much money in my credit card account, thus not much can be stolen. Bitcoin has given us the ability to store our coins and not be reliant on centralised third parties whom really take absolute ownership of the coins when in their possession. It's all about the private keys to the coins.
I have purchased items via the bitcoin network with other parties I've researched and placed a certain amount of confidence in. It is a risk though!. Businesses can go bust and I could be left empty handed. The potential transaction loss won't be the end of the world. If I was buying a car, I would do it face to face. Not over the internet. At the moment, I personally, don't use my Visa card if I can use bitcoins instead. For many people, Visa may provide a level of protection that suits their preferences over bitcoin transactions. I'm confident companies and the tech will become use friendly enough for consumers whom want the Visa back-up arrangements. 
**I use the BTC-e exchange which could close any moment now (I don't use it to store coins and take an obvious risk with what I have there).
I don't trust BTC-e a great deal but like the exchange!.

He claims he sold half. He obviously wants a decentralised Bitcoin. GHash crossed that line. His choice. I'm sure it was not a happy experience for him. You accuse him of fear mongering by exaggerating yourself. Ironic. I was thinking of selling off quite a few too. I'm not sticking around if GHash or another centralised institute controls Bitcoin. Many people interested in 'decentralisation' will surely eventually move on. Will mainstream people care for decentralisation? I don't care.

Photo ID is by far the most intrusive biometric (my govt certainly has mine, and other govts have it too). I am trackable by cameras on streets, airports and much more. Bitpay, Coinbase, Coinjar (which I use), Mt Gox (when operating), Bitstamp and more use this most intrusive of biometrics. 
The second most trackable biometric would be finger prints. These are useful particularly when it comes to crime, due to the fact they can be left at the scene. Govt's utilise finger print data in law enforcement. Some bitcoin ATMs provide the option of acquiring finger print (operators usually decide).
The bitcoin community might huff about palm vein patterns but it is barely useful (beyond KYC blah) when compared with photo ID in particular. Finger prints come in at a distant No 2 spot for intrusiveness.
If people are not uptight about the biometric of photo ID first and foremost, then I would have a hard time taking them seriously when it comes to concerns about other less intrusive biometrics like finger prints or vein patterns.

Biometrics: Ones photo is by far the most personal. Ppl are generally tracked by governments via their photo. Banks use this biometric. The next is the finger prints you leave behind (law enforcement). Govts are not stupid. Palm vein patterns scans are generally not used by govts and don't get left behind. Various Bitcoin ATMs take various biometrics. Photos, fingerprints and palm vein pattern scans. I think ppl focus on the later because they are least familiar with this form of biometric.

The operator has taken a step to comply with AML regulations - "The only "compliance" feature I've turned on so far is a maximum transaction limit of $500 USD."
The machine has no way of detecting if the same human is making transaction after transaction. Operators walk the walk. The manufacturers like Lamassu and Robocoin have forms that operators fill out. It assures all KYC/AML risk factors sit with operators rather than them. As per the list, most machines don't require KYC. The operator enables it if they choose to.
I doubt this operator supported or supports Mt Gox, BitPay, Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, Bitstamp and Coinjar etc who require/d ID for KYC measures as per this quote - "I like the idea of anonymity and I don't want to have to keep records of my customers' identities and monitor their private transactions."

r/bitcoin is spammed by one coin among hundreds…and it is not Flappycoin or Shibecoin.
Reddcoin tipping was banned at r/dogecoin. r/dogecoin would not tolerate the spamming level r/bitcoin receives from r/dogecoin. I have dogecoins. I realise the marketing/spamming and 'tip to vest' tipping is aggressive stuff. It works but I don't appreciate it here.
There is no shortage of threads at r/dogecoin that are derogatory towards people who have bitcoins. I've not read threads on r/dogecoin that focus on the banking system! I think Palmer encouraged the negativity towards people whom hold bitcoins. Everyone has their nemesis!

Gavin's early adoption was his choice. I'm sure he has a lot of wealth now, but he still deserves payment if he is working on Bitcoin.

I know, Lol. The whole psychology of trying to enforce that purchasing power does not matter when 1 doge = 1 doge contrasts with the real aim of dogecoin and going to the moon (more purchasing power). Dress currency how you will. I understand the mentality of later adopters, but the attack on the people who have bitcoins sucks, IMO. Bitcoin is a pioneering battering ram that gets enough grief from every other angle. 
“I think there was a lot of negativity and a lot of angst in the bitcoin community,” Palmer said.
Sure, but what about the years of positivity that has paved the way for coins like dogecoin to even exist. Bitcoin has been in the spot light of attacks for years now. It has forged a path and now other coins have been created. Jackson does not know many of the majority of people whom have bitcoins. I don't appreciate his negativity towards others, whom are just being themselves. No superficial facade.

FYI: The process you mention is required if the operator of the machine makes use of the optional KYC/AML functions on the Robocoin machine. The machine is referred to as a 'branch' rather than an ATM because it is capable of replacing the KYC that bank branches also performs when one makes an account in person at the branch. We are not used to ATMs being able to perform this. "The first Bitcoin ATM" at Waves Coffee in Canada is a Robocoin manufactured machine operated by Bitcoiniacs. Bitcoiniacs operated the machine initially with the KYC/AML functions turned on but later opted to turn them off making transactions pretty much anonymous. Robocoin does not make the call. The operators of the machine make the KYC/AML decisions, not Robocoin.
Vein scans can be taken of ones finger or in the case of Robocoin machines, the palm is used. Governments generally keep biometric records of photos and finger prints. Here in the Australia, the Govt has a record of my eye also due to my visit to a jail. Generally, finger prints and photos are useful to govts because cameras and humans can compare us to the photos. Finger prints are obviously useful as they can be left behind when we touch things. Vein patterns are not left behind, nor are they visible to humans or general surveillance cameras.
If anything I've mentioned here is incorrect, feel free to correct me. I realise some ppl on this forum hate the boring facts.

I can't tell if the machine requires a vein scan just by looking at it. It is an optional feature, the operator decides whether to implement or not.
The main biometric ID used by humans and governments is facial recognition. Banks rely on this biometric when you present at a branch. Governments will often use fingerprints too. These two forms of ID are the most invasive. Facial recognition is by far the most invasive. Facial recognition is obtained via cameras in many places these days (even some retailers surely by now).  We leave fingerprints behind (at the scene). Vein patterns are generally not trackable and governments generally have no interest in them. There is a difference.

Merchants are accepting bitcoin, what they do with it is their business. Some hold all or a percentage of it. Some convert the lot to their local govt fiat. Merchants can accept bitccoin from around the planet. If it is not bitcoin, what is it? Are you suggesting that a guy in Kenya who just got payed in bitcoin and then makes a purchase via Newegg for a laptop (to be shipped to Kenya) just payed Newegg in Kenyan Shillings (or M-Pesa!).  
Merchants can benefit from lower fees via the Bitcoin payment network and a lack of charge backs. Some merchants are offering discounts to ppl whom use the bitcoin payment network. It is a process that takes time and support. The network has to begin somewhere so it is not always going to be cheaper than established payment systems. You would have it not exist at all. In that case I would support another currency with more utility. You can hold your fiat, others don't want to.

Even Eric Voorhees kept 550 bitcoins 'sitting at Mt.Gox' against his own advice. Mt.Gox is a prime example of people using an exchange as a bank (a magic bank!!).

The charities within the bitcoin are numerous, and extend into Africa now on a couple of fronts. Personally, I have not been part of the charitable side within Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. I've donated a lot of time, effort and well over $15,000 AUD to my own projects that hopefully exist to benefit the greater public. I've also supported the locating and subsidies of various NGOs in the past. There is a time for everything….and I have my own finances to keep in mind which are not that great. I will be giving away an old computer to crippled acquaintance in the coming week or so.
Anyway, ….I noticed the doge bite and seeming disrespect. It has been the first time I've resented an alt coin culture. When I came across the dev saying "elitists" I wondered whether the dev had anything to do with the doge bite. Anyway, such is life……..respect is a bit old fashioned…especially when money is involved. All the best :-)

A) Instant confirmation: how is that possible without risking double spending?
There is a risk of double spending: it's all about shifting the trust, you don't have to trust the user won't do double spending anymore, you move the trust to the third party, so us and not the user.
Keep in mind that if we ever cheat it is immediately detectable in mempool and we are done, no more GreenAddress.

Ya, the people who get all bent up over a few percentage points and what that means to their own precious personal wealth situation are doing no one a favour, IMHO. For bitcoin to grow, the ecosystem needs to grow. Companies need to cover costs and make profits. That is how they survive to provide services. I am willing to sacrifice a little wealth to bolster the bitcoin network that gives back to me. An example in my situation, was my mobile phone purchase. The company Millenius did not have the cheapest deal, but it was pretty close anyway, so i supported them. They also had good reviews so….a deal was made and I supported a company supporting the bitcoin payment network.

Bitcoin is at the forefront of development in many ways. It takes the good news and plenty of bad news too. Many clever tech based people are involved as well as many clever investors whom were smart enough to see potential earlier than others. These people took much higher financial risks than what people are currently taking in 2013-2014. Noobs may resent them, but that is life. Slag them, call them elitist and so forth. They may even search for alternative coins to provide "moon" if that is what people are looking for. I've done this.
All cryptocurrencies are elitist to a degree. It takes a certain amount of knowledge and technology to "own" and utilise them. Some people will benefit should purchasing power of the crypto currency arise. It goes to peoples heads, mine included if "da moon" occurs. I regard this as a human aspect. I'm not going to claim that I'm higher than thou. People get wealthy via various means, like having properties in the right area at the right time etc. If all of the cryptocurrencies took a massive ride up in the next few weeks as bitcoin has at times in the past, many people with  more than a couple of coins may well consider themselves, pretty clever for getting in early and finding that moon.

The price is subject to demand. The bitcoin supply is inflating by around 25 coins every 10 minutes. Bitcoin does not require participation from the Chinese. The bitcoin market cap is currently more than 3 times smaller than what whatsapp sold for recently. The price of bitcoins is just one area of interest. Developer Gavin Andresen correctly calls Bitcoin an experiment. The blockchain technology is decentralised. It is utilised by a tiny percentage of the worlds population. It is not commonly used. Do any of you family or friends use Bitcoin? Most of the world would not know it exists. People are really just beginning to build practical technologies on top of the blockchain structure.

Lol, I don't give a fuck about any particular Bitcoin ATM company (never did). Jordan Kelly of Robocoin has screwed some operators around to the point where I would not be surprised of the company folds. If Robocoin folds due to negligent behaviour, good fucking riddance. Let the free market call the shots.
Fact: Robocoin ATMs can run anon transactions and have never required peoples IDs unless the operators utilise the functions. This is seemingly changing for US operators.
Fact: Governments generally utilise the biometric of the face and finger prints first and foremost. These are the most intrusive biometrics you can hand over to authorities. Govts can track people via cameras placed here there and everywhere. Finger prints are something you may leave behind.
But hey, boring facts are really disliked around here by some.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.
* atm4coin         1W &amp; 2W Open source project..ongoing. Machine availability?
* Bit-Wallet         1W &amp; 2W No KYC functions.
* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. POS functionality including staff tips feature.
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.
* BTCpoint          2W KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* Coinoutlet         2W KYC/AML options (operators decide) ID scan if required. Accepts altcoins if configured. Online shopping module.
* Coinplug           2W AML feature (not known if optional) KYC? (Korean) 
* Diamond Circle  2W Visa/MC not cash. KYC (via bank CCs) and AML variances for operators.
* Dogevertise ATM 2W Bitcoin, Lite &amp; Doge too. No KYC functions.
* Genesis1          2W Optional fingerprint reader/gov ID &amp; bank card reader for operators. Lite/Doge too
* Localbitcoins ATM 2W Nil KYC features.
* Robocoin          2W Optional ID scan/palm vein scan/camera &amp; optional AML feature for operators.

Mark Karpeles is a nice guy according to Charlie Shrem.
Charlie Shrem seems like a nice enough guy and even gave people confidence in Mt.Gox. Ross Ulbricht is a nice guy according to his mum. No matter what one thinks of the laws, people take risks. Profits are to be made. Tons of people risked it at the wobbly Mt.Gox in pursuit of Mt.Gox's higher cash out prices for their bitcoins. Collapses, money laundering and drug dealing. Great stuff - but bad press.

Coinbase is NOT a bank for bitcoins. Personal wallets like the Bitcoin-QT wallet are central to Bitcoin. The Electrum wallet is another place to start. There are more options communing. Cold storage should be done for large amounts of coins. Storing your own bitcoins is the very basics. Please read up on Bitcoin. If you don't control access to the private keys of bitcoins you consider are yours, you don't really own them.

If ppl want to convert to cash then good on them. Cash must have more favourable characteristics for them.

I don't hate exchanges and other bitcoin service providers. How on Earth did you come to that conclusion? I use various companies for the services they provide. I don't trust them as a 'bank for bitcoins'. Why? - They are not banks for bitcoins. Bitcoin is decentralised and Satoshi Nakamoto provided a wallet system so people can manage their bitcoins. Doing the opposite and trusting centralised third parties as some sort of bank for bitcoins is not how Bitcoin was designed. People are used to banks though, so they want someone else to provide security for them. More goxings to come.

Mt.Gox proved that people are prepared to trust centralised third parties with custody their bitcoins (alarming amounts in some cases).

•Day Seven: first week transaction volume of $81,000 CAD exceeds first-month goal of $50,000.
•Day Eight: Robocoin exceeds $100,000 CAD transaction volume from 348 exchanges.
•Day 17: Robocoin breaks even for operators (fee revenue = operator hardware price)
•Day 29: $1,006,550 from 1,576 transactions

From my understanding, it means that you can't make multiple transactions in the same day that eclipse say $10,000 USD as in the case of Florida, where the a guy has been charged for money changing over that states limit. The feature can no doubt be turned off if not required. There is another BTC machine that uses a finger print, same deal. Some people seem to think these companies have gone to extra trouble just to cause potential users extra trouble. Perhaps they should forward improved machines that perform better yet still cover compliance issues. Why do you think it has taken so many years for BTC "ATMs" to be used in the US. A Lamassu BTC "ATM" representative was saying that at least one company had one of their machines but it is not in use. It has been sitting around since something like October 2013 whilst not being used. Compliance is the issue. Staying out of courts and jail is an issue for some people. Location on the planet is an issue vs local compliances.

One way machine. No cash out. I've used the Lamassu machine, both times it needed attendance to get it going before I could start. When going they are great. It does not have the same KYC/AML considerations that may have to be adhered to depending on ones location on the planet. Consideration that is beyond the comprehension of people who don't operate these machines and want to stay out of jail. 
"Some ATMs (I think Robocoin ones) may use webcam to get user photos, scan ID documents or even taking finger prints. The lamassu vending machines don't give those rich functions, and sometimes the data collecting function becomes crazy, e.g. for the recently installed lamassu ATM in Albuquerque - the owner of the cigar bar was sitting near the machine and collecting personal data of people who bought bitcoins using his laptop."
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:04:51
Palm or finger vein scans simply let the machine know that it has the same human being present at the machine. The Robocoin machine are now referred to as branches. At a typical brick and mortar bank branch, the teller can compare you to photo ID. Operators of Robocoin machines can turn the KYC/AML features on or off. They would do this depending on their location on the planet and the local KYC/AML regulations if they exist. In Canada, the operators (Bitcoiniacs) had the machine running with the KYC/AML features on and then off. They decide.
Govt's typically use photo ID and finger prints to identify ppl. Finger prints are useful to them as they can be left at the scene. Palm vein or finger vein patterns are of no use to Govts, and are not left behind.
Robocoin machines do not change the fundamentals of Bitcoin. It is just an option for ppl whom don't mind being in compliance with KYC/AML regulations. No one is forced to use them, and nothing has changed in your case. You comment has no logic, unless I've missed something massive.

Nowhere, just over there somewhere with no names! Let us stick to English, the language of this forum and the most international language used throughout the world. The language Satoshi Nakamoto's used to write 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.' 
This forum has users such as developers Gavin Andresen &amp; Peter Todd whom has contributed in the last day or so. I gather others do too that I've forgotten right now.  Promoter Andreas Antonopoulos uses this forum. Patrick Byrne of Overstock has used this forum.
A reporter referred to this site when looking at "Community reaction" in a Coindesk article titled 'BitFury Pulls 1PH/s of Mining Power from Ghash.io Amid Community Uproar'
"*Community reaction*
*The varied responses to Ghash.io’s growing influence in the mining network were perhaps most visible on reddit, where bitcoin miners and enthusiasts partook in an impassioned discussion throughout the day.*"
The article has a large focus on "community." This is not the only article form Coindesk I've seen. Monet &amp; Tech also refer to reddit here

They are not really your coins because you don't have ultimate control over them. Coinbase controls them, just like Mark Karpeles controlled coins ppl gave him in trust. You are trusting Coinbase to give you access to the coins. You are relying on Coinbase being in operation! Satoshi Nakamoto went to the trouble of making a wallet so that ppl could manage their coins. That concept is lost on many ppl. Get yourself a wallet and take ownership of your coins.

Human nature is what it is and the dogecoin community is not immune: There was a episode on the Simpsons where if I remember correctly, Lisa pointed out that everyone has their nemesis, even Maggie 
I listened to an interview where a dogecoin fan was talking about how he spammed countless reddit forums and admitted to annoying a lot of people but also got people interested. On r/bitcoin this can be construed as "those r/bitcoin forum members are so angry". As I like to joke "but my (doge)spam is fun". I've been following Bitcoin for years but have only been in the market for a year. I started using this forum and was dismayed by the intrusion from r/dogecoin members. When I see neg posts, all too often they are from dogecoin fans whom are taking a stab and trolling (not Auroracoin, Peercoin or Flappycoin..almost always dogecoin!). Wish I could just show you some examples right now but I can't be bothered sifting and trying to find some of the examples I've come across. I came to the conclusion that the attack bitcoin (as our nemesis) nature of some members of the dogecoin community works. It is part of the reason I purchased some dogecoins!!!.

Failure is good - Mt.Gox was wobbly for a long time. Everyone except those who stayed clear of the wobbly one failed. Failure is part of capitalism. Thank you Mt.Gox for finally failing completely. You gave plenty of warnings. Now people with bitcoins are much smarter, they don't store coins at centralised third parties like Coinbase, Bitcurex or Mt.Gox.

I don't work for any company related to cryptocurrencies. Operators around the world decide whether or not to implement the KYC/AML features. From my understanding, operators, whom decide to implement the KYC/AML measures which include the palm scan biometric in the case of the Robocoin machine can join a global network of machines that know you as a customer (like a bank account). In this case, Robocoin would store the information within their databases. You seem to have made up your mind that Robocoin is interested in collecting peoples palm biometrics in order to resell them. You also talk about other projects. Please provide the source/s that caused these concerns.

I utilise the Bitcoin ecosystem, as imperfect as it is. Things are improving over time. :-)
*The Robocoin machine palm scan is optional. Operators around the world can decide on whether to implement the palm scan option. If you deem that the palm scan (or finger print scan on other machines) biometric is not required under law, contact the operator whom runs the machine*

Cool, I'm setting a tech illiterate South African born work associate up with bitcoins this weekend here in Sydney, Australia. He is in his 50s. He is a little anxious about bitcoin because it seems too complicated and he wonders how he can convert it to "real money." He has a 'dumb phone' and no email address. He has a large extended family in Soweto as I recall (could be wrong). I've pledged to back him so he won't ever receive less Australian dollars ($1000 AUD) that he is putting into the Bitcoin network (my good deed for the day).

Ya I agree, a lot of smart people picked up on what Bitcoin is and took higher risks years ago now. The path has been paved, yet how can new comers will really appreciate this. Bitcoin is the battering ram with the waggling finger getting pointed from every direction. Now, Bitcoin is being attacked by some people coming into cryptocurrencies and eyeing alt coins as a better chance of quick profits.
Spamming everywhere and giving away 'tips' is the way to draw people into the currency you are trying to pump. Bitcoin still takes the brunt of politics and criticisms that other cryptocurrencies are not taking. I've only been involved since March 2013. I'm already getting a bit weary. People whom have been in it for years must have heard to all. The constant shots from the sidelines get a little repetitive &amp; tiring at times.
Still, it is such an interesting time, and I enjoy being involved.

When prices shift we see the real intent. That is what the marketing is all about etc. I'm not going to see approx 50% of the posts on rd0gecoin devoted to "1 d0ge = 1 d0ge" unless the price drops a long way further. I like the marketing aspect to it though. I do expect to see a couple of posts about the d0gecoin price vs the moon. Jackson is clearly aware of peoples want for "the moon". People generally want greater purchasing power….no matter how you attempt to paint over or around it. I have hard earned money converted to d0gecoins. I don't want to lose my purchasing power either.
In the silver and gold bug community, it is common to pass off lower prices as "buying opportunities". "1 doge = 1 doge" has the same tone as "buying opportunities". It is about marketing and psychology.

As cryptocurrencies get bigger, Governments will inevitably take more and more notice. That is already happening of course. It is inevitable, that Government's will seek greater control (like telcos). Governments on mass may make cryptocurrencies illegal yet, through complete desperation. That is a bridge to be crossed if it comes. With the masses on board, Governments are going to have less power to make cryptocurrencies illegal to have or use.
At the end of the day, it is about the code and math. If the code and math is more accessible to non-tech people and the wider community in general, I think that is great. If you want to set up a wallet without using an ID, do it. Bitcoin can be anon if you want anon. It is different things to different people.

If operator Chris McAlary enables the KYC/AML capabilities of the machine, then it will require a palm vein scan in order to identify the same physical person via the pattern. A bank teller uses their eye sight vs a photo ID instead. Governments generally use finger prints and photos to ID ppl. Finger prints can get left behind and cameras pick up a persons image.

When it comes to interfacing, people will pay and go with maybe a few seconds of wait at most.

What people fail to realise, is that Robocoin gives purchasing operators of their machines, the option of utilising the KYC/AML features. Depending on ones location around the world, the operator makes the decision.
The "first bitcoin" ATM at Wavs Cafe in Canada is operated by Bitcoiniacs. They originally had the KYC/AML functions on then decided to turn them off. They decide. not Robocoin.

I don't have the answer sorry. I'm not an operator.
This user might know: /user/AtlantaBitcoin
Check this comment from an apparent operator: 
"I operate a Lamassu kiosk and while the manufacturer has recently developed software enhancements to comply with KYC/AML regulations, I have chosen not to implement them. Yeah, my ass is on the line here, but I've used the Robocoin machine and felt it was very intrusive. I like the idea of anonymity and I don't want to have to keep records of my customers' identities and monitor their private transactions. That's not Satoshi's way, nor is it mine. So far, I'm operating well under the radar and I'm not very worried about it (though some attorneys have warned me that I am taking a huge risk by following this path). I have a FinCen license, but there are no final state licensing regulations (yet), so until they tell me what I have to do to stay out of jail, I will continue to operate my machine as it was shipped, without collecting personal information from the users. The only "compliance" feature I've turned on so far is a maximum transaction limit of $500 USD. This is partly to avoid having to file Suspicious Activity Reports, but mainly to keep me from running out of bitcoins on a daily basis." - by Magg0tt

The machines are capable of compliance with Fincen's regulations according to Robocoin whom manufacture them. Thus the machine operator decides whether to implement KYC/AML features. The operator would surely receive 'Red flag' reports when 'red flags' are warranted according to Fincen (providing the operator sets the machine up appropriately). I'm not a machine operator and don't know the exact  trade amounts vs frequency etc that are going set off 'red flags' FIncen would be interested in. Here is a guide to the Fincen regulations (they forgot to add that HSBC is exempt). 
The machines can be used with fiat currencies beyond the USD and other countries will have variant regulations. Thus modifications would surely be made by various operators. Operators Bitcoiniacs in Canada ditched the KYC features completely making the machine run anon unlike Mt.Gox, Coinbase, BitPay, Coinjar, Bitstamp…..yada yada…. the operators decide.

I realise your average Joe could not give a f*ck about 'decentralised' so, who knows what is going to happen. I will migrate my wealth, as will many others. It won't go a presumptuous stranger.

100% spot on.
Coinbase = Mt.Gox 2.0 ...in some ways (yet another bank for bitcoins!!)
Trusting third parties with ones bits is antithetical to bitcoin.
Some ppl try to purchase things from exchanges and such. The lag time as the coins are released can mess up the sale. Ppl don't use their own wallets.
When will Coinbase be shut down by the FBI for money laundering? Try getting those coins then.

It is simply the "drug" factor vs a history govt/media induced public perception. Marijuana is connected with people going to jail around the planet. Marijuana can be used for good reasons and abused too, like many other drugs. Some are glad when they kick their habit.
Bitcoin needs stories about things that have nothing to do with drugs.
It is a PR thing now, that is all. It is not about whether marijuana is for the greater good or bad in the wider scheme of things.

From a recent thread:
We stumbled upon an interesting exploit on Coinbase when making the hosting payments for our group buys. At first I was like "Woah! An extra 24BTC, bank error in your favor, sweet!... "
But this isn't a bank...it's Bitcoin, and the bug I stumbled upon could have been deadly in the wrong hands. I figured out the details of how to replicate it and reported it to Coinbase ~ who promptly fixed their code and hooked me up for the find.
I'm impressed by Coinbase's responsiveness and professionalism, and very grateful for the reward.

People in professions with high responsibly or business entrepreneurs will be more familiar with regulations and the need for compliance. The machine is 2-way - Another 2-way bitcoin ATM uses a finger print. A guy with a Lamassu machine in Albuquerque resorted to taking down people IDs at the machine in order to be able to operate it with out the threat of jail time. The Robocoin palm scan is optional, it can be turned off if the operator wants. The operator can turn it off but it is a matter of compliance - KYC/AML. Banks see you in person and photo ID is used to identify when required. Regular ATMs have daily restrictions on withdrawal amounts. Women especially may not want to meet up with strangers to cash in or out of bitcoins. But hey, lets get rid of these 2-way KYC/AML compliant machines, because we are too hard for this.

I've heard it surmised, that if another crypto currency overtakes Bitcoin, this could start a cascade of decreasing confidence. Because, each coin will be looking over its shoulder for the next one coming. This could lead to a flattening out of the markets with no coin having stability through significant market depth. Just thousands of coins with no significant volume. I want to see the banks of the world challenged. I regard that various bankers and politicians are responsible for stealing peoples wealth via various means. I want people to have an alternative that is strong and has utility. This is like a dream to me. I'm cynical though, but still hope to see such a thing in the decades to come. I know things can get dirty. I've even witnessed police agent provocateurs here in Australia. That is just the low level devious stuff, and most people are not aware it even exists. Interesting times :-)

If coins are at an exchange, the coins are owned by the exchange because they have access to the private keys.

* Bit-Wallet         1W &amp; 2W No KYC functions.
* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. POS functionality including staff tips feature.
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.

It is ultimately up to the OPERATOR of each "ATM" vs the location of the machine and the regulations. The KYC/AML functions are optional on machines such as the Robocoin machines, and thus I would imagine that other machines may provide the KYC/AML options also. The OPERATOR decides. They are the ones looking to stay out of jail. One operate of a Lamassu machine, positioned himself beside the machine to record everyones IDs independently. He would not have done this for fun.
Various banks around the would or on the same street may have variances in how they conduct their KYC/AML measures.

WTF are you on. Who said this is easier than cash and why should that apply to you or I?
If cash works for you, use it. I have cash like using it.
Due to the KYC aspect, one has to jump through the same hoops pretty much as someone setting up a bank account at a bricks and mortar bank.
Bitcoin is best suited to internet peer to peer transactions in my experience. Innovation will improve other aspects as the years roll on. Some of us appreciate the fact the banksters don't get to print bitcoins as they please. Others will not care for this aspect. I don't think Bitcoin is for everyone. It is a choice one makes.

There are numerous disabilities. Blindness is yet another disability.
Traditional banks have the benefit of making an account with the customer face to face and thus may have policies to suit various disabilities. Bitcoin ATMs with credit card function may be an option for the worlds disabled people whom have bank accounts to begin with. Bitcoin ATM manufacturers don't have that face to face facility which, like anything else, can have its benefits. To my knowledge, you won't find any Bitcoin ATMs that cater to all disabilities.
The market place is ripe for innovation.
What has stopped you thus far from designing and producing the world's first bitcoin ATM that caters to all manner of amputees, the blind and illiterate. Multi lingual features come to mind also. What verification procedures do you  want to implement?

People who have credit cards, have already gone through the hassles at a bank to get them. At the bank, there is a face to face encounter and photo ID is utilised as a means of identification. 2-way BTC ATMs don't have the human face to face encounter. Biometrics are the substitute.

KYC/AML - non compliance can mean jail. It depends on the location of the machine on the planet as to what compliance is required. Two way machines generally require more compliance. That is why finger print and palm scans may be required. That is why companies have finger and palm scans. Banks see people face to face and photo ID is used.


Operators want to stay out of jail. People on the side lines with little understanding may want to throw stones.

I came to this subreddit months ago to find out about the news and tech. Many of the people here are very clever and I can learn from them. I don't want to wade through dogecoin stuff as well and feel insulted. I've given a lot to other people in my life! I laugh and joke with people every day! 
I can't think of another alt coin that comes anywhere near the dogecoin spam volume on this reddit. To me it seems like at least 95% of the altcoin spam is dogecoin!  Quite amazing actually. I'd suspect many at r/dogecoin would lose their sense of humour quickly enough if a coin was spammed there to the same degree dogecoin is spammed on this reddit. We are all just humans.

Thanks! I never fiddled with the voting of comments. Just realised the 'child' function. Need to learn how people put the perpendicular line before quotes now on this forum. One of the factors James D'Angelo points out, is that it is much less expensive to put together a 51% attack. He mentions using more than 75%. Truly wealthy people or organisations should be capable of a huge %age attacks. I'm eagerly waiting for part 2 of James' video (he has left watchers on a limb).
James has done a lot of work to educate people about Bitcoin. I've made instructional vids too (really basic ones). We both want Bitcoin to proper. I want to know the cold hard reality though. I don't want enthusiasts with blinders on telling me a massive hashing power attack would cost this much when it is really much cheaper as James describes. (I need to watch James' vid again.

Hi, glad you found the info useful. The world's "first Bitcoin ATM" was claimed to be the Robocoin manufactured machine run by Bitcoiniacs in Canada at Waves Coffee. Bitcoiniacs initially ran the machine with KYC (and prob AML) functions and then turned them off later. The operator to the machine you have used can do the same. It is all the operator vs local regulations. The operator may decide to take on a certain amount of risk too! By contacting the operator of the machine you have used, they will surely give you their POV as to why they have taken the approach they have. Generally, and especially when it comes to business, no one wants to inconvenience others for the sake of it. Kind regards from Australia.

This is not a Lamassu one way machine (I've used the Lamassu, both times I had to wait while the operators sorted the machine out to operate, nice when it is working but NOT two way). The Robocoin machine is two way. Two way is a big deal if you want KYC/AML compliance. 3 factors of ID and identifies your physical presence. I'm not familiar with banks asking for less.
1) “We actually do palm vein scanning, which we think is far more secure, private and accurate than fingerprint. The palm vein scan is actually an infrared image of the customer’s palm vein patter—the second most unique form of biometric authentication. This biometric data is stored by our partner, Fujitsu,” Kelley said.
2) Robocoin on first glance appears to be the more robust of the two manufacturers. It’s the one that Benjamin and I are leaning towards.  It costs in the neighborhood of  $20k and runs a KYC and AML (know your client and anti-money laundering) platform that employs a three-step verification process. These include your palm print, your ID and a photo to ensure that you are who you say you are.
Maybe you are not familiar with opening bank accounts and compliance issues. I would like to see your improved design for a two way cash to BTC machine that can be distributed world wide and confidently meet the KYC/AML compliance codes of countries across the planet.

In the early days of the internet, the geeks were ahead of the curve too. Bitcoins did not even have a price for the first 6 months or so. Tech people were fiddling around with Satoshi Nakamoto's invention. That is why people threw out computers with wallets that are now worth heaps of money!. They did not think the bitcoins had any value. The risk was way greater than what it is now. How times have changed! Mainstream people still don't understand how the internet works. They just use it because it is easy enough to use and convenient. Bitcoin and altcoin tech is still techy and clunky. Things need to improve over the next few years. Things are not ready for the mainstream yet. Mainstream people don't question where federal reserve banks come search for alternatives to government run monetary monopolies. The cryptocurrencies will simply need to offer relative convenience and lower fees as an enticement for the mainstream. Saving money is something people can understand. For those in countries where the currency is poorly managed cryptocurrencies may offer some salvation in the future. When the Cyprus banking closures happened in March 2013, Bitcoin's price rocketed up. Interesting times… :-)

KYC unreasonable? You must oppose: Mt.Gox, BitPay, Coinbase, Lamassu, Bitstamp and many other bitcoin related businesses whom seek to comply with regulations. These companies have "no virtue".
From Lamassu's website:
Some jurisdictions may have regulatory requirements (such as KYC/AML). We would advise to consult with an attorney prior to operating these machines. If you are located in the US, we require a signed due diligence questionnaire prior to shipping.
From Lamassu CEO: 
As a pure hardware vendor, "we decided to divorce ourselves completely from the operator's service," says Zach Harvey, cofounder (with his brother Josh) of Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures. We "don't want to handle the regulatory side."
Many Bitcoin businesses have been under regulatory scrutiny after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidance on virtual currency in March.
In light of the regulatory concerns, "we like to stay reasonably paranoid in this industry," Harvey says.

In bitcoin, dealers become anon because their bitcoin address does not have to have a name attached to it (Bitcoin can be anon). Cash is not mailed to the dealer, giving away their location. The dealer never has a face to face transaction as with cash, or gives away a physical location via receiving cash by mail. This has to be very appealing for drug dealers. I'm very much aware of the fact that Bitcoin did not introduce drug dealers to the world. I was informed that via the SR website, mailing addresses were hidden from authorities.

BTW, Bitcoin already succeeds as currency. People happily use it as a means of exchange. If people choose not to use it due to volatility, that is their choice. Bitcoin still works for others regardless. Bitcoin succeeds for others because it gives them freedom to 'donate to wikileaks' where one could argue other currencies may fail (for them) due to restrictions.
Bitcoin may succeed as a means of giving an artist across the world a micro-payment where other currencies do not succeed due to the fees vs the actual micro-payment.
For Tomcar, bitcoin assists them to save over $50,000 AUD in fees from transmitting other monies for their car parts. They save via Bitcoins low fees.

Such is life. The very room I'm in right now was entered by intruders at night whilst I was away overseas at the time (luckily). Because there are so many junkies in my area, I concealed my laptop and the intruders did not find it. Other items were stolen though. This goes with the territory unfortunately. The police noticed the concealed laptop when they inspected the room. Thousands of dollars worth of other thefts and damage occurred though at this home. I have little doubt it was junkies. Another person was here sleeping during the intrusion. Luckily no one was hurt. I have plenty of stories, mostly negative (a death, children neglected, betrayal yada sigh). It sucks that innocent people suffer whilst not being part of the "drugs" ecosystem. We can blame laws and we can blame all sorts of things, even peoples choices. A woman here in Australia blames bitcoin for here son's death. Great subject. I'm a wee bit over it…..but know there is heaps of bad press to come. Joy of joys!

No, I don't think so. The early press reports detailed that the KYC/AML features were utilised by Bitcoiniacs initially. Poster is no doubt correct. Operator Bitcoiniacs decided to turn the KYC/AML features off some time after the initial launch of the machine at Waves Cafe. reckons it was a couple of weeks later post launch in October 2013.

I've transacted with bitcoin at a 'bricks and mortar' bar. I never said other crypto coins can't do the same thing. I didn't mention that because is beside the point. Bitcoins confirmations are too slow for people to be waiting around for them at bricks and mortar businesses. I don't want to wait 15 seconds for a confirmation!!!. It is generally not something you need to do for day-to-day purchases. Buying a car or real estate would incur a wait….but that is not such a big deal.
BitPay and other companies have worked around the 10 minute confirmation aspect if retailers find it an issue.
Bitcoin is not perfect, nor is it competing with perfect.
Again, I purchased beer at a bar, and left the bar immediately. Beer paid with bitcoins. No waiting for Bitcoin or theoretical Quark confirmations required.

Yes, I think stable bitcoin prices are preferable, but the market is way too small for that. It has to grow so that one player can't rock the market around as easily. Historically, bitcoin prices seem to rocket up high and down a less amount quickly and then settle somewhat. I expect that to happen at least one more time.
Ahh..love "peejo" and loved the entrepreneurial spirit in China, cheers!.

When I started reading this subreddit a few months ago, I was dismayed at all the dogecoin tipping and spamming throughout. I've called a few dogecoin posters out on it, and it is taken as being hostile. But then, Reddcoin tipping got banned from the dogecoin subreddit which I've found to a most ironic twist of events. A low tolerance for competition has been displayed. I have dogecoins because I realised how aggressively the coins are marketed. Bitcoins were given out in the earliest days to get things going. It is going to interesting to see how spammy/tippy things get.

I think bits is the best solution although if 'bitcoin' was transitioned to the 'bits' denomination this would be even better.
I've purchased coffee and had the staff member serving not knowing whether to get me to wait around due to the transaction being unconfirmed. I make transactions and go. If bitcoin complicates this, then I'm using an alternative. I don't want to concern myself with waiting processes due to shop attendants not being confident with my transaction in a timely manner (even if their lack of confidence is not warranted). Transactions need to be done in a timely fashion. Shops need to move customers through the check-outs ASAP too.

Significant amounts of bitcoins should be in peoples own wallets. In the future, appropriate third party services may eventuate..but ideally, one should have control over their pvt key.

*I don't want someone having the info that "Bitcoin address x belongs to John Smith. Here are his fingerprints."* - If this is what you want, then go about acquiring Bitcoin via an anonymous process. An example might be by making cash payments to a seller of bitcoins. You could do some work and get paid in bitcoins too. 
*Are there any bitcoin vending machines where you can actually buy it anonymously?* - the Robocoin machines are capable of being anonymous. It just depends on the operator of the machine. In the case of "the world's first Bitcoin ATM" at Waves Coffee in Canada, the operators (Bitcoiniacs) turned the palm scan feature and other KYC/AML features off after a few weeks. It is their choice. I believe the Robocoin at Waves Coffee is currently running in anon mode.
The Lamassu vending machines do not require ID. In one case in America, an operator of a Lamassu machine at a cigar shop resorted to taking down ppls IDs as they used the machine. This was done to surely meet KYC/AML requirements and keep him out of jail.

Banks use photo ID, but banks get to see you face to face. ATMs have restrictions on daily money amounts.
I wish people would stop bashing people who innovate, unless they are clearly trying to defraud people. Life is full of hassles, even in the US and here in Australia. But these regulatory hassles pale in comparison to the hassles other people currently put up with in less developed countries. Here in Australia, I purchased my first bitcoins by meeting a stranger (a tech guy working for Google) face to face. Women may not wish to do this. A two way machine is a potential point of access to the bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for women especially. Using ATMs in busy public places is something women are generally confident to do, here in Australia.

From what I can gather, someone with lots of money can create a 75% attack on Bitcoin simply to destroy it (lets not waste time talking about 51% and power costs: Some people have serious money). They would not give a toss about cashing out or whatever. There is good reason to destroy Bitcoin if you figure it could cut into your own business profits. $20 million or even $500 million is going to be money some people can afford to lose.

Edit (post further research): Question sorted out: "Operators who do not enable KYC compliance manage and operate their own segregated non-identified user network and do not join this special global group."

lol..."Case closed" - you are obviously not a judge. If the palm scan frightens some people, that does not make it pointless.  The operators need to consider their circumstance. Read again - "….switched off pending further MAS KYC updates!"
MAS = Money Authority of Singapore.
KYC = Know Your Customer.
“We actually do palm vein scanning, which we think is far more secure, private and accurate than fingerprint. The palm vein scan is actually an infrared image of the customer’s palm vein patter—the second most unique form of biometric authentication. This biometric data is stored by our partner, Fujitsu,” Kelley said.
Source: 
The palm scan is an unfamiliar technology. People can have fears about unfamiliar tech. Example:
1)Google glasses - 
2) iPhone finger print - 
3) iPhone GPS fear -

Many ppl don't (and some can't) understand that various bitcoin "ATMs" have KYC and AML features that can be activated by the OPERATOR of each machine to suit their needs. The Generalbytes machine provides a KYC biometric option. The machine does not require your fingerprint to function! The most invasive KYC biometric measure is ones photo ID (this is by far the most trackable and widely used).
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.
* atm4coin         1W &amp; 2W Open source project..ongoing. Machine availability?
* Bit-Wallet         1W &amp; 2W No KYC functions.
* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. POS functionality including staff tips feature.
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.
* BTCpoint          2W KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* Coinoutlet         2W KYC/AML options (operators decide) ID scan if required. Accepts altcoins if configured. Online shopping module.
* Coinplug           2W AML feature (not known if optional) KYC? (Korean) 
* Diamond Circle  2W Visa/MC not cash. KYC (via bank CCs) and AML variances for operators.
* Dogevertise ATM 2W Bitcoin, Lite &amp; Doge too. No KYC functions.
* Genesis1          2W Optional fingerprint reader/gov ID &amp; bank card reader for operators. Lite/Doge too
* Localbitcoins ATM 2W Nil KYC features.
* Robocoin          2W Optional ID scan/palm vein scan/camera &amp; optional AML feature for operators (now Compulsory KYC for the USA)

I am not a machine operator, nor do I work for any company with any affiliation to Bitcoin.
Lamassu machines are capable of requiring ID via scanning. Robocoin machines are capable of scanning ones ID, taking a photo and scanning the vein pattern of the palm. The Robocoin machine simply has more options. The operators of these machines decide whether or not to implement the the various KYC features.
Depending on the operator, you need no ID to use the Robocoin machine or the Lamassu machine. Both can run anonymously! Bitcoiniacs initially set their Robocoin machine up to demand IDs. They then later set the machine up to accept no IDs. The operator decides.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs" I've put together:

"...he just sold his bitcoins" - Nope. Don't fear monger. He stated he sold half of his bitcoins as I recall. (ahh..see link)
Peter Todd still has bitcoins!. Plenty of skin in the game.
GHash's "success" has lowered my view of bitcoin, and Peter Todd wrote that he had a similar view. Peter Todd potentially has real conviction when it comes to Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralised Bitcoin network. I certainly have a level of conviction too, thus I can understand people taking personal action, when the decentralised aspect is assaulted. I sold a little too. Was thinking of selling a lot…that may come.

Things need to change. People can't afford a bitcoin because they are too expensive. I've donated part of a bitcoin that quickly got covered to dogecoins.

"you guys" - I initially just came to this subreddit to read about bitcoin. I started noticing the constant dogecoin references far beyond any other alt coin and found it annoying. I don't like the cartoons much. I've been following the path of bitcoin for years from the sidelines. Bitcoin is still a joke (yes a joke, I have friends who laugh at me for having some), a ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme, a NWO currency to many, internet drug money and now "a serious coin for assholes" via some dogecoin marketers including Jackson a times. Luckily, the positive attitude of the bitcoin community forged away since the genesis of bitcoin (and thus dogecoins code) from the earliest days of 2009. I have dogecoins but I'm not a spamming taunting asshole (when not on r/dogecoin). I also have bitcoins and I know that the early adopters took even more shit in the earliest days. They still get shit from some people!..and now people like me want less risk and rides to the moon via alt coins. Anyway,…this whole dogecoin thing on r/bitcoin is just BS because it is manufactured via the marketing and spamming to give dogecoin the association with bitcoin. It is effective, IMO. No other alt coin marketing/community is this intrusive and aggressive. I bought some dogecoins because I've come to realise that the mix of tipping, spamming and the 'attack bitcoin' stance is effective. The want of money is at the root of the behaviours, with what ever marketing facades that may be layered on top. I have a mix of various coins. There will be people I would regard as good or bad in every group of peoples. Whether it is a church gathering or a crypto currency gathering, Lol. I don't care for facades and hive minds as best as I can. Bitcoin (and various other alt coins) may die in a couple ways yet….

Oh, never mind decentralisation. Mt.Gox and other centralised failures are doing so well for Bitcoin. The damage to Bitcoin via Gox is huge. It is possible that some nefarious hacker now has approx 6% of the bitcoins!!. INSANE stuff…  . I realise people are used to paying banks for securing their funds and that old habits die hard. People are lazy and not tech savvy. Bitcoin may never be for the masses due to the inability to store the coins. The tech is getting better with multisig but………at this point in time exchanges are not banks and should not be trusted. In the future I expect some safer options for people. Bitcoin is not for the masses now, IMO. Lots more coins are going to be lost to failing centralised third parties.

In a cash situation, the dealer has no anonymity right. Law enforcement would rather catch the dealer. By receiving cash for drugs, a dealer has no way of protecting their location from an undercover officer posing as a buyer?…thoughts

Bitcoin is a decentralised P2P network. There is going to be risk when it comes to parting with your bitcoins for a service/consumer product etc….so prepare to lose your coins. Choose to deal with parties with the least risk. That is the free-market working to weed out bad players. Life has it risks, mind that bus and mind whom you trade with.
Bitcoin is not perfect, nor is it competing with perfect.
"Trust no one" (including Mark karpeles)- When it comes to storage of ones coins. Mt.Gox was not the first and won't be the last third party to steal/lose etc other peoples coins. I don't really consider coins exclusively mine unless I have sole access to the private key.

Nope, it's all about dogecoin..again and again and again. SPAM is fun. Are the dogecoin threads spammed with Vertcoin fan posts?

Nailed it - although I'm pissed at GHash, other pools may take their place. "Success" would be individual miners decentralised across the planet or something closer to it. Bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin with a pool controlling 50% or over, IMO. Bitcoin is about 'decentralised.'

Bitcoin is an experiment. I don't regard it as serious. It may fail badly for some reason yet. It is just money and that does not change no matter which label you attach to it, or which marketing gimmicks. If Bitcoin and altcoins it continue to work….cool. I have various coins. Shibecoin amount them. Altcoins can have more upside than bitcoin due to the smaller markets and higher volatility. That is a reason why people can find them appealing. Better chance of a profit. The OP of this very thread was involved in d0ge for that reason. I have d0ge for that reason. D0ge is also serious about marketing, I regard it as aggressive marketing. Tons of spamming and 'tip to vest' marketing and more. Another reason I have d0ge.

A shit load of bitcoins sitting at Mt.Gox collecting "dust" is pointless. The coins are not earning Mt.Gox any interest. Only coins being trading traded earn Mt.Gox a coin or two of their own.
Mt.Gox is not a bank, just as it is not Bitcoin. Mt.Gox ran right up to the point where Mark Karpeles is seemingly claiming that hardly any coins are there. Empty.Gox!. It is perhaps that shit load of coins and the claim that they are now gone, that has caused the problems we still 'can't see' today at Mt.Gox.
Why couldn't the exchange just run as an exchange….it should never have been a place to park ones coins. Mt.Gox, the dodgy garage of no fixed address to which you have no key to!!!!. Let us use some common sense and respect what Bitcoin is actually about.

One aspect of the marketing of Dogecoin goes along the lines of taking a stab at ppl whom use bitcoins.

Then there is the "we don't care about price" marketing!!!

We are all just people. The tech people and anarchic type people happen to the ones who got into bitcoin in the early days. I have no reason to dislike the early adopters. Things were different in the early days. Bitcoin did not even really have a price for about 6 months and it was not until wobbly Mt.Gox came along that things kind of sorted out. Tons of risk back then. Much less now. Tons of crap has been fired at bitcoin for years. The early adopters have put up with a lot of doubters and negativity from the sidelines. It can surely get tiring. Clever people may also find certain amounts of stupidity extra annoying also (I'm not super clever like many people who got into the space early).
Not all of us are great socially, nor do we all make great marketers or spokespeople. One thing that surely is common amongst everyone, is that we don't mind to see the value of our cryptocurrencies rise against the USD for example. Many of us who have come in later now want part of the action, whether we crap on about 'one doge equals one doge' or whatever fake crap people burp out. That is life. We all have our aspirations and I certainly have an aspect of greed in me. I'm also generous with people. I've given lots of time and money to others in my life thus far. I don't hate actual bankers (the person), nor people involved in various cryptocurrencies. I like politeness, but I'm not always polite. Greed and so forth are part of humanity. We can pretend we are somehow special :-)

From the perspective of the greater public: No, because the greater public does not connect their cash with shady drug deals. Bitcoin is connected in the minds of people I've talked to. It is pure perception I'm referring to. They can't get passed the "drugs" aspect with bitcoin. From my POV, I've found myself trying to talk about a great monetary concept of Bitcoin but because of the "drug dealers" the perception is negative. Lucky me, "drug dealers" have made my short conversations too f*king difficult. I've had enough things stolen from me via drug addicts as it is.

Thanks for your considered replies. I'm not concerned about web retailers waiting for confirmations. My concern is for the safety of bricks and mortar retailers where waiting around for more than 7-8 seconds is staring to stretch it…if you know what I mean. Things need to be relatively snappy. I would NOT wait for 10 minutes at a retailer for a bitcoin confirmation. I would rather pay extra in traditional cash or CC and go. *If I was purchasing a car, I would make an exception.

I agree with your comment. I just feel the current bitcoin community is not a community that realises the value to marketing and perception. I now find myself looking for potential currencies that have the right people marketing it. With great marketing, another crypto currency will potentially dethrone bitcoin in no time. The problem with this though, is that is may severely bring down the ecosystem, as each coin "looks over it's shoulder" for the next coming coin and people have less confidence (as per Adam Back). Marketing is important nonetheless, and being out of touch with non-tech people is a bad mistake. Such is life.

Many people across the world have bitcoins. People of different ages, sex and racial groups. The early adopters of bitcoins were mainly tech guys interested in "SN" experiment. Indeed, I bought my first bitcoins from a guy working for google. If you think all or even most people with bitcoins hate people for having subsequent copies and variations of the tech, I'd say you are wrong. If your (or mine) alt coins go to the moon along the same lines as bitcoin has done, you may detect a certain amount of smug superiority amidst the community of ppl with that altcoin. ppl r ppl!  I have d0gecoins and I'm well aware of all the moon hype and hope for a trip to the moon within the community. WHo does not want more purchasing power. The price rose recently and half the posts on the subreddit were devoted to the rising price. SUch is life.  
Bitcoin went for quite a while until Mt. Gox formed, bitcoins had no real price realisation vs the Yen or USD. Many ppl lost or threw away wallets on their computers etc. ppl did not think about the price rising!! It was more of an experiment for many. For years many of the early adopters fought to bring bitcoin from nothing to what it is today. Things have vastly changed. Things were certainly much riskier then. Now the rest of us are jumping on the band wagon. Many of us see the altcoins as a means of getting our own moon ride. The ecosystem that is now 100x easier to use and things look a lot more promising these days (more secure).
edit&gt; added &gt; I've paid for stuff with bitcoin at a pub and cafe (as well as online donations/purchases). The transaction is quick enough. QR code scan and pin No. The transaction takes less than 20 seconds in total I did not wait around for confirmations (and don't ever intend to). GreenAddress wallets make for no double spends if that is an issue to a retailer. I will pay by credit card if I have to wait around a shop longer than what a regular CC or cash payment takes. I'm not waiting for 30 seconds or 2.5 minutes for a confirmation. No way. That is not the future for me.

If things don't improve, I will seek to migrate and support something else. Thus far I've supported Bitcoin via a reasonable amount of investment (much more than most I'm sure), getting friends and people on other forums involved including giving them some bits to get started, making videos about bitcoin including wallet set-up and local ecosystem vids, buying stuff with bitcoin, donating to charities, debating people and generally being part of the community. I've invested time and energy into Bitcoin! Leaving is not so easy, and I'm reluctant to just because arseholes who made statements about the threat of high amounts of hashing power and then went and did it themselves exist. GHash are not consistent. If bitcoin ends up being centralised to an entity such as GHash I will be one of many looking to leave and support a decentralised currency…..somehow, someway…Bitcoin is not perfect, nor is it competing with perfect. Ultimately, I want 'decentralised.' I realise mainstream people could not give a f*ck about the concept or much at all for that matter. Such is life.

The manufacturer is investing in Bitcoin infrastructure. They have gone through a process of research, design, manufacturing, promotion and sales. The manufacturer has believed in Bitcoin enough to make an initial investment and has taken on risk. Their business model indicates that they intend to profit from their risk by selling their rigs.

For the record: I trade cryptocurrencies in exchanges myself. I'm not against trading. I take the risk of having coins in them. It they disappear overnight I won't complain. The risk is bleeding obvious. To decrease the risk of losing coins, I take excess coins off the exchanges when possible. Mt.Gox had an unbelievable amount of bitcoins held there in the capable hands of Mark Karpeles. Mt.Gox was treated by many as if it were a Magic the Gathering Bitcoin Bank!. It was not, and everyone involved whom used it as a bank has contributed to damaging the Bitcoin ecosystem.

No kidding Bitcoin is an experiment. Gavin Andresen is a great example of someone whom explains just this. - Many bitcoin users don't even use their own wallets. They "store coins at Mt.Gox and other centralised third parties". Bitcoin could get severely disrupted and possibly taken down anytime with the right amount amount of hashing power (as per James D'Angelos presentations). Costing pocket change to a billionaire. I don't talk about Bitcoin to work colleagues due to the drugs association. I don't advise family to utilise it. I use it, just like I use a car or the internet. I don't completely understand the tech.

1) Bitcoin is not about storing coins at and trusting Coinbase or any other centralised third party with your coins.

Mt Gox was reputable enough for many. Why use a wallet when you have have a Mt Gox account. Even a freaking charity trusted MK with their bitcoins (fhck me dead!!).  It depends on ones view. Mt Gox got the thumbs up from Charlie Shrem for example, pretty much weeks before it finally toppled. Ver gave Mt Gox the thumbs up about 8 or 10 months prior or whatever for having a good facility/tech…. . It was not so long ago Coinbase paid a client 10 BTC (as I recall) for showing them how he could withdraw BTC beyond the BTC he trusted Coinbase to keep for him.

My opinion is that it could close down today and I would have to accept the loss. I keep a minimum amount of coins on the centralised third party BTC-e exchange for obvious reasons. I'm planning to migrate away from BTC-e. I use other exchanges. I may move to ANX as it is probably a more professional, but I'm watching the space. Exchanges will never have a significant amount of "my coins" held in their possession. Bitcoin is not about trusting others like Mark Karpeles or unknown people at BTC-e with coins.

Yes, the graph is very 100% real. Taken about 4 or 5min prior to posting here. I remember only a week ago  or so some people thought GHash retreating to 36% was something to rejoice over. I did not (I was still appalled at 36%). Now GHash has rebounded with more hashing power (estimated hashing power).
Just because an entity has over 50% of the hashing power, does not automatically mean they perform something nefarious. That said, I don't trust Mark Karpeles or GHash.io
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:18:34
In the example of Mt.Gox. It was a huge disaster because so many people assisted to make it a huge disaster by "storing their bitcoins at Mt.Gox" as if it was a bank. I had a poster here over the last day or so telling me Coinbase can be trusted. Coinbase has had it's own problems, right up until recently!. Plus, the US govt could shut it down on a whim if they suspect nefarious goings on.

It is like this, operators customers eventually become biometricly controlled by the global network that controls the biometric data operators have overseen. The plan is to keep selling the biometric data to the other projects and potential future projects. This keeps the customers satisfied that the other projects are going according to variant operator's schedule. The transmission of data via third parties becomes internally prevalent through the biological status of each customer corpus callosum.

Ahh….the open source code, Bitcoin has its risks and third parties are involved in development of bitcoin related coding. The whole thing may fail….so having large amounts of wealth involved is risky behaviour... Yada, yada.
By 'third parties', I'm referring to other humans, not open source soft ware code anyone with access to the internet can read or even modify. This why people involved in bitcoin refer to 'faith in numbers' or cryptography. It's about doing ones own research. Trusting someone like Mark Karpeles differs from trusting open source code someone else has provided.
Bitcoin has been road tested now since 2009, with hack attempts and all. It is an invention and an ongoing experiment. The code is open for people to review (if they have the means). It is the open code that one can choose to put trust in. Essentially, it is cryptography and math. Nonetheless, Bitcoin was never invented as means to go about trusting other people with storage your bitcoins. The wallets are a huge component of Bitcoin. The aim is to avoid third parties. Bitcoin is essentially not for people who want to store their coins with third parties. I don't think Bitcoin is for you.

If things don't improve, I will seek to migrate and support something else. Thus far I've supported Bitcoin via a reasonable amount of investment (much more than most I'm sure), getting friends and people on other forums involved including giving them some bits to get started, making videos about bitcoin including wallet set-up and local ecosystem vids, assisting individuals with wallets, buying stuff with bitcoin, donating to charities, debating people and generally being part of the community. I've invested time and energy into Bitcoin! Leaving is not so easy, and I'm reluctant to just because arseholes who made statements about the threat of high amounts of hashing power, then went and did it themselves. GHash are not consistent. If bitcoin ends up being centralised to an entity such as GHash I will be one of many looking to leave and support a decentralised currency…..somehow, someway…Bitcoin is not perfect, nor is it competing with perfect. Neither is life. Ultimately, I want 'decentralised' as do others. The passion and participation of the community have been essential in forging the success of Bitcoin thus far. I can proudly say, I'm still a part of that, and hope to remain so.

I don't mean to mislead. I'm trying to do my bit and educate a little, Lol.
I'm open to the possibility of an operator deciding on utilising only one or two forms of ID for some reason. Not that I have a logical reason to suggest for this. Maybe, the data could be part of a study at some stage? Maybe in good old Nigeria, a dodgy passport is all that is required, maybe not. I imagine KYC regulations are reasonably uniform across the globe. I'm no expert. Again, I don't mean to mislead, just allowing for greys that may or may not crop up. Yes, with Robocoin's network plan, their KYC standards are set.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:27:39
Yes, it is great to see more machines about. I've used the Lamassu machine here in Sydney a couple of times (when operating it is great) Yet another reason to visit Italy!
Certain companies want ID. Mt. Gox did. Coinbase, BitPay, Coinjar, Bitstamp…etc. I gather you dislike these companies with complete contempt. Robocoin offers a product that is more anon than these companies due to the fact the machine can require no ID. 
Operators decide when it comes to the Robocoin machine. The Robocoin machine operated by Bitcoiniacs in Canada runs with no palm vein pattern scan or photos required. KYC is entirely optional believe it or not. Idealy, sure..no KYC/AML regulations, but in reality…operators have to make the choice. Your beef is with the operators.

It is a given that operators have to decide whether or not to purchase a product vs their location. This is potentially why we don't see hundreds of Lamassu venders around America.

@_date: 2014-05-19 16:50:36
It depends on whether the operators decide to implement the KYC/AML features. Bitcoiniacs in Canada turned the KYC/AML utilities off at Waves Cafe. It is their call, not Robocoins. I actually used a Robocoin ATM with all of the KYC/AML features in operation, due to Austrailain Bitcoin ATMs (ABA) deciding to utilise them. The whole process to sign up (complete KYC) and purchase of bits took approximately 18 minutes. I was not very good at positioning the palm correctly. The Govt ID verification took 5-6 minutes. I liken the process to entering a bank in person and going through with setting up an account. The machine replicates the process a bank gets on to go through, except that it is probably quicker using the machine than setting up an account at a bank. Once the account is set-up, the future transactions are a whole lot quicker. This applies to traditional banks and the Robocoin machine. My actual bitcoin purchase at the end was quick enough.

Did it ever occur to you, the dogecoin spamming is MASSIVE. It is totally ubiquitous. Quite amazing. When the spamming tables were turned r/dogecoin we see what happens. Personally, I don't have a big problem with the intolerant stance at r/dogecoin. I started coming to this subreddit months ago, only to find many of the threads polluted with dogecoin references and the ubiquitous 'tips to vest' people. I had r/dogecoin fans on here putting people down for being stingy and then further harassment for being too serious. Are people who have bitcoin really sub par humans? Bitcoin has paved the way with a varied community of positive people whom have put up with a lot of criticism over the years. Now it comes from some r/dogecoin members too. I've seen plenty of threads that put bitcoin holders down on r/dogecoin but I don't think I've seen one that really focuses on the woes of the banking industry. I'm a reasonably generous person, I don't like the negativity and higher than thou attitude at r/dogecoin. I personally, don't dislike bankers in person. It is the industry and power of it that can cause problems. I generally like people, despite their flaws. (f*ck me! what a rant..Lol)

There has been so much doge spam through this subreddit, like no other. No wonder some people are annoyed with it. It just seems like tons of spam. I found it annoying when the dogecoin fans came in giving bitcoin a hard time. Bitcoin has to deal with the politics and bad actors as well as the good points. There is a slog going on, but new comers to the market are probable not likely to appreciate the legacy. 
The doge developer Palmer was an arsehole for having a go people who have bitcoins for a start. Bitcoin has struggled from zero paving the way with what continues to be an experiment, for all other coins to even exist. No Bitcoin = no dogecoin or any other altcoin. It is still a risk, but nothing like it once was years ago. The dev Palmer then comes in taking at a low shot at people whom have bitcoins saying they think they are "elitist", yet the doge coin promo stuff does not miss out on "such moon" or whatever!. You will have plenty of arseholes thinking they are the shit for jumping on any coin that rockets up in price, no matter what the name of the coin is.
My personal experience with alt coins is that I've hoped to jump on trains to the moon, because I've missed out on the bitcoin train thus far. I'm honest about it. I happen to respect though, that Bitcoin and the people whom have built it up for my benefit deserve my respect overall. 
For some of us, there is more to all of this than making money. Personally, I'm responsible for the making of the sign that is in the window of the Black Rose Anarchist bookshop/cafe here in Sydney. I have more things going on than personal financial gains.
Bit of rant…. :-)

I am not suggesting the loss has anything to do with Coinbase. It freaks me out that people treat these companies as if they are bitcoin banks. The fact that I'm explaining this….did Mt.Gox and many other companies folding never happen. Did anyone learn a lesson. What if there is a fire at Coinbase that compromises there computers. Coinbase have had security problems. Even in the last couple of months. Use your own wallets people. ….but we all want banks to look after our coins.

Sure, authorities can entrap users by selling to them. On a website that relies on feedback, the seller cred would disappear. When it comes to cashing out, a suitable country might be in order and an cash out from a coin like Zerocoin might be in order. I think bitcoin will have options for increased anonymity too in the future. I certainly hope the illicit drug traders don't screw things up big time in the future. Of course there are other threats too. I've seen police agent provocateurs in Australia here and know that govts are capable of much more devious games. I hope bitcoin survives.

I joined this reddit and this subreddit a few months ago to assist in keeping track of what is happening with Bitcoin. From my POV, this sub appeared to be spammed and at times taunted by people touting one coin well beyond any other. But "my spam is just fun" or recently "but I'm just agreeing with you and tipping you doge" (my comment was favourable to well marketed altcoins, you see).

The Robocoin palm scan is optional (see link). It depends on the operator of the machine. Robocoin simply gives the operator a biometric option.

It is stupid to keep coins at you can't afford to lose at exchanges or any centralised third party. Don't treat Coinbase like a bank. DON'T TRUST CENTRALISED THIRD PARTIES WITH YOUR COINS. The whole Mt.Gox drama was unnecessary. You are supposed to store your bitcoins on your own wallet that you control.  
Here is a video I made:
 
People are so used to relying on banks to store their money, that they can't understand the concept of Bitcoin. Just remember that people pay banks fees that assist to pay for security measures and security guards. With Bitcoin, your are the security guard to educate yourself and then educate others.
BTW, download YOUR OWN wallet (see my video via the link). Then let me know your address and I'll send you a few Satoshis to get you started.

I agree. To add: From my experience of talking with people (general public), the SR and Shrem arrests have nothing for the perception of bitcoin…I recently got.."Is it legal" amidst a conversation stuck at "drugs and hit men". The Bitcoin community is perhaps a little oblivious to this damaging perception held my members of the public whom don't know much about bitcoin. The cases are still to go to trial…so there is going to be plenty more Bitcoin = "drugs" reinforcement for by-standers to soak up. The FBI selling off the SR coins could be interesting to.

Ya, it is sad that those who trusted Mark Karpeles with their bitcoins have collectively helped to make the ecosystem potentially very volatile in the future. The amount of coins that have been stolen and the general shenanigans is nuts. 15% is high but not far off 12.5%. Bitcoin is unique to all other cryptocoins in many ways. It is the battering ram as it always has been. It's taken some huge hits and has unfortunately collected it's fair share of bad actors along the way.

I like humour, but KYC/AML vs "one way vs 'two way' and time and location around the planet. It is an absolute mine field, and going to jail is srz biznis for those on the front lines.
Banks have to identify you. They meet you face to face or restrict you via ATMs. Here in Australia, my bank asks me for my photo ID. Bitcoin ATM don't have the f2f component banks do. That is why finger prints or palm prints are used, rather than you placing a fake cut-out photo of Jake the Snake in front of a camera on an bitcoin ATM.
The guy with the Lamassu machine in Alburquerque surely has better things to do than ID people using his machine. Giving him a hard time sucks. He is providing a service to people who choose to use it. Staying out of jail is a serious issue for those prepared to take on various initiatives.
I listened to a Lamassu rep (as I recall) talking about a situation where operators of one of their machines ceased to operate in 2013 because on compliance issues. Their investment sat idle collecting dust somewhere in America.

In the case of Robocoin, they are rebranding. The notion of full KYC/AML without a bank is foreign to people. People are used to getting all the initial formalities done at a bank. 2-way Bitcoin machines are now doing the whole process without entering a bank. The initial formality takes the longest. Transactions are quicker once the initial verification is complete in both cases, whether traditional bank or 2-way BTC/cash machine.

That is because: Marketing. D0gecoin went big on the spam and tip-to-vest marketing aspect and it has worked. Part of the marketing involves using derogatory terms towards ppl involved with bitcoin (rather than the banks in the case of bitcoin!). This marketing aspect is wise because of the easy conversion to d0gecoins from bitcoins.
Just as bitcoins were given out in the early days to get people involved, interested and VESTED. D0gecoin marketers did not come up with tip-to-vest marketing first.

Some people don't buy in the first place due to the high price. I've heard this too many times. People who have bitcoins or bits already may not understand the concept. It is a foreign perception others may have. This is where altcoins can shine. Marketing and perception accounts for a lot.

I don't blame some ppl for viewing altcoins as nothing more than a rip-off of Bitcoin. The early adopters went through a lot of shit (the ones who were vocal). I've been watching from the sidelines since 2010, maybe 2009? I also know the psychology of wanting to have a moon ride like the early adopters have had already. Without bitcoin, d0gecoin would not have the the moon marketing aspect (or exist for that matter). I have d0gecoin and other altcoins myself, FWIW, but I'm not into fooling myself or others that I don't care about the price. That would be disingenuous of me. ppl are ppl and I have d0gecoins due to the aggressive marketing d0gecoin fans are doing to try and pump the coin (because they are not marketing for the fun of it I'm sure, unless they have very dull lives!)

"I operate a Lamassu kiosk and while the manufacturer has recently developed software enhancements to comply with KYC/AML regulations, I have chosen not to implement them. Yeah, my ass is on the line here, but I've used the Robocoin machine and felt it was very intrusive. I like the idea of anonymity and I don't want to have to keep records of my customers' identities and monitor their private transactions. That's not Satoshi's way, nor is it mine. So far, I'm operating well under the radar and I'm not very worried about it (though some attorneys have warned me that I am taking a huge risk by following this path). I have a FinCen license, but there are no final state licensing regulations (yet), so until they tell me what I have to do to stay out of jail, I will continue to operate my machine as it was shipped, without collecting personal information from the users. The only "compliance" feature I've turned on so far is a maximum transaction limit of $500 USD. This is partly to avoid having to file Suspicious Activity Reports, but mainly to keep me from running out of bitcoins on a daily basis." - by Magg0tt (reddit user)

This is unhealthy situation sucks. I did not celebrate when the hash rate dropped a day ago to 36% or whatever. This is now all too predictable. This is where Bitcoin is losing out and the door potentially opens for….a superior safer coin.

"Because Bitcoin is something that was invented in 2008, and if you look at things that were invented in 2008 of course what we have today in 2014 is better. Better smart phones, better tablets, better apps, better software and there has been a lot of improvement, a lot of thought in the crypto currency world since Bitcoin came out, and so today there are more than a hundred different cryptocurrencies……" - David Seaman

Jordan has seemingly screwed ppl around. If he redeems himself somehow…then good on him. A couple of posters on this forum came to believe I "love Robocoin" due to posts I've made concerning the boring facts about the company and operators of the machines. My posts stuck out and some ppl resented them like member storms brewing. Being accused of following the playbook is super ironic.

One thing to keep in mind. 'Satoshi Nakamoto' started out with the experiment that is still ongoing. If it were not for the positivity of many of the early adopters…..there would be no crypto coins. People can be quick to shit on the early adopters…but I disagree. They have taken a lot of flack over the years. Bitcoins did not even have a price for the first 6 months or so. How times have changed. Now people talk about "to the moon"….. because some already made it.

It is now no where near is as much as it has been in the past. I think there may have been a move on r/bitcoin to cut some of it out?. Can I give you a percentage of the threads and posts? sorry no. But the dogecoin reference is ubiquitous throughout the threads and sometimes it is derogatory. I am just a regular guy whom has followed bitcoin for years. I watched the early adopters get blasted years ago. I was not prepared to take the financial risk myself. Now people resent the early adopters for sitting on lots of coins (the ones who didn't "throw them away"). I don't like references to being "serious" and "as this is humorous, it is really a dogecoin thing". I ended up getting resenting this. Bitcoin is the battering ram through shit and sun, that is still forging the way.  The crap on r/bitcoin mainly comes from dogecoin fans (I'm not kidding - you might see some jabs in the ribs from Litecoin fans but nothing else worth mentioning from what I've seen) r/bitcoin is an obvious target but I listened to an interview recently where a self proclaimed dogecoin spammer described that he had spammed heaps of subreddits and annoyed a lot of people with plenty of bannings across reddit. Some Dogecoin fans have demonstrated the power of spam. I now realise why companies persist with it. I also know a small business owner who says it works. Spamming is a money making tool. Quark was another coin that generated some spammers. Dogecoin has some serious investors within it along with many new people to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been going for years…it has a wide diversity of people. The early adopters took more risks and took way more shit than any of us are today. They have assisted to create the cryptocurrency space. Now many people resent them (but want their own climb to the moon) Peace :-)

From memory, I seem to recall one of the Lamassu company representatives talking about a case where a Lamassu machine purchased in 2013 had not been in operation for about 6 months or so due to the operator deciding not to risk non-compliance with KYC/AML regs. This is in America. The guy in the cigar shop in Albuquerque was not taking peoples details down for the fun of it. Manufacturers of bitcoin "ATMs" don't include features just to annoy people. That is bad business practice.
There is surely a logical reason why American bitcoin to cash trading exchanges have/are taking so long to eventuate, whereas other exchanges have functioned around the world. Americans have to consider compliances if they want to stay out of jail.

The marketing and spamming works. Being friendly works. I regard the bitcoin community as friendly. I've seen people cop a lot of flack for believing in bitcoin years ago. These people forged the way, and I respect that. I'm not into bullshit about 1 doge = 1 doge and "we don't care about the price" talk I've seen. "Shibes" &amp; "Bitcoiners" are not terms I like at all. Dogecoin does not get the full brunt of bad PR from the drug dealers, politics and so forth. Bitcoin gets attacked from every angle, and people tire from it no doubt. If dogecoin was to gain "moon" results price wise along the lines of bitcoin path from obscurity, the gains would go to plenty of peoples heads. At the moment it is about recruiting and vesting. The bitcoin geeks and early adopters surely have quite high levels of intelligence for doing as they have done thus far. It can be frustrating and tiresome, having to continuously guide others who don't bother to read up on Satoshi's white paper and the basics of this new invention in cryptography.

Life is tough. Yesterday I worked in a professional capacity with a certain  group of individuals. They take certain medications that I regard, mainly serve just slowly kill them. The original papers that lead to these medications eventually being used for this set of patients are fraudulent. Even though those papers are fraudulent, a massive industry has emerged and it is a huge scientific tangled mess as a result.
….lots to say but….due to the popular perception of the situation, a less than ideal situation is what it is, and the patients and wider community want the particular medications. I'm not prepared to possibly lose my job by speaking out, but I try to assist with education and perception a little behind the scenes via the internet and talking with various people away from the work situation. I have challenged strategically with the workplace, but I'm not prepared to go all out. I have to "suck it up", and be realistic about the situation and perception.

I actually started a thread on the subject here on r/bitcoin a week or two ago. I've currently reached the conclusion, bitcoin/cryptos give the dealer more anonymity that cash. Prior to that, I had not thought deeply about it and would just say "bitcoin is just digital cash" in the context of a conversation with someone whom knows little about bitcoin but has heard about the drug dealer aspect via the media. The wider drug debate is a huge one…and one I'm not well researched on. Via my work and personal experiences, I see the fall out though and know how they can negatively impact peoples lives.

One of the main aspects of Bitcoin is that you store your own coins.
When I have coins at an exchange, it is glaringly obvious that the could close at any moment. Thus, I am prepared to lose the coins. I keep things to a minimum.
You neglected to do something that is core to Bitcoin. Eric Voorhees was smart enough to blame himself for his loss of 550 BTC at Mt.Gox. He advises others to store their coins themselves, yet he was too lazy and careless to follow his own advice. Bitcoin is not for everyone. If you are not prepared to store your own coins, I would suggest that you should not be involved. In the future, businesses will set up options for people but these will pose a risk.

I would suggest, you film yourself (good quality audio/HD) simply addressing common criticisms about Bitcoin. 
Have some one voice over the criticism first then you address it.
The problem with the Schiff vs Vorhees debate was that Vorhees did not bring many of the good points about bitcoin into the debate (at the time). His open letter afterwards to Peter Schiff was better than the content of the debate. Vorhees needed time to think things over later without being caught up in the frustrations of a live debate situation. Schiff talks and debates within the media every week and thus has practice.

Lol, marketing is an art, and Jackson Palmer is a marketer. I view dogecoin as very sophisticated. Much mores than Bitcoin when it comes to marketing. Dogecoin marketing is spammy, aggressive and takes no prisoners. I fully respect this and have dogecoins due to it. Even though it is denied, there are plenty of posts and threads that have a negative bias towards bitcoin on r/d0gecoin. I will go there now…….. found two infighting threads on the first 'hot' page.
Expected to find at least one thread that is derogatory towards bitcoin rather than banks or more traditional payment methods like Western Union or PayPal. I had to  go back to the 3rd 'hot' page to find a thread.
The theme of bashing bitcoin users is reasonably prevalent. I've seen heaps of threads dedicated to the cause. I think Jackson Palmer got the theme rolling.

1/2 an hour? - It took me around 18 minutes to get full KYC/AML verification - I was not that quick at using the machine. Once your account is set up, the subsequent transactions happen briskly like any other machine. If an operator decides to implement the optional KYC/AML utilities on the machine, not Robocoin.
The machine is basically like a bank except you don't walk into the bank and get verified by a bank employee visually observing your facial biometric against photo ID. It takes time to set-up the "bank account" with Robocoin. If you need to take a snack with you when you set up an account at a bank, then perhaps you should do so when setting up an account with the Robocoin machine. Setting an account up with the Robocoin machine probably takes a little less time than the experience at a bank though.

The most creepy form of ID is surely visual physical facial and bodily recognition (your gait). Governments use this form of ID first and foremost. You are trackable where ever cameras can take your data. Finger prints are something you leave behind, thus governments use this biometric also. Why? ..because it is of use to track ppl. Especially ppl in law enforcement circles. Govt's are not stupid. Vein scans whether of a finger or the palm are not trackable by the govts usual means. The palm vein scan on the Robocoin manufactured machines is something the operator implements. Robocoin machines don't require the scan in order to operate. It is up to the operator. Bitcoiniacs in Canada turned the palm scan and other KYC functions off. It is their choice, not Robocoin's. So if Robocoin has an agenda (you need to explain why there is no need for a palm vein scan if the operator decides). When you go to a bank, the teller matches your visual facial biometric with photo ID in order to make sure they are dealing with the correct human. It takes time to set up an account at first. Because, ppl can hold a fake photo up to a machine, machines like Genesis1, Diamond Circle, Robocoin, Bitxatm, BTCpoint and Bit2Bit provide optional scans for operators. These may include finger prints, palm vein scans or other! I highly doubt you suspect an agenda with Coinbase, Mt Gox (in it's day) or Bitstamp. Yet these companies have ppl's photo IDs!
Ppl are not used to the notion of palm vein scans. What you probably don't realise is that you are likely being tracked by your photo ID as it is.  You are less trackable by finger prints…and then palm vein pattern. The truth of the matter is obviously difficult to comprehend for many ppl.
If you don't want to be tracked. You need to work on the main means first. Photo IDs! hmm!

Absolutely, Bitcoin is an invention within the realms of cryptology. People should do their own research and decide for themselves.
Bitcoin is decentralised for a reason. MtGox is centralised. 
MtGox is not Bitcoin.
Tomcar is a company that uses bitcoins over the Bitcoin payment network, to save themselves over $50,000 AUD in transaction fees.
This company does not speculate with bitcoins. It just utilises the cheaper utility within the business. The monies saved are diverted into other aspects that benefit the company.

You are doing away with going into a bank and identifying yourself to them and creating an account at that bank. The machine does the same thing but gets around the f2f/photo ID aspect. The first time you go into a bank and set up your account it takes time. When you go in for transactions after that, you don't have to go through the hoops as much because they know who you are. The 2-way machines with compliance measures do the same thing. Most people are prepared to go through the motions to set up a bank account with a bank. These machines present a new way of bypassing that in bank encounter, but it is a foreign concept to people like you.

"Super religious" - Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen rightfully sights bitcoin as an experiment (if I recall correctly). Bitcoin could live or die. People like Andreas Antonopolous view that Bitcoin could fail, although the invention in tech will live on. It provides an alternative to the worlds banking system. This alone is enough incentive for me to give it some support.
The purchaser of a mining rig is taking on the risk and potential reward the machine may afford. The rig manufacturer is turning over rigs and thus developing further rigs due to the business model and timely income flow.

Are you from BitPOS? My payment was very slow to "confirm". The guy at the cafe was watching a green line move across to confirm the transaction. It got to about 90% and then stopped…so we waited. I waited a minute or two (not my style!!). He ended up asking me if I don't mind waiting. Luckily I was not in a hurry. I ended giving him my mobile phone number in case he wanted to call me about the transaction. The green 'confirm' line on his tablet did not complete whilst I was there.

AA is focused on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and speaks about them mores than anyone else I am aware of. He is smart, tech savvy and articulate. Many ppl find what he has to say worth listening too. Because he is continuously presenting around the world, his presentations are going to pop up over and over. Especially since he is reaching various audiences. He is someone ppl new to bitcoin should listen to IMHO. Perhaps you should ask AA to stop presenting soo much, or encourage someone else (or yourself) or multiple others to present more than AA each in their own right. This way you will surely see less posts featuring AA.

He lost his BTC but knew the risk at wobbling Mt Gox (so he did not cry). Greed played a part. Human risk behaviour. There were enough warning and ppl should not have "given" MK all those bitcoins to mind for them. MK did not act alone. Many in the bitcoin community financed the monstrosity themselves.

The actual Robocoin ATM does not require your ID and palm vein scan unless the operator sets it up that way. Like various other Bitcoin ATMs, it is up to the operator as to whether or not KYC and AML are implemented. 
Here is an informational list I put together to try and educate the people involved with Bitcoin.
(copied and pasted)
Boring facts: If the operator enables full KYC measures on this machine, you will be setting up an account (at the machine rather than at a traditional bank branch). The machine is really a 'branch' in this case, as the Robocoin company have termed it. Part of the process when setting up an account is to scan the hand four times in order for the machine to capture your palm vein pattern sufficiently. The next time you use the machine it will require you scan your palm once.
The operator of the machine may decide not to enable the KYC and AML features, thus the same machine may not require a palm scan at all. The machine is capable of anon transactions. It is up to the operator of the machine. The Robocoin machine run by Bitcoiniacs at Waves Coffee in Canada has been giving ppl anon transactions.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.
* atm4coin         1W &amp; 2W Open source project..ongoing. Machine availability?
* Bit-Wallet         1W &amp; 2W No KYC functions.
* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. POS functionality including staff tips feature.
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.
* BTCpoint          2W KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* Coinoutlet         2W KYC/AML options (operators decide) ID scan if required. Accepts altcoins if configured. Online shopping module.
* Coinplug           2W AML feature (not known if optional) KYC? (Korean) 
* Diamond Circle  2W Visa/MC not cash. KYC (via bank CCs) and AML variances for operators.
* Genesis1          2W Optional fingerprint reader/gov ID &amp; bank card reader for operators. Lite/Doge too
* Localbitcoins ATM 2W Nil KYC features.
* Robocoin          2W Optional ID scan/palm vein scan/camera &amp; optional AML feature for operators.

Tough luck for Bitcoin, ……yet do The Bitcoin Foundation give a shit or have any sort of vetting process.
As I've said before, what next….Gavin Andresen turns out to be a gun runner operating through HSBC and SR?.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is dealing with bugs from 18 months ago, has only one paid dev (I think) and has no professional type PR thing happening.

1) The Robocoin palm scan is optional (see link). **It depends on the operator of the machine. Robocoin simply gives the operator a biometric option**. The operator decides and it will depend on what country and the potential KYC/AML regs:  Governments oversee KYC/AML regulations. Banks use photo ID and have the benefit of the face to face encounter. If not, they restrict, as per their ATMs with their transactions limits. Robocoin machines bypass entering a bank and setting up an account. In both cases (bank or Robocoin machine) setting up the account for the first time, takes longer than subsequent everyday transactions.


3) Robocoin provides the machines. Ultimately, Robocoin operators provides a services you can choose to use. Like Bitcoin, we are not forced use Robocoin just like we are not forced to sign up to BitPay and have them take down our details. Robocoin does not intrude on other routes into Bitcoin. I purchased my first bitcoins face to face with a stranger. I would surely be less likely to want to do that if I was female. Robocoin machines potentially offer unbanked females (especially) with a safe entry option into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Yes, and some forum members are admitting to their greed. Mt.Gox offered the highest fiat returns for BTC. I know of someone whom was tentatively trying to get funds out via USD. The risk is obvious and has been for long time. I decided to use alternatives. Mt.Gox was not worth the risk. At the end of the day…trust no one with your coins. Store them on your owns wallets.

I don't follow the playbook, that is why you have been confused. I bothered to research Robocoin and other manufacturers a little. My comments have gone against the grain, because the playbook would dictate that I should be negative and should exaggerate when it comes to companies like Robocoin whom provide machines that are capable of taking ID and biometric detail. The playbook says I should make negative commentary and make negative statements in regards to anything that takes IDs ETC. This is why my posts stuck out and you remember me because I did not sing along with any chorus. The irony here.
Mt Gox took IDs and many companies require IDs and biometric data. I have provided a list of manufacturers of various Bitcoin ATMs and show how various companies offer operators choices.
Personally, I would rather my government and businesses keep their noses out of my life. My govt has my photo and iris scan (jail entry) at the very least. I'm also probably on my govts watch list due to things I've been involved in (and perhaps still are due to my research into the occult societies that I make public).
I realise, that despite my own preferences for anon transactions and other things humanity could possibly embrace, I have to live in the real world to a certain degree. Having been in jails for various reasons, I don't want to see others going there. This may be difficult to comprehend.
Please show me one post I've made that is somehow promotive of Robocoin as some great company. - NOT GONNA HAPPEN, Lol.
Here is a post I made a few weeks back: "Jordan has dug Robocoin a grave. I hope you are fully compensated."

There is another aspect to this, that Adam Back talked about. If Bitcoin fails and another coin takes over, we may go into paradigm where each coin is looking over it's shoulder at the next one. ppl will lose trust as each coin goes in and out of fashion as the waves come through. We may end up having thousands of coins…..think about it! It is an interesting notion….no scarcity and poor ecosystems. Many ppl surely want to see a strong force that can take on the banks that have screwed ppl around in so many ways. Crypto may end up being a vast see of continuous coins with various names and marketing mechanisms. Some of us have motivations beyond just filling our pockets. I certainly do. I've donated lots of my time and energy to things for other ppl that cost me financially.

If r/dogecoin was spammed just as r/bitcoin is spammed by r/dogecoin fans, I'd think the spam would be banned. Spamming works, and people want coin prices to rise, just as bitcoin showed us.

Bitcoin is NOT Mt.Gox &amp; Mt.Gox is NOT Bitcoin. Bitcoin existed before Mt.Gox and will exist after Mt.Gox. It is so screwed up that people think Mt.Gox is somehow Bitcoin!!!!!. What a f*cking joke. Yes, Mt.Gox has assisted the progression of Bitcoin but the scale of what has possibly happened is insane.
I'm aware of a guy who took the risk with Mt.Gox due to the higher premiums….it has not paid off. I've come across a couple of others whom admit to greed and risking it via Mt.Gox. Closr to 7% of the currency may have been 'lost' or whatever. It is a disaster.
Bitcoin is decentralised…….don't trust third parties with your coins unless you don't mind losing them. I'm frustrated that so many bitcoins were sitting at an exchange of all places collecting dust and are now lost. The situation was insane……and there was a lack of oversight from all involved. Personally, I did not take the risk with Mt.Gox even though others were going for those higher premiums when cashing out. I've come across a two reddit members whom admit to greed and thus using Mt.Gox.

Mt.Gox was not a bank and why people trusted Mark Karpeles with their coins is beyond me.

Hi ya, I made this vid. The Electrum wallet (AKA "client") is a great wallet to start out with.
Write down the 'seed' and keep in a couple of safe places. Use a strong password.
GreenAddress.it is another promising system (link the desktop and mobile/same pvt key).
Bitcoin is an ongoing experiment. The tech is getting easier to use, but still has a long way to go.
Take the time to learn about wallets and refrain from 'storing your coins' with online companies.
Ultimately, you want to control the pvt key to your coins.

“It was important for us to give operators the choice of one-way or two-way transactions,” says Zach Harvey, CEO of Lamassu. “Our modular design allows them the ability to choose a cash-to-Bitcoin machine, or the option of adding a stand that enables two-way transactions. Different operators have different market needs, so flexibility is key here.”

It actually potentially replaces a the KYC/AML aspects of a bank branch. Thus, you no longer have to be physically present at a traditional bank with photo ID and other papers to set up an account in this case. It depends on how the operator of the machine configures it though, not Robocoin. It has full KYC/AML features but they are optional. Bitcoiniacs in Canada have operated their machine with the KYC/AML features both on and off. The manufacture now markets these machines as 'branches' rather than ATMs. Traditional bank branches provide more than these machines though, because you can go to a bank branch and set up car or house loans etc. These machines can't do those things. These machines sit in-between ATMs and traditional bank branches, IMO.

I've read enough stories of people waiting around at bricks and mortar venues waiting for a bitcoin transaction to get 1 confirm. I don't want to do that. I would use cash or CC instead (no question).
If I'm selling goods, I want payment for them and can understand various retailers feeling anxious at having an unconfirmed transaction.
I don't regard zero conf as secure? Paint this grey area as you will. Some people want secure. Some companies are problem solving. These companies provide myself and others with an option (we as peers can choose to utilise) for near instant confirmed payments. Want it? Use it. Don't want it? Use wallets you want to use. No one is taking from the other. Have both …whatever.

The double-spend issue via Bitundo or other bricks and mortar establishments may mean there is a requirement for third parties like GreenAddress, Coinkite, Bitpay and others to give retailers the assurance  they need. Pay and go. Payments made in seconds. That is what is required for busy bricks and mortar businesses.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:19:15
I'm glad to see the threat of a double spend being addressed by Robocoin giving POS retailers complete confidence (the article alludes to this, so…?). I support GreenAddress also for innovating via their multi-sig wallets and giving POS retailers assurance a double spend won't happen via their GreenAddress wallets.

Robocoin 'branches' is a better term (not perfect, but…) than ATM. The machines have confused people. They replace the need for sign up at a traditional bank branch. Full KYC/ALM functions can be activated if the operators of the Robocoin machines choose to implement them.

Some operators of "Bitcoin ATMs" don't want to be party to any "money laundering. 
KYC/AML: Various governments make people jump through hoops or they send them to jail. Some govts legislate in order to track various money flows.

People generally have to pay for services. If both parties have internet access and don't want to trade out of bitcoins then they have no need for extra services. Just because people are poor does not mean other people should supply free services to them. If the service saves the people money, they will likely use it. If it is more expensive, they won't willingly feed the "vultures." Would you? Further competing companies can potentially bring further savings in time. Once BitPesa sorts out it's initial costs, it too may be able to bring prices down. That is the free-market at work.
Anything positive about Bitcoin?

Nope, those whom trusted Mark Karpeles to "store their bitcoins" are at the root of the problem. The Mt.Gox collapse should have been negligible event due to the loss of a minimal amount of coins used to trade by active traders. Mt.Gox is not a magic bitcoin bank. Bitcoin 101 = a decentralised system with individuals protecting their funds via their own wallets and backed up private keys.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:58:37
…increasing market failure has pissed many people off, with the GHash example getting worse. We have miners on here now explaining why GHash is where it is at for them. People are now looking for solutions. I want decentralised and Bitcoin has recently been centralised (sure, most pple prob don't care for decentralised). My faith has waned. My video efforts to assist the ecosystem, my invested monies, my assistance to get friends involved, my donations to charities and purchases with bits…. I've invested in bitcoin but centralisation is going to make me break my ties. Hard to leave when I've put energy into assisting…..lets see how this plays out.

You need to research wallets. If a centralised third party controls your coins, they are not really yours. If the third party goes out of business, you can't access your coins. This is Bitcoin 101. Have your own wallet.

Compliance: This is surely why Lamassu machines are not scattered all over the US for example.
1) The operators can act as a kind of bank teller and take ppls IDs, so they need to monitor the machine (in their shop/cafe or where ever). 
2) Another thing they could do is potentially limit the daily amount of dollar conversion so that it no one can go above a certain daily limit on the operators machine/s. 
3)The operator can take a risk….the operator could potentially be set up by ppl from an agency (FBI….undercover govt operatives...etc) whom convert of the local AML limit. Sellers on LocalBitcoins have run into trouble along these lines:

I don't appreciate that the miners have given them the chance in the first place. Most people work hard for their money, and don't want hiccups, but nothing is perfect. I'm not blaming anyone though, we all have our needs and wants. I want decentralisation. 
I'm somewhat distanced of mainstream societal thinking. The sign in the Black Rose Anarchist Bookshop front window today here in Sydney was designed and built by me around 15 years ago. I'm not part of the ongoing collective and never was, FWIW. 
If Bitcoin continues not to provide….I will hopefully find decentralisation in a currency elsewhere. It has been the biggest drawcard of Bitcoin for me. Such is life.

( SN's code aside) If bitcoin is not something I can walk into a brick and mortar store and pay of something with and walk out (post a reasonably quick transaction with no waiting about longer than 20 -25 sec absolute max), it severely restricts it's utility, and thus value IMHO.

I doubt Reddcoin tipping has been banned on r/bitcoin. The main tipping motive is obvious enough. During my times spent reading the r/dogecoin subreddit I've not noticed continuous infiltration/spam/tips from other coins like Reddcoin. r/dogecoin certainly has it's fair share of threads with commentary that is negative towards r/bitcoin, and find the derogatory talk regrettable. I feel that it has become part of the marketing. 
There are heaps of smart tech people on this subreddit for sure. It can be tough going for a non-geek like me. Lots of trolls are attracted to this sub, and people can be rude at times. I'm not perfect. I'm human, and come across as rude at times too. I'm later to the game than others, so I well aware of the altcoin "to da moon" mentality. I have dogecoin amoung other altcoins. 
Spamming/'tipping to vest' has been prevalent on this subreddit from one coin well above all others. r/dogecoin marketing can be aggressive thus, Reddcoin tipping was banned. No mucking around with srz moon bznz. That is why have some dogecoins.
I followed bitcoin from the early days. Did not vest in it (magic internet money!). Bitcoin has gone to the moon already for some in spectacular fashion. They took a much higher risk than we do now. Without their foundation and SN's we would not have these coins. No one has had to forge their way through the negativity like the early adopters have. I thank them for staying positive. Without that, we would not be having a conversation. Just saying..peace
*added - I cringe at Bitcoin Lol, it is this ongoing experiment and people like me who "anarchic" don't do marketing very well :-) …some others are doing a good job here and there. Dogecoin does not have the wider things going on that bitcoin does, so more focus on marketing I'd think.

The aging population, where vast reserves of cash are, struggle to turn on a computer let alone create a bitcoin wallet. 2. too many bitcoin fanatics are holding on to there precious coin waiting for that "to the moon" moment to arrive. If they were really interested in seeing a true value accumulate they would be spending their bitcoins like crazy and demanding that merchants/vendors accept it. too much need for regulation which defeats the purpose and value of bitcoin. so as for me I see a steady drop back down to the sub-dollar and then poof as interest continues to wane." - Mcfattius

The operators of the machines have to decide. The operators of the Robocoin machines decide whether or not they utilise the KYC/AML options on the machine. Location and KYC/AML factors should be considered. Staying out of jail, should be of prime concern for operators. The rest of us don't have to worry so much.
Transactions become much faster on the Robocoin machines once the initial KYC part is done. Setting yourself up with a traditional bank account takes longer the first time as the bank gets to know you. The transactions after that are faster. Same thing.
"Some ATMs (I think Robocoin ones) may use webcam to get user photos, scan ID documents or even taking finger prints. The lamassu vending machines don't give those rich functions, and sometimes the data collecting function becomes crazy, e.g. for the recently installed lamassu ATM in Albuquerque - the owner of the cigar bar was sitting near the machine and collecting personal data of people who bought bitcoins using his laptop." - source:

That is for the market to decide. No one is forced to use the machines.

When Bitcoin started it's journey, they were given away and had no buying power against anything. How times have changed. There was no exchange until Mt.Gox came along and some price discovery really came to be. I have dogecoins and they are worth quite a lot in total. I have a lot of satoshis too. Many people have invested in bitcoin, litecoin, peercoin, dogecoin, blackcoin etc. The price of each unit is irrelevant (you just get more or less for the same fiat, whoop de do!). Price appreciation in the coins is what most people are looking for. There is some very serious money invested in dogecoins. Many people want more "to da moon". I'm a nice enough guy, I want some moon too!. Early adopters in Bitcoin may have laid out $20 or $30 dollars in the early days to find them selves now able to buy a lambo or a trip to space with Virgin Galactic. Good for them. Too bad for guys who threw hard drives out because bitcoins were not worth anything, or next to nothing. Bitcoin reached the moon and all the rest IMO, amazing, and that is why the moon is now part of the vocab in cryptos. People have been amazed. 
I'm quite anti the banking system and wish to see positive change. I thank the early risk takers and devs who had and have a positive attitude and made Bitcoin what it is today, and subsequent coins. We can thank 'Satoshi Nakamoto' for the invention of the blockchain that is the core of the coins we now appreciate. SN = the coin.

I use the service provider Coinjar which is similar to Coinbase. I keep my coins there for a minimum amount of time. I was locked out of the BTC-e exchange for two weeks via 2FA. I don't keep large amounts of coins that I'm not prepared to lose at centralised third parties. I take almost any opportunity to warn others even after Mt.Gox has assisted the cause lately. People are too used to relying on traditional banks. They now confuse bitcoin service providers with banks. People should use wallets only they have access to.

Bitcoin was adopted by techy nerds, anarchist types, entrepreneurs, libertarians and many others. As the price rises have kept going, more and more people have jumped in on the band-wagon especially in search of "to da moon" action. This includes me in part. In the early days, no one had any idea Bitcoin was going to make the huge rises in price it has.
Referring to these people as assholes is an interesting perspective. I was not prepared to take the time and risk in the early days…but I take my hat off to those who did, and have built things up to a point where the tech is improved and I'm more confident in being part of the Bitcoin and the further cryptocurrencies that would not exist if it was not for the early adopters.

2 way - Another 2-way bitcoin ATM uses a finger print.A guy with a Lamassu machine in Albuquerque resorted to taking down people IDs at the machine in order to be able to operate it with out the threat of jail time. The Robocoin palm scan is optional, it can be turned off if the operator wants. The operator can turn it off but it is a matter of compliance - KYC/AML. Banks see you in person and photo ID is used to identify when required. Regular ATMs have daily restrictions on withdrawal amounts. Women especially may not want to meet up with strangers to cash in or out of bitcoins. But hey, lets get rid of these 2-way KYC/AML compliant machines, because we are too hard.

I don't particularly like or dislike Robocoin's branches. I just let ppl know the boring facts rather than exaggerate shit and provide disinformation.
The Robocoin machine run by Bitcoiniacs in Canada requires no ID. It is an anon transaction. The operator of the machine decides, not Robocoin. Could you explain Robocoin's philosophy as it regards to their machines being able to conduct anonymous transactions. Answer: NO
Robocoin provides a machine that can enact anonymous transactions! The operator decides though. 










Do you regard the philosophy of these businesses as fundamentally opposed to the philosophy of bitcoin? Are you out opposing these companies when Robocoin machines actually allow operators to provide anonymous transaction via the machine to customers….when Coinbase for example does not!

Um?? KYC is f*cking joke imposed on almost everyone except the likes of HSBC, Wachovia, Wells Fargo and many other banks around the world (who get a slap on the wrist). Ppl should be able to do as they please with their money. If I trigger AML red flags at my bank, I'd prefer to tell them to f*ck off and mind their own business. The problem is, I've been to jail as a visitor (had my iris scanned) and don't want to go to jail and serve time myself. I don't want others to go their either. Jail time is f*cked up, but govts have force. I'm no advocate for KYC. 
Anyone using Mt.Gox (when running), Coinbase, BitPay, Bitstamp, Coinjar or Circle and many others is complying with KYC regulation either fully or in part. Is this what bitcoin is about??? Bitcoin is different things to different ppl. Ppl generally don't want to be "criminals."
I don't like the fact the government can track my transactions via Coinjar but that is reality at the moment. I transact in various ways mind you.
I did my tax at an office yesterday and perhaps did not declare a lot of shit like most ppl surely do. F*ck em basically. My return will be converted to non-govt issued things like bitcoin and precious metals.
The very post that you have replied to shows celebrates how Kenyans can use M-Pesa to get around Kenyan banks and into bitcoin. But hey..never mind the cold hard facts of reality. You confuse my talking about the facts with some sort of promotion, Lol. You are a complete f*cking turd.

Ya, Bitcoin is controversial and potentially threatening to certain enterprises. The spot light is on Bitcoin somewhat. The knives are out. Expect to get hung, drawn and quartered if you are involved with bitcoins rather than the HSBC for example. But is this not common god damn sense. Nope, not in Bitcoin Lala land. If a celebrity is caught shop lifting, it is all over the MSM. If I was to get caught shop lifting, the MSM would not care. In this case the MSM wants article views and ad revenue.

The operators of the machines have to decide. The operators of the Robocoin machines decide whether or not they utilise the KYC/AML options on the machine. Location and KYC/AML factors should be considered. Staying out of jail, should be of prime concern for operators. The rest of us don't have to worry so much.
"Some ATMs (I think Robocoin ones) may use webcam to get user photos, scan ID documents or even taking finger prints. The lamassu vending machines don't give those rich functions, and sometimes the data collecting function becomes crazy, e.g. for the recently installed lamassu ATM in Albuquerque - the owner of the cigar bar was sitting near the machine and collecting personal data of people who bought bitcoins using his laptop." - source:

I stayed clear of the Mt.Gox exchange for reasons that are slightly more obvious now. Keeping coins on the Mt.Gox exchange was not clever, IMHO.
I trade on exchanges. It is obvious that the exchanges can be hacked or shut down at any moment for whatever reason (you name it). If I lose the coins I have on the exchange, I'm not going to be sad. The risk is obvious and I'm willing to take it like some others. I don't leave lots of coins sitting at exchanges though. They belong in my wallets to which I have exclusive access.

They accept bits. If you have travelled from the Beijing for example to Vulcan Tires and only have bits, you can pay them in bits. You don't require another currency. They receive the bits and BitPay converts the bits to USD if Vulcan Tires wants this. Bitcoin is young, a tiny market and volatile. Businesses will generally want a more reliable currency, and something that people who they owe bills to accept.

By the time you even get to this machine, you will have potentially been tracked via the most intrusive form of ID. You mug shot! Govt's are not stupid when it comes to ID. They also use finger prints which one may leave behind. Interestingly, walking gaits can be tracked too.

I doubt anybody wants your DNA! DNA is not required for KYC/AML measures. Proof of the person being present is though. Thus finger print scans, finger vein scans or palm vein scans may be required. Banks have the capacity to see you in person against photo ID. KYC/AML compliant machines don't have the benefit of the human to human experience banks staff do.
You mention the palm scan. Do you realise the CEO is a libertarian!. The Robocoin machines provide optional KYC/AML measures that the operators decide whether to implement or not. The machine is more than an ATM. It replaces the need for a bricks and mortar bank when it comes to KYC/AML compliance! This is what many people can't seem to comprehend.

Bitcoin also represents a system devoid of government which can be an emotional aspect also for some people. Humans have emotions.

**I've conversed with members of the public whom don't get passed the "drugs" aspect**
Bitcoin is always going to be under threat because something like only 1000 people own about half the bitcoins thus far released, thus large market dumps could happen shaking the price (correct me if i'm wrong). Poor wealth distribution.
Other neg issues: Bitcoin is too expensive for people. Bitcoin is not marketed well. Poor image especially via "drug dealers" and money laundering types. Bitcoin could get swallowed up by better marketed future players with less SResk taint.

Various online exchanges want IDs too. Mt.Gox was an example. Understanding why can be a little difficult. Especially for those who are not business entrepreneurs or working professions that require high responsibilities.
2 way - Another 2-way bitcoin ATM uses a finger print.A guy with a Lamassu machine in Albuquerque resorted to taking down people IDs at the machine in order to be able to operate it with out the threat of jail time. The Robocoin palm scan is optional, it can be turned off if the operator wants. The operator can turn it off but it is a matter of compliance - KYC/AML. Banks see you in person and photo ID is used to identify when required. Regular ATMs have daily restrictions on withdrawal amounts. Women especially may not want to meet up with strangers to cash in or out of bitcoins. But hey, lets get rid of these 2-way KYC/AML compliant machines, because we are too hard.

The Robocoin palm scan is optional. It depends on the operator of the machine. Robocoin simply gives the biometric option. The operator decides and it will depend on what country and the potential KYC/AML regs: 
Governments oversee KYC/AML regulations.

Bitcoin is not designed for bricks and mortar institutions. It is better suited to the internet environment. Payments and micro-payments with very low transaction fees can be made. You really need to find some better sources to learn about the Bitcoin payment network.
Bitcoin is not perfect, nor is it competing with perfect. Decentralisation has benefits and drawbacks (currently). You demand the best of both worlds…..did your parents spoil you?  ..maybe Ripple is more to your liking?

Wow, that is a great initiative!. I also think exchanges should advise people not to store excess amounts of coins on "any exchange" or at any third party (it is basic 'Satoshi Nakamoto' education - just get the wording right so as not to cast inappropriate doubt). People can be lazy, as Eric Voorhess admitted regarding his 550 BTC at Mt.Gox. Exchanges are not a bank….and one stores bitcoins in a wallet. Do we store our life savings in a wallet???? (let us keep some perspective). Another thing exchanges could do to assist the ecosystem is to advise clients not to purchase goods from retailers via the exchange wallet. The reason is that exchanges may not release the coins straight away, and some retailers demand the coins are paid in quick and timely fashion. Times too fast for exchanges to release the funds. I hope the Buttercoin venture goes well BTW.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:21:21
Know one thing: Bitcoin is about not trusting third parties with your dosh so get with the ethic and follow my tutorial for the Electrum wallet:

Even though I have used unconfirmed transactions to buy things...a level of trust was required. It should not be like this. I've had a cafe assistant looking at me going...this is unconfirmed!....So, ultimately I would agree. Bitcoin is too slow (anything over about 4-5 seconds is too slow IMHO). Things need to happen quickly as they do with credit cards (at least). It is that damn simple. Competition. GreenAddress had/has? wallets supporting near instant conf transactions but.....not everyone has them yada yada.

Ppl don't get it. A HF is required amidst opposed sides and it is going to send the price way down despite prior HFs yada freaking bloody yada. This is why I exited prior to the exchanges seemingly reacting to the price drop. Listening to Vinny, other biggish players moved out too as the writing is clearly on the wall (and no it is not "death"). Bigger moves down will surely happen as the smarter ones step back and look at the reality.

Vinny described some of the issues. I am personally concerned with utter confusion and worry from non-nerds who will not have the confidence to negotiate wallets vs the chain they prefer. Thus value overall significant collapse as others capitalise as well (compounding the value issue). For many, this would surely be unwanted stress and "chaos" .

Bitcoin started off being obscure and still is depending on what it is compared to. No one in my wider family interfaces with bitcoin. I want bitcoin to succeed. I now support coins with what I regard as superior innovation. Sure, bitcoin is the current leader by hash rate but that is seemingly centralised which is fhcking crazy and a flaw). Bitcoin may currently have more network effect but I prefer to reward innovation where I see fit.

So you only approve of one side to things bitcoin. What a sad person you are. Do you scorn ppl for posting PBoC statements? Do you scorn people for reporting exchange failures? I have held more BTC for longer than most ppl. I don't care for "positive" political correctness to appease speculators and the like. I don't want to see ppl get burned. I warn newcomers that they can potentially make a big loss even when I have a lot of skin in the game. I will surely buy back into bitcoins when the opportunity presents. Just as i was reluctant to risk wobbly gox, I sold out early in this case because wealth preservation is something some ppl want to maintain.

Guessing: It is inevitable that 'double spend wallets for dummies' will/would become available for those wishing to commit fraud. IMHO, bitcoin needs a second layer with near instant payments that are confirmed in seconds at the most! All this talk about gold does nothing of for me. My wider family have their monies in cash...not gold. I have some gold but that is not my point. The average person does not. Their monies are within the currency they get paid in/save in/and spend on things they want and need. I am now invested in further crypto currencies and honestly thinking about finally completely exiting bitcoin today! I have already migrated some of dads bitcoin to a further crypto currency with permission, but need his further permission before I make further moves (no rush on this).
If bitcoin can get good quick scaled payment rails going, I will no doubt look to migrate wealth back. At the moment I find myself respecting upcoming coins that have payments in mind and tech for non-nerds/mum and dad etc to interface with.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:26:26

*Confusion &amp; worry from non nerds has been there since day one!* - No kidding. I have exited BTC like others are for reasons many will fail to grasp and that is fine. I now observe from the sidelines in a financial sense. I am not concerned that BTC is going to die. The main concern is over a massive value plummet prior and during a potential chain split. There are other factors for my departure too.

Yes. The dismissive attitude is just another factor that makes financial departure from BTC at the moment so much easier. Here are two prior recent comment of mine-----------I have exited. Reasons: 1) Innovation stagnation for BTC on the ground floor 2) Current lack of scaling ability and decision ability (I regard that time actually matters and the more time the more opportunity for other coins to establish) 3) Innovation and nimble decision making in other cryptocurrencies. 4) Other developers are very non-nerd tech focused. 5) Another coin has treasury to assist innovation and marketing of that coin plus other economic incentives for nodes instead of goodwill. 5) Chain split concerns and value chaos. Note: I knew of BTC in at least 2010 I want it to work, but i am now looking from the sidelines in terms of personal wealth.--------I'm over it and out now. I've been aware of BTC since at least 2010! I get Ver but disagree with BU. I would pref segwit and LN or other. I am now pretty much completely out except for scraps in wallets. I am drawn to innovation for payment systems, and BTC has seriously been left behind by up and coming coins many here will refuse to acknowledge. First mover "gold" does not cut it for me like it does others. I want BTC to thrive but it is getting left further and further behind. Should a contentious fork happen...I would suspect many nervous ppl withdraw their stake in BTC. The notion of splitting chains is too complicated for non-nerds to negotiate. I may return if things sort out.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:02:00
Yes, I did not need Vinny to say it. A world of pain is ahead. I want bitcoin to succeed just as much as anyone else, but I also want to prosper financially like most do. I exited like others did before the exchanges produced statements/letter etc. Players exited (talking with money in part) and everyone else took a look over their shoulder.

@_date: 2017-03-16 14:52:39
Good for you. Ver (and others) gives no sign of backing down and he has a lot of whale power as Vinny has pointed out (there is great irony in all of this). I am old school bitcoin, so I certainly get Ver to a degree, but I can see a second layer is required (LN if it works well?!). As each week and month slides by, the opportunity for superior tech coins becomes blatant to see for people like me (btc is going to feel it as market share continues to slide). I am a non-tech person and at this stage, I would rather ride the waves of a great altcoin than wonder at what volatility is going to happen in some fork and also what that fork says about bitcoin "gold". I would flee a fork situation anyway at this stage so why not just do it now! I desperately want bitcoin to work as a viable payment rail but have loaded the last 50btc I had onto the Poloniex exchange just now and am looking to exit BTC almost completely (truth). I have a lot of skin in the crypto game and set orders on exchanges that get the troll box rattled. See my YT channel with same name for bitcoin tutorials. I have helped the bitcoin ecosystem in my own way. Electrum even used my tutorial video linking from their homepage at one time. Enough is enough for now......I have hope for bitcoin, but I also see complacency and "first mover/gold" smugness that I cast personal doubt on at this time. Could say more but....best of luck :-)

Shrem endorsed Mt.Gox a month or two before it toppled (if I recall correctly). Geesh...anyone with an ounce of common sense could see that Mt.Gox was looking wobbly. I know a guy who risked Mt.Gox because he wanted the higher BTC value in USD..and lost out (but he knew he was risking it big time with the exchange). Yes, Shrem did not commit fraud, but he may have helped others to become victims of a potential fraud as Mt.Gox exploded. Could word this better.

Close enough. "stop playing an authority" - Play nice pretty please Roger! It seems to be the opinion that Ver certainly has some clout. There certainly appears to be a lot of tension, and I'm sure bitcoin could be operating in a superior manner to what it is right now (high fees /tension/possible contentious hard fork looming/chain split? etc).

Yes, (reality) I have traded out of BTC a lot lately (from main to small holding of cryptos). Reasons: BTC scaling issue not being sorted out. Worry over hard fork and a split on chains vs value plummet. I am personally impressed with dash development, nimble ability to develop, non-nerd friendly aims, funds for marketing and devs and dash's plans for the future (and I don't care that ppl here may dislike dash).

I'm over it and out now. I've been aware of BTC since at least 2010! I get Ver but disagree with BU. I would pref segwit and LN or other. I am now pretty much completely out except for scraps in wallets. I am drawn to innovation for payment systems, and BTC has seriously been left behind by up and coming coins many here will refuse to acknowledge. First mover "gold" does not cut it for me like it does others. I want BTC to thrive but it is getting left further and further behind. Should a contentious fork happen...I would suspect many nervous ppl withdraw their stake in BTC. The notion of splitting chains is too complicated for non-nerds to negotiate. I may return if things sort out.

@_date: 2016-06-16 03:56:52
Obviously, that makes you somewhat angry and vengeful. Hearn probably put a lot of work and devotion into trying to improve bitcoin with XT. Wasted work time can make one bitter. I have been there myself. He was surely working along similar lines to Satoshi and looking to expand the P2P digital cash network. Bitcoin has taken a different course to Satoshi's outlook. Blockstream is seemingly currently leading control it may seem to some. Hearn moved on. Good for him.

Oh good heavens, I typically don't agree with everything any other person states. Hearn is no exception. I don't agree with any plan to destroy Bitcoin's fungibility. I do apologise for not including that aspect.
Satoshi compared Bitcoin's P2P network with VISA's. I realise that there are potentially other ways to scale. An alternative to Bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned. I regard Bitcoin as an altcoin these days.

@_date: 2017-01-16 12:20:15
P2P digital cash. Get payed in bitcoin (yes...get serious). Satoshi talked about VISA. Using non-bank payment networks for coffee, pizza or space travel solves paying banks fees. In the case of Wikileaks, the bitcoin network enabled a means to donate and support them.
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:02:05

Personally, I don't think the price is going to be sub $500 for the next few years. But that is not the point. I've recently got dad to purchase 18 BTC (a little skin in the game). My original post is meant to provide a sobering warning to an investor. Yes, it is an unlikely scenario but I don't know when China is actually going to ban bitcoin or some shithead funds something sickening (massive ransom/terror attack/child abuse themes) with BTC that gives really bad press, and gets governments to take a second look.

Obviously, the price has risen. I've watched the value rise and fall since it was less than a US dollar in value. There was a time when ppl were fascinated that bitcoin could be exchanged for pizza (value). 
Prior to the latest halvening the value was sub $250. After the last halving in 2016 the value has been sub $600. These figures could have been higher or lower obviously. 
Are you suggesting bitcoin dies if the value goes sub $500 USD and stays there for some years to come?

I am just saying.
@_date: 2015-08-07 23:36:47
Hearn is right...I've thought it through and know many ppl in the community will obfuscate on this or have not thought it through. Cash sucks because it is physical and needs to be picked up which brings a risk of police. This aspect will be of particular concern to govts and massive extortions for the likes of kidnappings etc surely loom. Ppl like Largarde and govts have a view too.

I've come across the attitude that 'bitcoin should be for revolutionary transactions' (see quote below). I asked what a revolutionary transaction is?....no decent reply thus far.

He was doing this because he wanted the high cash-out rate but knew Gox was teetering.....because it was screamingly obvious despite Shrem &amp; Co. He lost his coin or so...but could not be angry....he took a simple educated risk (and happened to lose).

Exactly...I've heard it suggested...a year or two ago..and it may have been by Gavin....that we have a couple of years to build before making changes will become all too difficult. Serious stagnation may already be here. This opens the doors for another currency that can scale to become a large versatile peer to peer payment network.

The case progress ask media scenarios
Police are asking your help! Since May 2015, the police is investigating the incident at Jumbo supermarkets in Groningen and Zwolle where an explosive is used. The actions of the perpetrator have only resulted in material damage, there are no victims.
The identity of the perpetrator is not known to the police. The police and the prosecution do, together with Jumbo, anything to avoid another incident. We therefore appeal to you. Helps you figure out the identity of the perpetrator?
We invite you to join us think especially in the research. It may be that you have information about the Jumbo incident and / or the offender. Perhaps you recognize the combination of items that we call in this case? Or have you seen something for the investigation. Please let us know!
This file tells you what we have done so far as police. We also share specific information that has emerged during the investigation. Because of the investigative interest we publish all the details at this stage. Some information would only know the perpetrator. These so-called offender information serves as evidence in the investigation.
Your tips, questions and suggestions are viewed every day by a special team. After this, the reactions, where possible, added to this file.
For readability we speak in the file 'he' and 'perpetrator'. However, it is impossible to state with certainty that the perpetrator is a man, but we love strongly into account. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether there is one offender or more perpetrators.
Perpetrator seeks contact
TijdlijnIn the survey shows that the perpetrator seeks contact on several occasions with both Jumbo and police. To do this, the offender in various ways.
Offender place explosive to Wilhelminakade Groningen
On the night of 8 May 9 - the weekend of Mother's Day - a passerby sees a white bucket standing at the glass front of the Jumbo supermarket on the Wilhelminakade. The man finds it suspicious and called the police.
Location explosive WilhelminakadeIn the bucket sits include an explosive. This substance is in a safe place defused by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). The police are doing a neighborhood and passers-examination, but this does not lead to the identity of the perpetrator.
The study shows that such white buckets are used in the hospitality industry. The bucket is also a white kitchen timer. Both are important clues for the police.
Model Suzuki observed by a witness looking WilhelminakadeOok police the owners of a Suzuki Swift and two bikes parked near the supermarket. Are you on Friday evening / night 8 may have been on the Wilhelminakade and you still have not spoken with the police, we ask you to report urgently.
 
Offender place explosive to Victory Square Groningen
Approximately three weeks later, on Sunday May 31 a local resident heard a loud bang at the Jumbo supermarket on Victory Square in Groningen. It is not immediately clear what happened.
Location explosive OverwinningspleinEen few days later, from camera images that something has been detonated. As a result, damage to a window and door frame arise. During the investigation the police will include some fragments of a timer to gray. A neighborhood and passers research or provide information, but do not lead to the identity of the perpetrator.
 
Offender OverwinningspleinWel are camera images of the perpetrator. It shows that the perpetrator after placing the explosive its journey across Canada Avenue, towards the junction with the Occupation Hitting. The camera images are shown on YouTube and the TV program Investigation Requested. There are many reactions, but the gold tip is unfortunately not.
Perpetrator sends letter to Jumbo
On June 5, a letter received by Jumbo. In the letter the offender requests a quantity of bitcoins, an electronic payment. **He writes that he no sooner stop his activities until he receives the requested bitcoins.** The card is mailed in northern or eastern Netherlands. The envelope is stamped in the sorting center in Zwolle. The letter was made possible with the software program Notepad.
Perpetrator sends bomb Jumbo Euroborg Groningen
Jumbo Euroborg - PD research
Saturday, June 6 - the day of the final of the Champions League - following a third incident. To 12:17 pm comes to the police a message that there is an explosive at the Jumbo Euroborg the Boumaboulevard in Groningen. The mayor and the police decide to evacuate the store and the environment.

Coinbase to purchase.....when you have a reasonable amount of Bitcoin....get yourself a hardware wallet like Trezor.

Bitcoins can be mixed and anon sidechains are surely going to make things easier.
Ransomed bitcoins could be moved daily from wallet to wallet which would and then simply sold off one day to someone in another country on the other side of the world for another currency. They could be put into shapeshift and exchange for DASH and then converted back to Bitcoins if preferred.

Bitcoin is highly regulated. It is more regulated than any issuance from a central bank IMHO. Governments can issue legal status all day long. Governments don't regulate Bitcoin. They seek to regulate the actions of ppl who use Bitcoin. Government policy may flip flop depending on who is in power and how the legalese is interpreted etc. Things generally get very murky when central banks, government and court systems get involved in things they shouldn't.

Cryptocurrencies make for the potential to bypass central bank issuance and thus the support of it completely.

Goodness, I don't make payments to bankers either. The very notion is disturbing! Read again: "If you like the notion of making payments without bankers getting a cut"
I do make payments and transactions where bankers take a transaction fee ("a cut"). Bitcoin provides a means to minimise or even completely avoid making payments via banking payment systems. Thus, the bankers don't collect fees on the transactions.

I basically agree. Many spot on points. Most ppl could not give a flying fhck about decentralised and bitcoin is still clunky. For tech by tech ppl still. Many businesses need near instant transactions if possible (this needs to come). The block size debate shows that bitcoin is nearing becoming something that can't be changed or improved. Block times to one minute even, would mean a lot to non-tech ppl....but not to tech ppl.

I actually made the transaction to one of them with instruction in front of the other 2 two share the BTC 3 ways. He downloaded the blockchain.info BTC phone wallet and I was impressed that he researched BTC a little. I did it out of presence of one of the hotels senior bosses in the bar room and gave it to a smartly suited employee who worked the hotel reception. Only he was allowed his phone whilst on the job whilst the other 2 were not. They all clearly got along and my original tip offer was actually not him, but the bar staff. The Hotel is Green Olive in Aurangabad, India. It is a slightly up market hotel. Nice place. Yes, Aurangabad is not a wealthy western city. Mostly grotty. Luckily it has two Unesco world heritage site near by that attract visitors like myself.

Borders have been around long before capitalism. Tribal territories were the norm along with tribal genocides on one another. I grew up in New Zealand. So lets use that as an example.

I've spent a few months in China and lived part of that with Chinese friends in their home. China is pretty insular. It is a taste of what it could be like with no choice of govt, thus nationalism on a planetary scale. I prefer diversity of government on this planet ( and it is not perfect ).

Perhaps the decisions should go the lowest on the SJW "victim list".


When I was a teenager, I picked boysenberries during the season to help pay for my 80cc motorbike expenses. There were about 30 other pickers and I was usually the fastest picker of boysenberries on each day. Because of this I got the most pay (and fair share of skin scratches). Why should others get the same amount of pay as me?
Humans are easily corrupted. It is part of who we are as a species. For years in my 30s I drove around in an year 2000 model 1000cc car to help save money. A lot of people would not do this. We are all different, just as each section of land is different on this planet. Many would prefer to live right on the beach front at a premier location with great views rather than where they are now.

(Without much or any exception, countries have a mix of qualities such as capitalistic or socialistic within their policy fabric).

What is proper social service you? Who decides what these things mean? What about mining and drilling for oil and resources? Who gets to make the numerous decisions and considerations required about this? Geesh...right now I'm watching testimonials on vaccine injury for example. I've watched many hundreds of them. I actually administer them, but realise they have very serious potential dangers. Many people on this planet want to take away peoples right to refuse these highly complicated solutions. Take China for example where they make it mandatory! (Ahh China again!). Life is so complicated..there are so many aspects. When you take away diversity of govt.....it leaves me almost speechless as it is so insane!

Many capitalist countries have welfare systems (which is a socialistic means of support for those in need). This does not make the country  a socialist country. The greater population is NOT socialist. The non-govt workforce works is separated with diverse businesses that work in a capitalistic manner free from govt lead socialistic control and forced schemes of social equity.

The now elderly Chinese man of the house described how some years ago in one part of China, some from the muslim population were killing Chinese police.

(Countries have a mix of capitalist and socialistic aspects but America for example has a more capitalistic legacy rather than a communist legacy).

Some ppl get paid in bitcoin. Like you and I, they spend money. But they don't want to have to hold central bank issuance. 
I detest having to cash out to buy stuff.
Bitcoin is too volatile for many companies to hold. Companies can transact with customers in a non-bank controlled network (that is awesome). Saving is a good thing. VISA, MasterCard and the likes miss out on their transaction fees. 
With less volatility, more companies may be prepared to risk holding bitcoin in years to come.

Why would companies hold a fluctuating currency like Bitcoin. Their profit margins could be wiped. Yes, other currencies fluctuate.
Investors purchase Bitcoin from BitPay. They don't get sold on exchanges. Spending bitcoin or holding central bank to spend? Some people have a bitcoin salary. People buy things either way. That is life, people spend. It is a matter of supporting a network. I've had to "cash out" of bitcoin to have central bank issuance to spend.

Exactly - whilst bitcoin is in it's younger years it needs to be developed when changing it is easier amidst miners yada yada. I think this is the basic sentiment from Gavin.

Asian cultures are excelling at within academia for example and making the highest average wages for their cultural sector. In America Asians have even been discriminated against in some cases, to make positions for others! I have been to the high school in China of my Chinese friend and learned about the insane amount of hours the Chinese spend with their studies. That is part of their culture. Not all Chinese will study hard, obviously. When talking about culture, there are many generalisations due to the vastness of individuality within.

“Digital currencies do not currently pose a material risk to monetary or financial stability in the United Kingdom, given the small size of such schemes. For instance, it is estimated that there is less than £60 million worth of bitcoins circulating within the UK economy, which represents less than 0.1% of sterling notes and coin and only 0.003% of broad money balances.” - In a pre-release article issued in the Q3 2014, the Bank of England stated that

Women currently excel men within western education. Blacks are not slaves in western countries, but the practice still happens in Africa and about the Middle East. Whites joined blacks in the slave trade then later sought to abolish the practice, but it still exists unfortunately.
Yes, various cultures may still ban women from education. In India they still do similar practices for example. It probably happens within some middle Eastern societies to this day. In Africa and the middle east slavery still exists to this day. Serfdom in England was a form of slavery. The word slavery apparently derives from Slavic slavery conducted by Arabs (Slavic / Slav-e). Whites, blacks, Indians and Arabs have had black slaves over history. Whites have been slaves with the Barbary slave trade being an example.
Despite slavery of blacks which will have mainly been concentrated in Africa and the middle East…this does not pertain to the blacks who have not been slaves across Africa or Australia or other cultures across South America. When we compare these cultures to the technological progress born from white societies within European countries not involved in slave trades……..I am not just looking at America's history. I am looking at the history of societies across the planet.
Women are outperforming men in regards to numbers graduating from university here in Australia. I think you will find the same in America. This chart within this webpage shows a cross-over point in the 1980s for example:

You are a racist if you deny genetic differences between human races.
It is totally racist to suggest white people or asians are as good as black at setting 100m sprint world records. Black people are clearly more likely to produce genetically superior athletes for many events. Deny it all you want. You racists can try. Genetics can define racial qualities. Genetics are not racist.
*In general……*
- People with African genetics are more likely to be superior running events over all other races. It is of zero surprise that the American Basketball Association (NBA) has over 70% black players in the premier league. The black genes make for superior players.
- Due to genetics, the Vietnamese people were able to use very small tunnel systems to evade American soldiers. The famous CuCu tunnels in South Vietnam come to mind.
- Due to genetics, the African Tutsi tribe boasts the tallest overall tribe in Africa.
- Due to genetic, African pygmy tribes boast very short people when compared to others. This small stature may benefit the tribe in some situations within rain forests.
- Due to genetics, various breeds of animals are utilised for various tasks or consumption. Various breeds of dog have more cognitive ability to understand human commands. Border Collies may excel other breeds in terms of understanding new commands.
- Different races may encounter variant mean rates of side effects to various pharmaceuticals for example. America's FDA does not dance around "political correctness" when providing the facts:

Skin colour is obviously not a culture but most cultural groups historically share a dominating skin colour in common. Yes, yes, yes, there are variants obviously within tribes and cultures. 
Place of birth vs culture: A geographic location is not a culture. But a human culture may dominate that geographic location. Culture is a way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time. Human cultures tend to be located to various geographic regions, naturally people travel and many take their cultural traits with them. I'm certainly going to struggle adhering to the culture of the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, without locating myself with them.
Mbuti pigmies of the Congo would share a median lower height than the Tutsi tribe in Rwanda. This is an example of a variant between cultural groups beyond skin colour medians. Pigmies are very unlikely to dominate international basketball competitions against other black racial groups or selected athletic events at an Olympic games. 
If I was black man talking about how proud I am of my races history and endeavours I would not get much grief. I think black people should be proud of their history and accomplishments even if it may entail enslaving other black people in Africa. Not all blacks would have a history a family line that has owned black slaves after all. At least we can examine our lives today and decide what is right and wrong.

Bitcoin is a decentralised platform. Having your own wallet rather than an account with a company means that if the company closes down, you still have access to your funds. The Mt. Gox bitcoin drama was due in part to ppl trusting a stranger in Japan with their bitcoins.
For many of us, the true spirit of Bitcoin is to have complete control your own bitcoin. I have not used Blockchain in ages but I like the Electrum wallet due to it's simplicity. In all fairness, Coinbase now offers access to private keys so if they get shut down/go bankrupt or something goes wrong, you still have ultimate access to your funds, but I don't know how it works (you need to research).

You are probably the racist. I oppose any anti-white or anti-male sentiment because it is racist, just as I oppose racist sentiment to other races (Black, Asian or whatever…).
Asians (mainly Chinese) are doing better in western countries in terms of university graduation and mean income levels. Why?….well I live with a Chinese family now, and I have been to Chinese schools in China and met various teachers and pupils. The Chinese have a culture of hard work interns of study times that most other cultures don't come close to. Their genetics may also pre-dispose them to having a better capacity of academic learning than white people. This is a generalisation.
Woman have excelled in western countries in regards to university graduation numbers over men for decades. I have worked in many industries and I have never even heard of a woman getting paid less for doing the same work as a man or vice versa.

The Mycelium phone app is one way. Locate 'cold storage' and scan the paper wallet QR code. To locate 'cold storage' on my Samsug Note3 I bring up the menu when touching the right hand 'button' at the bottom of the phone. You can transfer a portion of the bitcoin via the app. During the process you can scan the receiving address or get it via the 'clipboard'.
GreenBits phone wallet has 'sweep' too.

It is an historic culture of invention that continues on into the 21st century. It is still not matched to any significant degree by any other culture or societal group. Other cultures appropriate the technology and white men generally don't have an issue with that.

There are numerous reports that asian students are being penalised by default by various academic institutions across America such as Harvard where black segregation is being introduced for ceremonies.
In the case of Harvard, it is reported that racial discrimination is used to favour Hispanics and Blacks. Asian-American groups have rightly voiced their concern over the racist oppression.
Asian-Americans make up about 12% of the Californian population but around 40% of University numbers at Universities like UC Berkeley. Stunning numbers. A reflection of asian culture.

To their credit, they are looked into the issue and mentioned the Wifi chaos in that shopping area. I'm not sure what the issue was exactly. They tell me it is not usually an issue. Actually, maybe the other places use BitPos as well come to think of it (Pub and another cafe). Anyway…..

Bitcoin is a digital peer to peer payment system (this is a big deal). Bitcoin is also a means of storing wealth if one chooses to do so. Gold has different properties and is a means to store wealth. I've come across goldbugs who dislike Bitcoin so much they would prefer people support PayPal or VISA! They want ppl supporting traditional banks and using the USD instead of an alternative non-bank system like Bitcoin (no bank to get involved and no bank fees). 
Anyway, I like Peter but know that his understanding of Bitcoin is still poor.

Morality aside. I'm quite sure some woman have been raped due to the clothes they have worn. I would not assume this has not happened to men also.
Morality aside. I'm sure guys have also been beaten due to the clothes they have worn. A friend of mine wore a shirt that was white but got stained pink in the wash (due to red clothing in the wash). Some Lebanese guys threatened to beat him up as they drove by. They saw the pink shirt.
Morality aside. I have been threatened somewhat before due to the clothing (suede type purple long pants) I have worn in a situation where I was outnumbered and being teased and tested buy multiple guys of a Lebanese heritage that I don't share with them. I had heard that they have severely beaten people over racial themes prior to my encounter. They stole my bike. Long story. I got my bike back though! I showed them respect.
Morality aside. My mother was in Brazil last year and got warned by a local woman not to take photos with the iPad on the beach. She was told she was putting herself at risk of being followed and mugged for the iPad. My mother took the advice of the local girl and concealed the iPad and took extra caution.
Morality aside. Children have also no doubt beaten other children due to the clothing worn.

Having pride in ones country and culture is not extreme and is not intolerant. The Japanese are perhaps the most protective of their nation and race. I gather you view the Japanese as intolerant and extreme just because they don't adhere to your principles, but why should they? If Japan was a white dominated nation there would be the cry of "racist" but we can't call any race racist except for white, which is as racist as it gets. I had an elderly Chinese woman in the last week or two ask after my Scottish surname. She remarked that her sister married a Scotsman and her family disowned her due to their disapproval of a mixed race marriage. 
Intolerance is found when foreigners come to a different country and don't abide by that nations culture and laws.
Over one hundred thousand woman in England have suffered female genital mutilation. The vast majority of these are performed by people who are intolerant of English law and culture.
Slavery is still performed in parts of the middle east and Africa and Asia to this day. The numbers of slaves today are possibly higher than ever before! In America a minority of blacks owned slaves and well as a minority whites and even Indians are said to have owned blacks slaves. A minority in each case. The move to abolish slavery came from England. The slavery derives in part from the white Slavic slaves of the middle east.

This reddit has thousands of ppl joining and no doubt, many new readers. I have not posted the list in ages, but some forum readers will remember it. Many ppl just want the boring facts. has a Lamassu vender I think (could be wrong). Robogate does not like Lamassu or Robocoin it seems. I am aware of issues with both these companies/product. I'm not sure about robogate's attitude to further bitcoin "ATM" companies.
A while back (a year approx?), a few members here got their nickers in a twist when I repeatedly pointed out that "ATM" operators are the ones deciding whether or not to enable KYC/AML measures on "ATMs". The company Robocoin changed their policy on this though for US machines last year and I don't blame operators whom purchased the machine prior to the policy change for being angry. Hopefully they can implement independent software (if reqd) and do their thing. Robocoin machines operate without the need to take down ppls ID.
The Robocoin machines utilised a palm vein scan as part of the ID process. Many ppl seemed to be frightened by this form of "invasive" biometric ID taking that is unfamiliar to them. Some ppl did not appreciate it when I explained that photo IDs are by far the most trackable and thus invasive human biometric on the planet. Mt Gox (did), Coinjar and Coinbase take photo ID among others in the Bitcoin space. Govts use photo ID and ppl are tracked. Even Samsung TVs can assist to track ppl via this means. Law enforcement commonly utilises finger prints. Finger prints are useful because we potentially leave them behind.
Vein patterns are not readily observed by plain sight, nor left behind "at the scene".
Due to the nature of what I was pointing out, some ppl got emotional and accused me of being a Robocoin sales person or whatever. I don't work with anything Bitcoin related or the computer/tech industry. Facts can really infuriate ppl. Some ppl want finger waggling "circle jerks" despite the reality of imperfections and sobering truths.
Some ppl just want the facts :-)

Things can be more complicated than what ppl might imagine. Let the market decide new businesses improve on features, and why not waggle the finger at ones self.
Even though it apparently does not apply to banks, ppl within the Bitcoin "world" should watch their step (Shrem is a good example) and make sure they don't get jail sentences (mind the spot light on cryptos!).

I gather you deny that black genetics have made for superior record breaking sports figures over the years at Olympic running events (or won't admit it). Is it the blacks have trained harder than other racial groups?? Lol.
I live with a Chinese family and have been to schools in China and met and worked with teachers there. I see first hand how the Chinese culture puts in the hard work in regards to huge study demands. Just look at UC Berkeley which can boast a student population of over 70% with asian genetics and cultural values no doubt, whilst asians make up less than 15% of California's population. Whilst I DON'T categorically state that Chinese genetics (Han People mainly) assist academic learning capability, I certainly do when it comes to general cultural values that can be found within Chinese communities.

The 'white men' in the thread photo were judged whether they like it or not. There is plenty of arguably derogatory styled comments taking a stab at them in this thread for being male or white or both. So a beating down for being a white male is fine whilst suggesting one should be proud to be a white male is not fine!
I am judged by skin colour and sex. It is a facet of who I am. My skin colour determines a significant part of my identity amidst other humans on this planet. Many people may be proud of their hair, nails, skin tone, skin colour, height, mental faculties, dress, posture, beauty, muscles, elegant body type, health, and eye colour. Again, most people realise they are judged by their appearance and this can often include the history that goes with it.

Personally, I don't want mind if people want to walk naked or wear clothes that arouse the imaginations of others in a sexual manner. As a human being, I am well aware that my senses can be aroused along the lines of sexual attraction to others due to a change in what they are wearing. As it happens, I am personally opposed to anyone getting raped and don't believe they deserve to be raped under any circumstances. If you value my personal view so little, that is fine. 
People get mugged for their jewellery and even shoes! I am not opposed to someone going about their daily affairs with one million USD attached to their body on plain sight of others.
In China, I filmed Chinese migrant men looking for work with signs on the street (workers market). I was quickly swarmed by 20-30 hostile Chinese men. I was lucky, my Chinese friend was there to calm the hostile situation where I was clearly in deep shit. I chose not to repeat the same action for the rest of the trip.
I've chosen to do a u-turn on a dark back street in the city I reside in right now, due to the potential risk of being beaten and robbed by four huge guys whom were walking side by side taking up the whole street. They taunted me as I turned before them.
My mother decided to conceal her iPad due to a perceived increased risk of being mugged (on a beach in Brazil). Personally, I would prefer that the reality of the situation was different. I would prefer that my mother could use her iPad without the increased risk of being mugged. A local woman took the time to approach her on the beach and warn her of the potential danger. I would assume you oppose my mother's decision to conceal her iPad?

Bitcoin is decentralised and is peer to peer. It is about replication and a million plus cryptocurrencies. Adam Back talked about this. I suspect this aspect may be the downfall of cryptos in the decades to come. Once bitcoins market cap is breached and wave after happens. Scarcity gone.

"It's irrelevant, at best (since you aren't introducing any new information), and sounds like victim blaming/perpetrator apologetics at worst." - I am certainly aware of actions I could have taken in life that may have lead to serious negative consequences on my behalf at the hands of others (as described earlier). It is just reality. Whether you or I like it or not.
I make no apologies for perpetrators and am not particularly opposed to having them killed. Indeed, I may kill a perpetrator myself if I feel the need in the future and the situation arises.
I don't blame victims but know from my own experience that my actions can potentially increase my risk of becoming a victim.
"It's irrelevant, at best (since you aren't introducing any new information), and sounds like victim blaming/perpetrator apologetics at worst."
I don't mind what others do and don't like people being mugged or raped etc.

"The letter also went as far as to threaten the business owners with additional fines and possible prison time:" - This is one reason why operators may choose to enable KYC/AML features on various "ATMs". I've used machine with and without KYC measures. Personally, I would prefer these features were not required. I don't stand in the shoes of a Bitcoin "ATM" operator though.
Here is a bit of a breakdown of many current Bitcoin "ATMs"
1W=one way (buy bitcoin only) 2W= two ways (bitcoin to cash and back) KYC= Know Your Customer, AML= Anti-money Laundering.
* atm4coin         1W &amp; 2W Open source project..ongoing. Machine availability?
* Bitcoin Vending Machine 1W (Brazilian) 
* Bit-Wallet         1W &amp; 2W No KYC functions.
* BTC-O-Matic     1W No KYC functions.
* Btcu                1W (possibly 2W) fake mobile no can be used, no effective KYC.
* Cash2BTC         1W No KYC functions. (build yourself)
* Flycoin             1W (possibly 2W) (requires 3rd party software for Bitcoin)
* General Bytes   1W Optional fingerprint reader and AML options for operators. POS functionality including staff tips feature.
* Hot Butler        1W Cash or CCs, no KYC features.
* Lamassu          1W &amp; 2W Offers document ID scan features. The operator decides.
* Moneero          1W (possibly 2W) "Conforms to international AML/KYC standards"
* Open BTC ATM  1W DIY (build yourself) 'Open Bitcoin ATM'
* Pay Maq           1W
* Skyhook           1W No KYC functions.
* Tembusu          1W Optional ID scanner/thumbprint scan/AML features for operators.
* Bit2Bit             2W Optional KYC/AML features including fingerprint scan for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* BitAccess BTM   2W Document scan, mobile phone no. Optional?
* Bitxatm            2W + POS, supports any cryptocurrency, KYC/AML options, fingerprint scan option.
* BTCpoint          2W KYC options (fingerprint scan etc) for operators. Lite/Doge too.
* Coinoutlet         2W KYC/AML options (operators decide) ID scan if required. Accepts altcoins if configured. Online shopping module.
* Coinplug           2W AML feature (not known if optional) KYC? (Korean) 
* Diamond Circle  2W Visa/MC not cash. KYC (via bank CCs) and AML variances for operators.
* Dogevertise ATM 2W Bitcoin, Lite &amp; Doge too. No KYC functions.
* Genesis1          2W Optional fingerprint reader/gov ID &amp; bank card reader for operators. Lite/Doge too
* Localbitcoins ATM 2W Nil KYC features.
* Robocoin          2W Optional ID scan/palm vein scan/camera &amp; optional AML feature for operators (Compulsory KYC for the USA)

I'm simply explaining to you, as a function of communication, why this particular type of declaration is typically seen as victim blaming. - I don't care. I state my experience of reality and what I find most truthful. I realise ppl get emotional and it is not pleasant or popular. My initial comment started out as "Morality aside". Perhaps I should have stated "Emotion and morality aside".
I have things concealed in my car right now in order to not temp thieves to break in. Police have entered the very room I am typing in right now due to a household intrusion and thefts. I live in a neighbourhood where there is a reasonable prevalence of people addicted to "drugs" the government has deemed illegal. Knowing this, I take extra precautions. In the case of the intrusion, my preparedness minimised the amount of loss due to theft. Such is life.

Human scientific consensus is extremely limited due to the tools and processes available. We don't even know how Panadol/Tylenol works.
Medicine alone has little concept as to the origin of many chronic disease states. We have no idea how the chemical compounds of our brain retain memories or smells/witnessed scenes/tastes/textures etc/bodily sensations etc yet they exist. Where do the intricacies of nightmares and dream states come from?

All good. I happen to live in Australia not that it means a lot. Adam Tepper RIP (Australian) was part of the bitcoin ecosystem. 
I remember the days when it was it was just bitcoin. I had none, but have some of an idea of how much shit was thrown at ppl who were building up Bitcoin from 2010 onwards. It took me years to enter, risk was high and I'm no techie. 
I resent Palmer (Australian) taking multiple swings at ppl involved in Bitcoin. "People were being friendly to one another. I think people took some solace in that," Palmer said of doge as opposed to bitcoin. The road has never been that smooth for bitcoin and the risks were mega high earlier on. You will find rude ppl everywhere (Shibecoin exposed that). I think Palmer was well out of line.

I looked into Etherium and spent a few hours about a year or so ago trying to understand what it may bring to the table. Etherium offers ethers which can basically be traded as currency. I am not opposed to Etherium but I am well aware of how Bitcoin may fall and the potential wave or domino effect. On this level, I am am quite uncertain about where the future lies. EVERY altcoin brings something new and EVERY alt coin is either Bitcoin 2.0 or a compliment to bitcoin with added features (OK not every one…there will be thousands prob by the end off this year or now..blah). The founder of doge notably took a stab at ppl who are involved in bitcoin, casting everyone as arseholes basically…nice! Whatever works I guess.

If Bitcoin falls to another crypto I concur with Adam Backs sentiments. It will then be a cascade as ppl swap to the next thing and the next thing and then give up. We will end up with 100,000s or whatever amount of cryptos with no substantial volume or value. Even though I like the notion of Etherium and other cryptos I'm fully aware that this paradigms can change. If I was out to destroy Bitcoin and was super rich…I would make a competitor with awesome marketing and give it a higher market cap. There are plenty of billionaires on the planet.

Gold comes in variant forms that affect price  - coins/bars/condition/stolen?/counterfeit/purity-copper/manufacturer reputation/collectible coins-bars/numismatic coins…….
What? - are people expected to melt down their gold and potentially lose considerable amounts of "money". I don't understand.
Counterfeit items can even fool gold traders!!! How do members of the public have a chance of protecting themselves against counterfeit items? I don't understand.
How is a business going to know how much each gold item is worth? Many businesses don't have time to much around inspecting and assessing gold item values? Imagine being in a supermarket check-out line!!!! Verging on impossible.

"You are trying to compare the raw element with a product." - Who has the raw element? I don't and neither does my imaginary friend. Are we talking nuggets? Who is going to melt coins with premiums to have "raw element" with fungibility.
Welcome to the real world, rather than the fantasy of ppl having the same gold products in the same condition. The fantasy is not a reality in my case. 
I am a buyer of consumer grade products. Various bars and coins fetch various prices. The thought of buying something with any of my gold raises questions in my head (price for my coins/coin premiums/how to price coins/denomination for bread, milk and shoes??/counterfeit coins bars/assay/carat/hall marks) I don't know of any retailers in my country that accept gold directly for their goods or services despite gold being used for trade for 1000s of years. How can retailers determine the price of gold product they are receiving? Gold is obviously not great for trade as retailers generally don't use it. 
Yes, gold can be traded for central bank issued fiat which is generally accepted for goods due and is traded quickly face to face due to it's fungibility. If I was to go to a bullion/coin store and get govt issued fiat so I can actually buy everyday items, the process of getting the cash at the coin store would take time as they assess a price for the particular gold product.
