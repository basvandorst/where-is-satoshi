I don't know... /s I think I'm going to send it anyway to be safe /s how do we know that it isn't the bfx hackers reddit account that was the one that was hacked? I wonder what game theoretic scenario might play out then?

Holy shit. This blew my mind. I had no idea, and had never seen it put this way. I've read the lightning paper, and up until this moment in time I've been a strong proponent of lightning networks as a scaling solution. Question for you, where do CLTV micro payment channels fit into all of this? I view them as a second layer solution that enhances scaling while remaining peer to peer.  Thank you for this video. You have converted me. I can't believe that BCash really was the real Bitcoin this entire time, I feel bamboozled.

Does anyone have an estimate of the number of transactions that the legacy system is currently executing per second?
EDIT: and... the wiki has this covered...

I like this chain of thought,  Satoshi as an evil genius hell bent on destroying the world.

This is literally a back of the envelope calculation, but TIL  that 1 bitcoin transaction requires an amount of energy equivalent to 5lbs of TNT detonating.  
72 million Watts for the network,
7 transactions per second,
4.1 trillion joules per kiloton TNT,

How cool would it be to have segwit activate right at the moment of the new moon while it is in total solar eclipse. Moon anyone?

I think it's Hal Finney and whenever he is finally thawed out a thousand years from now he will be the most powerful person in the galaxy. Go Hal!

The six small pads to the left of the stm are a tag-connect interface,  thats what you use to talk to that chip over a serial wire debug interface. Would be great to hook up a bus pirate and use openOCD to see if the chip is locked or not.

i shapeshifted to ltc hoping to play the spread when segwit locked, seems to have worked out.

Also, it would also occur over a much longer timescale (a decade or so?), but the thing is, I dont think you can predict what the scale up for the next cycle will be, but 10X looks reasonable?

I'm mildly offended at your blasphemy against our beloved Moon, may the Moon always reign before us and be the one true direction. Gentlement this is Moon!

Check back in a few halvenings down the road, we haven't seen anything yet. Wait until the new supply is down below a coin per block.
