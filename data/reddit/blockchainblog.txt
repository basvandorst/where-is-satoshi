We are very close though. When doing research on new waves of wallets, I found a few wallets that address a lot of concerns with more popular wallets. Adoption from people that just 'want it to work' are compromising security for ease of use. Most wallets, require many steps and intimidate non-technical users. These multiple steps are in place to protect the users private key or MPK if they are using an HD wallet.
A solution to less technical users that 'want it to work' are hardware wallets like [Case]( The only technical understanding that a user would need is how to participate in a Bitcoin transaction. Case is the only wallet that uses GSM / SIM that I've found. Most wallets require additional devices or have LBE / Wifi limitations. Wallets are most people's first exposure with bitcoins so they should be easy to use but don't require many steps to complicate the process. There are quite a variety of companies offering wallets this year. I personally will try to refresh my knowledge of wallet offerings often because the space is changing too quickly to assume there is no more innovation. 
(Shameless plug) I posted a list of features and companies for the different deterministic wallets I looked at [Here](

That's why I started thinking away from financial Bitcoin use, to blockchain use and started researching various areas. I wrote down how an Blockchain tech can be used to recreate Cap and Trade recently. It could eventually be possible to cut emissions, raise carbon credit prices, involve developing nations in environmental action, and incentivize smart contracts. 
I would hyperlink but unsure how to on Alien Blue.
