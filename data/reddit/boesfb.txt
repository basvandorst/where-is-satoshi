I thought we agreed that Bitcoin was the *internet of money*, and not the other way around?

It's an extra "layer" of functionality that will be added to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was a hotdog, then Lightning is like ketchup and mustard, on the hotdog.

Nevermind, the second transaction eventually appeared and now everything is going as planned. Thanks for the help anyways!

This is one of the most amazing things I have seen this year. Being able to press a button, initiate a payment and immediately receive my product in under a second still feels like a fantasy, but it's *here*. Holy shit!

If we say the price of Bitcoin reaches $500,000 in the future, that's $15,000. Not exactly *rich*, but still an amazing return for something that's worth $124 right now.

Not mining. You're gonna need a large-scale farming operation with thousands of GPUs for Bitcoin mining to be profitable now.

Yep. The BCH blockchain was a carbon copy of the BTC blockchain, meaning that if you had BTC when the fork happened, then you also own BCH, and they're contained in the same private keys (but on the BCH blockchain).

It takes *five more minutes* (if even that) and it'll pay off immensely in the future. Stop being lazy.

I'm not sure how hardware wallets work since I don't have one, but I would assume that the hardware wallet has its own addresses and that you can just send Bitcoins to it, no need for any kind of connection.

Storing your coins on Coinbase (or any other exchange) is basically as safe as storing them as your balance on an online casino. You never know what might happen when you're not the one in control. The website could go offline at any moment, for example.
Transfer them to a wallet where you (and only you) have access to the private keys. This could mean a wallet app on your phone (Mycelium, Samourai Wallet, Breadwallet), a wallet program on your computer (Electrum, MultiBit HD, Bitcoin Core Wallet), [a paper wallet]( or a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano S). There are many options, and I urge you to take the time to read and educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:37:13
Breadwallet is only for iOS, and Mycelium is ~~only~~ for Android. They both do the same thing, just on different platforms.
*Edit*: Mycelium is now for iPhone as well

@_date: 2017-09-30 12:44:41
Did you download the Bitcoin Core wallet? Because that one downloads the entire blockchain (which is a *huge* download, emphasis on huge), and is not necessary if you're gonna use Bitcoin casually. Look into a wallet like Electrum, or Mycelium/Breadwallet for Android/iOS.
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:48:20
Nevermind then. [The Bitcoin Core wallet]( is for PC only, and was the first ever wallet program, and thus needed you to download the entire blockchain before it could be used. This is not the case anymore, with other programs. Breadwallet should be fine.

If you "don't have time", then why do you keep replying?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:11:06
But why would I spend my money if I know that it'll be worth more tomorrow? Won't that halt the flow of the economy?
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:30:30
Mycelium for Android, Breadwallet for iOS

Because they are just apps that manage your Bitcoin wallets and keys, and don't use any kind of server that could get hacked.
