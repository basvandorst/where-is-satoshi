Even though I agree 100% with the validity and long term viability of btc, the blockchain, cryptos etc, to be "safe" - at least for the short/med term I still think it's best to have a diversified portfolio of investments, which \*absolutely\* should include bitcoin, but also include precious metals, and even some \*gasp!\* (admittedly corrupt / rigged) stocks and bonds. Plus it's fun to dabble into some lesser-known investments, like peer to peer microloans. I talk about this in more detail in this video in case you're interested :) [

As exciting as that is - not to mention the LTC halving next year - we still got a long way to go, so mentally I'm trying not to get myself too worked up for that yet. Cool image though and on the other hand it is indeed fun to think about what that will do to the price :)

agreed, I don't think the stock bull market is over either... it definitely can't keep hitting new highs forever, and what goes up must come down etc etc, but for now (short term) stocks, ie S&amp;P 500 definitely seem to be the "wave to ride". As with anything, it goes without saying just as a percentage of your investment portfolio.

Just curious what you mean by "buy broad market with low TER (CSPX, VOO, SPY)." - can you explain a bit more?
