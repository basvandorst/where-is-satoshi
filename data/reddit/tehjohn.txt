2020 will probably show all of us what "financial stability" is when the incoming crash will teach the fiat hodlers a lesson. Banks charge negative interest in Europe now... Not saying BTC is the savior, just saying that people have to look around if the crisis is there. 
Sure real estate will not depreciate in value and gold might rise, but do you want to fedex a goldcoin to someone to pay a bill? I am sure nobody thinks that we may have a crash like that and I do not know either - but the financial system we have currently is deemed to crash like it does every 50-60years - masked by wars or changed in the currency structure. (inception of Euro for instance)
BTC will not rise "organically" to the price mentioned on the internet - it will do so once people will "flee" into the only asset that offers a liquidity and stability (in terms of loss / seizing / changing) in that situation. 
CME are basically betting on Bitcoin like you would on a horse at the derby - you bet on it, but you do not need to touch the horse to be a winner or a loser. If you now bribe the Vet to cripple that horse in certain situations to have a better quota on other horses .. -&gt; welcome to Bitcoin.
Just my 2 sat.

Look at Europe - Italy for instance - any payment more than 1000Euro has to be paid with bank account or credit card.
Cyprus account holders with more than 100k Euro in the bank were stripped of 30% of their funds to pay for the banks debts.
The war is already there ...

Cool story but naming the country would be nice to get an insight why the struggle was so huge.
  
When i travel in Asia you can buy and sell your Bitcoin in an app and collect the money 1h later at an ATM (cardless with a special code).
Or collect it at a nearby bank.
Asian Countries travelled without BTC issues:
(plus some shops accepting BTC directly)
Philippines / Manila / Cebu / Tagbilaran/ Bohol(available over coins app)
Thailand / Bangkok / Pattaya(available over coins app) 
Singapore (even some Escorts take BTC there - a friend from a friend's friend said so :D)
S. Korea / Seoul (all over the place and ATMs here)
Japan / Toyko (ATMs / Exchanges)
Vietnam / Ho chi minh (ATMs / Exchanges)
This is just Asia - i travel a lot and never had issues.
So where did you go? 
Easter Islands? Exchanging BTC near the heads?
Sorry if i sound rude, but i would have understood your post if it was 2013 and the only place to buy stuff was Silkroad.
Today there are virtually no limits ...

Well, the ATM is what i think is the easiest way - about the exchanges is a good information - just saw the ad, but never tried to use an exchange. 3% is ok - either way BTC is never stable in no direction, so 3% is just a snapshot of a +7% or -12% day depending on the market phase.

And most of the "beginner" investors are sensitive to FUD and FOMO and usually buy high and sell low ... which explains the volatility in BTC a bit. Distribution of wealth attracts "Average Joe" not having a clue on investing and in some cases putting their life savings on the line ...

Google "bitcoin double spend" and follow the instructions to create an new transaction with the same keys to a different address - i doubt your transaction will be confirmed on both ends, so you should be fine.
Actually i don't know why the wallet didnt warn you ... if an address starts with 0x it is not BTC (just for future use).
