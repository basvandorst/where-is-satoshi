Past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes.

How many times do we need to be told to buy the dip before it falls yet again? I’m not one who’s warning that crypto is a scam or that Bitcoins will be worth pennies in a few weeks/months/years. 
But buying the dip and hodling doesn’t work if the overall trend is downwards. 
I’m selling up 75% and keeping the rest in BTC. Sure, it’s hedging my bets. But I get the best of both worlds that way.

Oh. That makes it okay then.

It’s like everyone forgot the mantra drilled into every two-bit, fresh out of university financial analyst:
Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
Sure, the reports of Bitcoin’s death have been greatly exaggerated. But it doesn’t mean Bitcoin is owed a comeback on that scale. Ignore the investors with bad timing who are clinging on, not wanting to turn a paper loss into a realised loss.

Well that was easy! I don't have much so I only donated a little, but it's the first time I've donated to Wikipedia.

So they have to get paperwork for each individual state but then they can operate worldwide? Odd that they need state-by-state papers but then not country-by-country.

There's no need to give it to a charity, just keep it for yourself.

Sorry, guys but... 
1 - your video is blocked in Germany because of the music  
2 - your site caused chrome to show me a warning about certificates  
3 - I have no idea what a notary or arbitration market is  
I still have no idea what's going on

Yeah but it still isn't as good enough as the system you're suggesting. You want there to be a reasonable spread of Bitcoin ATMs in every city, as well as making the purchase of Bitcoins as easy as clicking a PayPal button. 
I still don't understand why that last one isn't possible.

Same. I don't have much but wanted to both support Wikipedia and help show that if your company accepts Bitcoin then you can expect a good reaction from the BTC community

Being obnoxious to critical feedback is not going to help your cause

Only people who don’t need the liquidity say that

The delusion in this post is strong. “The bull market is coming! The bull market is coming!”
And then they see it sink and say “buy the dip”. FML
