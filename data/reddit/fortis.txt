A sticker isn’t adoption - It’s marketing...
Bitcoin was designed to be spent.

Well I haven't checked lately, but the Driod let you do all kinds of management and showed a summary. The iOS one had very basic features - It was largely useless when compared...

There was a token swap.

Why sell? If you need liquidity, check out the Visa Credit Card offering from Mobi via BTCC - seems like best case scenario....

Anybody else mystified how the big North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami STILL doesn’t accept bitcoin as payment?
And yes, I know they technically do - But only via a corresponding email request to ‘arrange’ it - seriously, WTF - who can take them seriously???

Do some research. Tom’s analysis in the past are incredibly well thought out and void of emotion - IMHO he represents one of the ‘good guys’ on Wall Street that actually understand the potential.

Um - That’s not how it works...

Great article and perspective. Unfortunately the crisis (trying to find the right word for what's going on down there) is an excellent catalyst for moving Bitcoin into more mainstream channels (and wealth store).
Can you think of any way that a fund could be setup to help the community or other people in need?

Wish it had the same capability on iOS that it has on Android.... :(
