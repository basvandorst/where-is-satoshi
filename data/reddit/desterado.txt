I mean if finding bitcoin is what’s keeping you afloat you need to make some other changes in your life. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:14:06
Care to state any specific examples like was asked?
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:56:33
Weird. I just backed up my cash today. It's called a bank!
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:11:36
Or he could get a money order, use escrow, wire transfer, etc. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:56:44
What a terrible waste of money....
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:26:00
I question the intelligence of someone who leaves 550 BTC sitting on a remote exchange. Pull it out if you're not trading. God damn....
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:57:08
Maybe it's wireless or NFC??
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:16:11
This is entertaining. I love how fast and loose everyone is with tens of thousands of dollars. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:15:16
I understand what you wrote, but do you really think a shitload of customers are going to leave over this?
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:10:33
It's called running a business. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:38:02
Charging .001 for drinks? Nice!
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:44:29
Here in NYC sometimes some places check twenties but everywhere else I never see it. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:16:08
Tell that to everyone internet company who uses it to transfer data. 
Perhaps people won't be making it off of bitcoin directly, but a secondary way. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:58:18
More stories of people being their own worst enemy with their passwords. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:06:52
Wallet security? You mean people using and then forgetting their wallet passwords and then posting about it?
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:08:26
Really? You REALLY think they're going to lose a "shitload" of clients because they'll require identification to make cash deposits?
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:28:45
Wait you mean a company will prevent you from using their services if you violate their terms of service? No way!
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:56:34
This is the future and the ford escape still looks new?
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:32:21
This is absurd. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:14:45
Isn't this what we wanted? It's unregulated!
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:08:04
There's this thing called a credit card that allows you to get money without having to transfer anything into your bit coin wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:28:27
No. I just don't see how having to show your drivers license to make a deposit is a big deal. Cause it's not. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:00:57
Clearly that's not enough. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:47:36
Check fedex and ups prices also. Those usps boxes are expensive unless you have a ton of weight in them. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:18:14
This is what happens when shut in nerds get money and get paranoid. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:27:37
Further proof that many people who make paper wallets are straight up idiots. 
They're absolutely not necessary for safe storage of your BTC. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:46:00
Uhh...no. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:09:34
Well you don't have the right to use a bank...
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:33:39
If he needs funds in an emergency then he wouldn't be using bitcoin anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:45:21
When you say years ago how many do you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:00:53
I bought a bunch of TF2 items with my coins. I would've rather had candy. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:31:35
I bet there's more to the story, or this person doesn't know you can keep your number.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:49:01
ATT broke the law then....
@_date: 2015-07-04 13:48:17
He's probably some 15 year old who thinks he knows everything 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:21:55
I'm planning on withdrawing my coins from coinbase. Does anyone have any wallets they can recommend for this upcoming issue. It's really confusing to me honestly. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:59:23
Eh, I bought a watch for like .25 years ago LOL.  Watch was like 400 USD at the time, whoops.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:27:27
Congratulations. How does this warrant a post?
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:49:07
Electrum seems like a good idea. Thanks 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:08:46
Tell that to my power company and my landlord and the gas station and my phone company. It's not liquid. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 06:36:51
Uh. They're referring to devices solely manufactured for the purpose of mining bit coins. 
You can sell cutlery on eBay. It can be used as a weapon. Yet eBay doesn't allow weapon sales. 
Your comparison is terrible but the circle jerk up voted it for some reason. 
I can make a bomb from ingredients at the store, but the store cannot sell bombs.  See what I am getting at?
@_date: 2013-09-30 04:12:51
Doesn't this defeat the purpose of btc
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:51:37
I would love to see someone try and make that much BTC into cash. Wouldn't happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:39:07
They're just being nice 
@_date: 2013-07-25 13:15:54
Cool. You ignored my point. GJ DUDE. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:20:40
When you use bitpay you, the vendor, aren't actually accepting the bitcoins yourself are you?  Bitpay just receives them and then sends you the cash, right?
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:13:08
Can I ask why?
Is everyone so arrogant that they think the government really cares what their personal individual conversations contain?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:21:33
What do you mean hit cap?
It's designed so that the amount of coins generated stops in the year 2140(?) I believe.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:38:25
ITT: Fools and money are soon parted. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:52:28
Probably because a huge portion of their customers would attempt charge backs constantly. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:38:24
Simple.com bank account?
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:23:36
While I agree that the early adopters are smart and earned it I wouldn't say they "worked their asses off". 
Smart people saw the risk as worth taking and made out on it. Simple as that!
@_date: 2013-10-13 05:56:11
More than likely it won't mean anything...ever.
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:59:17
It's virtual.
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:51:52
That's what I'm trying to say. He said 15% aren't done with cash. So still using cash but really it's 85% that are still using cash. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:11:34
I want it to stabilize, doesn't it need to stabilize before it can be really used as a currency?  I'm not much of an economist so this could be a wrong assumption.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:33:16
So basically bitcoin circle jerk
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:09:18
The amount of coins in a solved block went down to 25 earlier this year I think.  It halves approximately every 4 years I believe.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:01:07
Market cap on things like LTC and BTC are BS though aren't they? The moment anyone started withdrawing any significant amount the price would shoot down and the cap would be nothing in no time. Right?
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:36:50
It's a little more complicated than that. Unless you hire them as an independent contractor you're obligated by law, at least in the US to pay them in USD. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 17:11:03
So if they're not done with cash what are they using? Fingernail clippings?
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:23:56
It's not wrong. At this stage that's mostly what BTC is being used for. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:35:35
Wait what? How? I use them right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:09:47
Anyone who falls for this isn't tech savvy enough to even deserve to have a computer. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:41:30
Hmm. Weird. I went to Italy once and brought some local currency. It's not like you just wake up in another country. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:23:56
Tell that to my car insurance company, all the restaurants around me, the car dealership, the car repair shop, AT&amp;T, my landlord, the gas station, the grocery store, do you want me to keep going?
I fully support it being available as a payment mechanism in the future but RIGHT NOW it is severely limited. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:48:49
Yeah man. Screw those banks. Especially when you have to turn your BTC into...cash to basically use it anywhere else. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:02:53
WAIT I thought BTC was it's OWN currency, why are we comparing it to fiat!
It's NOT 40k, it's 445 BTC!
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:11:34
Quick question:  What happens if two miners solve the problem for the block at the exact same time?  Is it just a matter of who sends it out first against the timestamp or something?
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:14:00
Grocery store down the street cashes checks here.
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:48:14
No. He said the fifteen percent that are not done with cash. Aka using cash. Aka 85% not 15. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:09:40
People use bitcoin to pay for almost everything, maybe I'll post some information about different types of hot dogs then...
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:30:45
Love all these people that are going ape shit crazy encrypting their wallets and making paper ones.  You know there are easier and just as reliable methods of backing up data. Most of which don't require a brute force attack if you forgot the password. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:32:33
I was drawing a comparison that something can be sold for one purpose but used for another.
I never implied anything about mining was illegal. You inferred that to make your argument convenient for you I think. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:49:39
Everyone is voting me down but I don't understand. 85 percent are using cash. They are not done with cash. 15 percent ARE done with cash. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 17:22:38
Mind has been blown. Apologies all around. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:03:05
Sure there are, but have there been any attempts to make their BTC liquid?  What effect would that have on the market if someone were to cash out for a million or even a couple million?
I'd be shitting myself right now if I had even 500BTC, while a lot of folks are saying it won't crash, you never can be too sure with these things.
Also, if you did cash out a million dollars to your bank account, aren't there some legal/technical issues to consider, right?
I am assuming you can't just dump 500k or a million from MTgox into your account without a little bit of scrutiny from multiple eyes.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:25:41
That's irrelevant but alright. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:25:44
Would've been easy to give them seven dollars also. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:58:05
If the difficulty is one you'll get a block very quickly. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 06:38:51
I can murder people with a gun. Murder is illegal. Better not sell guns too?
Oh wait. No. PayPal has a problem with things being sold for the express purpose of mining. Kinda like how a gun store can't knowingly sell you a gun you intend to kill someone with. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:10:14
So? It's still largely anonymous. I can transfer 1000 BTC to an exchange or a wallet somewhere else in the world and slowly take BTC off of it ten at a time to a new wallet each time. Just because it's public doesn't mean it's easily traced. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:32:55
More proof that so many people who password their wallets are only protecting it from themselves. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:37:50
You mean the 15 that are done with cash. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:54:29
If 85% of transactions are done WITH cash, that means 15% of transactions are not done with cash.  So...85% are still using cash.
Unless by cash you are including card transactions, which that statistic doesn't seem to be inlcuding.
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:06:17
Didn't many people think of buying and didn't?
I remember I saw BTC back in 2009 and thought it was "stupid".  Boy was I wrong...
@_date: 2013-06-12 04:26:03
Can't you...mail a check?
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:34:22
I'm too lazy. Someone look up the value on this address. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:51:36
That's my thoughts exactly. It's not even three grand USD. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:40:39
There is a hard limit...I think my four year thing was wrong. It just ended up being four years the first time it dropped!
I think it'll vary depending on how quickly we go through generating the coins. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:57:38
How long can the early days last?  Seriously though, I am curious.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:35:54
It's a currency that as of now only holds value when exchanged for fiat, spare a few places that accept it as payment. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:36:28
Not really. It can easily be obfuscated. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:28:04
You guys are really drinking the Kool
Aid. Yes money laundering is associated with all currencies but due to the nature of bitcoin it is easier to launder....it's not an attack against it. It's just a fact. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 22:33:07
This is what happens when something is not regulated and answers to nobody. 
Love how everyone is down voting this but nobody can give me a valid response. Tools. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:18:50
Difference is with PayPal there is a channel to go through with fraudulent claims. There isn't with BTC.
