“Traditional market participants may be more skeptical of bitcoin than millennial day traders” aka traditional anything is antithetical to BTC and the crypto community and they are getting burned. Love this. 
Prepare thy selves for the new decentralized world otherwise BTC will eat your short positions and take everything from you!

Can't share obviously : ) Just keep an eye out over the next few weeks to see financial publishers talking about buying crypto in your banners. When you see that, you know that retail will be coming in full force shortly thereafter.

Forget the 1, 15, and 60 minute charts.  Zoom out. This pullback after a month long bull run is normal and healthy. Buy the dips for tickets to the moon and hold for the next 12+ months.

I work in digital advertising and can confirm that the largest financial publishing firms in the US are preparing several new products to promote crypto investments that will be released in the next few weeks. Since Facebook has recently overturned its ban on advertising crypto products, companies are positioning themselves to spend millions a month on Facebook ads. Think Altucher Crypto ads 2.0 bringing all the retail money into the sector. This, compounded with institutional funds and technology maturation, is going to push BTC to 75k-100K over the next 12-18 months.
