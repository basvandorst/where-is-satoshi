Not for mining. For the production of electrical offset. If your electric bill is normally $50, but with the addition of generated electrical offset, it is now $40, that would be $10 worth of produced energy. If it takes even a whole hour to produce one penny of offset, the cost dealing with the payment wouldn't be worth the penny. But this isn't a problem with bitcoin.

The key in your safe is only for that uncommon situation that your third-party company has failed you somehow. It would be unlikely that it would ever be needed. It does not need to be near you.
The agents are paid by you to play the gatekeeper, and are not to deal with customer issues (that could be a separate customer support number). Clog the lines? That doesn't even makes sense. It is a paid service (unlike most customer service). If there are more interactions there is more money coming in to the third-party company.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:35:12
With this sort of MultiSig setup you have ease of use, combined with a piece of mind that your money is safe. Let's say you knew you were going to be going on the town and were going to be spending about $100 in bitcoin that night. So you use your hyper-secure MultiSig system to transfer $100 worth of bitcoin to a hot-wallet, also on your phone. You could do this from your car in two minutes.
@_date: 2014-06-09 22:22:07
This wouldn't be for every transaction. This would be for loading a hot-wallet. You could literally store $10,000 on your phone with full assurance that it won't be stolen or lost. Then at any time you could video-chat for one minute to move $100 of that money to a hot wallet. Then if your phone were lost or stolen you would only be out $100, not $10,000.

@_date: 2014-06-07 22:05:39
But then it wouldn't be on your phone, and easy to access. You would have to go home to your safe to get the money before using it. Your idea is also less secure, if the safe is stolen, your money is gone.
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:02:52
You obviously choose a third-party company that has good customer service. If the company you choose has call center representatives that don't release the money when you have given adequate proof of your identity, you use the key in your safe to move the money to a different wallet using a different (more responsible) third-party company.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:39:51
Do you mean your regular banking app that sits on your phone that somehow hasn't been magically hacked? The beauty of a MultiSig system is your phone could be fully hacked and the 'bad guy' still couldn't use your money, nor prevent you from accessing it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:10:08
In theory the third-party company wouldn't even need to know your name. They would just need to know the MultiSig address associated to the account and have audio/video of you on file. Everything could be done over an encrypted channel with open source software.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:25:52
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:41:11
In the OP I stated "They would charge an appropriate transaction fee."
I don't need someone to manage my money. I only need someone to verify my identity.
I have worked in a call center before. I have worked in situations where each call could be for a different client, and in situations where I would only get calls from one client. How is it hard for an op to get a  vid-chat that is synced to the account so identity can be verified? Yes, some software would need to be written, but that is something people do for business. Software for streamline.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:46:03
Yes, this is the first iteration of MultiSig being made available. We need more services like these. I hope that in time the video verification idea becomes available. The cost per interaction with an operator is just pennies.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:34:32
This defeats the whole idea. By keeping your multi-sig off your phone you are now non-mobile. That is to say you now have to go home to spend your money. What I am describing let's people access thousands of dollars safely without needing to trundle home. The power of bitcoin is supposed to be that you can be anywhere. Apparently people think, anywhere is only at your PC.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:36:43
It is true that these services don't exist, yet. This is the year that MultiSig will begin being implemented into more and more systems. These kind of businesses are the new businesses that hopefully will be popping up soon. This is an area for new business development, which is a positive thing.
As far as the third-party not returning your key, that is the beauty of MultiSig; even if they evaporate the next day, you can still pull your money out with your two remaining keys.

I just began wondering this same question this week.  While I can't imagine it being something many people would demand there should be a few out there who would want this option.  There are a handful of exchanges that use ACH but they just use it for selling your bitcoins.  For those who don't know ACH is what banks use in the US to perform direct deposit operations.  ACH stands for Automated Clearinghouse.

BitMessage was designed to fragment into separate streams to deal with scaling issues. Since it is still small it is only at Stream 1. Decrypting every message is not computationally hard. It takes longer to download the messages than to attempt to decrypt them. BitMessage was designed to scale well.

It has been close to a month since I first placed my order with Bitspend. I would email to get resolution. They would reply. We would email back and forth, ultimately coming to a conclusion of what to do. Then they would do nothing. Nothing at all. I would email them back several times with no response at all. So I create a support ticket. Again the same behavior. All I want is my money back. Again Bitspend and I both reach the resolution that they should return the money to me. I give them the BTC address to send it to, and nothing. No action. No emails. Dead air. Not only has my time been wasted, but so has theirs.

Do you realize that the very act of watching a single 3 minute YouTube video involves your computer decompressing (which is almost the same as decrypting) large numbers of bits? I would imagine that one day worth of BitMessages would be equivalent to the computational work your computer does to decompress a 4 minute YouTube video. That is to say, not much work. Also note, that for scaling purposes, you would only need to decrypt any message sent to your stream (which now is Stream 1). The whole point of downloading all messages and only grabbing the ones that you can decrypt is so that the intended receiver is completely hidden, adding a never before seen level of security.

If the whole world only had one US dollar, and that one dollar was transacted 84 trillion times in the span of one year, the GWP would be $84 trillion. Things like GWP or GDP are very different than money supply. What you are looking for is World M2, or something like it. I have seen estimates of World M2 at $25 trillion. Considering that the lowest unit of bitcoin is a satoshi, and the eventual maximum number of satoshis will be 2,100 trillion satoshis, I think we will be just fine.

If you store $50 worth of BTC with them, they exchange that BTC to USD on their side and hold USD. They charge you the friction. They never have to register as a MSB because they aren't changing currencies on the client side (just internally). If the price of BTC suddenly drops to half its previous value, you still have $50 worth of BTC on account. When you want to get your money back, they exchange their USD ($50) back to BTC and pay you $50 worth of bitcoin. They then charge you friction for this. Yes there is risk that they will take-the-money-and-run so be aware of this risk.
