I know you’re getting downvoted, but I am American who is literally in India right now for a wedding and unless you see it, it can be hard for westerners to understand. The entire resort was rented for 3 days so 200+ guests can eat, drink and stay for free at the expense of the brides parents. This cost minimally hundreds of thousands of dollars. Less than a mile away there are hundreds of people sleeping in the street.
A lot of the animosity comes from the fact that India is very very heavily with bribery and corruption, and the wealthy disproportionately utilize this (ask anyone about anytime they were pulled over, arrested, etc). Not to mention savings accounts generate %8/annual while mortgages can top 10%, resentment towards the ultra wealthy who are only getting more wealthy utilizing the exact vehicles that are shafting the poor is pretty fair. Not the mention the obscene emphasis on family over everything and you can see how vast wealth travels within the family through supporting daily business ventures, inheritance, marriages within tight knit communities, etc. Never leaving the family.
I know I’m incredibly lucky in life. But when I get home I’m making a donation and changing my will to donate my funds to an NGO. This exposure changes you.

even if it worked, youd spend more on flights that you would on taxes.

It’s bcause the time period they’re auditing for was years ago, not this year.

So unless the price rises for forever and ever to infinity, OP is correct that there will be losers. There can’t just be winners.

So I’m a huge fan of bitcoin. Bought in 2012. Wrote my thesis on it before these booms brought attention to it.
But I think that if bitcoin is really going to be the currency of the future and end corruption in developing countries and hedge against inflation in Venezuela, etc etc we need to accept that a price of $16000 isn’t going to cut it. Again, HUGE supporter of bitcoin, but soon the conversation is going to have to be “is btc an investment vehicle or is it a currency”? 
I do think we haven’t reached ATH. But I also don’t think btc is going to be permanently this elevated, unless everyone just agrees to treat it like  speculative security.
My opinion, of course.

I can assure you airline tickets have nothing to do with btc capital gains payment.

I’ve withdrawn $10,000. I’m not sure what your point is.
