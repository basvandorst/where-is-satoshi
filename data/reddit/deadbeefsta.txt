What does it say when you call out biggest criminal in existence today and get down voted? First they ignore you, then Jamie Dimon laughs at you, then they fight you... and then you win.

And buying litecoin?

I love true beleeders.

Surely you're not basing your money decisions on the small transactions taking longer to be included in a block without paying a super premium to have them included? Surely you're not worried about how the total of 1mb size for transactions will be affect by the multitude of 9 years olds running with three dollars in their hands?

It is possible. Not a world I want to have anything to do with, but they could try to do.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:36:54
Still working on it. Be patient.

There is nothing they can do. Just like they can't stop piracy or any other digital goods. Underground, possibly. The day will come when the U.S. banks are affected in some way and the U.S. then labels it terrorist money, but even that won't stop it.

LOL. It's not like they are too big to fail. /s

Wells Fargo and any too big to fail bank are well beyond being the "act rational to them" phase. They have no need or desire to act rational to anyone else anymore. These banks are scum that deserve no respect and the faster they lose control of their system the faster we can all appreciate the benefits of the new one.

But you can't stop it. Just like you can't stop bitcoin, you can't stop any other altcoin. If bitcoin is going to survive it has to weather any and all competitors, and that's if you want to really consider them as direct competitors.

No doubt, the US dollar in the shape of a raccoon.

I was told we're going back to uBTC. Not sure what that means, but whatever I'm told, LOL. Can't wait to buy more so I can play more shashumi dice. Damn, why does it take two weeks to buy more Bitcoin?

It's very entertaining.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:13:22
OMG this is not good!

You know what they said of the California gold miners, right? The people selling shovels made the millions not the miners. Rememberer that when using any services, including buying mining ASIC devices.

Hold on, I will have that one figured out in about 2^256-1 years.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:14:25
Plenty of frogs are just starting to realize it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:30:18
Like what? Finding out you're a victim of a double spend because the hash hoard didn't include you in their block within the last ten hours?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:59:56
LOL. Who makes this decision, some website? Look at it any way you want. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:14:47
That's like saying someone with an iPhone owns an Android tablet. LOL. We all know that's impossible. /s
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:29:59
Authority or no authority, it's a moot point. It can't be regulated. It's impossible. But they will try. The day they try to is the day that marks the beginning of the end, and I don't mean for bitcoin, but for the too big to fail banks. Interesting times ahead.

The crux is that the price isn't driven buy people wanting to buy things, it's driven by people wanting to hold it as an investment. While holding as an investment it would be wise to do so in paper form, not with some online wallet website.
