is there actually a coin called shitcoin?
edit: [yes](
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:11:52
yeah, lucky us, we only invested what we could afford to loose
i made the $25k from selling pixels in a video game and my parents still pay for everything so it was ok if i ended up with nothing or ended up with a million
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:31:42
that's only like $2000
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:23:25
id guess at least 90% of the people who internet have at least heard of bitcoin

this is why bitcoin acceptance will grow exponentially, once someone accepts bitcoin, it is in their best interest to promote it as the price of bitcoin is almost solely based on acceptance, them getting more people to accept it only increases their profits
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:25:57
at least now his phone won't end up on the used market and someone out there will have to buy a new iphone from apple

bits for tits
coins for groins
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:57:06
dude, a little over a year ago, i had 25k i was perfectly willing to spend on bitcoins so that would have gotten me 2100 just like you, i had 20 bitcoins already that I actually still have now so i know i wouldn't have sold them before i had over a million dollars, i felt so bad for being too lazy to actually get verified on mtgox and buy the coins when a few months ago i was buying coins for $900 from coinbase, now that i think about it though, if i had ended up buying them from mtgox over a year ago i probably would have ended up like you loosing 2100 bitcoins instead of having the 70 i was able to buy through coinbase, now it dosn't feel so bad
@_date: 2014-01-22 03:08:39
lol why the fuck would coinbase give you bitcoins for brb no tracking and proof of delivery chargeback money
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:43:32

@_date: 2014-02-25 07:15:37
a little over a year ago, mtgox was basically the only option for buying coins. i still remember i was gonna buy around 2100 coins for $12 each but was too lazy to do all that verification shit. lucky me, because i still have all my bitcoins from that time period meaning i would probably have lost 2100 coins today.

@_date: 2014-02-06 21:59:47
actually, the phone before it was shot 9 times, could have been sold for money which could then be used to purchsae a very effective bitcoin device. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:26:34
lol mtgox always has been a steaming pile of shit，anyone else remember back in April when they had like 6 hours of trading lag

if only we coulda got dj khaled to let us use the stronger servers then bitcoin would still be online

@_date: 2017-01-04 22:41:03
how does this work if i have no feedback
also are there people willing to buy hundreds of bitcoins? and how do i even do a trade for like a million in cash
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:04:30
same, ready to drop $25k at $12 but too lazy to do the mtgox verification
shitty thing is im still holding everything from 2012, good thing is i might have left everything on mtgox
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:54:57
if you max ira then max your 401k too, after that crypto is a good gamble
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:23:51
they could at least get gbtc
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:56:46
reason i got into bitcoin in 2012 was because fuck paypal
sold virtual goods for paypal and would get chargebacked constantly, pay like 3% fee, get my funds held for no reason for weeks, and get account suspended 
then i switched to bitcoin and all the problems went away but accidentily made me rich
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:22:02
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:14:36
yeah im just wondering whats the best place without sell limits, so if i decide to sell i can get it instantly and just wait the few days for banks transfer
used coinbase but they have $10k sell limit per day i think
not gonna sell just trynna find the best exchange so i can do all that verification beforehand
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:55:22

1 mil is not hitting it big
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:50:42
i think irs will see if i get a $1 mil deposit into my bank account. i have no use for money either but since im only 24, if i cash out and put everything in index fund i should still end up with over $10 mil when i retire. thats enough for me and any future generations of my immediate family to live off or at least not worry about money.

@_date: 2017-07-21 06:09:52
gemini, took like 3 days i think for me to get verified and actually buy
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:53:11

@_date: 2017-07-21 00:49:17
i used to do martingale on satoahi dice starting with like .1 btc bets which was like $1 at the time
made a few btc before quitting and still have them

you low key savage af told that dude what a dumbass he is 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:50:36
and then another time
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:02:11
used to sell virtual goods because 0 chance of chargeback
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:15:10
how much
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:01:51
if you just want coffee, what's wrong with traditional methods of payment? you have to buy coffee in person which dosnt really utilize bitcoin's defining  "anywhere in the world instantly" feature 
when i got into bitcoin in 2012, it was originally because i was selling digital goods for hundreds or thousands of $ to people around the world and bitcoin was the only guaranteed way of not getting chargebacked. i also didn't have to pay paypal a 3% fee or worry about them holding my funds for a month every time they felt like it. today, the reasons i originally got into bitcoin still hold true, only difference is i have to pay an extra dollar.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:58:42
lol yea, and i was mining with a shitty laptop like .01 btc a day
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:49:20
what is wrong with merchants using one wallet to accept payments? i realize they can't go back in time so they have to pay the fees on all their existing wallets but going forward if they just use one or a few wallets to accept payments, wouldn't their fee problem be solved?
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:10:51
yea, i used the bitcoinfees.21 site to calculate how much id be willing to pay for the speed i wanted. it's literally supply and demand for block space. the fact that blocks are full means plenty of people are still willing to pay at the current price. im more scared of the day when blocks are empty and miners have no fees to pay them to continue mining.
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:45:23
bought 10 at $900 yesterday and almost dumped 60 at $550 a few hours ago lol but then i thought to myself, what would jesus do, and he saved me once again
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:26:50
the only way it heads there though is if people are still willing to pay more
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:31:06
it is, you buy bitcoins through the magic the gathering online exchange (Mt.Gox)

@_date: 2013-11-17 18:34:20
i actually did buy 20 of them for $12, I had $25k to spend on them and no problem doing it as I knew they would go up in value. Basically I'm not a millionaire right now because I forgot to buy more.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:59:17
sucks to be me then, i bought 20 at $12 and was willing to spend another $25k than let it rot in the bank making 0.8% but forgot to. i still have those original 20 bitcoins

last bitcoin will be generated in 2140 so there will probably be well less than half of the total bitcoins left, but like 99% of bitcoins will be generated by 2030 so the number of bitcoins will still be going up at least for the next 10 years before it actually starts declining

but how important really is sending $5? there's plenty of other methods to send your friend $5 with no fee. i remember in 2012 i would do martingale on satoshidice starting with like .01 bitcoin bets, worth like 25 cents at the time. i probably did thousands of these which i could because fees were so insignificant at the time. those transactions were basically just me spamming the network for something i didn't really care about. i think at the time satoshidice made up like 90% of all transaction volume. nowadays the fees weed out all the tiny useless transactions and you actually have to decide carefully which transactions are important and worth the fee.

@_date: 2013-11-26 07:58:58
if your transaction is really really small it will take a while
if you're transferring 100,000 bitcoins im sure it will be instant even without a fee
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:00:49
lol, the entire market cap is under $10 billion, so easy a 12 year old could do it if they saved up their allowance, that's why bitcoin  is just getting started
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:07:27
but fdic yo, dat fdic 100% money back gurantee gotta be worth somethin
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:22:31

i've made over a bitcoin doing martingale on satoshidice but eventually i quit because i knew in the very long run, I had a 100% chance of loosing everything. most people who gamble get addicted and don't know when to stop.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:10:37
you need to diversify yo coins nigga
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:00:10
speculation is necessary to drive prices up and gain attention, more people buy in and adopt bitcoin, even when it pops this time i suspect many more people will buy in when it's cheap and drive the price back up much faster than it took this time around
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:52:22
yeah, we're in the stealth phase

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:20:37
I'm pretty sure every major drop recently has been caused by mass dumpings by a single person. Either a drug dealer needs to cash out or a pretty large online vendor that accepts bitcoin decides it's payday.

Either way, then this is just a PSA for coinbase users, you are not guranteed immediate withdrawal of your bitcoins to your super secure paper wallets, you will have to have them stuck on coinbase for who knows how long.

@_date: 2013-12-04 00:39:15
idk, i thought i deposit the bitcoins in the buyers localbitcoins account, but he has to get a release code from me for him to actually get the bitcoins. that way i don't have to bring my computer wallet to the deal and risk getting my wallet stolen?

trust is hard to build, there's a reason coinbase has so many prominent employees, has paid out thousands of dollars to hackers that find flaws in their system, received a $5 million dollar investment, has 2 factor authentication, keeps 90% of coins in cold storage, and most importantly has been around for a while 
contrary to half the posts on this subreddit saying coinbase jacked their shit, the majority of users have never had a problem

you don't have to be a pro, all you need is a couple million $ at the moment and you can raise the price well over $100, than selling off a couple million at the new inflated price causes every tom, dick, and harry to panic sell at a loss so you can buyback those coins at the cheaper price again, rinse and repeat, the rich get richer, the dumb get poorer
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:09:01
seriously, ive got 50 bitcoins and i stopped giving a fuck a long time ago, unless i'm a millionaire im not sellin, it's obviously not gonna happen today or this week, but it very well might happen next year or in 10 years. save yourself the stress and delete bitcoinity from your bookmarks, if you bought bitcoin, you knew it was a gamble. if you truly believe bitcoin is the future of currency, then who gives a fuck if a couple speculators who bought yesterday pussied out today because their investment lost value after a whole day.

I would go with burial method, if you bury deep enough, it will really deter you from being a pussy and selling and also deter metal detectors. This is the reason why there are so few people who found their million dollar stash of bitcoins after 2 years, way to easy to sell them before they matured.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:36:51
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:37:55
i agree, 5 bitcoins is perfect, as bitcoins becomes more popular and increases in value, more people will try to hack and people who report flaws will get higher reward
also google pays up to $20k for hacking them

but 10% is still a lot
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:45:20
the rising value is not counterproductive. with a market cap of only $10 billion every rich tom dick and harry can cause the price to fluctuate drastically with only a few million $. when bitcoin is $100,000 it will be much more stable as you will need billions of $ to change the price. the reason bitcoin isn't to the cash register yet is because of the volatility.

a dollar bill has a length of 6.14 inches
the distance to the moon is 238,900 miles
it would take 2,465,261,238 dollar bills to go the moon
bitcoin PASSED THE MOON ┗(°0°)┛
EDIT: Thank you for the gold, I hope you bought me that with lunar bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:23:24
you probably wasted tens of hours making $1
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:27:28
so why would anyone decide to loose money on something that no one has ever made less than 1000% on if they held for over a year? billions of people put their money in the bank to make under 1% right now, I don't see what's so hard about not selling.

i always buy bitcoins in tens, cant stand the ones digit being anything other than 0 for some reason. also since i buy from a savings account i only get 6 transactions a month so that could be another reason

you cant get your shit out of gox though, the only reason people still use mtgox is because they are willing to wait a few months to get their money if they can sell higher

$7000 aint shit lol when the government is gonna take $300000 of that
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:42:12
$1000 per coin is extreme by any standard when people used to spend 10000 on a pizza
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:17:29
you only lost around $15,000 
all you can do is remember that so it doesn't happen next time

you probably didnt pay a fee
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:09:00
they could just return it and get a refund, that "no returns" shit dosn't mean jackshit, a buyer can get a refund as long as they return it
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:57:04
why has uncle sam not done this? if not just to fuck around with bitcoin, considering the fed creates that much out of nowhere every **hour**
also, im assuming the buy would have to happen all at once which would prevent sellers from adjusting their prices quickly enough
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:46:01
ten million
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:25:27
it will take 40 years to mine 98% of the last bitcoin and the end of time to mine the other 2%, so yeah one bitcoin could be worth a lot someday

why is bitmit shutting down
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:27:47
the chance of you downloading someone elses wallet is smaller than justin bieber's dick so you most likely were mining 4 years ago and forgot about it or something
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:47:48
do you know what i just realized? by the time the final bitcoin gets mined, half of them will prob be gone forever so the amount of bitcoins right now is prob the most there ever will be
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:39:54
im in it to make money but i also believe in it so im keeping 60 until jesus comes back, it's hard for nonbelievers to make money  as they're the ones buying at the peak and selling when it crashes to half that
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:43:51
actually no they wouldn't since 90% of coins people store with coinbase are in cold storage
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:00:59
im pretty sure it only follows bitstamp and adds a fee on top
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:11:41
