yeah your right gox doesnt have anything to do with bitcoins. What was I thinking?

i think he left the country a week ago.

yes government is going to make it all better, just like they fix everything after the bailouts, 911, homeland security, healthcare, the nsa, the fda, fcc, cia, epa...

yeah but in japanese he said the coins were gone and sorry about it.

whether you like it or not, the first time that many people heard about bitcoin was through the failure of gox, which hasn't been all sussed out yet. but you guys can sit in your bitcoin bubble, pretending its all ok. heck people losing money was popcorn to a lot of people here. Im just sick of people saying its all about community and shit when its really all about greed here. 
you cant just sweep shit under the rug, people will still smell the stink

yeah i would agree with this. those protester are not the problem. its the japanese mafia i would be worried about. I would guess by a day or two he jumped ship. I hate to say it but if I was in his shoes I would be sending money back home and getting on a plane buying time with these bullshit updates. but then again you would think an employee would come out by now.

this kool-aid taste great! To the moon! DOWNVOTE PESSIMIST, I FEEL A RALLY COMING ON!

A more important discussion is how to prevent similar failures going forward with exchanges that are still around.
dont see alot of that discussion going on. just alot of to the moon crap and shut up to negative outcomes to bitcoin.

not if he knew he had a certain amount of time. If thats the case he already left the country.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:46:04
because losers hate losing and cry for their mommy for their own mistakes. just like the big bank bailouts.

whats done is done. time to move on. hold on to it and wee what happens. markets go up and down. But I will tell you one thing. If everyone dwells on this and and becomes all depressed about bitcoin, that is what it will be, a depressing currency or despair. But if you just let it ride out, support the currency it may go up. People that bought in to it for a quick scheme forget it, in time I believe it will become a commodity like gold. hold on to it for a long time, buy some when you find it affordable. this is just the beginning
