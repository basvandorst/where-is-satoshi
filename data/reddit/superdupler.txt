Just got this on my FanDuel too. Winning is a whole bitcoin. Pretty cool

Congrats! I’m sure a lot of people will tell you that you should have kept hodling but I know it feels good to have secured those gains

You should personally sell then if that’s the quote you want to make your bitcoin analysis around. Or you can actually educate yourself on the currency and form your own opinion.

This whole post makes much more sense to me after reading this comment. Good luck.

You stated you bought bitcoin with your $950 originally. Then you paid for the iPhone in bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with what you did, you can do whatever you want with your money. But, it really does sound like you’re trying to convince yourself that you made the right decision. Obviously at this time right now it would have been smarter to keep the investment in bitcoin considering how much it has skyrocketed today. 
My advice: Just enjoy using your new iPhone and don’t use the Reddit app for a couple of days. You’ll be much happier

It depends on what community you’re looking at. If you really think that the entire bitcoin community lives on reddit then you’re sadly mistaken. Bitcoin is still in its very early stages of adoption. Not everyone is an expert on the matter, but just because Joe Schmo decided to jump on the bandwagon doesn’t mean that the currency is overvalued. If you’re worried about a correction happening after this recent surge then by all means go ahead and sell. Chances are that it will go back down. Just hope you have enough time to hop back on the train when it recovers
