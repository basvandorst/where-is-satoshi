Everything is speculation at this point.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:15:19
I might as well look at it this way. Really wish gox was more cooperative with the bitcoinica liquidator, those coins are still stored on mtgox.
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:22:42
I have already reported the developer to google play. He cant do this.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:59:44
I guess we will find out when he secretly gains access to the internet in prison...

I do use it for arbitrage. I dont have much to use but Im making a small profit.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:20:32
I would thank kaneira because this is the best advice you can get in this sub-reddit.

If ASIC miner should force investors to buy back shares directly from them with FIAT and watch as the prices goes back down to a reasonable level.
@_date: 2013-07-30 01:13:50
How do you like it now that the developer has decided to disable the app unless you buy a subscription?
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:06:47
If you don't have 2FA call this a stupidity tax. Learn from others mistakes.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:48:34
Buy on localbitcoins with cash. Find someone taking cash deposits at a bank near you. I can recommend a vendor for chase if needed.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:48:34
It has been taking me about 2 days to withdraw 
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:21:45
How fitting is it that some Parrot is squaking about bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:44:16
Are you fucking kidding me?

This Guy was pretty awesome to deal with. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 01:11:24
How do you feel about the application you bought forcing you to ask for a refund and buy back again at a higher price?
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:11:36
Well this looks like a recipe for a price dip!

My coins never left the gox wallet. this is what people forget. The hacker deleted user info and by the time it was recovered all parties walked away from the situation and none of the money was returned.
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:35:31
Looks like a pump
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:52:12
I was willing to hear you out on this service peercover but your responses are horrible. This community has trust issues and your lack of professionalism with regard to responses is not helping gain trust. It looks sketchy
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:22:02
Month isnt over bud. Join in on the greed but remember that bitcoin was less than $20 not very long ago.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:00:47
BRAKES! ITS BRAKES. Breaking is used like this "I BREAK YOU!". Brakes is used like this, "I slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting a mountain goat!".
@_date: 2013-07-30 01:12:22
Do you appriciate that the developer is trying to force you to ask for a refund and pay more for the app on a subscription basis?
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:48:58
The burden of proof is on you.

Mtgox is only so high because fiat is locked up and people need to buy btc to get money out. When the fiat flood gates open i suspect we will see around $70.

Doesn't work. Lowes wont refund in cash from a giftcard. They will only reload the card if you return an item.
@_date: 2013-07-30 01:14:31
Thank him for now forcing you to ask for a refund and to buy the application back at a higher price for a limited time???
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:35:30
Wow, hitting the bottle early today huh?
@_date: 2013-08-11 04:50:27
lol, people are so invested in BTC here that you cant get a realistic answer.
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:16:19
Oh, I'm taking more than $500 at a time. Its all in USD and sometimes Its on a daily basis. Its taken about 3 days though. Its being withdrawn to my bank.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:50:42
Its called an exchange because it is a place for people to exchange bitcoin for Fiat or the other way around.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:40:42
I have had one delayed by 6 hours (when instant is enabled) and that pissed me off but thankfully it went through .
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:46:06
I gotta raise my prices due to the risk of fraud. Chase will chargeback check deposits and chase quickpay if anything gets through the cracks and i get scammed. How high and mighty of you for disassociating your LBC username from your reddit one. I guess that makes you harder to track down when you scam someone huh?
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:22:58
Bitcoinity knows how much is owed to whom but mtgox is refusing to disperse funds to the liquidator in charge of sending out the coins. Once every 6 months a statement comes out from the liquidator with new information and so far that is where we were. Those coins are going to sit on gox until it goes out of business in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:40:03
Two Factor Authentication: its a second random password needed to log-in and/or withdrawl funds. It means someone can have your account password and still not be able to gain access to your account because only you would have the 2FA password (generated on phone)
@_date: 2013-10-06 00:14:51
I don't know if it matters but i use a credit union.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:44:51
Sounds like you have some form of it. Great job!

So what happened to being fair to BETA customers. You are forcing them to pay for a subscription or ask you for a refund... Dick move in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:50:44
Personally, I can only think of one person I know who doesn't have a smartphone and that's my grandma. She shouldn't be on mtgox anyways..
Yes, because Bitcoin isnt primarily used by technical people. Keep dreaming if you think grandma is going to go to mtgox and buy some coins.

Wrong, its like saying. someone broke into your house? Why didnt you use the free service to weld all of your entrances shut to prevent the theft?
2fa is free and makes it almost impossible to get into your account. Not using it means you are either lazy, stupid or ignorant.
@_date: 2013-07-30 01:13:01
On top of that, the developer is comming fraud by disabling the app unless you ask for a refund and buy it again at a raised price...
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:35:29
Localbitcoins is actually the best thing for bitcoin. Why should an exchange deserve 0.55% or 0.2% of my money just to run a piece of code for a fraction of a millisecond after i hit the send/sell button?
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:41:35
I used the guy and he was fast. He insisted I send him a picture of the deposit receipt before he released funds but as soon as i sent it it worked!
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:54:30
Thanks people. I sucked up the courage and made a purchase. The cash bank deposit is the way to go!
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:27:55
yes its safe, make sure to use 2FA to be extra careful.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:30:56
its only safe if you activate 2FA (2 factor authentication). Otherwise might as well give us all your money right now...
@_date: 2013-08-18 19:41:20
Last i heard, the liquidator was trying to convince mtgox to release funds. Mtgox refuses, maybe we need to group together and get gox to release funds.
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:13:39
My landlord.
@_date: 2013-07-15 00:33:52
Is anyone able to use this app?
@_date: 2013-07-31 16:44:17
I have been getting a couple grand out every week without issue. I hear others are having issues but I really could care less. Arbing bitstamp/gox every week is great!
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:21:07
Ha, It took so long to get verified at mtgox that I moved since I started. I ended up sending new documents to verify my ID &amp; new address and they denied it because it doesn't match previous documents i sent them, makes sense except its literally impossible to remove older documents sent to gox for verification. Its been more than 4 weeks since I emailed them back about this and no response. I have officially lost faith in Gox.
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:51:05
I'm just saying that you are cutting out the middle man. Traditional exchanges only exist because the internet didn't exist then. Everything is going to a distributed system. No more centralization.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:03:40
Please no cyber begging. There are places on reddit to get monetary assistance and this is not one of them.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:50:20
maybe its just bitcoin.
