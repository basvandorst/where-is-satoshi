Even if there are no “significant” walls, it seems that the prices are not moving as much as expected... :(

I am a HODLER, but part of me would like to have (more) expressive gains before Christmas (:
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:13:49
I am proud to be a HODLER 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:43:31
Are you guys still bullish about the BTC value on Monday? These walls do not want to fall down :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:30
Well, I am hodling at least until the fork... I have to admit, I am afraid as hell, but history has been good to hodlers, so I am here to win (and ready to lose)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:14:16
Fuck the futures

He is your moon :)

Here in Brazil few people had heard about Bitcoin since the beginning, but in the last couple of weeks there has been a “boom” of people wanting to invest because of the price rise... as a result, all the major exchanges (which are in small volume if compared to the largest ones in the US) have not been able to meet the demand and have huge delays, they take days to verify your accounts, etc.

I am a hodler and a believer, but it hurts to see my money decreasing :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:05:24
I don’t understand people that are afraid because BTC is at its lowest level since Saturday 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:43:08
HODLERS to the moon
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:45:14
I feel so sorry for my coworkers that had bought Bitcoin last week and sold them already. They know nothing about the moon ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:28:03
Actually these are my coworkers that are doing some crazy trading stuff. I am just glad that BTC is already recovering itself from yesterday 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:06:11
They even buy, go the gym during lunch and then sell when they are back... they like to think they are traders, but the volume is so low it is not worth the stress IMO

I couldn’t agree more: family first and I am so happy for your mother! I hope she likes the gift and the story :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:49
Should I hodl or sell? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:21:22
But I see so many green warriors... I hope they beat the 18k wall!!!

Amazing article: it has China (bad guys), fuel fossils (bad guys), coal (super bad guy) and Bitcoin (the worst of all)
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:12:05
the adrenaline must be amazing when the prices are going up and up and up
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:31:01
w-o-w. 50% in a couple of months is just crazy, i hope this continues for sometime
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:09:18
more or less... I have always been a reddit reader, but decided to give it a try today ;)
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:51:14
Yeah... I have an ex-boyfriend who started to invest in bitcoin by 2013, I think I should have followed him on that one :(
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:42:00
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:54:14
Today I woke up with it beating 25,000 BRL and I was like "\o/", but then it started to fell hard and I was like "is it really going to crash down NOW that I am into this? ¬¬". I don't know if I have the guts for the everyday pricing-rallys
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:52:29
Yeah, I imagine how this must cause regret XD
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:59:13
I hope you'd profit much more on a nearby future!
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:31:56
I haven't read much about ETH or other cryptocurrencies... are they really a thing as well?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:18:44
I hope I get the money and the man ;)
