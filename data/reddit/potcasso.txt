If bitcoin is the future, then explain how it’s going to scale because with the current $4 transaction fee I don’t get it

But who's the ocean?

Bitcoin has trouble scaling. Transactions are slow and expensive. To address that a lot of people want bigger blocks. Lightning enabled by segwit isn't a complete solution to the scaling problem because users will still need to open/close side chains which will require on-chain transactions. So a lot of people were seeing segwit2x as bitcoin's only hope towards an actual scaling solution. But it got cancelled so people (and businesses) are realizing bitcoin is never going to scale properly and jumping ship to other cryptos.

I understand why you felt panicked. Bitcoin was losing value and you couldn't sell even if you wanted to because the blocks were full and processing at half the usual speed. It was hyperinflation all over again.

Just to name a few last week Monero went from 85 to 120, dash from to 260 to 340, iota from .35 to .50

Sounds like you're trying to reassure yourself with a good conspiracy theory.

Excellent post. In that spirit, we should ask the moderators of this sub to make their moderation logs public, so we can debate fairly.
