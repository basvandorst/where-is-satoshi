That’s the slickest atm I’ve ever seen ��
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:39:23
It is still an option to buy bitcoin on every single coin star. You CANT trade coins for bitcoin yet . I am out here in boulder Colorado and   I can send pics later 
 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:14:34
Exactly, buying now is a bargain ��
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:14:26
I am with you man! I just tripled my Genesis Vision bag! I have more gvt now then I ever thought I would ☺️
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:22:24
You are right, he might not be!! But it’s pretty hard to believe he doesn’t own at least a little! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:57:03
Thank you sir, I just remember being really mad at myself for not buying at these low prices months ago. And here we are!! I would hate myself if I don’t buy right now or dollar cost average.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:58:51
I sold all my fiat for Bitcoin and gvt! And I still think I don’t have enough ��
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:15:31
Absolutely nothing �� he is just an investor.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:05:18
You are a moron lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:57:26
I want to find the fat fuck and beat his ass 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:04:29
Thanks for the advice man, never heard that one before. You are not going to get anywhere without a little risk bud. Just sayin 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:19:59
Yeah people don’t see opportunities when they sit right in front of their face. Instead they get all negative and just start complaining. When in reality they are uncertain and unsure about what to do next.

But my Uber driver said I was going to be super rich off tron and we would all be driving lambos. True story.

It’s crazy how everyone was okay with buying bitcoin at 7k-10k and now think it’s a terrible idea To invest at 3k?  I think the one that needs to see a therapist is you sir :) what people don’t understand is the prices are low like this for a reason. There is a lot of new developments going on and crypto is making huge leaps. Crypto itself is moving forward. YOU guys don’t see all the positive things that happen with crypto. All you see is the price and freak out. I am sorry to say it gentleman but you ARE part of the herd ��

It’s a the dry cleaners right in front of king scoopers on 30th!!
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:07:08

@_date: 2018-12-05 14:42:35
