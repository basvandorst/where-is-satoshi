That Gulf residents are pumping lots of money into BTC is great, but if I may, your title is a bit misleading.  Islam has 5 major schools of thought (Hanafi/Shafi'i/Maliki/Ja'fari/Hanbali, ranked by size of following population - not including some minor ones accounting for the other &lt;1%) whose scholars are heeded for these matters, and already Turkey's Religious Ministry (Diyanet, which is largely Hanafi) actually forbade BTC transactions.  The links you post are just of some random Arab newspaper and a dude in Kuwait; it's not like the scholars gathered around their table, nodded their heads and stamped some papers for the masses to follow. 
As I'm no scholar, I won't comment on whether it is halal or not, but I don't see a reason why BTC as a store of value, even if highly volatile, violates the shari'ah.  God knows best.

No, not right.

* 1 - doesn't matter
* 2 - doesn't matter
* 3 - doesn't matter
* 4 - doesn't matter
* 5 - doesn't matter
* 6 - no one limited things to 4 or even 5.
you're having a conversation with your own mind in public.  i encourage you to focus on a topic being discussed rather than to go on tangents.  like it or not, tullabu l-'ilm study the deen through schools of thought today.  you may not like that but it is today's reality.  if you want the original, study physics and build a time machine.  you can go to any school you'd like.

* 1 - Fake lols never help make a point.  There is Ja'fari.  - includes ja'fari (and more), and was endorsed by Taqi Usmani, Qaradawi and Bin Bayyah to name a few.  
* 2 - I'm not describing what is right, just what is
* 3 - You're losing context again. 
* 4 - At this point it is apparent you have an axe to grind around the issue of madhahib.  I am making no assertion regarding the validity of its prescriptivity, but rather that among the scholarly community, this seems to be the consensus.

I don't care how many shills come on this thread.  CNBC will still take the cake for the biggest shill of them all.  I'm pretty sure they single handedly boosted IOTA's market cap by billions of dollars.
