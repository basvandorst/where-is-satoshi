We are working on that ;-)

As of binary, actually the submit rate is set to about 3-5 seconds. It's important to understand that we want reduce each miners hashrate variance and that can only be done by setting diff levels so that we achieve the above submit rate.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:02:02
Incentives: Bandwidth efficiency - you as a miner can operate on not-so-great connection. This makes some space for higher submission rates on the poolside which in turns reduces variance in miner's hashrate (and thus reduces variance rewards in score based, PPLNS and the like rewarding schemes)
Timeframes: There is now a baseline for reference implementation in the repository (currently being updated to the latest spec). The document is a request-for-comments. My estimate is at least 3-5 months to address any issues. As of the implementation - the mining part is fairly straightforward. Farms can use V1-&gt;V2 proxy on sight and pools may also deploy V2-&gt;V1 as their first level of adoption before implementing the support directly into stratum.

(EDIT) I am assuming you are asking about complete capitulation... If miners capitulate we would have a nice proof bitcoin is a failure and probably any other cryptocurrency project is meant to fail. I am positive that bitcoin incentives are set so that we would always have big enough securing of the network that corresponds (follows) the current price.
Partial capitulation is normal part of the feedback loop in the system that sets incentives for the miners to participate in the system and if these incentives are not strong enough part of them goes away, reducing the network difficulty and so on and so forth until the system finds another steady state.

RSK mining was experimental, for the 2 years we have mined something around 1.5 BTC that partially covers our development/operation cost.. now the  RSK has restructured miner rewards, we will look into it but I cannot give you any good timeline for this.

I have tried covering the hw here: [
As of Bitmain specifically, the new range of products has very good efficiency that matches the specs. It pretty much obsoletes all S9's. What is not so good about Bitmain and other manufacturers is the lack of transparency, violation of GPL and recent lockout of users from their machines (aka no more ssh access). This attitude essentially proves that if you can't control your firmware you can't really control your miner (aka NOT YOUR FIRMWARE, NOT YOUR MINER).

We can see Bitmain, Canaan, Whatsminer/MicroBt, Bitfury. As of the future, chances are the comoditization of ASIC's could eventually happen the more players step into the game. The barrier to step into ASIC design is still pretty high and involves a lot of risk. Specifically the risk of failing to deliver at spec and on time is what repels investors to step into the mining ASIC manufacturing business

I will try to cover the technical points:
1. zipping is a possible,  the problems that I see with this approach:
* zipping message field names would save space, however, you can completely eliminate these names by defining a record based format with defined field types
* zipping remaining data (e.g. nonces/extranonces/hashes)  would not bring much as this data is completely random with uniform distribution.
With binary protocol based on variable length fields you eliminate the above issues completely. If we were to chose json-like protocol we would probably go with msg pack. However, we still believe that space here is at premium considering the amounts of data that is being sent via the protocol. Therefore, we should literally consider every single byte (please, see the comment in the doc, even questioning the size of the channel ID. The 4 bytes dedicated to channel ID's seem currently an overkill and will likely change to 2-3 bytes once it receives broader review)
2. The spec outlines the intention to use Noise Protocol Framework that is primarily a specification and formalism for designing crypto protocols with (optional) authentication. It has been proven by academic circles and in our opinion is becoming a standard for these matters. We have chosen the 'NK' handshake that requires the mining server to authenticate itself by presenting a public key. And now I am getting to the remaining issue that needs to be solved. We have to agree how this public key will be secured from MITM. It will most likely have some signature attached from the central pool authority. The current rough idea is that users will be able to download central pool authority public key from its website/may receive it by other channels/maybe part of the URL and configure such authority key in their mining proxy or even in the physical mining devices (less likely). Peter Todd is looking into the exact scheme how this should work. What is clear is that the public keys (stratum server certificates) will have limited lifetime and thus will be cycled regularly. The miner should not even notice as the only thing that he would need to configure in his/her infrastructure is the pool authority public key that WILL not change on a long run. The software would take care of verifying its stratum endpoint public key upon every reconnect. (I copied this text as a comment: 
3. I see your point, the errors are currently an open topic and we will definitely consider your suggestion of having a machine readable error codes for basic/common error scenarios.
As of the reference implementation, we actually do provide one. Note, however, that is currently being update to reflect the latest protocol draft changes. The github repo URL is: 
Thanks for very valuable feedback!

thank you, we are based in Prague, so not really far from them ;-)

I don't have any opinion on Coinmine...
As of the solo mining vs. buying, well, if you don't care about the history of your coins (which you generally don't need to but some exchanges actually do...) you can buy the coins. If you do solo mining you get yourself virgin coins that haven't been touched by anybody.

As stated above, we would like to leave 3-5 months for comments/polishing the draft. The actually implementation/production ready will be another 6-12 months. At the same time,  there is already software to look into: [

To name one reason that we see - a lot of new hardware was being deployed in China where our presence is not at optimum.

One thing I forgot to add: overall efficiency: E.g. the protocol allows pools to distribute future block template ahead to its miners and then only send out a tiny '**SetNewPrevHash'** message to notify the miners to start working on a new block and flush everything. For those, who are familiar with stratum V1, this was not possible as the 'new block' flag was part of the full '**mining.notify'** message

We provide reference implementation in rust of the core protocol and also a simulator written in python. All this is currently being updated according to the latest spec. Everything open source  (including **Braiins OS**) is being published via this monorepo: [ There is **V2-&gt;V1** translating proxy, reference mining software (supporting block erupter and S9) called **bOSminer.** bOSMiner is intended to replace cgminer implementation eventually. The idea is to have this repository as the central go-to place for manufacturers to have look at actual implementation. **V1-&gt;V2** is yet to be implemented.
As of Matt continuing on BetterHash, I don't want to speak for him, my perception is that there is no motivation to continue on BetterHash.

There is no technical reason, we were being a bit conservative about our infrastructure settings. Thanks for heads up ;-)

Touching on the asic resistance topic in the talk... I am really not a big fan of non-asic solutions as they raise the bar to enter the game. Most ppl don't notice this fact thinking GPU's are off-the-shelf solution. Until somebody builds a system based on hybrid gpu's like the zcash miners etc.
