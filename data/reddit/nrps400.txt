He's talking about estimated tax payments. Check the IRS rules as there are safe harbors based on your tax liability in the prior year. 
To your general question, the gains are taxable for 2017 when the sale occurred, regardless of when you withdraw the cash. If you truly cannot get the cash out fast enough (and you should be able to by April 2018) then you'd face some IRS penalties and interest for late payment of taxes. 
You likely could work out a payment plan and mitigate some of that if you can demonstrate that you truly do not have access to the cash.

The top rate on long-term capital gains is 20%. The 3.8% applies if MAGI is above $200K.

You have mixed up a few things. Short term gains are held less than one year. That's subject to your marginal tax rate. If he has substantial gains and other income, it could be up to 39.6%. 
If the gain is long-term then it is taxed at 0, 15, or 20%, depending on his tax bracket.  
In addition to that, regardless of whether it is short or long term, he could face the 3.8% NIIT if he's single and MAGI is above $200k.

It has nothing to do with being a disciplined investor. It's entirely tax driven. 
If you have gains you want to sell at the beginning of the year, because the tax bill isn't due until April 2019. Also, since tax rates are dropping, all the more reason to sell in 2018. If you take gains in December 2017 the tax is due in April. No one is taking gains in 2017 unless they are a moron. 
If you have **losses** you want to sell at the end of the year, so that you can deduct it on the 2017 return. Anyone who bought in at $14K+ would have had an incentive to sell now.

No worries. Capital gain treatment has become very complicated with the various brackets and NIIT. It'll be more complicated in 2018 if tax reform passes, because the capital gain brackets are not staying aligned with the income tax brackets. 
Currently you hit 20% on long term capital gains when you hit the top tax bracket. But that will change.

There's no IRS guidance yet on BCH tax treatment. 
It would be reasonable to treat BCH as having zero basis (since BCH had zero value at the moment of the fork and prior to any trades) or allocate some basis from the original BTC (similar to a stock split) and then realize the gain only when selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:37:19
Their duty is to their clients, not the entire market. 
They know that announcing a new coin for trading will materially impact the price. Launching BCH is unique in that their customers already own BCH but could not access it. 
It would be irresponsible (possibly a fiduciary breach) for them to announce a market moving event and then not allow their customers to access their BCH. If the BCH price tanked, for example, because the market anticipated significant selling pressure, then customers would have suffered losses before ever getting access.

Not a popular opinion on this sub, but I am happy with how Coinbase has handled this whole situation. 
I invest in BTC because I want a small part of my total investment portfolio to be in cryptocurrency. It's a small part of my portfolio and the investment simply isn't large enough for me to spend time with hardware or paper wallets. I want a financial institution to hold my coins, and yes the private keys. Coinbase has been perfect for my use case. And Coinbase's reaction to BCC has made complete sense to me. I want stability, safety, and security. They've signaled that this is their priority to me loud and clear. 
In my view, the probability of Coinbase stealing my coins is a few orders of magnitude less likely than me screwing something up with my private keys, given my current level of sophistication. If BTC ever became a more substantial portion of my portfolio I would the invest time and money to get my coins off an exchange, but I'm nowhere near that level of exposure. 
My point is, there are a lot of BTC investors like me. We throw a few dollars onto a relatively easy interface like Coinbase, then buy and hold. If you want BTC to be valuable, you should want people like me and institutions like Coinbase! We help support the price, even if we don't embody all of the ideals of cryptocurrency.

I presume one of the reasons they are going slow is that they the are talking to regulators regarding whether crediting BCH will be a "security" for US securities law purposes.

The IRS only knows what Coinbase tells them, unless you self-report your trades. It's called information matching, similar to how W-2s work. 
Your employer sends you and the IRS a copy of your W-2. If you don't file a return that matches the W-2 the IRS has, then you get a letter asking what's up. 
For investment accounts there's something called a 1099, which the IRS also uses to match information on your tax return. If the numbers don't match, they will inquire further. Stock brokers like E-Trade have always sent 1099s based on your stock trades during the year. Coinbase and the IRS got into a dispute over whether Coinbase had an obligation to issue 1099s.

A share of stock is worth a share stock. A stock is also worth some amount of cash. 
If you sell bitcoin for cash, the value is the cash received. If you trade bitcoin for retail goods (say, a car), the value is car's cash price. If you trade bitcoin for another asset (say, gold), the value is the spot price at the time of the transaction. 
Fair market value has a well established and fairly obvious definition for tax purposes. It's the arms length price between willing and unrelated buyers and sellers. For highly liquid markets, like bitcoin, you use exchange prices.

You can have rules based monetary policy and QE. That's basically market monetarism. That term was created after Friedman's death, but his ideas form the basis for market monetarism. 
For Japan he advocated QE because they went from a steady rate of monetary growth to highly deflationary. QE was necessary to get back to the original trend rate. If they had set a monetary rule and followed it, QE wouldn't be necessary. 
He also happens to have the benefit of being right about QE. It works! Because QE (and contractionary monetary policy on the flip side) are so powerful, he advocated rules-based policy to avoid too much human intervention in monetary policy.

This is where you go off track. Your statement, as phrased, is obviously true. Fraudulently passing one thing off as another is obviously harmful. You've assumed the fraud and the harm! But in court you actually have to prove all of the elements of the claim. You don't get to just assume them. 
You have to prove harm, and hurt feelings don't count. You have to prove fraud, and the actual intentions of the other party matter, not your imagined intentions.

That's never happening. Coinbase will say what they've already said. "We will call Bitcoin whatever chain turns out to be what the rest of the market calls Bitcoin, based on a variety of factors. And before customers buy or sell Bitcoin, we'll include a message explaining out decision."
That kills the injunction. There's no likelihood of harm. The judge will tell you to come back later to show whether you've actually been harmed.

It's value is whatever buyers see in it. Likely because of the appreciation and *relatively* low transaction fees, it has become more of a store of value and a way to transfer large sums of money, rather than a currency useful for buying and selling goods. 
Gold has value in electronics but mostly it has value because buyers know it has value in the minds of others. 
As the volatility falls it may become more useful for actually buying things.

This claim is highly speculative. Fraud requires intentional deception. If I sell a thing with a label, it might be fraud if I intentionally mislabel that thing as something else to get you to buy it. But if a lot of customers view that thing under that particular label, then that label is accurate, even if a minority of the market disagrees. That's an amorphous concept, and particularly so with a new technology. Courts aren't going to step in and find fraud where what's actually going on is a market shakeout. 
Anyway, that's what Coinbase is getting after. They are saying, after the dust settles they will call Bitcoin what the "market" calls Bitcoin.
I'll also speculate that after the fork, if they ever label S2X as "Bitcoin", there will be an additional disclosure explaining what you are buying. Full disclosure defeats a fraud claim.

OP is just conspiratorial thinking. The more volatility there is an asset, the more traders think it is being "manipulated." But they are just coming up with reasons to explain the high volatility. We like to think ever big event is due to particular actors with evil intentions.

I think you've made the same mistake as the author. 
JPM never would have had loans on property it owns *because if you own the property you don't put a mortgage on it from yourself*. So there's nothing controversial or fraudulent about forgiving a loan on a property you don't own. The mortgage holder will never own the property, unless the borrower defaults and the lender takes possession. 
A mortgage is not ownership. It's a loan secured by the property. 
The author has basically parroted what they've read in a plantiffs brief but doesn't have the financial literacy to know what he's talking about.

This is one person at Goldman, a technical analyst, making predictions based on the chart.  Technical analysis is barely better than pseudoscience, but it is what it is.  
Goldman gives the information to its clients.  The clients decide to trade or not.  Goldman wants to make assets look appealing or unappealing in order to generate trades at the client level, which generates revenue for the bank.  Goldman doesn't really care whether it goes down, just whether clients are trading.  If you want to put a massive short bet on Bitcoin, Goldman will do your deal.  If you want to put a massive long bet on Bitcoin, they'll do that too.  
Additionally, cryptocurrency is a growing asset class, so Goldman wants clients to know that Goldman is paying attention to cryptocurrency.

They aren't "pocketing" BCC. They aren't recognizing it and have suggested here that people may get credited with it down the line if it has any value. But they have told customers if they want to be certain, to move their coins.

This is informal SEC guidance, not a court case. It'll also be highly fact dependent on whether one ICO is a security compared to another.

If you file tax return, the IRS generally has 3 years to challenge it (6 years if there is a "substantial underreporting" of income).
Suppose that it is unclear if you can apply a like kind exchange to an exchange of two cryptocurrencies. By filing the return taking that position, the IRS can either challenge it within 3 years, or let it go. 
But if you never file a return, or you don't file the correct documents, then the statute of limitations never starts.

It's not 100% clear scenario  is a like kind exchange, just because we have no specific IRS guidance on that type of exchange. But you don't have to be 100% certain to take a tax position, and I would say there is more than a reasonable basis.

That's not exactly the standard. The board of a corporation generally can't be sued if their decision was a reasonable application of their business judgment. 
Even if the decision "harms" shareholders (like selling more shares and diluting existing shareholders), a shareholder's recourse is to vote down the board or sell their shares. You can't sue the board unless the decision was totally out of the bounds of a reasonable business decision.

This doesn't make any sense. In a liquid efficient market, the price of one unit of an asset isn't going to impact price or volatility.
