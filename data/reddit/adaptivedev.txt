Yes, they responded here immediately in minutes, whereas in email no response after 2+ days.

UPDATE! I've gotten 12 of the BTC, now just waiting on 8 that was in vault, and 6 in other account vault from another $6k account.
** I would update the title to remove the word "took" to "held" but I can't, right? So I might delete this entire post after all is returned **

I actually created my account while I was in Israel, IIRC. Then, I started traveling, then, while in Ukraine, I tried to verify my US identity, and that's when it got closed. I guess there're enough confusing issues there. Fine. But I see this is a VERY common use-case, that should work better and have good customer support.

Actually, their CS support staff told me it IS a bug I pointed out to them. Please look at the screenshot and SEE that it says there's an error. Not being usable in Ukraine isn't a reason to hold my transfer out, and isn't the reason they're giving in 1 single support email they've responded with so far. And besides, they did also let me create an account from Ukraine. I had no idea I wasn't allowed to, and that's not even the issue here, so please read and understand the issue first addressed in my OP.

I have more info on the bug. Here's a screenshot:

When my $12,000 is returned, I'll changed the headline. For now, all I know is $12,000 was "taken" from me, as in my control of it was taken away, by combination of closed account + supposed bug + no support recourse. I'd like solutions, not verbal acrobatics.
I WARNED your CS staff several times, for 54+ hours, BEGGING them to respond.
I finally said, ok, I have to go to reddit.
I'll be happy when I get a follow up via support, to help me transfer the funds out. 
They continue to not respond. I'm setting up another wallet off of coinbase, and we'll see if I can transfer out.
Also, 6 BTC got "taken" from the other account you closed as it was in transit from the "vault" to my "wallet". I moved it to get off of coinbase. That 2nd account was closed while the transfer was in progress, and the 6 BTC is missing. I now gather I can't have 2 accounts. That is a separate issue, for which I'm sure the punishment shouldn't be taking my coins. I hope that "technical glitch" will be resolve as well. Otherwise, I'll have to post about that too.
I don't mean to be a pain, but when $12,000, and then another $3600 is "taken" from me, as in control of it was taken from me, I want technical help, not philosophy. I like CoinBase otherwise, and will be happy when the problem is resolved, and wish you all the best.

Thanks John! Can you please just send the coins to the other wallet address? I sent the address in the support emails. Can you respond to the email, perhaps with phone/skype contact? Thanks!

Which countries have them working well? What are the limits and %?
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:29:08
I didn't realize how important it is to control your own coins. Now I do.
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:28:46
You're right, and I've learned my lesson.
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:30:18
I don't understand your suggestion. I'm new also, but I don't think I've direct access to the wallet if it's in their site.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:02:08
I made 2 by accident (I had an old one I forgot about) and then I just kept both. I didn't even know that's a problem, and that's irrelevant. The penalty for 2 accounts is perhaps closing down the accounts, which is fine, but the penalty is not keeping my coins. They're not even saying that's the penalty, so there no reason you "need a good answer here" to understand the crux of the issue. Your question, therefor, is a distraction from the issue.
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:27:06
I didn't even know 2 accounts is a problem. I don't care to do business with them now. I just want to transfer the coins they promised to send, and can't, because of their tech "bug" they admitted to in email, and thanked me for pointing out. I setup another wallet to transfer to, and am waiting for bug is fixed, or for them to send to another wallet manually.

More trouble! I had another coinbase account from which I wanted to move coins away from coinbase because of this problem.
This other account just got closed, which is fine. 
BUT, I had 7.6 btc in the vault, with 6 btc being transferred from vault to my btc wallet (so that I can move off of coinbase).
Now, I see only 1.6 btc in the vault, and this amount is MISSING from the total. I really hope these btc won't disappear in the process!
