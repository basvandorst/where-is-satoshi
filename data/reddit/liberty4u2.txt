bullshit.  Why is it that every socialized medicine country has a private medicine tier?  I'll tell you why, if you want anything significant done in a reasonable time then you pay.  Why is it that a large % of europeans want to get higher education in the US?  I'll tell you why.  The education is far superior.  The professor promotion system in europe is still stuck in the 17th century, not merit based.
Yes US medicine and education costs a lot but look at what it brings the entire world.  Most tech and medical break throughs come from the US.  There is a reason for that and it is not called socialism.  Sorry for the rant.

This is similar to my thinking.  However I think there will be a transition to USD euro, etc being "backed" by BTC  (or other supplant)  My fear is that governments will just issue their own digital currency and make BTC illegal.  Btw I don't think that will work as BTC will continue but I can see "raids" to shut down miners or nodes.  You know, to save the children or stop terrorists.

I am a busy professional that enjoys working.  I really believe that bitcoin will be worth &gt;100k each someday.  Prior to my investment in BTC I was already multi-millionaire.  BTC just made possible to retire very easy.  I just like doing things the hard way.  I don't expect people to believe me.  That's fine.  Life is not about ease it is about what you do with what you are given.  I feel that I have been given a lot and consequently think I should give a lot back.  So I make businesses and employ people and pay them well.  I get great satisfaction from this.  Much more than sitting on a beach somewhere everyday.

I use EFT to buy bitcoin often.  I've found Coinbase to be excellent for this purpose.  You set up your account at coinbase.  Buy the amount of BTC you want (the money is taken via EFT from your associated bank account) and BTC shows up in your account balance on Coinbase after several days.  I then transfer the BTC to my wallet.  That simple.   
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:37:06

I may be dumb.  But I have used coinbase for about a year with one transaction a month.  I noticed nothing different during the purchase.  I did not see a big warning message.  I have never seen a warning message.  I just get a confirm window that I have to do 2FA in.  That's it.  This purchase was no different than any other and if you look at the email they sent me you can see that they thought I purchased 5 BTC.  No warning.

I think everyone should email.  Btw here is the list of payment types they accept (one more wouldn't hurt would it? ;-)
We accept credit cards, debit cards, payment from U.S. checking accounts, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Payments Stored Balance, and the Amazon.com Store Card. Here are the credit cards we accept:

I love this.  I didn't read the entire thing but I want to share an anecdote.  My first BTC were purchased via a wire transfer from WF to Gox about a year ago.  I sat in WF for over 45 minutes filling out paperwork and paid a $35 fee to get the funds to Gox.  I was inpatient I will admit.  The bank employee asked me why I was buying BTC and I responded the I could not stand how inefficient and expensive banks are and I want to help change the situation.  All I got was a blank stare...   Now I can send money anywhere within seconds and virtually free.  Love BTC.

@_date: 2014-10-21 19:46:37
Why did they send me an email saying that I had purchased 5 BTC then?  This is crap.  They are expanding into 19 countries but they can't keep the market value straight?   If the market value drops will I get more BTC then I purchase, NO I highly doubt that.  This is a "bank error in their favor" situation.  Which is not good.  I'm a millionaire  I don't really care about a few hundred dollars in BTC.  It's the principle.  They should make the right.

@_date: 2015-01-09 14:25:24
I did very simple calculations and estimated that if BTC captured 1% of global cash flow per year.  It's value should be about $54,000 USD.  I figure that even if governments make it illegal (and I am sure they will) they can't shut down the internet.

I was recently put on a jury after stating that I would exercise jury nullification if the case warranted it.  I could not believe they let me on.  Anyway mistrial.  More people need to know what JN is and need to exercise it so us Ron Paul people can have wet UNdreams.

I've been with USAA since 1984.  They are the best national brand I have ever worked with.  They are very forward thinking.  They know about BTC.  Interesting side note.  When I tried to purchase BTC from a USAA account 2 years ago they would not let me wire funds to one of the european btc exchanges (I can't remember which).  I told them that I was a long term member and I want my money wired.  They refused.  I said that I was contacting a lawyer and they moved me up to a supervisor who "allowed" the transfer.  They've learned much in the past two years.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:26:38
Interestingly, about 1.5 to 2 years ago they wouldn't allow me to wire money to one of the european or MtGox exchanges (I can't remember).  I was pissed at the time.  However, I've been with them for many years and overall really like them.  Especially now.

It was partially in jest.   If you are a free market capitalist, such as myself, NOTHING should be incentivezed.  This only distorts the market and leads to big bubbles which are harmful to people and business.   If you believe in central planning then I understand your point but it does not maximized the economy and harms individuals.

I will use the hell out of it.  I think most laws are immoral.  The government has no right to tell you what to do if you are not harming others.  Put me on a jury and I will be the hold out.  I will convince others.  I do not smoke the stuff but I will NEVER convict someone for possession if I'm on a jury.  The states attorney asked if we could "follow the letter of the law".  I said I would not if I thought the law was wrong and explained that I understood jury nullification and would use it if it applied to the circumstances. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:52:07
Hardly but not impossible. Why someone would accept a bitcoin credit note? The bitcoin networks wouldn't recognise this as legitimate.
I have been putting bitcoin clauses in my contracts when I loan money.  Kinda like old "gold" clauses that are now illegal.   My first note people questioned me about it and I told them what bitcoin was and they said fine.   3 other notes with the clause with no questions.  I can switch to bitcoin repayment any time and will do so if hyperinflation occurs.

Without it there would be very few wars and grand giveaway programs (Social Security/medicare).  I believe that BTC will make the free printing of money difficult.  They don't want competition.   They will try and ban it somehow.

It is unreasonable I agree, but so is the endless printing of money.

In this situation I think people will not trust banks or governments at all.  They will be forced to move to physical assets.  These are hard to move long distances for commerce.  Al this will push BTC to astronomical heights.  Unlikely to all happen but plausible.  See you at the yacht club.
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:12:59
Just a warning to all in the BTC/old world banking system.  $10k USD is a problem for banks/old school financial systems.  They are required to report these transactions to the government (you know terrorists/drug dealers etc).  You should stay away from that number.  do two 5k transactions separated by a few days/week

I remember wiring $3000 to some bank in Japan (Mt Gox) and my local banker telling me that it was a scam.  She literally pleaded with me not to send the money.  The branch manager got involved and I told him I would leave the bank (empty my accounts) if they didn't follow my instructions.  It took about 1 hour of time and cost me a $65 (fee).  I knew that day that BTC would win.  Now if I want $3000 sent somewhere in the world I just do it with BTC.  No branch manager/teller telling me what to do with my money.  The transfer is nearly instant and cost very little.  The old banking system is already at the gallows.  The noose is bing put around it's neck.  When the next world financial crisis occurs and the banking "money system" freezes up, bitcoin will explode.

I always viewed BTC as a risky proposition and as such have become quite wealthy from it.  But I have also made lots of money with other risky ventures.  I have a rule of thumb for gains from risky investments.  If the gains can SIGNIFICANTLY change your life then cash out and do it.  By signficantly, I mean, pay off student debt/other debt completely, pay off mortgage, make it so you don't have to work anymore.  This makes it much easier for me to make decisions with such gains.  It's worked for me.  I only have one more to unlock (retire with 12k/month passive income)

I didn't know that Gavin told satoshi that he was going to speak to the CIA right before satoshi went incommunicado.   This supports my hypothesis that this is a creation of the CIA.

Actually I think it has everything to do with bitcoin but not in the way many people think it does.  Look at that last number.  Just look at it.  Those are USD "assets".  $553 T. yes that is a T.  I'm actually surprised someone put an actual number on it.  That is a number that doesn't even make sense.  This is the exact same kinda of banking fiasco that lead to the Great depression.  When the derivatives market goes boom, I believe that BTC will rule the day.  People will no longer trust banks and the governments that support them.

It's called a market.  In my opinion it is one of the most free in the world.

As an example I have bought most of my btc for a price of around $200 and it is money that I don't need.  Im not interested in selling until btc &gt;10,000 USD because that is a price that selling will significantly change my life.  Others (day traders) may be excited by a $1 shift in the BTC/USD price.

Thanks for a wonderfully written response.  I have not listened to the debate yet.  
"In fact, this network is probably one of the most valuable and consequential technologies currently on the planet. Some of us realized this a few years ago. Others are realizing it now. Many more will realize it in the future. The Bitcoin network is, fundamentally, a ledger of title controlled by no man. Ponder that for a moment. The transmission of value and ownership has thus just been severed from the State, not by impotent voting, but by the technological achievement of man."
The quote above is what I realized the minute I understood BTC about 5 months ago.  True freedom/liberty is derived from property rights (including stores of value, money)  What is economic freedom worth??  To some of us a lot.  To most economic freedom doesn't mean much as the majority are slaves to debt.  Ask the Cypriots what they think about economic freedom?
Thanks again.

I think the BTC will be wildly successful for two simple reasons:
NOT controlled by robber politicians/centralized bankers
Robber politicians/centralized bankers via the IRS cannot seize them.
If you live in the USA everything you own is because the IRS lets you own it.  If they think you owe them money they can seize everything (house, vehicles, bank accounts, etc).  Not BTC.  Its wonderful financial freedom.  And they will try and shut it down.

Can't wait to buy more.  I wish I could get USD more easily to the exchange.  Here is a reply to why I think BTC will eventually be worth at least 5kUSD
I am a wealthy (millionaire, not ultra-wealthy) individual who is highly educated (not in finance). My money is self made and I have had to learn a lot to make my money grow for me. Here is my very simple reasoning for btc &gt;5k usd.
This is the worlds first recognized global currency that has several EXTREMELY good things going for it. Anonymity, easily transferred, NOT centrally controlled, and especially there is a maximum number of btc that will be "minted". This last point is something that no other fiat currency has and is very important as every large government in the world has there money printing presses working overtime causing devaluation of their currency. This currency will only devalue some as the rest of btc are mined. I think everyone will want this type of currency to protect themselves from their governments stealing by devaluing their currency or direct confiscation (see cyprus). This means the poor people in Zimbabwe what it and billionaires from Russia want it and Doctors in America want it.
Well what is that worth? Well the market cap right now is about 1.5 to 2 billion USD. That is NOTHING in the global economy. So lets pick out a market that is more reasonable for a global currency (the first of its kind). How about a trillion USD market cap, I think that is reasonable I don't know for sure it could be 10 trillion (not impossible). Nevertheless, 1 trillion divided by 20,000,000 btc is $50,0000USD per btc. Well why don't I predict that number? Because I think BTC success will result in other digital currencies being developed and competing with BTC. I cannot reasonably see &gt;10 new digital currencies working so the number will be probably lower than that. $50,000USD/10 new world currencies equals 5k USD/BTC.
Now the big unknown is the world governments. This will be the test. They have to shut this down or they can't pay for weapons and social programs. OR they will embrace the currency and tax it extremely high estimating &gt;50% for each transaction. How can that occur? It can't the currency is encrypted and anonymous. They may try doing it at the exchanges but the exchanges will become less and less valuable as BTC is accepted by vendors. So they will do it at the vendors of goods. So it will be fun seeing how the governments will try and shut this down. Probably it's "funding Terrorists" but that's getting to old. We will see.
Just simple calculations but I think quite accurate. I welcome feedback as reddit is so good at giving.

Good advice.  Even though this looks like a bubble I believe that it is different.  This is a first (as far as I can tell) time that there is a world currency that isn't controlled by a central authority.  Imagine! Incredible!  Currency has been manipulated by authority to the detriment of the people for thousands of years.  With Bitcoin we are free.  This economic freedom is extremely powerful and something the poorest person in a dictator run African country will want (see the 100 Trillion dollar bill from Zimbabwe) to the Richest Russian trying to hide funds from its government.  The bitcoin will have ups and downs but I believe that it will ultimately serve as a highly valued (who know how high I think in the range of $5000 to 10,000USD per BTC) form of money.  
I have no doubt that it will drop seriously especially with the Governments try and shut it down but in the end I think that will serve to strengthen the BTC.   I'm in for the long haul but I agree be careful.  You should never have all your fruit in one basket.

I don't think you understand the power to print fiat.  They will outlaw BTC, they have to.  Everything the government does depends on the ability to print money out of thin air.  However, I don't think a law against BTC will make one bit of difference BTC will continue as it represents Worldwide economic freedom.

Not so.  The stock holder in the modern stock market is the last person to be rewarded for a businesses success.  Profits go to increased pay for executives/ pay loans/pay bond holders/ employee bonuses etc.  The last person to benefit is the stock holder.  I know there are exceptions but I do just fine outside the stock market.

I think you are economically illiterate or have really drunk the cool-aid.  The fed has continuously destroyed the dollar.  They are admitting to $85 billion/month in "QE"="printing money (on the books)".  That is what they are admitting to,  I believe the number is much higher but we can't audit the Fed because we live in a free* society /s.  Simple math  $85,000,000,000/317,000,000(population of US)=$268 per month per person in the USA.  Average house hold is 4 people.  That's $1,072/month per house hold being created out of thin air.  Average US income is $4300 per month.  Explain to me how "creating" 1/4 of an average households earning in dollars is not going to destroy the USD.   This excess money has largely be absorbed into "financial instruments" but it will eventually leak out in to the real world and cause hyperinflation in the USD.  This will happen when the next "financial crisis" occurs and it will be very bad for those not prepared "food and guns" and what not.  "They won't come for us"
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:51:52
Every time a european "state" gets in trouble.  Everytime the Fed announces QE^8onitsside.  Everytime war is threatened the bitcoin will rise.  It is the most certain economic thing I know.  A trillion USD/bitcoin market for the entire world seems very realistic to me in the not to distant future.  I see only upside.
If the governments try and shut it down it will become even more popular.  I do think there will be competing digital currencies.  This will be great and will limit BC some.  This will be fun to watch.

Great comparing one fiat being destroyed to another fiat being destroyed.  The government repays it's debts by creating more debt.  You know, paying one credit card off with another.  That works great for awhile especially when you are the reserve currency of the world but eventually no one is interested in buying your paper debt.  We as seeing the beginnings of that as government bonds are not being all purchased in the private market.  The house of cards will come down.  It's a big house.  We will all be hurt.

This will come to the EU and USA to.  As the debt mounts, the printing press will work overtime and devaluation of the currency will force the governments to take similar actions.  It never works.  The currencies must fail.  BTC will rise.

The email responses are not good.  They indicate as taniquetil stated above that there is some kind of financial shenanigans going on or worse.  I believe the worst case is the federal government blocking wire transfers in usd to US banks.  However I think that will eventually increase the value of BC as those in existence will be harder to get for those of us that currently use that outdated fiat paper stuff.

For the hardcore anti-fiat money gold person.  Remember in the USA it was illegal to own gold at one time.  They can confiscate it if they really want it.  Also it is still illegal to put a gold clause in a US contract despite what the constitution says.  Bitcoin?  Glad you asked.  Last I heard the Dread Pirate Roberts (the first) has all his drug money and there isn't anything the government can do about that.  Also it has increased in value considerably since his incarceration.

I think 100,000 is very reasonable.  Think about this.
This is the first truly global currency.
This is the first widely distributed currency NOT to be controlled by a government.  
There is near total economic freedom with BTC.
The USD is being destroyed daily by the Feds printing press.
Note: don't think for a second that the US government will not try and shut BTC down.  It will.  It has to.  The printing press is the governments ultimate control tool.  They will not lose it without a fight.
