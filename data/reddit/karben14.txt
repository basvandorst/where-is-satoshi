Yes. I agree. So many have this abstract idea about Bitcoin that is so inaccurate. 
Bitcoin is limited in number. Bitcoin if successful and I say if, will eventually need to be worth a few trillion or more if it will handle a percentage of the worlds monetary needs.
Bitcoin is a form of money, like the USD. If it succeeds it will one day be valued in the hundreds of thousands or even millions per Bitcoin.

It doesn't matter how you divide it up if the amount of divisions are a finite number. 
How about I say that the total amount of Satoshis will be worth Trillions?  Satoshis are a subset of Bitcoins.  Therefore the 21, 000,000 Bitcoins will be worth Trillions some day.

21, 000, 000 Bitcoins. End of mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:55:33
So that still means a finite amount of Bitcoins.  That's my point. And they will have a certain value one day, fluctuating with the market like the USD does.  Their value will be in the trillions.

Sure what you said is true, but whatever we call mining and who gets paid the end result is the same. And that is what this discussion is about. The finite nature of Bitcoins. 21 million.
This means it has inherent value due to its desirability and it's rarity.
The rarity is what I am talking about.

Great idea. Start a business based on using Bitcoin as your currency. Best business model you could have. What you sell is irrelevant as long as Bitcoin is your foundation.

Mining is not ordering transactions. This is basic. Mining refers to the creation of "the" Bitcoins, the 21 million. 
Where you got the idea that transactions are mining is just wrong. Do some Googling.

Why do you bring up Satoshi units? There is only "one" Bitcoin. It consists of 21,000,000 units.
It is divided into many entities. 
One day Bitcoin will be worth trillions as a whole (the 21 million units). 
Each Satoshi will be worth a percentage of those trillions. Each type of Bitcoin such as Litecoin will be worth a percentage of those trillions.

This is a speculation I am making.
I  am assuming that in the future Bitcoin becomes the money standard. 
I am assuming that the 21 million bitcoins need to  handle our world currency needs. 
So I am thinking that one bitcoin needs to have an ever increasing value equal to 1/21,000,000th of the total value of world currency needs.
Using current figures of about 30 trillion in USD dollars is where I get my speculative value of 1.4 million dollars per bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:04:27
I know it  is divisible by 0.000001 or so but I am talking about a total valuation of the 21 million bitcoins that will exist. 
I am assuming in my speculation that bitcoin becomes the world standard currency.

No one can tell you because Bitcoin is not like other investments. It is vaporware and there is no way to measure nothing. Can you check the companies financials?

Can you just read what I wrote instead of just reacting? No one said it's going below it's current price. Going to cash and waiting is a safety strategy to save a person from POSSIBLE greater losses. If it doesn't drop anymore then you re-buy on the upswing.

Interesting comment. But I have a question. What exactly is there to research in regards to Bitcoin? It is vaporware, there is nothing to research. I have some stock in ABT Abbott Laboratories. I can and did research on them, their technology, financials, directors, product, history, etc etc. There is a lot of real people, 75,000 of them at ABT doing real things, that is how you do research.

It doesn't assume anything. It just puts your money in a safe spot while the market readjusts. If it doesn't continue to fall it still works. You simply re-buy. But If it does continue to fall your money is safe and waiting for you. If it rises you re-buy and wait for profits.

You have choices. You bought at 10. Now its at 5 and still dropping. 
You can hold and if it continues to drop, you are in an even worse spot. 
You can sell now and if it continues to drop you can re-buy later and get more coins than you had before. 
You can sell now at a loss and if it immediately goes back up you re-buy. 
You can hold and if it goes back up great.

"Just dollar cost average your way down then. Buy at 8500. 7500. 6500."
I know what dollar cost averaging is. Why would anyone buy at 8500, 7500, and 6500 to average down? Do all your buying at 6500 and you come out way farther ahead. Anyone who dollar cost averages 3, 4 or even more times is doing it wrong. That's not how it works.
What if you sold all you had for cash, held your money till a solid bottom appeared (let's say 4000) and the direction reversed and Bitcoin started going steadily up? Wouldn't that create the best profits?

This is a standard investing strategy, but real investors don't wait for a 50% drop to sell, they put in automatic sell orders to sell when the price dips below a level that makes the investment uncertain.

The best strategy when investing is to have automatic stop losses in place so you can protect your money even if it means a small loss. When you see red that is the signal to sell, hold cash, and re-buy when the price has dropped and is going back up.
The hodl philosophy goes against this very basic investment strategy. I wish uninformed investors here would STFU about this hodl philosophy.

Wow! Encouraging Bitcoin investors who have almost zero investing skill to invest in Futures. Good advice! Well done, almost as wise as the hodl philosophy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:55:03
So you lost more than you gained, you knew nothing and you got wrecked. Your website had a bad business model. In the end the only thing that gained was the amount of Bitcoin you hold, but you could have tripled your bank account instead. Do you have something your trying to teach?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:24:07
A stop loss is a personal choice. Unfortunately Bitcoin is not well suited to stop losses. Learn to invest in real stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:05:52
Do they let you out without an attendant?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:00:52
Funny. Tragic too. So many going to lose all with the stupid hodl philosophy. Buy and hold is considered a legitimate strategy if you are buying healthy strong BLUE CHIP companies. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:16:34
The Bitcoin hodlers are the ones who bought high and now are being forced low. I don't invest like that. I use stop losses and buy quality companies.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:40:40
You say if you can predict Bitcoin price changes...why even say that? Can you predict it. 
I could say if I could just figure out where the biggest gold nugget is buried I would be rich, but saying that doesn't make it true.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:26:27
Your arguments are ridiculous, are you just trolling?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:42:52
None of what I said applies to true believers, who happen to be a small minority. Just like Christians, the distant hope of a future in heaven allows them to not care about this life we have on Earth now.

Buy tech stocks in good companies like ABT, NTLA, SGMO and medical stocks and a bluechip stocks and diversify. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:30:48
Why hold onto your cash and buy the dip at the bottom? Do the math and you will see.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:42:30
Your not even talking about the same thing. Good grief.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:16:25
Where do you get those numbers from? 27K? 5 years? Like everyone else here with numbers, your simply making it up. Foolish to dupe newbie investors into doing something unwise with their money.
Hold onto your money, it only loses 1.5 percent a year if you do nothing with it. Invest it wisely and you can be wealthy some day. If you really want to buy Bitcoin, then just wait wait wait! Why does everyone here encourage others to buy a dropping commodity?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:40:38
Kill me now. LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:17:25
Say you bought ONE (so you own one BTC) at 17,000 for ease of the math and then the price starts dropping. So you finally decide at 10,000 to sell it. Now you own ZERO BTC and have 10,000 cash. So it keeps dropping and goes to 8000, then 7000, then 5000, where it stops, and the market hits the bottom. You see this and decide to buy in again at 5000. Now you have two BTC. Do you see what happened here?

In your example with Coke, you need to realize something. Coca Cola is a huge multinational company with a diverse market and product line holding billions in real assets and billions in yearly sales of a very popular product. It isn't going to crash anytime soon. Matter of fact millions have invested part of their life savings into it because it is a blue chip investment.

Why not have a government of the people that we can all respect, or does OP prefer war and conflict?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:42:53
He got rich because he is smart. Unlike you.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:37:26
Why didn't you re-buy when it started going up? Or did it go up to 17 in a few seconds? Who says it's going to 17? This strategy is not intended for people who let their investments drop 50% because someone told them to hold. It works best when used at the right time.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:24:41
I still got ALL of my dollars in my pocket.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:40:50
Why so eager to get in bed with your bank? And your desperate to borrow valuable fiat to buy useless BTC? Such hypocrites in the BTC community.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:54:49
You are ridiculous. I don't care what you say money is worth, money is valuable and I know it, so do you. All you have is because of money. Suck t up.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:44:51
And what? What would you like to ask?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:38:49
I am simply trying to show how to minimize damage, not how to predict the market or maximize profits. Go ahead hold. If you it works for you, great. Most Bitcoin owners are not the long term visionaries who believe in the Satoshi dream. The large majority are newbie investors hoping to make money. They are getting fleeced.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:35:57
With conventional stocks you can study the numbers which is called the technicals, and you can study fundamentals which refers to outside factors affecting price like the weather for instance.
Bitcoin doesn't work like that. The technicals mean very little and have no use in predicting price movement. As regards fundamentals there is only a few, greed, fear, faith, hope and stupid philosophies like hodl.
What can you do with that info?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:49:39
If the trend is clearly going up and you still like the investment, then you re-buy with your cash. I would rather lose $100 and then wipe the dust off myself and try again on a gaining market, than to keep holding and lose thousands in a market that never seems to hit bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:30:17
I have been following his success for 45 years since I was a boy and his philosophy is to buy quality companies, make them even better and hold onto them. Bitcoin does not meet that criteria. Matter of fact, Bitcoin isn't a company or an asset or anything, it is just a belief.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:57:05
Isn't that like 50 dollars? Is that expensive for a few grams of chicken feed? What am I getting wrong here?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:53:33
Finally a wise investor here. Feel free to take profits from the hodlers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:54:45
You believe that? That is very naive. Is that an excuse to use foolish investment strategies?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:13:07
Well index funds have a lot of decades of investment experience behind them. Buying and holding may be simple and easy to do for crypto but that doesn't make it wise.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:20:29
Wow! Bitcoin is sure outperforming the Dow and S&amp;P 500. Amazing, sure glad I got in at $19,000.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:10:00
I heard that one about a dart throw being better than the pros. That is why I self manage my money. I am doing well. Bitcoin is like a pyramid scheme, you constantly need new people to pay out the ones on top selling out. That's exactly what is happening and so many are blinding following this buy buy buy and hodl religion, with millions cheering them on.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:18:46
So the SEC sees a need to regulate Bitcoin and you see this as a bullish signal? Whatever helps you to hold I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:52:07
The ideal is after selling at a loss, your stock continues to go down proving you made the right decision to sell, and when it is really low and at the bottom which can be seen by a strong market reversal you buy double or triple of the stock you had before.
