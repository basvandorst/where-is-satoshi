It could be a very long time before you see prices near the highs again. The hysteria is gone. People (both retail and institutional) are realizing that they won't necessarily "miss out" if they don't bet the house right now. Beyond that, the more "professional" investors / gamers are realizing that they are more likely to reap those crazy returns on other cryptocurrencies that are less known to the outside world. And finally, Bitcoin is not the only thing you can invest in that will make you money, which I think some people here forget sometimes.

Gold isn't conscious.

Can't deal with trade volumes that have never existed in the history of digital currency?
I'm sure there are tons of other exchanges out there that have the capacity to deal with an unprecedented situation. /s

Cool story bro.

Don't forget these:
-Takes a massive amount of electricity to produce new coins
-Diverts money away from socially productive investments

Bitcoin isn't currency.

Let's stop investing in things that will better life for ourselves and others and move it all into Bitcoin. That'll really help the economy.

At age 15 you shouldn't be fucking around with the riskiest investment in modern history.

The speed of adoption is unprecedented because of today's technology. Imagine the gold rush if everyone just had to log onto their phones instead of travelling across the country on horse back.
I use gold as an example because that's also something that is essentially completely useless and just used as a store of value, which now that centuries have past since the initial burst, moves up and down at a snails pace as all stores of value should.

Because this whole thing is a sham.
I've never used Bitcoin to buy anything except drugs online.
The people who have been buying bitcoin in droves recently have probably never used it to buy anything.

What game do you mean? I don't fully understand what you're alluding to when you say "this game we're playing with bitcoin right now".
I wouldn't recommend that people start taking on loans / putting all their savings into Bitcoin right now. Let's not forget the mortgage crises that triggered a global recession (not that this is anywhere close to that yet). People were taking out mortgages like crazy, the whole market was built on nothing, so once the dominoes started falling it created a collapse that took five years for the DOW (to just used that as an example) to get back to the level that it was at. And honestly, there HASN'T been as big of a recovery as you might think for the vast majority of people. The rich have gotten richer, wages aren't keep up with capital gains AT ALL. Our society is probably worse off than it was 10 years age in terms of inequality and the vast amount of problems that have developed as people got knocked down and couldn't quite ever get back up.
