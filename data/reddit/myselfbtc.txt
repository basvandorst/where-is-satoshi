i u have any questions u can use this thread some sort of ama 
   
@_date: 2012-12-27 20:23:53
1)  if you don't mind i will make some copy paste 












you mean using leverage or using the simple exchange ?
             
3) 
you are exaggerating for example in the '90 there was no ajax, the other point is rows and columns are the best way to show data (remember the accounting spreadsheets evolved into excel) the site can look better that for sure but so far it serve the purpose to display data, after the platform get most of features implemented does make sense to improve the looks 
@_date: 2012-12-27 20:55:13
I assume you talk about this   
 * depositors post offers using this page    
 * depositors put the conditions for the credits; interest, amount, time and auto renew  
 * when margin-traders take this credits the pages get updated and show the average interest based on the total credits used by margin-traders  
 * bitfinex.com don't set the interest is all market based  
 * bitfinex.com does have a fee for this, see loans   
this formatting is a pain 
@_date: 2012-12-27 13:46:47
u are wrong, you should update your information before posting

nice try troll with that old copy paste, try harder and never stop we need you 
@_date: 2012-12-28 19:39:34
1) available amount that other users offer, bitfinex don't lend you money
  
2) your limit is set by the tradable balance, you can take loans until this balance goes down to 0, the size is set by your trading wallet value and available credit   
example  
+ you get on your trading wallet 1000 USD  
+ with 5 leverage (max) you can buy bitcoins for almost 5000USD (about 370 BTC at current price)  
+ if there is available on credit book only 100 then you can buy only 100  
 
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:12:30
side note, mtgox does run its own liquidity bot, so if any of you make a bot and your bot cant put and remove orders at same speed like this bot (order book delayed, pending ordets etc) this can be a mtgox bot

bitfinex dont work that way   
* users position dont cancel each other all order go live so if one sell 1000 and the next user buy 2000 the bid goes down 1000 and the ask goes down by 2000  
* like i said before leverage users borrow money, they work with borrowed money so even if you deposit 10000 BTC and the total lending offer is 100 then you only can short 100   
* trader deposit are to back its position not to trade with that money  
* max leverage is 5 not 10   
* bitfinex.com have some pages that you need to read before posting crap,  a short example

*plz understand that my English is poor*


this still stands, your scenario is correct, traders take a loan and try to make money with said loan, if they make money they keep the profits pay the interest and return the loan if they dont make a profit they pay the interest from their wallet and take de loss 


  
with leverage you buy x5 your wallet value so if you have 1 btc you can buy almost 5 BTC and if you have 14,50 USD you can sell almost 5 BTC and if you have 10 BTC and you want to buy bitcoin there is no point of selling the 10 bitcoin to get usd and buy again you just keep them
