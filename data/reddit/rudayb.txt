Thank you for that answer
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:53:06
You're seriously amazing. Thank you
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:10:46
WHY NOT BOTH TOGETHER?
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:23:01
Thank you, that's really helpful.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:06:10
Do you have a link to the papers?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:59:16
So what price would you say is sustainable? Where it is now? 300? How can we tell?
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:13:04
Yea i'll look into that.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:04:52
Somebody just did 
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:21:13
How often do you play the game? I only get tipped every 20 minutes. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:58:58
accurate gif
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:18:54
You could find an atm or pay someone in the US
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:44:19
The iPhone iron.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:05:41
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:11:03
Thank you good sir!
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:16:54
I wish I had that much Bitcoin in my possession. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:00:25
Thank you for all the help. Out of all the exchanges, which do you like the most?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:09:19
Bitcoin is so fascinating. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:25:06
I am from Gonzaga University and would love to take you up on a Bitcoin atm. Who should I get in contact with?
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:00:09
I have less bitcoins than the cost of a Trezor
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:44:36
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:04:28
Hopefully its just server issues, not a hacking. *biting nails*
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:18:14
Some of them still are!
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:14:44
Hi there
@_date: 2015-01-11 07:18:17
This is so incredibly helpful
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:03:17
Any idea what it could be?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:17:42
Yea they do have that Bitcoin vibe
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:20:47
Thank you. That has been incredibly helpful. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:08:13
Absolutely. I would love to do photos for a fellow redditor. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:42:38
I ordered one and I will let you know what it is like
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:07:25
I think it would be interesting if it was bitstamp releasing as much Bitcoin as they could so that they could drive the price down. Then buy it up cheaper to make up for losses. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:22:32
Who else does this?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:17:24
What would it take from our community to push into the mainsteam so that local restaurants would recognize it?
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:02:15
It takes so long to verify transactions, companies would have to put so much trust into the buyer
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:23:10
If only they would just force everyone to watch that. Just put it on the 5pm news and you could have half the country interested
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:58:30
So essentially to make a transaction you have to put in a code. What about recovering a wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:03:38
So Bitcoin is not anonymous such that everyone can see the transactions being made and how much you have. However they can't see who you are?
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:54:23
is what down?
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:34:11
Good call I'll change that up. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:34:32
I appreciate you checking it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:54:10
Yup its on purpose. Some people like it, some don't
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:53:22
Yup. Share the wealth
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:59:45
If they quit mining wont is also take longer for us to get to the next difficulty?
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:45:40
Can't Coinbase vault get hacked just like everything else?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:25:55
Yea it would be cool if it was on PS4 and such. I really don't know how to get my friends interested. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:56:50
I'll go ahead and add that info
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:05:27
It's seriously that easy?
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:10:15
Thank you! I'm on my way to Monterey so there will likely be some new ones later tonight. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:41:27
What would an easier way be? just putting my address down?
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:05:26
What other companies like bitpay share all the info?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:56:16
Would the problem be perennial? If difficulty goes down then more miners come back, then we would have to raise difficulty. I feel like this is just cyclical and will forever be unstable. Where would the equilibrium in the market be?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:10:46
What would you say is the main thing driving the price? 
The amount of bitcoins on the market is ultimately what controls it, right? Therefore negative feedback due to current prices is causing it to tumble downward
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:33:51
I just started noticing that as well. I should look at the code. I think it's an error on Coinbase's side 
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:05:41
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:12:12
It hit me the other day, I realized as long as I enjoy my work that's all that matters. If others like it too, well then that's a cherry on top. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:25:36
Thanks for giving me the idea for my new app
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:49:52
For Bitcoin to get popular it's going to take a big company to start accepting it. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:18:07
Making it more widely accepted
@_date: 2016-01-09 00:23:00
No you can use it there. You just can't live in Michigan and order one to your house. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:35:18
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:02:47
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:46:24
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:04:09
Does it have Touch ID on iOS?
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:23:30
Use iVPN, it is located outside of the US and the speeds are as good as PIA. Also has port forwarding if you need it
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:36:26
Like a 10% off if you use bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:36:11
I know they currently don't have a reason to, I am just trying to bring others to use it which could help in the long term.
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:55:35
So now that you can use Coinbase or circle... Where should someone with a U.S. Bank account go to buy btc
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:29:51
Simple enough and worked. Thanks, have 400 bits on me @_date: 2015-02-21 17:58:16
Now this makes sense. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:21:44
This may be a super dumb question but how do you store it and why is it unsafe?
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:06:37
This just helped me so damn much. Here's 1000 bits on me @_date: 2015-02-23 08:32:17
How did you set up Bitcoin payments on etsy?
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:32:46
I run a photography business out of Spokane Washington. Http://rudybermudez.co
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:02:22
I know electrum has more features, I just wish they would get the UI of hive.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:42:55
That's a great idea. The way the market is going right now I could make that money back easily, or lose even more. Either way I like the idea and I am going to give it a try.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:38:36
That's incredible! Thanks. Here's 100 bits @_date: 2015-02-18 03:05:46
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:59:12
I know you don't like to show the balance as btc but people where I live only show amounts in btc. Would you be able to add a btc to bits calculator. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:19:08
And is that $500 instant with a bank account or credit?
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:06:25
Can you explain why?
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:57:20
The thing is that I feel that 5% is not significant enough for someone to want to exchange to get bitcoins. Seems too much of a hassle
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:03:44
So as soon as you added your bank account you were able to buy $500 instantly 
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:32:23
How did you convince the businesses to accept BTC? What did you say to them? Im cures I want to do the same.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:45:12
So you have a $500 instant buy on bank account?
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:33:24
Playing devils advocate, how is it any more secure than backing up your wallet on your computer?
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:39:13
Id have to agree with you there
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:43:23
How long did that take you to get?
