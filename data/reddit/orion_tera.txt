I feared the day you would come here, and kill crypto. RIP my beloved crypto.

He endorses freemarket and free legal exchange.

Its okay man, I admire your honesty.

Fiat is not backed by gold anymore, do your research and see that all that fiat is backed up by Is an endless chain of loan.

Not really, if you keep it for long term there it is fine. But try to use Segwit If you are to use it more regularly.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:40:41
If it does, this could be a huge thing I tell you.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:01:30
Those are risky things to deal with, that's why everyone wants to be part of it I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:50:32
Its not fake in the sense, its just bought, which I consider to be worse.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:43:40
Its increasing, lets reach 300k by the end of 2018!! lmao
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:46:21
Even if it takes a year to recover, we are still at a huge peak compared to last year. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:11:38
The thing is that people have seen and tasted it. If they want a black economy to start running there its their call. Drugs have been illegal, and has that helped? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:37:00
This is such a bad thing, considering the ever growing masses of people pouring into crypto daily.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:15:03
Hehe, its nice to be involved into something you put passion in it. Now you know the feeling, try to keep it until the rest your life, and you will be happy my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:53:35
She might be, but she is soon to become an asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:32:54
Great thread, exactly what I have been saying to my friends who are going all in, as if its a 100% risk proof scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:24:10
I will definitely buy crypto, but not all of them are going into one single coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:15
Don't panick mate, its still in an over 100% growth compared to where it was last month. Its just something regular with a hyper volatile market. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:38:05
Which government? Some are pro bitcoin , some are cautious. No one can tell you the truth, but have in that by some smart regulations bitcoin could be integrated just like gold is. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:09:35
I believe no delivery would occur prior to the merchant getting his money first.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:28
Haha, I love it. Extremely accurate depiction.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:42:36
Well that's the magic about it, if we knew who he is, it would no longer spark such huge interest into people. I think it is best for us to that Satoshi remains a legend.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:33:58
Bitcoin is a hyper liquid commodity, which is only formally called a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:55:09
In the times of old, people did it themselves, thus they have more money to buy bitcoin, sadly there was no bitcoin back then.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:54:15
Don't invest money, which you cannot afford to lose. This is the number one rule to any investor out there. Yes every now and then people win the "lottery" but have in mind that going all in, with money you cannot recover easily, is the best way to run your self bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:49:40
This would be a true test character, and blood pressure control pills. I dare not face this my own. It is already fast enough as it is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:18:07
I bought at $ 100. I still haven't sold. Not that I bought a lot, but it feel so good.

The Federal reserve might be complex in its operations, but its quite simple in its core values- "May all go to hell, but before that don't give me - but rather owe me your money."
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:31:52
Absolutely, I have been forseening that for last week. But I also believe that ethereum is also a coin that is going to get price increase.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:04:22
Similar times were back in the jazz age with the rising stock market. It is very dangerous when sheep follow the flock, not to hit a narrow spot, for they always ram themselves in the walls.

You should definitely buy, but wait for the dip right after the next fork. Even if it is only a small dip it will still give you a relative cheap entry. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:01:14
Once money starts pumping in, the politicians will start lobbying toward crypto interest, and  then things are going to get interesting indeed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:58:59
Bitcoin has been through a lot bigger dips in the past, there is no problem right now, we will be back on track soon.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:52:18
Bitcoin is a commodity dear people. And to back that up it behaves very similar to how precious metals fluctuate. And before people are offended for something decentralized it is better to behave that way, because the price stays true to the demand.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:35:46
They will eventually turn down, the demand for it is just way too high.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:20:35
Exactly, and once that happens we might even expect an even higher quality, because there would always be miners providing higher speeds at lower costs, due to competition over customers now, and not just simple generation of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:42:03
This gentleman knew how to HODL one hundred years ago. What would you excuse be for not HODLing today? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:38:23
I would like you to become my personal portfolio advisor.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:51:50
I'm afraid that those are franchises, which means that it is up to any individual franchiser to accept bitcoin or not, although I like the notion a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:55:04
Well if you are bored from long term investments, then maybe try "hodl"ing your positions, and you could try some high frequency trading with a small amount just to keep you interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:54:27
It is good that you have mentioned that, I was reading about it and thought that such things could be a massive deterrent to new people who wish to buy into the crypto but lack the tech knowledge.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:25:37
I was about to write a similar comment. This person is correct. There is never a 100% bust proof, but we are the closest we have ever been with bitcoin, so far.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:07:35
It is funny, because it is true.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:49:04
We will see 10k only after new year.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:27:07
So, many bookies seem to be in a rough situation right now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:00:25
We will go through it with ease. There is not much that you could atm else than hodl. Just keep it for a while and recovery is on its way.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:32:05
It is backed by a how crypto industry nowadays. This means that there is real demand that is involved, and not just some timely fashion which could die out pretty easily. It is a circulating financial platform, which actually yields an economical surplus, yes it might be decentralized and hard to be accounted but it is undeniable. This is the value it is backed by. Limited supply, high demand, high liquidity, a lot of actors involved, many applications. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:46:30
Quite a few positive derivatives could come out of that. As a matter of fact I this is the path more and more countries should embrace. All the crypto currencies at bound to become more and more popular and all that is left for governments is to embrace the new wave, and help it mature.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:10:31
We have been through quite a lot already, it is time for us to ascend toward the high heavens!
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:53:25
I say it is, but who am I to be taken seriously. Its just an opinion, which after all is the best you can get from here anyways.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:01:16
Maybe there should be work invested into popularizing, and building up trust. Don't you think that if more and more people had better understanding it would be beneficial in general?
