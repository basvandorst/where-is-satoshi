Shh. If you pay close attention, and use your head, you can make some money ;)
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:33:11
I think this is a good thing to note. Knowing that the value of the BTC can theoretically hit a billion and at the lowest end a user could still purchase just $1 USD worth. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:25:17
$500 worth, as a traditional trader in stocks I just pulled what I could spare from my brokerage and being a college student, $500 is significant. :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:49:15
I for one wouldn't argue if it was needed, nor do I think that anyone here would. 
This is good to know though, makes me even more confident in things.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:53:45
Don't use definitives when you're not sure. None of us know that it'll be back up. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, remember that.
That said, I too hope it rebounds.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:05:54
Thats what I though until I saw it drop from $200 to $140 a few minutes ago and back up
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:35:34
"most" is the key word here. Anyones guess really. Im meaning in more of a conversion type system. We all hold BTC, paypal could accept them as a means of funding your account, if you follow my train of though

VirtEx to start (Canada), than I transfered over to bitfloor when the prices were beneficial for me. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:11:03
Looks like it may be legit. Frozen at $120 with 0 lag.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:39:06
Coincidence, still not behaving for me! Shame too since I almost got an order in for more at $200
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:34
Essentially I pay close attention, find a reliable exchange that is consistent during times like right now. I'm using bitfloor for example. That is the essential part considering you need to be able to execute to make money. From there its waiting and watching trends and bounces, buy when you're comfortable with the price stable-ish. Don't be greedy, and goodluck! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:56:06
Why not! 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:45:05
Point taken, but it also may not get killed by the gov, furthermore it may not be as hard to implement as we think. Possibility of Amazon including their own affiliation with someone like mtgox. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:33:10
Be CAREFUL. 
Keep in mind if theres any delay in time to transfer as I'm seeing right now, you could stand to lose a LOT of money.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:02:28
I'm on mobile, so forgive me for any mistakes. 
I like the petition, a lot. It makes sense to me and I'm sure nobody would argue against it. If amazon accepts bitcoins, there will be a mass amount of people who become interested and also want to adopt. This adoption rate and curiousity can be nothing but good for bitcoin. 
When people begin to understand why bitcoin is beneficial to the average user, it will gain traction quickly. As one of the first few percentage of users to join twitter I agree. I heard nothing but complaints and now most of the world has been revolutionized as a result of a simple idea filling a need. This is what bitcoin does. 
If for no other reason than to keep up with amazon, eBay will follow suit. 
TL;DR : lets petition amazon to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:26:25
My fault, this is true.
edit: also, why do you think not this year or the next? I think Amazon specifically would significantly benefit from it. In your opinion how could they lose, assuming the BTC they collect was flipped to their accounts in USD when the transaction processes?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:41
tons of 0.02 transactions hit mt gox and then this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:27
Back for me, just got an order for about 2.5 through. Now hopefully this mtg lag calms the fuck down.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:17:35
Both gox and bitfloor are somewhat stable at 150
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:46:34
Go for it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:26:09
as I said above, what about paypal accepting BTC. indirectly ebay benefits while at the same time not harming paypal.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:51:01
back for me on my laptop, that buy order could be interesting though. lag is at 40 minutes for mt gox.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:00:40
interesting thought. Just doesn't feel right when its so much more than what the actual BTC price is. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:53:52
which do you use, out of curiosity?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:27
With you on the buy. Ive watched the price this afternoon and its the third time today its crashed for me, just be patient.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:55:32
got one in for 2.5 at about $203. Now I'm gonna go for a run and let this blow over a bit, good luck to you as well!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:43
Excellent, as do I expect it to as well, which is why I got more at $200.
I'm pretty jealous of $160 though thats awesome man.
Nonetheless I guess we'll know soon if our efforts were worth it, we can cry a bit together if we happen to be wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:35:38
I've been watching both mtgox and bitfloor. Bitfloor went down for a bit and since then the charts havent updated.
**edit: and its down again**
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:23:20
Wow... So during the crash I had made a good profit trading on peoples stupid decisions, literally hours before this bitfloor stuff started, I decided to move my funds: $750 (including my initial $500) to my Canadian account for an easy cash out to CAD if I needed it. BTC crashed hard literally in the hour I was waiting to move over and couldnt touch my funds, from about $150 to in the $60's (you all probably remember that) And when I was finally able to work it all out, my value was back to my initial investment of $501 I had all but lost my 50% gain.... I was pissed, but after seeing this, had I have not done that, I wouldn't even have the $500 right now.
Perspective my friends, what a thing.
**Edit: I feel for you though, especially being that close and dodging a bullet. Be safe ladies and gentlemen, make sure you trust your exchange! Good luck to all of you with this, hopefully the man isn't a scumbag and intends on keeping his word, if not, ready your pitchforks..**
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:13
If I assume correctly, you imply that the drop we're seeing now is proportionate to the last?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:25:40
This is a good point, although what about paypal &gt; BTC
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:50:02
I'm with you, amazon is a corporation looking to make money in the end. Bitcoin doesn't look to to be too much of a burdened for their existing systems, while giving them a potentially huge upside. Think about it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:47:59
That's the main idea, don't risk what you can't lose. I learned that quickly in the stock market and I plan on carrying that over to btc. But if you believe in the price level being higher month to month than I would suggest it. Personally I think the value could be very significant to the point where anyone holding on for long enough will profit very, very nicely while supporting the main message behind bitcoins. 
If you believe in a price, and you're willing to take the loss, why not right? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:06:55
Now that I think about it, you have a fair point here....
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:43:28
I'm not in for the money, and I'm not worried about dips. As a trader with other investments I know that things can turn quickly and I've conditioned myself to not panic. Thats for sure. Any suggestions on where to use them? In all honesty I would love to be able to contribute with them. I'll likely start getting into tipping around here as I become more active. I want to invest due to the potential. as I learned there is the potential 8 decimal points to bitcoin, to me this shows that the price has a very high ceiling while still being able to service in the penny to dollar USD range. Including this, anon online currency is presently hard to find. The only real alternative are prepaid master cards in set amounts.
For these reasons, I have joined in on bitcoin and look to spend them accordingly when I see a purpose that meets my needs. For example, online vendors ~~that I **may** have already used... ;)~~
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:07:12
I never really considered this, but this is what I wanted as an answer. If I had any of my coins here, I'd tip you. Thanks!
