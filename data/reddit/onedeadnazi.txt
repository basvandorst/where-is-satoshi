Dimon didnt change his opinion. He said he was always a fan of blockchain, just not in the concepts of crypto. This seems to still be in line with everything he said, tho kinda pathetic.

Ya I remember when Ver and r/btc coordinated in timing starting to call bch bitcoin. Wtf was that? Then i think he recanted and said it was all some mistake. Roger doesnt get that nobody wants him as the face of their coin.

Wtf is a bitcoin?

Always cringed at this comparison. Unless people figure out how to grow endless bitcoins to flood the market I dont see the correlation. 
Now rat poison squared on the hand...

Wouldnt it be cheaper to buy a massive bitcoin bat signal for outside every JP Morgan bank?

This is when I realized the level Antonopoulos was working on. His intellect and elloquence gives him a focused intensity. Many of his conferences sound like sermons so this was a really cool venue.

This is exactly why most exchanges will become decentralised.

Do you think his lawyer advised him to take to the reddit forums for help? Pretty unlikely. This account was likley invilved in some shady shit. Think about it.

Yup binance just locks up a shit ton of bitcoin for no reason and gives no explanation. OP not giving tx details. If you believe this bs good luck in life. Hope this likely scammer never gets a penny.

Binanace doesnt just lock up 1200 btc for no reason. OP clearly not telling the full story here. Hope you end up with dog shit as this money was likely stolen or acquired through fraud.
