Anything Google, so not only personal gmail accounts, but also company addresses that use Google Apps. I usually sign up with email+spam and have a filter that sends anything +spam straight to the bin.

Thanks. I do feel more at ease already. I'll probably keep checking the ticker from time to time, but won't feel as "I missed out"-stressed. 
And I made sure I used money I could afford to lose.

It might be worth putting something like "when making the transaction, I expect you to hand me over the money first, I will then proceed to transfer the funds" in your localbitcoins description. Then you already let people know up front.
It makes perfect sense to me to first give the cash (even escrow works kinda like that) and then send the coins.

Just bought the Humble Bundle Mobile 3 bundle with Bitcoin. It just amazes me how stupidly easy this is. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:55:57
Exactly! I'm even looking into getting a Bitstamp account. Would love to play with some smaller amounts.

Do they use Bitpay or another service? How do they calculate the bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:34:21
Yeah, that's what my coworker is saying as well. He repaid his pizza with BTC, which now means I can buy 3 pizzas myself, I'll use those probably, but that 1 BTC, I'll keep.
I was wondering: I use two factor authorization on blockchain.info. Should that be safe enough for 1 BTC, or (seeing the current prices), should I put it in cold storage anyway?

As a European, going to bed with MtGox at 680, I concur. 
"what, it's at 800? WHAT, it peaked at 900". Shiiiiit. So happy I bought my coin yesterday.

There's not that many stores here that accept BTC yet, so I won't be spending 100$ per week, but that does sound like a good idea. 
I am a firm believer that in order for bitcoin to succeed, we'll need to use it as well.

Also, no ads.

The night after purchasing my first BTC, I dreamt it completely crashed and I lost all my money. I sense a pattern. Glad to see that in a week, I've made a 33% profit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:36:16
That's another way of looking at it :p
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:49:12
Thanks for scaring me. I'll look into cold storage/paper wallet tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:48:29
Reminds me of someone else's comment I saw here: If we were able to see the future, we'd all be rich. 
I would've invested in Bitcoin, Tesla, Google, Microsoft...
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:58:05
I'm still very new to Bitcoin and I read the horror story from the user who lost 800 coins because his online wallet was hacked. Is this something we have to be scared of using bitpay/coinbase? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:46:42
Thanks. That's the idea. I like watching the markets to see how it evolves though. I'm not the type of person to panic sell though. I'd rather hold on to it than confirming I lost money.
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:56:59
Yeah, sounds like the best idea really. Thanks for the information. CEO is here tomorrow, will talk about it!
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:43:20
Yeah, you're not gonna win anyone over with that attitude. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:57:16
Awesome! Have you decided on a business model, how will you implement it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:35:59
Exactly. I purchased one with the intention of letting it sit for a while, as a more long term investment. I'm not planning on selling it in a few weeks and making 100 euro. I hope to be able to pay a nice holiday with it in a few years.
I'm considering buying smaller amounts of BTC, not as investment, but as currency for online shopping.
