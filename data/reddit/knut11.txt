"everybody" wouldnt know. Thats the key. Markets have so many unpredictable elements(and actors) , just like the weather. Both of them are based on chaos theory. Look it up dude.
@_date: 2019-03-12 19:12:06
Anarchy is not possible. The end result will always be people cooperating for a better life. So there will most likely always be some form of "goverment".
That being said.
I agree that the State has grown rapidly the last decades. So has population, production, social needs, debt, industry etc.
So the need for a state to regulate the growth has been nescesassry. Withou a state, big companies wold own the world even more than they do today.
There is a balance here. Maybe blockchain can solve many of our needs for governance.
For example most paperwork, taxes etc can be done autonomous.
Automation in generall will give us the possibility to free a lot of people from work.
Without a state, it will simply be the biggest/richest company that will own most of the autmation robots, drones and software.
Gentlemen. 
We stand on the edge of (r)evolution. Shaping the future is up to us (the geeks). There has never been more possibilities than now, but there is also an enourmous responsibilty!

"Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.[3] The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the Lyapunov time. "
You are a funny guy :)
TA is just one small part of being a profitable trader, this part is MAYBE 10% of the game. But then again, the point is not to predict what is happening next year, or even next month. Occasionally even long term weather forcasts are right.
Oh well, I hope the market dident chew you too hard up. I wish you health, success, wealth and happiness for the future!

Description is not facts. Random is only how it appears, when we lack data.
Just because we cant observe it, dosent mean its no underlying structure. The underlying structure is most often unseen.
Thats why long term weather forcast is almost never correct. There is simply too many varibles, for us to keep track of - still its there. And not random. It only appears to be.

Its a game of probabilities. Just like weather forcasting. Or forcasting any chaos based system.
Its not a crystal ball. Thats why risk managment and psychology is more important.
Actually TA/strategy only accounts for 10% of the game.
The casinos does not predict the outcome of every black jack hand played. But because they have ~1-2% statistical edge. They dont need to accurately predict each hand.
Same goes for trading. Its all about having a statistical edge over time. The edge itself is identified by TA. With the right risk managment, you can be wrong, more often than right; and still be a very profitable trader.

The problem is fractional reserve banking. Privat banking would be a free market thing, but its still a bank. Based on the same banking principles.
Inflation and interest, makes sure there is always more debt than value in the system.
Making "everyone" slaves to the banks, private or central.
Private banks/lenders backed by real assets like gold or Bitcoin; is the solution.

Oh yeah, and gold used to be a currency as well. (and should be again) But is now mostly a store of value.

@_date: 2019-10-25 11:34:08
Saleability implies to be sold for something, something like a medium of exchange. Or we are back to bartering.
Your house or car is not currency. Not the potatoes in your garden either. But they are saleable. Currency is too, but currencys main function is to be a medium of exchange. 
In a society; currency makes the flow of assets easier.
For speculation and store of value, Bitcoin awareness is increasing. But I m not so sure that's enough. If its not used as a means of exchange, it becomes an easier target for the coming central banks e currencies. A digital store of value is easier to attack, than a global digital currency.

Accepting only one currency as a digital company is not very likely.
And yeah, most use it at POS. Which is still adoption. 
This is a stepping stone in the right direction; versus holding and selling all at $1m.
Bch will most likely go to zero, so I wouldnt use that at all.
Much of the Bitcoin growth was due to black markets and alpakka socks. However most of the 2017 bullrun was FOMO and speculation.
My point is, I dont think FOMO and speculation is enough for Bitcoin (or any other crypto) to become sustainable. We need actual usecase beyond store of value.
To be more specific; we allready have other usecases, but more holders need to use them.

Banks were invented to store value. Kings used to distribute their own currency. Then the banks took over this role as well. Banks has had their role in creating the parabolic economical growth we have had the last 100 years. One of the main reason is the endless creation of debt. Cheap debt create exponential growth. By interest and inflation, banks ended up owning more and more of the real world assets.
We owe the system alot of gratitude. But it has become too powerfull and greedy.

I thinks thats the problem. Because most holders think like this. If no one is spending, places to spend will diminish. Which brings use closer to not being a currency at all.

Without the availability of cheap capital, the growth and advancment in technology would be alot slower. Dont misunderstand this; the banks are the riches and most powerful business in the world.

Bitcoin is internet money, you can buy almost anything online with it. (not anywhere, but you can get almost anything).
If you want to spend your bitcoins in the real world, there is a convertion step (usually).
But this is also true if you want to use your local fiat in a different country.

Bitcoin still has over 50% market cap. There are many cocacola copy, but cocacola is still nr 1. Why? Btc was the first, the father of all other coins. The trust has been built over 10 years. Sure, its a free wild wild west market. Anyone can copy and make a better version. But I dont think/hope this will be a coin based on the old bank system.
More and more understand/want that we need a descentralized economy. Based on math, and not trust in centralized mafia.
They just print endless money without real value. Thats why they want their own digital money; so that they can have negative interest, and create even more debt. Go read on the IMF blog.

No, I dont think this would be possible. My guess is that the BT can only be activated on the device. Not remotley.
Even if it was possible, the attacker would have to gain pysichal access to confirm the transaction on the device.
The only way to truley protect your funds, is to memorize the secret key and/or the seed words.
Ledger is very safe, and alot easier to use than memorizing keys yourself.
But there is a always a small chance it could maybe be exploited, under the right conditions ; pyschical access + your pin.
So, you trade a little of your security for a lot of convenience.
It may not be worth it for everyone.
But you know, its never a good idea to keep all your funds in one place. If I buy this device, I would only keep portions of portifolio on there for easy access thorugh a phone (for spending).
Just like a bank account, you should not keep all your savings on your debitcard.

VAT is good for regulating consumption. And I thinks it's fair to pay a tax in relation to how much you consume. The more you consume, the more of an impact you are on infrastructure, society, resources and the enviorment.
But the use of that money, also have to be fair. And the use should be registered in a blockchain for all contributors to see! 
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:17:34
I think there are very few companies that use 100% crypto. Thus they can pay taxes in fiat. You dont pay tax on losses.
More adoption = less volatility. 
The point still stands, if crypto is not used as currency, the value slowly diminishes.
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:13:07
Cash is still private. You can get cash by working "off the books", and then spend it on the black market. No taxes.
Most serious businesses would not allow you to purchase without VAT. 
So I guess this would be enforced like we do it today. A business does not have the same privacy rights (or need) as a humanbeing.

“I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”

Noobs do this, yes.
Professionals use TA a bit different:
1. Describe a hypotesis
2. Find support and resistance
3. Define the trend
4. Calculate Risk to Reward ratio.
The next phase of the experiment, is to see if the hypotesis play out in the chart.
If it does, the trader will take profits at a predefined point (partly or fully).
If the hypotesis was wrong, the traders completes the experiment by taking a loss at a set price.
TA is not a crystal ball, but some patterns tend to repeat themsevles more often than others. Giving a diciplined trader an edge. Very few are able to capitalize on this edge. Which is why nubs lose money, even when they get an accurate TA from a "Guru".
TA is only 10% of this game. 70% is your head. 20% is your risk management.
90% of traders will never make money. And often they blame TA instead of themselves (mentality).
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:51:56
Your TA is spot on. I believe FA plays a more significant role now, than in the past. 5-6k is a possible scenario, but I dont think we will stay low for long. In May we will go from 1800 btc per day, to 900 per day.
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:51:20
1800 BTC is created daily, but I dont think a lot of them enter the open market.
Sure, a lot of miners need to sell because of mining costs.
But a lot of miners is wealthy after previous bullruns. They dont need to sell.
Mining can also be a way to invest in BTC, and accumulate coins. 
Nobody will hold for ever. Bitcoins are being spent daily, and replaced daily. Volume is steadily increasing. 
The author is describing a scenario where Bitcoin is illiquid. Which it is not. And most likely will not be in the nearest future. If it happends, yes, BTC is then dead.
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:58:43
Carefull on those magical cookies brother! ��
Supply and demand. He is saying that 18,000,000$ has to enter the market daily for the price to not go down.
As long as there are buyers, the price will not be zero. And the transactions cant go to zero as long as there is buyers.
But, I dont think 1800 coins enter the market. I think a lot of miners keep alot of their coins.
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:22:52
Yeah.. My opening statement: 90% fail. So yeah, "bullshit for almost everyone".
If you are among the 10% that actually do make money over time. You can make money in other markets as well. The same rules apply to almost any market.
But there is alot of selfproclaimed "super smart hedge fund managers" out there. Especially during, and after a bullrun. Where almost any dumbdumb can make big gains, thinking it was skill. And then get rekt.
Trading is a zero sum game.
@_date: 2019-09-08 11:00:12
90% fail. With the correct dedication, one can master anything.
Unfortunately, most players enter this game with hopes of quick gains and easy riches.
Which is not the case. Trading is 10% strategy, 20% risk managment and 70% mentality.
Its a very easy game, with simple rules. However most of the game revolves around Greed and Fear. Which are human emotions, really difficult to master.
Most give up way before they experience enough emotional pain, to really learn about their own mentality.
However, anything is possible. Given the correct amount of focus, dedication and discipline.
If anyone wants to learn from the best, I can highly reccommend "Trading in the Zone"
For some the way to the correct mentality is short and easy, but for most its long and hard.

That blew my mind.
Btc is a world wide currency, and someone can in an worst case scenario, pretend to be the actual majority of the nodes, which is false.
But even with 51% the attacker would still have to process normal transactions in order to be in control of the network, because if they don't 49% of the nodes will have delayed transactions. Which on a grand scale will be noticed fairly fast.
Even with 51% it would require quite a bit stability and patience to benefit. If the goal was to mess up the system, every block can be tracked back and restored as per before the attack. 
Lets hope no one ever gets to controlled/manipulate 51%! Power to the people!
