Bitcoin gold doesn't claim on multiple sites to being the same as bitcoin.

Missleading new buyers into thinking theyre buying bitcoin,
Saw an example in another comment, would it be ok for them to call it bittcoin or bitcoinn?

Thats not what I said, "ffs". Theres multiple BIG sites claiming that Bcash and bitcoin is the SAME. I have invested in both bcash and bitcoin but I think it's important to seperate the two. Don't take everything as an attack and aggression.

To make it easier for new investors to seperate the two. If we want the general public to start using it then it can be pretty confusing, dont you agree?

I never said I supported one over the other. I've invested in both and keep investing and selling in altcoins.

He said "probably", speculation

It was just called bitcoin wallet i think, dont have the phone to see but I basically just typed bitcoin wallet into the app search bar and took the one that looked the absolute simplest. Yes, I am cringing as im typing

I had not read into it at all except hearing that it was a type of crypto, which was wrong of me. 
apparently its a sort of system to "tip" mobile broadcasters(?i think?)
Ill be taking down the thread

Absolutely. I wish I could go back and change it. Was saving up for an appartment and the fact that i'd throw away so much money makes me so mad.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:58:17
Yeah I really wish i did. Lesson learned I guess. Gonna get a Ledger nano s as soon as i save up some money to but btc again.

Well it was in Christiania so rip.

It was the most basic of wallets, litteraly just an adress to store stuff, which now I know isnt enough (and shouldve known tbh). In the future if I ever decide to buy again I understand that using electrum or similar services is a lot safer.
