almost every person i have convinced to get into bitcoin has opened their phone and automatically gone on bitcoin.com. I have to steer them away and explain why this site is cancer.

I think this hurts Bitcoin adoption. People are going to look at mobile payments and think that it's not trustworthy, even though Bitcoin will never have this kind of flaw.

You can't change the transaction fee which I find annoying

Random person on Facebook sent me this. I think I convinced him he's involved in a scam either way people stay away! 
"Hey if your looking for Bitcoins. I wouldn't go for that, as before when Bitcoin were the big thing, everyone made they're fortune. Now it's very hard to maintain that. Whereas there's a new Cryptocurrency launched 2 years ago and already has 2million members. All of the members are mining there tokens to get coins as they will be valuable in coming year or two. It's value of onecoin is €6.27 per coin (every month increaes). It's gonna be huge. Wouldn't you like to grab some coins before we launch it to the market exchange? If you like to know more info about it? I have many websites and video links explaining why this new Cryptocurrency is gonna be bigger than Bitcoin. If your not satisfied then no problem. Only reason I'm sharing this as I don't want anyone to miss out.
Thank you and keep in touch"
