Look at the price since I posted this... indicators ;)

Fair enough

Sounds like the consensus here!

All you need to do is accurately predict it 51% of the time, and there are many indicators to help you reach that number.

Why is that?

That's pretty good! You should design one of the Rare Pepe cards for Series 16. This series is only accepting hand drawn submissions. You would definitely get yours accepted and can make a pretty penny off of it.

I mean that's smart... but unless you have a nice sum of money sitting in there then you won't be *super* excited when it goes up 50-100% over a long period of time. Alts allow you to capitalize while bitcoin is stagnant or falling.

To capitalize. If you know bitcoin isn't going up for a little bit... you might as well double or triple your bankroll while it falls, and then get back in with a larger investment. Win Win.

Mining is hard... collecting Rare Pepe is much easier and wayyy more money to be made with less investment:

Yea, there are definitely other sites out there that do the same thing. I just figured there was room for a few. Maybe the value is just in the domain name. I guess I could try to sell it to one of those other sites if they don't have that great of a domain. Thanks!

Look into mining ACoin... it's up 4200% since Jan 1st 2017. Whatever you mine today could be worth a whole lot more a year down the road.
