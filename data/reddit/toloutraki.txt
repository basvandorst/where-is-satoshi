What happened to this? I was looking forward to it.

I got an email at 3:00 AM telling me that the coins I bought are now available. Well, I got the same email on the same transaction earlier in the day. So they double-emailed me. I think something funky is going on! I'm almost to L2 so I don't have to worry about buying coins and waiting 7 days to get them. Woohoo!

I'd bet that prices fall back to ~$100 by close.

I'm expecting a small lag. I really just want the coins the same day I buy them. Ideally within a few hours.  I'd be interested in understanding where they get the coins from. Is Coinbase an actual exchange? Or do they buy and take ownership of coins to resell?

That's good to know! Odd as it sounds, I haven't really been sure about using them as a wallet. Though I'm thinking about adding Bitcoin payment processing to a website I own and they have the most flexible and brandable interface. They seem to be rather honest and secure which is a point but I have noticed that they are slow. I sent some coins to Gox earlier to dump and it took them 2 hours to get it into the network and confirm it. Gox actually showed the coin before it left pending status. Go figure.
And, I know I mentioned speed, but I'm selling into fiat and not too worried about the delays on Gox at the moment. I just don't like buying at Coinbase and running the risk of BTC values plummeting within the 7 days it takes to get my coins!

Anything you might recommend? I finally just took a look at bitbox. They seem decent.

Thank you!

They look kind of shady...

Let's hope not...

Thank you SO much!

That's not totally off the table. I have wanted to hold a European bank account for a while because I occasionally travel there, alas I won't be back for a few months and wanted to get the show on the road.

Absolute truth. Thank you!
