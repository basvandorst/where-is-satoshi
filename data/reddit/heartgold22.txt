Considering that it is the fastest growing school of economic thought, he might be wrong. Of course, nobody knows the future though.

Haha apparently you were wrong! I have no ides why but it seems cryptocurrency communities are very charitable. From Dogecoin giving $40k to that Jamaican sled team to the Reddit Gold shower. 
When immigrants use to hear of America they heard of streets paved in gold, and similar to that in the rain is gold.

Ah, thank you for the answer!
To all the downvoters: Fuck you all; correct me instead of just putting me down.

It is very much so. If I were to start a government, or rather an entity that has monopoly on the initiation of aggression over a certain area, and then sent my armed personnel to break into your property, thus aggressing your rights, would that not be stealing?

That would be awesome. However, it shouldn't be from a app like Authy since the criminal could just look at that app and get in the wallet lol

You can always shut your phone off, and I assume it wouldn't load your information if it was in cold storage, i.e. Coinbase. However, if it isn't in cold storage I would assume that it could be stolen (?) If so, there needs to be a failsafe built in a phone so that when it gets shut off the Bitcoin gets locked in and a special key must be entered.

Happy birthday! I hope it has been a good one

Lockscreens aren't as difficult to break as you would think. Not that I know personally, but there are people who know how to hack phones.

I will make sure I use your service the next time I need a hotel room!

Really anything is fine. However, be careful and do not dive into the heavy stuff like Mises' *Human Action.* Buy basic books and make sure you understand the vocabulary even if that means stopping and researching the definition of countless words. I regret that I did not do this when I read Ron Paul's *End the Fed* because if I had then I would have had fully understood it.

Can somebody fully explain the situation to me?
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:59:01
LOL You Aussies have nothing to complain about, what about Japan, New Zealand, and the Phillipines? They are not even in the picture.
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:03:26
Maybe I have my definitions messed up? Coinbase is cold storage, yes?

What do you mean by "psychology"?
