ELI5 what is a bitcoin block, and why does it have a size?

I thought we were supposed to aspire to have a Swiss Bank account? Isn't that part of the American Dream?

It's still as much of a stock as it is a currency.

I've heard of you. You're kind of a big deal.

The point is that it's still around and that it's only shrunk to 1/5 it's total value, compared to its [growth of 50 to 100 times since around when I first heard of bitcoin]( (but of course I didn't take it seriously so I brushed it off). 


*Execution* is all that matters. And that takes time. You can get the best idea in a split second. Still takes time to execute that idea flawlessly, which is what the market expects.

I'm a n00b in the world of bitcoin so feel free to correct me but doesn't there have to be a way to intelligently divide up the *entire blockchain* amongst nodes/users (not sure if those are synonyms or actually different)?
Bittorrent does this pretty well. 10 seeders on a tracker could only have 10% of different parts of the file, yet a new leacher could still download the file in its entirety.
Why not do the same with blockchain? Then each user can set the % of the blockchain they want to adjust for their convenience / security tradeoff.
 
Then scaling network wide scaling is O(nm) and the individual scales as O(m) where  m &lt;= n, but m is proportional to n (since m is a % of n).

He does make this point at the end.

Would this help with variable block sizes or subsets of all blocks? 
My knowledge base of btc is small compared to many on this sub, but one thing I've never really "got" was why there can't be a system for variable levels of participation that allow you to not need to sync every block. E.g. A node only needs to download some % of all blocks if the node has limited bandwidth. Torrents work like this; even if I've only download 1% of a file, I can still seed that 1%.
I'm sure there are technical reasons this may not have already been implemented but segwit sounds like it could be a step towards variable participation levels for nodes.
(Also I'm kinda drunk so maybe this sounds stupid...)

i'm confused. are you talking about pyramid schemes?

they switched owners or something after v2.2.1. I still use that one.

i think it would be nice for the volatility to go down, but i doubt that will happen soon.

I just thought it was funny. It's probably not even close enough to read if you're driving near them on the highway. You obviously don't have to donate if you don't want to.

Why get money out of exchanges?

I still would have thought "green" was interculturally symbolic with money though, but interesting!

Bitcoin adoption feels like that of a new programming language. People might like some of the ideas it brings, but they won't use it as they fear it might not be developed and/or maintained in the future, and still "too new to be useful.", or just for a slew of other technical reasons/preferences. Just give it time.

probably some low sample issues on best books thus far.
