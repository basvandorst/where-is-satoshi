I wasn't talking about the price. I am sure BTC will continue to rise, it is the de-facto gold standard of crypto. The gold standard narrative is strong, it's just that I see it for what it is now. BTC of 2015 was a whole other beast.

You're right, only bitcoin can ruin bitcoin. SV was fun to watch btw, and it was a great way to double BCH holdings.

lol, hell no, I don't want stability. Stability is boring, and gives you 0 opportunities to make money. How about we make BTC "stable" at $10k, would you like that?

It's enough that everyone believes that everyone believes that they do back it 1-to-1, and the price will be fixed to reflect that belief.

Also US ACH support, TransferWise support, Easy registration (e-mail &amp; phone verification, set PIN), KYC done in 15min (pic ID, selfie, wait a little) and [fair market prices with no markup]( same like buying on exchanges, competitive credit card fee (3.5%)

Lol, relax, it's just another stablecoin (a basket of them, to be more precise) which is overhyped because it has these names associated with it. It's good for legitimizing crypto.
At the end, it will enable even more people to buy BTC. Libra has 0 investment/speculative value since it's linked to the underlying asset, but it will enable people to transfer value to exchanges and purchase speculative crypto more easily. Libra also has 0 decentralization since the pegger gets to choose which fork would be backed by the assets.
