What if you could play Powerball thousands of times a second...Because you can definitely do that with private-keys. Bet the odds are considerably different when you take that into consideration.

The odds of solving a bitcoin block are 1/1,619,376,900,000,000,000,000
you would only need to solve about 3 blocks to have the same odds. Thanks for helping me grasp the size of the numbers though...

He is close on the timeline but its been multiples of 10 from the last ATH. So it should me more like; this crash to $1200-$1500 followed by $200,000 crashing back to $21,000-$25,000.

I'm likely wrong but I based this "guess" on the past, nov/dec 2013 as well as the data from 2009 - now. I don't see it falling below the last ATH following the halving. I think it will be close to the ATH in 2013 before if flattens out and starts making a turn 2020 sometime. Should reach all time high again sometime mid to late 2021. This is all speculation and in reality I have no idea what I'm talking about. I hope I'm right, only time will tell.
