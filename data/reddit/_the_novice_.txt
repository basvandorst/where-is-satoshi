No offence, but l've been using a few other cryptos, and this seems expensive and slow.
Stellar, Digibyte, Vertcoin, PIVX are all way way cheaper and quicker too.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:32:33
DGB or PIVX centrally controlled....LOL
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:26:36
I disagree
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:53:23
Bullshit. BTC Markets is way better and offer more coins. Stop shilling!
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:48:54
Why not? You have to start somewhere...
So you just want to accept 2 cryptos?
I just went to a Chinese Yum Cha and they accept 3 cryptos - We Pay, Ali Pay (coin) and 1 other
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:13:22
....because of all the bogans flying Jetstar?

Have a Ledger/Trezor
Have multiple accounts (pass phass/25th word seed) - put $500 in a phoney account.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:32:02
Wait, are there people really against Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:51:12
Oh well, your fucked then ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:13:28
Your saying that Stellar, PIVX, Vertcoin or Digibyte isn't as secure as Bitcoin. That's what l disagree with. And your wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:20:26
Thank you for posting this.
Deep down l feel that there is a conspiracy against Bitcoin, from Ver and BCash.
Coinbase (Armstrong) is in-bed with Ver and BCash.
The other Armstrong lied, so is this one
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:49:45


How about adding Digibyte or Stellar?
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:50:15
Pro, only offering a handful of coins to trade...
Has Coinbase enabled ERC20 tokens yet?
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:03:23
This is Gold!!! Bitcoin Gold.....
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:57:41
nice. Well done
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:55:16


Which is what l do on my Ledger. Exactly the same - set up with 24 word seed and a seperate 25th pass-phase word. I actually think it should be mandatory on both the Ledger and Trezor to set up a 25th word. But, people will still write down the pass-phase on the same paper - humans are dumb.

I regularly make new accounts and have been using Reddit for 5+ years....
I have a different Reddit accounts on my mobile to my laptop
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:42:36
There are only really 3 hardware wallets out there in the market place
Ledger Nano S
Trezor Model 1
Trezor Model T
That's it
Ledger Blue will be discontinued and the Keep Key is nothing (no one uses it).
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:41:24
Trezor Model T?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:26:01
Can you please provide a link to the official report from the creditors meeting.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:11:04
Still too expensive
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:29:53
This was almost confirmed in 10 seconds
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:33:02
Yeah yeah yeah. I do new accounts randomly. Been on Reddit for more like 4 years...
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:53:02
Thank you. Much appreciated
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:14:43
Getting separated now....
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:14:20
Buy now and hold. You'll be surprised. HOLD HOLD HOLD
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:52:55
The Bitcoin core developers are the best. These guys are doing it for love. No malice
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:18:19
I agree, there should be an option to change - light or dark theme....
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:21:43
Pineapple Fund - well done. your a very humble person. 10/10
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:28:42
This is the main point that those on r/btc are missing.
He is misleading newbies....
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:48:51
Something has to be done about this.
