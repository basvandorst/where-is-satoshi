I think its for easy trading.  I can send the cars value over the internet at an instant for free instead of sending an actual car which will take a couple weeks and cost a couple hundred dollars.  The car can be traded 1000 times and with the coins the fees will be minimal until you cash out the coin.

The hyperinflation makes your debt worthless. If you have $5 your money becomes worthless. If you owe $5 your debt becomes worthless.

I don't know man. He offered online gambling in the USA which is illegal. If I sold drugs to Singaporeans and then visited Singapore I would probably be executed. (Please note that I support the legalization of online gambling and the legalization of recreational drugs)

A sandwich in 2014 costs $5. I put it on my credit card. In 2015 hyperinflation hits. A sandwich in 2015 now costs $5,000. I still only owe $5 but now it is only worth $0.001 in terms of 2014 dollars. My debt is now worth less than before.

People usually take out mortgages when they buy properties. Lets assume they took out $100,000 loan to buy property A. If hyperinflation hits the loan will be worth considerably less. Lets say it is worth $1,000 now in terms of pre inflation fiat. After hyperinflation debt will be worth less. The reasonable move to make would be to take out massive loans before hyper inflation purchase inflation resistant assets and have the loans be devalued. Why don't you take out massive loans in fiat if it is so worthless? Go for it. Why are you even accepting fiat? Why don't you put it all in Bitcoin? Sell all your assets take out as many loans as you can and put it in Bitcoin if you are so sure of the collapse of the dollar and hyperinflation.

I have a fixed rate mortgage. My interest doesn't change with inflation. A variable rate loan is a fools game.

Basically if it is banned all almost all US services would stop accepting it. The majority of the Bitcoin community is based in the US so it will be a big blow. There will be a massive price drop possibly to single digits. Everyone holding Bitcoin will be burned people will not want to accept it after they were burned so bad. Cue a downward spiral where the price decreases. The majority of miners will not mine without a financial incentive the bitcoins won't be worth the electricity used to generate them. All the US has to do is temporarily redirect some supercomputers to launch an attack.

How? Just buy low sell high. Unless Bitcoin is cracked the price will eventually go up 90% of the time.

Lol are you stupid? 
All the government has to do to fuck bitcoin is ban it. They will then dump all the bitcoin they have. Prices will drop down back to single digits. Literally 95% of the bitcoin economy will be wiped out. Since the miners won't mine because of the incredibly high dificulty and low compensation the government will easily launch a 51% attack.  Poof bitcoin is gone.

Personally I don't think taxes equate to slavery and if they do I would rather be a slave than sit in prison. Prison is a bad place to be with a large amount of violent criminals that don't think about the impact of their actions.

For the foreseeable future government will be necessary you are stupid if you think that a system so ingrained could be toppled by grassroot movements.

Isn't bitcoin based on faith rather than intrinsic value?  A bitcoin is worthless if nobody wants to take it or buy it from you. Let's just see how it develops before we pass judgement.

A dick. He vouched for Mt Gox after they asked (bribed) him to. Mt Gox shut down a couple days later he had his money already out. He later gives a bs apology. I feel no sympathy for him. There was some other stuff he did with some blockchain info but im not sure of the specifics. He is just a super shady guy who I wouldn't trust with a dollar.

Taxes mean that nobody will directly attack the USA. They allow the construction of roads and infrastructure they provide subsidies for utlities. They provide an education system. Idk they seem pretty good to me. I don't agree with everything they are spent on and there is a lot spent on bureaucracy and corruption but overall they allow us to function. Not everybody is like you. Taxes will change if they can't tax the individual they will shift it to sales tax and business tax. If they are threatened to the point of collapse I could easily see them turn into a police state.

You said that the other shop owner makes more money. How can they have that money if there is no place not controlled by a mob.

Imprisonment on failure to pay would motivate the majority of the populace to pay.

It only takes a couple of people going to jail to make most people pay their taxes. Would you rather pay your taxes or go to jail?

Not if the USA experiences hyperinflation, but that has less than a slim chance of happening.

I kinda think making the decision not to act hurts more than not having the information available earlier. Since one person made a conscious decision not to act while the other person didn't have a chance to act.

I know that feeling.  Millions were in your grasp you just had to close your hand but you didn't and now they slipped away.  It just hurts.
