Teslas are based, why are you leasing a shitty Nissan? Leasing literally makes no sense at all and cost 10 times more than buying a car.

Unless you are terminally ill and only need to drive something for 2 months, there are no numbers that you can crunch to justify leasing. It's amazing that so many car companies have convinced the general population that there is any financial advantage to leasing a car.

We own guns and have laws protecting free speech which is more I can say for most countries in Europe, including the UK

HAHAH. the cucked UK is complicit in the extradition of Assange. It is a global deep state that goes beyond boarders. At least here we have some sort of access (although the globalist are trying to stop us) to weapons to fight against tyranny. USA is NUMBER FUCKING ONE. Don't be jealous because our madlad experiment actually worked, be glad it happened! Now lets fight the international zionist that work to tear our nations apart and live in a free open society together brother! It has always and will always be Israel

Hahaha. Imagine living in the authoritarian shit hole that is the EU. Unelected officials from another country get to impose any restriction on your day to day life that they see fit. The also shove as many refugees into your country as possible tho. Fuck your culture, fuck your people, and you're a racists populist if you want to leave the EU.. hahaha and also the braindead boomers who wrote this law obviously do not understand crypto in the slightest.
