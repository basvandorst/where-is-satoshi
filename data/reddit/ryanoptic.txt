Do you still need it then?
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:09:58
fuckin A I missed it :(
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:08:22
And it's the same as my first story but awesomely edited and ready for mass appeal!
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:45:57
I tried. What do you think?
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:04:35
So it worked?
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:25:35
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:04:13
I wish I knew how to join that I don't even know how to become eligible. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:22:22
Excuse my ignorance Paltry but what is Typhoon? I was trying to sell the story as a .rtf but I'm not sure to actually get a link for that. I'm not that tech savvy. Any help would be cool.Thanks.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:47:13
Haha. Good. I appreciate your enthusiasm. My next mssion:Keep writing story 2! :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:01:19
I see. Can I send you a copy for free then? I'd like to get it out there. It's an exciting story. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:54:57
Very nice. I wish more people were interested in this technology. Did you read the story? Was it interesting?
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:35:20
Okay. I'm going to try it.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:06:19
:). Sounds awesome. I'm off to the doctor. Let's chat later and see what we can come up with!
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:26:31
PM'd you the link
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:41:37
I will send it later after the editing is done. Definitely. Thank you for rhe suggestions. I'm going to class right now but will be back home in 5 and a half hours and will get you the revised version. Thanks again :) 
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:55:53
Oh really? So what do you use?
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:58:22
I love it. This whole thing is pretty awesome. I mean how it really works. It's very interesting. I think doing it, like setting up electrum, looking at Xapo, making a transaction or two is really way more valuable than just reading the theories.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:40:31
I totally got rid of it and changed it to a txt. document.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:21:49
Sweet. I'd love to start a website dedicated to writers where the popular or unique stories get lots of tips. I'd like to host contests too. But anyway, thanks for the interest. Looking forward to your feedback.
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:04:45
yeah, that was me. It's the same story, This format let's me sell it before being read though.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:40:43
What wallet do you use primarily to hold most of your larger amount of coins? Do you use cold storage? And what is that exactly? Sorry if I'm asking too much. I'm just really interested.
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:08:58
Yes. I will definitely add my next story to tiphound too but I don't know why more people didn't read first. If I actually make some real money with a bok I'm gonna come back and hit you with a huge tip!
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:03:12
Okay. Thank you again. What program creates txt files?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:01:26
Well. I'm going to have to redo the whole thing because of it being a doc which is not a good format apparently due to a lot of viruses ect.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:00:54
This might sound really dumb but what is QR? I will rewrite and do it in .pdf. I've had a lot of feedback which I'm amazed by because I didn't expect any. There are a bunch of typos and bad punctuation which is embarrassing. I'll definitely refund it if it's too horrible :(
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:41:27
Keep us updated! I thought you were saying something about your girlfriend up there. You might want to change that so some people don't get confused.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:26:07
Hey did you want a refund?
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:18:50
Thanks so much crainb. I'll give way better tips than this once I become a best seller lol. 500 bits.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:46:49
Haha. Did you read it? Was it catchy at al? What do you suggest to make it better?
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:04:00
I just signed up with Xapo...Any knowledge of them?
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:11:43
No problem. It happens to me every day lol. I appreciate your help.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:51:19
I know that's a really dumb question but I'm brand new to all of this. I'll definitely tip you a really big tip once I build my account a little as an offer of goodwill for you actually sending me a free shirt. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:54:53
Does electrum have private keys associated with it?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:51:32
Wow. I suck lol. Thanks so much for the review. I can see exactly what you mean. It was way too disordered. I guess I was trying to show how my mind was working that day too but the reader wouldn't appreciate that now that I read it like you read it. I'll keep trying and hopefully come out with some better stuff. Maybe I'll find an editor to help me with the whole project. Feedback like this gives me the inspiration to move forward though. Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:45:36
Wow. Please keep in touch and maybe we can share notes...What's your thesis on? I'm currently finishing my bachelor's and am working toward a master's eventually even though I'm a feel a little old to be still trying t finish my degree.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:04:21
:) :) :) You made my day. I want to make a site where we can invite writers to do this kind of thing and sell there stuff for mBitcoins. I'm so new to the whole thing, both writing and Bitcoin though. I figured I gotta start somewhere.
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:49:33
I just send a nominal amount from Xapo to my electrum wallet. Should I change the address now for my electrum wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:01:49
Ah ha. Awesome feedback. I'm just learning the ropes. Thanks for the suggestion and the complement :)
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:11:36
It was a hypothetical. I like the idea but I honestly don't even have $30 in btc right now and I'm guessing $30 is gonna be way to much for most people to want to pay for a T-shirt.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:29:01
Yeah, I don't expect to make any money right away and it's really just a way to add motivation right now. I haven't written formally ever and these new ideas are really inspiring me to start. I do hope to make money at some point with a novel. I need to start somewhere.
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:23:19
Hey man. Thanks :) Great idea. I hope the people and charities appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:39:17
Thank you everyone. I'm very new to this stuff so all the answers were awesome! I think I'm going to investigate electrum.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:40:59
That's so awesome man! I'm glad I did it but I feel like and idiot for the dumb errors. I guess I sold a rough copy which s kinda cray lol. Did you like the overall story?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:35:59
How can I integrate a proof of existence? Thanks for the info and interest.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:15:02
This is the link.  I was thinking about linking it to FB too but I don't think any of my friends even have btc. I lowered the price to .001 btc so it's almost free, but you're right most stories are just plain free.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:30:44
*edit* did
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:06:19
I guess is similar and actually looks cooler lol
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:39:17
I guess it's going to have to be a trust thing if anyone wants a refund because it I think it takes a little while for the payments to show up in my Xapo wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:30:16
Dod it seem like there was a way for me to add that manually since satoribox really doesn't have those options?
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:53:48
I uploaded to satoshibox. We'll see if I get any hits. I might have priced it too high. .005btc but it took me a lot of time and it was a traumatic experience that is kind of entertaining to read. I hope lol.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:04:32
Maybe a solution would have been better than adding to the problem....That's just me though.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:26:26
Were you able to get the story?
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:57:46
Wow. Yeah. I would have sent it back. It was like 8 buck and change lol. Even though I think my new stories will be worth that, this one, not so much lol. The payment didn't go through though so it's all good :). Thanks so much for the interest. Did you get the story?
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:55:05
Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. 500 bits. I'd give you a lot more if I had more than a dollar so far lol.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:08:07
Hahaha I guess I really fucked up. But it seems like I might have a new way to easily hack my college. They only want doc files for hw. Now I just need to find out what makes docs so frowned upon and then how to load em up with viruses. Then I can even write another short story about that experience!
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:38:50
I now have an electrum wallet! Can I send my tips from changetip to my electrum wallet if I accumulate some?
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:36:26
Lol. I actually had to redo it after first making it a Word Doc. I had no idea that Word was highly infected. Some people schooled me and told me to change it to .txt. Thanks man. Definitely not a virus.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:39:14
What if I send the 5 dollars in BTC and I change my mind? Will you send the $5 back?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:43:14
Okay. I never heard of it lol. I'm kind of a nerd but haven't paid much attention. Would love to learn the nerd stuff that I've ignored. How do I do it? I'll read about it! Thanks for the info :)
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:04:30
Did I make it?
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:09:45
Lol is that real?
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:23:58
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:41:39
Awesome man!!!! Thanks. Do you want the story?
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:13:00
That's pretty awesome dude. How do I PM exactly? I know that sounds stupid lol but I'm very new to reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:37:18
Yes. Thanks so much for the tip man:).
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:22:17
I love the idea. Just read the basics. Awesome! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:14:34
LOL. I looked for awhile for that. Where the hell is that located?
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:11:16
Ugh. That's weird...I will send you a better link in a little while.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:18:38
Haha thanks. I can tell you were using Swype. Gets/keys. I hate that. I'm thinking of eliminating gets from my dictionary.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:23:51
I do. I use Firefox but I don't have an edit button that I see. Strange.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:32:49
Awesome. Thank you 500 bits.
