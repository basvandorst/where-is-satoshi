At this point, I don't think Mt.Gox is going to have an "again."

Crazy swings.  I don't see bitcoin getting any real stability until MtGox is shut down.

I think people bought in under the assumption that the 750k coins are not truly lost and Gox depositors will recover a substantial portion of their accounts.  
If we get solid confirmation the "cold" wallet was stolen, I see another crash happening before the true recovery can begin.

SWIFT is not a money transfer mechanism.  It's an organization geared towards providing and defining standard ways to transmit transaction information between members, but it doesn't actually move the assets.  Member institutions settle via other intermediaries and mechanisms.  Bitcoin would probably be a pretty good fit for SWIFT to support, actually.

[serious question] I've browsed the threads at bitcointalk, but it isn't clear to me how they're handling the transactions--how are they arranging things so that the gox coins go to a gox account and the btc go to the receiver's wallet without shenanigans?

How do withdrawals work?  Also, are open orders good until cancelled or filled, or do they all come down at 11?

Exactly.  I was using MtGox because I perceived it to be the most reputable of the exchanges--sure there were issues with getting dollars in or out, but they're the ones CNN is talking about, so surely they're not a fly-by-night operation that will evaporate on a moment's notice.
Their current inability to transfer even bitcoins out of my account has utterly destroyed any trust I have had in them.  It's my fault, I didn't do my research and just trusted what seemed like the biggest and most stable name.  
I've since learned of their history of mysterious technical and regulatory issues and radio silence during these incidents.  The lack of transparency and poor communication is especially troubling.  Their latest statement made demonstrably false statements.  Users with "stuck" funds have not all been refunded. I am one of them.  My account is zero, nothing is on the blockchain, and the coins have not been transferred.
I won't accuse them of fraud or theft, but the kindest words I have for them right now are that maybe they mean well, but are just appallingly incompetent.
Nothing about this issue or MtGox in general passes my smell test anymore.

This.  I honestly thought they were the most reputable.  Boy was I wrong!
And it's my own damn fault for not doing the due diligence, these jokers have no business playing at being a financial company.

Boredom.   Nothing else to do but try to get a "high score."  Maybe someday we'll be able to cash in our chips.

I'd worry about how much of the stolen 750k hasn't been fenced yet.   That's a lot to bleed off.
