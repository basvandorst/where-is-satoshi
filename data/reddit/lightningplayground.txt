Wouldn't they be unidirectional channels? I am trying to understand the outbound liquidity which would be absent if I wanted to make a payment to someone.

Great work!. Curious to know how you guys manage channels when there are no funds in the user's wallet? In the technology page it says


But wouldn't you require some funds to initiate the channel creation? Or are these different kinds of channels?

That's the idea, but the concept of such a game on Bitcoin and Lightning is pretty exciting!

We are still figuring out chinks. Should be on main net in a few weeks! Let me know what you think about the platform itself. :)  
The game has been developed by a different individual though.

I have reached out to the game developer to respond to your question. 
But seriously, I didn't downvote you. :/

In a few weeks, hopefully!

Disclaimer: The apps and games are built by independent developers. The Lightning Playground hosts apps &amp; games and will also provide a lightning node for payments in the future.
  
Thanks for trying out the platform and the game!  
We are a marketplace for apps, games and transactions. We built Lightning Playground to make lightning payment processing easier. Focusing on user experience, we hope to remove all barriers for anyone looking to participate in the future of currency exchange.
  
We believe lightning should enable any micro transaction, including apps, games and e-commerce payments.

Thanks for trying out our platform and playing the game! We are excited about lightning payments as well. :)

Thank you for your response! Hope you had fun.
We're allocating free testnet satoshis to your managed wallet to speed up the process of starting the game in this release. You can choose to add funds to your managed wallet through a lightning channel payment as well. See our how to pay page ([ for the instructions on how to do that.

- Our idea is to keep the individual channel sizes smaller so that users withdraw more frequently and hold smaller amounts on the managed wallet. To enable this, we're planning on 0% withdrawal fee for consumers and 0.25% withdrawal fee for merchants. Also thinking that when we grow to a certain number of accounts, we would add in more nodes instead of loading a single one with too many managed wallets and channels.
- We are also planning on enabling payments to our managed merchant wallets even without the customer having an account / managed wallet on the playground. That would be a routed payment through our lightning node. Simply put, we don't want to manage this with a database.
- Our biggest problem has been simplifying the payment process. There's no MetaMask equivalent wallet on the mainnet and we've been wondering how much that is a barrier to entry for customers in the iOS and Mac realm. Would you know of any such solutions out there for people on those platforms?
Please do suggest any alternative solutions if you have something in mind.
