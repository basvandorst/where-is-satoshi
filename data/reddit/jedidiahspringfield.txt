That's fine.  But then understand that there are large sections of economics you don't understand.

Thanks for the links, interesting.

You need to read the rest of your economics 101 textbook.  There are lots of market failures that all economists understand and accept.  Fireworks is the classic example in textbooks.  If I produce a fireworks display and charge people to view it, some people will pay to watch from near by.  But other people will be able to enjoy the free show from further away without paying.  My fireworks display produces a positive externality that I am not compensated for.  As a result, economics tells us that a free market will produce fewer fireworks displays than is optimum for society.
To remedy this, economists suggest that society can "internalize the externality" by taxing the public and subsidizing things that produce positive externalities, like education, fireworks, and healthcare.

Right...and we know that not everyone will choose to use it on day 1.  The thing is, you and I don't have control over everyone.  We can't force them to use SegWit, so it's *their* choice how useful SegWit is, not ours.  In contrast, if core put out a blocksize increase, it would instantly and dramatically increase bandwith.

The issue is externalities.  Consider something like healthcare.  Healthcare is obviously a scarce resource (or more accurately, the labor of medical professionals is a scarce resource).  Society chooses to subsidize that scarce resources to artificially increase its prevalence because we think that healthcare has positive externalizes.  By saving the life of someone who can't afford it, we don't just help them, we help their families and friends and remove an incentive for that person to steal for example.
Many people think that at this very early stage in bitcoin's development, there are positive externalities to low fees - it encourages new users who will be attracted to bitcoin as an alternative to paypal or visa or western union.
Eventually bitcoin itself won't be good for these things, but by then we'll have lightning network or something similar that will be good.  So it might make sense to maintain lower fees for a year until an alternative is ready.  This way we can continue attracting new users and not force people to look for an alternative to bitcoin.

"a child", lol.  Yea, I guess a bunch of the core devs are children.  
People have been using bitcoin as a medium of exchange for 4 years.  Arguably the only reason bitcoin exists today as a major phenomena is because of darknet markets. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:24:40
But it's not just about math and programming.  Arguably the biggest part of the disagreement is over what bitcoin should become.  Should it be a relatively small but wonderfully secure store of wealth?  Or do we instead prioritize it being useful to more people for more use cases, perhaps at the risk of slightly less decentralization? 
There's also a big economic disagreement. Bitcoin companies are saying that core devs don't understand the economics of the bitcoin ecosystem and that their actions are driving away bitcoin users.  Core devs counter that the companies don't understand the technical side and their demands would reduce the security of the ecosystem.  They're largely talking past each other.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:59:58
Core isn't rolling out a throughput increase.  They are planning to roll out a throughput increase in the future.  Hopefully not too many developers, users, and investors will have abandoned bitcoin by then.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:46:27
I'm making the second point, but I don't think it's just semantics.  People are making major decisions *today* to avoid immediate scaling based on a timetable of future releases.  It's important to remember the timeline and that there is a window in which we could face major problems before SegWit and LN are released.  SegWit seems like its at least close to deployment (although delays are always possible).  People are talking about LN like its a foregone conclusion even though most of the code isn't even written yet.  
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:19:21
Your logic suggests that if we increase the number of users, holders, and use cases the number of full nodes may increase, since more people will have the same incentives as you to run a full node - more people will want to validate and to support a robust network out of self-interest since more people will have more wealth in bitcoin.  These are two countervailing forces.  It's not obvious to me which one wins out, but long-term I think the latter.  The most likely non-mining full nodes are businesses.  If bitcoin adoption increased 10x, I think we'd see a lot more businesses created and running full nodes.
We're all dancing around bitcoin's more fundamental problem - the incentive structure encourages centralized mining and relatively few non-mining nodes.  I haven't heard any suggestions to fix that. Keeping blocks small *might* mitigate that problem or might exacerbate it if I'm right that more users could mean more non-mining nodes.  Regardless, it's a fairly marginal issue.  The difference between, say, 3000 and 6000 nodes is probably not in the top 3 threats to bitcoin's centralization.  The decentralization curve is kind of exponential.  From 1 node to 10 is a massive increase in decentralization, same for 10 to 20, 20 to 100, 100 to 1000 etc.  Then you get diminishing returns.  Yes, we want as many full nodes as possible, but I'm far more concerned about concentration in political control of development, and mining secondarily.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:05:44
If you're right, bitcoin has peaked in value.  Market cap is already higher than necessary to support darknet market purchases.  Personally I think you're wrong.  Bitcoin can be useful for many more types of transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:59:20
Segwit hasn't increased anything because Segwit hasn't been released.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:52:26
We knew a year ago that we'd have to raise capacity.  Segwit will be a &lt;10% capacity increase on day 1 (according to core devs) and will only slowly rise to something around 1.7x over several months.
And SegWit hasn't been implemented yet and can't be implemented today, regardless of how much transaction volume increases and how backed up the mempool gets.  
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:03:23
If you study science, you should know that empirical evidence never "proves" anything.  Ever.  You can disprove models but not prove them.  Empirical evidence simply tells us that a model has done a good job at estimating the real world in the past.
Remember that all physics theories are wrong and any decent physicist will admit that.  One after another, we disprove theories, from newtonian gravity to relativity.  Physicists understand that all of their models are just the best approximation they currently have for reality, but that none actually match reality.  They just hope to make better and better approximations over time.
99% of science is not about finding a "correct" answer, but about finding a "useful" answer.  A model that we can use to build a computer or fly an airplane.
@_date: 2016-03-07 04:58:00
Paying to run more nodes is centralizing the network?  What about DDOSing nodes and miners that run Classic?  Or starting a company and hiring and funding core devs and demanding centralized consensus to scale?  Is it centralizing the network for 10 core devs to effectively control bitcoin's development and future?  Or you think 795 hosted nodes reflects more meaningful centralization?
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:13:22
250 GB/month and you're saying you have a fast connection?  Come on.  I have an average comcast connection and upload at 10 Mb **per second.**
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:14:03
I think you're just confused with the grammar.  "rolling out" is present tense.  I said the proper tense is future.  Core **plans to roll out** a throughput increase in April according to the current roadmap.  It'd be similar to if I said, "fees have become $0.20."  No.  That'd be a lie and fear mongering.  Fees *could in the future* become $0.20.  Future and present are different.

Do you constantly shill just for the fun of it?  Do you get paid to repeat frequently debunked nonsense, or do you offer your services for free?
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:00:33
Incorrect.  Core devs say Segwit will produce a &lt;10% bandwith increase on day 1.  Over time it will increase to something in the 1.5x to 2x area, but that will take months.
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:22:20
There are already lots of other ways to transact like that.  Credit cards come to mind.  My credit card isn't connected to a bank account.  I can't lose *anything* to fraud.  I won't even be out the $30 because the credit card company will refund me (and has).  This is not a competitive advantage for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:58:46
Yea, the more people resist bitcoin scaling, the more likely bitcoin will scale.  Wait, what?
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:10:41
You're confusing correlation with causation.  In bitcoin's early history, node count actually increased dramatically with average block size.  That was obviously because of user adoption.  There's no incentive these days to run a non-mining node (besides validation).  So some of us think that more bitcoin users will likely also produce more "angels" who are willing to spend $300 a year supporting a full node out of "altruism" to the bitcoin network.  More bitcoin users also creates more demand for validation, and might increase full node count for that purpose.  Again, we saw this pattern early in bitcoin's history.  
Why did that pattern change?  Because a lot of nodes were run by small miners.  When they could no longer mine economically they stopped running a node.
@_date: 2016-03-09 02:25:02
Are you suggesting that anything underdoing testing is being rolled out?  If not, what makes something being "rolled out" as opposed to "will be rolled out."
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:09:38
Gavin is pushing for changes so bitcoin can support the transactions its users want to make.  We've had full blocks and an overloaded mempool several times in the last 2 weeks.  Why would you "let go" of a glaring and serious and immediate problem that can be super easily resolved?  The vast majority of the bitcoin ecosystem wanted these changes **6 months ago.**  Let it go already with your obstructionism.  Just let it go dude.  Let bitcoin scale and evolve as the vast majority of its users, miners, and companies want it to.  
@_date: 2016-03-09 04:07:39
You've got it backwards.  I said segwit is not yet being rolled out.  bash responded that it is indeed being rolled out as evidenced by the testing.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:17:48
No, that's not how SegWit works.  You seem to honestly not understand the technical side.  SegWit's contribution to the bitcoin network's bandwith depends on *total ecosystem* usage.  If you're the only one who starts using SegWit, it will have zero impact on your ability to transact.  Your fees will not be lowered, and network congestion may produce economic problems for bitcoin companies and users.  In contrast, a 2 MB hard fork immediately increases capacity as long as miners fill some blocks with more than 1 MB worth of transactions.  Considering that a substantial percentage of blocks are over 700k these days, it seems likely that if there were 1.6 MB worth of transactions with equal fees, those same miners would include them.  Miners have also said as much publicly.
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:13:20
Of course.  But much of that can't and won't ever be over darknets.  For example, if someone wants a handjob in a dark alley in a poor part of India, they're probably going to transact in cash.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:30:23
Those multiple transactions are necessary for bitcoin to survive.  Many people want it to be at least pseudo-anonymous if not anonymous.  That currently requires "excessive" transactions.  Those excessive transactions are necessary for many current bitcoin use cases.
And you introduced a false dichotomy.  *no one* is suggesting relying on blocksize to scale.  Just about everyone welcomes segwit and LN, the question is can we include *one small* blocksize increase to buy us time while we wait for other scaling solutions to be ready.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:40:01
If that's true it's news to me.  Source?  
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:12:05
Testing = rolling out?  LN is also being tested, is that currently rolling out as well? I thought you didn't like lying?
@_date: 2016-03-11 00:30:07
I think I understand the issue.  You're viewing this through a purely technical lens and think there is some kind of objectively "best" code.  The truth is that bitcoin has competing economic and political interests.  Some people want bitcoin to change the world; they want it to make the biggest difference for the most people.  Other people prioritize the status quo - they view bitcoin as already successful and want to do everything they can to prevent it from falling below its current state.  Still others want bitcoin to be as much of a "currency" as possible, while others care more about its role as a store of value.  All of these desires require tradeoffs, we can't have it all.
  The blocksize debate is a good example.  There are certainly technical questions there, but we have top technical experts on both sides of the debate.  The bigger disagreement seems to be political and economic.  Small block advocates basically say: the risk of bigger blocks right now is too great; we should scale slowly and carefully to minimize the risk of political instability from a hard fork and technical instability from larger blocks; we're willing to sacrifice some users and usability in the mean time.  Big block advocates basically say: we should accept a small amount of that political and technical risk to avoid losing potential users and/or being rendered obsolete by competing Fintech.  
It's possible for two developers to have identical analysis of the technical risks and and to come to two different conclusions because of how they value those risks.  Do you think of bitcoin like IBM (as in a giant representing huge wealth that we must protect at all costs, and should therefore avoid taking risks)? or as a brand new startup experiment (where we  should aggressively innovate and take risks to give us the best chance of conquering the world)?  
Or let me put it even more succinctly.  Let's say we knew for sure that SegWit and LN would not be ready for 2 years.  Let's say we could hard fork to 4 MB immediately and we all agreed it was technically safe, but might create political havoc that would destroy bitcoin.  Most of the community would welcome the hard fork if the risk of destruction, was, say 0.001%.  And still if the risk was 0.1% and probably still at 1%.  At 50%, everyone would reject that risk, and probably at 25% too.  But at, say, a 5% risk, some people would welcome it, and others would reject it. 
Some of the difference would be based on vision - what do they want and hope bitcoin to be?  Other differences would be based on economics: people with all their net worth in bitcoin who think of themselves as wealthy probably wouldn't want to take that risk.  Other people like myself with 30% of their net worth in bitcoin who view it speculatively would happily take the risk if we though it gave us a much greater chance of realizing large returns.  Similarly, Coinbase might not one to take the risk, because they are somewhat "established", whereas a smaller startup funded by VC money and not yet profitable would happily take the risk because they have lots to gain from bitcoin's growth and less to lose from its failure.
As for Classic, consider this: some core developers have said they will change the PoW algorithm to destroy the miners if a fork to Classic happens.  Imagine you're a miner and have invested your life savings (and taken on debt) to buy mining hardware.  You know that if you support Core, bitcoin might not grow as quickly which might hurt your profits, but things will probably work out okay.  If you support Classic, you could end up on the losing end of a political battle that will bankrupt you.
@_date: 2016-03-09 02:27:09
"Why? Anyone can contribute code to an open source project. Anyone can fork the codebase, just like XT and Classic did."
Kind of.  Nodes and miners that adopted the forks or anyone said they were testing them were DOS attacked.  Censorship means that the community as a whole will often mostly hear one side an argument against non-Core proposals. 
And while anyone can *try* to contribute code, if Core doesn't include it in their releases it won't get implemented.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:09:20
Censorship certainly exists in private venues (in most private venues in fact), it's simply not illegal.  No one is saying we have a 1st amendment right to post whatever we want on reddit.  People are simply complaining that the moderators of the forum attempt to use their power to manipulate public opinion in a way that runs counter to the spirit of bitcoin.  r/btc is no better btw.  
I think you're underestimating the political and economic forces when you talk about open source.  It's a bit like how black people in America  complain that systemic discrimination limits their opportunities.  It's not that "system" explicitly prevents black Americans from succeeding, but it puts all these little obstacles in their way that add up to something significant.  (much less today than, say, 20 years ago).  
People don't simply run "the best code" on their node.  Rather, we are all invested in having bitcoin remain whole and integrated.  We can imagine a very different bitcoin ecosystem where there are constantly new releases every other day.  It would be very confusing to non-technical experts and destabilizing.  Instead, the vast majority of bitcoin developers have decided to use consensus (mostly among themselves) to decide what code goes into the next Core release.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:12:03
Indeed.  So more bitcoin users will likely produce more full nodes.  We should encourage more users.
The opposite trend has been happening in the last few years as mining nodes can no longer mine economically and stop running full nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-07 04:42:17
Or maybe they just want redundancy because the anti-classic folk keep DDOSing nodes that adopt classic?
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:56:34
Definitely.  Why can't these morons just let the mempool congest, transactions fall off the network, and fee pricing start eliminating use cases for bitcoin before any alternative is available?  
Maybe we need to DDOS more of their nodes and miners to to make them understand that blocktards don't control bitcoin, we do.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:03:43
I just corrected your misreading of my statement...  
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:25:43
But you weren't sticking with science.  You were making economic arguments.  
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:54:55
This is like saying that as a company grows, buying more servers is just kicking the can down the road.  It's nonsensical.  Scaling by definition is an ongoing process.  You scale in an ongoing way as volume increases.  That's what scaling means.  
Now, some software improvements (like LN) may represent sharper increases in scaling and may do so more efficiently.  And those will be awesome if and when they arrive.  But they aren't ready to be implemented yet, so holding off on other scaling methods that *are* ready because they're "kicking the can down the road" is literally nonsensical because they're not alternatives, they're complimentary.  Adding 1 new server today doesn't mean you can't add a 2nd server tomorrow.  In 3 days you'll need both new servers...
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:02:07
Yea, bitcoin definitely being manipulated by the reddit censorship, development centralization, and DDOS attacks.  
And yes, it's definitely about protocol control.  Those who control it are desperate to maintain control.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:47:30
Which part is false?  Are you claiming that SegWit has already been implemented?  Or are you saying you disagree with my "hope" and think that lots of people will abandon bitcoin?  I doubt you would say the latter.
