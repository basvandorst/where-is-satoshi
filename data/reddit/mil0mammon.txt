I think we're all to an extent guilty of indulging in our echo chambers. I'm willing to change my position if presented with credible evidence. However, I'm doubtful of the impartiality of an anti-nuclear activist. 
A case can be made against old school nuclear plants. Ideally we would be building next gen (pebble bed iirc) plants to recycle the waste of the old plants, and turn of old ones when optimal. It's activist like these that make this a whole lot harder than it should be. 
Do you have other sources for your points of view?

To seriously start mining btc you need to invest as it is. Wouldn't this invest be similar with proof of stake, just split up between the stake and the hw?

This I know, but buying a Moto G for that purpose seems highly inefficient.

There's a map? Why can't I see this on mobile? There's also no 'desktop version' option..

Do you really feel threatened by fukushima/global warming? How? Also Nuclear warfare seems pretty unlikely. So yes, in the first world, we're pretty much living in the safest time ever.

It wasn't meant as mudslinging. I was just wondering how the tipbot translated '1 beer' to $3,64.

Ah, damn, so many fears in one comment. I believe it's questionable that rough weather now is caused by global warming. Also, look up wether such stuff is really happening more. I thought it just seems more due to various reasons. 
I am worried about the 'police state-ing' of various nations, I hope this trend will be reverted. (and that seems to be happening, albeit it slowly)  
IIRC Fukushima isn't worse than Chernobyl by a long shot, and what damage did that do to the rest of the world? People in Europe couldn't eat certain vegetables for a while. Oh my. 
Is there really evidence for increasing corruption in the first world? Or is this just a vague distrust of politicians? Not that that is totally unwarranted, but of all ages. 
The financial sector seems to be recovering finally, and the previous crisis was largely caused by them feeling too safe and thus taking too many risks. I hope they've learned their lesson. 
Peak oil seems to get further and further away - in part because, thanks to global warming (which *is* a serious issue, but that isn't due to current rough weather) green is trend again, as it should be. More focus here is welcome, my estimate is that that will happen in the coming period, as we fully get out of the economic crisis. 
Summarising: there are things to be worried about, things that need to change and things that are just not right. But not really anything to feel threatened by.

So what happens if you give a phone to charity? How does that work?

So how come one beer is $3,64? Seems both random and a bit high

Bacon reader, use it.

Al it takes is 1 bitcoin ATM in a big city. All the people in the city will be able to use it, and with 20M people, enough will do this to make the ATM viable. This then could spread to other cities.
Theoretically they could even work from internet cafes until they can afford their own computer. It's good to be sceptical, but occasionally it helps to think in possibilities instead of problems.
