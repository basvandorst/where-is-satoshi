Their first machine was Robocoin, but otherwise BitAccess. 
They do a really good job at supporting the machines and customers, so machine hardware aside CoinCloud is a great operator for a location to partner with.

More contacts: 
The BitAccess BTM is owned by Zenbox. The fee and limits will vary based on availability, but they'll be able to share those ahead of time if needed. They can be reached by email: support
For any other questions with the BTM, you can also reach out to us (BitAcceess) directly. I can't tell you if the store is open, but I can check to make sure the BTM is online and functional, stock levels etc. Handy if you're just on your way since this location does seem to get unplugged from time to time. Phone: (844) 248-2223 or email support 
There is indeed also a Lamassu there, owned by a different company. Not sure how the rates compare, but they do operate side by side.

Sorry to hear you had problems with the Yorkdale BTM! If you ever encounter a problem with a BitAccess BTM, feel free to give us (BitAccess) a call directly: (844) 248-2223. I'm personally on call seven days a week, so we take calls anytime.

For anyone looking for these machines, it's worth noting they'll be found at the Gateways Newstand or Xpress within their respective malls. Most are close to the counter and should be easy to spot once you find the store, they're all red and white as pictured. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 02:01:22
All locations except Vancouver and Calgary are live and usable today. Ottawa was installed last week and the GTA locations [were installed yesterday](

Depends on where you're located, really. If you're just selling a small-ish amount as a personal transaction it's probably not something you need to worry about, but if you're looking to do it as a business (which it sounds like you are), a lawyer should be the first person you talk to. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:21:45
On the contrary, they're fully KYC compliant and can be customized as needed to comply with local regulation. Phone verification, ID verification and face scan is available as required. The only thing we don't have is the palm scanning "feature", which isn't actually needed for KYC purposes. 
Most of our machines are located in jurisdictions that don't require all the KYC functionality to be enabled, but it is an option for the operator. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:00:55
If you're just curious as to the process, I can explain that.
It'll ask for your phone number and send an SMS as an identity check. Then you select sell, enter in the amount you'd like to sell and it'll generate a QR code valid for a few minutes. You send the bitcoins and it may process immediately, or else you may need to wait for a small number of confirmations. If the latter is the case, then you're free to leave the BTM and shop; it'll send an SMS when it's ready and using your same phone number you can retrieve the cash anytime you like.
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:53:43
An impressive list of designs; I think that's every single one of our machines that's wrapped, with our one-off prototype thrown in for good measure. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:59:37
No problem at all. :)
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:38:32
If I may, we're pretty easy to get a hold of. :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:53:23
OP didn't call us unfortunately, I learned of this through Reddit. Cavirtex should generally be the first contact for issues, but we can often fix issues within minutes should something arise. 
We're on call all day every day if something goes wrong with a BitAccess BTM: (844) 248-2223. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:09:06
Because of the varying laws &amp; regulations in the US, no ATM manufacturer is really going to be able to give you great advice on what's required in your state. If you're serious at looking at an ATM, I'd recommend consulting a local lawyer and communicating your requirements to ATM manufacturers to figure out what will work for your area.
I'm not in sales and I'm not here to sell you on a machine, but I do work with BTMs all day. If you have any questions feel free to reach out - whether it's about our machines or someone else's. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:14:16
Nope, not ours. If it was small and orange it'll have likely been a General Bytes. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:56:47
Sell is still disabled for the time being. Not sure when they plan to enable it, but "buy, sell and accept Bitcoin" is printed on literally every machine. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:27:41
The Bitcoins are actually (should be) sent from the BTM instantly; we just say an hour so that I don't get calls when people's wallets/sites force them to wait for 1-3 confirmations to actually use the funds. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:09:09
 is always very up-to-date. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:12:26
Brookfield Place is still installed (as far as I know). 
There was one that was relocated at the last minute when they were first installed, it didn't physically fit in the originally planned store. And the Niagara Falls BTM was moved to London, ON after a month or two. But otherwise the BTMs remain unmoved since their announcement. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:31:22
An API is on our roadmap, so that should definitely help things. For the moment I just check your site manually, so that's where it would be nice. But you're right, I don't see a single duplicate taking a look through; you even caught the Cavirtex machine move (Niagara to London), it seems, so looks good to me. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:56:06
The top camera is only used during the ID verification process, if enabled, to take a picture to compare to the ID. It is otherwise disabled and does not take pictures or video at any other part of the process. The only time either camera is enabled is when it's displaying the picture on the screen, so no need to worry there. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:26:50
This location is a BitAccess BTM, so there's no palm scanner. When you look at the article proper it has a picture of the actual installation, it's not the one in the thumbnail. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:47:58
Indeed, there is one at the Greyhound station; nice find. The BTM that was supposed to go to Fairview Mall was relocated to the Greyhound station at the last minute, so it didn't make it into the press release. And they are all currently set to be buy-only, though all are two-way machines. Sell can be enabled at a later date.
The locations that are live, if anyone's curious:
* Yonge St. and St. Clair Ave. (15 St Clair Ave E) - Toronto  
* Greyhound Bus Terminal (610 Bay St.) - Toronto  
* Brookfield Place - Toronto  
* Yorkdale Shopping Centre - Toronto  
* Scarborough Town Centre - Scarborough  
* Square One Mississauga - Mississauga  
* Casino Niagara - Niagara Falls  
* Bayshore Shopping Centre - Ottawa
Worth noting for anyone that must sell immediately, there is another BitAccess BTM at [Bitcoin Decentral]( (64 Spadina Ave.) that does have sell enabled. It was originally a one-way location (the first machine we installed in Canada) but has since been replaced with a two-way BTM. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:12:43
Most of the machines in Canada actually don't require an ID scan or fingerprint (or equivalent); BTMs can sell up to $3,000 a day with just a phone number. There are a few that may have palm scanning (made by a specific manufacturer), but that's above and beyond what is required.
In the US, for most installations you'll definitely need at least a government issued photo ID.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:00:52
The ATM located at Bitcoin Decentral is different than the one at Snakes and Lattes, but it's currently charging 0% fees on buy transactions (using a Canadian exchange). 
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:54:57
Coming soon. Look for an announcement in the coming days. 
Location  is 4055 Rue Saint-Catherine ouest, Suite 194 for anyone that's curious. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:59:33
From my point of view, you're doing a great job, keep it up! You consistently find the new machines going out as soon as there's even the slightest mention, and once or twice before the BTM even arrives at the location. It's fun to see how fast you can catch the new ones. :)
One thing I'd love to see is a more condensed view of the [manufacturer pages]( or at least a way to show more than 5 per page. The number of machines is growing fast enough that trying to check to see if something is duplicated or missing is a bit of a challenge. I think that's probably something that few people care about though.
You could also look at making similar pages for major cities/areas; listing all the locations in Toronto, for example. That's not something I'd really need to use, but I could see that being useful to the average user. As we start seeing 10+ in a single area, it'd make it easier to see the different locations and it'd probably also help a ton with search engine traffic.
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:21:43
There are seven BitAccess BTMs, plus a Skyhook, a Lamassu and a Robocoin (last I checked). 
Here's my handy-dandy list of BitAccess locations:
* Scarborough Town Centre
* Yonge St. and St. Clair Ave.
* Greyhound Bus Terminal
* Brookfield Place
* Square One Mississauga
* Yorkdale Shopping Centre
* Bitcoin Decentral (64 Spadina Ave)
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:34:58
[CoinATMRadar]( will show you what's local and, if supported, can display current rates. Not all manufacturers have an API for sharing the realtime prices (we don't, for example), but they do show rates for some locations. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:14:01
The Flexepin vouchers we're using for this aren't available internationally, so this service is exclusive to Canada. For the US and other countries, our BTMs remain widely available and a great option to buy Bitcoin in cities where they're located. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:57:37
Fair point! We'll look at making that clearer. For the moment, if you start the transaction process you can see the $/BTC rate before needing to enter a Flexepin voucher; you can just cancel out after that. The rate is currently ~2% over market price.
Edit: The retailer will also charge a fee when selling a Flexepin voucher, which varies from $1.49 to $7.95 depending on the amount. That's just the cost of the voucher, but is indeed also something worth mentioning and being clearer about. It'll be added to the site.
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:03:56
Fortunately did reach out to us and the transaction has now been sent, no need to travel back to the BTM. 
Most locations worldwide ought to have contact info posted for the local operator, but we can always help too. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:37:54
OP doesn't own this machine, but might be able to answer some of your questions.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:30:31
Scanning the address comes before inserting cash, but yep, it's pretty simple; the BTM will walk you through it. 
[The entire transaction process can be seen in video form]( [1:24] since that's probably the easiest way to explain it. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:20:43
This machine is currently offline, but the Lamassu beside it (in the same store) ought to be working provided it's not out of stock. The BitAccess machine ought to be back soon. 
A new machine was just installed in Sunnyvale that no one has mentioned yet. A little bit farther to go than something within the city, but it's a relatively short drive or possible to reach via Caltrain. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:30:16
If you're interested in owning a BitAccess BTM, just send us an email: sales 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:22:53
Not there anymore unfortunately, it was a Robocoin. It seems to have been removed instead of converting it to a different platform. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:32:12
As far as functions go, you can both buy and sell Bitcoin with this BTM. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:29:09
The BTM from Workshop Cafe actually moved to Nakamoto's, so it's the same machine. It is installed and working, provided the store is open.
They also have a one-way Lamassu installed there, last I saw. So there should be two options. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:38:26
It can certainly be wrapped up in there, but it was admittedly an afterthought for us too. :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:53:54
Not entirely the same thing though, this appears to *just* be for support whereas our machines have actual ongoing costs (OP/SMS/ID scans). Its a different model, the support really isn't the reason for ours. 
That said $100 a month for support seems perfectly reasonable for just support and a flat fee certainly has its benefits. For normal machines, this news shouldn't be a problem at all. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:28:57
This is actually the same BTM, just in a new location. They just removed the sticker.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:40:42
A lot of locations are run by one or two person companies that are managing other projects too, so having someone on call 24/7 even by phone isn't really feasible in most cases. Some will have phone numbers, but you'll find they'll primarily go to voicemail where the owner can call you back later on their own time. Almost all should at least have an email or website with a contact form, which is then effectively the same thing. 
When we start seeing companies operating 100+ machines, it'll make sense to have on-call support staff, logistics networks, etc., but when operating one or two machines it's just too hard to do.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:22:45
It had some internet issues at one point I think, but it's been online consistently lately. It's online and working just fine right now. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:11:23
She was [given a Genesis unit]( but I don't know that it was ever installed. I would assume this might be a different group. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:45:53
It's in the works. :) 
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:49:12
This was filmed last summer, before the Cavirtex BTMs launched.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:07:09
It'll vary a little depending on the model, but this shows the process on a BitAccess BTM if you don't mind a video: 
In short, the BTM does display a QR code and ask you to send a specific amount to it. It watches for it on the blockchain and it will either pay out immediately or wait for confirmations, depending on operator set dollar &amp; confirmation thresholds (confirmations can be up to 3, but are almost always 1). If it can't pay out immediately you don't have to stand there and wait, it'll send you an SMS when you're able to withdraw and you can come back any time (5 minutes later or a week later, no matter). 
If you send the wrong amount or it doesn't appear on the blockchain in time (5 minute window) then the BTM will refund you the Bitcoin and ask you to try again. To receive the refund, you'll need to return to the BTM and scan your wallet address QR code; it doesn't need to be the original address.
Always be sure to include a fee when sending to the BTM and for best results, use a "traditional" wallet rather than sending directly from an exchange, Coinbase or Circle. 
No Bitcoin ATM supports NFC and I think there's only one type that supports sweeping paper wallets, but that's not a very good idea (giving the unit your private key...). You'll need an internet-connected mobile device with a camera and bitcoin wallet software installed (eg. cellphone) to sell otherwise.
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:30:18
Thanks for posting this! called us shortly thereafter and the transaction has been resolved.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:58:10
All of the Cavirtex BTMs were actually removed at the beginning of January, [BitSent is taking over the machines]( They'll be re-branded and reinstalled soon, although some locations may change.
