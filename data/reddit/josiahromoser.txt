Thanks, do you have a link to one? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:17:28
I can't see the comment you responded to, but I use Chase and they charge crypto currency transactions as Cash Advances, and charge the appropriate fees for them. Its fraud in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:06
EDIT: Just to add, I used dynamic fee settings and slid the little fee bar all the way to the right (which I believe should have allotted for higher fees/faster confirmation - but I guess not) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:10
Is there a way to just cancel the transaction all together? And get my original payment + my fees back? 
I think I'd prefer to just start the whole process over.

I have no idea why im getting down voted..

Can I pay more fees to get it moving? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:33:12
Thanks, I'm completely new to using Bitcoin as I mainly use other coins for transactions. I've never done a Replace by Fee - how would I go about doing that? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:02
Since I don't have access to the wallet where I am now - would it be possible to download electrum here, input the seed from the other wallet, and pay for a higher fee?

I have no clue how to interpret the info presented on blockchair when I look up a tx haha

Ok so I have the wallet rebuilt on my current computer and I can see the transaction - when I right click the unconfirmed transaction it gives me the following options: 
Copy Date
Child pays for parent (wtf haha)
View on block explorer
I don't see anything about increasing fees
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:23
I'm at work and I don't have access to the wallet at the moment. I really appreciate the help though. I was hoping I could do something through a browser. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:02
I plan on emptying the wallet and starting fresh anyway. Look for a PM from me :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:29
Just curious - does this ever work? Have you found anyone thats so unaware that they actually give you their private keys?

Should I copy and paste the article into a reddit post then? 
I've never been told that a link to an article isn't sufficient, but I'm happy to oblige. I didn't write the article. Just thought it was a good read.

Good call - Everybody put on the horse blinders! Don't want to get spooked by a free market. Bread Wallet is rated NC-17, where the raging moms be at? Censor the world around you to appeal to your own desires. I'm in! 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:09:08
I did post it on reddit, you commented on the post..

I'm not worried about scaling on-chain with BCH. There's solutions that exist using today's tech that can run [1TB blocks](
And actually, the data is stored on the blockchain. Not off-chain. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:45:36
Well we can't justify it simply by saying "they did it first". An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:57:00
To each his/her own I guess :) 
I prefer it to the possibility of censorship. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:35:41
Great part is that its on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain so space isn't a concern :) 
Also - Memo.cash memo's can be found on the BCH block explorer, no need for the site! Making it an uncensored social network.

There are over 1500 nodes that verify the transactions. I'm not personally running a node as there's no point. 


Relying on third parties to store the data defeats the purpose of the blockchain. The design is intentional due to the benefits the blockchain offers over 3rd party trust. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:36:26


Not quite. SPV wallets are still reading the blockchain data, the verification is done by the network. Someone running a BTC node with no hashpower has the same power, to simply read, except they actually slow down the network. 
SPV allows you to read the headers without intercepting transactions on the network.
Its funny you call it a scheme, this is how Bitcoin BTC worked for years. Its only recently that the mantra of "run your own node for protection" came about. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:44:30
I'd imagine because it works great on BCH and maidsafe is still in alpha. Not sure though.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:43:24
Nope. Its simply a transaction on the blockchain that carries a tiny amount of data. Data that can be read by BCH block explorers. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:48:59
Why do all Bitcoin Cash supporters get lumped into "they"? 
A little bit of an over generalization I think.
