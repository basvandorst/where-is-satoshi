You're inexorably driven.

Yup. I have bin and non-bin versions installed at the same time, too. Usually because I'll install the bin version first to get up and running on a green box until the non-bin version is built. Although if the system has little enough RAM, I won't do the non-bin route at all...

What's sad here is the implication that you don't feel sorry about personal attacks *otherwise*.

Not true. There's libreoffice-bin, thunderbird-bin, firefox-bin and chromium-bin. You'll notice a pattern, though...the non-bin versions of those packages take an inexorable amount of time to build.

I'm not a fanatical athiest (actually getting baptized Episcopalian next month.), and I've known the guy for almost a decade.
He's honest, polite and always well-meaning. I've seen him as an effective, respected and respectable community manager on some pretty raunchy IRC channels; the trope "reasonable authority figure" comes to mind. But on religion? He's out there.

Virtually *no* package in Gentoo (or any other distro) is identical to upstream, both because of the work that goes into integrating with the rest of the system (i.e. compatibility fixes that upstream won't accept), *and* because of individual maintainer preferences. I know people who run with USE="-\*" in their make.conf because they don't want to trust *anybody's* defaults. So, yeah, it's pretty easy to assert that people had to opt-in. You *don't run* Gentoo without some intent of being aware of these things. Gentoo != ( Ubuntu | Fedora | Arch ).
A question over whether or not a USE flag is on by default? That's a pretty normal dispute within Gentoo. And it always comes down to "well, if you don't like it, why don't you step up and maintain it?" There's *always* a general shortage of maintainers in Gentoo. And any other distro, for that matter.
Regardless, he [apologized]( and even set the ljr use flag to off-by-default.

If he was a sneaky bastard, that USE flag wouldn't be there...
