yes, use coinomi, you won't get a lot for it, but it is free money
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:55:00
I'm confused, did you dump the coins or not? Title pic says you did, but comment above says you didn't. Which is it?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:58:27
Depressing but true.

if they have one of your private keys and can get your master public key, they can get all your private keys from your wallet

10:1 for diamond, 1 BTC = 10 BCD

They'll call you at a random time to verify information to OK the withdrawal.

But which five did you dump? I've dumped bcash, bgold, bitcore and super bitcoin, but I'm not aware of a fifth one.

Taking a crypto dump feels good, almost like the real thing.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:21:33
Yes, that is correct.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:09:48
check coinmarketcap, its 2 BTC for 1 bitcore

use Coinomi to sweep the address to harvest the coin, then send to exchange to cash in
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:16:40
Bitcore is just another shitcoin. You won't get a lot for it, but it is still free money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:16:53
OK. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:18:22
these are three shitcoins created as forks from bitcoin, so anyone with bitcoin (not on exchange) from before the fork has all these shitcoins too, they irrationally have a market value, so you can take advantage of this by selling them, the revenue you receive is essentially free money provided by some idiot who wants to give away their money
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:39:02
yes, i got to dump bcash, bgold, bitcore with Coinomi, free money, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:20:17
no other coins i am aware of now, i am sure you could use other wallets to dump the shitcoins, but i found Coinomi to be very easy
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:30:57
absolutely take that precaution
