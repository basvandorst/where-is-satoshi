Wuuuut. This physical bitcoin is still bitcoin, it's backed by bitcoin so it isn't fiat. The company would not be a Government, it would be a transparent not for profit organisation. Much like how SSL encryption is run through 'trusted' third parties. You're missing the point that these paper coins could then be traded between indaviduals in the third world without electricity or internet access. 
Don't list the benefits of bitcoin to me, I obviously know the benefits of bitcoin and I am not trying to discredit it at all.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:07:47
Omg, I know I'm selling!!
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:08:14
It would also be incredibly easy for the company to ban bitcoin nodes from being run on their servers.

One bitcoin day is accumulated by storing 1 bitcoin for a day. Moving this bitcoin will destroy the number of bitcoin days since it was last moved or created. It is used in the blockchain to figure out how far back a miner has to look to verify the transaction. As you can see, The largest number of bitcoin days to ever be destroyed were destroyed last week, it is an indicator that a very large whale is moving their coins around. The second largest amount of bitcoin days were destroyed around the time of the last major crash

Find an excuse to leave your home, all your family and everything you know just so you can buy some magical internet money?
If you were that desperate and they actually banned it, couldn't you just use a VPN or something?

Check the tickers mate. I'm just letting people know. I never said we'd see panic selling but it's been down for nearly 30 minutes now.

I can confirm the legitimacy of this email, my sister lives in Japan, she called me this morning to inform me that she lost her job as a verifier at Mtgox.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:33:39
Reading about the context, it also sounded a lot like entrapment.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:17:50
Yes agreed but with this many bitcoin days destroyed recently, it wont be long until whoever has this huge volume of coins does decide to make their move.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:27:13
Yeah but someone managed to. Who says it wasn't Mrs OP
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:22:54
Check the ticker. It's definitely down
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:28:05
Point taken, the thing is that complaining isn't doing nothing. If enough people complain, maybe they will one day overthrow their government and get their freedom. Whatever that is.
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:45:24
The failure of the occupy wallstreet is a different matter. The problem is that they had no ultimate goal to strive for. They just aimed to reduce wealth inequality, but they never had a target or plan on how they'd do it. Obviously doing things will have a bigger impact than complaining, but complaining might lead to other people doing things. Hence it is still better to complain than do nothing.

Is the noise really not an issue when you're inside? my old BFL 60 GH/s I think it was miner made so much noise I couldn't sleep and had to put it in my shed.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:13:31
Agreed, must be early adopter who's finally seen the future of gox and wants to secure profits. Possibly the Winklevoss brother IMO.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:40:47
Is this a recent development? My brother travels to China regularly and seems to be able to get onto Facebook/youtube just fine using freeware VPNs. He's not exactly a computer genius either.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:13:04
I wish I found out about Chris Odom earlier! This stuff truly is groundbreaking. It's the future of how everyone will store and communicate wealth. the Bitcoin community really needs to learn about the potential of this stuff.

How does GreenAddress not have access to user funds? Do you utilise 2FA?
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:04:54
Oh cool, a time locked transaction! I've never heard of that before. How long do you plan on locking the third key for? I imagine 20 years would be annoyingly long but shorter periods might get tricky with people removing funds without you wanting them to. So two of three keys are required to move the funds. Are you going to release the source code for the time lock so that people smarter than myself can prove if it is unfalsifiable?
And do you think you offer any advantages over the voting pool proposals for holding bitcoins in open transactions?
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:59:34
Haha, have an up vote. It's more because I'm drunk. I wrote this in the odd chance that the sheep of would listen to it and start selling their coins.
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:32:05
Not so much Bitcoin but I think that the concept of a blockchain could one day be an incredibly powerful political tool. Imagine a time where the whole of politics would be run by a blockchain, the ultimate democracy. People would vote for leaders, run for parliament, vote on bills all on a blockchain. Everything the government does would be forever visible in a public ledger, no longer would we have to trust our leaders to do the right thing. 
If we don't like what a party in power is doing, we could vote them out today. Better not, we would not even need political parties, just good ideas that would spread amongst people. The concept of a blockchain is the ultimate communication tool. 
I do not think this will happen anytime soon, but maybe in the next hundred years or so, this is how our world will be run.

It's exactly like Cyanogen but with a few less features.
@_date: 2014-01-24 07:59:11
This is not completely true. A third party company could create paper notes with the private key hidden within, requiring the user to destroy a seal on the paper bitcoin to access the key. Now the user would only have to trust the company that created the paper wallet and the legitimacy of the wallet. These paper wallets could be traded between people for the value of bitcoin, without ever having to be 'opened' and transferred to virtual bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:27:32
Please explain why? I'm getting worried. Tempted to take the coins in my brain wallet out of cold storage and sell them on gox. Help please.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:10:06
^^^ Can confirm
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:30:03
Litre is French for give me my fuckin' cola before I break VOUS FUCKING LIP!
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:06:53
Yeah, It's a kind of strange mix. Nevertheless, I'd love it if they had 1 litre bottles in Australia, that sounds perfect for my personal consumption.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:27:51
Mtgox Australia, mainly.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:36:52
I know they sell 1.25 litre bottles here, that's what I presumed they sold that size all over the world. My family can just share a 1.25 litre bottle at dinner time. That wouldn't be the case for a 1 litre.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:26:23
says gold is worth $6,389,662,288,144 
Divide that by 22 million you find out that if bitcoin hit parity with gold today, one bitcoin would have to be worth $290 439.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:31:25
They sell 1 L cokes in America? That seems like such an awkward size. Is it marketed for personal consumption or sharing?
Edit: GERMANY
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:58:06
The commission is 0.6%. I've never put money into it before because all my funds come from some mining I was doing a little while ago but It's pretty quick to transfer to an Australian bank account. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:43:27
They wouldn't even have to though. Most websites probably give the NSA a backdoor right in. Maybe even... REDDIT
Edit: That was a joke
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:47:17
Ahhh sorry, I should have looked at the URL. Everyone on this sub seems to be from America and all the comments seemed to know so much about this pizza service so I guess I presumed it was American.
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:56:24
Yeah but these alternative crypto currencies need to exist. What if there is an unseen fundamental flaw in the design of bitcoin and the whole network gets taken down tomorrow? We need competition to maintain redundancy. Unless that day ever occurs, I don't see people taking any other alt coins seriously which is just the way it should be.
