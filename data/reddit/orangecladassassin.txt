The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.

sorry, I wasn't clear and edited my post. I lost my .3 bitcoins in mtgox when they took the money and ran.
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:51:39
Well, I signed up because of the free bitcoin promotion, but apparently my college didn't qualify
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:20:04
You should definitely send a letter to him. There is also a contact form for him on his law firms website. It may be worth a shot, though the likelihood of actually hearing a response through this method would be slim, I would try it anyway considering the amount of bitcoin involved.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:45:23
Bummer, tried signing up but no $10 - guess my school doesn't qualify
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:40:58
This is one of the concerns I have. Considering the largest bitcoin exchange was able to cut and run, couldn't others do the same?
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:22:39
I didn't keep them permanently stored in mtgox, I deposited them with the intention to withdraw some. Turns out they let me deposit, but not withdraw. So I was F'ed
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:05:52
I realize it's just a drop in the bucket, but if I got back my .6 bitcoin, I'd be so happy. But that's never gonna happen
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:32
Pretty awesome! It is pretty remarkable how easy it is.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:25:21
I waited a good few hours.
I transfered from my bitfloor to my multibit wallet, I don't recall seeing an option for fees.
Anyway under tools &gt; Reset Blockchain and transactions. I couldn't imagine that it would just delete my bitcoins completely.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:14:56
People should just leave this guy alone. If he decided to give out anymore BTC, he will.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:30:35
Should you really be chastising the people giving advice?
The people who blindly take advice are more at fault. Anyone who sees this as a get rich quick scheme will probably lose money.
I've only become interested in bitcoin the last few days. I only put what I am comfortably willing to lose into an account to buy bitcoin, and I am watching the market and waiting. I will blame only myself if my money is lost, but again, I'm willing to risk it.
If you're taking out loans to buy bitcoins, you're an idiot. Maybe it'll work out, maybe it won't, but as far as I'm concerned you're an idiot.
I compare this to the casino, with better odds and a lower payout. When I go to Atlantic City I say "I have $300 I'm willing to lose, the second I designate this money for gambling, I consider it lost"
I would never ever risk more than I am comfortable with, or than I could afford and neither should anyone else.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:07:48
I think everyone here already knows about this guy :P
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:38:19
Good to hear my BTC won't be getting deleted. How to a pay a fee to speed up the verification?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:06:24
Now let's just get out of the defaults and all will be right in the world.

It really is depressing to see in a way. People so greedy that they borrow money, only to immediately halve their money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:03:19
I feel bad for this guy, simply because he's probably gotten a million messages from people begging for bitcoins, though in all likelihood it was just a throw-away account he'll never use again.
He was a mysterious stranger bestowing wealth upon a lucky few

I have a better offer. I have a bridge I can sell you. Think of the possibilities!

What caused the $500 price jump recently? It's a relatively new, and extremely volatile market
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:56:12
A few months ago, when bitcoins were really cheap, I came ridiculously close to buying in a bunch, but decided against it. Of course I'm kicking myself now. If the price ends up dropping, I'll likely buy in to some, but as a relatively broke college student, my funds are pretty limited.
Honestly though, I hope that most of the people who profited off this bitcoin boom weren't millionaires getting richer, but people getting a break. I love reading about the broke people who were able to pay off debts with their bitcoin investments.
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:41:20
I think one of the major reasons it's as popular on reddit as it is, is to promote bitcoin. Encourage good conversation and reward it with an awesome new currency. It helps spread the good word about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:58:25
Oh, don't get me wrong. I think that a volatile market like this should be treated as a gamble. I think many on this subreddit saw it as a "sure thing".
I think it's insane for people to have taken out loans to buy bitcoins, but there are those who did. They risked more they could afford. I will continue to mess around with BTC likely no matter what happens.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:40:58
If someone just make a few million dollars on what was potentially a few hundred originally I doubt they'll mind paying taxes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:24:03
Decent comparison. When I worked in computer sales, there were people who always had the mentality "Well, the next version will be better and it'll come out in another year."
These are the people who perpetually wait, without ever getting anything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:42:03
For me, it was depositing to Bitfloor. Set a deposit amount and go to your local Bank of America
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:42:27
Well if you have a AAA membership, wouldn't it get charged to a credit card linked to your account? I'm not sure how AAA works, I don't have it.
I know here in NY, there are little "H.E.L.P" trucks that cruise around and will give you a gallon of gas for free if you run out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:11:55
If I was I'd troll the shit out of people by giving them an insignificant amount of BTC. They'd see the name and assume they were getting a huge amount, but nope!
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:26:09
I don't think I did and fees. I didn't see an option for that, or what the method would be to do that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:48:08
Some people might, but there are plenty here who risk losing a lot of money. The last thing they want to see is some douche skip off into the sunset with a ton of stolen money.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:46:31
Ah, could explain the sudden drop from $900 to $650 in like a minute
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:48:25
Yep, that's exactly what I did. Went to the bank and deposited some spare cash (what little I could afford). I figured the market is gonna go bananas tomorrow when mtgox opens again. 
I'll be excited when my wallet isn't reading 0 BTC!
edit: forgot to mention, the money was literally in my bitfloor account by the time I got back from the bank.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:08:30
It will drop, maybe not immediately when the exchange opens, but people are going to get out while they can. The price will likely plummet, my guess is to less than $20 BTC, but who knows. Eventually, when the price drops enough, people will begin buying in, the price will stabilize and slowly begin to climb again, though we won't see the same kind of crazy climb we did the last few months.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:48:09
I'm really aggravated how difficult it is to deposit money to buy bitcoins. I signed up for several sites today hoping that at least one would allow me to instantly transfer money from my bank account.
I'd love to buy into so bitcoins right now, but I've gotta wait for these damn 2-3 day verifications.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:05:14
Yea, hardly a crash. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and is volatile. Over the next few months or years, we're gonna see the Bitcoin value bounce up and down.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:16
Yea, I suppose. I just hate to see people lose so much money, especially when they can't afford to. Of course, they didn't have the money to risk in the first place, so they have only themselves to blame.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:17:37
I really is remarkably hard to buy bitcoins to begin with. Considering you have to sign up for multiple sites, wait for bank verification, transfer to some third party site, then to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:50:05
Why buy something at a 50% discount when it's going to drop to 75%?
I'm not saying that the value will drop any further, but I would at least like the market to stabilize.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:43:56
I'm just speculating. I coordinated DDOS attack on multiple BTC exchanges at the same time enormous bitcoin transfers are being made to the same wallet, seems a tad fishy.
I very well may be wrong, but who knows. We'll see what the market looks like when the dust clears. I'm not rooting against BTC, I would like to start getting involved, but if this is what the market is vulnerable to, it's pretty scary.
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:37:01
I doubt that anyone on here deserves the money, but if some dude wants to make it rain, who are you to judge?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:31:46
IDK how someone drives around without their wallet. Can they really be that far from home?
Best bet is for them to call a friend or push their car to the cash station and scrounge a few bucks. If I was in that situations, bitcoins would be the furthest thing from my mind.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:39:11
What wrong people?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:21:03
I can't imagine. This seems like someone stealing thousands upon thousands of bitcoins. The market is about to get flooded by these guys cash out. 
Value will plummet. Confidence may not return.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:03:10
Why would you buy a dog? There a tons in shelters that risk getting put to sleep if not adopted.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:09:51
Well, you could cash out to what you originally put in. And just let the rest ride. Hell, double what you put in and let the rest stay.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:03
I am not an economist, nor have I ever dealt in the buying in trading of this kind of thing before. In my opinion, the value will likely plummet, with people trying to get whatever they can before they lose it all. The market will stabilize at a lower number, saying 15-20 BTC and then slowly begin to climb. Once it stabilizes, people will feel more confident in the currency again and being to buy in.
The value will begin to climb and then either 1 of two things will happen, there will be another large sell-off with people fearing a repeat of this bubble and another "crash" will occur, OR, there will be a small sell-off followed by a quick stabilization and rise.
I'm going to buy into BTC tonight when MtGox opens again. Buy in cheap as I foresee the value rising again, though likely not to the same values as before.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:16:32
We are about to see the price drop, like, tremendously when these exchanges recover from these DDOS. Like, set the currency back years in value. I bought in $40 worth earlier, but oh well. I spend that much on shitty video games every few weeks, so NBD.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:45:41
So theoretically, the "1%" of bitcoin owners that own a fair amount of bitcoins could continuously increase the amount of bitcoins they have without investing anymore money?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:13:58
It's hard to say. I do foresee the price rising again, but first the market will have to stabilize. I don't think we'll necessarily see the same short term rises that we saw recently, but who knows.
There could be a huge sell-off tomorrow following the re-opening of MtGox, followed buy a tremendous rise in demand at a lower price. If that happens, there will be people who bought in at $230, panicking and selling at $70, just to buy back in at a higher price when the market starts to rise.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:50:03
This is a boss right here. Kudos to you for being honest. Some people have to learn the hard way that bubbles will burst and the peak will eventually come.
edit: also have to say that if I would've been in your position, I would've cashed out the major of my BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:19:49
it's held in your bitfloor account. You decided when to buy in for bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:05:14
I've heard a lot of good thinks about bitfloor, so I don't think my money is in jeopardy. It really should be easier to buy bitcoins though. I imagine the second they made it easier to buy, the demand and value would skyrocket.
