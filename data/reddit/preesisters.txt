Nothing about how fucking weird the dollar looks? I don't follow any illuminati bullshit, but you can't blame them entirely. Have you ever looked really closely at how terrifying the dollar bill is?

I sincerely doubt that if you last purchased at 1000

No, they're right. From the rules:

So Tide is now a valid currency?

Did your buddy set you up or am I reading this wrong?

At the rate it's going, I completely agree. Considering the last peak was ~$300 (correct me on that if I'm wrong), and that in btc history it's always crashed after about double the previous peak, I'm gonna have to second the notion of the bubble popping at 600 USD.
However, if in the near future the price falls around $100, I would consider market equilibrium to soon be met for the currency. At least for the volume of users at this point in time.

Honestly, I don't think it's the convenience that gets most people. In the eyes of the lay man, paypal is twice as easy. It's that they got the money quickly *and* that they could have made bank doing next to nothing. You always got to get them where it hurts.

as someone who has been waiting for his coins to clear so he can spend them, I'm a little pissed off at my luck. Fucking thanksgiving and coinbase lag means I have to wait till wednesday to probably use half the money I spent.

what if it doesn't? What if it crashes? Right now I'm banking on the price going up, and when that happens, I'm going to be tempted to cash out in celebration and for the sake of safety.

Ha, no nefariousness here

This would make super cool album artwork. I'd hang that vinyl on my wall, no question

My best would be that the 95-96% of the rest of it was used as stock, though that ignores the other illegal markets that existed/exist.
I don't think that it's a good thing but I certainly believe that it is mostly *used* for illegal activity. I look at it more of a cancerous latent function of bitcoin, though it did act as a nice springboard into the people's attention.

He probably just owed him the money. If I were his friend, I'd just keep the btc, but he could just cash it out, really.

Love this, but Snoop Dogg probably won't help the "bitcoin's for drugs" mentality...

Well, I sure hope you're right, cause it's not lookin like I'll be spending these coins any time soon.

It was probably a 'test' charge; that or an error. You spend all day verifying bank accounts and transactions by hand, you're going to make some mistakes.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:08:59
Yes but it glosses over the ethos behind the currency.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:14:13
wow, only twelve dollars per pepper!
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:19:02
I'm buying after the next crash, then
