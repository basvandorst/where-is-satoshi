Nothing says "look at this gimmicky shit" like adding crypto names in front of normal menu items and calling it a crypto bar.

How is investing money you've already been taxed on into Bitcoin tax evasion? It's only tax evasion if you sell and don't declare your capital gains.

Since when do you have to be involved in Reddit to be involved in Bitcoin?

I think these just allow you to buy Bitcoin with fiat, not withdraw fiat from Bitcoin.

Woah. I never realized dudes could wear capris.
Though with that being said, shorts that go way above the knees seem to be kinda dorky these days. What is the socially acceptable range?

Yeah yeah hindsight is 20/20. Guarantee every last one of them thought Bitcoin was too much of a hassle back when it first came out, if they even knew it existed. I mean let's be real, that's why most of us aren't multi-millionaires right now.

No selling in 2019 until we figure out if the bitcoin time traveler was right about the price this year...

The difficulty isn’t what’s changing, the block reward is cut in half.

If there’s a recession it’ll just be another example of technical analysis becoming true because people believe the technical analysis.
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:37:28
True, that's probably why a lot of us are invested in Bitcoin to begin with. Hell, it's the reason Satoshi made Bitcoin to begin with. The economy is unpredictable and could do just about anything. But I still think it's foolish to create the beast by acting as if it's inevitable. YouTubers love clickbait-y titles though, I guess.

Continuously talking about an “upcoming recession” is going to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Are we really dumb enough to force a recession because the media wants to make Trump look bad?
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:41:21
Not necessarily though. If half of the miners stopped mining the difficulty would adjust and it would be just as easy as it is now. It's simply more accurate to talk about the block reward being cut in half.
@_date: 2019-09-15 05:20:19
Difficulty means a very specific thing in crypto mining. Don't over-simplify. Be precise with your words.

Let's say that everyone (or at least the majority of people) becomes convinced that a recession is imminent. How do you think they will invest? Do you think they will start buying a whole bunch of stocks, or do you think they will start selling stocks to take their profits before the economy starts to decline? The answer is obvious - they will sell stocks to take a profit. What happens to the market when everyone starts selling and fewer people are willing to buy? People have to sell for lower and lower prices. Boom, self-fulfilling prophecy.
Your analogy is completely senseless and irrelevant. Obviously we don't get cancer from people wishing it upon us. The economy, however, is driven by *people* and *how they spend their money*. There's a reason the terms "FUD" and "FOMO" exist. It's not like those were invented by Bitcoiners.

@_date: 2019-09-17 02:22:27


It's all of those things. Economics is a symbiotic relationship. How the hell do people make money without other people spending money? That's a paradox.


And what if investment is your primary income, and talk of a recession gives you reason to believe that income is *not* secure? You're going to take profits just in case. Obviously not everyone...we can't speak in absolutes here.


Haha, okay. Why do news stories have such a profound effect on company's stock prices then? Did Elon Musk smoking weed without inhaling signal any actual turmoil within the company? No, yet the price was affected. Good investors don't trade on emotion...but not everyone is a good investor.


Ah yes, good thing every single investor out there is Warren Buffet and is so rich that they don't have to worry about losing money on investments! /s


You're arguing with a point that is the polar opposite of what I'm saying. You're asking if a real recession caused by handing out subprime mortgages can be avoided if everyone kept their money in the banks that failed. What I'm saying is, if everyone starts pulling out of their investments to "stay alive", because they fear an imminent recession, the market will suffer. It might not be as serious of a recession compared to 2008, but less money being invested is less money being made. Less money being made is less money being spent. Less money being spent means fewer jobs. Fewer jobs means less money to invest. Less money to invest means less money being made.... It's a fairly easy cycle to understand.
But hey, you seem to be the one with the crystal ball here, so why don't you tell me exactly how this is all going to play out?

That 12.5 btc is divided amongst the people in the mining pool that found the block. The only way one person would get all 12.5 BTC is if they solo mined, but there is an extremely small chance of finding a block that way. You could mine forever and never find one.

Man, Chuck Norris jokes sure were funny when they were first a meme like 10 years ago.
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:42:38
Me personally? No, of course not. But if a large number of investors think a recession is coming, they will invest accordingly, which is to say, they will invest less. Do you know what happens when people invest less money in the economy? Like I said, self-fulfilling prophecy.

Anyone who thinks they know for sure what is going to happen with the economy in the next year, I have a bridge that I’d like to sell. I accept bitcoin.
