Essentially. I think the Kreuzberg neighborhood mentioned in this Guardian article provides a lot of the requirements for the start of a bitcoin-centric economy.

Indeed. Their mobile platform is beautiful, which is new to the bitcoin business database world, and their infrastructure seems generally sound...it's just that there's nothing in it right now. So hopefully either they'll tweak it to be functional and content will be added, or someone else will make a sleek working engine. Either way we win.

When I wrote the article, I was on my mobile phone. The mobile browser version does have a search box. I discovered the lack of said feature on the desktop version after publishing, but added a note reflecting that reality(apologies). Their admin isn't the easiest to get in contact with either...

Looks like they've been having issues with bitcoin for a while now.

Thoughts on the tax speculation proposals in the article?

Ah, a little reason and sanity in the midst of...whatever it is that's going on. Good to have some big picture context.

Well,  that's as good a reason as any to postpone. I'm sending my ineffectual good wishes to your daughter.

SeansOutpost: The Hero Bitcoin Needs. Or deserves. I can never keep the two straight, Batman seems to throw both of them out of context. The trio still hanging in there in downtown Pensacola?

One point I neglected in the article is that the stability this provides will cause an explosion of bitcoin innovation in Germany. The fact that there's now a recognized protocol for bitcoin taxation is a big draw for serious investors. I think this will work out well for Germany as the de-facto bitcoin refuge. And yeah, how do I open a German bank account?

"It's just the shit we should all be doing that the status quo has told us is bad."
Good reminder about what's really important. Bitcoin is only as valuable as what it's able to be used for.
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:09:34
Not a half-bad article, the title is a bit misleading about the content. Maybe the editors figured that their readers aren't ready to handle how awesome bitcoin is, so they're trying to keep expectations low.

Hopefully we'll hear more from them as to why they stopped.

I ironically downvoted this particular comment. No disrespect intended, you actually make valid points.
@_date: 2013-08-30 07:55:43
I assume you add the quotation marks in sarcasm, but there's a valid point to be made on the subject. I don't recall the details immediately, but I believe Jason (said something previously about one of the homeless gentleman he's friends with being able to get back on his feet with a job and an apartment. While I don't recall whether that was directly due to his use of bitcoin or not, there's little doubt that that bitcoin provides resources to the (nearly) powerless. Bitcoin is the great enabler.
Significant mental gymnastics aren't required to realize that any one of "us" are roughly three significant life events removed from being homeless "ourselves."  If you follow that train of thought, and factor in the amazingly low cost of a basic Android phone and pay-as-you-go plan against the difficult priorities of someone without consistent food and shelter, you may realize that it's not far-fetched that someone in that situation might be able to prioritize a vital and potentially lifesaving communication device with the side benefit of being able to transact with anyone around the world.
As far as the circumstances that lead to homelessness, I challenge you to listen to Pink Floyd's "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" and read about the inspiration for the song without realizing possible coexistence between absurd intelligence and talent with the inability to to effectively handle the "real" world.  
For some people, being homeless is a purposeful choice even, while potentially misunderstood by those of "us" who live across the street from a grocery store and have the ability to take advantage of that situation anytime we want. Listen to Johnny Cash's "Wrinkled Crinkled Waded Dollar Bill" for a full emotional impact. 
We're all on this wonderful place we call planet earth together, and the sooner we all realize it, the better off things will be. Anyhow, love ya. Full disclosure, multiple beers.

Awesome, I posted a link for takemybitcoins.com, I know there's some other good resources out there though, so pile on.
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:01:41
takemybitcoins.com has a handy list of resources for individuals and orgs interested in accepting bitcoin. 
edit: although the list does include OKPAY, which following this news( isn't up to date anymore...
