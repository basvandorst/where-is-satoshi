Wouldn’t that encourage their supporters to attack your coin?
What would that gain....

Is he saying anything that is incorrect or not publicly verifiable?
It would only matter about OP's credentials if he was throwing out his opinions or if he somehow asked us to trust him.

The guy does appear to be a little unwell from his tweets. 
But I vaguely remember reading there was a higher chance of collision on multisig addresses script hashes. But that was old news from an article that I can’t find now.

What if I trade my warcraft gold into BOEs, sell those BOEs for gold profit then buy some gems and sell those for a loss. Do I have to declare my BOE and gem income?

In his most recent posts he talks about ‘the size of the address space in segwit’ 
and he also mentions multisig. 
I assume he is talking about the small chance of a collision if somebody randomly chooses a multisig wallet that hashes to the same address as a p2sh.
