Shouldn't it say that a withdrawal is pending? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:24:48
I bet you bank at Wells Fargo and Coinbase went to take $300 (because you goofed up and thought you were withdrawing) out of your account when actually you were depositing into Coinbase, but it was also duplicated by Wells Fargo. Do you bank at Wells Fargo?

No, he was just telling you to shut up and then he switched commands and told you to answer his question.

Wow, thanks for sending me down a rabbit hole and have a merry Christmas!

Your best option is to have your parents or another family member/trusted adult buy it on coinbase then have them log into gdax with their coinbase info, transfer the Bitcoin from coinbase to gdax and send it to your paper wallet. Any other way and it won't be worth it because of the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:14:03
This is awesome. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:55:16
Yeah sure because they're just going to send with zero fees to everybody without doing batch transfers.

Sometimes it takes hours. They do batch transfers from gdax.

If you could pay it off in less than a month I'd say why not. But that's just me.

Ben doesn't even know what a Bitcoin is. My grandma could've given more analysis.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:51:55
Sometimes it takes hours. Sometimes it takes minutes. I sent to three wallets from GDAX today twice at the same time one showed within 20 minutes and the other was about 4 hours later. Still waiting on the third transfer. I'm sure it'll be there in the morning, it always is. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:10
Just sent you 100 mBTC I'm so glad I could help you out. Also reported you for begging.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:53:42
Last night when I sent from gdax it took about 4 hours. Just check every now and again it'll get there don't let it beat you up it is free.

You missed my point. I don't care to explain it. You seem to think the government does such a great job why not just stick with fiat, why even get involved with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:07:22
It's broken as in the fact they should have prices on hand like when you go to the store. Go to the doctor and ask them what something will cost before hand. LOL. When I go to the dentist I can discuss prices and shop around. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:46:35
It's both, always has been and always will be.

Because you can't pay someone with your Netflix shares. There's no option in my Ameritrade account to send someone $150 in Netflix for a used mower. I could and have sell shares and write a check from that account, but it's just not the same.

Connect to printer with usb be sure printer is offline and all online functions were disabled and unplug after done to clear temp may still hold copy though just an FYI. Use cheap dedicated printer just for paper wallets.
I guess this all depends on how much and your risk factor. Good luck

If you won't have the funds until the 13th which I'm assuming will be in a checking account that's linked to Coinbase. You'll be able to buy whatever your max buy limit is, but unless you use a credit card you won't have the coin till after the fork. GDAX is out of the question unless you start the transfer soon.

Not trying to sound like d just be sure the code is signed [ author has pgp sig at bottom of page... Then you know it's not malicious. Air-gap and use \*nix livecd not Windoze. OPSEC with paper wallets is super important.

After I posted here I decided to put a thread together on Twitter about good paper wallet OPSEC. [ I used easy to follow graphics to show man in the middle unverified code threat. I've given out 100's of paper wallets over the years that's where it all went. :) Hope this helps.

If you want to increase your limit it's worth it. Of course!

Save it until 2022 and make sure it's like on a paper wallet in fireproof safe and an extra copy at your grandma's house. Good job!

Either will be fine. I just like to have a decent size piece of metal to stamp 24 words with ease. I just had about 30 plates cut out of stainless steel and they work great. The dimensions are in a picture I posted here.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:28:16
Yes, keep that seed phrase safe anybody that gets it can steal the Bitcoin, anyone! Treat it like cash cash that if anybody sees it they can take it; even if they just see a picture of the cash. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:30:44
No worries, I wouldn't even mumble a real seed phrase while writing down or stamping. Always practice good OPSEC you never when an Alexa, Siri or "Okay Google" could be listening. Always sweep for cameras before sitting down at your anvil.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:52:24
Grow up before you end up in a drunken stupor broke because, you smoked and drank all your Bitcoin. You're at a fork if you choose the wrong chain (path) you'll look back at this post if you can remember through all the fog and say -- damn, I went the wrong way. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:37:58
Wait a second Bitcoin Core doesn't have a seed phrase. He must have had another wallet too. If you're seeing Bitcoin in Bitcoin Core then you need a passphrase. I suggest just going to the sidebar and spending a few days researching. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:58:30
Stainless steel is much easier to acquire  and will definitely without a doubt withstand a house fire especially if you keep it in your tl-15 safe. Stainless steel you're good to about 2500°F titanium is about 3000°F so not a big deal.

Move it to a trezor safeguard the seed and ignore it for 5-10 years and then reevaluate; I'm sure that's what your uncle would want you to do. I know that's what I explicitly told my nephews to do when I gave them Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:08:12
This is no laughing matter. Seed phrase storage is serious business. Only n00bs use a passphrase. Think of your family if something happened to you? Store your seed phrase in a secure spot like with your gold &amp; silver. TL-15 at a minimum. They should have to hire a locksmith should something happen to you. Same goes for memory loss from accident and etc... Keep it simple stupid. 
For extra security give your dog a gun too.
