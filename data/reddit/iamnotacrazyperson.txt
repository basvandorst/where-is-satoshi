Poor analogy - he didn't contact the owner, nor were the bitcoins just lying around.

How would you respond to accusations that mtgox's shaky systems may have permanently damaged bitcoin's chances of widespread adoption?

If you had that much wealth consolidated with no clear exit strategy then you're investing unwisely and don't deserve to get all that money back. 
Here's another scenario:
The price reaches $500. However, knowing that a lot of people consider $500 a milestone, you've planned to get out at $473 to beat the rush. You've previously put all of your bitcoins in a registered exchange account and began fractionally selling off your bitwealth in small amounts so as not to scare the market. You complete the trade and slowly fill your bank account with $10k deposits from a variety of exchanges over the next few days. And you're happy - you won! Now you can laugh at the moron who kept all his bitcoins safe in an offline wallet but didn't stop to consider having one single reliable way to turn it into USD in case of emergency.
Sure, you didn't get the maximum $500 per bitcoin that you had secretly hoped to get. But you hedged your bets and came out a hell of a lot richer than you went in.

The guy cashed out TODAY. Just before the drop. [He's some kind of future-telling soothsayer.](

Congratulations dude. But please - PAY BACK THE LOANS. The loan value is a drop in the ocean for you now, pay it while you can!
