If someone made a comprehensive guide on how to properly set up a main net LN node, I would set up many many channels to hopefully help everyone find routes.
Just waiting for that and my node will come online
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:42:54
Hehehe

Depends. 11.2% for the last five years would be severely undeperforming the market.
It is actually a proven fact that you will have greater returns if you just invest in total market etfs than use a financial advisor

If you think 1mb is enough for btcs vision of a global payment system you are very misleaded my friend
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:31
Why the fuck is the price so different on gdax and gemini. Why are people buying for 19.5k when a 16k coin is available? Makes no sense economically
Something is afoot. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:41:08
You're delusional. And clearly not well versed in current prices and mempool backlog 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:53:59
We need larger blocks. Full stop. I am ready to shell out for more storage space to run my node. You should be too. It's not optional to increase from 1mb. May as well make it 10 instead of 1mb increase at a time and have it be a contentious issue every time. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:02:31
I'm happy we are in agreement! :D

LN won't work without a blocksize increase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:53
I like what I have done. I've withdrawn the exact amount that I've invested, riding on pure profit now so I don't stand to lose any of my investment 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:06:04
10mb is still relatively cheap to run full node. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:59:06
U will need to make 2 txns with lightning per 'channel', each which at current rate costs $25. People won't do that.
Also lightning will make increased demand for txns, and the price will go far above $25.
End result nobody will use LN without blocksize increase, I recommend 10mb at least.

It's a fact that on average, you will make less. Some individuals will make more and some will make less, but the average will make less. Fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:44:57
Correction: coinbase is for noobs, that's why price is often higher than other us exchanges. Nobody should be buying for 300$ more on gdax vs. Gemini etc 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:03
Then no

How much war it if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:53:15
Tell that to my $100 txn yesterday that incurred a $5.5 fee
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:29:47
Yes and it could be high again tomorrow's. One data point doesn't mean that this never ending issue is fixed. 
Bitcoin in its current state is unusable for small transactions. Even a $1000 txn incurs too high of a fee a lot of the time to be viable. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:16:36
Never use coinbase for any trades.
You will get reamed and shafted on price. Be ready for a 5% transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:26:18
Gemini, gdax, kraken
Basic any exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:33:22
The price you're paying for a coin is also more. It's a hidden fee that tacks on a solid 2%, sometimes more. Eg. Coinbase says a btc is worth $7k on their site but if u click 'buy' the price you are buying at is 7.1k. Then a 1.6% fee on top of that. You end up at 3.5-5% on every single transaction. Absolutely outrageous. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:37:32
Why use atm? Terrible pricing vs exchange. Get ripped off
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:44:36
Coinbase is fucking terrible use a real exchange noob
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:53:58
It's not an exchange you dingus. People actively trade bitcoin here. You need the coins there to do that (and to make profit). The circlejerk is not necessary here
@_date: 2019-01-01 17:10:59
Still using coinbase
LOL noob 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:59:06
I'll wait for the model 3 because its cheaper and you're still getting a good product 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:44:03

Dont use coinbase. buy from an exchange. coinbase will absolutely shaft you on price.

Can tell you're successful /s
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:53:58
Hurts me that you're on coinbase paying 3% fee (and likely 3% higher price) instead of an exchange but nice 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:52:56
I know right? I cannot use it in the current environment 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:24:43
Do all wallets have this high of a fee right now? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:19:40
Well then right now with the current fees btc is unusable. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:34:45
This isn't market cap. You are comparing the wrong metrics. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:33:02
Coinbase is absolute scum. They charge hidden fees upon hidden fees. Anybody buying bitcoin seriously will steer away from them.
Just use an exchange like Gemini and store it on a ledger or trezor. Literally impossible to lose your bitcoin if your iq is above 40
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:07:55
Much lower fees. Check my post history. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:08:42
I'd recommend nano ledger or trezor. If you place an order now you should have it in a month 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:29:16
What I am wondering is why bitfinex in particular doesn't mirror the other exchanges I.e. Gemini, kraken etc. I have never used bitfinex so I am wondering. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:12:42
This is the relevant answer I was looking for thanks. Rest of posts are misleading 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:43:22
People are willing to pay, $75 a btc is a high price to pay for that considering Gemini is extremely easy to use already with low fees
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:32:17
Why is bitfinex price different to the other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:40:28
Why is there more demand there? That doesn't make economic sense assuming the exchanges have the same barriers to signing up i.e. ID processing time
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:32:54
Gemini 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:34:57
There is really only 1 step to take : don't store your btc in an online wallet like an exchange or coinbase 
It's a 1 step solution to solving your perceived issue
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:05:06
The cost is a lot more than 0.5% more. Let me break it down for you:
1k usd coinbase purchase:
Actual BTC you receive is 990 due to their defined BTC price being 1% higher than actual. Effective fee $10
Fees: 1.5% ($15)
Net fees $25 (2.5%)
1k usd gemini purchase:
Only fee is 0.25% buyer fee (at lowest price tier, if you are a big trader it's less) 
Net fees: $2.5 (0.25%)
You are consciously paying 10x the fees for the same product. I guess your Iq is truly below 40
Oh and I forgot to mention, when you sell the coin you will run into the same fees. So 5% for a buy /sell. Insanity.

Check their website I personally use ledger
