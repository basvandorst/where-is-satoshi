-Bitcoin has  to be MORE than  a currency or a SIMPLE payment method...  
I wait to see and to use OpenBazaar, and Streamium (but with upload possibilities, as YouTube...) because with such apps, Bitcoin has the possibility to challenge eBay and YouTube (in the long term...).

But don't you think it will be duplicate work with Meetup "la Maison du Bitcoin" (June 3rd) ?
BTW yesterday Thomas France said to me others Coffeshops and shops near "La Maison du Bitcoin" will accept Bitcoins soon (La brasserie du Caire entre autres).  
And yesterday for Lunch I was eating at "le Picotin" (Bitcoin payment of course) and I had a drink at the most famous bar in the world (Sof's bar of course).  
Je pense effectivement que les commerces et restaurateurs qui acceptent le Bitcoin doivent être encouragés et réferencés (j'en avais un peu marre d'écrire en anglais);

I don't know if it will be soft or hard fork (I'm not a dev or a miner).
But I think the Bitcoin devs have to increase block size quickly because of... you.    
Because you're doing a great job with OpenBazaar and soon (when OB will be on mainnet) it would lead to a dramatic growing of the number of transactions...

Hello,  
I think you are confusing 2 different orders :   
1/ : 1 * Litecoin Die Cast Lapel Pin : I ordered this one on Ebay to Evilos (are you Evilos?) : it was paid by me (I am graham751 on Ebay) by Paypal on march 14th.
This order is OK, I received Litecoin pin (USPS tracking : LZ612642547US) on March 25th.   
2/ : I ordered also on  (paid with Bitcoins) 2*Bitcoin Lapel pins, February, 27th.  
I HAVE NOT received this order and I haven't any news about this order.
I paid $32 for this order (0.127181 BTC) on Bitcoinpins.com (Bitpay payment processor).  
  
  
Please, deliver to me (to France), 2*Bitcoin pins I paid on February, 27th.

My wish : stop looking Bitcoin for US only and focus on 6 billions people outside US (and they will use Bitcoins too). 
@_date: 2015-11-16 14:33:11
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:31:50
That's a very good idea.  
I think it's important to accept Bitcoin for basic food products (and not only for coffee and restaurants)....   
A grocery or delicatessen accepting Bitcoins can attract tourists, Bitcoin enthusiast, migrants...  
The current situation isn't logical because now Bitcoins are mainly accepted for a large range of specialized products (computers, furniture, accessories, electronic....) but not so much for basic products (food).  
Unfortunately, I live 3800 miles away from Toronto.... but good luck.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:54:50
I confirm for France...   
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:28:18
Very important.  
Bitcoin has to be international to win.  
Bitcoin community is often too much focused on US and forgets 6 billions Bitcoin potential users...
@_date: 2016-10-30 21:03:16
