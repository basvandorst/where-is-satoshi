I understand the need to increase security and verify our identities, but I have sent multiple emails and opened multiple support tickets and attached a scan of my drivers license, paycheck stub, and a utility bill! I have been trying to get my account (username: bahnfire) opened up for a while now and I have had a very long period of NO emails/responses. The response that I did receive was that you were adding some new software to help you sort this mess out and that my account would be reviewed quicker. Well, what happened? Why are you still holding my money? The withdraw that I am making is to a verified DWOLLA account (I spoke with them and they have my SSN, address, etc) and I am using my USB key that I purchased from you.
EDIT: Do not mean to hijack the thread... just want answers. I have also sent you (MtGox_Adam) at least 1 Reddit message RE: my details/issue and I have not heard back. If you have so many requests, I should be close to the top of the list since my issues started on 9/9/11!.

I have the same issue - except I have only received 1 response in about a week, and my issue has been ongoing for almost a month now. They claim that they are overloaded and that they are working on it, etc. 
EDIT: The link to my post in the MtGox subreddit is [here]( The funny thing is that I cannot find it on any of the views on their subreddit and had to click on my history to find it...

There are more like us. I was on the IRC channel and there are loads of folks waiting around for this to get fixed, as well as on the support forum.

I can have them email the company and verify. I will be in China in a about a month as well and can verify if I have the contact information.

Just sent 23.856BTC for a gift card. 
I noticed that your "thank you" email is not properly formatted. It says that is it coming from 'www-data' and the title has HTML tags in it that look like they are supposed to be in the body.

I have a few engineers in DG/GZ China at our factory. Send PM with info and I can verify your claim that you are working with a company in that area.

I also agree with ALL of the other posters - a picture (even a distant picture that shows no real detail) will help greatly. While it is not impossible to reverse engineering something from a photo, this would most likely be too complicated to do so if only 1 side of the PCB was shown. The secret sauce that you are selling is NOT the PCB design - it is the software/code in the ICs. Anyone can design a reference board with a datasheet, and if this is truly a tablet reference design from the GZ area it is not hard to come by (as I have worked with many local companies to design a few tablets already).

Just an update - I received my e-gift card on 11/23 and it works! Apparently it took a little longer since I missed the emails (due to my junk email settings) - but Shane was responsive via email.

What you have described is VERY generic when talking about PCBs. I just designed the space shuttle - I used heat resistant tiles and a rocket engine... just because I know the basics does not mean I really did it.
How many layers is the PCB? What external interfaces will be used? Can you show a screenshot of the command/control software?

Wow... what a dick move.
