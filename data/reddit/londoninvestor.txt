0.1 bitcoin but the smaller kind private

Obviously true for cash, but you can insure against theft of cars and iphones, also if they are stolen the police or authorities will investigate.

Hopefully you manage to save with bitcoin, but keep in mind that 650 for 50,000 USD is a 1,3% fee, I assume your biggest hit was on currency conversion which might still be an issue especially now that you introduce another currency, but you also might get lucky on currency conversion where the currencies appreciate/depreciate in such a way that is beneficial to you.

So Bitcoin you say bitcoin is a purely speculative 'asset', better leave it to the better informed speculators and technical analyst. I invest in the stock market more based on fundamentals. I'm going to research a bit more, but it seems this is not my cup of tea. Especially since there are no protective measures in place to even safeguard the investment from theft (i.e it is impossible for stocks to be stolen)

Haha sorry, it was a reply to the comment below. Reddit commented on yours for some reason...

Ok so I should just wait until there are Bitcoin Banks before changing some money into bitcoin. But do you think my current large bank will support Bitcoin as well, or there will be only separate specific Bitcoin Banks?

So what are the alternatives to paper wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:34:51
I dont think you will save on any fees, bank transfer fees are usually capped and shouldnt cost you more than fifty USD for any amount (but probably be way less), also if you are looking to transfer the money from USD to AUD then with amounts larger than 50k, the bank's treasury department will give extremely good rates. 
If you are looking to use bitcoin keep in mind there is usually a fee when depositing and a fee when withdrawing as well as currency risk (the bitcoin price may move up or down), also the exchanges used might take higher fees are currency conversion.
In terms of taxation and not having to possibly deal with inquiries as to the source of funds, it might be easier for you if you transfer money from a bank account with your name directly to a bank account with your name, rather than get the money transferred in from a third party. Also if you talk to the bank they might be able to waive the fee, especially if you are opening a bank account with the same international bank in Australia.

Yes I heard about paper wallet. But then how do you spend your bitcoin, for example in a shop? You give them the paper wallet, and they give you change on a paper wallet - e.g. cost 0.4 BTC, I give them 0.5BTC paper, and they give me back 0.1BTC paper?

How Coins are destroyed?
This could simply be done in the following way: When someone exchanges coins to USD, the coins are transferred into a wallet/account that cannot be accessed (this is publically seen as well), leaving just the right amount of coins in circulation. If coins are bought, we could transfer the coins from that wallet/account to the buyer. 
All exchange is on this automated account, that can be seen by everyone but not accessible to anyone. If you buy the coin you deposit USD, if you sell you withdraw USD. There is no administrator, somehow an automatic system is formed.

Yes but if bitcoin is not used for anything, and people only keep buying, wont it create a bubble? 
@_date: 2014-10-17 10:30:01
People running the nodes are incentivised the same way as in Bitcoin: through transaction fees. 
Of course the governments would attack this system, however it would be set up in a similar way as Bitcoin, and it would be impossible to shut down or convict users even if they use it for dubious activities. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:14:23
That doesnt look very simple...
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:50:04
Are there any public bitcoin companies?
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:03:17
That doesnt look very simple...Also I have a Macbook...

As long as we are paying for goods and services using USD, we need to back the coin with that, in order to facilitate transactions. Of course if the fiat currency fails, then the coin will still remain, break away from the peg, and trade completely as a free floating currency.

25 BTC/block DIVIDED by 3000 transactions/block = 0.0083 BTC/transaction 
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:15:36
Why do you say that? Am I a fool because I have limited technical knowledge and therefore am at a greater risk of losing any money i would put into bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:52:13
The problem with this Brock Pierce coin is: "Realcoin will maintain a real-time record of all USD reserves that will be held in “conservative investments” and the full record will be authenticated by the block chain."
Any investment carries risk - what if the investment loses money?, then people owning the coin will also lose money. 
I am not planning to introduce a trusted third party. Some system has to be created where it is apparent that the reserves are visible and audited to everyone, noone can access the money only in the way the system is set up, i.e by purchasing or selling coins. 
Isn't Paypal much worse than Bitcoin for transactions - less efficient, less safe?
Converting between USD and Bitcoin still has exchange rate risk, because the price moves are so volatile and large, and for larger transactions there might not be enough liquidity to cover the exchange. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:49:25
You are right. Thats why Im looking for an investment, so far I invest into stocks and ETFs, I was thinking about bitcoin, but based on everything I read here I'm unsure this would be a smart decision. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:34:11
If you buy the coin, you deposit USD in the account of the coin.
 
If you wish to withdraw USD for your coin, the USD is paid out from the account. 
How hard is it to rebalance the markets?
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:39:19
Obviously the whole point would be that they use the easy to use system in place of $$$. 
How do people in poorly banked areas withdraw their money from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:54:23
How many transactions per day with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:49:40
I hold 100 coins
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:49:13
But you have to use the exchange to buy and sell bitcoin, so it is part of the bitcoin system. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:43:08
Yes but Bitstamp is using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:42:46
Countless news articles and even r/bitcoin talking about it in the past days. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:41:14
Oh WOW. I missed that news. Who was appointed the new CEO? Cant find any articles, and there is no management team listed on yahoo finance. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:35:19
People here follow every post and news and statistics on bitcoin - so you are the best people to ask for this security analysis. Also you may know how good the development/running team is in fixing exploits quickly
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:04:30
I dont think bitcoin and USD are comparable assets. Also banks have the amounts insured in case they are hacked and as a result would go bankrupt.

I hope he paid in bitcoin

What I find concerning is she does have some problems in places. Obviously all together I'm quite amazed how frictionless and acceptable it can be, and you can really use it anywhere...
