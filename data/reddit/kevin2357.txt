It's not really that bitcoin is difficult to trace, or that it's completely anonymous as the media sometimes reports. The main rub is that your real-world identity isn't stored in the system anywhere.
Say you wanted to deposit $100 into my checking account. I could give you my bank routing number and account number, and you could send your deposit to that "digital address". Just from looking at that routing/account number alone, you'd have no idea who I was in real life - but the bank knows, and if the police ever came to them and asked "who is the owner of account number 0123456789?" the bank could use my account number to lookup my name, address, and SSN and give it to them.
Say you wanted to deposit 1 BTC into my bitcoin wallet. I would give you my bitcoin address, which functions as my digital ID within the bitcoin network, and you would send your 1 BTC transaction to that address. The difference is that there's no central authority here who ties that address to my real world ID - when you open a bank account, a banker takes down your name, address, and SSN before creating the account, and checks it against your government issued ID. When you create a new bitcoin address, nobody takes down any additional information or checks any ID, so there's no easy way in the bitcoin system for the police to ask "what is the name and address of the person who owns address 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy?"
The various servers running in the bitcoin world do usually keep server logs, and don't do anything on their own to try to obfuscate IP addresses. The blockchain records all transactions that occur (which bitcoin addresses have transferred how many BTC between each other). The system is traceable in terms of server logs, IP addresses, and bitcoin addresses; it's just not the easiest thing to do to piece all of that together and get a clear picture of what real-world entities are exhanging BTC this way. Also, many people who use bitcoin - and certainly any criminals who try to use it - will ultimately sell their BTC on exchanges. Exchanges link traditional bank accounts to bitcoin addresses, so there's some potential for the exchanges themselves to be subpoenaed for their records of what bitcoin addresses have made deposits or withdrawals from what bank account numbers.
