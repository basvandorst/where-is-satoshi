 thanks for your reply.
After TheHelpfulGuy reply I do get the checksum concept now, and I understand that it is virtually not possible to mess up the address e.g. while copying or as a result of malware.
Still, from the very beginning the idea I proposed was NOT supposed to be any type of strong security check. Just a visual hint.
And as for the slight color differences in the algorithm I proposed I'm hashing the address once again, so that even small alterations should result in very different combinations colors (we're not comparing single colors only).
But of course I agree, that it is way more easier for anybody to generate two similarly-looking swatches than two similarly-looking addresses or even decrypt the private key.
The idea was just to make the process of comparing and distinguishing  addresses a little bit quicker and easier (even if not 100% secure and bullet proof) - just as a secondary reinforcement of the validity of the address.
Btw. you're mentioning other approaches of making the UX of the bitcoin transactions better (?). I'd love read more about them! Can you share some links, please?
Thanks again for all your comments to this idea. I got to know something more. :)

Ha! I'm a newbie, as I said, and it seems that I've just learned a new thing! Thanks for the explanation! :)
Still, as a newcomer to Bitcoin I **did not** know that! I would assume that most people don't know as well.
From what you're saying I'm assuming that if I try to send bitcoins to an invalid address, the wallet software will not allow me to do that. You also imply that generating "look-alike" addresses for malicious purposes is almost impossible (vanitygen etc.).
Fair enough. From technical point of view it's superb (as the Bitcoin concept in general!).
Nevertheless, the human factors still apply - what I'm suggesting is that it would be great if we don't only make it easier for mobile devices (QR codes) but also for mere humans, so that we can just perceive, distinguish, compare and remember the addresses better.
TL;DR: but it would make stuff easier for humans

Let me paraphrase the purpose of the idea:
While making bitcoin transactions I do check whether I put the correct address in the field. Just to make sure. 
I usually do it by **comparing** some 3-5 last or first **digits*. 
I'm sure other people do it somehow similar (do you?).
If the digits are the same *I assume* the address is OK.
The swatches would serve similar purpose (letting you assume that the address is OK), but you would do it with **colors** (which is faster and easier), not numbers.
Just like that.
