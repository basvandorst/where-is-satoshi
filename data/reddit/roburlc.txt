As an investment strategy, buying Gold is not necessarily a stupid move
Buy maybe when the fear premium is at its lowest. If the news is boring, and the price is down: that might be the time to buy. MIGHT BE. It's an investment in emotions, and will be most affordable/allow the best uptick... when emotions are placid. Things will change .Maybe not in your favor. Don't easily buy metal Gold on "fundamentals" - these are already polluted beyond correcting. If you must buy, sentiment could be your best guide.

They are called 'fiat currencies' in reference to the Latin phrase in the Bible: "fiat lux" (="let there be light")
Let there be currency.
Over the life times of most people still breathing, globally economic output has progressed significantly more rapidly than the availability of metallic Gold. If the expansion of notional economic output were limited to track the expansion of physical Gold supply, that could yield delightful polemics for academic economists; many of the rest of us might however feel the pinch in a very unsettling way.

I sometimes read, with horrid fascination, the screeds of gold bugs who predict the collapse of fiat currency: in favor of a regimen based on Au metal.
That might be well and fine; but if the total of all gold ever produced  were equivalently monetized, US dollar M2 alone would kick it up to USD 1750/oz. Add in any other currency, and the problem just gets worse.
A reversion to an honest gold standard would trigger a depression the likes of which would make the early 30's look like a rowdy party with frills and balloons.
