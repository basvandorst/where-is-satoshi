Thanks. Right now we are tightly integrated with a partner for the entire sell/buy process flow and don't have a means to route sold cards to alternate buyers. We can look at this option in the future though!

Agreed. We are starting with a limited pool of 8 merchants and will expand as we resolve any bugs and weigh the addition of new merchants as market demand warrants. Thanks!

The offers are based on two factors: 1) the going resell value of the given card to establish the dollar value and 2) to get the bitcoin offer, an aggregate of several bitcoin exchanges at the time an offer is made. A user has five minutes to accept a bitcoin or cash offer, otherwise, the offers expire. They can re-add the card to get an updated offer, if desired.

Understood. Just wanted to confirm. Yes, if/when we support the individual Amazon cards we will post it to the community.  Thanks again.

Interesting. We have only been in production for 27 minutes. Payouts are made in 24-48 hours. Not sure how you can be scammed so soon. Feel free to drop us a line via the website and we would be happy to research any issues you're having. However, if you're just being negative then we hope you have a better day...even though we know Mondays stink.

It doesn't and that is not the purpose of collecting this. The purpose is to protect the card buyer from double spend (e.g. the card seller uses the card after it has been sold to a new customer).

Is this for an individual's Amazon card or are you a company that has a bulk? The Amazon process and requirements are a bit different than other merchants.

Not sure why you would say that.  Have you tried the system?
