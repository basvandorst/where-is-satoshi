Reddit members who were part of our beta launch: we have started to receive the first orders. Payment will be sent in 3-4 days. You should have received an email today.
Let us know if you have any questions.

You may need to double click on the condition, this shouldn't be possible.
Let us know if that doesn't work, thanks.

Hey guys! 
We initially created this service as an experiment to gauge public interest, and have gotten more pageviews on our site since 3am EST this morning than we've gotten in the past month trying to convince people to donate smartphones to help projects on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
We are working towards making it an easier process for everyone as well as adding more categories of consumer electronics, and possibly adding things like textbooks and video games. Our pricing mechanism is pretty rough right now, so we will be optimizing it to ensure prices are consistent across each product. We want to be the go to site for people who want to turn old products into shiny new Bitcoins. We are also continuing to explore ways in which technology could be used to revive the barter-economy.
In the meantime, feel free to trade in smartphones for Bitcoins. We will be processing all orders by hand, and those who have ordered today should receive pre-paid mailing envelopes by Thursday of this week. 
Most importantly, we have added a Feedback tab to the first page. If you have ideas about what we can do better, what you would like us to do, or any thoughts, please help us make our service better by letting us know. 
Thanks!
