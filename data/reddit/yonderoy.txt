You can withdraw bitcoin from Coinbase to any wallet address. One downside is that you will have to pay a transaction fee.
There are many ways to create a wallet, some safer than others.
However I would strongly recommend reading up bitcoin before moving it out of Coinbase. Here is a good place to start: 
Good luck!

I use it. it's a little rough around the edges. Probably growing too fast. That said I've successfully bought/sold/deposited/withdrawn. Still, I don't recommend keeping more than you can afford to loose on the exchange.

Following your phone number is convenient, but from what I understand, SMS 2FA is MUCH less secure.

I was wondering the same thing. Kraken has been ridiculous for a while now but to be down this long is bush league stuff.  
They're supposedly one of the highest volume exchanges in Europe, no?

I was selling BTC on eBay in 2014. Got scammed by about 1/3 of the buyers and stopped. PayPal ended up giving me back about 30% of the USD back after lots of complaining. Was a shitty situation. I wonder what the eBay crypto market looks like now. I’d be surprised if it’s much better.

Back in 2014 I was selling btc on eBay. Turns out about half of the buyers were scammers using hacked accounts. PayPal ending up refunding half of those after hours upon hours of talking with high level support reps. Very scared of selling crypto if PayPal is involved.

Check out their post on Reddit in which they admit to problems with the exchange and ask us to wait till they roll out a re-vamped version soon.

I hear you. I lost 11BTC when my gox account was hacked a month BEFORE it shutdown. Then I bought some goxbtc trough bitcoinbuilder.com, anybody remember that one?

I disagree. However I think hype has A LOT to do with the price of bitcoin today.

Haha. Sure thing.

I appreciate the name. I remember the time and place when I first learned I could only eat so much pineapple before the acid overwhelmed my tongue. Your choice to donate such a large amount of your money is outrageous as in: "very bold, unusual, startling". I imagine you are already overwhelmed by the volume of responses and now the hardest part has become sorting through them...good luck. I'm going to be following the pants off of this one.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:31:55
I imagine credit cards will be just as difficult to deal with though. Inherit problem with selling crypto currencies is the  irreversibility. Someone buys BTC with a stolen cc. Once owner initiates chargeback you can be damn well sure the cc will take their money back out of your bank account before you can  blink.

Will that be a problem in the future if people don’t transact much with bitcoin? If everyone’s holding, will it be worthwhile for miners to keep running?
