I'm in Canada so liquidity is worse for bigger purchases (Mine was 2+ BTC like I said). I thought the service itself has a lot of potential but the order didn't get filled and I found better so I cancelled. The withdrawal still hasn't gone through and another OKcoin withdrawal I made has like 7 confirmations and it went out after.

It got confirmed eventually anyways. My short term rage has faded, I still think your service is awesome (bit less for Canada but still). Good luck.

Wow that is pathetic. Additionally they have 2FA but don't use it for withdrawals which is complete nonsense.

Everything is jammed into 1 transaction to avoid bloat but that doesn't make it less anonymous. It's not looking to hide behind big numbers of transactions, it doesn't have to. Once the money is denominated into 1s 10s 100s and mixed with the others denominations again and again, you can't follow the trail, it's all the same size.

Can't wait to see it!

As far as Dash/Darkcoin goes, it's not as simple as you think it is. Dash uses an advanced form of coinjoin (like join market but way better). It does this BEFORE the actual transaction, it's passive mixing. 
You deposit 1000 dash to your wallet and start the process (currently called darksend). It denominates your 1000 into 1s 10s 100s etc and runs them through rounds of decentralized mixing. You can increase the number of rounds up to 16 if I recall correctly. Each round adds additional security. 
The "mixing" is done by masternodes, these are nodes which anyone who owns or buys 1000 dash can start (you can't cheat this process) . They service the entire network by enabling the mixing (signing transactions), but also by being full 24/24 nodes usually hosted on fast vps instances. For doing this masternodes get rewarded directly from the blockchain by getting paid a set % amount of each block, chosen at random between all active masternodes. There are 576 blocks per day and close to 3000 masternodes which means on average you'd get paid once every 5.xx days. 
Now the masternodes are chosen at random to sign the transactions for mixing which means you can't hope to snoop on people's transactions by owning one. Especially since mixing uses multiple rounds which change masternodes every time. Owning even as much as half the masternodes (at a price of quite a few million $) doesn't get you close to being able to track people. 
Once the money is mixed, you simply have access to premixed funds, once you use part of it, the rest gets mixed again in case there was change. 
Another cool thing enabled by masternodes is decentralized governance by blockchain (DGBB). Anyone can submit a proposal to the network for funding related to working on the dash project (programmers, designers, marketers, etc). Masternodes owners can then vote to accept these projects and people are paid directly from the blockchain blocks in an automated manner. The dash network has a fund every month automatically assigned for these projects and all dash that isn't used gets cancelled by the network.

Well every darksend transaction  works that way. It jams everything into one big transaction  split into tons of pieces. Once you actually use the anonymized money, it just looks like a Simple transaction, albeit composed of denominated outputs. Like paying 122 dash will be 100+10+10+2+2 -&gt; 122. Now the anonymity is when you try to find the origin of these denominated outputs created by mixing your money. They've been mixed up to 16 times, every time being mixed with denominations of exactly the same size.

Your best bet at understanding it is the white paper. The good thing about dash not being based on complicated cryptography for anonymity is that it can't be broken. It's simple math and large numbers.

Here's the dash Explorer 
Check a few blocks you'll see denominated outputs in a lot of them.

Haha true!

Monero is based on ring signatures. Zerocoin is the old protocol abandoned by the developers in favour of the more advanced zero cash, coming Soon©
The number of transactions doesn't change anything really in either case (dash/monero)

No idea where it was developed tbh. I'm not an expert on cryptography anyways, I don't know what can be cracked or not or weakened Intentionally etc.
