I agree. There are far better uses for Bitcoin than supporting Lamborghini.  Look at the Pineapple Fund, they are doing great things for very worthy causes.
Greed is never good.  Some of us out here want to work on the larger issues to make a better world.  It will not be without regulation, that's a pipe dream, but it can be well-designed common-sense regulation that fosters innovation rather than stifles it.
One thing to keep in mind, US stock markets are largely [b]self-regulated,[/b] by an association of the exchanges called FINRA.  This is a direction that cryptocurrency could go in, by educating law and policymakers and advocacy.
The technology is here.  The genie is out of the bottle, so to speak.  We have an opportunity to pick up the ball and carry it as far down the field as we can.  That's what I'm working towards.

Hi Diddy,
In early 2012, I downloaded Bitcoin-Qt and played with it.  Had somewhere around 50 BTC.  Decided if it ever truly threatened the monetary system, it would be outlawed.  Thought I had backed up my WALLET.DAT but unfortunately it was stored under C:\ProgramData, which I had not backed up.
Bitcoin is not just about investing, nor about protesting the monetary system, it is about [b]replacing it.[/b]  This will happen, is just in the very early stages right now.
The technologies that bitcoin brought together, especially peer to peer distributed ledger, can be applied to obsolete other central control structures as well, such as content silos like Facebook and Twitter, distributed search that is open and fair, providing people that create content more control over their data and better ways to monetize it.  These technologies will change the very fabric of society itself.  The technology, economic, and social climate is in a unique position to make that change.
My non-profit BTRIC (Blockchain Technologies Research Innovations Corporation) is doing it's part to help that happen.  It has a novel approach to incubating projects with good ideas into viable, top-shelf businesses.  Also doing the same for non-profit charitable causes.  Consider getting involved, either as a donor in our Founding Donor token fundraiser, by participating in our governance or other initiatives, or simply by spreading the word to others that you know feel the same way about Bitcoin and the tech and its potential to reshape the world.  Working together, we will do great things for the field, and also for society.  It's a unique opportunity in world history and we must make the most of it.
Best regards,

Absolutely.  Our website is at   A thread that explains a summary of what we're about is on bitcointalk at   Detailed information about BTRIC is in our white paper which can be downloaded at 
I wish you the best for your organization!  Mr. Pine has selected some really great groups that are changing the world and I know his contributions are going to help their missions immensely.
It's really good to see someone putting their Bitcoin wealth to serving a greater good.  It's this spirit that drove me to start our organization, so that we can focus on projects that will be making a difference in the world.
Thanks again, and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me.
Best regards.

To sell them you will need to create an account on an exchange, such as Coinbase.com.  Once you do that, you can send the Bitcoins from your husbands Bitcoin address to the address that Coinbase makes for you and then withdraw it as USD into your bank account.  If he has 1500 BTC, you might have trouble selling that all at once through Coinbase, I don't have any experience with that amount of BTC.

Best thing to do now is to try to break it. Breaking it on testnet means it can be fixed with no real damage done. Breaking it on main could be catastrophic depending on what and how it breaks.

First of all this is horrible for low-income account holders.  They should move their banking somewhere else. There are online options available nationwide that won't charge you a cent.
Second, these banks are not friendly to those that have to convert funds between crypto and fiat.  And signs are that it's getting worse all the time, not better.
My organization is exploring going through the process of chartering a federal credit union (which like all credit unions would be owned and governed by account holders) that specializes in these so-called "high risk" crypto/fiat transactions for people and businesses. It would give a level playing field not only to users of crypto but also make it much easier for projects such as exchanges to do business in the U.S.
A successful federal credit union charter application requires sufficient interest from the targeted group of members (in this case, cryptocurrency users) for it to be granted by the NCUA.

Awesome that you're running a full node on a RPI.
Some people say that running a full node without mining is a waste.  I disagree, it supports the resilience of the network.  My non-profit organization, BTRIC, currently runs two full nodes, one on in-house hardware here at our offices in Lakewood, NJ, and a second on a VPS in Dallas, TX.  After we get past our launch token fundraising campaign, I plan on running at least one that is non-US based on excess infrastructure to further help the network.
As far as powering the external HDD, usually you can use a Y splitter to a USB power source that supplies sufficient amperage for the HDD.  Best of luck with your node!

Wow!  This study shows an outstanding result!  I had heard of MDMA being studied for the treatment of PTSD but had no idea it was proving such efficacy.  MAPS is doing great work here and I support it and their work in finding better treatments using a variety of drugs, especially psychedelics as many of them were, in fact, originally developed for therapeutic use.  I believe that any substance that can treat illness better than what is currently used should be available to those who need it, not withheld simply because the government decided that it's abuse potential is too high.
Thank you Pineapple Fund for supporting what looks to be a very exciting and promising project that will have major impact on those that suffer from PTSD.
I also want to note that the business structure of a 501(c)(3) owning a for-profit corporation, including a public benefit corporation, is absolutely a great practice!  It's the same approach that BTRIC takes to incubating projects that focus on emerging technology.  We research develop and incubate under BTRIC and when they're viable businesses, we divest them into separate entities.  I've had to explain this to donors several times and I just wanted to chime in and say that yes it's absolutely legal and is done by many organizations.  A non-profit cannot engage in any significant for-profit activity, but they can own businesses that do.  The profits of the business are considered like any investment gain that is held by a non-profit would be.  We are going to be publishing guidance regarding this type of structure under Creative Commons license to encourage wider use in emerging technology projects.  I believe it's a great, ethical and sustainable, business model that needs wider attention and adoption.
Good luck on this fundraising campaign, it can really do a lot of good for a lot of people!

There needs to be a better way for survivors to be able to liquidate crypto assets. Perhaps a trusted service that is insured, bonded, and either an attorney or CPA.

Absolutely. A number of studies have demonstrated it's huge potential in being a life-saver for people suffering with PTSD.  The trouble is, no one wants to fund the trials.  It's essentially taboo.  That is why the Pineapple Fund's support, and **a commitment to match funds** is huge!  We can all support this work that is very difficult to get funded through NIH grants, etc.
I know a few people who suffer from PTSD, some worse than others.  You can feel so helpless when they are triggered.  The people I know are on various treatments (SSRIs and the like) but none of them seem to be totally effective.  In my experience, it's reduced the number of episodes, but does nothing for their severity.  I am going to be following this work closely.

Governments will regulate cryptocurrency and the new business models.  However, we can shape that through advocacy and education.  I have a long experience in advocacy work, though I'm just beginning my journey of doing so for emerging tech.  [b]Governments too, to some degree, are in fact at the mercy of private central banks.[/b]  Looking at the world, governments will not completely stifle innovation in this field.  They know how easy it is to form businesses in most jurisdictions around the globe, playing "regulatory arbitrage", and will support reasonable regulation.  I am confident of that having reviewed all materials by U.S. regulators (CFTC, SEC, OCC, Treasury, NCUA, Federal Reserve Board of Governors).  I have to look into state-level regulation but there too, it's mostly favorable.  Education, outreach, and advocacy go a long way in helping shape the regulations, rather than being shaped by them.

I am not in this for the money. I run a charity to help others build their ideas into great businesses. I am paid very modestly for my work. I just need enough to get by and keep BTRIC (the charity) operating. I left a job where I was making more because I believe in the power of decentralization and I became very jaded about the work I was doing (government contracting mostly).
Also, yes I am white.  However, one of BTRIC's primary initiatives is to promote more women and diversity in projects, both as users but also as those involved on the project team.

"While it is unclear to what extent major Bitcoin holders who have increased their assets through the end of the year will bolster consumer spending through the beginning of year remains, Nomura is confident that there is a distinct possibility that spending, and thus GDP, will exceed expectations as a result of this factor."

Our non-profit business incubator is sponsoring investigation of chartering a federal credit union that would specialize in dealing with people and businesses that transact in cryptocurrency.
While the eventual goal of crypto is to do away with these financial institutions, some gateway to the legacy finance system will be needed for some time, and a member-owned credit union would allow its members to have an ownership stake in the CU as well as full financial transparency.  If chartered, we also plan on offering services that will make it much easier for businesses (potential exchanges, etc.) to comply with KYC/AML/CFT requirements by building much of that work into the CU.  Fact is, many smaller institutions have inefficient, manual processes for dealing with FinCEN AML requirements, and the big guys have no incentive to do much either (since crypto customers make up a tiny fraction of their accountholder base).
Consider getting involved, we really think it'll be a great addition to the emerging technology ecosystem.
Good luck with your new house!

No that is part of the U.S. government (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), though you're right it is very cool!  Innovations in building technology is important as we try to raise the standards of living for people across the world.
No, the BTRIC that we are building is called Blockchain Technology Research Innovations Corporation (  We are a 501(c)(3) that focuses on incubating emerging technology projects, such as blockchain distributed ledger, cryptocurrency, IoT, etc.  How we work is we accept a project into our program, provide it with the resources (team members, funding, infrastructure) it needs to develop its product or service, and then we prepare it to be separated as an independent business.  We have plans to do so for three projects at the present, and we'll be accepting more after our launch fundraiser is completed.
The three projects we're incubating at this time are one code named "Cryptocurrency for Good", which is a way to increase the use of crypto among non-profit organizations by accepting donations for any U.S. based 501(c)(3) public charity and then remitting those funds to the charity **as Bitcoin.**  We are going to form a partnership with one of the exchanges in the U.S. that can offer a streamlined path to onboard those charities into their own accounts so they can use and/or convert to fiat their donations, but the focus is getting crypto transactions out to a wider group of people, to help the process of mainstream acceptance.
The second project we're incubating is a project related to seafood traceability, which is a major problem in the U.S.  The government regulators, NOAA Fisheries, have mandated a system be put in place in certain types of seafood, and it's expected to broaden over time, as you can see here: (  This project will enable tracking of seafood from the point of harvest (wild-capture or farmed) or the point of importation all the way through to the end consumer.  Through a special purpose blockchain, parties that deal with this seafood (some of which has been done fraudulently) will have a trustless system to verify the chain of custody.  It will help the marketplace because domestic producers will not have to compete against "shady" sources that may have cheated the system.  When this project is done being incubated, it will be divested from BTRIC as a separate for-profit business.
The third project we are working on right now is code named "Cryptocurrency Federal Credit Union", and its purpose is to survey the cryptocurrency and emerging technology industry, businesses and users, and determine if sufficient interest exists to apply for a federal credit union charter from the NCUA.  As said, the first step in that process is to conduct a statistically valid survey.  If the results are positive, then you can move on into the chartering process.  I believe that people and businesses that transact in fiat/crypto face large challenges in dealing with financial institutions and that a **member-owned** federal credit union could provide real benefits to the community.  It would, of course, specialize in the type of transactions that many banks and other financial institutions run away from because of the high burden of anti-money laundering/economic sanctions/financing of terrorism compliance that is necessary.  It will also allow new businesses in the ecosystem to get up and running with a reliable partner for their checking, savings, debit card, ACH, etc.  Though the eventual goal is to replace these financial institutions, "bridge institutions" will be needed for some time, and this project proposes to create such an institution that would be owned and governed by its account holders, as all with an account are members of a non-profit credit union.  So the goal for divesting this is to do so as a non-profit federal credit union.
That's what BTRIC is working to make a reality.  The larger issue, about 501(c)(3) structure with for-profit subsidiaries, is something that BTRIC also wants to promote through what we call "BTRIC Institute", our advocacy and outreach initiative.  Fact is, regulation will happen in the crypto space.  It's better to shape it, instead of being shaped by it.  Coin Center is doing work in this area, and we want to bolster their efforts.
Everything BTRIC does is open-source (MIT) and/or open-licensed (Creative Commons), so the work we do can be adapted/remixed/used for everyone in the ecosystem.
Thanks for your interest in BTRIC, I appreciate it!  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Again, thank you, we appreciate the support!  We're working hard to do great things for this rapidly evolving field.
As far as the Pineapple Fund, we missed the current window to apply.  When it opens again, we certainly will do so, we think our organization offers a lot of good in the emerging technology ecosystem.  But, at the same time, projects such as this PTSD study, in the grand scheme of things, are a priority.  Imagine how great it would be to have a treatment that can really [b]"cure"[/b] PTSD.  That is an amazing study, and I hope it produces the results in a P3 trial that it's shown so far.  Really awesome!
I hope you have a great day!

Is this the Japanese court matter?
I don't know the laws there but in the United States the job of a bankruptcy trustee is to represent the best interest of creditors (aka anyone that lost money) and to monetize assets at the best price.  This could be a breach of their fudiciary duty.

Thanks for the info.  Sounds like a mess with many entanglements.  I hope it resolves itself favorably for you and everyone else involved.
I agree that liquidation now is unnecessary, if there's enough cash on hand especially.  Bitcoin is not a depreciating asset, quite the contrary, especially if we're talking about ongoing litigation, that could take some time.
I am not familiar with Japanese bankruptcy law, they can't make multiple distributions, some now to everyone and then the balance when all of the other legal cases are resolved?

I hope they do make that distribution, so many people have been waiting a long time and it sounds like it's going to take even longer for all these cases to work their way through the courts.
If the court gives him your money, can you sue him?  That would be ridiculous for them to do, but courts sometimes do ridiculous things.

The Pineapple Fund is awesome and shows the great potential to use Bitcoin and cryptoassets for good.  Pine picked great projects that will do a lot of really great things.  I encourage you all to look to the PF website for a lot of great charities.
It is my hope that we build a future with many more generous crypto participants.  This technology, distributed public ledger, offers a whole new way to approach civilization.  More fair, more transparent, and with less wealth disparity.  This is not unrealistic and utopian, it is the inevitable direction of technologies that allow us to build societies around decentralized systems.
It's exciting to have the social and societal attitude, the economics, and the technology come together to enable a better future for all of us.  Starting with Bitcoin, which takes on the biggest stranglehold that has held back humanity, financial institutions, the banksters, the money changers.
The work I do for my organization in our small part of helping to bring this about is the most satisfying work I've done in my life, and I expect it to only improve over time, as adoption grows.

I agree.  There are many people that have made poor decisions.  These people often deserve a second chance.  Many of them become extremely honest people after having had a scrape with the law.
