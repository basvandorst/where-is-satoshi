The good news is that, if you disagree with them, you can make a profit off it.

Being reactive, as opposed to preventing such problems in the first place, isn't a good way of building a reputation.

It's not because miners are dicks. It's an anti-flooding measure to try prevent an attacker from sending a bunch of particularly small transactions that disrupt legitimate business. The fee is only mandatory if you're sending less than 0.01 BTC. At the peak price, that's about $2.65. There aren't many things these days you can get for less than $2.65. Also, the fee works out to about 13c for those tiny transactions.

Netbank, WebBank, and Interbank are already taken.

Interestingly, CampBX uses Dwolla for transfers, but you don't have to undergo additional verification to move $1,000 per day there. This might be because Dwolla itself requires some verification of who you are to use it.

Let's say you have 25 rewards you received, each worth ฿0.0001. Let's label those transactions A through Y. If you try to send someone ฿0.0025, then every one of your inputs will have to be referenced as proof that you have the money. The transaction will then look like this: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY &gt; Z. Since that's a lot of extra data, you'll probably be charged a higher fee for relaying the data. They're not _all_ subject to a separate fee, necessarily, but it's possible you'll have a hard time actually spending it.
If it makes more sense, before Bitcoins became so expensive, a lot of those faucets were paying out ฿0.01 and other useful fractions of BTC. Since the coins are so expensive, they've had to drop payouts to a point where, now, it's little more than a gimmick to make you look at an ad for twenty seconds.

My guess, without seeing any further details: One of those transactions is the change from your original input.
For instance, using arbitrary numbers, let's say you received 1 BTC at some point and you're sending someone else 0.4 BTC. You use that entire coin, sending them 0.4 of it and sending 0.6 back to yourself. This way, everything remains accounted for.

While I'm not sure how much it would help here, the NYSE has a few automatic rules in place to limit panic selling, called [trading curbs or circuit breakers]( If MtGox had similar rules in place people would know that this is coming, rather than panicking at an unexpected market freeze. Adapting those rules slightly for MtGox, since it operates 24/7:
* 10% drop within 24 hours = automatic 1 hour halt
* 20% drop within 24 hours = automatic 2 hour halt
* 30% drop within 24 hours = automatic 12 hour halt

Serious question: Why not? Wouldn't a steady rate of increase like that be sustainable in a way similar to modest inflation?
Just for comparison, the major stock market indices had a pretty similar trendline from the 70s through the 90s, up until the dotcom bubble popped.

Change, potentially. From what I understand (and I sincerely hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong), if _any_ output of the transaction falls below the "dust" threshold, the transaction might not be relayed. So if you have ฿0.01 and send someone ฿0.00999, you may not get your change back and the transaction might not go through at all.

The price has been volatile like that for some time. It did indeed drop from 132 to 128, but now (just two hours later) it's back at 132.

Given your definition of floor, it's obviously at $0.00.
More realistically, looking at the longer-term average, I could see it leveling off at between $15 and $30. That's about where it was three months ago before the latest round of hype and speculation.

Even if you assume the price of a Bitcoin is going to crash, it does make some sense to think in terms of mBTC. At $10 per coin, 1 cent = 1 mBTC, which would remain a useful conversion.

Now you're just being silly. :p

Because it does not contribute to the discussion.

At the current price of US$120, the minimum works out to US$0.006516.
At US$184.16 the minimum equates to a penny.

Sounds too similar to [mmmBop](

It's assumed because, by default, transactions over 0.01 BTC can be passed along with zero transaction fee. Even at the peak price of US$260, any transaction over $2.60 incurs no cost to the buyer or seller, same as cash. A fee can be tacked on (at user discretion) to increase the speed of processing, but right now the network is small and low-volume enough that all transactions are handled near-instantly with no additional charge.
