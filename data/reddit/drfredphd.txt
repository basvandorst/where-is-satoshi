I don't think I'd ever back a project of Amir Taaki

The guy still owes me 100 btc. I will not be doing any business with him and I don't recommend anyone else does either.

Well most phones are still vulnerable to some sort of root exploit anyway (towelroot, framaroot) so installing any untrusted app on a device with a bitcoin wallet is dangerous.

I tried and it doesn't even let me enter a card, says uk cards are not accepted

Was one of the owners of bitcoinica. After the initial 'hack' he leaked the password to their mtgox account causing more money to be lost

I think for a lot of businesses the volatility of bitcoin is a problem in that to mitigate the risk they need to quickly change it to fiat which is going to incur some kind of fee. If this price comes down to match credit card fees it is still less attractive due to the cost of training.
If they could use the bitcoin they took in to pay other expenses it would be more attractive. If chinese companies took bitcoin it could be a different ball game, shame the Chinese government is so against it.

Hi, what methods of transfer do they accept? I couldn't find the info on their site without signing up.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:47:14
If teamviewer's running you can connect to it from anywhere with a master password, this could be compromised in the usual ways.

You do not need anywhere close to 50% to double spend an unconfirmed transcation.

Yeah I use Phoenix. If you're gonna overclock then set the aggression to 7 it doesn't make as much difference. Shouldn't need the worksize command either.

I hope you read up more on bitcoins before you write your paper. Your wallet file doesn't store bitcoins, it stores the keys to the vault your bitcoins are in (the bitcoin address).  The keys would be impossible to forge even with a supercomputer.
It's an oversimplified metaphor, the blockchain is a record of every transaction, so every bitcoin can be assigned to an address.
As for mining I don't know what hardware you have but it could make a difference with regards to the software you need, some are designed for CPU or GPU only.

This would be the 'proper' way to do it. You'll need to be able to forward some ports, and set up a dns service for your computer, and be comfortable using a command prompt. It's not too difficult. It's also not very secure though, an online wallet might be more suitable.

 I have a Raspberry pi model B and bitcoin core works fine, initial sync takes ages. Can't definitively confirm Pi 2 works but shouldn't be a problem.
Armory has a pretty high RAM usage which could potentially cause problems.

They did get off pretty lightly. Could probably have asked for $10,000. I don't think these 'hackers' knew their target, probably a standard trojan.
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:33:33
Which would also be true for a standard international wire or Western Union.

There's a lot of expenses for businesses that handle a lot of cash in Africa.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:44:23
Which is why I'm posting it here. I'm not the only one who got it.

I just got the baitest email from coinbase today. Promises to pay you back 150% of you send up to 60btc to a certain address. But act soon this amazing opportunity only available until end of April.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:56:59
I'd bet the backup was never usable in the first place, and that they'd never tested a restore.
@_date: 2011-10-26 08:22:09
Wasn't it EUR transfers rather than European? Should be fine still.

I use intersango, because they're the only one I found who accept GBP (that wasn't MtGox) also there are no fees at the moment.
@_date: 2011-12-07 10:46:03
You can use them, but you'll have to send US dollars to their international bank account, your bank will probably charge you fees for the conversion and the international transaction.
@_date: 2011-10-28 21:58:08
MtGox accept GBP, I deposited on Thursday night and it still hasn't been credited so I can't vouch for it yet.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:19:02
Yes, this works. You should also make a paper backup to avoid any memory stick related disasters.
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:18:15
It could run it easy enough, you'd need a good 32gb of storage though
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:16:17
Yeah there's a print dialogue although I guess you wouldn't normally bother with a printer in Tails
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:39:12
It's nothing new really. Just going to index sites, doesn't mean they'll be able to search unknown addresses, maybe they could get some data by cross-referencing with clearnet.
