Before I say anything more against DCA, let me make clear that I'm talking about DCA vs. lump-sum-investing. I.e., it's a situation where you have, say, $5000 to invest, and you're thinking about the best strategy to do so. If you just take $100 from your paycheck every week, because that's the money you have available to invest every week: that is completely fine. But that is not DCA (as an investment strategy), it's you lump-sum-investing your available money every week.
So, the reason against DCA is that it's simply not effective and basically just a fallacy. You think you're limiting your "downside risk", but you're just fooling yourself by not investing your money. You take that same downside risk, only later. And if the value of the stock (or whatever) went up in the meantime, that is profit that you lost by holding out. And you *should* expect the stock to go up, otherwise you wouldn't be investing in the first place.
People advocating DCA think that it's a way to soften hard market crashes. But you don't know when and if those will come, so it makes no sense *expecting* them to come in the duration of your DCA-process. 
Last time this topic came up here, someone made a great analogy that I think demonstrates the fallacy behind it well: Say you want to invest $5000 in Google and you decide to DCA in, paying $100 every week for 50 weeks. Everything goes smooth, you invest and invest. Now the 50 weeks are over, you have invested your money, you're happy with your position. Then one morning, your bank calls you, they say they made a mistake and accidently converted all your stock to cash. They give you the option to just convert it back to stock again for the same price, so nothing for you would change. Do you do that, or do you take the money and DCA it back in?

Lol, that is ridiculous. Are you actually rationalizing that a massive hack like this would *increase* the price?
If anything, the hackers could have shorted before the attack. Look at the price drop. 
And removing 120k coins from the market doesn't have anything like the effect on the price as you're imagining. That is less than 3 months of mining (67 days to be exact), even at the halvened rate.

No, it isn't. Selective breeding is selective breeding, genetic modifications means manually and directly altering the genome. It's not less sophisticated tools, it's an entirely different process.

Not sure what you mean with "malformed" addresses, but no, that doesn't happen. Bitcoins can only be send to valid bitcoin addresses. Since litecoin addresses are not valid bitcoin addresses and vice versa, sending between them isn't possible. It's as easy as that.
More specifically, ltc and btc addresses differ in their version number. Before it is base58 encoded, that's "00" for the bitcoin mainnet, which results in btc addresses (=base58) starting with "1".
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:32:16

No, gold and crypto are not fiat. That is by definition.


Do you know what the word 'decree' means? It doesn't seem like it.
Fiat is fiat because a higher power (like a state) **decrees** that it has to have value, the higher power **forces** you to accept it to have value (specifically by forcing you by law to accept it to settle debts etc). Nobody does that for gold or crypto, which is exactly why they are by definition not fiat.
Gold and coconuts in your example are the same in that nobody forces a value on them, maybe a coconut is more valuable to you on your island than an ounce of gold, that's fine. If people still think it has a higher value, it is not by decree, but by general agreement.

Buy bitcoins for $1 trillion and you'll know. "$1 trillion / current_exchange_rate" as you seem to be implicating is obviously not the correct answer. 
Someone definitely *could* buy bitcoins for $1 trillion, dramatically increasing the exchange rate in the process. And when he has his coins, he could send $1 trillion worth of coins to someone else, because the new (much higher) price would allow that. 
Whether the receiving partner could then *sell* the coins back to the market for $1 trillion is a different question, but he still got $1 trillion worth of bitcoins, according to that current exchange rate.

Not really though. The way I see it, non-standard tx don't get relayed by any regular nodes, so they don't even reach a miner. Only if your tx finds a non-standard-accepting route through the network to a non-standard-accepting miner.

No shit, thanks for putting that in all caps. I assume now this is a contract too and I'm legally obliged to mow your lawn?

The problem is still, what block size translates to what optimal interval? Also, block size is not the only variable. Network propagation is mostly an issue about participants' bandwith. The bitcoin software has no safe way of knowing how fast blocks of a given size propagate. If we all have super-duper broadband with a gajillion terrabyte per second in a few decades, the old rules wouldn't apply.
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:49:53
I have no fucking clue why some people here are telling you stuff like "theoretically, yes blahblah".
The answer is **no**. Coins that are lost are lost forever and they are not in any way redistributed to the remaining people.
And if you want to ask whether the **value** of the remaining coins goes up (you talk about the *amount* in the title, then about *value* in the first paragraph, then it seems to be the *amount* again in that math formula thingy), the answer right now is also **no**. 
Aside from the fact that nobody knows how many coins are lost, there are *way* more new coins introduced into the system through mining than are lost, and this will stay true for many more years to come. So lost coins don't create any noticeable upward pressure on the value of the other coins. When near all bitcoins are mined, in lets say 20 years, this will become true however, and we will enter into the true deflationary stage of bitcoin.

With "web account" you mean on the exchange? When you tell them to pay out, it depends on the exchange when they pay out. It usually takes from instant to a an hour or so, really depends on the exchange. When they pay out, the bitcoin transaction is there pretty much instantly. And then confirmed after 10 minutes (on average).


Yeah that's instant, if you sell into a bid order. See, there are always two "fronts" on an exchange. There is someone saying: "I'm willing to pay $800 for 1 btc" (that's a **bid**) and there is someone else saying "I'm willing to sell my 1 btc for $805" (that's an **ask**). Now if you come to the exchange with your bitcoin, you can either sell it to the bid (and have the money instantly), or try to offer an ask yourself and hope that someone takes it. That's the way exchanges work.


Yeah, they wire money to your bank. Took about 3 or 4 days for me in Europe (SEPA transfer).

You generally shouldn't send out private keys, encrypted or not. Should be fine though as long as you used a relatively safe password. Bruteforcing BIP-38 takes forever, but if your password is "password123", it's still feasible.
I wouldn't worry about the rest of your concerns. Just try it out with a private key that you just printed out and don't have carved in aluminium. Or if you *really* want to make sure that **this** one works, just try that out with your offline LiveCD/Bitaddress. Where's the problem?

The merchants accept Bitcoin the payment system. They don't accept bitcoin the currency.
The thing is that acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment system helps give bitcoin the currency its value.


Yeah, isn't that great? Accept a superior payment system with 0 risk!
BitPay/Coinbase offer the needed solution in the transition state we're in. Once a big enough consensus, usage and stability exists in Bitcoin, and closed loop economies really start to form, companies will start to wonder why they even exchange Bitcoin back to fiat. They will start to keep parts of their revenue in bitcoin to pay their suppliers. Etc, etc. 
I just love every Bitcoin-Troll demonstrating their shortsightedness when going "nuh uuuuh, they don't *reaaaally* except Bitcoin". Only in their limited imagination was it ever the Bitcoiners' idea that the whole world would just immediately turn to a Bitcoin economy.

Stop generalizing. I don't do that.


First of all, who says I want this? So far I'm merely explaining to you why you are wrong in saying that it's not decentralized only because the asset that is traded (decentralized) is about a centralized company.
And the reason to do it is, among others, to allow anyone to trade the stock without having to go through any hurdles. Like living in a specific country for example.
If bitpay were to do this (they obviously won't because they have no reason to), they could set up a colored coin and sell it in an IPO. Then they pay out dividends periodically according to their profits, proportionally, to all the addresses that currently hold the colored coins. People can then trade these colored coins and receive the dividends, completely decentralized and anonymous.

No, you dumb twat. That is not what I'm saying. That is exactly the fucking opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying there needs to be a trade for there to be a price. You are saying the price is magically ZERO when there is no exchange of goods at all. That is complete and utter bullshit. The price is only zero when there are free bitcoins available and literally NO ONE is willing to take them for (infinitely little above) free. And both of those conditions are never going to happen.


There is no irony there, you fucking idiot. What has the price going down even to do with anything?! Do you even hear yourself talk? Am I somehow denying that the price can go down?

Not stupid at all. I don't believe Gox is insolvent, that's crazy talk imo. (edit: I'm actually growing less and less sure that it's crazy though)
The only reason I didn't do the same as you is that I was afraid that they would resolve the withdrawal issue while my money was on its way. If that were the case, the price would have shot back up over Bitstamp level immediately, and since Gox is a fiat death trap, I'd be forced to buy expensive goxBTC to get my money out.

Thanks for clarifying this. But I think you didn't get my point. What I'm saying is that doing it in one coinbase (generation) transaction is very bad and doesn't scale. It means that the generation transaction is **huge** and takes up a lot of space in the already limited blocksize. If every miner out there was to use P2Pool (which is what you'd want, no?), the blockchain would get bloated like crazy.

Of course consumers want a system where they can exploit businesses. Oh and scammers and fraudsters, they really love that too! 
Having fraud protection on the sellers side makes A LOT more sense. Businesses depend on reputation, they can't scam continuesly without it becoming public very fast. Consumers (hackers, identify thieves) on the other hand can scam one business after the other and businesses can't even do anything to protect themselves since privacy rules forbid them from sharing reputation data about their customers (which on its own is a good thing of course) 
Also, this:

Resistance is not a binary state. Your clothing can be more fire resistant than a cotton t-shirt, but that doesn't mean you can jump into a volcano with it. In the same way, algorithms can be *more* ASIC resistant than others, meaning the additional efficiency gained by putting it into an ASIC is lower. With bitcoin, that additional ASIC efficiency was a factor in the tens of thousands. Coins using different methods might only see an efficiency boost like 10x.

Commonplace in contracts, yes, sure.
The ToS of a website? Not so much.
But again, even in the case of a well formulated contract which is notarially certified and sealed with blood, that doesn't rule out liability in case of *fraud* by one of the parties. 
The only question is whether said fraud can be proven. But if there was fraud, it's a crime.
Is your argumentation really that Karpeles could just at any point in time have taken all the coins from the exchange and gone "haha look at the ToS you said it's ok"? And that he'd just get away with that, because according to you, such a "contract" is perfectly legal?

No... the transactions are on the blockchain.
What we're talking about here is just metadata for the coin. The location for this information is in the blockchain, but not the information itself. This does not affect the coin operating decentralized in any way.

Basically, yeah. That's something different from what you said in the title though, "that over $525 million been directly invested in BTC in the last year", which is not true. Or maybe it's true, but that deduction is not right. Just because coins were mined, doesn't mean someone paid fiat for them (yet).
Also, keep in mind that $500m over a year is **nothing** for a currency - especially a global one at that.

First of all, those were zero-confirmation double spends, which makes it relatively easy. Zero-confirmation means the money isn't actually considered spent by the network, the transaction is not in a block yet. A zero-confirmation double spend can work even if you have absolutely no hashrate. One way you can accomplish it is a propagation race: you want to trick a merchant into selling you something, so you send a transaction that pays him, but immediately send another transaction that pays the same amount to you. Both transactions propagate through the network, and you want it so that the merchant sees the first transaction first, but the miner who will solve the next block sees the other one first. The miner will then take *that* transaction into the next block and make it valid. The transaction that the merchant thought was your payment to him, is now considered a double spend and invalid and the merchant is screwed.
Now, what GHash (allegedly) did is different: They **have** the hashing power, so on blocks that they mine themselves, they can freely choose whether to include a transaction that pays the other side, or sign another one and put that one in.  
So they first send a transaction to Betcoin (gambling site). If another pool/miner solves the next block, they just let the payment be. They gamble the money with a near 50/50 chance on the site, it's not really a big problem. But if the next block is their's, it contains a transaction that differs from the payment that they sent out before - they send it to themselves. They have thus gambled for free.  
(I have to say here that I'm not too sure that this is exactly how they did it, but they could have done it that way and it probably was similar)
The real problem here is simply that Betcoin accepts zero-confirmation payments and immediately sends out rewards for that. That is something you cannot do. It's amateurish and stupid and they would have been exploited sooner or later anyway. Those transcations are not **zero** confirmation for no reason. They are not confirmed and are thus not valid payments.
You can accept a zero confirmation tx for a lot of things. If you're Amazon and someone orders from you, there's no problem in accepting 0 conf. By the time you send out any product, you will know whether there was a double spend. Or if the money is for a porn subscription, fine. Because if it turns out to be a double spend, you can just deactivate the account again. But you just cannot accept 0 conf for *irreversible, immediate* stuff, like paying out gambling winnings.
Now, whether GHash did the right thing in exploiting that is a different chapter. Like I indicated before, Betcoin kind of deserved it and you could write it off as teaching them a valuable lesson in Bitcoin security. The other argument for that is that sites like Betcoin or Satoshidice are hated by many Bitcoiners because of the insane amount of blockchain spam they produce. Maybe it was GHash's way of giving them a big "fuck you". Anyway, I'd agree that it's definitely very shady that GHash used their powers like this and deliberately put effort into it. We should not forget about that in the future. I wouldn't trust them.
But it's an entirely different thing to do a proper double spend, one where the transaction has actually been confirmed. And there's no reasonable case where they would do that, even if they had 50+% of the network. It would be suicide. And very likely not worth the one time chance they'd have for that. You have to keep in mind that you need another side that you can fraud with the double spend. And to be worth it, it would definitely need to be a transaction in the $millions worth.
I don't know if any of that made sense, but maybe it clears some things up. And sorry for the bad english.

But he can! He can own bitcoin very well without any computer, he'll just have trouble actually using it. But you don't need a computer to *own* bitcoin.
Think of bitcoins as gold coins in a box that sit on the internet. The box is indestructible and secured by an inpenetrable lock for which you need a key. 
Everybody can see and get to the box, but again, you need a key to open it. Since no one can ever break the lock, we can safely say that whoever owns the key, owns the gold.
In this analogy, the box is a bitcoin address, and the key is a "private key" to that address.
Since the key is just a bunch of letters and numbers, you can just write it down or print it on paper, and "own" the bitcoin on the corresponding address without any electronic wallet whatsoever.
Check out  It will create a bitcoin address for your friend and the corresponding private key. If you send bitcoin to this address and make sure your friend is the only person who has the private key, then he's good to go.
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:06:18
You are correct.
That's why the only "real" danger is when one entity has 50%+ of the hashing power. In that case, they can double spend, and since they are faster on average than the rest of the network, will always beat it eventually in the race.

The point is achieving a fair distribution of initial currency, something which every coin has problems with. By having people destroy something which holds value you make sure that nobody profits unfairly. What it does is essentially converting your btc into xcp.
Yes, nobody guarantees that 1 btc that you convert to xcp this way will later still be worth 1 btc. But that's true for everything. If you convert 1 bitcoin into litecoin, nobody can guarantee you the same.

For **now**, yes sure. But the energy use in bitcoin is a direct result of its price. We're still far from an equilibrium of btc-price&lt;-&gt;energy cost due to the introduction of ASICs, so energy use is still rising *very fast* at the moment. And when that equilibrium is reached, you have to keep in mind that it keeps rising proportionally with the price. Every 10x increase in bitcoin valuation results eventually in a 10x increase in energy consumption.

That's my point, because that's not the way it works. The information is not just encoded in **matter**, it is encoded in **charge**. A dead brain isn't like a computer turned off in hibernate mode that you just turn on again and then it goes through some booting routine and the information gets written back from harddrive to RAM. When you die, the RAM, the charge-state of your brain, disappears, that means all the information that makes up your mind.
If you were to ever be able to create a living human out of a dead brain, it would be by setting the brain to some specific charge state (let's say by nano robots or whatever). But that state would not produce **you**, it would produce an entirely different consciousness that is only living in the same brain as you lived before. Because you are not your brain, you are the specific charge state *in* your brain. And the information about that charge state is irrevocably lost on death.

OK, you're right, in this example it's done by brute force and that would obviously not work with a private key. But there are other ways imaginable. Find out what algorithm blurred it, find out how to reverse it.. *or something like that*, it doesn't matter.
When you post a blurred text, the information that you want to hide is still there, it's just distorted. But when you simply draw a big black line over it (which is also a lot easier than blurring it), the information is destroyed, and **that** should be your goal.
My point is that there's absolutely no reason to even slightly open yourself up to any attack vectors. If there's information in a picture that you don't want to be in that picture, you take the information out, you don't make it "harder to see".

No, thank you. There's nothing erroneous about it.
See [here]( When we say "hard fork", we mean a change to the bitcoin software that isn't backwards compatible. We don't mean a blockchain fork. A blockchain fork is what *happens* when multiple parties use different incompatible versions of the software. It is what *can* be the result of doing a hard fork.
Of course miners aren't "irrelevant" overall. But they are irrelevant for the acceptance of the software. First comes acceptance by people, then the miners mine what is accepted (because it is profitable).

Your question kind of answers itself. If your opinion is that Bitcoin "most probably will succeed", and you have given just a bit of thought to how much it will be worth if that happens, then your opinion can't be that the price is too high. Since you assign a &gt;50% chance of it succeeding, that means the price is too little, by orders of magnitude.
The price is only too high if the chance that Bitcoin fails outweighs the potential return. Whether that is the case, everybody has to decide for themselves.

We're still on a heavy production schedule, adding 3600 bitcoin to the economy every day.
But in the future (decades from now), yes, this will be the endgame. 
You must consider that the more the whole technology grows and the further bitcoin spreads, the amount of coins lost will decrease, and in theory, the value of the rest will increase accordingly. 
So losing 1 BTC today would not matter that much, but losing 1 BTC when a good amount of coins has already been lost would mean a lot more - *and is therefore way less likely to happen*. Smaller and smaller amounts would be lost. 
And for the whole thing to work, it's not really important how many are actually left. If there's just one bitcoin left for the whole world, people would just use smaller denominations for it. Bitcoins are infinitely divisible.

The blockchain only stores the URL to the metadata, and that URL and what awaits there can be anything you want.
Look at [this bitcoin transaction]( that I used to issue a colored coin. If you look at the raw output scripts (bottom of the page), you can see the url  in there. And that URL doesn't have to be from coinprisms servers, it can be just any URL.
Coinprism also lets you set the URL for the metadata when you create a colored coin via their site, see here: 
Serious colored coins (like a company selling shares) would probably be best advised to store their metadata on their own servers. 
But the coin itself doesn't really care about the metadata, it works without them anyway. It's just a way to provide information about the coin.

I'm sorry, but this is wrong, and keeping to spread this misinformation is also wrong.
0 confirmation means exactly that, you have ZERO confirmation that this is a real payment. It's not "you can be 99.9% sure". Aside from an actual deliberate double spend, there can be a number of reasons why a transaction doesn't get confirmed. Happens all the time.
Bitcoin is not meant to be used like this, the confirmations are there for a reason. It's not currently very useful in PoS sales like this, except when the merchant uses something like Bitpay (= someone whose business involves to cover the risk of 0 conf for you).

If it was just the matching for different currencies like I suspected, "only selling" wouldn't make sense. There would always occur 1 buy in 1 currency matched exactly against a sale in another. But I have done *zero* research regarding this, it was just a speculation from what OP said. 
If it is actually MtGox engaging in insider trading on their own platform across their different currencies, then yes, I'd find that suspicious as a possible reason for their fuck-up.


A bitcoin exchange is a platform where other parties exchange bitcoins. You are implying that a bitcoin exchange is also a bitcoin trader. Those two are completely different things. I don't think Gox ever said they were actually in the trading business.

That is correct. But why is that a bad thing? The "natural zero-risk return on doing nothing" is not supposed to be so high as to completely discourage work. And if it became that way, it wouldn't be sustainable and adjust itself. Not even speaking about the fact that people are naturally greedy and will always look to increase their wealth as much as possible.
People like to argue that in a deflationary environment, people wouldn't spend anything and hoard their money instead, leading to a deflationary spiral where the money's value trends towards infinity. But in the same way, from an outside perspective, someone could predict the opposite behavior for the inflationary economy we live in. Since we know that the money is going to be worth less, we would obviously just spent it all as fast as possible, creating an inflationary spiral, trending the value towards zero. -- That's just not the way reality works.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:07:10
Yeah, except that is just as impossible. Do you think it's in any way possible for parents to control all their children's internet access? When I was younger, my parents tried, at least a bit, but you think I had any problems accessing porn? Do you think today's youth has? Does literally *any* 13 year old boy have any problems getting porn? There's just nothing parents can do about that.
But you know what I couldn't do when I was 13? Gamble my allowance away on the internet. But now you can, easily. And you don't even do it with "actual money". You do it with Bitcoin, or Dogecoin. A playful introduction to a very dangerous lifestyle. 
My original post wasn't going for any "solution" to this problem, all I wanted to express was that I felt bad about the situation, the way it is. I know it's not going to change much in any way. Take it just as me being cynical.
But just directing all responsibility to the parents in this matter is just as irresponsible and impossible a solution as saying it should all be controlled on the server side. It's just taking a very convenient, easy road in this complicated issue, one that simply doesn't work.

I made a similar call once a few months ago when I was angry. Had the coins on just-dice (invested), so I didn't really have the forced think-it-through time waiting for confirmations. I got lucky and won (10 BTC on 50/50). But even right afterwards, I knew how fucking retarded doing that was and that I wouldn't do it ever again. 
The joy of winning simply doesn't match the pain of losing. If you win, you're happy for a few hours, maybe a day. The satisfaction doesn't stick, especially since it's no accomplishment, it's just luck. You can't tell yourself "wow you really did great there". 
But if you lose, it'll hurt for a long time, because then you can see that it was completely your fault. Then it wasn't just bad luck, it was the stupidity of the decision itself.

It was the initial plan for XCP to do it that way, but mining pools could have abused that to produce infinite XCP for themselves this way (since they'd pay the miner fees to themselves, they could just "burn" it again and again and again).

A lot of miners will have to turn of their machines, if the price hasn't increased drastically by that point, or coincidentally increases (= at least doubles) shortly after the halving.
I don't see much logic in the argument that the price *has to* increase because the mining reward is halved. That's wishful thinking. "Supply is lower so price goes up" doesn't make sense: the total supply isn't lower, it's still increasing, only increasing slower. For the price to go up, demand/adoption still has to outpace the mining.

With staggering limitations though. If you really think the Bitcoin code is "fluid and adaptable", you need to think again. Every serious change is discussed to death before anything happens. Which on the one hand is a good thing (you want to be safe &amp; secure), on the other it slows progress *immensly*.
If a single person or small group was in charge alone, they might have said a long time ago "OK, sure, 5 minutes block time is plenty enough, we reduce it to that, reducing variance for miners." or they might also have said "Yeah, that brutal block halving every 4 years is an insane unnecessary blow to the economy. That shouldn't be there, let's just replace it with a function that calculates block rewards gradually declining as we go." 
Obvious stuff like this. Could be implemented in 20 minutes. No negative repercussions (that I know of). Does it happen? Nope. Not until there is some catastrophic event that forces the change. Because a hard fork is simply considered too risky at this point and won't happen unless absolutely necessary. And I'm not even talking about the changes that spark serious discussion, like changing the PoW function, implementing Block-Trees or anything like that.

No it won't. Bitcoin has actually never been inflationary for very long. 
Since I understand that you (wrongly) say inflation when you mean monetary expansion, that won't effectively happen for that long either. Like the other commenter said, 99% are mined in the next 15 years. There will be a point where the coins mined are less than the coins lost or destroyed. And that won't take 100 years.

When you "own" bitcoin, that means you are the only person that has the private key to control a certain unspent bitcoin output.
It's more of a methaphorical "owning", because the bitcoins you own are never in your pocket, or on your computer, or anywhere, really. All you can ever "own" is the ability to control the bitcoin, because the bitcoin itself are only hypothetical constructs in the publicly shared database that we call the blockchain.

Do you actually think that such a decision would depend on whether they made some lousy $25 million before making it illegal? That's not the kind of money they actually give a crap about. If they wanted to "make Bitcoin illegal" (that idea is ridiculous), they would do it either way.
And for being bullish about this: I have mixed feelings. On one side it's good if they sell them as soon as possible. But on the other side, I think some of you are underestimating what such huge amounts of coin thrown onto the market could do to the price. These first 29k now might even be comparably fine, but there's still what, about 140k(?) from DPR that will end up on the market when he goes to jail for good (which is to be expected).
Really, I would just hope they lose the goddamn private key. Or DPR or some insider becomes a hero and moves the coin to an inaccessible address somehow, effectively destroying it. Please?

The network decides on a valid blockchain basically by saying "the longest valid blockchain is the right one". If there is a player that can build blocks faster than the rest, he doesn't need to care if anyone builds a block before him, or 2, or 6. He knows he can build them faster, so just keeps building them until his blockchain is the longest again. So much for the theory at least.

Registering and using fixed addresses is not using Bitcoin correctly. You're actually supposed to never reuse addresses, for privacy, but also security reasons. HD wallets (= all addresses are derived from a single seed in some way) could solve this and they could register *that* in some way. But I really don't see why. As a business, you don't have to give governments complete oversight over your books now either, you have to report what concerns them.

I have already laid out the incentives that speak against miners just doing that. It's really classic tragedy of the commons: Everybody knows it's bad if they all stay on course, but they know that if they don't keep exploiting, someone else will.
Sure, we can *hope* that miners will act against their own direct short-term profit interests and in a more sustainable, long-term interest, but history has shown that this isn't even that likely.


This is not about making money. It's much more about the possibility of an external force. If they have this much hashing power and a government comes along and *forces* them to do shit that undermines or even kills Bitcoin, *that's* the big risk here. It is the main reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place, to get rid of this systemic threat.
E-Gold didn't have any reason to misbehave either, nor did Liberty Reserve. A government came along because they didn't like what they were doing, yelled "money laundering" and "terrorism" at them, and just *stopped* them. The big point of Bitcoin is that this isn't supposed to be **possible** here.

Yes, I mean there is no upper bound stopping to "over-secure" the network. It's a **long** time (especially in Bitcoin-time) until only fees remain. If price goes balistic in the meantime, so will network security, even though it might be completely unnecessary. 
That effect might very well reverse when rewards go down and end in tragedy of the commons. But again, that's decades away. If Bitcoin price appreciation continues like it has before, I suppose we would run into over-securing and massive energy waste way before we run into TOTC.

Well, did you read his post? He said:


Which is true and makes your example completely invalid. 
The advantage of the blockchain is that it removes the need for a central authority. It accomplishes that, which is amazing, but it does so being waaaaay slower and less efficient compared to any decent centralized solution.
If the bank is the central authority that you have to trust anyway to hold their promises of giving you something for the units in their blockchain, you don't need a blockchain. That would just be inefficient and useless.
So no, you can't decouple the blockchain from the currency. Either the tokens in the blockchain are worth something on their own, *independent of a central authority saying so*, or the blockchain is pointless. That's also where a lot of altcoin schemes fall apart that try to peg their value to gold or other silly stuff like that.

The hope is that they serve enough as a bridge so that Bitcoin adoption grows. At some point, companies, out of sheer financial interest, will cut the pointless Bitpay connection.
If company A gets its supplies by companies B and C, and at one point they all accept Bitcoin via Bitpay, then company A will eventually just accept Bitcoin directly (or to a large degree), even if it's just to save the Bitpay fee and make use of Bitcoin's cheap transactional properties.
The same thing will then continue down the supply chain until everyone everywhere can just accept BTC directly. At least that's the dream.

I don't remember them making Bitcoin illegal, or having any serious plans to do that in any way.


It's trivial when deciding whether to make something illegal. Also mainly because it's not such an oiled machine as some people want to think when they make up their weird conspiracy theories. The "government" is a huge machine consisting of many independent parts. The parts who'd go for making Bitcoin illegal have nothing to do with the parts who go after drug money and related assets and sell them as a result.
I don't know what you're imagining how that would go down. Important figures of the legislature, meeting in dark backrooms with the FED and making evil plans about how they can sell the BTC to their people and then make it illegal right afterwards? And then they go all [*muaharharharharharhar*](

Isn't that inherently impossible?
"Thousands of numbers" isn't enough. To verify the randomness, you would need to have a dataset of a size multiple times the search space. 
For example: to verify the randomness of a 6-sided die, you would need to roll it 6*n times, with a higher n giving more confidence. If you rolled it just 3 times, you'd have absolutely no idea if it's normally distributed or not.
But here, it's not 6, it's 2^256, and just creating that many "rolls" is impossible (otherwise bitcoin wouldn't be safe in the first place).

I'm saying that nobody in their right mind would/should just resend payments automatically only because they **don't** see the tx id in a block. That was the assertion of :


And I just meant to say that nobody who isn't a complete idiot would make such accounting code. It would be abusable in a lot of ways, malleability just being one of them.
No code should just assume "oh woops, I guess that tx just disappeared" and resend automatically, based on flimsy information like "not seeing the tx id anymore".

It's not a 51% issue or that you have to have a certain part of the network. Say the network has 1000 nodes total, and you provide 100. The network works with 3x redundancy, that means the data gets saved on 3 different nodes. With 100 of 1000 nodes, you have roughly 0.1% chance of all 3 copies landing in your 100 nodes. So about every thousandth file, (or blob of data or however they're handling it) would end up only backuped on your nodes. And when you then decide to shut them down, the data is gone.
This is just my gut understanding though. I can't say I've spent too much time digging into how storj tries to battle stuff like this.

Multiple copies of that sheet of paper, yeah, I would.
There is absolutely no way that paper magically rots away suddenly before you'd notice. That's just paranoid. There are books that are hundreds of years old. On the chance that it really starts to fade if you actually managed to never sweep the BTC for many years, you would notice in the meantime and just make a new paper.
And the other stuff about burning, moths, "eaten by pests" etc is easily answered by the obvious solution that you would make multiple copies.
Trusting your brain to not forget 12 very specific words is a lot riskier, no doubt. You're seriously trusting yourself that the 12 words that you memorize now, you would still remember even if you were to never touch the BTC for a long, long, long time?

Think about this: If we were using a deflationary currency now, and someone would come along with the idea of using an inflationary one, you might say: "Why would anyone ever want or hold any of that? It's guaranteed to devalue over time, so the smart thing for everyone to do is to get rid of it right when they get it. Since nobody would want to hold such a currency, it would never be used. Silly idea."
But here we are, using it, paradox and stupid as it may seem.
Bitcoin is just the opposite of that, instead of slight (sometimes, not so slight) inflation of fiat, you have a slight (sometimes, not so slight) deflation by lost coins. The difference is that in the first one, there are central institutions that directly profit off controlling the money supply this way. They have an unfair, unjustifiable advantage by being able to make money out of thin air. Even if you don't think they are inherently evil, they make decisions of which they can't possibly foresee the consequences. They are like weathermen, trying to accurately predict the temperature right on the degree, but not just for the next week, but for the next few years. This is power that should not be in the hands of mere mortals, who, seriously, have no idea what they are doing.


Nobody is making claims this will better. Maybe some here are, but then they are wrong. The rich will be rich, and the rich will fuck the poor. This is how it was, and how it'll always be. Bitcoin doesn't make any claims of changing that. But it can level the field. What bitcoin does, among other things, is decentralize the *creation* of money, by making it a fair process in which everybody can participate.

Not running away with the money only makes sense if you expect the future profit to be bigger than what you can steal now.

Well, I hope you're right, though I have my doubts. Maybe the rightful owner has the coins himself from shady sources, as is often the case with Bitcoin. Most of my coins come from investing in gambling sites and bitcoin securities last year, both of which would probably be enough of a gray area, if not entirely illegal, to deny returning the coins.
Anyway, I disagree that in either case (with any asset forfeiture for that matter), the government has any claim on the money. Maybe a bit of an extreme view, but I just don't see it as ethically correct. So it's drug money, we say that's bad. How is it then OK for the government to get it and magically clean the evil money of all its sin?

What "for the most part"? How does **the system** check that? What keeps me from becoming a masternode (or rather, a hundred masternodes) , taking in 20% of the block rewards, but not actually doing anything a node is supposed to do? Hint: nothing. 
This is just the basic Sybill attack problem all over again.  And all they do with requiring 1000 drk for the masternodes is saying "OK, now only rich people can abuse the system", which is no solution, it only makes it worse. 


Whenever they want, they can take their 1000 drk back to the market like everyone else. Those coins are not "off the market", just like the ones in your pocket are not. Only that the ones in your pocket don't net you a passive income.

Well, agreed, they should *let* you do it if you *really* want, but warn you. The thing is that transactions that break these rules are usually never picked up, because the reference implementation forbids it. So it really doesn't make much sense to send low priority transactions without fee.

For something like Megaupload, decentralization makes sense, I agree. That falls under the "sharing files of possibly illegal nature" of my original post. But I don't think storj and this kind of cloud hosting is intended for file **sharing**. It's for storage, backup etc.


The paper talks about "Google Attacks" where someone basically tries to outperform the rest of the network in space. Their argument there is pretty weak on its own, because they seem to just assume that the whole world will automatically and immediately serve them all unused computer space:


the average consumers computers. Our research shows that  gure to be about
250,000 PB. Thus, even if Google suspended all of its services to attack
the network, it would not be possible to outperform the resources provided by
user space.
But that was not my point anyway. You don't need someone having more space than the rest of the network. You just need someone creating many nodes; those nodes can have very little storage space each.

No, it isn't. The 12 million existing coin is spread a lot wider and the distribution was in a fair process that went over **years** and still is only finished half.
Of course there is some (actually a lot of) concentration, especially in the very early adopters pockets, but that just stands in no comparison to just selling the whole supply for 21 btc in one go. 
With NXT, you have someone who paid 1 btc 2 months ago, gets 47 million NXT. And according to the market price, those 47 million would be worth 4000 BTC now. Do you actually think that's possible? That this new thing that nobody uses has a legitimate 400000% return in 2 months?
I'm not saying the whole thing is intended as a scam, or that it will go belly up within the next weeks, but if you're counting on an increase in price from the insane price that it has now, I suggest you count again.

Ah, I remember that. It was a stupid bet to make, I said the same back then. I think it's more likely that an altcoin takes over before you'd get enough consensus in bitcoin to do such a drastic change.
But to be honest, I agree with him that we should be using another, more "ASIC-proof" algo - but this creates other problems like abuse by botnets and attacks by entities with large computing power. So, meh... 
A change to the fundamentals of Bitcoin that I find more important and a no-brainer would be to get rid of the brutal block halving Bitcoin has, and replace it with gradually declining block rewards. But likewise, this will probably not happen.

Don't you worry about that.


This is supposed to be a global currency, and the so called "IPO" got less than $20k. That's the time when you should say "OK, shit, that didn't work, we need to stop this project."


This is not early investors earning a profit. This is early investors having **everything** and you having **nothing**. And there not being any additional minting, so that fact **never** changes. The people with their gazillion of NXT just sit on it and get richer by "forging" (Jesus..).
There is maybe 1 million NXT in actual circulation, being traded. And there's 999 milllion NXT that are just waiting to be dumped. It's bullshit.
With Bitcoin, there's a smart system behind it that avoides all this shit. And NXT just threw that smart system over board and tries to sell that as something positive.

There is no doubt it was below market. The question is, how far below market? For the lowest bidders, it might have been substantially lower. You have to keep in mind that there could be a huge spread among the 120 different bidders of the syndicate. 
The actual bid by secondmarket would be the weighted average of those bids (split up in 5k chunks).

Says who? It's got some pretty good traction now and it is hardly more than what you call a "novel asset class". 
Hell, I wouldn't even call Bitcoin a currency at all. It is Bitcoin, *it is what it is*. And people will make of it what they make of it. I'm perfectly fine with Bitcoin just being a "Gold 2.0" - a scarce unforgeable asset that can be accessed and transferred globally within seconds. That's pretty solid on its own. And if it ever gets to the point where people accept it that way, the "currency" aspect will evolve naturally. Or maybe not, it doesn't matter. But it will definitely not be because people think they *have to* use it that way.

An open source software that does what BitPay does, for free. 
So I mean managing receiving addresses and exchange API keys in such a way that receiving payment on an address moves the coins to an exchange and triggers the sale there, automatically.

Might require shop owners to keep a small bitcoin balance on the exchange as a buffer to bridge the gap between coin transactions, but otherwise it should work fine.

Arbitrage. This happens on a global scale all the time. There are people who do nothing else for a living but do arbitrage trading.
The difficult thing is that you need to move money across borders as fast as possible. Bitcoins move fast, but you need the fiat money to buy the Coin in the right place. So if right now Bitcoin is cheaper in Turkey than in the U.S. you could buy there and sell in the U.S., but then you have dollars that you need to move back to Turkey to do the trade again. That creates friction which sometimes is the reason why differences in price can hold on for quite some time.
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:59:07
Thanks, at least one person here is up to talk about this and doesn't just downvote and run.


This would still hold true for a gradually declining reward, in fact, even more so. The same number of coins would be mined per 4-year-period. More coins in the beginning, less at the end.


Except there's not really much to prepare for. It's just this sudden event, however expected it is, that turns everything upside down.
The current situation is that difficulty rises exponentially while everyone tries to rush in before the reward drops. We can reasonably expect that at some point, we'll reach an equilibrium, where mining is barely profitable. Everyone tries to milk the cow as hard as it gets. And then, from one day to the next, it's suddenly not profitable anymore for *anyone*, difficulty drops like a rock, huge amounts of now useless hardware stand still.
The moment the halving occurs, the whole mining industry, and consequently, a big part of the bitcoin economy, is shaken. If the price doesn't immediately double, half the miners would drop out (if behaving rationally), increasing confirmation times etc. It creates a blow to the economy that doesn't need to happen. Of course lots of miners wouldn't actually drop out, since why should they and not the others? The result, as I expect it, is chaos. Definitely doesn't seem healthy to me.
Sure, it can be argued that price would make up for all of this, but can we expect that to go on forever? You say "lowering the reward encourages value", but I'm not sure that follows. Mining follows price, not price mining. When 75% of all coins have already been mined by the next halving, why would the halving still have a big effect on the price? 3/4th of the supply is already out there.


Why not? We have a constantly changing block reward anyway (based on fees). What speaks against a slowly declining reward? You have a much smoother transition, allowing everyone to adjust while it happens. Less chaos, more stability.

That can be determined freely. Are you really saying that if there is small, zero-risk growth of value, then no investment makes sense and everybody would descend into some sort of economic nihilism?
If you have $1 now, and are near 100% sure it will be worth $1.01 in a year, and I come and offer you an investment possibility that offers you to triple your money, but has a 5% chance of loss, you'd say "Nah, I'll stick with my 1% yearly deflation, thank you very much"? That would not be rational in any way.
And to come back to the original point, there is no "literally zero risk wealth growth" like you claim there is. Of course there's risk. Say this dangerous deflationary trap would stop economic growth, then that would in turn stop/slow the deflationary process. If there is no economic growth, there's also no natural deflation.

If we were forcing someone, it would be correct to stop it. But nobody is forcing anyone here.


It is indeed very simple. And wrong and stupid.
When was the last time someone forced you with a gun to use the US dollar? There is no law that forbids other currencies to be used. The U.S. dollar **has** to be accepted as currency. But that doesn't mean others can't. And again, the "army" has as much to do with that as it has with you not being allowed to cross the street when the lights are red.

Doesn't P2P create a scaling problem with the way it handles the coinbase transaction? If everybody was to mine on P2P, wouldn't that create huge transactions in every single block, just to distribute the block reward?
Take [this P2P block]( for example. **14.7kb size for the coinbase transaction alone.** 
P2P currently holds about 1-2% of the total hashing power. So if P2P would manage 100% and the miners were evenly distributed, we'd need over 50x, that's over 700kb, for the coinbase transaction in this block alone.
Centralized mining pools are bad, but they allow handling this stuff off-chain, which doesn't create such a huge overhead when splitting up the 25 BTC into thousands of tiny pieces.
Please correct me if I'm wrong or if there's a solution for that.

No, that doesn't work. If it did, you wouldn't send it to another pool, you would just send the whole 25 BTC to yourself ;)
To be more specific, the reason why it doesn't work is that when mining, you basically build a hash of the content of the block. That block you're hashing and trying to find a valid solution for already contains the coinbase transaction (= the transaction that creates 25 BTC + fees to the pool's address). If you were to change the coinbase address, the hash would be different and your solution wouldn't be valid anymore.

Yeah, and my point is that even if there are a *lot* of non-random appearing sequences, it's not possible to have created one deliberately or by random chance. *A lot* here is still way too little. It still makes up so little of the total cake that it just doesn't happen by chance.
I'd wager all my coins that in all of bitcoin's history, there hasn't been **one** address created that would fill the requirements of such a non-random appearing address. We'd probably also already all know about it, because that address would be very famous and worth a buttload of money - it would be invaluable, really.
And maybe this puts you a bit more at ease too (even though it shouldn't be necessary):


That wasn't even the case when the idea started. As you can see from the first page of their thread, [their initial plan was to "burn" the bitcoins by sending them as miner fees]( Shorty after, [someone came up with the argument why that would be a bad idea]( and so they went with the destruction address instead.

Yes, if you agree with the fact that you as a customer of a bank are "borrowing" your money to the bank. Agreeing with that is what I argue against.
We should rather deposit our money at a bank, and pay them to secure it and keep their goddamn greedy hands off it. Full reserve. That would more resemble a banking model that wasn't fucking insane and a huge gamble/borderline scam. And that would in no way prohibit a bank from lending out money, but they'd lend out **their** money, not the money of regular people depositing it with them.

There was a reddit account named let's say "bitcoin_widow". He made a post with this story ("my husband died boohoo, but i think he has bitcoins and stuff whats this paper what do i do with it, might it be worth money?") and then later told that "she" found like 1000 bitcoin on it or something. But the whole thread didn't receive so much attention, and there were some rather clear giveaways, like the number of bitcoins he owned and the wife saying really stupid stuff that sounded fake. Then about 3 months later, the idiot made the same thread, *with the same username, telling the same story*. And then it was **really** obvious that it was fake.


How about you go find it yourself? I'm not your little bitch to dig out year old threads just to please you. I have no idea where to find this.
My original post was speaking from my experience and pointing exactly this fucking fact out: That I have seen this story before, and that it is a hoax. This does not in any way make it my responsibility to spend time looking for it. Either believe me or don't. If you choose to not believe me, that's fucking fine with me. But what do you think is more likely, that somebody makes up this story for shits and giggles, or that I make up that this is a fake story that I have seen before?
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:37:41
That was exaggerated, yet it serves to point out to you what you're apparently not getting.
It's perfectly fine to have the opinion that something is bad and therefore wanting to destroy what you have of it. The argument "but you could give it to someone else" is completely ignoring the fact **why** you don't want it anymore. It's not because you can't make phone calls with it, it's because you don't want to support an organization anymore that steps on everybody's personal freedom. If you'd just give your phone to someone else, that wouldn't accomplish anything in that regard.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:04:36
When 10 people put up bids and asks in USD, and 2 people put up bids and asks in EUR, you'd see that there are 10 bids&amp;asks on the USD order book and 2 bids and ask on the EUR order book. So you **see** the books seperated. 
But if the one ask in EUR is lower than the highest bid in USD (using the USD/EUR exchange rate), then mtgox's system would match and make the trade happen. 
So like I said, it looks like they are seperated, and the order books for the different currencies *are* the order books for the different currencies. But since orders are matched regardless of currency, it behaves like one big, not-so-transparent order book.

Your point kind of explains itself away, because it apparently did **not** centralize further. And no, GHash didn't do shit to stop it (nor could they or should they), the community and market did it themselves.
The only real dangerous point that I can remember was when Asicminer was peaking somewhere close to 40% I think. *That* was real centralization, it was one company getting a dangerously high share in the market. But it was only possible because of the new introduction of ASICs and them basically having a monopoly. What we have now, thousands of individual miners with individual minds just consolidating in the same pool doesn't even compare.
I agree though that it's far from optimal, and I hope some of the smart developers here find a way to remove pools as a trust-bottleneck.

While you're right about the faster BTC mining when difficulty is rising, that has close to absolutely nothing to do with the price. You can't equate 10% over norm bitcoin production with a 10% drop in price. That just ignores all bitcoins that already exists and are being traded.

Maybe through a post on reddit like OP's that points out how utterly retarded it is to buy something that is literally, and *at best*, worth 1/10th of what it costs.
And it's not like it's so difficult to see how much they are worth, it's staring you right in the face if you know how to use a mining calculator.
I remember selling all my AsicMiner shares when they were around 3.5 BTC each, pointing out to everyone that this valuation didn't make any sense, even if you'd assume they would hold their 25% share of the network for years and didn't have any running costs. But people kept buying, up until 5 BTC each, IIRC. And then it crashed. And went down and down and down ever since. It's the exact same story here. Just a matter of time. If you have GH at cex, I would sell them now.

Divisibility will just be increased should this ever become remotely resembling any kind of problem (which is probably decades away). Then we'll have smaller denominations than satoshis, big woop.
Bitcoin is not divisible to 8 decimal places, it is ultimately *infinitely* divisible and was invented with that in mind. Saying "a satoshi is the smallest possible division of a Bitcoin" is simply wrong.

The size of the data structure to secure them is always the same (e.g. the full blockchain), independent of coin age.
I tend to agree though with a fee-system that would make older coins more expensive to move. But I don't know if bitcoin will be able to incorporate that. There will be a lot of discussion about it, but in the end, change demands too much consensus that isn't there.

Not sure where you're going with that. Yes, it's basically the same as accepting cash donations, except you can't send cash over the internet. Only in person or via mail, and what kind of a pain is that, just to make a donation, especially when we're talking internationally? 
Or if you didn't mean cash literally (you probably didn't), but just fiat money, then no it's not the same. First of all, fiat money that you send via bank transfers is under surveillance, it can be stopped, charged back etc. When talking about controversial projects like Tor or Wikileaks, that's not just a matter of principle, it's something that actually stops people from having the freedom to give their money to whom they want. Second, for the same reason some people probably don't want to be associated with giving money to the Tor project. Maybe they're afraid that they're looked at funny the next time they're at the bank, just because their idiot bank teller thinks "Huh, so this guy must be a pedophile", because he has heard about Tor only in that context. And third, it is simply easier. When you already have bitcoins lying around, just sending a little bit is literally a matter of seconds.

I'm not denying banks disallow "suspicious" charges. That can just mean that for example, if I'm always in the US and suddenly have a charge on my CC from Russia, that's a suspicious charge.
What he was saying was that after a large hack, banks would put the accounts in question under monitoring. That implies that when Store XY gets hacked, it runs to the banks and says "look here those are all the credit card numbers that we have from customers", *effectively leaking their data a second time*. I doubt that actually happens. If it does, then yeah, line me in with the the rest who complain about that, because it's pretty retarded.

Use 2 factor authentication on all online accounts that you use with bitcoin. This is really important.
And 20 minutes of reading are usually not enough to fully understand bitcoin (or even the basics really), but that's fine. Let it grow organically. Usually it doesn't take long for someone to become completely obsessed ;)
Don't use gox, use bitstamp. Or coinbase (which uses bitstamp) for convenience.

He could, but if he plans to bruteforce it, making his attack obvious by deleting the wallet could make a victim with a backup move their coins to a new wallet, robbing him of the time he needs to bruteforce.

Not that I know off. If you want to do it later, you need to reset 2FA on each individual account (like blockchain.info, btc-e...) and make your backup then. It's a pain in the ass, but you should do it if you have no backup.
It should also go without saying that you should not keep those backups on your computer. If you do that, it invalidates the whole purpose of 2FA.

Not sure what makes you say that. Prices going down (and Bitcoin being a "deflationary currency" in that sense) is not a given. It completely depends on new demand/adoption outpacing the monetary inflation.
To me, Bitcoin is only a "deflationary currency" once monetary inflation turns negative, i.e when the amount of lost/destroyed coins outpaces fresh coins released through mining.

The only thing that means for them is "we need to mine as much as we can before it halves!!!"


It doesn't mean that at all. The only thing it means is that miners will stop mining if they act rationally. To keep mining at a loss and sitting on their bitcoins is irrational. 
Not that some won't still do it, but to think that this is a definite reason for bitcoin price to increase doesn't make much sense. That logic makes sense for traditional goods like gold, where the supply actually decreases when people stop mining it because the price is too low. But in Bitcoin, there is a constant amount of coin released every 10 minutes, regardless of how many people mine it.

I don't see your point. Are you saying we shouldn't in any way advertise bitcoin because only companies advertise? That's just silly imo. 
We advertise to get people to look into it. 10 minutes of reading about it and most people will be able to understand that there's no company behind it and that that's exactly the point of it. Every introduction to bitcoin makes this very, very clear.

Well, it depends on how much you're sending and how old the coin is.
On low priority transactions, there's a fee enforced.

I don't see how you could miss how I refuted the lie. And I think you should really look at the definition of what a fact is, and what a fucking opinion is. You said "There is zero chance a seller of legal items would [want to use OB]" and I pointed out that that is obviously factually wrong. I didn't in any way change what you wrote, it's what you wrote and as far as I can tell, it was the intended meaning. Did you mean something else?
Somebody says it's "Ebay without Ebay Inc", which is pretty much what OB aims to be, and you say it's SilkRoad, which is never and has never been in any way the goal of OB. So that's a lie. At the very best, it's your misguided opinion, but it definitely is not a "fact".
And I don't think I have to explain why anonymity and decentralisation matter. Pretty much everybody here understands the reasons for decentralisation. And I'm sure you have heard them too, plenty of times, you just choose to ignore that and start up the same bullshit troll discussion for the hundredth time.
There's a guy here, interested in what OB is and how it works, and you come along and have nothing better to do than to bring your stupid "oh it's all for criminals, nobody else would ever want to use it!" to the table.

I hate these type of posts. You're like those vegans that tell people "Ooh, you eat meat? Well, **I** can't live with murdering innocent creatures."
I'm here to get rich quick. If it's a good cause that can help humanity, that's better. But I'm not fucking delusional enough to claim that I'd be here so much if it wasn't making me rich. And I think the same is true for pretty much everybody else.
But this is all part of the genius behind Bitcoin. The "greed" incentive is what helps adoption. For new money to become successful, it needs to be accepted by as many people as possible. If the motivation for people to do so is greed, who cares? Greed is a fantastic motivator. Bitcoin was specifically designed with this in mind.
I suggest everybody takes a serious look in the mirror and understands why they are spending so much time on Bitcoin and not on charity stuff that has a way more direct effect in "helping people". You want to jerk off on how "good" you are and how you're helping the world? Go out and help people. Being pretentious about your internet money isn't helping anyone.

This only works for your Google Account. You can't have all your authenticator codes recovered like this. And think about it, you wouldn't want that, because it would mean the codes were on Google's servers.
If you want to backup your codes, you need to do it when you set it up the first time. If you want to do it later, you will have to reset the code on the site. Like on blockchain.info, turn off 2FA, then turn it back on again with a new code, and back that up.

No normal person is in danger of starving when they lose their money. Normal people have an income.
And also, it's only possible if you'd lose *all* your money. Take walking money with you, your reserves should be stored safely of course. If you think you're not smart enough to store your money securely, then yeah, go ahead and personally insure yourself against theft. And thanks for doing that and not having everyone who *isn't* too dumb for personal financial responsibility pay for you too.
As usual, it all comes down to freedom. In a bitcoin world, you'd have the freedom to decide, the freedom that you currently have not.

You're not costing him any money, you're just costing *everyone else* money. Only when you've cost all the innocent people enough money that they give up with the pool, *then* the pool operator loses something.

The recent bc.i problem was related to exactly the R-value problem the image mentions (which usually is a problem of "shitty random numbers").


Well, knowing that good random number creation is important is important. Sure. For developers and the like. It does not have much to do with the content of the picture though, imo. Neither is actually anything explained. It's just a snarky remark on an otherwise explanatory picture.
The purpose of the picture is explaining the idea and safety of strong cryptography. Bitcoin and cryptography noobs learning about addresses and private keys etc., sooner or later come to ask a thing like "but can't two people just create the same key?" or "can't I just keep trying keys and then find someone else's money?". This image illustrates quite well the practical impossibility of something like that, and with it, the whole basis of the Bitcoin security.
Latching something onto the image that's basically: "Oh yeah but really use random values though, k?" only in trollier tone and mentioning something that noobs sure as hell won't understand; I don't think that accomplishes anything here.

Have you actually read what I posted? This wasn't about the share price. This was about their financial reports - the share price plummeting is just the result of that. They propped up their numbers by $72.6M in Q4, actually having just $1m in net income, compared to $8.8 million in the year before.
And this just goes to show exactly what my point was in this silly little discussion. That overstock was very aware they had problems, and so they took a chance with Bitcoin. I think their CEO really believes in it, but I'm sure they'd never gone for it if they didn't think they'd need the advertising.

That's not nearly enough. It's absolutely *impossible* that the rest of the coins disappeared without MtGox acting criminally. I really, really hope Karpeles goes to jail for this. There is no way I can imagine where he doesn't deserve it.
Anyway, if I get 23% of my coins back, I will have actually made profit off this (at least on the coin side). I sent money to gox when everybody was panicking and the price was extremely low. Bought roughly 8 coins at $130 = ~$1000. If I get 23% of the btc back, I'd get 1.84 btc, which at a price of $600 makes about $1100.
Buuuuuut I also sent another $1500 after the first, and never got a chance to turn those into btc, since the site went down. So there goes the profit. Still, it was a good bet and I'd probably do it again.

No, we absolutely don't. What some losing bidders in this "syndicate" say doesn't matter, that's not the value of the actual bid.
Each **actual** bid in the auction had to be for 3000 Bitcoins.
If someone says he bid $600/Bitcoin, but he bid only for 100 coins, that doesn't tell you anything. If the buyers for the 2900 other coins only bid $200, that gives you an *actual* bid of $213.33/Bitcoin.
Therefore, you can't conclude from any individual statement of these small-time-bidders what the real bid was. Any attempt to claim you could was nothing but stupid pump - which evidently worked, since this feels like the 10th time I'm explaining this.

No, proof of stake is just that: proof that you have money. In a proof of stake system, you are not incentivized to have any more than 1 minimal node. You can put all your stake on 1 node and that's that. The point is there's no incentive for building nodes, just for aquiring a big stake, because that determines your reward. And your staking node doesn't actually have to perform like a good node (relay transactions, spread the blockchain etc.) If you want to just be an asshole-node that saves resources, you can do nothing except what is necessary to get your PoS reward.

Bitcoin isn't meant to be a socialism program. It's not meant to redistribute wealth uniformly across the world. That's something that, in my opinion, will never be achieved. Winners will be winners, and losers will be losers.
What Bitcoin means to do is take away the unfair advantage that is currently held by the people/ogranisations in control of the money supply. Institutions that create money can't do so in a Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin makes this necessary process public and fair.

Since you mention the ads, allow me to rage about what I experienced this morning... 
When I wanted to watch this video, I actually got a Bitcoin advertisment on youtube (had never had that happen before). 3 minutes long, it was the most horrifying piece of shit I've ever seen that was meant to be *pro* Bitcoin. I wish I could link to it or find it in some way. It was **awful**.
Made (and I guess paid for) by a guy named ["fyrstikken"]( After googling that name he also appears to be the guy who runs cryptorush.in (or heavily involved in it), which is an altcoin-exchange turned scam (stole a few hundred btc I think).
The ad was 3 minutes of him sitting there in his dark room in what can only be described as homeless-people-clothes, looking like he hasn't taken a shower for weeks. In a monotone voice with a strong accent, which made him sound mentally handicapped, he was saying stuff like "Bitcoin is worth more than THOUSAND dollars now, you can make so much money now with Bitcoin, you should buy Bitcoin, you will make thousands of dollars per day just daytrading, blablabla". And that's the ad.
I really hope no one who isn't already a Bitcoiner watches that, because if it was me, the last thing I'd want to do was *ever* buy Bitcoin.

I agree that the reason to join Bitcoin for now is mainly ideological, and I suppose it will stay that way for a looong time still. But the problem is not that people don't care. They just don't know. If they knew, many of them would care. It's a problem of education.


None of those is (or should be, imo) the main reason to support Bitcoin. The reason comes from seeing how current money is created out of nothing in an incredibly unfair process, enriching the most parasitic types of institutions for doing absolutely nothing.
If more people had an understanding of what money is and how they are getting buttfucked by the system that creates it, lots of them would embrace Bitcoin immediately.
The thing is that if a critical mass of people does that, for ideological reasons, Bitcoin becomes so good on its own that it can suck in the rest of the non-believers out of sheer usefulness.

There is no exchange without money here. It's buying BTC for fiat, which is like buying a pair of shoes for fiat: a regular purchase.
And for bartering (which has nothing at all to do with this): No, you don't need to pay tax on the *entire* transaction when bartering. You pay tax on the proceeds, just like with every other goddamn income. Only that in the case of bartering, you need to estimate the "fair market value" of the goods to calculate that income.

Block/confirmation time is a tradeoff. You need to weigh the risk of wasted work due to chain forks (orphans) against better usability through faster confirmation times. Satoshi determined 10 minutes as a good tradeoff back in the day. And it's not bad. And if you think that 10 mins is the perfect time for that, sure. 
But plenty of altcoins have already proven that a lower time works perfectly fine. And why would the optimal setting for this be *exactly* 10 minutes? Why not 10.1, or 9.5? It's more or less an arbitrary pick. That leaves room for optimization.

OK, well you're implying the merchants can't cover possible chargebacks from their fiat account while still purchasing bitcoin on all the regular purchases. I would disagree with that. The worst that would happen is a momentary disproportion between what customers bought which was translated to btc and the merchant's fiat reserves. They could still exchange the btc back if they needed to. There's no *scam* here that isn't possible with every other shop that takes credit cards.

Yeah. I bought coins, payed and missed the 60 min window when you have to confirm payment. Which is completely my fault, of course. On a side note, I still think it's ridiculous that this is even necessary. We were promised instant trading with Fidor *a year ago*, and nothing has happened so far. By now, I just think it was a marketing trick and will never happen anyway.
Anyway, I noticed my mistake and of course immediately contacted support. I asked them to reopen the trade *and most importantly, to lock the counterparty's bitcoins, so they couldn't disappear*. They reopened the trade, asked the other guy to confirm when he got the payment, and ignored my other request. 
The other guy then said "Yeah don't worry, I have sold the bitcoins already (whoopsie...), but I'm mining them and my farm makes about 0.25 per day, so in a few days you can have yours". At this point I should have already known that he was never going to pay, since there was no way that he would have accidentally just sold the coins again. 
Anyway, he then kept dragging it out over 3 weeks, claiming he never received the money, blabla. I provided proof from my bank that I paid to the support, multiple times (since they kept ignoring it), told them again and again to lock the user, that he was lying etc. The responses I got for my lengthy tickets were ridiculous. "We aked the user to check his bank again", over and over. Gee, thanks for asking him! The worst thing was that I could see on his increasing rating numbers that he was still actively trading, probably moving coins in and out as if nothing happened. In the end, they finally gave me his personal data (like I'm seriously going to sue someone in Slowenia) and just closed every communication channel with the words "our service here is over, you can sue him". And just left the fucker in business.
Just to be clear, I know that I screwed up by not confirming the payment, but still, there was a lot bitcoin.de could have done to help me - and I told them exactly what needed to be done, multiple times. And not only didn't they do it, they just completely ignored everything I said. And the worst is that in the end, they just left him to keep trading there.

We're not talking about volume here. Obviously, with a rising BTC price, the transacted amount of BTC decreases.
Your topic of this thread was that you thought there was no increase in the number of transactions. As pointed out with his more appropriate chart, that is not true and there is very much a noticeable increase in transaction numbers.


They are.  
And now instead of accepting that, you choose to derail this thread and in those humongous sub-threads here you start up with all sorts of different bullshit topics that don't really have a place here.

To be fair, he said right from the start that their approach would be a strict one. I don't remember the exact wording, but that they generally found it to work better to put on tight regulations first and loosen them over time, than to have loose regulations and tighten them over time. What "works better" means here is up to interpretation, probably "makes shit easier for us regulators while stifling innovation". Anyway, he said it.
So what happened there could be expected, but it's not the end of the story. Over time, it will hopefully get less restrictive.

No. You're trying to put me on the other side when that's not at all where I'm standing. I've been here long enough to have made clear on many occasions that I sympathize with ancap and especially everything surrounding the concept and implications of cryptoanarchy. 
And no, what I happen to believe is not "irrelevant to this". Your whole first post was based on the idea that I "disagree with you ideologically". When in fact, I don't, and I don't have to. Agreeing with an ideology and agreeing with how people express themselves about it are two different things. Even if I like the message, that doesn't mean I like someone yelling dumb simplifications of it in my ear. And if I see someone who doesn't agree with the message, I don't yell those things at him.
That's why I think it's unfair that this guy, who only explained his opinion, gets downvoted to oblivion, while the thread is full of "boo evil government" one liners that get upvoted.


Now *that* is a nice straw man.


My understanding does not at all "necessitate" radicalism, wow... My point is exactly that it does NOT necessitate this. How can you even read it that wrong?!


I believe reddit downvotes are not meant as "I don't think this is true", they are meant to disencourage bad behaviour. Attacking other people for example. If you don't agree with a comment, but all that someone does is express his opinion on a subject, and he articulates it just fine, then you're not supposed to downvote him. 
If you believe it's merely meant as a opinion barometer, fine. But lots of subs explicitly have rules explaining that is *not* what it should be used for.


The guy was obviously surprised and hurt by the downvotes. Now you're coming at me with "moral authority" when I tried to explain to him what I think the main reason is why he got downvoted? "Moral authority"? Jesus, you really like throwing words. 




No, not "read:". Those two have nothing in common. If you don't understand what I'm saying, please stop trying to summarize it.
I don't think this discussion is going anywhere, and I think all of the hatred in your head is based on nothing but wrong assumptions that you're probably not going to lay to rest anyway. So I don't think it makes sense to further this.

Not really. P2Pool is one big decentralized pool. It uses a second blockchain where a block is found every 30 seconds and the difficulty is much lower. 
If you start a P2pool node and use it alone, you're not solomining *bitcoin*. You're solomining on the P2Pool blockchain. Finding a block on P2Pool then gives you a "share" of the payout when a real bitcoin block is found. 
Now if a lot of people use *your* node - basically as a proxy to the p2pool network - they work with you on finding p2pool blocks, which again gives you as the operator centralized power. ~~Your node then is to the p2pool network what a classic pool like GHash is to the bitcoin network.~~

The important part to understand here is what they mean when they say "BTC is held in escrow". It doesn't mean that you send them bitcoin, they hold it, and then later they release it to the other side (which is basically what regular exchanges do already).
It means they use bitcoin escrow via multi-sig transactions, in a way that they could NEVER take the bitcoin for themselves, the only thing they can do is decide whether your trading partner gets the coins, or you get them back (if the buyer didn't pay you for example).

When people talk about Bitcoin's deflationary aspects, they don't mean that "the price is increasing", which is basically the gist of what you're trying to eloquently cover in bullshit in this comment-tree.

Also, stop saying "bit coin". It's not "a bit coin" like "you're a bit stupid", it's "a bitcoin".

Stop projecting your misfortune onto everyone else. Sucks that you came into Bitcoin at such a bad time, but if you're not dumb I'm sure you didn't put your life savings in it before you made any profit. If you did, then that's probably a lesson you better learned now than later. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:31:48
Not at all. You're holding a specific amounts of bitcoin as your stash, and replacing everything you spend from that stash. If you believe that bitcoin grows in value over time, you profit from that, while still being able to maintain your spending habits without thinking you're losing out.
And you're not simply "buying everything with cash". You're buying with bitcoin, and spending cash to replace the spent coin. If you're spending coin to buy something online from someone on the other end of the world, maybe someone who values his privacy, then he might not want to take your cash, but take your bitcoin. You're gaining all the benefits of bitcoin in the process (e.g a fast, anonymous, cheap, global transaction).
Granted on the point of tax nightmare, though I suppose if you do everything over Coinbase it's relatively easy. Export all your spends and buys and have it automatically calculated.

You pay for gains you make. Like your article describes:


So if you buy 1 bitcoin for $400 then buy something with it for $400, you have no gain and don't pay any taxes. If you buy 1 bitcoin for $300 then buy something with it worth $400, you have $100 in income, which is taxed just like any other income.

This calculation goes the wrong way. Energy consumption and its cost *follows* the Bitcoin price, not the other way around.
When Bitcoin grows in value 10x, that means more miners join, increasing the cost of mining. It does not work in the way that more miners join, increase the cost of mining and therefore the price of Bitcoin. This would be true if the **only** coins that were sold were the freshly minted coins - but that's not the case. If miners have higher costs and think "well I'm not going to sell my coins below what I payed for mining them", that doesn't stop all the other people from trading the millions of already existing coins.

Yes, micropayment **channels**, that's something different though (but very interesting!). They're basically more like delayed payments, where the "total amount" gets increased over time, so that at any point of time, both sides of the transaction can close the channel and publish the transaction. 
It's still not "micropayments". You still can't go to a webstore and buy a little icon for your project for $.15 for example. But you can watch a girl get naked and pay her in continueing small increments, in a trustless way that doesn't involve any centralized website (just one example for an application for this, but a pretty obvious one, me thinks).

That doesn't make them worth something. They wouldn't then get $3 trillion in taxes a year, but $3 quadrillion or something. The number isn't important, what the dollars are *worth* is. And with no demand for any real goods, and nobody valuing them, there would be no value.
This has happened many times before, as someone named "historian", you should probably know that. When people lose confidence in a nation's money, it becomes toilet paper, and the government can't do anything about that. Not like they haven't tried in the past. They print more and more of it to counteract the falling value of the fiat, yadda yadda, hyperinflation.

That is what I meant - "based on the scarcity and value of precious metals". Not that there generally shouldn't be any paper notes. Proper backing is what's important. The problem is that governments just can't be trusted with this, they cheat.
And it's good that you bring up the great depression, because it's an example for exactly the opposite of what you say: it was to a large degree a result of *breaking* with the gold standard, not a consequence of following it. Way before the Great Depression (starting ~1917), the FED started issuing more money than was backed by gold, effectively counterfeiting money. They mainly started doing this because a first World War had to be financed.
The stock market boom in the 20s was in the same way the result of this (huge amounts of new money in circulation lead to booming stocks, everybody puts on a nice fake smile for a while) and subsequently resulted in the great depression when the whole house of cards of fake money started to fall in on itself.
That means the U.S. were already **not** on the gold standard. The U.S. officially followed a gold standard until the 1970s, but it broke it *loooong* before that.

The state makes it illegal. That doesn't mean that if there was no state, there would be no violence. What kind of a fairytale viewpoint is that?
If it were legal, it would be the state, or an entity acting in the same function, that would keep it controlled. Like with alcohol. That is why drugs "being legal" would be better. Making it legal would mean building an environment in which it can be legal. That would still require rules.

If you have some malware on your computer, it will just send the data once you reconnect to the internet. It only really makes sense to do on a computer that will never go online again. But the usual advice "download the html, disconnect from the internet, then reconnect" is pointless.
And I'm not saying this does nothing, just almost nothing. People could also give the advice "always carefully close your curtains and dim your lights when handling private keys so that nobody with a high tech camera on the roof of the building next to yours could capture it".

How about your government pretty much banning all banks from ever dealing with anything Bitcoin related? That probably put a little stone in the way too?
They should go *"we're trying to influence or change the course of the government/PBOC here"* or they could go *"screw what they're saying, due to Bitcoin's decentralized nature, we're just going to use it, and there's nothing they can do"*.
But this attitude of ignoring and denying what's happening is simply laughable and based solely in greed. The exchanges are just trying to milk this thing as much as they can before they are finally shut down.

No, the price is determined by supply and demand. If there's nobody that wants btc, they'll be worth nothing. If we find out they cure cancer, they're worth a lot.
That reaching the max doesn't guarantee stability can be seen by the dozens of altcoins that have reached that max already (or started out with a fixed supply). Let me tell you, they are not stable at all :D
If Bitcoin ever reaches a relatively stable state (and I believe it can), it'll be because it is well established and trusted in the world. That's still a long time off.

The price of an item is the point where the supply at a given price intersects the demand at a specific price. If there is no supply at 0 price and no demand above 0 price, then there's no such intersection and therefore no price. Where am I wrong?

When you're running on a public p2pool, do you get the payments directly to your address, as in, included in the coinbase transaction, or do they gather coins for you and you request individual withdrawals from time to time (like you do with classic pools)?
While I think that p2pool is a great way of decentralizing mining again, it creates a big problem with its huge transactions. If everybody was mining with p2pool, I'd expect the 1MB block size to not to be enough just to pay every miner, let alone have any other transactions in the block.

"Large transactions somehow don't work we dunno why sorriez just don't take much btc out and will work ok?"
Read between the lines, guys. Really... "This problem applies primarily to larger transactions", that is **nonsense**. Bitcoin is more or less indifferent to the size of a transaction. If anything, the opposite would be more likely - since larger transactions are more **easy** (requiring less of a fee).
You know what causes large transactions to not work? If there's not enough BTC there to make them!

Properly decentralized, at least that is the idea. You can create contracts, which is a bunch of special code, and that code is executed by nodes of the network (or rather, by miners, I think?), without a central server. 
The code of such a contract could say "Gather all money sent to this contract and store the sending addresses. Then every week (every X blocks) , calculate a random number based on the last block hash, determine one of the saved addresses to be the winner based on that random number, then pay out all the saved money to that address."

@_date: 2014-06-05 14:22:22


Nah, you got that wrong. Bitcoin creation is independent of making transactions.
Bitcoins are created in a process called "mining". Mining means that the miner takes all the bitcoin transactions he received over the network and tries to make a fitting "block" out of them. This involves finding a special number called a "nonce". This nonce is just a random number, and the miner basically just tries one nonce after the other until he finds one that makes his block of transactions a valid block (this takes billions of attempts). We then say that he "found a block". He tells the rest of the network that he found a block, all the transactions in that block become valid (confirmed) and the miner is rewarded with the block reward (currently and for the next 2 years, that's 25 BTC).
The difficulty of finding a block is automatically adjusted every 2 weeks by the network, so that it takes on average 10 mins until some miner somewhere in the world finds a block. So if more people try to mine bitcoin, it gets harder.
For a more detailed explanation, google it, or maybe read [this article]( as a starting point. It's a bit complicated, yet genious process.

You make it seem as if there has to be some evil plot behind it or something. If there are 0% fees, volume means **nothing.** And that is not because evil people are doing evil things, it's just because a no-fee-exchange is a botters paradise. When a bot sees just a single btc profit, then it's a win. And so they trade back and forth, back and forth, trying to profit. That'all that is happening here. And even if it's not, there is absolutely no reason to suspect otherwise. Just forget the goddamn volume numbers, because coming from a no-fee-exchange, they mean **nothing.** If Huobi was introducing even something low like a 0.1% fee, you would immediately see the volume drop as if it was never there.

My proposal: Use units that people already know and are familiar with.

Yes, true. Those are there too. But that's just a small part. If you have 5% interest per year, there are 5% new coins created over the year. Unlike Bitcoin, PoS coins usually have ongoing inflation/unlimited supply.
And for the transaction fees, the same applies: If you have 20% of the total supply, you get 20% of all PoS blocks and so you get 20% of all fees paid. The rest of the network has 80%, gets 80% of the blocks and so 80% of the fees. So if the fees are the same on average per block, nothing changes about who has what percentage.

They could say they detected mismatching in their software due to this behaviour, that they're sorry they didn't catch that before and that they are working on fixing it. 
But instead, they blame Bitcoin and go like "Yeah we discovered this critical flaw in Bitcoin, huge problem, not our fault though, Bitcoin buggy!"
I don't even mind so much that this stuff came up, shit happens. Better sooner than later. But the way these guys communicate, it's just retarded. Take some goddamn responsibility, ffs.

Here is the relevant part:


It's not so much that he says **he** (or Circle) is going to do a fork, he's warning that it will happen. And I can agree that that's possible. 
I think a hard fork is inevitable anyway at some point, but it would be best if it happens with global consensus, otherwise it's going to get really ugly. God forbid we end up with 2 Bitcoins. And in a few decades, the two groups will start killing each other like sunnites and shiites...

Say 2 people solve the same block at almost the same time. Only one of them can become the "real" block, the other one gets orphaned. It depends on which miner solves the next block, and on which of the 2 concurring blocks he builds his.
Orphaned blocks are a regular thing, nothing to be worried about in general. But it's odd if it happens so frequently, because then it's not just a matter of "blocks solved close to each other".

Yes, basically. When you send tx 1 to address A and then immediately send tx 2 (which is based on 1) to address B, before 1 has a confirmation, someone can change the tx 1 (so that for example it's now tx 14) and if that tx 14 gets taken into a block, then tx 2 will not be valid anymore because it's based on 1.
You don't lose anything, but you'd have to send the tx again.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:47:01
The only one not understanding this here is you. I'm not trying to be mean or something, I truly want you to understand this. Calm down and try to.
Yes, it is all probabilistic. But the big difference is that with 50+% of the hashrate, you can build your own chain and yours will be the longest, after a given time to allow variance. The Bitcoin system only looks at the longest blockchain, that is the ultimate true blockchain in its eyes. It has no knowledge whether someone "mined it first" or anything like that. Only the longest valid blockchain counts. And if you have the bigger part of the mining power, you are the one with the biggest blockchain. You can then completely ignore what all other miners are doing, because you know that your blockchain, the one that you design at your will, will be the longest. If someone else mines a block before you do, you just ignore it and mine the same block + the next - *bam* you still have the biggest chain, and the block the other guy mined is orphaned (invalid).
Please just think about this for a while. This is exactly how the probabilities are at work here, and that is why the 50% tipping point is important, and why people are even talking about a "51% attack". Otherwise, why do you think this is a thing? People were just randomly picking the "51%"?

Yes, there are - how close to 0 effort did you put into finding some? Enter ["buy bitcoins"]( in google and coinbase.com is right there. Use that.
Anyway, if you're using companies, they will ask for verification first before letting you buy coins, that means you have to give them your name and address etc. The bitcoins you get later are still anonymous on their own, but understand that theoretically, someone (men in uniforms) could trace your payment back to the exchange where you bought them and ask the exchange for your data. This is not really realistic and unless you're planning on doing something that rustles some major jimmies, this shouldn't concern you.

I don't know if you people don't learn or if you just want to spread FUD.
I've said this a few times: No country is going to really ban Bitcoin. That's impossible. It's like "banning math", it doesn't make any sense. If some country does it, they're idiots. 
What they will likely do instead (and are already doing) is work against it in more subtle ways. Attacking the exchanges and operators for example.

You have to differentiate between *fork of the software* and *blockchain fork*. 
You're talking about a fork of the blockchain. Yes, that would only happen when 2 different groups, using *two versions of the software*, kept mining onto their forked branches. And yes, if everyone agrees to use the new software (e.g. with &gt;1MB blocksize), the *blockchain* wouldn't fork.
But the new software still is a hard fork, because it doesn't work with the old software.

...prepare for a mountain of clueless theories.
Here's my take: Bitcoin price went down a lot even though nothing actually happened to Bitcoin. Everybody already in Bitcoin knew that MtGox isn't Bitcoin and everybody pretty much knew this trend was going to reverse at some point. 
In addition to that, Bitcoin has received **huge** publicity during these last weeks. The people getting into Bitcoin due to this take a while to get in - after all, you have to learn your shit, get verified at exchanges etc. Bubbles always start like this, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if we were on the verge of another one.

The whole security of bitcoin is based on the fact that even if you have all computers on earth do nothing else but guess private keys for millions of years, they would never guess the same number that you took for a private key.
So you definitely **need** a big and random number. If the space for possible combinations was small (like if you only have a 8 digit number), there would constantly be collisions between addresses.
*But*, that doesn't mean that you can't afterwards create services that map certain names to certain bitcoin addresses. Just like for web addresses, you have the IP 173.194.112.0, which is arguably "random and so damn long", but you have a system (DNS) on top that maps simpler names to this IP (in this case "google.com").

Maybe you're right. In that case, my understanding of what falls under money laundering and what not was wrong.

That is hard to say. And I wouldn't argue that Bitcoin necessarily did it perfectly right. But it is safe to say that distribution has to happen over a *long* period of time. There's a whole bunch of altcoins that had mining for very short periods of time, or straight out sold the entiry supply IPO-style. And they will all fail (most are pretty much outright scams from the start anyway), because they don't understand that this doesn't work.
Distribution is the one of the toughest issues with a new currency, and I would definitely say that just throwing it all out there to a handful of people and assuming the rest will happen by magic is not going to work.
Mining in bitcoin ensures that there is a continuous source of new currency that can be and will be distributed, even if all the other early holders just decide to hoard their coins.

Yes, basically, though I don't know if you can pay with credit card (highly doubt it). 
The important thing is that you don't just buy the cloud hashing as in "x GH/s for 1 year", [it's an exchange]( so you can buy and sell GHs and the market determines the price. As long as you hold those GH-"shares", you get dividends according to how much you own and how much is mined.
They take a fee on every trade on the exchange, that's where they make a buttload of money and which is the reason why they can offer 0% fees for their regular pool. Keep in mind, they first sell you the hash power directly for a good price and then collect fees again and again and again as the hash power is handed around between people. Oh and they also have a "maintenance fee" that is substracted from your mining reward. It is a friggin' gold mine.
I think it offers a cool market process to determine the value of "1 GH/s". But I would never purchase anything there. I bet most people who buy there lose money in the process. Plus you literally pay for the centralization of mining, which is really, really bad. If a regular pool gets 51%, it's not so bad. The miners behind it can still more or less do what they want, and leave the pool when the owner misbehaves. But if GHash.io has 51% in *own hardware*, that's **bad**.

If you say you sold 100 BTC for a sandwich because you didn't know any better, and then $50k show up on your bank account that you have no explanation for, there's your problem. That's where money laundering comes in, where you'd have to try to make up fake explanations for where that money comes from. Nothing about this is new or special to Bitcoin.

One thing though: I actually expected the 3 cards I ordered to have the same private key, so I could store them in different places, protecting the same coins. I figure now that you created multiple from the intermediate code. But you should give the users the option to do that. It makes a lot of sense to have multiple copies of the same address.

A hacker that could delete your wallet could also just steal it.
If the wallet is encrypted, he would probably still rather steal it and try to crack it than to just delete it.
Deleting wallets just for the tiny-theoretical-long-time increase in value is so stupidly evil I can't imagine someone doing that.

Well, here in Germany we don't use credit cards as much as you guys overseas, but pay regularly with EC cards (I think that's what you call debit cards) that need a PIN. Much, much better security-wise. But it's pretty much for brick &amp; mortar only. For online, there's bank wires and services like Paypal.
There's a lot of reasons for Bitcoin, but none of that is that there's otherwise no better centralized system imaginable than credit cards.
And I'd say the only reasons for it not changing is because most people are completely unaware of the problem, and because there's a huge industry behind keeping this monstrosity alive.

"Stealing" blocks is different than withholding them. 
You can choose not to send a block that you found back to the pool, so no one gets anything. But you can't change the block so that you get the full block reward: doing that changes the hash of the block, which makes it not a valid block anymore.

No, you need 50+% to reliably execute a double spend. Yes, with lower hash, you could theoretically gamble. You could do your transaction, then hope that you get the next X blocks, not publish them, then release them all at once. But the chances are moving against you. The rest of the network has a higher chance of having the longest chain than you, so just hoping that you're lucky would hardly make for a good chance for a double spend. Most of the time, you would just throw a lot of money out the window (because you're not getting the block rewards then).
But if you have 50+% of the hashrate, you can withhold blocks for such an amount of time until you are ahead (have the longest chain), which will eventually happen because you are building the blocks faster than the rest. Even if you are really unlucky and it takes 50 blocks until you are ahead again, you will eventually get there. **That is why the 50% border is so important.**

A common liability clause doesn't mean they are not responsible for fraud or criminal negligence regarding their customers' assets. If they said they were in their ToS, that isn't legal.


Maybe you are even right here and they aren't seriously investigating (though the official word is that investigations are ongoing). But they sure as hell should be.

Let's assume that they had exactly the same number of transactions as in october. That still doesn't change the obvious observation that it's overall increasing.
Take that little graph you posted: 
Ignore the peak in November, forget your irrelevant assumptions about December, and tell me: are the numbers increasing or not? Or is it just that "the media is watching us all year" and that's why the numbers are increasing?


You're not wrecking anything except your credibility, you miserable little monkey. You know exactly that I'm right and you just can't accept it.

OK, double spend scenario A. I am the attacker and have 40% of the hashrate.
I buy a car in one transaction. Now I want to double spend that transaction back to myself. I now have to **hope** that I mine the next, say, 6 blocks. Since I'm not faster than the rest of the network, it has to be exactly these next blocks and I have to be a bit lucky. The longer I have to build the chain, the lower my chances are of being able to hold the longest chain.
Now scenario B. I have 51%. I buy the car. And now I withold blocks, **for as long as I want**, because while withholding them, I will, after long enough time, always have the longest chain. The rest of the network has already put 40 blocks after my initial car-buying transaction? Who cares, I've hidden 50 in the meantime! They have 40 blocks, but I'm only at 30? Who cares, I build them faster on average, so I just withold them longer, I will eventually catch up. When I'm ready, I release the big stack of blocks, grabbing all the block rewards and having my double spend transaction included.
The difference here is that it's **not** just a chance anymore when you have more than 50%. If you are unlucky, you just have to wait some more, withold some more blocks. When you know that you have the highest hash power in the network, you **know** that you will be successful in executing a double spend, it is not just a chance.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:04:19


Yes they are easier to mine, because you already know one of the solutions. Whether there are multiple others is irrelevant. 
When you as a pool know that nonce "54192" makes the block valid and you tell the miner to search from "54000" to "54192", you know he will find a valid solution. If he reports back "Nope, nothing, gimme more work", you know he's lying.

It means you're just using BTC as the payment method, not as the currency. Because you're effectively still just paying with dollars. That's ok, but it isn't great.
With btctrip, you're using it as both, the payment method and the currency, because the other side actually accepts the currency and keeps it without exchanging it immediately.
Of course he eventually has to exchange some to stock up his fiat reserves (to pay for tickets), but he doesn't do that immediately, and that's an important difference in philosophy. It's the difference between someone who just wants another payment method and free advertising through Bitcoin and someone who truly believes in Bitcoin, trusts it as a currency and wants it to succeed.
Only people who take Bitcoin directly can at some point enable a closed loop economy. And because of that, it's great and admirable that there are people out there taking that risk. So far, it has rewarded them greatly.

Those numbers prove my point. That usage has clearly increased over the last year.
All you're arguing about in that thread is that the 5000/day number Bitpay said doesn't line up. You don't know what average they took, could be from one week, could be that they just took the highest day they had, who cares? That doesn't change anything. 
I'll say it one more time, since you're very, very slow: Usage of bitcoin has definitely increased over the last year. This is an objective and undeniable fact. So please, prove more and more what kind of a ignorant fucktard you are by denying it.

With his 1.6TH, he'd get about every 8300th block when solo mining, and that is just with current difficulty, which is constantly increasing. So yes, he could do that, but would risk a lot of variance. With pool mining, he has constant income flow.

That's still the same thing. 
Miners who don't follow the new fork will keep mining their *original* way, and miners who follow the fork will mine using the *new* way, creating a forked blockchain. 
What it boils down to in the end is which one of the two chains *people* accept and use. 
Miners can put however much hashrate they want onto either chain, if no end user wants to accept it as valid, it's useless.
For example, if we switched to a new, more ASIC resistant way of mining, many miners would cry out over their now useless hardware that they spent a lot of money on. But if everyone else only accepts blocks made the new, ASIC-resistant way, there's nothing they can do. The problem here is that the 2 groups "people who use Bitcoin" and "miners" greatly overlap. That's why such a hard fork is vey risky; it would likely end in 2 different forms of Bitcoin being used at the same time.

True. Still, the whole situation speaks for it. The way they said they'd take measures against the 51% threat and then suddenly you have this new entity that calls itself "too avoid 51%". 
It is *very* unlikely this is a single miner/mining organization that just decided to not mine with GHash anymore. They make up 12.5% of the network currently. No mining datacenter I know off is anywhere near that big.
Occam's razor says this is just still GHash. Even if it's Bitfury, I'd count them as GHash in that case. Aren't they the ones allegedly running all the hardware that is allegedly backing the cex.io exchange?

I agree with you, and have at the time always said Cyprus was never the cause of the bubble. But to be fair, nobody is saying that *Cypriots* were the cause, they say *what was happening in Cyprus* was the cause. Number of downloads doesn't disprove that in any way. I can be in the U.S and hear about people in Cyprus getting robbed by their banks and think "humm maybe Bitcoin isn't such a bad idea".
But yes, it wasn't the cause. But that is easily shown by the fact that the bubble started way before Cyprus was even an issue.


Absolutely correct. The world is too complex to always be reduced to such simple cause and effect chains. The April bubble wasn't "because of Cyprus" and the November bubble wasn't "because of China". It's always a lot of different things.

Nobody has the currency "by default". The whole point of the mining scheme is to ensure a more or less fair distribution. 
Why do you think there are so many people saying things like "awww 2 years ago I had so many Bitcoin, if I hadn't sold them I would be a millionaire now!"? There's big risk in not selling. People who manage to do that have every right to their larger share, if btc increases in price, it's their reward for taking the risk. Just as they lose a lot of money if it fails.

You get **a lot** of transactions for $50. So either you're paying way too much fees, or you somehow think that even for that big number of transactions (should be over 1k), $50 is high, which I would disagree with.
And the fact that you have paid less than $50 in bank/cc fees in your lifetime is simply wrong, actually off by orders of magnitude. Just because merchants put it in the price doesn't mean the fee isn't there. It's like me saying I never had to pay taxes (VAT) when I go shopping, just because the VAT is included in the price.

No, that is not a solution which would definitely work. It involves someone doing escrow. There's the trusted entity I was talking about. And that is one even aside of the bank, in which you're also putting your trust again.
What that proposal does is already easily possible today. It's just a more clever way of sending notarized bank statements to the escrow guy to prove you have made a payment.
When you're trading different crypto-currencies on a decentralized exchange, you can trade freely without relying on *anyone* except the working network. When you want to do the same involving fiat, **you can't**.


This is not a limitation by my imagination, it's a limitation that comes with fiat. Fiat involves centralized trust **by design**. It doesn't matter *what* system you build *on top* of it, you will not change those basic rules.

This is a thread about a billionaire investor who believes in Bitcoin. What *you* claim is that he's just using us/it to make money and that he doesn't really believe it. That's not true, and it's not our obligation to prove that he's not lying. You on the other hand should offer some more convincing arguments except that he's making money off it - that is true for every investment. Saying "He believes in anything that will make him money." doesn't give your claims any weight. That is silly opinionated nonsense.
And don't be surprised if Bitcoiners get hostile towards you when you call Bitcoin "technically worthless". It's not technically worthless. It's technically worth around 800 bucks right now.
There are definitely people who try to abuse Bitcoin for their needs (and that is fine), but I don't think Fred Wilson is that guy. I believe Max Keiser is, because often enough when he talks, you see that he doesn't really understand what he's talking about. And yes, that **is** a way of seeing how credible people are. Contrary to popular opinion, you don't have to be a "nerdy kid with special powers" as you put it. Bitcoin isn't that hard to understand if you take a few days to really absorb the concept and the implications.


Well, what don't you see? I'm sure you've heard some arguments before. What we have here is a technology that allows mankind to have a decentralized public asset ledger, one that doesn't depend on 3rd parties to maintain it. This is the first time in history we have something like this - it's a true innovation. And when you say that you don't see the point of it, what do you mean? That this is something that you can't see a use for? I can prove ownership of something using the blockchain, without going to a notary or depending on anyone. I can prove it, for eternety, with the undeniable security of math.
Saying that's not useful in any way or "doesn't have a point" is just so ... ignorant that we tend to assume people who say that don't understand it. Maybe you find [this talk from 2012]( helpful to give you some inspiration about the possible implications.

- Miner knows what block he is mining on.
- He makes sure 10 other nodes (that he controls) also see the same block. These don't have to be miners, just nodes.
- When miner finds valid nonce, he just sends it to the other nodes. This needs barely any bandwidth. 
- All nodes can publish the block and so it will propagate faster.
It's an interesting idea.

True, this might mitigate it somewhat, but still, if you're buying in some web shop for the first time, or just trying to send some charity money or something, you can easily be screwed. And this is not hypothetical, there have been multiple reported cases of extensions doing exactly this.
It would actually help a lot already if you could tell chrome to not auto-update extensions, that way one version could be peer reviewed, the code approved as safe by the community, and everyone could trust that judgement. But as it stands now, you never know whether  the owner of the app suddenly decides to turn evil and publish a bad update.

That is a use case for proving you own a specific paying address, nothing else. Proving this was always possible, by signing a message from the paying address, duh.
But you're not supposed to make multiple payments from the same address, so creating a central *one* identity based on *one* paying address makes absolutely no sense. 
And even if you do make all your payments from the same address - no, **especially** then - you should not try to connect all payments this way by using it as a single identity, for obvious privacy reasons.
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:23:38
Yeah, I suppose the wiki is wrong then, or not accurate enough. Depends on what they mean by "reverse".
The attacker can "reverse" transactions by making the blocks invalid that contain them, thus making it as if the transaction never happened. For me that counts as "reversed".
Bitcoin only takes the longest blockchain as valid. And someone with more than 50% than the rest of the network can always build the longest chain. If something happened 5 blocks ago that he doesn't like, he can just start mining at that point, creating a fork. It will take a while, but since he mines faster than the rest, eventually he will have the longest chain again.

Nope. Take all the exchanges for example. They make money, whether bitcoin grows or not. If people buy $1 million worth of bitcoin, an exchange doesn't need to care if a coin is worth $10 or $1000, they get their cut anyway and are profitable.

No, that is not "a major selling point for bitcoin". If you think it is, you have not understood anything. But this has become quite evident already anyway, hasn't it?


Again, no metric shows that. There are no numbers indicating that the number of bitcoiners are shrinking. On the contrary, there are lots of new accounts on coinbase etc every day.


"I'll continue making real money"? How exactly are you making money by being anti-bitcoin? Does someone pay you for making posts against it?
Oh, or do you mean by working? Like, "working", that thing that *everyone* else does too, Bitcoiners and me included, and which has absolutely no relevance here? Why would you feel the need to include that completely  irrelevant information? Maybe cause you damn well know I'm right and just felt better by going to that little defensive place where you can still imagine you're something better?
I am making money off **this**. And you and your little comedy friends, are not. And yeah, I'm talking about "real" money, assuming the simplistic definition you use for that is "fiat".

No, that is wrong. With &gt;50%, it's not probabilities, it's knowledge that you will succeed. 
If you have less than 50%, doing a 6 confirmation double spend has less chance of succeeding than a 3 confirmation double spend. And a 10 conf less than a 6 conf. Since with more than 50%, you build *faster* than the rest, you will always win the race. Time plays **for** you, not **against** you. And that becomes a fact right where you cross the line at 50%.

It is, but it has certain implications that we'll see unfold now. 
Only survival of the very fittest in the mining world. Possibly strong mining centralization. Possibly the price correcting upward as miners turn to buying coin instead of spending it on electricity, then correcting down again as miners start to mine again due to the higher price... Etc etc. The mining economy has changed a lot since the difficulty went down the last time, and I'm just quite interested in seeing how it'll handle all this.

All of my wat. Real adoption is exactly *the only thing* that is necessary for the price to go up.  Stop lying to yourself, there is just too little adoption to keep the price up. And yes, if there was *no* adoption at all, the price would be in freefall. 
Having said that, I still much rather see investments in the industry than "investors" buying a lot of BTC. Even though it means watching this sub piss itself over the price constantly.

My point is that you're incorrect. Neither gold nor Bitcoin have their value because of how much they're used. They have their value because of certain attributes that apply to them, especially their scarcity.

Everything below that is considered "uneconomic dust" and is rejected by the network. It's to prevent spam. 
The amount itself is somehow derived from the cost (in fees) to spend a TxOut/TxIn. I don't know how exactly.
Anyway, you would find that you couldn't send 0.0006 btc (so over the dust limit) for free either. You can often send big btc transactions for free, but small ones require a fee most of the time. Again, this is needed to prevent Spam. The bitcoin blockchain is an eternal, evergrowing ledger. If everyone could just add to it for free, it would be overflowing with spam and become unusable for anyone.
What that clearly demonstrates is that Bitcoin isn't the answer to microtransactions that some people want to paint it to be. Bitcoin is actually terrible for that.

Yes, exactly. But that is the selling point then. Not that it's a good conductor.

It's used sometimes in electronics *because it doesn't corrode* and because it is not a *bad* conductor.

"Fiat evaporates"?
While the gateway couldn't charge back the BTC they paid out, they still know the merchant with all his credentials. And they have a claim for the charged back amount. 
Have you ever witnessed a chargeback on paypal? What happens when you have no money on your paypal account and someone chargebacks a payment? This is exactly the same thing and the gateway would behave in the same way as paypal does, i.e. simply demand that you pay up.

You don't know what they do with their money. People often have misconceptions on how much money companies actually make. The chorus is always that they're raking in millions and millions of dollars, but you simply don't know how much they are spending. I don't know if you've been around for that, but Gox had multi-million dollar lawsuits to fight, and right after that started, their withdrawals stopped... a clear sign of solvency problems. And now half a year later, they still haven't recovered? An even clearer sign of solvency problems.
You might be right and it might turn out they're not insolvent. I don't believe that myself. But I'm telling you, **if** they are insolvent, it's definitely not because of this damn little malleability issue. Because that doesn't really cost any money.

What I said above is not completely correct, technically. It's a bit more complex. But it's the basic gist.
If you want to make a new Bitcoin code and more than 50% of the people agree and start using it, then that's the new Bitcoin code. The beauty and innovation of the system lies in how this consensus is found.

@_date: 2014-01-09 02:11:16


Well, no. In regular pools, all the coin-gathering happens completely off-chain. You do maybe one transaction to transfer out 1 BTC every few days, but you don't make a tiny transaction every 10 minutes. That's a big difference.


That's true to some degree. But I looked at it relatively already. If I assume that the fragmentation of big/small players for the 2% that P2P currently holds is the same for the rest of the network, then I can just take that times 50 to get to 100%. The values are probably off (maybe even a lot), but the general problem is still there.

The reason they're so big is cex.io.  Their highly profitable business. What does it matter who supplies the hash power to them? The problem is that they can afford to buy it in the first place. What do you think, that it's the government? Aliens?
The biggest part of their hash power still (allegedly) comes from the pool, not from the hardware they control. But they wouldn't be able to run a 0% pool if they weren't making so much money with cex. And people choose a 0% fee pool over one with a fee, what a surprise.

During and after 2008, precious metal prices soared. Since Bitcoin basically belongs in that class, I'd expect the same to happen to it if history repeats itself.
But that does in no way mean we should hope for it to happen. Some growth in Bitcoin does not make up for all the bad consequences these crises have on the world economy.
For the Great Depression: I'm not an expert on this (not even american), but I believe asset prices were artifically pumped up to begin with (during the [Roaring Twenties]( arguably due to the FED secretly breaking with the Gold Standard and pumping money into the system, mainly to finance World War I.

The whole reason we have the blockchain (= a timestamping service based on proof of work) is to establish consensus about "what happened when". But consensus is only found once per 10 minutes, when the person who mined the block says to everyone else "IT IS LIKE I SAY". Between that, everyone disagrees all the time about which transactions happened first, because everyone just sees them as they get them.

You wouldn't. The way I see it, there's absolutely no reason right now to have XCP - like, at all. 
Don't fall for someone who wants to sell his to you for a ridiculous price. 1 XCP literally equals 0.001 BTC. If someone wants you to pay a lot more than that (like 0.01 or 0.02), then it's a really dumb idea to buy.
I have still to see a convincing reason why XCP was created in the first place.

Good point. Western Union is usually used when time is the critical point. Paying out from an exchange to your bank account doesn't really achieve that. 
There are some exceptions though, like the other guy mentioned, Kraken deposits to Fidor accounts *very* fast usually (had it on my account within an hour or so).
The alternative, if you need the cash in hand fast (the same day), is to look for a trader on localbitcoins or mycelium.

Yes, it doesn't go from 50% to 100%, brainfart on my part.
But no, you don't have to assume the attack continues forever. The "important difference" here is that with &lt;50, your chance of succeeding with an attack approaches 0% the longer you time it, while with &gt;50, it approaches 100%. That is why it's definitely a significant barrier. *Time suddenly works for you.*

No idea what you're talking about here.
Bitcoin only believes in the longest chain. A person can not "claim one block only when the rest of the network accepts it". He can claim a block when his chain is the longest valid blockchain there is.
And there is no hard fork in the scenario of someone withholding 30 blocks. When he publishes, they're his, and up to 29 blocks from other miners get orphaned.
And there don't need to be any "malicious spends" (you mean double spends?) in there. A 51% holding entity could just do it to reap *all* block rewards. Since he can just orphan all competing miners, he'll get it all.

So if I have a secondary password active on my account, and I log into blockchain.info, the wallet is not yet unlocked? Only to the point that it knows what my addresses are etc? 
Any sources on how this is accomplished, technically? The way I usally look at wallets is that wallet = bunch of private keys. A client using an encrypted wallet decrypts it, then sees the private keys and from that, can tell you what addresses you use. How does a client do that that *doesn't* decrypt the private keys first?
Furthermore: If what you say is correct, that means it's not possible to import a blockchain.info wallet backup into another client (like multibit) without it needing your first **and secondary** password too?

This is not how that works. I suggest you try to actually learn something about the system instead of making outrageously naive claims like that.

Hashing power does not dictate what software (= protocol) other people run and support.
You can run your own modified bitcoin software, one where you set the block reward to 10000 btc. If you mine blocks that fit in this scheme, they are on a forked blockchain, because no one except you with your modified software will consider these blocks as valid. 
And it doesn't matter whether you dedicate all the hashing power in the world to this forked chain, because still, no one except you will care and consider it valid.

I agree that many bitcoiners are wrong to just assume that volatility will magically decrease, even though nothing guarantees that, like, at all.
But I still think there's a strong argument in that the longer bitcoin goes on, the more safe a store of value will people consider it. And *that* does lead to a decrease in volatility. It's the same process as with gold, only that gold has a few millennia headstart.
But I know that's not a fact, and we'll have to see if it really happens this way. Anyway, I personally don't care if volatility decreases or not. If you think that its volatilty means that bitcoin can't be successful, you're simply wrong, and have already been proven wrong by all of bitcoin's success so far. 
Just like there's no reason for people to assume that volatility will magically disappear, there's absolutely no reason either to assume that one day, everyone will go "Oh wait, shit, there's still volatility!" and then suddenly stops supporting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:54:14
No, that thread ended because of me being fed up with you not going into the actual argument and keeping to evase the point. 'Cause that's just what you do.
I originally answered to your claim that bitcoin use hasn't increased. That is just obviously wrong, and none of the stuff in the comment you linked proves otherwise in any way. So what if Bitpays numbers have not increased from a peak in November to December, but instead went down to a more sane level. Not that you could provide any proof of that, but even if? Then Bitcoin/Bitpay use has still increased a lot over the last year. And that was the whole point that I was making. Of course their numbers don't keep rising in an exponential curve. You said it yourself, there was Black Friday, holidays etc - that easily explains bloated numbers for that time. So one more time: Your argument that bitcoin use hasn't increased is just factually wrong. You cherry-picking single timeframes where use was exceptionally high and then using that to make the point that they're not that high anymore is just *ridiculous*.

Let's compare 2 schemes: 
The first one distributes **2.6 million XCP** for **2124 BTC** to **over 3000 people**, with the money being destroyed so no one profits from the initial mint.
The second one distributes **1 billion NXT** for **21 BTC** to about **70 people**, while the money is paid right into the developers pockets. 
One of those 2 is a nice idea with a fair start, the other one is a borderline scam.

There are about 6,000,000,000 ounces of gold in the world. Gold is currently valued at $1,237 per ounce.
So gold has a "market cap" of 7,422,000,000,000. Just for comparison. 
And yes, it's bullshit to assume that bitcoin would go anywhere near that valuation in the foreseeable future. Having said that, I don't think it's impossible that within just the next few years, Bitcoin could receive about 10% of gold's valuation. And that would still put it's value &gt;$50k.

True, but that would make it more of a placebo than actual security. Soon enough there would be a small program that you could run, even when you have no idea about the tech, that would steal the decrypted wallet within seconds, while your coworker is in the restroom.

Yeah, that's true.
Still, I'm not completely sold on the idea of mining and resource use working itself out completely automatic. Mining in Bitcoin was intented to secure the network - the problem is that there can be **too much** security. 
Because while mining ensures security, it also rewards people, there's no upper bound on the security that will be achieved, possibly resulting in an enormous waste of resources into securing something that would be secure at a tenth of the effort.

Sure, they might. Money laundering doesn't necessarily need to involve money. If you make any profit from crimes (selling drugs) in whatever form and are trying to turn that into legitimate money or assets, thus hiding your criminal actions, that's considered money laundering.

Look, what is or is not a currency is more of a philosophical debate than anything else. It might be pointless to get into this now, no dead horse has ever been beaten as much as this one here.
But I definitely agree with the argument that something that nobody actually wants to accept for payment, but only uses as a transaction system, is not a currency. It's a transaction system.
In your case, yes, if almost every purchase ever made with SEK would go like this, then I would say SEK isn't a currency either. But that's not the case, it goes the other way: SEK is already an accepted currency used in daily exchange by many people, and now *you* as a special case need to exchange it.
My stance is this: Bitcoin is not a currency, but it is money. The same way that I think gold is not a currency, but is money. If bitcoin really becomes a success, it might *become* a currency, just like gold *was* a currency.

I have no idea why you got downvoted. It's a legitimate question.
The way a hardware wallet works is that it shows you on a display the transaction that it is signing, and you have to manually confirm the transaction with the hardware. The hw then signs the tx and sends the signed tx back to your computer, where it gets published to the network. In this process, your computer never has the private key and can never ask the hw to get it.
So malware on your computer couldn't just steal your private keys or move all your bitcoins, because you'd need to confirm every payment on the hardware wallet. That's the whole point.
But there are still attacks possible. Smart malware on your computer could change all bitcoin addresses that you see on websites into other ones, controlled by the hackers. So then if you really *do* want to make a payment to someone, you would confirm the payment on the hw, not knowing that the address you're sending to is not the one it should be, because you never saw the correct one.

Legal tender is fiat. "Legal tender" means you are *forced* to take it as payment. Bitcoin is not, should not and will never be fiat.

@_date: 2014-07-15 12:05:11


I agree it can be a bit scary the first time, but it's really not that hard and very safe.
Just make a BIP38-password-encrypted paper wallet on bitaddress.org (password doesn't need to be super safe, more important that you don't forget it), print a page with 5 private keys or so. 
Then try the whole process out with the first of the keys: send a small amount of BTC there, look up the address on blockchain.info, wait until it has 1 confirmation. Then import the private key of that address back into a wallet (like the Mycelium app on your smartphone) and send the btc to a new address. If you got through that, just send the rest of your coins to the *second* address on the paper wallet, and strike the first one as the used (you should never reuse cold storage addresses).
Aside from that, I would assess that you can trust blockchain.info to a certain degree. The problem is, if they wanted to be evil, or someone forced them to be, it wouldn't be too hard for them to change the code so that when you visit their site, they would in fact read your password and be able to steal your coins. The chance for that is pretty low though.
A bigger concern to me when using Blockchain.info for long term storage is that you need to get rid of the backup they send you. Anytime you make a new address at blockchain.info, they send you an email with your wallet as a backup. **That wallet is not protected by 2FA, just by your password.** That opens up a big vulerability. Don't leave this backup on your email account, or on any online machine for that matter.

Oh, is that so?
You're right, I did actually make a mistake, for the value to triple, you'd obviously need 200% inflation, not 300% like I said. I wasn't really paying attention, sorry about that. Doesn't change that you're wrong though. 


That would be ~160% in 10 years. What you were originally saying would be 11.6% inflation per year (200% in 10 years). And again, this didn't happen.


No, we're talking about inflation. We're talking about price levels - so not "monetary inflation", just inflation, which means the general increase in price levels.


No they don't, and good thing I don't have to "believe it at my peril"; this data is freely available. 
[Banana price increase over the last 10 years: 77%](
[Rice price increase over the last 10 years: 73%](
[Oil price increase over the last 10 years: 130%]( - and oil is a really terrible indicator to use here.


We don't have to argue that the government CPI is bad and manipulated to look better. But still, you can't just make up numbers and believe it's reality. I seriously doubt you'd find any numbers that suggest a 200% general price increase over the last 10 years, because that is utter nonsense.
Anyway, my point here, talking about gold, is that its price is not just the result of it "holding its value" against inflation, it's the result of speculation and bubble behaviour.

When I write something on a piece of paper and then burn the paper, you can't say "well maybe with scientific advancement in a few hundred years, we have that information again".
Scientific advancement could theoretically make it possible in the future to *preserve* the information, so that it is *not* lost on death. But as it currently stands, we're not preserving that information, we're just freezing a chargeless lump of mass after the necessary information (the charge-state of the brain) is gone.

That blacking-out did absolutely nothing for your privacy, these addresses are still unique and easily found, even if you black out half of them.
Just enter the first half of your address on blockr.io and you'll still find that the full address is: 169tjC1KDnHHapFWW5a7Vjs8LBouBR5kB1
For the explanation: The transaction that send 0.16 btc to your address (the one on the top) also had 2 other outputs: one for 7.13 and one for 2 btc. So the same transaction that send btc to the top address also sent btc to the one in the middle and the one at the bottom. The total of all 3 outputs is the 9.29 you see on the left (origin).
What wallet did you use to send the 0.16 btc? Are you sure it was from a wallet, or was it from an exchange or something like that? Exchanges often pay out multiple people in a single transaction.

No, it means spending money that has already been spend. When doing that, you invalidate the first transaction. So someone abusing a double spend would, for example, make a transaction to buy a new car, then when he has the car, make a double spend transaction to himself. He then has the coins back and the car dealer got nothing. Only that this is really hard to pull off and a car would not be worth it - by far.

OK, let me explain what (I think) happened:
You talked to the BTCe support but apparently didn't realize what they were telling you. They told you this:


The message they apparently failed to convey to you is: "We have received a request to remove your 2FA. And now we have to wait 2 weeks for security before we can let anyone access the account without 2FA, **in case it was a hack and the owner of the account doesn't want to remove 2FA.**" 
And since you never made any such request to remove 2FA, all your alarm bells should have rang. What you should have done at this point is tell them: "What? I never requested removal of 2FA! DANGER DANGER!"
What happened is that someone hacked your email account, wrote a nice letter to BTCe ("Bohoo I have lost my 2FA device") then waited until the account was accessible without 2FA, and boom. 
I'm really sorry for your loss, but this happening is for the biggest part your mistake, for 
- not securing your email properly - but that's not that bad and can happen. That's what 2FA is for. The much worse part is  
- ignoring the explicit safety measures by BTCe to protect you from this. I suppose you didn't understand what they told you, which leads to your third mistake

Well that depends on the fork and what it entails.
We need a hard fork to increase the block size over 1 MB, for example. I doubt any miners would oppose that when it needs to happen.
But I suppose you're referring to a change to the mining process (hashing function etc). And yes, miners would definitely oppose that. That's the crux with such a consensus-driven system: you need pretty much everyone to agree, otherwise change can't happen.

These people are not selling money printing machines, they are selling Bitcoin miners. They are not in the business of speculating on bitcoin mining profitability, they are in the business of selling hardware. Saying "but they could just mine with it themselves" completely ignores that they would have huge logistic cost in organizing big mining farms, setting up the infrastructure etc, and *on top of that*, they would make the risky speculation that mining would stay profitable.
There's this analogy about selling shovels during a gold rush. It's exactly what they do. It *might* be more profitable for them to mine themselves, but by selling the hardware they go the zero risk way and take the profit immediately.
There's no sort of "proof" as you're implying with the title. It's just a shallow assumption that you're making.

*Bitcoin  
You see how they "keep being raised", but you just ignore how they have also been answered a million times?
"The difficulty of buying and selling them" - If that even really is an issue (it isn't for me or anybody I know), the problem is only a lack of infrastructure. If some new matter was found that could cure cancer by touch, but it's only found somewhere deep in the ocean, you would say "oh that's no good for curing cancer, it's hard to get it out of the ocean"
"the sheer complexity of the system that creates them" - you complain about people referring to the internet, but again, that's the most easily applicable analogy here. The internet is very complex, hardly anybody really understands the low-level architecture, but still billions of people can use it without any problems. In the same way, you don't need to understand bitcoin's code to use it. Having said that, the Bitcoin system isn't even that complex. The basic system is actually ingeniously easy. It's absolutely not comparable with the complexity of the current, insanely inefficient, global monetary system.
"the lack of any accountability or protection" - yeah, that's a basic property of bitcoin. Either you see how that in the same way is a *good* thing, or you don't. Yes, you can't go crying to mama - deal with it. But in situations where there's demand for such protection, it can be layered on top of bitcoin. If you want to remove the risk, you'll just still depend on third parties who'll swallow the risk. But the big bonus of Bitcoin is that you don't **have to** do that, and that in cases where you choose to do it, you'll get it much cheaper.
"and the deflationary nature of the security" - oh god, I'm just not going to start with that one. Discussed *a million times*. If your economic understanding (or lack thereof) tells you that an ultimately deflationary currency like Bitcoin is a bad idea in principal, *fine*. Go to one of the inflationary alt-coins and support those. They exist. And they contain the beloved inflation that "drives economic activity and promotes spending" or whatever you think why you need it.

Yes, reversing other people's transactions. Also complete control over what transactions or blocks you want to be valid. Including saying that ONLY your blocks are valid by orphaning all others, thus also getting ALL block rewards + fees for yourself.

@_date: 2014-08-04 16:33:50


Yes, you are. It's encoded in bitcoin transactions, following the open assets protocol. If you're interested, you should really just [give the specification]( a read, the protocol is pretty straight forward.
Look at [this transaction on the coinprism block explorer]( You can see, 100 units of "PhysX Gold" have moved here, together with 0.000106 BTC. 0.0001 BTC of that is the usual miner's fee, and the 600 remaining satoshi are actually transacted. Current bitcoin implementations consider everything under 560 satoshi dust and don't relay the transactions, that's why it has to be there - the coinprism developers just rounded it up to 600.
Look at [the same transaction on blockchain.info]( and scroll to the bottom. You'll see the line that blockchain.info calls "Strange", which reads:
    OP_RETURN 4f4101000264bc8c0600 
In that line is all the information coinprism uses ("what asset and how much of it is moved" + metadata). [Here is an example]( how this data is decoded.


They make normal bitcoin transactions, so they can't just randomly spam transactions for the same reason you can't do so for other bitcoin transactions: Fees.

Ok, first of all, that's merchant adoption, not user adoption. Merchant adoption has increased too, but more importantly, *user adoption* is not measured by *sales made in bitcoin*, but rather *number of bitcoiners*. And that number has been growing.


Ugh. "Almost zero", really? Even if that were true (it's not), I wouldn't care. This has absolutely no implication for the bitcoin price. That price is 99% speculation so far. If you really think that the few merchants accepting Bitcoin make its price, you haven't understood much.

I can definitely see how that is bad and I agree it should be forbidden, if the user doesn't explicity agree to it (does he have to with tidbit?).
The worst part is how terribly inefficient it is. The user on the site pays easily a 1000 times more for his visit in electricity than what the site owner gets for it. If the site would say "pay us 2 cents for your ad free visit", everybody would be better off - the site, the user, the environment.

If they were to buy so much bitcoin at once, it would drive the price up insanely fast, and they would lose a lot of money buying. Then later when they sell it all at once, they'd have the same thing in reverse, and *also* lose a ton of money, compared to dumping it more slowly.
Aside from that, what you said is possible. But it's not any different from anything else. It's done in variations on the markets everyday, all around the globe.

And even ignoring industrial use, with physical goods, it makes sense to have a good that has a lower weight-to-value quotient.

With cryptos, that makes no sense, you use the one that is most established, therefore most secure and that's that.

The 777 payments marked from [12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh]( all lead to addresses holding lots of coins (~10k each) that have all moved once in february and haven't moved since.
Like these: 
plus **117 others**. The timing makes sense and this is an amount of coins that is definitely suspicious. 
It's **more than a million bitcoins** with an obvious connection that haven't moved since february. Nobody except exchanges has that much coin, and this is not any other exchange. I highly doubt any exchange other than mtgox even has access to this much, and even if they had, the coins wouldn't just lie there for the last 4 months.
I think it's very much possible that this guy is right and these are mtgox' coins. It's not important whether the 12Nxd address is actually Karpeles' or not, the important part is the 120 addresses that are marked there.

Interesting idea. Not sure how much it will really be used, but *if* you really get miners to implement the logic to call your API and prefer the specific transactions, then great. I'm just not too confident this will happen easily, since the profit to gain is really marginal.

Fact is, their intentions don't matter. Good will doesn't save them from being shutdown, infiltrated or abused by people with guns (and possibly in uniforms).
GHash have a huge mining operation with hardware funded through CEX (hosted mining). That is where they make their money, and that is their own hardware. The mining from that probably makes up about 10% of the network by now. That is quite a lot, but still perfectly OK. But why do they need to also offer a 0% public pool? *Why??* It doesn't get them *any* money.

To beat any greater-than-zero number of required confirmations as an attacker, you need to mine faster than the rest of the network. So the higher you set the number for required confirmations, the longer an attacker needs to mine faster than the rest. It's the basic premise of Bitcoin that no attacker can do that.


The calculation assumes that it's not profitable for the attacker to withhold his block after a certain period of time, because the propability increases that someone else finds a block in that time. But if the attacker does the same trick with 10 other merchants, the time for which it's still stochastically profitable for him also increases by 10x.

Yeah, I know. But there's degrees, that's why I said "*more* ASIC-proof". The big problem with ASICs is the *huge* boost in efficiency they give, immediately rendering all general purpose computing power useless. 
I think there's also approaches that try to achieve true "ASIC-proofness" with memory requirements that *change* (increase) over time (like Vertcoin), meaning you'd have to either create new ASICs again and again or build them with the highest memory right from the start. If this is done right, while it might not make creating ASICs *impossible*, it might make them uneconomic to produce.




I've made this point a lot myself. But something Bitcoiners often like to argue is that it's an evolving protocol and that it can adapt to anything, yadda yadda. I believe there's big limitations to how adaptable it really is in the end. Changes which involve the slightest bit of controversy might never be implemented, even if they would be good - just because nobody wants to risk a hard fork of Bitcoin.

Impressive, you're able to calculate an average. Math is a wonderful thing. If you use it to compare the 28k to the rest of their income, you'd find that this is about 1% of their total daily revenue (based on past years), which is **very** good, much more than I would have expected.


Are you kidding? You're pulling assumptions right out of your ass and are inferring stuff that isn't there just so that it fits your negative point of view. You're not using any numbers to prove your point, you're just lamenting that you're missing them. "Bitpay isn't publishing more numbers so they're clearly down." That's logic for you, huh?


Oh shit, must be a conspiracy.
And did the average daily number increase over the year or did it decrease or stagnate? We're not arguing here over absolute numbers, you're arguing that **the numbers are not increasing** which is just plain and objectively **wrong**.
From the data that we actually have and are not wildly making up, we know that the use is clearly *increasing*. It's definitely not huge, but nobody is arguing that. Denying that adoption is happening though is just plain ignorant.

The current operating state of the computer is lost forever when the electric signal stops, yes. Computers have booting routines that let you restart them and create a **new** operating state by relying on data they take from the HDD.

If someone used malleability to change the tx id, the outputs would still be spent. So if they had been checking it this way, it wouldn't have been exploitable.
And yet still, even with this way: What do you consider "spent"? When it gets taken into a block? And what if it's not in a block yet, do you just refund every transaction that isn't confirmed yet? That doesn't work.

You're absolutely right. I hadn't really thought it through when I made that comment. 
This increase does in no way help the rounding "problem", which is of course intentional. I wouldn't call them "idiots" because of that though, since it's definitely on purpose. Nobody is stupid enough to implement "rounding up to cents" by mistake or ignorance, when developing a trade engine. So they're not "idiots", but maybe a bit deceitful. Considering how I've noticed that they also screw Euro users on the exchange rate, it's not really surprising.

I make 2 transactions. The first I put on a timestamp dated back 15 minutes, the second now. I address the second one to a merchant and push it to the network, then send the first, "earlier" transaction addressed to myself.
How would the network know which timestamp is real? How would the merchant know if the transaction he got is the real deal, and that there doesn't exist a transaction with an earlier date in the network?
When a node gets a transaction, it has no way of knowing when the timestamp in that transaction was set. It doesn't know if it's the first node that gets the transaction, or if it has been hopping around the network for a while already.
This timestamping is exactly the problem the blockchain solves; as Satoshi says in the [whitepaper]( it's: 


timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions

On the gold standard, dollars were not fiat. By definition.
If we have a bitcoin standard later, and the government demands we pay them in dollars backed on bitcoin (which doesn't make much sense) then sure... why not.
And if the dollars are not backed by bitcoin and continue to be pure fiat, then no, the government will start accepting bitcoin for taxes. We're talking about a world here where everyone takes bitcoin and doesn't value dollars; what would the government want with them? They would be worthless.

With credit cards, the error is not on the user side, it's a problem of the system itself. You're exposing the required authentication code for a transaction to everyone that you want to transact with. That has nothing to do with user error, you *have to* do this if you want to use the system. 
So no, I'd say it's right to say that Credit Cards as a payment system are insecure, and that the blockchain as a transaction ledger is secure. Mind though, however, that's not the same as saying "Bitcoin is secure", that's a statement so broad it could never be true.

I'm just speculating, but I'm fairly sure. This is true for most bigger businesses: they don't start to accept BTC because they want to change the way they're investing their money. Bitpay offers them a riskless way to serve Bitcoin users and so they do it. Get some free advertising and dollars on the bank.
Again, I have no proof for this here, but when I see regular businesses starting to accept Bitcoin via Bitpay, I assume (and am fairly sure that) they exchange it for fiat.

I don't really see my point at all addressed there. I'm not talking about a "Google  Attack", I don't need to outperform the resources by the storj network. I could run 10 thousand virtual nodes @ 10 MB storage space, and would just need 100 GB storage space.
I can start that up, gather data, then shut down all nodes, delete everything and start again. Everytime I repeat this process, there's a more or less good chance that I delete all copies of some data chunk.
Is *that* actually addressed somewhere?

1: Yes. It's good practice to always completely sweep your cold storage addresses if you need them. The BTC you don't need, you put on a new address. That's why it's best when you're making paper wallets to just print a whole bunch of them.


Just to be clear about this: It's only tainted in the sense that your phone could maybe be compromised or something. You don't just automatically reveal your private key by sending BTC.
2: When you import keys into Mycelium for example, you only have to enter the BIP38 phrase once, then the key is imported and you can just access the address normally. But basically, because of what I said in (1), that should only happen once anyway.

Maybe it came across that way, but that wasn't at all what I wanted to say. Had already edited the original post to clarify that.
My point was that there is no evidence that there's actually a connection between NSA and heartbleed. The NSA denying that such a connection exists doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, but it means that there's no confirmation of such a connection. If they had said "Oh yeah, we knew about this bug all along", that would be one thing. But if they deny it, there should better be some actual evidence for claims that there is a connection, otherwise it's just empty blabber aiming for pageviews.

It's a more accurate description of bitcoin velocity than just taking "Bitcoin transferred" for example. If you send your 1 bitcoin back and forth 100 times between 2 of your own addresses, you have created a volume of "100 bitcoin transferred", which is kind of a pointless thing to observe, since it was just 1 bitcoin that actually moved. 
But the bitcoin days destroyed metric doesn't increase notably here after the first transaction because the coins were not stored for any time.

Admin was a girl (- now deleted) that was also often to see on the sub (and thus taking tips). Maybe that clashed with reddit's rules.. She probably apologized and they reopened the sub. Maybe someone else is the admin now, or just "*someone else is the admin now, wink wink*". I really don't know much about the details.
Taking a look at the sub now, I actually think [this]( is her (with a new username and a glorious antminer). Few on that sub are more than camwhores, but fawkesy actually knows her shit with bitcoin.

Well, we hope so, sure.
But it might be a long time until then. Basically until Bitcoin has reached such a global consensus that it is relatively stable.


When that happens, there will be complete chaos and nobody will know how to price anything. Same question would be "how will they price their goods in gold, or silver, or cigarettes?". It's a process, and it wouldn't be pretty. Lots of bartering and unfair deals.

Relatively, about $2k. Nothing compared to the profits I made prior to that though. 
There were so many red flags about gox, I had actually stopped using them completely for 6 months prior to their downfall. But when they stopped BTC withdrawals and the price went down to 1/5th of the price on other exchanges, well, I got greedy. Couldn't imagine they'd come out and say they lost all those coins (it's ridiculous still). When the price is 1/5th of elsewhere, the market is basically assessing an 80% chance that the coins would never come out. I thought that wasn't realistic and took the bet. Risk vs reward. That time it didn't play out, other times it did.

That is only true **if** they appreciate somewhat. That's not a given.
My point is that there is a distinction between 2 business activities here:
A. Mining bitcoins  
B. Speculating on the future value of Bitcoin
People who engage in business A can do so for a profit, without engaging in B. People who do B can do so for a profit, without engaging in A. The two don't inherently depend on each other. 
And I would assess that someone who is *heavily* involved in A already isn't necessarily interested in increasing his risk exposure by also engaging in B.

It could just as well be 30%, 50% or 70%, it doesn't matter, because that thing is never going to be profitable. And they're not planning to actually make it profitable.

You can use a bank like a "normal" person to store your bitcoin keys safely, if you don't trust yourself to do that (which is actually pretty easy). You can even encrypt them before you give them to your bank so that even though they hold the encrypted key, they could never take your coins away from you. This is not something you can say about your regular money, which is nothing but easily forgeable entries in centralized databases.
But, I suppose from the rest of your posts here, that you're just trolling and have no interest in learning anything. So there's probably no point in explaining this to you.

Right, it matters as much for the auction as his comment about "btc quantity bid", not at all. I never said it matters for the auction. 
It matters only for our information. And contrary to the "btc quantity bid", the information wouldn't be completely useless. 
If he says "we have bids for 1 billion btc, wooooah, look how big that number is!", it doesn't actually mean anything. The bids can all be for $0.01 per btc for all we know. 
If on the other hand, he says "we have a total bid sum of $1 billion" then that actually demonstrates lots of capital interested in the coins.

Agreed. Some people think these stupid standard clauses in ToS mean a company can do whatever it wants.

Block times may have made sense to be this high in the beginning (dunno, I wasn't around then). The network was small, maybe propagation was slow, and it was all just experimenting anyway. Definitely understandable to set it high first, but could have been optimized later on.
The block halving on the other hand is something that, in my opinion, never made sense to begin with. It's just a bad design decision.

What he was complaining about is that if you set up a 20 BTC sell wall, and someone buys up your btc in small pieces, then you pay a lot more in fees than if you had just been able to sell all at once. You have no way of affecting how your wall gets eaten.
And the fraud part comes in if you imagine that Bitstamp might artificially split up bigger orders too. If someone wants to buy 2 of your 20 BTC, they make it look for **you** like it was actually a ton of tiny orders. But I don't think there's any evidence yet for this claim being true. 
Wouldn't surprise me though. Unregulated markets guys, everybody grabs what they can. **We** need to force Bitstamp to either up the minimum to $5, or add decimal places and/or proper rounding in their calculations.

@_date: 2014-11-06 09:44:24
This is not really a new worry, but it's a totally negligable weakness. The more the network grows, the less likely are big drops in hashrate. Even if the biggest datacenter burns down, it makes for a relatively small drop in overall hashrate.
And in the unlikely event that hashrate would drop so immensly that a retarget is not in sight like in your scenario - this could happen for example if the price dropped extremely in a very short period -, we'd easily get consensus for a fork that would do a single artificial difficulty lowering.


That's why it's important that mining is spread widely over the globe, i.e. the more decentralized, the better. You say it wouldn't be difficult for world governments to shut it down, all governments of the world cooperating like that... they don't get that done for *anything*, let alone for something so abstract and new as Bitcoin. And as long as not all governments cooperate to eliminate mining, no single government has an incentive to do so, since all it would do is drive money out of the country.

It's interesting, but I think the big issue with that calculation is that it's only valid if the attacker only tries to attack 1 target at once.

Yes, that isn't possible. Bter or other online exchanges are not wallets, they don't allow you to just import private keys. 
The process is harder with alt-coins like Litecoin. With bitcoin, what I'd do is use Mycelium wallet for Android or blockchain.info.
But your safest way is just to do it with an actual client on your computer. Get the litecoin-qt client, go into the console (Help-&gt;Debug Window) and enter 


with your priv-key and optionally a label for the address. Your wallet should import the key and your balance will show. Then you can send the money to Bter (or wherever)

Gold has a long history of being reliably and highly valued. Bitcoin doesn't have that yet, it's new and still valued very low.
But I personally believe that doesn't mean much. Horse carriages where used for a long time, that didn't mean they weren't gone within a few decades after the first cars showed up.
I believe gold will always be somewhat valuable (even if just for the fact that it's physical), but I'm very confident crypto-currencies will replace most of its main features in the long run.

It's as if someone keeps shitting where you're going. It doesn't really stop you from walking, but it sure is unpleasant.
This thread is a perfect example. Google asks "What should we do with **Bitcoin**?" And of course, the doge kids come along and say "HeY why no doge?! Such currency much wow hahahahahahahaha". And then they actually vote-raid it to the top, just like they vote-raid this thread.
The damn hypocrisy is the worst about it. On the one side you preach that it's so fresh and new and will be the new super big alt-coin etc, but when someone points out that you're never going to be taken seriously, you say "pah, we don't want to be taken seriously. we're just a lighthearted community blahblah". What a load of nonsense. Do you want to grow big or do you want to be a worthless joke? Make up your fucking mind.

Literally everything you said is wrong.


No, you don't. The colored coins are not bound to any specific bitcoins. You're just using the bitcoin protocol to move the colored coins. Every open asset transaction costs 600 satoshi, but that doesn't mean that 1 colored coin = 600 satoshi, or that if you move these 600 satoshi, that the owner of the asset has changed.
Everybody who's interested in the details can (and should!) read [the specification]( It's not really that complicated.


It's enforceable just like every other goddamn contract on this planet.

The problem is that "minor crimes" covers such a huge amount of irrelevant crap, so that when they want to, they'll find something to pin you down.
Also, Mtgox was not the one doing the "serious crime" here. They were just used. Do you think they should have anticipated that they'll become a pawn in the Feds SR-chase?
I don't know if you've been around when the original news came out that $5 million of Mt.Gox were seized by the Feds, but it was bad. It created a lot of bad feelings about Bitcoin, many interpreted it as somewhat of a war declaration by the US government. And rightfully so - because if we don't know the background they were hiding here, what else were we supposed to think? They directly attack a normal business over some technicality? Stinks to high heaven. And just now we find out that really, it was just them chasing SR money, and it had absolutely diddly squat to do with Mtgox.

First of all, I don't believe it solves a problem that exists. Centralized storage will by nature always be more efficient (that means less resource intensive and in the end cheaper), and I don't see much reason to decentralize it. Encrypted storage, yes. But decentralized, *why*?
Second of all, I have yet to be convinced that it's even possible. As far as my intuition goes, the system is completely attackable. How much redundancy is enough for the data? 3x? If I'm an attacker and create 1000 nodes on my one computer, acting like seperate entities (aka a sybill-type attack), and on 3 of my nodes is where your data gets saved, and then I say "poof" and turn these nodes off forever and delete your data, you'll never see it again. So 5x redundancy, 10x? I just increase the size of my attack and will always have a certain chance to be the only one storing one person's data. And as someone doing that, I have no cost prohibiting me from doing it (like I would have in Bitcoin trying to attack the proof-of-work system). In fact, I even get paid for it.
There's talk from the Storj guys solving this by doing statistical analysis of some sorts etc, but I believe these things can always be gamed.
In general, I think it's great that research is being done in this area, but I don't see a point to it. If they succeed in securing it and ensuring that the data is never lost (I can't possibly see how), then it will be by creating huge overhead over simple centralized alternatives, with no additional benefits.
Decentralizing things is *cool* from a technological point of view, but to be useful it needs to have a point. Decentralizing things is only necessary if there's some threat, someone who could abuse their power over the centralized system. For sharing files of possibly illegal nature, that threat is there. Hence Bittorrent. For money, that threat and potential for abuse is very much there. Hence Bitcoin. Where is that threat in cloud storage? I don't see it.

No, that is wrong. The base confirmation time is always 10 minutes, independent of the difficulty.
While hashrate is growing (so between the difficulty readjustment every 2016 blocks), you have *faster* confirmation times. When it is dropping like it was now, you have *longer* confirmation times. So OP is technically right, it does cause longer confirmation times. But it's barely noticeable with such a small decrease.

Nonsense. That is not how it works at all. Like miners yell at us "we need more fees, give us more fees" and then people have to follow. 
They get the fees that they get, and either it is still profitable for them to keep mining, or they will stop mining, thus decreasing difficulty and increasing the reward for the rest. It will just balance out. Whether in the end there will be enough miners to remain a secure network is a different topic. But there are decades to figure this out before this issue becomes in any way relevant.

Waah. That is just wrong. 
You can put the "transaction processing" under mining. Mining involves hashing, but hashing definitely is not in any way the "transaction processing".
Hashing means calculating hash values through a [hash function]( - in bitcoin's case: [SHA256](
In the context of bitcoin mining, it means repeating that function as often as possible and hoping to get lucky that the random, unpredictable outcome of the hash function is lower than a certain value (the [target]( When that happens, the miner has won 25 bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-06-18 12:52:59


Well, I don' think 1.2m BTC were ever burned, more like a few thousand.
Anyway, it's all about the distribution of a new altcoin. If you want to have a fixed supply of, say 10m whateverCoins, and want that distributed right at the start, you have a few options. All not optimal. 
You can try to distribute it for free, everyone who says "yeah, gimme!" before launch gets a few whateverCoins. Problem is, people will cheat: create hundreds of accounts just to get as much as possible, etc. 
A better option is to sell it, so that the people getting the initial supply have paid for it. But that means the developers of the new coin get a lot of money for doing basically nothing. There have been a lot of scam coins doing this IPO-style distribution, taking in the money and then just disappeared. 
That's why some went with proof-of-burn: people need to pay, but the money doesn't go to some person that doesn't deserve it, but gets destroyed instead. You get whateverCoins in the amount proportionally to how much BTC you destroyed. That way, the developers don't have incentive to just create the coin and then disappear, but instead they have to invest like everyone else and then work to make the coin valuable.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:59:21
It's because it's not actually that colored coins represent bitcoins (or fractions of bitcoins). Colored coins are only represented and traded via bitcoin *transactions*.
When I create 100k of some asset, I do it like [here]( (and [here]( is the same tx on bc.info). 
The amount of actual bitcoin transacted there is 600 satoshi, but that amount is irrelevant. What counts is that into this transaction is written: "With this transaction, I create 100k of asset XYZ". And for the coinprism protocol, that means it's created, and henceforth, that address is the issuer of XYZ and it has 100k of XYZ on it.
Now I can make another transaction to another bitcoin address. Again, the amount of bitcoin moved is 600 satoshi. But into that transaction is written: "I hereby move 20k of XYZ". And for the coinprism protocol, that means that henceforth, the issuer address only has 80k XYZ left and the other address now has 20k.
Only the owner of the issuing address can issue more XYZ, everyone else can only send them around. There's also new functionality to automatically distribute dividents to asset holders, I haven't looked into that yet.
Hope that clears it up a bit ;)

What a decentralized exchange would try to do is *not* have someone "collect the deposits". When I wanted to buy Bitcoin from you, I would send you the money directly to your bank account. The problem now is just that I'd need to prove without doubt to *the system* (not some individual escrow people) that I made this fiat transfer to you. 
And that is not possible, because fiat is just not bound to some mathmatical proof like crypto-currencies are.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:44:08
It's not about free advertising. Maybe to some degree, yeah. But the main point is that if I have Bitcoin and I want to pay them, all I see is other options. Unless I go on a dedicated search to find out they take it, I'll end up paying another way. 
How do you even get to this page if you don't follow this link over reddit? I seriously have no idea.
And then in a few months when everybody has forgotten this reddit thread and the secret easter-egg-page where to donate btc, they'll close it down because they claim they're not getting enough. Fuck that. If you have a donate page that lists the payment methods you take, then list all the damn payment methods that you take.

No it doesn't. The security of *those people* and their access to their money depends on them choosing truly random keys and R-values. When you find a reused R-values, you're not going to "hack the blockchain", you haven't found a "flaw in the blockchain". You are able to exploit 1 specific address that was created by an insecurely behaving user. 
The security of the blockchain as a timestamped transaction log has never been affected. It works exactly as it was always supposed to. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:50:26
Almost definitely, yeah. Especially considering that, like everybody else, they couldn't get the money out of Gox, heh. 
But that doesn't change much. Those coins go on the free market.  Even if it's an institutional investor that buys it, that investor would otherwise have to get the coins somewhere else, for example the exchanges. And someone who got the coins in the auction for a relatively low price could just move them to exchanges over time. So even if it might not push the price down much, it could very well put a big fat ceiling on the price for a long time.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:44:19
I don't like that they invented an altcoin that comes with it. I don't think it's necessary, and it's unfair. The whole XCP thing leaves a bitter taste.
Also, colored coins are merely supposed to be "decentralized assets", just like Bitcoin is "decentralized currency". What counterparty tries to do is be a "decentralized *exchange*", so to Bitcoin that would be the equivalent of a "decentralized mtgox". Which is certainly nice to have, but I still like more the approach of first providing easy to use decentralized assets as individual tokens. Different forms of exchanges could come after that. It's not so disastrous to have decentralized assets and be trading them on centralized exchanges, it's what we still do with Bitcoin, after all.
Having said that, it was months ago (years in bitcoin-time) that I looked at counterparty, basically when it just came out. Before I dismiss it, I should have a look at it again. But I'm sure as hell never going to buy or use a single one of their altcoin. If that's a necessity, count me out.

I know too little about sidechains to explain them sufficiently, but here's what I can tell you about colored coins:
First of all, the term "colored coins" has been used for different implementations, but the basic idea is to "color" a bitcoin, or fraction of one, so that it represents something else. If you encode relationships, movement etc of assets in the permanent public ledger that is the blockchain, you can create and manage any virtual asset you want. What these virtual assets are worth however is, as with Bitcoin, up to the people that want to have them.
The most advanced and user-friendly implementation, [Coinprism]( however doesn't really color a fraction of a bitcoin, so it's wrong to imagine that you have 0.0001 bitcoin and now that 0.0001 btc represents "one reddit note". Instead, it just encodes in a transaction the creation and movement of assets. This is done by following the [OpenAssets protocol]( 
To start your own colored coin, you'd create a special issuing transaction to an address you control yourself, in which you encode *"I hereby create 1 million FrankehShares"*. You only spend for that transaction pretty much the absolute minimal amount allowed to be sent by the bitcoin network (600 satoshis). From that moment on, every bitcoin client that is not "colorblind" can recognize that this address does not just contain some bitcoin, but also 1 million FrankehShares. You can then make another transaction to *my* address in which you encode *"I hereby move 200k FrankehShares to this address"*. Again, you're just actually moving 600 satoshi, but since you follow the protocol, every color-seeing client can tell that you have also moved the FrankehShares.
That's pretty much the concept. The rest just builds on top of it. I think you can also pay out dividends now with coinprism, so you would just put the 10 BTC profit of your company (or whatever) to be paid out to investors, and it would automatically be split up to the holders of your shares, proportionally to how much they have.
Here's an [example asset that I created]( lemme know if you want some, I got plenty :P

To a certain degree, that's true. A single conf in such an altcoin is better than 0 conf in bitcoin. But it's far from as good as a single conf in bitcoin. 
There's also a reason you can't have too low a value for the block time. You can't just make the block time 10 seconds, because there would be no consensus - the blockchain would fork constantly. 
Something like 2 minutes works, but then still, you'd still have to uncomfortably wait around, so the problem isn't solved. Whether you have to stand around 2 minutes or 10... it's both not acceptable in PoS.

In between blocks, miners gather all (valid) incoming transactions and hold them in their mempool. Which of those get into a block is up to the miner.
So if the miner sees 1500 transactions in his mempool that want to be confirmed, but only 1000 fit into the block, he'll obviously take the ones that pay the highest fees. And if he was a minute ago trying to make a block that contained transaction A, but now learned about a transaction B that pays a higher fee, he'll include B instead.
As long as the average block size is below the max block size, there will only be a temporary backlog that will clear in less busy times. If blocks are however consistently full, low fee transactions will never confirm.

@_date: 2014-10-10 00:30:33
There's a couple things wrong here. I know you want to keep it simple, but you shouldn't be misleading. First of all, inputs or outputs are not addresses. You can (and very often do) have two different inputs coming from the same address. Any input you use is just an output from an earlier transaction someone sent you. So if Alice sent you 1 BTC, and Bob sent you 2 BTC, both to the same address, you'd have two corresponding inputs to use for your own transactions. 
I'd say a more fitting description of what an input is, is that it's *a signed link to a previous output.* You show to the network what output you are trying to spend, then give a signature (by using your private key) that proves that you are actually allowed to spend it.
The other important thing to understand is that inputs always have to be spent in full. Every input you take has to be completely turned into an output - every amount of bitcoin that didn't turn into an output is considered by the network to be your fee to miners.
That means you can't take a 2 BTC input from your wallet, leave 1 BTC where it is and just take 1 for your transaction. You have to take the full amount. And if you want to keep 1, you'll have to have an output with 1 BTC to an address you control (can be the same address where it is coming from). So a transaction would look like this:
                   ------ output(1BTC) to whoever you're paying
                 /
    input(2BTC)-
                 \
                   ------ output(0.9995BTC) back to yourself ("change")
                   ------ miner's fee(0.0005BTC): this is not actually contained in any output, 
                                                  it's just what you didn't spend of the input

But that's not what fiatleak is showing. Showing how much Bitcoin are mined and their value at current spotprice - **that** would be a more accurate description of the "fiat leak" (still wrong though).
But instead, the site just takes every sale of Bitcoin and acts like it is fiat "moving into Bitcoin" (whatever that is even supposed to mean). If I wanted to show the opposite, I could make the exact same site and say it shows "how much money moves **out** of Bitcoin". 
The whole thing is pretty pointless if you ask me.

What he's implying is that pools give miners ranges of nonces to search. I'm not entirely sure that's how it works, but if it does, it's not simply probabilistic. To detect, the pool can give the miner a small range in which it knows is a valid solution.

If you value coins &lt;$100 still, that's fine. The market disagrees. But what does this have to do with other people being "emotionally attached"? I have evaluated Bitcoin a long time ago and set price targets well above $10k. In my opinion, it's backwards to be invested in bitcoin and think the price "should be" somewhere below $100. That just doesn't make much sense.

Miners are not the ones the coins get distributed to, they are the ones distributing.
By design, mining costs a lot of money, in the optimal case close to the price of Bitcoin. That means miners will always have to sell their coins on the exchanges to cover their expenses. That means that newcomers have coins to buy, and it keeps the price leveled =&gt; distribution.

Yeah, if they are stupid.
If mining is unprofitable, you BUY bitcoin, and don't keep mining in hopes that the price will rise again - that doesn't make any financial sense.
Additionally to following the most basic logic, this has the additional effect of potentially helping the price to rise.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:38:28
Yes, though it would be ugly if people had to organize themselves into equal sized pools. They would have no incentive to do that, which would instead make them go with the biggest pool because it has the most regular payouts, yadda yadda, same situation. 
But I think this could possibly be integrated somehow into the current P2Pool system, so that it handles that automatically. A miner that connects to P2P would then be assigned to one of a number of sub-pools. The number of pools could be reached by the average time p2p needs to find a block. The faster it finds blocks, the more sub-pools are necessary. 
I need to think some more about this when I have time.

For one, they make and sell thousands of these miners. *Running* them is something entirely different. Doing that requires setting up huge infrastructure only for the purpose of mining. Big storing spaces, cooling, cheap and plenty electricity, security and a hundred other things are to consider.
The other thing is that someone who builds AND runs the miners assumes all of the risk of bitcoin value. If the value plummets or bitcoin fails completely after, say, 2 months or so of mining - they'll never make the money back.
So a company that manufactures *and* mines is not simply in the business of "building and selling a specific machine", but also in that of "running a huge bitcoin mining operation" and in "speculating on the value of bitcoin".

That's why you don't have other "100% proof of stake coins". It's not like that was not possible before or anything like that. It wasn't done because the whole idea is completely stupid and makes it one big scam.
It wouldn't even be so bad if initial distribution was handled in a proper way. But there was 1 billion NXT initially distributed for 21 BTC. TWENTY-ONE! That means 1 single bitcoin bought 47 million NXT. And just when the coin is released and hasn't accomplished anything, these 47 million should be worth (with current market price 0.000084 btc) almost **4000** bitcoin. The initial distribution went to 73 addresses, god knows how much of those are even the same person. Just nope.
Also, one of the main developers I see making **outrageous** claims, like "NXT will be easily $100 by the end of the year". That would make it about 8x worth more than Bitcoin. **Ridiculous**. Just empty pump, pump, pump.
It's a scam. One of the better ones, and it's a long con, but still definitely a scam. Don't fall for it.

The problem from Russian's viewpoint here is that there wasn't a legitimate government in Ukraine. That's what started this all.
There's no decision "entirely up to the people of Ukraine", that's exactly the problem. "The people" *never* have a say in this. And this particular decision will now be made by a government that came into action by force. Their decisions will be pro-west, which is what we wanted. Under no other circumstances would we have celebrated this coup d'etat in our media like this, as if the "revolutionaries" were not a violent bunch of nationalist nutjobs.
Don't get me wrong though, it's not like the Russians didn't had it coming. Like them taking Snowden (or maybe even paying him right from the start, if you want to believe that) ... that was such an open provocation against the U.S., there *had* to be consequences. 
There's really too much to talk about here, and it's not the place and the language for me.
Let me just say this: All of these political bullshit shenanigans, with people voting over a tiny island and a whole country being torn apart in a bullshit argument about whether they're more "pro-west" or "pro-russia" - like a bunch of children - this stuff is exactly why I hate the concept of nation-states.

To add to the comment from It would still, like you suggested, be better if you could have a different receiving address each time. But since you can't always change the address you're giving on i.e. your youtube video, how could this be accomplished?
The answer is: [hierarchical determinstic wallets]( something that will hopefully sooner than later dramatically change the way we use Bitcoin. When you have HD wallets, you can put your HD public key into your youtube video, and someone who wants to send you money can generate a bitcoin address from that. The next one generates a different one, and so on. With the one private key/seed accessing the HD wallet, you then have access to *all* the addresses that wallet can generate. From just looking at the blockchain, there is no connection between those addresses, only you know how much you received.
This has many applications and is a really interesting concept. You can also imagine a webshop that wants to take Bitcoin. You want to automate the payments, so that the shop can give out fresh addresses to customers to pay, but you don't want the shop to hold the private keys to those addresses at all, because that's a huge security risk. HD wallets allow that kind of thing.
edit: Yeah, sorry, forget the second paragraph, I had it backwards, donations are not where HD wallets are handy. Since they are deterministic, people would just create the same sequence of addresses to donate and it would just render the whole thing pointless. HD wallets are still a great thing to read up on.

If a population eats a certain amount of potatoes, then suddenly the farmers can only supply half of what they could before, damn right the price has to increase. Same demand, less supply. But we don't consume bitcoins. Old coins can all be traded just like the day they were mined. It means there is a constant *increase* in supply, so there has to be an *increase* in demand to sustain the price. 
"All else being equal" like you said does not mean the price will rise. The increase in supply giving by bitcoin mining is a natural constant. The increase in demand necessary to sustain it is not. Acting like it is is what I mean with "wishful thinking". It's an expectation, not a purely rational rule.
I guess my point is that the question whether the price rises or falls is not answered to such a significant degree by the block reward as some people want to make it out to be, it's primarily answered by how much adoption there is.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:58:20

The attacker didn't log in into your account, so of course that doesn't show up. They sent an email from your (hacked) email address to btc-e, requesting 2FA to be disabled. Btc-e then disables your account for 2 weeks (from around Feb 15th to March 1st).

I think I know what you mean, but that was no proof, just misinformation. 
"Others disclosing their bids" here refers to secondmarket bidders disclosing their bids. But what secondmarket did was take a bunch of bidders, who were bidding for relatively small numbers of coins, and bundle them into one single bid, since bids could only be for 3000 BTC minimum. 
What we saw here was secondmarket bidders saying "I bid $675 for my coins, so Tim Draper's bid must have been higher". But that is simply not true. If the secondmarket bidder bid $675 only for 1000 coins, and the remaining 2000 coins only had bids of $200, secondmarket would take the average and bundle the bids into one single bid for the 3000 coins at ~$358.
The only way we could deduce the minimum auction price is if we had a collective sum of the highest bids for a total of 3k BTC via secondmarket, where their weighted average is then the minimum auction price. But we don't have that. All we have is a few small time bidders saying how much they bid - that alone tells us nothing.

No, the price is zero if you sell it *for zero*. If you can't sell it making a profit, that just means your price wasn't low enough. And if you try to give it away for free and *nobody* "buys" it, then that doesn't mean the price is zero either. Suppose you're selling nuclear waste. Then maybe the price is negative and you have to **give** someone money to take your good.
When you're not able to sell something, you can arrive at the **subjective** conclusion that your good has no **value** (value always being a subjective statement) and that it's not worth it to keep lowering your ask price. But you can not say that your good has no **price** (price always being an objective statement).

Say there are 1 billion US dollars (for the sake of argument), and that is further indivisible. Now you come and want to sell your toenails, but think that 1 dollar is too much for that, so you divide that dollar into cents, and sell your toenails for 1 cent each. How is that not an increase in the money supply of US dollars?
Answer: because it just fucking isn't. When you split an apple in smaller apple-pieces, you don't have more apples. You have not increased the apple-supply. When you split something of n value into x smaller pieces, you haven't magically created x*n value, but x pieces of n/x value each.

No, it means she missed out on like hundreds of thousands of bitcoins (if that is even true, which I highly doubt) when they were worth practically nothing.

You shouldn't blur sensible information (like private keys) in pictures. Do it as you have done with the QR code and the tx id and paint over it **completely**. 
There are ways to "unblur" this stuff. It's not easy, and most of the times probably not worth the effort - but it's possible. Just for having posted this publicly, if I were you I'd move the coins away from that address.

The most important and easy thing to keep in mind is this:
You access your bitcoins by using a private key. When you have the private key to your coins and no one else has, then you have your coins.
Putting coins in "cold storage" can be as easy as you writing down a private key and deleting every trace of it from your computer.

My guess would be that the attacker requested this long before you asked the support. Any email confirming that would have of course been deleted by him. So when they said "the account is locked for 2 weeks", they didn't mean 2 weeks *from now*, but 2 weeks from the moment it was locked.

The price is always the last successful trade. If I make a trade now for $800 and no other trade happens for a year, the current bitcoin price is still $800.

Pretty much like that, but they don't need to phish your password if they have your email. They can just use the "lost password" function and reset the password via email. 
When they control your email, all they need to get out of the way is the 2FA.
So in my head, the chain of events would go somewhat like this:
- they get access to your email, god knows how
- they enter your email at btc-e "lost password" and probably a thousand other interesting sites
- they reset your password, then see that you also need 2FA
- they write an email to btc-e, telling them to disable it

Like I said, it's the promise "you can't lose, only (possibly) win". What you're marketing is a zero risk investment based on a high risk asset, and sorry, but that just sounds too good to be true.

[Your transaction]( is huge (over 45 KB in size) and pays a very low fee of 0.00000047 btc.
The reference client demands a fee of 0.0001 currently **per KB**, that means for the tx to be accepted by miners who follow the standard rules (by far most, I suppose), you'd have to have a fee included of 0.0046 btc.
You might get lucky and have it included by some miner that doesn't follow the rules, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Every proper client should have asked you to pay the right fee. What client did you use?
And before someone thinks that the fee is too much - again, the transaction this guy tries to send is over 45 KB in size, that's almost 1/20th of the total amount that is allowed in a whole block. It's supposed to be expensive to make such big transactions, because they are very uneconomical.

If security/difficulty is low on the chain that people use, that means it's easy to mine, that means it's easy to make money. And because of that, it wouldn't stay insecure for long.

Colored coins is a concept that makes it possible to create assets etc, and have the transaction of these assets happen on the bitcoin blockchain.
Check out [coinprism.com]( they offer an implementation of the concept.
That means that I can create an asset, like [my gold]( and if you give me a bitcoin address (any regular bitcoin address), I can send some to you. How important or valuable such a token is, of course depends on the trust and importance you put into the issuer.
It's important to understand though that a colored coin doesn't mean that 1 colored coin is equal to 1 bitcoin, or 1 cc = 0.000001 btc or something like that. There's no such relation. I can create 10 million of some asset and spend only 600 satoshi to create it. Then I send you 100k and again, spend 600 satoshi on the transaction. So you see, there's not really a direct correlation between the number of bitcoins and the number of colored coins. The Bitcoin network is just what is used for the transfer.

Thing is, this doesn't actually compare. You don't say you own 1 gold but you say you own 1 btc.
"Bitcoins" as a unit are actually chosen quite stupidly, imo. It would be a lot better if we weren't talking in Bitcoins, but in "grams" of bitcoin or "kilos" of bitcoin. Or any made-up name for the unit. "I own 23 squigglybuffs of bitcoin", whatever.

Not surprising. It's the same here in Germany, basically. And handling Bitcoin like gold makes a whole lot more sense than trying to handle it like a foreign currency. 
Bitcoin basically is nothing else but "digital gold". It was obviously designed to behave similar to gold. If people choose to use it for exchange of goods (as currency) is one thing, but there's little to no reason why it should have a special treatment compared to gold.

So about 2 weeks worth of freshly mined coins. Phew! How many millions have miners "taken in" over the year already to avoid selling? And how have they taken that money in? People gave it to them out of kindness?
Also, even "the two main mining operations" (whichever you mean by that) are just a small part of the overall mining ecosystem. Many miners *do* sell, and even if they temporarily refuse to do so, that doesn't change much. The coins are *out there* - that means they will eventually affect the price.

That is correct for all SEPA transfers too, afaik. *But* that only counts one day after it is booked. So when you send money in the evening, let's say 9 P.M, it is only booked the next day, so only has to arrive one day after that.
And no, that doesn't mean Bitcoin is "kind of useless", for countless other reasons that I'm sure you have heard enough of by now. Even one day, if it actually were one day, is a ridiculous amount of time for a simple change of a database entry, *especially* when it's done with centralized authorization. Bitcoin accomplishing the same in 10 minutes, *and* decentralized, is still a big deal, in the UK too.

There's exactly one solution that would work: just shut off their damn pool and thus force miners to join other pools. They wouldn't lose any income since they don't take any fees anyway. And they would still hold a *very* sizeable chunk of the mining share with their own hardware via cex.io.
They would still hold something like 15% of the network, but wouldn't just stuff a gigantic mining pool on top of it, off which they don't even earn anything.
There's a high chance that all they're doing right now ("working on mining decentralization solution") is trying to **hide** or redirect their hash power, which **doesn't do anything** to solve the issue.

The first three paragraphs of your post are adequately answered with "I don't care". Like I said, I don't measure user adoption by how many merchants accept it, how many people shop at those merchants or transaction volume. 
You anti-bitcoin folk always want to superimpose the need for heavy transaction usage on Bitcoin, because "how else is gonna be currency deh heh meeeh?!" 
Bitcoin is not a currency first, it's a technology, which has as one of many possible aspects, the use as currency. It has much more in common with gold than it has with paper money. Do you see lots of people claiming that gold isn't successful because nobody pays with it for their shoes?
The only important aspect here is how many new people join in on the *idea* of Bitcoin. As long as that continues, the rest will follow. I don't buy from overstock just because they take btc. That's just forcing something that doesn't need to be there. I'll buy from the store where I always buy whatever I buy, *when* they finally take btc. And until then, it's just a matter of convincing people of the idea and promises of bitcoin.


Common sense and reading their posts, pretty much. I assume few people who are bitcoiners are suddenly not bitcoiners anymore, and I can *see* new bitcoiners coming in, so... increase.

That makes only sense though if the fingerprint (ninki-phrase) is handed over a trusted channel, like in physical form, right?
Otherwise, the hypothetical someone who tampered with the PGP pubkey you received could just as easily tamper with the Ninki phrase.
Also, shouldn't the pubkey exchange be pretty safe anyway since it's HTTPS to and from your server? I'm really asking, absolutely no expert on these things.
The reason I'm wondering is that I think it would be **much** easier to use for new users if this sort of manual handshake wasn't necessary. The average Joe coming from facebook will definitely raise an eyebrow when getting to this step. "Now I have to give everyone I add to my friendlist this bunch of words? Wtf?"
I kinda think there should be a way for the user to click "Yes, I trust this without validating the contact's ninki phrase". With a little warning message like "never send any serious money to an unvalidated contact, if you don't know what you're doing blabla".

Yeah, all this shows is that you haven't understood the fallacy at all. OK, so here we go, counter set to thousand-and-one.


No, it was a bad decision because it cost you money, not earned you anything.
What you are doing is calculating in your profit from your **investment in Bitcoin** into your **investment in a miner**. It doesn't work that way. **Bitcoin** was profitable, not your **miner**. 
When you are thinking about whether to buy a miner or not, you have already made the decision that you want to invest in Bitcoin. Your miner gives you Bitcoin, nothing else. You already hope that Bitcoin will increase or at least hold its value. What you are looking at is whether it's a good decision to buy a miner, or just buy Bitcoin. And if you get more Bitcoins by just buying them outright instead of mining them, then it's a bad decision to buy the miner, and then the miner is **not** profitable.
Just to be clear: I'm not trying to bash you here. At the time when they made the offer, it *looked* like it would be actually profitable, so you're not to blame for taking it. But in hindsight, through the fact that they turned out to be a huge friggin' scam, it was not a profitable offer, and everybody would have been better off by not taking it and just buying bitcoin directly.

Yeah, or that you are able to sell the hash power for more, that's the speculation. If you look at the graph on the page, you'll see that the value of GH has actually gone **up** in the past days, even though logic would dictate that over time, it should only go down (and over longer periods of time, it will). 
So there's profit *potential*, as long as you find people who'll take the hash power from you for more than: [what you mined + what you paid].
The value going up recently is probably mostly due to the hype and discussion around GHash.io in the past days, and I would strongly advise against buying it. 1 GH is currently valued at ~0.0074 there. 1 GH will actually mine you [around 0.00130202 per month]( which is falling sharply with difficulty increases. A good rule of thumb when purchasing mining hardware is that you should be in the net positive within 3-4 months.

No, not necessarily. 
OP said in his original post that he was afraid of an attack, which would cost more than a year of pool revenue. So, even disregarding any costs the pool has, you'd need to run it problem-free for over a year, to make it a financially better option than just stealing users' money. 
Then compare the risk and work necessary of running for over a year to, say, buying a pool for 100 BTC and immediately being able to steals thousands of BTC from users with the click of a button.

There is no other reliable method. Nobody is really able to count bitcoiners. But, again... common sense.


No surveys show this. All that surveys show is that a lot of people don't even know *anything* about bitcoin yet, which completely contradicts any silly statements like "everyone who will buy into bitcoin already has".

Basically you have to trust that the algorithm that created it works (which it does, if you use a common source like bitadress.org...).
Good practice is to create a bunch of keys at once. Print 10 keys on a paper wallet out at once. Then try the whole process of sending money and retrieving it back on the first key with a small amount. If everything works fine on the first, you can be 99.999% sure that it'll work on all the others too.

Indeed it is. Which means Apple is perfectly *allowed* to make the business decision that they do. I think nobody here is saying somebody should force them to accept what we want them to accept. But that does in no way mean that we can't *not like* what their decisions are. 
While it's perfectly fine and within their freedom (that we so much want to preserve) to do whatever the hell they want, it's within our freedom to be outraged about their decisions, especially since their decisions limit the personal freedom of every one of their customers.

The 21 million is just the upper bound. It's the limit that will "never be reached" when you have BTC creation as it is.
Think about it, or use a calculator. If you have a function that halves its output after every X time, you create half the maximum output of the function in every X time slot, but *never reach* that maximum output.
So with 50 BTC output every block, and the block reward halving every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), you create half of the maximum output (10.5 million BTC) in the first 210,000 blocks. Then in the next 210,000 blocks, you create half of the remaining BTC (5.25 million BTC), then half of the remaining (2,625 million BTC) etc, etc. The upper limit is 21 million BTC, but you never reach them.
When people say that 2140 is the year where BTC production comes to a halt, they say that not because 21 million is then reached. It is very close to that number then, but not quite there. This is just the year where another block halving wouldn't be possible anymore, at least not with the current implementation of Bitcoin. Until the end of 2140, every block would produce a reward of 0.00000001 Bitcoin (a *satoshi*), the smallest unit we have. Another halving with the current implementation would thus not work and every following block will only produce a reward of 0 BTC. But it's possible that, if we ever come so far, would just change the implementation to allow for even smaller amounts to be produced, allowing BTC production (albeit tiny) to continue forever.

Definitely agree with that. The worst thing is: it will continue. They open their doors again (well, the btc side anyway, nevermind the infinitely deep fiat hole), and it will go on. People will keep trading there because they're greedy.
But I don't agree that all fees now are voluntary gifts. People selling in panic was likely the result of doubts about Gox's solvency, and people wanting to be rather in fiat than in BTC in that case (legal reasons etc). It's the reaction to the fear that Gox might be over for good. And what we have now is the *bizarre* situation that this company actually makes a shitton of money off people *doubting their solvency*. That's just insane.

OK, you got a lot of answers here, of which most completely ignore your request that the funds shouldn't be accessible even by yourself.
The *only* method that can do that, as far as I know, is using nlocktime, which someone also suggested. But I wouldn't recommend that. Doing that assumes that the whole transaction handling, signing etc will be exactly the same in 20 years, which is not guaranteed. It's not even likely.
Why is it important to you that you yourself can't access the money? Do you think someone will try to force you to release it? If that issue is not *that* important to you, just go with the paper/electrum-seed methods suggested. But familiarize yourself with it, try the whole process out a few times with low amounts etc, to be sure you know what you're doing.
Having said that, I think the idea of putting all your money into Bitcoin and just letting it sit for 20 years is nothing else but fucking insane. You could be super duper rich when you come out of prison, but seriously, man, the chances are a lot higher that you will have nothing left at all.

Since it's "die Karte", it's also "die Mastercard". You wouldn't usually call the company this way though, only when you mean the actual physical card.
In German legalese, companies (as juridical persons) are also always female (so "die"). But in common speach, nobody does that, usually companies don't have an article at all, nobody would say "der Apple", like you wouldn't say "the Apple" - it's just "Apple".

First, 3x redundancy is probably not nearly enough if you just pay random people to play server. Especially considering that the data can be 3x at the same person who just put up 10000 virtual nodes on his one computer to fuck with the system.
Second, whether the price will be lower than centralized options - I believe it when I see it, my intuition tells me that's complete bullshit.
And finally, if it's not cheaper, there is absolutely no reason for this to exist in the first place. Not everything has to be decentralized. Centralized, encrypted storage is completely OK in my book.

People make that mistake way too much here. And it's an important distinction, because when actual supply gets cut in half, you could assume that price has to increase. If supply *growth* gets cut in half, you can make no such assumption.

Given these preconditions, anonymity is impossible and mixing doesn't make much sense.
When 500 coins disappear from an address that everyone knows is yours, and appear on an address that everyone knows is your friend, then it really doesn't matter what happens in between (mixing), "everyone" just needs a little bit of common sense to put 1+1 together.
Instead of using address B ("that everyone knows belongs to my friend"), you'd use a new address C where that is not the case. Or better, split it up over addresses [D-X] so it's harder to guess where your 500 coins are in the end.

I'm not "bitching" about it, I just understand that this stuff isn't really free. Just like with a free app, the users pay it at the end, if only by being exposed to advertising.
Banks don't make it with "other activities", what does that even mean... ? To make money, they use your money. And your reward in form of interest could be bigger if there would be no insurance cases that they had to pay. It's as simple as that. 
I'm not even judging that model. But thinking that insurance just comes for free and they make *that* money some other magical way is pure delusion. 
You seem to think that because your bank gives you money on the surface, that their services and insurance don't cost you. That's like working for $1 per hour and justifying it with "Well, I get payed, don't I?!?"

The (by far) biggest part of their hashrate is not their own hardware, but people mining on their 0%-fee pool (which I'm convinced they are only running to hide ponzi-like shenanigans they do with their "cloud-hashing" operation).

No, it's not a flaw in and on itself, it's the way it always was and everybody who knows about the basics of bitcoin knows that. The system is designed to work well as long as it's safe that no one single person or group controls more than 50% of the network. It's a system that builds consensus by majority. If the majority is a liar, the system has no choice but to believe the lie. That is the big premise of Bitcoin: The majority needs to be honest.
And keep in mind, it's still true now that not a single person or group has direct control over the hashing power. It's not like any one miner, or even a handful of them has over 50%. The bitcoin network is now big enough that it would cost billions to get to that point that you alone control that much. What we have now is just that many miners mine on the same pool, effectively making the pool owner the person that sits in the bottleneck, where he could *theoretically* misdirect the hashing power of his people to double spend.
If he were to abuse it though, and double spending would be detected, it's pretty much a safe bet that people would immediately jump ship there, making it a one-time thing. It would still be very ugly so we should really better not let it come this far.
But I'm confident that people will expand on decentralized pool systems like P2Pool. Those can work just fine. They still have flaws that need to be straightened out, but I see a future where people only mine this way.

The current debt my nation has, I did nothing to cause it. But I'm the one paying for it. Or, more likely, I'll only pay my part of the interest and stack more debt on top of it, so that my children are born into a similar, but slightly worse situation.


That's the thing: you don't need financial policy if you have sound money. When there's no one that can debase the currency uncontrollably, you don't need to control him.
And how has society a say in the governance of its financial policy now? Bankers are not politicians, they don't get elected. Even from the idealistic view that "the state = the people", that doesn't apply here.


Yeah, and kings were too. Putting humans in charge of something like this will always lead to corruption. And not only are people and institutions flawed, they are also not omniscient, far from it. Even if they mean well, their silly efforts of predicting the world economy and influencing it with little interest-rate shifts are just futile.


Aside from what I've pointed at before, there's really so much issues with it, I don't even know where to begin. There's just something obviously wrong about the idea that if I save money for retirement now, that it will have lost at least half its value by the time I get to spend it. I can't for the life of me understand how anyone can convince themselves that that's right. It's a giant scam, and there are institutions directly profiting from it, namely the central banks in cooperation with the states.

It was a way to "pay" for receiving a new altcoin with a fixed supply without giving the money to the coin's developer. So for example, the developer says "we're distributing 10m coins after date x, and everyone gets the amount proportionally to how many btc were 'burned'". This is done so there's no classic IPO where the people pay the developer directly to buy in, which is usually a strong indicator of a scam. A proof of burn is usually considered much more fair. 
In most cases, it's still bullshit if you ask me, and everyone buying in only looks to sell right after launch for 10x the price. Sadly, that often even works.

The average person wouldn't need to. Banks would lend, with their money, not their customer's. Also, nothing speaks against customers deliberately [time-locking their deposits]( and have that money used by the bank with zero reserve (in return for interest payment).
Yes, full reserve definitely would reduce the amount of money to be lent, possibly a lot. But that's not just a bad thing. The money lent would actually be the money of banks, and if they failed to have proper business practices and all their loans would default, the bank would be broke, but no customer would be hurt, hence no bailouts required etc, etc. It would be a much more healthy and stable system.


From a financial, profit oriented perspective, it **is** stupid for a bank to do full reserve, if they have the alternative of using fractional reserve. Of course. That doesn't make it morally right, or a proper system. The reason these banks do it is because of greed, not because it "wouldn't work otherwise".

I have explained in the very post that you replied to, how that is complete nonsense. If you disagree, at least give some sort of reason. But there really isn't much to disagree, if you think banks only make money through fractional reserve, you're just wrong. 
Banks have **own** capital like every other business. They can work with that without relying on customer's money.

You know... I was aware Gox was shit. I was preaching it here for the last year to people who kept quoting Gox prices and using them, supporting them etc. I hadn't used them at all since they stopped fiat withdrawals. 
But when the whole allegedly malleability-connected problems started, and Gox prices went to 1/5th of the regular price, I got greedy. 
When I see 1/5th of the regular price, I see the market saying "There's an 80% chance the btc will never get out." I thought that was *way* exaggerated and worth the gamble. I have observed Gox doing shit and being incompetent for years, but I really didn't expect them to be insolvent - or outright fraudsters, as it seems to be the case now.
So I send money there, and now I could kick myself for being so greedy. Lost about $2k, which is still peanuts compared to what others have lost, but it's more than I should have risked here.

The way the blockchain works is that its current block is a confirmation of everything that happened in the past. It's a chain where every piece builds upon the last piece. Take a piece out, the chain breaks. So if you want to change something in the past, you need to rewrite the entire history after that.
If we want to change a bitcoin block from 2012 (to change a transaction in that), it's not enough if we "all agree to that". Every single transaction after that block would be invalid, like the entire history was wiped out. That's why this would clearly **never** happen.

I can't imagine this is really the legal and right way for them to handle this. Someone at your bank must have fucked up. Maybe the teller thought the depositor looked like a nice guy.
Oh and when you're dealing with your bank, don't mention what the deposit was buying. Because it *absolutely doesn't matter*. And when they hear you say the word "Bitcoin", you can bet your ass they'll stop listening to you right away and will possibly, on top of having screwed you out of your money, cancel your bank account, because you are now "high risk" (even though that's actually them). Just say you gave away the product you were selling after confirmed receipt of the money in your account. That's really all they need to know, if they ask you to tell them what, just tell them nicely that it doesn't concern them.

To create a single fair currency that can be used on the entire world, amongst other reasons.
There can be stuff like banks and PayPal in a bitcoin economy (and there will be, though many people here seem to disagree with that), the important part is the underlying asset is global, unrestricted and not controlled by anyone.

It's your personal choice to roll with that strategy. But I strongly suspect that even if the price were ever to fall that low again, you still wouldn't buy. If it were to happen, it would be for reasons that would have you say that the utility value is now at $5 or something.
The reason most people buy bitcoin (if they're not looking to immediately spend them again) is because they believe that bitcoin has a big future, aka speculation. If you don't believe in that, your personal valuation of it will just always be lower than the market price.

That would be quite abusable and not bring much of an effect. There's a bunch of nodes (like blockchain.info's) that would get a huge advantage in this, even though they're not necessarily more useful to the network than anyone else. Also, and more importantly, it simply wouldn't work because anyone can be a node, and everyone sending a transaction could just send it to themselves to relay and save the fee.
Also, do you mean only literally the first node gets payed that you send the tx to? Or a certain number of first node**s**? If the second, that would just mean every node that gets a tx would bounce it back and force between itself until there's no reward left.
Incentivizing nodes would be a very important step for Bitcoin imo, but until now I haven't seen any concept that does it adequatly. The big problem is that solutions can easily be abused by Sybil attacks (pretending like you're a thousand nodes for example).

That's the *new* business model of banks.
Originally, you would pay a bank to hold and secure your money. *All of it.* And it was good.
And in a full reserve system, banks can of course still make money by lending money (and charging interest), just that they have to use **their** pool of money to do that. And banks offer a lot of other services where they can charge people. It's really not like the poor banks would have no way of earning money if they weren't running a fractional reserve...
What people opposing fractional reserve need to realise though is that if banks don't run a fractional reserve, they have absolutely no reason to pay you interest. And not just that, they'd have no reason to hold your money at all, if you don't also pay them a fee for holding it for you.
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:32:01
I don't think he's missing something, as far as I can tell he's exactly right: You're using a 2 of 4 multisig setup, where 2 of 4 keys are already on a netbook and you have 1 key each in seperate locations. 
What exactly does this do better than just having a normal bitcoin private key on the netbook, printing out the key, cutting it in half and putting the two halves in seperate locations? 
What *would* actually get you a security benefit is printing out two copies of the key in BIP38 and putting those in the two locations: then even if the two locations are compromised, your key is safe, plus you'd only need to rely on one of the locations if you'd ever need the backup.

"Fully functional" just like a person missing a leg and having down syndrome is.
For the question of doing analysis: it's very likely that they didn't lose much of anything. Their withdrawal requests needed to be re-sent manually and it must have become apparent *very* quickly that there was a problem, which led them to stop the withdrawals. So even without doing in-depth blockchain analysis, I'm pretty sure when I say that they lost close to zero, if they're not hiding something else (which is entirely possible).
On the other hand, they raked in huge profits in fees due to the fear-trading. So what you should be looking at is how much money they actually **made** off this.

"100% proof of stake" is no revolutionary new invention like they're trying to sell it. There is a **reason** that peercoin and similar earlier approaches didn't do that. You need to have some kind of fair initial distribution, otherwise the whole thing is nothing but a scam.

The only thing I learned here is that there's yet another clueless wannabe trying to lecture me in the most condescending way.


No, that's not at all what I am like and that statement doesn't make any sense here.


No, that is literally not how it works, no matter how hard you think otherwise. A captain of industry like yourself should know that. You're like those people on Craigslist who don't find a seller and conclude that the price must be infinite. Since there is obviously no supply but demand that means the price is infinite, right? Or is it zero then too? Hummmmm that logic is just too hard for me. But I'm just 6 years old and you're like 50 and all experienced and shit, so what do I know.

So what inflation is doing is "accounting for population growth", uhuh. 
Deflationary currencies "account for population growth" by *being deflationary*. It's one of the reasons they are deflationary - no increase in supply, increase in demand =&gt; deflation.


So if we stopped printing money now, nobody would pay younger people for their work anymore, we'd just sit on our deflationary money that is worth infinity sugar cubes and rub our dicks all day long about how we can exploit the youth (..how exactly again?).


Worked for thousands of years. It has downsides, sure. But the reason we don't have them anymore has nothing to with "being smarter now". It has instead a lot to do with the U.S. completely fucking everything up in the early 20th century and inventing and pushing a system that is effectively nothing but a huge global scam.

Sure it does. It makes no difference to the fresh coins whether they're immediately sold or not.
That's like saying you can't dig for gold if you intend to just sell the gold afterwards. Rest assured that's exactly what gold miners do.


Yeah and I assume you're one private person mining a bit. You can afford to just hold on to the coins. What you're effectively doing is converting fiat in the form of electricity cost into bitcoins, on whose value you then speculate.
The people who mine most of the coins today though have pretty huge operations, speculating on bitcoins is not their business. They need to convert a lot of it to fiat.

You're EU, right?


Kraken or Bitstamp, if you want real exchanges. Be prepared that you need to do verification (with ID etc) for them.
If you're not looking to trade, but just want to buy some coin for some other purpose (like buying drugs..), you can try something like [Anycoin Direct]( Haven't tried them myself yet, but I've heard good things.


To speak generally, they are stored "in the Bitcoin network". It's important to understand that you don't have Bitcoins "on your computer" or something like that, what you have instead is a "key" to access an address and move the Bitcoins *on the network*. And like with any key, you can make copies of the key and have it in many places, but every copy will give access to the same address.


If you use reliable exchanges or services like the mentioned above, you should be fine. Otherwise, as with all things in life, apply some common sense.


You've probably heard about the Silk Road. Get Tor, learn to use it, do some research and if you have more questions -&gt; I have no experience with that so I can't really help you there.
And if you want unrelated, but good advice: don't smoke too much pot. Drugs are meant to be tried out and experienced, not to dominate your everyday life.

This has nothing to do with using blockchain.info. It depends on the transaction you're doing. If it's low priority (lower priority than 57,600,000), then you are required to pay the minimum fee.

This is absolutely important and the reason why PoS is a no-go for me. If you can't reach consensus, you have a crypto that doesn't work.
Right now it seems to work fine for PPC and the like (Blackcoin, lol), since everyone plays by the rules. But thinking it through and assuming rational, profit-oriented miners, it would result in some battle-of-the-orphans, where you couldn't *ever* rely on any transaction being confirmed for good.
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:02:47




As long as they don't take proper steps to leave their wealth, it can be lost, yes.


No. First of all, keep in mind that bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so it doesn't matter in theory if we are at one point only left with 1 bitcoin. That 1 bitcoin will be chopped in as many pieces as are needed. 
It is to be expected that the amount of coins that leave circulation through lost coins won't be too big. What it will do is have a slow deflationary impact on the currency, that should lead in a slow increase in value over time.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:56:11
Yes. If half the mining disappeared, it would then take double the time - roughly 4 weeks.
This is actually a bit of a weakness. Say mining would be at an equilibrium (barely profitable in regards to electricity cost), and then bitcoin price would drop by a factor of 100 (for whatever reason), a possible consequence could be that so many miners drop out that it would take a long, long time (years) for the next 2016 blocks to be built. On top of that, the difficulty can only rise or fall by 400% as a fixed maximum. So even if the next difficulty setting finally came, it would only reduce the difficulty to 1/4th, which would still be much too high for a 100x smaller bitcoin price.
Anyway, in such a scenario, there would probably be enough consensus to do a hard fork and artificially set the difficulty lower. So it's not really much of a problem.

Really, don't worry too much. It's not that hard, and becomes easy rather quickly. After a while, everything is just common sense to you. Just keep in mind that only you are ever to see that private key and that you should not throw it away unless you want to abandon the address. 
Follow the advice from and make a blockchain.info wallet. You can there import your private key and the rest will be pretty much self-explanatory. Good luck!

The R value is part of ECDSA signatures in Bitcoin. The client you use has to use a unique R value every time you send from an address.
If you send from a bitcoin address multiple transactions, and reuse the value for R multiple times, anyone can calculate the private key for that address - and steal everything that is left on that address. [Here's how.](
Faulty clients had these problems in the past. For example, the Java random number generator used by Android turned out to be broken in 2013, which was uncovered through Bitcoin, because an Android Bitcoin client had reused R values, which would have been impossible if the random numbers were truly random. 
Recently, blockchain.info made press with getting user's money stolen (and then returned) due to reused R values, I think it's still on the frontpage.

Generating vanity addresses is basically simple brute force, you try and try and try until you generate an address that looks correct.
For just making a short vanity address, it's best to do this yourself and not by other people. Just download [bitcoinvanitygen]( and use the oclvanitygen program (uses your gpu for generation, which is much faster).
But yes, you don't have to trust sites that generate vanity addresses for you. Crypto-magic allows them to generate a part-private-key from your part-public-key that you combine with another part-private-key that only you know so that they don't know your actual complete private key.
How this works in detail I cannot explain to you either. Here's an explanation from the help page of [an online vanitygen](








@_date: 2014-02-11 15:07:26
Just guessing basically, but if they didn't take all and the money was on different addresses (with the 0.2 on one address), it's probably the case that nothing about your blockchain account was hacked, but instead the private key of that address got leaked somewhere else.
Did you import that key into your account manually (from a paper wallet for example)?
edit: I misunderstood the part about them "not taking all". Apparently they instead deposited money into your account? Which is even weirder.
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:32:28
You're not lowering the power a pool has, because you're only declining your own hashrate, which the pool wouldn't have anyway if you'd just mine for someone else. Not only that, if you're mining for a different pool, you actually work towards a better balance of the pools. While this here instead does nothing at all.
All this "attack" accomplishes is that you're stealing from the pool (= from the other people mining for the pool), while just pointlessly declining to contribute.

So by not giving my money to the poor, I'm *killing* them? 
So when someone exchanges his Bitcoin for Litecoin, you say he's killing people too, because he could have exchanged the money for food and given it to people in need? Or if he just owns any money *at all*? Geez, we're all murderers!
What you don't understand is that this "burning" of BTC is not like throwing cash in a fire. It's a conversion. You're turning your BTC into another currency, just like you exchange it for any altcoin. The value doesn't get destroyed, it just moves from the BTC into the XCP.

They'd cost website's visitors a million in electricity just to make a single dollar for themselves. It's absolutely amazing to me that they were serious about doing this.
Even if they planned to ask people for permission before mining in their browser, it should read in big, bold letters: "Do you agree to pay about $1 (amount irrelevant) in electricity for using this site? Mind though that we only receive less than $0.001 of that. The other 99.9% of your money gets blown out the back of your computer and is gone forever like a fart in the wind."

I'm trying to make the connection to Paypal to show you that it's exactly the same and that *this has nothing to do with Bitcoin*.
When I pay you for a porn subscription via Paypal with my CC. A hundred dollars. And then you take the money out of Paypal. And then I do a chargeback. What do you think Paypal will do?

All your arguments apply there the same way and are pointless the same way. 
You imply some elaborate identity fraud by the merchant when this makes absolutely no point here, since absolutely the same would apply in the conventional system.
Yes, there can be credit card fraud. But there is absolutely no reason to assume that the gateway would be retarded enough to just be left sitting on the chargeback risk. The gateway has to make sure he knows the identity of the accepting party, but **that has always been the case**.

Maybe after the next one, maybe the one after that. But it'll happen, and it will be very interesting to see the network, the market and people react to it.
And I don't mean it's bad this will happen. It's necessary. [There's a soft limit to how much "security" we actually need in the bitcoin network]( and things like this tend to shoot way over target.

One thing you might have overlooked related to this: MtGox didn't use to send emails when accounts were accessed. But they announced this in their [recent statement]( (in hindsight, like they like to do stuff):

If you think a step further, this probably means that the accounts that got the email now were probably hacked a looong time ago, and are just now finding out due to this bug. It's probably some bot that logs in frequently into hacked accounts and checks whether they have a bitcoin balance that it could steal.

In this case, it's more like having a bright yellow painted 1/50th of a penny, knowing that it's worth $500 and still spending it.
The whole idea of importing paper wallets with colored coins and mistakenly uncoloring them falls short when you think that what you'd import is a measely 0.000006 BTC, regardless of whether you're importing 1 share of something or 10000 (that's by how OpenAssets works).
Is it *theoretically* possible that someone still does that mistake? Yeah, sure. But I'd say that chance is about a hundred times smaller than the chance of just losing your paper wallet/backups.
The most important thing though is that in the endgame I'd expect, you wouldn't need a different client to see that your coins are colored. These are easy protocols, once one is showing success, regular Bitcoin clients will learn to recognize it. While maybe not allowing you to take full use of the colored coins (own client for that), they could definitely warn the occasional idiot who's trying to uncolor his coins.

No, it denies the State the power to control money. A power that even by the pseudo bullshit system currently in place, it shouldn't have. "Independent" central banks are supposed to be in charge of that. Except that simply doesn't work. Everyone with half a brain understands they are not independent, and they can't be.

Why? Even on a minimal fractional reserve they'd make enough money to balance the tiny cost it takes to maintain your account.


Well, that's expensive because they physically hold and secure *stuff* there. I don't need them to physically hold paper for me, just as they don't really move around paper now. All they need to provide is the database entry of my account and leave it be. The cost for that would be absolutely minimal; i'd actually assume they'd do it for free, in the hopes that you take your other financial activities (which involve fees) to the same bank.

You are not increasing the money supply, you are increasing divisibility. It's not changing anything about the limited supply. 
You're saying "why cut this gold bar into smaller pieces, you can just as well have more gold bars". That doesn't make any sense. When I cut my gold bar into smaller pieces, I don't suddenly have more gold.


No we don't. This is a non-problem that is easily manageable if need arises. For now, it's very much divisible enough as it is.
For this to even become an issue, btc price would need to approach $1 million. Before that can happen, a lot of other, harder problems have to be solved.

The amounts of gold or other metals created by these processes is absolutely *minimal*. If you use enough energy to sustain a whole city for a week, you have still not created enough gold that you could even see it with the naked eye (pulled that right out of my ass, but pretty sure it's accurate enough). 
So no, this is no argument against gold. Creating it like this wouldn't be economically viable unless gold was worth a million times more than what it is today.
A much more realistic argument against gold is that it's always possible that huge amounts of gold are found, be it here on earth, or when asteroid mining becomes a thing. This planet alone is gigantic and we're only scratching a bit on the surface so far.

Exclude all other miners by orphaning their blocks, get all (100%) block rewards and a mining monopoly. Seems like kind of a problem to me.


First of all, they own *a lot* of hardware themselves. My main concern is with someone getting over 50% in *own* hardware. But even with a pool, the incentive for miners to stay with them is there. When they get 100% of block rewards, and other pools are getting none, people would have to leave the pool for zero profit, or stay with them and get everything. And unless enough people leave to push them back down enough to end the monopoly, it wouldn't end.

Yes, it does. 


The point is not that the newcomers can mine cheaper than they could buy, that is obviously not the case. The point is that through the process of mining, there is a continuing source of bitcoin that gets distributed. And that is exactly what is happening. And that is exactly what is keeping the price low. But that is working as intended, because in the long term, it is much more important to have a proper distribution than to have a fast, unjustified boost to astronomical prices.


Again, this is just completely misunderstanding the whole concept. Miners are putting in effort and energy to mine these coins, that's partly what gives them value.
I don't know what kind of fucked up centralized weirdness you're imagining where we would give newly minted bitcoin to organizations promoting Bitcoin. What kind of a system is that supposed to be, where newly minted currency goes to an organization that just promotes itself? Ffs, that's worse than central banking.

I was just [thinking about that]( yesterday.
Don't you think it could be possible to have P2Pool handle this automatically, so that it - for example - splits the total miners up into X pools @ 100/X% of the network? That way, you don't have the problem with centralized pools and their possibly evil pool operators, but you also avoid huge coinbase transactions that fill entire blocks.
Also, how did you get to the conclusion that the "ideal" ecosystem is about 8 pools at 10% each? Why not 23 at 3.6%?
And I agree, OP is a moron.

No, it's just more likely that you **did** get phished without realising, i.e. you enter blockchain.info in your browser, but you don't actually get blockchain.info over TOR, just something that looks like it. That's what SSL is for and the reason you should always make sure you use " and check that the SSL certificate is alright. Usually regular browsers give you big fat warnings if the certificate is self-signed, but it's possible that if you just entered "blockchain.info" in your browser, that you never went over an SSL connection.

It moves when there is an imbalance of supply and demand. But as I've said before, the bitcoin supply isn't affected by how many people are mining. There are 3600 coins created every day either way. 
And what bills miners have to pay is irrelevant too. What do I as a bitcoin buyer care what bills a miner has to pay? That doesn't magically increase demand. And if you're saying that miners will just stop selling their coins (therefore artificially decreasing supply), then, like I've said before, they are just acting irrationally. If they are mining at a loss, the only financially reasonable thing to do is turn of their miner.

What I meant (I don't gamble) and where the issue with trust only really arises is when you **invest** on these sites. Because there is no safety in place to prevent a) the owner just running with all the invested money and b) the owner gambling himself on the site (knowing how the rolls turn out).

Estimating the difficulty increase to continue in this manner is unreasonable imo. I think mining is already getting unprofitable for some, a few more difficulty adjustments without a drastic price increase and miners will start to drop out in drones, *if* they act rationally. I know many of them don't (they're the same guys that think their BFL miner was profitable, because Bitcoin increased in value 50x).
So I think the halving might actually adjust a bit further away again.

Exactly. And not just if Bitcoin drops. Even if Bitcoin stays roughly the same over a time in median, they have to pay to all the people whose contracts expired while btc was on the downside, and get nothing of the profit of the rest. They get nothing if Bitcoin doesn't rise more than 10% in price in the given timeframe (or 15%, I don't remember).
Of course, if Bitcoin goes through another 1000% growth stage, they can make a lot.
But all in all, their business model is "Bitcoin will grow a lot", not much else. Granted, if their business gets a lot of new money into Bitcoin, they could help fulfill that prophecy themselves and be the motor that drives adoption. But still, I think their business model is dangerous and very risky.

It depends from where you look whether the transaction "happened". As far as the blockchain as the eternal datastructure is concerned, a transaction only happened when it's in a block. What the mempool contains is irrelevant. In fact, the individual mempool can contain crap that never gets confirmed, happens all the time.
When you have a transaction that was in a valid block, thus considered confirmed, and then that transaction is not in a valid block anymore, I would call that reversed. It gets reversed *and* then delayed.

The "user" of the bitcoin network in this case is the faulty programmed client. Maybe wrong to call it "user error", but the issue is the same. It's not an error of Bitcoin, it's an error in the use of bitcoin.

This matches my observations exactly. I work in a company full of (more or less) smart IT people. Most that I've talked to about it have heard about its existence, but not a single one has even a basic grasp of what it actually is.
There is still so much room to grow just with techy people, it's ridiculous. The only problem is that it's not easy to get people on board with radically different ideas, especially when it involves them throwing money at it. That's why Bitcoin's "get-rich-quick-in-this-new-bubble" thing is probably the way to go. Come for the riches, stay for the ideology (and the riches).

No, you check what the TREZOR is telling you. But what it says in the browser is incorrect right from the start, because the bad extension is making your browser tell you a scammer bitcoin address.

Miners are different in that they invest resources, and the system is designed so that their investment (electricity and infrastructure costs) matches the value of coins mined. 
Just running a node on the other hand is pretty cheap, and being in a centralized position where you get 1000x the rewards that other nodes get, but not having noticeably higher costs is... unfair. You wouldn't really be incentivizing nodes per se, you'd be incentivizing *first* nodes. Every node that gets a transaction as a 2nd or later relay could just say "nope, I don't get anything so I won't relay this". Not that they'd definitely do this, but I don't think incentivizing only the first node in a thousands of nodes long chain of nodes is really a good way to go.


You don't have to "run" a node for any considerable amount of time. You just make one up. The network has no way of knowing what's a real node and what not. When the transaction leaves your computer, you'd just act like it has actually moved between a lot more nodes. That's the Sybil problem I meant before.

That is not true. The PoS coins are **new** coins. If you have 20% and just sit on it, you'll still have 20% in a few years. You'll have more coins in total, but the same percentage of the entire supply, since everybody else's amount has grown by the same percentage.

It has nothing to do with Moore's Law, but with the basic principles of Bitcoin mining.

Apparently, I don't. You figured it out pretty well yourself. 
Yes, one is intentionally faciliating drug trade by building a website with that very specific purpose, and the other is the postal service, which gets abused by the first party to unknowingly faciliate drug trade. Not the same, not comparable, at all.


That's good.


The fact that you had such an easy time determining why I've said it's bullshit is because it's pretty obvious, and I knew that even you yourself must have known that it was a terrible comparison.


It kind of is. That's why they take measures to detect and prohibit these things. The problem they're facing is that they also have to respect secrecy of correspondence, so they are walking a line between respecting people's privacy and caring for people's security.
Would you rather have it that they open every package for your security? It doesn't go more police state than that.

I think this is very likely going to happen, fractional reserve has many positive effects (mostly for the banks, but also for the general economy). 
As others have pointed out already, the good thing is that with a system based on hard money like bitcoin, they couldn't just paper over it when (if) the fractional reserve breaks down.

There are more speculative investments, and less speculative investments, yet they're all investments. The word "speculative" just means that there is thought to be relatively high risk associated with the investment asset in question.

If you pay more for electricity than you get, it's a hobby that just costs you money for no reason. If you keep mining in that situation, maybe it makes some weird sense psychologically to you (seperating the coins that you buy &amp; mine), but it's definitely not rational.
Code yourself a little program that does nothing but run in an endless loop and periodically prints "Share accepted!" and tells you how much you *would have* mined, then just buy that amount. Basically the same thing and you save money...
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:46:12


I say nope. The rallye, even if it really started out fake, drew in a lot of new blood. So there was definitely a legitimate increase, but who knows by how much.

Well, gilding users doesn't disappear just because there's bitcoin tips. You could gild people with bitcoin with the press of a button, and for tips that are below the price of reddit gold, you'd give a normal bitcoin tip. With the money from tips sitting on their reddit account, I'd wager more people are inclined to use that money to buy gold anyway (or tip others gold with it).
Overall, I don't think it'd be a bad strategy by reddit to create a system where lots of funds are being moved on their site. There are plenty of possibilites to profit from that. If people have money sitting on your site, you're in the best position to sell something to them.

@_date: 2014-03-21 12:38:18
This is a problem, but it's definitely not one to be solved by regulation.
First of all, who would enforce it? The United States, World Police?
Second, it wouldn't do much. It's not a matter of how much a certain pool *appears* to have, it's how much it actually has. If someone was planning to attack bitcoin and get more hashrate, they would just not make it obvious what blocks are theirs. Or act like they're actually 2, or 3, or 4 pools.


No, they just shouldn't be able to, that's the basic premise of bitcoin. Not by some centralized power forcing them to stay small, but by their inability to become that big. And so far, that works well. It would likely cost billions of dollars to get 51% of the hashrate. Pools have a special place here because they combine all the mining power of other people. But since these other people have a free will, their ability to abuse this power is also quite limited. Once it became obvious a pool was acting badly, miners would leave. Still, it's a bad situation and they shouldn't get to have that power in the first place.
Decentralized mining like P2Pool is one solution to this, but has its own weaknesses.

You're forgetting the most important and most realistic reason, external forces: the U.S. Feds are stopping them. It already came out that they froze millions of Gox's funds in their Silk Road chase. These investigations have definitely not stopped and the feds have no problem spitting in Gox's and Bitcoin's soup if it helps them catch some drug dealers. 
When they got SR, they uncovered all the transactions related to it, since they are public on the blockchain, and it is very possible that they're now "following the money" around and that every outgoing transaction that is stopped on Gox is related to this.
Just a theory, but I find it quite plausible. It also explains their mysterious silence/bullshit excuses in all this. They're not allowed to talk about these ongoing investigations.

Going against the crowd here, but I don't believe this.
When heartbleed was introduced, I *knew* it wouldn't even take a day until all the media sing "NSA, NSA, NSA" in unison. The NSA denied knowing about it, but sure, it makes so much sense that they're responsible, right? (edit: I'm not saying that the NSA is necessarily speaking the truth, of course not. But jumping to the opposite conclusion "just because" is completely irrational.)
All this article is based on is:


Uhuh. Right. Who? And if he knew about this, why didn't *he* do something about it? Like make millions over millions by selling the exploit or using it himself? Because he was working for the NSA and couldn't tell? But now, suddenly, that's no problem anymore? Sure, and what a hero!
This all sounds like the typical MSM bullshit parade. NSA news sell very well, and this just fits too good. "Wouldn't it be some reaaaally hardcore stuff if the NSA knew about this all along?! Let's just tell everyone they did!"
Think. Is there the tinies shred of evidence for these claims around? *Anything* other than baseless speculations? Isn't it a little bit strange how fast this went down? Until now, they barely had enough time to make the whole story up, let alone do any actual research and find evidence that links the NSA to heartbleed.

This sort of definition makes a lot more sense than to just say "speculation is not investment because it's risky". Yet I still can't come to agree that the nature of the "cash flow" is all that important and makes for a truly meaningful separation of "investment" and "speculation".
What if I put money into a company that trades commodities? They expect a continuous cash flow through their business activity, yet that cash flow is ultimately dependent on the performance of certain commodities. Am I now investing or speculating?
To more or less degree, this is true for every business that uses any sort of physical resources. When investing in most industrial companies, aren't you indirectly speculating on oil price, copper price,...?
Going by your definition, I guess you could say there's speculation which is not investment, but there's hardly any investment that's not also speculation.

Now you're implying Bitpay or another payment processor (even if that's coinbase itself). 
Coinbase's auto-refill feature will just replace your outgoing bitcoin payments. Whether those go through some extra exchange process is another topic.
And using your example, you still need electricity (Bitcoin) to move the value (sound) to the other side. In the case of Bitpay and the like, where you exchange cash for bitcoins on one side, send bitcoins, then exchange them back to cash on the other side (maybe in a different currency), you use Bitcoin simply as the transaction system, which is fine too, though not the ultimate goal of a closed loop economy.

It is a problem because it hinders adoption by new people a lot. I would say there's about 200k bitcoiners worldwide at best, to which 2/3 of the entire future supply has already been distributed. What would you think, being one of the remaining billions of people who have never before heard about bitcoin? 
"Yeah that's the fair system we need, our salvation!"


[citation needed]. And don't tell me this is common sense, because you're wrong. Wealth doesn't distribute by default, it consolidates - the rich get richer. This has been the case with money since the dawn of time and there is absolutely no magic mechanism through which bitcoin changes that.

No, you got it backwards. [Inflation is an increase in the general price level.]( Increase in money supply *can be* one of the causes of inflation, but it *is* not inflation. 
People get confused about this all the time, because you can also say "inflation of the money supply". But if you're just talking about regular "inflation", that's **price**, and nothing else.


That doesn't mean it can't be measured. Measures like a CPI are definitely a subject of discussion, [but they are the way inflation is measured]( 
Just looking at the money supply side and making it out to be the root of everything is nonsense. People who do that (unfortunately there are plenty here) always forget the demand side in the situation. That's why there's fear of deflation even though there's money pumped into the system like crazy: if there's no demand for the fresh money, there's no inflation, no matter how much of it you pump into the system.

I don't think Karpeles was the "mastermind behind silk road", and he's **definitely** not DRP. But I've thought for a long time that Gox must've had some close relation to SR.
It was never a coincidence how the last bubble started right after SR got seized. At the time, people could shrug it off with "it's the media attention bitcoin is receiving due to SR", or even "now that the illegal business aspect is gone, everyone loves bitcoin!". 
But the truth is, Karpeles must have shat his pants like never before. Maybe a big part of Gox' coins disappeared because it actually got seized by the government. Seizures started half a year before that already, and when the withdrawal problems began, Karpeles dropped statements about governments making him problems on multiple occasions.
My theory is that the whole "Willy-Bot" ordeal was an attempt to buy back the lost coins (that were somehow related to SR) with their fiat reserves, but ended up sparking an unreal bubble which made buying back completely impossible - so Gox was over.

If it's possible that gambling serves as a distributed attack on the network, as luke always tries to paint it, then that's a problem with bitcoin's incentive structure, not something that can be permanently fixed by blacklisting one gambling service after another.

So it's very likely and generally agreed upon that it was gox themselves buying those coins.

How does that in any way accomplish "tracking them"?
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:02:41
Possible, but not definitely. It's a question of scalability. If we can have hundreds of thousands of transactions per block at one point, low fees can suffice as block reward to support the network with adequate security.

ELI5: How exactly does naked short selling drive down a price? As far as I understand it, you only sell the promise of buying a share for the other party at a later time, but setting the price at the current one. You still have to buy the share in the end, and before you do, there hasn't occured any real market action.
edit: On second thought, I think I get it. By selling the promise to a potential buyer, who would otherwise have purchased the share directly on the market, you delay his purchase and temporarily remove his demand. Do this enough and the price has to fall, allowing you to purchase it cheaper at a later time. Correct?

And what do you need xcp for then?
Now you're going to say something what you need them for. Then I'll say: "yeah and you don't need an intermediate coin to do that with colored coins".
Or you say you don't need xcp for *anything*, which renders them completely pointless.

Indeed they are. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:32:59
No, it isn't. Is that really not intuitively clear? All you're doing with the above (this is called ["selling short-against-the-box"]( is weakening (or overtaking) your long position and paying unnecessary fees for that. 
The only reason to do this (if ever) is to balance your positions out, so that you can neither gain nor lose anything, which can be used to move your gains into the next year, for tax reasons.
[Here, Wikipedia has an example]( of an actual hedge that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:08:11
There are a few others with similar models. [NiceHash]( offers renting out hash in a similar manner, only that it's not as centralized as GHash are. Everybody can go there and sell their own hash power.
But basically, they were the first to do this in a pretty perfect and efficient way. If there were more who'd do it so professionally, we wouldn't have such a centralisation problem right now. Competition and arbitrage between the different Hashing Exchanges would make it a more fair process.

This is a beta. Woopdeedoo, there are bugs. And this one really isn't even critical. It doesn't allow anyone to spend someone else's money, hurt the network's function or something like that.
It's something that could have been designed better, was a known issue for a long time, but wasn't high priority. Now Gox, due to their inability to implement Bitcoin properly, gave reason to it becoming a higher priority. That's all.

There **is** a huge "magic line" at 50%.
It's the important difference between *maybe* being able to pull off *one* double spend and losing a lot of money otherwise, and the knowledge that you *will* pull it off. 
It can also be the difference between mining 48% of all new bitcoins, and *mining every single one* and closing out all competitors. An entity with more than 50% is basically as good as one with 100%.
Mind though that none of that danger really exists with a **pool** "owning" 51% (they don't actually own shit).
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:43:13
There is still a very important difference between being *almost as fast* as the rest of the network, and being faster.
But there is also a very important difference between someone *actually having* more than 50% and being a pool owner with more than 50%. The first one can become the master of the bitcoin network, the second can maybe pull off one scam before the miners stop supporting him and he immediately loses all his power. And it's unlikely that one scam would be lucrative enough for this to be a smart idea.

Store them yourself. That means put the biggest part as your savings in an offline wallet (print a BIP38 password-encrypted paper wallet created on [bitaddress.org]( and leave some for spending and everything else accessible on your computer. The [KryptoKit]( browser extension is pretty cool for having your BTC always ready on-the-fly and your BTC are stored locally without relying on a third party service.
As much as I'd like to say that a service like Coinbase is probably pretty reliable at this point, you really never know. You'll sleep much better if you know that *no one* is able to take your coins. This being possible is one of the biggest reasons for having BTC anyway.

Valuable lesson how, what was learned? That you shouldn't fucking do it? That you simply can never trust a man-made and thus bug-prone, *unfixable* piece of software? That you need a turing-complete blockchain about as much as another hole in the head?
Smart contracts in bitcoin are very different, much less complex and powerful - and that is *on purpose*.
These news hardly affect bitcoin and bitcoin doesn't need to "learn" anything from it. It only validates the main criticism that smart people have had about ethereum from the beginning: that all the complexity and irreversibility of their "contracts" is a program for desaster in the case of the slightest bug.

Yes, the network is limited, every network is. But this network isn't limited by nature, it's artificially crippled for no good reason. And you are acting like it was a good justification for this artificial limit that there is an actual limit somewhere. That makes absolutely no sense.

I am curious what will happen when it's time for Segwit2x to truly activate and the blocksize increase to 2MB is due.
If the majority of bitcoin doesn't follow through with that, I think miners will leave for bitcoin cash (or do their own 2MB fork). That will be interesting.
I think large parts of the community have no grasp on what happened and either think Segwit2x is a sure thing now or they're shortsighted idiots and think "we tricked the stupid miners and now have segwit and we just won't do their blocksize increase".
So for me, this fork seems much less exciting and dangerous than what will happen in 3 months.

Nobody can know that. Electricity costs are different everywhere. In China, the electricity producers are now mining themselves with their excess energy, i.e basically for free. 
Maybe someone could try a bad estimation about this. 
Anyway, overall, it is **a lot** of energy going into mining. I'm amazed how it has kept growing exponentially over the last years. 


The number of transactions has nothing to do with mining, that's not how bitcoin works. Mining gets harder the more people mine, not the more people use bitcoin. However, when the price goes up, mining gets more profitable, which leads to more mining. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:55:21
I have no doubt miners will follow through, they're the ones that want bigger blocks. Some of the users (mainly the people here on this sub) don't want bigger blocks, and it stands to reason that they will not honor the "agreement".
For the 2x part of Segwit2x, there needs to be a hardfork, and there will probably be resistance against that from many people here.

Since you're not getting this, I'll try to be clearer. 
The question is: how is the existance of a natural limit for the network (like 3TB per week) a justification for setting an artificial limit that is much, much lower (1GB per week)?

@_date: 2015-08-07 18:44:02
The only true answer anyone can give you is that we don't know. There's a lot of speculation, but nobody has "found" them on the blockchain. Most believe that the coins that were "lost" never existed in the first place. 
I also wouldn't rule out that there was some sort of connection to the original Silk Road - MtGox's problems started manifesting around the time that they went bust. Maybe the feds confiscated a lot of coins from gox that belonged to SR, and suddenly gox's books didn't make sense anymore, so they started an idiotic plan to make up for the losses with fake coins on their exchange, insider trading and speculating on dropping prices. Which of course spectacularly failed when the price kept exploding, so at some point they had to come up with an explanation and just said they had been stolen/lost. Mayby, possibly, perhaps.
One thing is for sure though: the official explanation is a complete lie. Due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, it would be very easy to point out where the "stolen" or "lost" coins are, the fact that nothing was ever said about that is strong evidence for bullshit.

Yes, OK, but the WiFi part is not the crucial argument here, just the icing on the cake. 
The point is that there is really no logical point in making a heater that is already a bitcoin miner - because the bitcoin miners at work today are already exactly that. They turn electricity into heat. And as far as my physics education goes, other electrical heaters can't magically turn less electricity into more heat.

True. However, the way they measure your claim means that bitcoins weigh far heavier than fiat. For example, I bought ~8 bitcoins right before gox went bust, for about 100€ each, so costing about 800€. Filing my claim, these 8 bitcoins are now valued at ~350€ each, making a total of 2800€. 
The price they set for the coins is neither the price at time of gox closing, nor the current price. I have no idea how they arrived at that number.
If I were to get 30% of my claim (not gonna happen), I'd be in the weird situation of actually making a profit on those coins O_o
Generally, people with lots of coins on there should be pretty happy, and people with lots of fiat should be pretty pissed.

You said "the miner fee of .002, which would be $200,000k worth of that colored coin". I was pointing out that that's not how the value translates, in other words: it's not possible to say that a certain amount of bitcoin equals a certain amount of colored coin.


You need additional bitcoins for the fee, yes. Since colored coins operate on the bitcoin network, you need to pay the bitcoin network with the currency it understands: bitcoin. Colored coins are just an abstraction layer put on top, they have no meaning to the bitcoin network and so you obviously can't pay transaction fees with them.

That's not how colored coins work, at least not coinprism's implementation, which is the most advanced. It's a common misconception, because colored coins are easiest explained by saying that you "color a certain amount of bitcoin". It's not at all what actually happens though. 
The way it actually works is that each "operation" you do with colored coins costs the minimum amount possible, which is bitcoin's dust limit (about 600 satoshi) + miner's fees (about 0.0001, not 0.002). So in a first operation, you'd create, let's say, 1 billion coins, costing you 0.000106  btc. Then when you send 1 million of those coins to someone else, you do another transaction, again costing you 0.000106. Same when you'd send 100 coins, or any other amount.

I can honestly see the former working out better. Distributed open source consensus has a huge weakness in that it's basically a hardcore version of direct democracy, in which if not a big majority supports a decision one way or the other, *nothing* happens. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:07:34


Then just buy a bitcoin miner, because that's the same thing. The idea that "you'll clip the latest mining chip to your heater" comes from the misconception that somehow that heater will then produce more heat from the same energy than a regular bitcoin miner. It's not, that's basic thermodynamics: what goes in, comes out.
The only difference I can think of right now between a bitcoin miner and an electrical heater is that the miner is way more noisy, because it has to dissipate the local heat away from the chip very fast to keep it from burning, and it takes up way more space for the same reason.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:52:20
Compared to other heaters that rely on electricity, there wouldn't be much difference - all energy that goes in is eventually turned into heat.
But that's not the point. Revolutionizing the electrical heater industry with implemented ASICs that mine bitcoin is not going to be worth the effort. If it was, you'd fastly see an increase in difficulty that would make it not so.
I get that people think "well, you've got electrical heaters, and if you just put bitcoin miners in them, that's saving you money". But that's not true. All the cost that comes from putting a miner in such a device, also having wifi on it - which is necessary, even though otherwise totally unnecessary for a heater - is just not justified with the tiny, *tiny* profit from mining. You'd literally make cents (if even) in a month of continuously running your electrical heater. Something, which by the way, nobody who'd really rely on heating would do for longer periods of time, since it's very cost-inefficient compared to other methods of heating (as far as I know, everywhere). The costs to make, run, and market such devices would just never pay off.
Bitcoin mining is meant to be specialized, that's just in the nature of the thing. It's meant to be *barely* profitable, in optimal environments. Putting miners into everyday devices, i.e *not* optimal environments, is always going to be a losing business.
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:06:22
It makes no sense to be emphasizing a "theoretical maximum" while leaving out a big fat condition to that theoretical maximum, which is very much not set in stone. 
Aside from that, I might also point out that the on-chain transaction amount is not nearly as important as the fact that there **is** working on-chain settlement. There can be unlimited trusted transfers that are still profiting from a solid untrusted base. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:41:44
Where is it negative? Are you talking about heat pumps? If so, that's not what I'm comparing, because there's not really the possibility of putting a bitcoin miner into the heat pump process that I can think of.

Yes, that would make more sense.
Could have also just stayed with the original name^^cough ^^cough: **BitGold**.
Also would make more sense for the units. Right now we talk about 1 Bit"coin", as if that was some discrete unit instead of an infinitely divisble lump of something. No wonder noobs are totally confused by this. "What, 200 bucks for just ONE bitcoin, are you kidding me?"
If this was BitGold instead, you wouldn't say you own "one bitgold", instead you'd say you own "one ounce of bitgold", or "one kilogram of bitgold" etc. Makes a whole lot more sense intuitively. And if you tell a noob that there's only ever going to be 21 million kilo of bitgold, compared to the ~170 million kilo of physical gold that have already been mined, he'd immediately understand why it can be considered cheap for a kilo to cost more than 200 dollars.
I know this is never going to happen though. I don't even think any altcoin has ever done this properly, all just following in the bad example set by bit"coin", even taking on the inappropriate "---coin" name.

The problem is that you have to have a very big majority agreeing on a change like this, otherwise nasty things happen, like the Bitcoin blockchain splitting in two, where people on one side of the argument use a bitcoin software that works like A and another bitcoin software that works like B, with those two not being compatible.

Not a bullshit argument. While it's true that you need multiple confirmations in short-blocktime environments (like doge) to reach the same confidence of 1 confirmation in a long-blocktime one, 1 confirm in short-blocktime is still infinitely more confident than 0 confirm in long-blocktime. 
Going by your reasoning, we could have 3-day blocktimes. Why make it shorter, I mean these confirmations would be reeeeally safe amiright?

If the technology was widely available, it wouldn't be that big of a problem, that's correct. It would still be a problem if asicboost stop certain improvements to the protocol from being implemented just because of [the way it works]( But aside from that, if only one big mining company owns a legal patent on the technology (which Bitmain does), over time this obviously leads to heavy mining centralization, which is definitely dangerous.
*However*, Bitmain has [already agreed to make the technology public]( in the past. This fight is not, and has never been, about asicboost. Stop focusing on that, it's a smokescreen, it's nonsense. Bitmain/Jihan Wu/whatever want a blocksize increase, as do many, many, other people in Bitcoin. There have been compromises, and agreements, and none were held up, and now they're using SegWit activation as leverage. 
Just do a fucking blocksize-increase-hardfork, use it to get other HF-requiring changes in, and be happy. We'll have SegWit, we'll have bigger Bitcoin blocks, everything's good.

Googling you address shows that you have already plastered it all over the interwebs, and have used it in 8718 transactions already. Are you aware that you are using Bitcoin wrong? You shouldn't reuse addresses, certainly not to that extent.

You can cry about it, but if you directly want to use the Bitcoin blockchain, then yeah, that's what you have to do.

You're not wrong that market cap is not necessarily the most useful number if there's no liquidity in the market. But it's the same situation with stocks. A very large number of shares don't get traded regularly at all. People are sitting on them just like they're sitting on bitcoins. Often when companies issue shares, less than 50% get traded publicly. The private shares still add to the market cap.

The thing is that between the user ordering and him getting his shipment, the money stays in escrow - held by the site.

Yes, it would become two seperate currencies.

Ripple is a joke, it shouldn't be on that list since the number is completely meaningless. It's a pre-mined coin, they're hogging literally billions of coins that have never been in circulation.
Litecoin should just die, it literally makes me angry how it even still exists up there while being so fucking pointless.
Monero will be going much higher. The technology is sound and it has a clear purpose and advantages over bitcoin. Anonymity is a major selling point for crypto-currency, and monero offers that in a way no other crypto does. Aside from that, it has a lower total number of coins than Bitcoin which will all have been distributed within the next few years.
I think Ethereum is still way overvalued for what it is imo. Much theoretical hoopla that is *kinda* interesting on a tech level, but pretty much impractical and useless in the real world, while being prone to terrible costly mistakes (they needed to hardfork because of a simple coding mistake in one of the applications of their "contracts" - how fucked up is that?). The world needs a turing complete blockchain as much as I need another hole in my head. On top of that, a big part of Ethereum is premined and hogged by the devs. So the market cap and price are not really realistic.

Are you sure? Got any source on that? Not saying you're necessarily wrong, I just haven't heard anything about that, and find it a bit strange. Did they meet beforehand with all participants of the syndicate and negotiate for a bidding price they were all comfortable with? 


It's not much different to the original concept. It's basically a silent auction within this silent auction. If you're bidding too low, you might not get into the bidding pool of the syndicate (if there's only one), or be in a lower tier pool with a lower average bet. Nobody knows what the optimal bid is (to be the lowest bidder in the bidding block), so everybody has to guess. It's not "unfair", it's an estimation game and a bit of gambling, like any silent auction.

That statement doesn't mean anything. He could just as well have said he bid double the spot price. And I don't mean he could be lying, I mean it doesn't mean anything. 
These bidding syndicates work by weighing and averaging their bidders. What ONE bidder says he bid is completely irrelevant. If he bid $1000 per coin for 20 coins total, and the other 1980 coins have an average bid of $100, the syndicate would bid $109 per coin. And when they don't get the stack then, he'd twitter around that he bid $1000 and didn't win, trying to get everyone to believe the winning bid had to be higher, which is nonsense.

Someone asked me to elaborate on the security implications of address reusage, then deleted his comment. Since I didn't want my answer to go to waste, here you go:
When signing bitcoin transactions, you take your public key, and need to create a random number for signing. If that random number has been used before to sign another transaction for the same public key, the *private* key can be calculated. If you're taking the random number out of a big enough pool, there's no realistic chance they would ever repeat, but with a bad random number generator...
This happened multiple times. Like [described here]( Also, in 2013, [there was a bug found in Android's random number generator thanks to bitcoin]( Addresses reused on Android wallets had been emptied by thieves.

Bitcoin doesn't fit in there. All the other payment solutions are just put on top of a different payment system. They use credit cards, or your bank account, to pay for you. Bitcoin is its own payment system, and in that, fundamentally different.
Not saying it doesn't make sense to compare what different options a consumer has, but it's an unfair comparison this way.

You're implying that it's somehow immature to not want to be a banker, and that adults want to be bankers. Kids don't know any better, but real grown up people see the money and think "OH YEA!", right?
The truth is that it's not a very *adult* thing, not a *wise* thing, to want to be an ego-centric, greedy workaholic that is always on the lookout to exploit others.

Nothing really "changes". There's no block reward anymore, so the miners will have to live off the fees they gain from transactions. But that's not a sudden thing, the block reward will have been gradually decreasing for decades, and when it disappears, miners will already almost completely depend on fees anyway. In principle, the block reward also doesn't have to completely go away, it can just continue halving forever.


The limit is 21 million just results from an initial block reward of 50 bitcoins. When you pay out 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes, and then halve that reward after 4 years, and then again after 4 years and so forth, you end up with an upper limit of 21m coins.
So the question isn't actually "Why 21m coins?" but rather "Why 50 coins initial block reward?". And the answer is: for no reason. It doesn't matter what number you pick. Could have been 500, or 7172. The only possible influence it has is psychological, because humans are bad in dealing with numbers.

Most coins in circulation are "owned" by exchanges (they hold the private key). The initial coin distribution on this alt chain would therefore be extremely unfair, and exchange owners would probably just crash them for quick profit. 
Also, anyone could theoretically just buy a big amount of bitcoins right before the time of the snapshot, then sell them again right after, and had the altcoins as free profit. A snapshot at some random point just doesn't make much sense. 
Using sidechains to lock actual bitcoins out of the bitcoin blockchain to obtain an altcoin is a much better method to do this.

You kinda ride this point and use it to say that you can't think of another way to want to use that other than a government-free currency. 
But it's wrong. Bitcoin is not "a ledger designed to avoid censorship". Never was. 
**Blockchains are ledgers designed to achieve trustless consensus.** And there is very much reasons and applications for that aside from currency. The reason banks are finally starting to be all over the blockchain idea is because they have this thing called "settlement", that in the world of traditional finance just takes forever. Days, even weeks pass until these different banks, branches, units, whatever, actually settle on what is good and valid and goes in everyone's books.

The proverb is used exactly right, and yes it is perfectly applicable for investing - in the context of someone in the dilemma of wanting to do something (invest in bitcoin), but being conflicted about it being too late - kicking themselves about not doing it earlier, but thinking they missed the train. That's what the proverb is about: "you didn't do it before as you should have, so just do it now." Yes, you don't know whether it might drop tomorrow, but if it's a solid investment, it doesn't matter in the long run. 
The evaluation of the investment has happened before, the conflict is only about the time of investment. And it *is* good to not be concerned with short time fluctuations when doing proper long time investing. That is true everywhere, it has nothing to do with bitcoin. You could have invested money in stocks right before the financial crisis and you'd still be a lot richer a few years later, after the storm has settled. Pussies who keep moving the goalpost further and further are the losers when it comes to investing - being constantly afraid of what might happen, so they end up doing nothing. Only to complain a few years later "Oh my God why didn't I just do X a few years ago". Because you're a pussy, that's why. And it's for those people that this proverb applies. 




Your opinion of bitcoin and whether or not you believe it is a good investment is the only thing irrelevant here. It's annoyingly transparent what you're actually trying to say, so you can just stop your concern trolling. Bitcoin is a perfectly good investment in a diversified portfolio. Nobody here ever has or ever will tell you to put all your money in it. But it is empirically proven to be a damn good investment. Boohoo that you didn't have the balls or financial foresight to invest in it, but no amount of mind gymnastics and misrepresenting chinese proverbs is going to change that.

No, the difficulty is set approx. every 2 weeks so that the time between blocks is averaging 10 minutes again. If miners drop out, the hash rate goes down and it takes longer on average than 10 minutes to find a block. The difficulty would go down, making it more probable to find a block, making the average 10 minutes again.
Within this 2016 block timeframe, every block is mined with the same difficulty.
[- Current Difficulty &amp; stats](  
[- Difficulty explained in the bitcoin wiki](  
- [The Bitcoin clock]( (helps to visualize Bitcoin's "episodes")
For the rest of your post... If I understand you correctly, you're asking whether an already mined block can be smuggled into the chain with different content, but the same hash? That's an interesting question. I think it's safe to say that for all intends and purposes, that's impossible. While it's a fact that different blocks *can* theoretically result in the same hash (should be intuitively clear when knowing that when hashing, *long* data gets reduced to *short* data), the possibilty of finding 2 different, *yet valid* bitcoin blocks resulting in the same hash is so abysmally small, there's really no point in searching for it. It's like asking why you can't randomly get the same private key that someone else already used. 
The next issue would be that even when having found such a unicorn, you wouldn't get other people to use your block. They would see they have it already and deny loading it from you again. You could perhaps spread it to someone who hasn't loaded the blockchain yet and result in him having corrupted data, but that's about it. At no point would anyone's bitcoins be in danger.


Perhaps. But the general population is not supposed to understand the depth of the process. They should, because understanding stuff is good. But not understanding stuff doesn't need to stop them from using it. I don't really know much about cars, yet I trust them to drive me around at speeds at which they can easily kill me. Don't even get me started on airplaines.
You probably don't know much about the details of the traditional banking system either, and  how your money is moved around there. You just trust it because everyone trusts it. And that is how it is with everything. Bitcoin is still far away from that point where everyone just uses it without having to think about it. But if its security passes the test of time, there's really no reason I can see why it can't be like that.
OK, I need to end this long post now. Sorry if my english wasn't too good.

It's a compromise that is desperately needed. Segwit is fine, and finally increasing the blocksize would show at least some level of on-chain scaling. Without on-chain scaling, bitcoin is crippled and dead in the water long term. No, it won't handle all of the world's finances on-chain, that's why 2nd layer solutions are also important. But sticking to a ridiculous arbitrary 1MB limit is nonsense. Even with the idea of bitcoin only being a "settlement ground layer" - with 1MB blocks it won't even be good enough for that if the whole world were to use it. It's not enough to settle the whole world, end of story. And the network can *easily* handle multiple times that. There is no way the (mostly theoretical) loss of "decentralization" is worth crippling and dooming the network like this. 
There was a time when pretty much everybody agreed that the blocksize had to be increased, there was mostly conflict about *how* and *when*. And now, years of bitcoin civil war later we have this situation where either side just completely refuses any compromise. No doubt this agreement won't "pass" either, just like the last one didn't, the one that core developers signed and then didn't follow. Achieving actual consensus in this environment has become literally impossible. 
If you look at either side, it's just shit slinging now. The character assassination attempts are just fucking embarrassing. Everybody is apparently a paid shill/troll or a scammer and generally the absolute worst scum of the earth. The way Jihan is currently described on this sub and the ridiculous conspiracy theories people come up with to explain someone not agreeing with them is absurd. The same on the other side, where lead core developers who have spent so much of their time and work on bitcoin are dragged through the mud like they're criminals. It is pathetic. 
All that's happened to bitcoin has me really doubting the experiment overall. Maybe open source is a terrible concept for this type of grand project. A blocksize increase should have been a relatively minor decision and even that was enough to split the entire community and turn them into an ugly bunch of hateful hyenas, for years, with no end in sight.

As laid out in [your second link]( Bitmain says they've always been supportive of segwit, as long as there would also be on-chain scaling (increase in blocksize). This ASICBOOST theory doesn't really add up. If they were just concerned about their profitability from ASICBOOST, they wouldn't advocate for a bigger blocksize either, and they wouldn't be in favor of SegWit to begin with.
What is questionable to me - and I might just be way out of the loop here - is what happened to the [Hongkong Agreement]( which Bitmain and plenty others, including Core developers, agreed on? If the agreed upon path would have been followed, as Bitmain pointed out, SegWit would already be running just fine. Are there any good reasons why this agreement from so many important people has just been thrown into the trash, except for petty politics?
edit: I just read there's been [a new consensus]( a few days ago, basically agreeing on the same thing as before (SegWit + 2MB blocksize increase/hardfork). Still, why this long delay? Will this one be implemented?
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:13:52


Yes. They already pay them today.


Today, they are. That's why today, a block reward is necessary to have sufficient security of the system. If the reward for miners is high, then more miners mine =&gt; more security for the system.
But if you imagine 1000x more people using Bitcoin, fees alone can easily be enough to pay for good security.
What you need to take away from this is that it's a self regulating system. If the fees are not enough to pay all the miner's electricity costs, then more and more miners will stop mining until the reward is enough again for the rest of the miners. The security will be lower, because fewer people are mining, but the system will still work just as before.


You will never have *nobody* mining, or "the currency literally grinding to a halt", as long as bitcoins have value. Theoretically, Bitcoin works just fine if there's only 10 people in the whole world who are mining. The only problem with that is that it's easier for someone evil to come along, match the computing power of these 10 people and take over the network (51% attack).

Ah, thanks. Yeah, now that I see it, I remember that. I shrugged it off as useless and *very* probably fake at the time.

@_date: 2015-03-13 20:12:59
Huh. I always liked the name as the best name for a crypto yet.
"Monero" is "Currency" in [Esperanto]( A decentralized language for a decentralized currency.
Instead having every altcoin end with "-coin" is fucking stupid. Doing that was already bad when Bitcoin did it. They are not coins, and in no way are they digital coins. Coins are discrete units, bitcoins are infinitely divisible. The whole thing is just confusing. "Bitgold" would have been the better name, ~~Szabo~~ Satoshi should have sticked with that.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:23:01
It also fixes malleability, afaik. What it does *not* do is be an overly complex scaling solution that can be done much easier, less error prone and more efficient with a simple block size increase. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:00:51


Talking about this in absolute terms is ridiculous.
Say something is priced at $500, and person A predicts a price of $10 while person B predicts a price of $750, and the price ends up being $350. Then *yeah*, person A is closest in *absolute* terms, yet it was a completely idiotic prediction.
When looking at this, you need to look at the *factor* of the price change predicted. Sure there are people suggesting a 10x increase withing a year, but this alleged professional economist suggested a 50x+ decrease. That is ridiculous and *that* is why he is still mocked. First of all for making the idiotic prediction in the first place, and then for being absolutely and undeniably **wrong**. Currently wrong by a factor of 28, like someone who'd have predicted ~$8000 for now. At the actual time he set for his prediction (summer '14 I believe), he was even a lot more wrong, about as wrong as someone who guessed $36000.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:34:53

When TED started out, it was great people giving interesting speeches and I could sit there and watch one after another, hooked to the screen. Today I feel like there's more people tooting their own horn instead of spreading wisdom and more spiritual and pseudo-science crap instead of actual science. It often feels really circlejerky.
It's totally possible though that actually I and my taste are what has changed more over time than the speakers at TED.

Because it is *not* just a fix, but an overcomplicated scaling solution. The proper thing to do is to do the fix *and* do the easy scaling first - by increasing the block size. 


Oh, really? Have you heard about Jihan, or his other name, SATAN? Did you know there is this conspiracy called ASICBOOST which is the real reason people want bigger blocks? Not because it is the easy and obvious answer to a lot of current problems, it is because of crazy conspiracy theories and evil Chinese miners!

No, it wasn't. Never was, never will be. If someone told you that, he doesn't know what he's talking about. 
The bitcoin system does nothing to prevent wealth inequality, as it doesn't magically prevent human greed or the fact that some people are better at making money than others. 
If you're arguing to prevent wealth inequality, you'll always be arguing for some sort of "greater power", like a government, to redistribute the wealth.  Such a power is highly dependent on trust and can therefore never be an intrinsic part of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 11:23:43


The allegation is that it was NOT gained honestly and fairly. You are stating that it was as if that was a fact, when actually it's exactly what has to be determined in court.
If someone stole all your money, you'd be in favor of him being allowed to use your money to defend himself, pay the best lawyers in the country and go from court to court until all your money is blown away?
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:07:47
Yes, we don't know what the future holds.
But keep in mind that the switch from GPUs to ASICs was not because some new technology had emerged. Everybody knew about ASICs, it's just that they can only be mass-produced and that required too big of an investment for the small bitcoin community.
It's like switching from calculating everything in your head to calculating with the help of a computer, once you could finally afford one.
There's nothing like that coming up, there's nothing we just need to buy or build to see huge increases again. We're at the frontline of innovation now, and it's very unrealistic to expect efficiency increases of 10,000x or more like we had when switching from GPUs to ASICs.
ASICs are dedicated hardware, they don't do anything else than mining bitcoin. That's why it was a huge leap from general purpose calculators (CPUs and then GPUs) to them. Dedicated hardware is already dedicated. The future increases in performance are only due to optimization, better fabrication etc. But they're not groundbreaking, unless the whole model of computing changes. Maybe you'll see a doubling of efficiency per year, which would still be impressive, but that's about it. A 100% increase is nothing compared to a 1000000% one.

Anyone remember [Labcoin]( (914 pages lol)? Oh man, good times. Made more than 40 btc in the first night just by playing their scammy IPO.

@_date: 2017-07-13 14:37:08
No, he is right. It is basically advise for people to sell their bitcoin. Which, as he is also right, is pretty insane advice from a bitcoin site.
It should clear up what happens on the network (as it does) and what people should look out for or how they should refrain from using the network for that time. It should *not* tell people (or suggest it at all) to divest from bitcoin, that is absolutely not the place. While the term is heavily misused here all the time, that is literally what "FUD" is.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:36:14


No, but it's the wrong approach, doesn't work and often relies on third parties. The right solution is to use a truly fungible, private crypto like Monero (actually only Monero). 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:00:01
Possibly the bitcoin price. They still have tens of thousands of coins that they might have to liquidate to pay back customers. But it's all just speculation.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:58:35


Illicitly attaining the funds is the crime, like selling illegal drugs for money. That's the crime. The money itself that results from this, is just money. Moving that should not be a crime in and off itself. 
And the only reason it is one, is because it makes law enforcement easier, since Anti-ML laws cut deep into people's privacy. And it works. Of course you catch bad guys easier if you force *everyone* to reveal the source of all their money. But that doesn't make it right. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:59:14

Try not to fantasize too much there, little buddy. I gave the reason why these regulations exist, I'm neither saying that they are infallible nor that I trust them. 
You know what you can use if you don't trust them? A decentralized currency that has been invented for the sole purpose of giving people back control over their money. You know what is the wrong approach? Keeping that decentralized currency on a centralized, unregulated, sketchy exchange and then whining when shit hits the fan. That is idiotic. And yes, when I'm forced to use a centralized exchange, I'm going to use a regulated one if I can. Because I'm not a fucking retard.

A closed mining system that only the FED had control of wouldn't make sense at all. There wouldn't need to be a mining system at all if that was the case. And your question wouldn't make sense, because if they are the only one that have control over it, who could 51% attack it and how?

Well, interesting then, that the [wikipedia article on obstruction of justice]( specifically mentions this:


Anyway, I'm sick of talking to you, you condescending little shit, and I'll stop doing that right now.
You still haven't made the slightest point whatsoever about what you think the crime of money laundering even *is*. Instead, while acting like an annoying little faggot, you turned this into a little hypothetical play about murder weapons, which I regret very much joining in on.

So according to you, it's a network of exclusion? Even though there's literally not a single technical reason to keep Bitcoin's transactional capabilities, and thus its usefulness to society limited, you just want to do so to keep people out, out of the weird idea that it will make space in a block more valuable?


It never has been, as there was never scarcity of space before.
I honestly don't understand how someone can think that limiting the amount of people that can use Bitcoin will actually increase its value.


How so? Block size has no influence on the number of coins in circulation.

What is working for them? Trading without identification? No, it isn't. With bitcoin.de, the process is more complicated (you need to go in person to a post office and they verify your ID and that you're the person on it). At least with Kraken you don't need to go and stand in line anywhere.
And I don't know what other german bitcoin sites you could mean. Because that's pretty much it.

Yes, pretty sure that's the plan.
It doesn't work for oil, because everyone speculating doesn't want to actually *store* the oil, just have it on paper. With something as flexible as bitcoin, that's no problem. It's not much of a logistical effort for the ETF to store the actual coins.

OK...... so instead of "Sell!" you think the 3 possible messages conveyed are:
(1) Don't buy any Bitcoin!
(2) Buy something else with your money, just please *don't buy any Bitcoin!*
(3) Save money on groceries! You don't need a vacation every year! Turn off the light in rooms you're not using! Designer clothes are for hipsters!
While (3) might give some good advice, it seems a little out of place for a bitcoin site, just like the rest.

Users don't care where developers offer their apps. They expect the apps to be on Google play, or they don't exist. And therefore, every developer puts them on Google play. The free market would say that because developers could offer their apps cheaper on non-google-play stores, users would also migrate there. 
And that this isn't happening is exactly what I meant. Users get the play store bundled with their gadgets and because of people's lazyness and ignorance, that creates network effects and an unbreakable monopoly, one that is strong enough to suck up 30% of the money flowing through.
And about the Amazon store... First of all, it costs the same 30% that Google makes you pay, plus an initial $100 fee to create a "developer account". But that's beside the point. The only people who use the Amazon store are the people who are forced to use it on Amazon devices, which is exactly the same thing as with Google bundled devices.

ETFs for oil are tricky though. This goes for pretty much all resources, aside from precious metals. The "ETFs" don't always follow the underlying asset well. That is because they don't actually buy the asset, but instead speculate on the futures market for the resources. You can get screwed in a number of ways if you just think "oh I'll buy this certificate and now I have oil" - that's not how it works.

The production cost idea doesn't work at all for bitcoin, never has. If you know how mining works, you know that ultimately, price determines mining difficulty (and thus production cost), not the other way around. 
With gold or traditional goods, you can spend more money and will mine more of it, increasing the rate at which the supply increases. That doesn't work in bitcoin, by design. The rate of supply increase is fixed (**and** halving every 4 years). With a traditional good, if the price doubled, you would see increased production, more of the good would flood the market which would make the price drop again, ultimately creating a balance between production cost and price (at least in theory, there are a number of practical reasons this often doesn't work in reality either). But with bitcoin, increased mining only means the miners make it more difficult, they are under no circumstances able to increase the total output of the system. Every miner is just trying to get a larger piece of the cake *for themselves*, but the cake never changes in size.

That's a very tiny fraction of the ~~buy~~ volume. Which is made up mostly of people trading back and forth, not just people constantly buying. I would very much disagree with your assumption that sucking 3k btc per day out of circulation over months doesn't affect the price (a lot).


In *that* moment maybe. It's impossible to see the effects of decreasing supply just by looking how it affects the market in that very moment. When there's 1100 btc offered at a specific ask price, and then the bot buy 1k, that doesn't move the price a single cent, so what? There's still only 100 btc resistance left at that point which means the price will move easier, eventually.

"Shorting" basically means betting on a falling price of an asset.
You borrow the asset from someone else (usually paying interest for the time while it's lended to you), then immediately sell it on the market. When the price falls, you can then rebuy the asset cheaper and give it back to the person you borrowed it from. 
Price1 - Price2 - InterestPaid = Your Profit
One drawback to consider is that your potential for loss when shorting is theoretically infinite. If you borrow some bitcoin and sell them, anticipating a falling price, and then the news come out that bitcoins cure cancer, you're shit out of luck and still have to buy them back at the new price of 26.5 million dollars. In practice, this is prohibited by you putting up "collateral": If you want to short, you have to put a certain amount of money to the side that you can't touch, and that will be used to rebuy coins, in case the price goes up. If the price goes up so dramatically that the collateral isn't enough to buy the coins back, then the person you borrowed from is out of luck and doesn't get all his coins back - that's the risk on their side and the reason they get paid interest.

It says he's in the beta group to try out the new express-trading.
That express trading feature that they planned for a long time basically works like this: you have a bank account with their partner, the fidor bank. Now when you buy coins on bitcoin.de, it automatically takes money from your bank account and transfers it to the fidor bank account of the seller.

edit: btw, this is just assumption, I have no idea why they're closed now, could be anything. But I don't have any doubt that the concept doesn't work. Or at least doesn't work for somebody who isn't cheating.

Hm, I don't know what you don't understand. Producing the necessary hardware is way cheaper in China, obviously. Also low electricity cost etc. 
Yes, the difficulty for mining is reevaluated every ~2k blocks. Right now, the important thing is the arms race - the people who get the efficient mining gear (ASICs) sooner, can make a lot more money, before the difficulty rises. But eventually, it reaches an equilibrium, when the power costs are as high as the profit. And then the only people who can still make good profit are the ones with very cheap power.

That's only a psychological difference. If the seller prices his miners in dollars, you can just calculate what these dollars are worth in bitcoins at the time of purchase and have the same situation.
And no merchant "just wants bitcoin", they all need to pay their suppliers in fiat.

Hahaha MP is always good for some lols. If you frequent the bitcointalk boards, you have probably seen his shill MPOE-PR in action. 
For those that don't know about him: he is a mentally ill (not kidding) guy from romania. He owns [MPEx, the ugliest bitcoin security exchange in existance]( and thinks that makes him somehow important. Here's the best bit: he charges 30 BTC for someone to be allowed to use his service. Not decent fees, nothing like that: he wants you to pay 30 BTC up front just for you to have the "privilege" of being able to use his website. Of course, his service is dying and most new bitcoin users have no idea anymore who this clown is. He's fighting against that with all he's got by running around and reminding everyone how important he is.
Supposedly, MPOE-PR (the account on bitcointalk) is this girl that works for him, and he himself has no account on bitcointalk, but yeah.. there's a good chance that those two are just one and the same person, which would again show how deeply disturbed he is.
He keeps himself busy by spreading hate and racism and calling literally *everything* that comes up in the bitcoin economy a scam and spends a lot of time trying to find  strange connections that he thinks validate his insane paranoia. Then when he gets anything right (since it has to happen eventually) he makes posts like this, praising himself. 
If you think it is a joke when he says that "he is our god" and that we "should bow to him", you're wrong - he is dead serious. Like I said, he is a seriously mentally ill person. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:40:51
He stopped posting on bitcointalk, but he wasn't gone until way into 2011. Andresen and Hearn both kept talking to him (I think mostly via email). And when he finally left, he said so - that he'd use his time for other projects. He didn't die.

Yes. One important thing to understand is that your bitcoins are not "in" that wallet.dat file. They are stored in the network. The wallet just holds the private keys that "unlock" the addresses that hold your bitcoin.
So if you could memorize the private keys to your addresses, the bitcoins would be just as safe "in your brain" as they are in a wallet.dat.

You don't need to find the change address and get its private key.
You create a brand new address (paper wallet) and just send all your coins there. If your 4 leftover BTC are scattered over AddressA, AddressB, and AddressC, the wallet will just take it from all those addresses when it makes the transaction. It doesn't matter to you if there are change addresses involved, all you have to care about is that you send all your coins to the new address.

Uhm... that's not even their main business. Their main business is mining themselves. The "selling hardware" even only came up because they had too much hardware and there was basically ZERO competition. And there still is practically none. They are the only ones who deliver on sale and not just offer some shady pre-order (that as we have seen numerous times now, is a bad idea).
The deman for hardware from AM is still very, very, very high. The prices were really high (I'd say over the top even) and people still couldn't get enough. When the prices get lower and the hardware better in a few weeks (that has been announced), I have absolutely not a hint of a doubt that the demand will easily eat it up again.

I didn't know anything about this stuff before I came into BTC a few years ago. It really got me interested in the whole world of finance.

That's just a random rule of thumb though. It isn't hardcoded into the market, it's just the market behaving as a market.

You got to be kidding. Look at a graph of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years or so and tell me again august was the end of a cycle / a recession.

This get repeated a lot, even by some financial "experts", so it's not surprising you read it somewhere. It's called "dollar cost averaging" and it is basically a fallacy. You gain nothing that way over just investing a lump sum. 
Humans aren't intuitively good with numbers and want to believe that their investment style somehow mitigates risk, so myths like that will live on. But math clearly shows it doesn't work.

You were the one quoting the rule. I think that "rule" isn't a rule at all.


That's the same. There is no instant 50% drop there. It's (supposed to be) a cycle. Drops are usually faster than rises, but it still happens over years. 
Also nice how the graph conveniently stops right before it completely breaks pattern. Not that it isn't evident enough with the start of the graph that the pattern is cherrypicked to begin with.

And now you're just wearing it with pride.
Seriously though, try to get out of that conspiracy bullshit. Don't believe everything some people tell you just because it "kinda sorta makes sense". It's all a bunch of misinterpreted nonsense, pulled out of context, or even just made up completely. 
Take for example that "famous" quote from Nathan blahbla Rothschild that you people love so much (it took a grand total of 2 and a half minutes in your video to come up). There's nothing indicating that he *ever* said that. No evidence at all. It's made up bullshit that gets passed from one conspiracy freak to the next, as if it was a fact. And it's not like it would even be so bad if he *did* actually say that, but it goes a long way in showing how retarded these theories are. 
Conspiracy theories always fall for the fallacy: assuming a stupidly simple system in place. They are a way to explain the world, and why bad things happen, for people who cannot grasp the real complexity of the situation. They take little bits of obvious truth, (like that central banks have power, duh) blow it completely out of proportion and turn it into this theory to explain why everything is so bad in the world.
Believe me, there are far more talented and powerful journalists out there than some lunatics on the internet, who ramble on about it in youtube videos. **If** there was such a conspiracy, it would be found out and uncovered by **them**.
I'm giving you good advice here: turn away from that crap, it doesn't lead to anything. But I know you'll probably not listen to me anyway.

Nowhere did friedcat ever say something like that. That is pure speculation by you and other people because AM was at about 25% for a while... it might be true, it might be not, but it's definitely not a publicly declared target of AM. Considering we're over 30% right now suggests that it's not.

I think the fundamentals of bitcoin are as solid as ever and they're great. Bitcoin could be a great tool for the world if it finds mainstream adoption. The problem is that mainstream adoption doesn't just happen because something is good. Many people on this planet don't know about bitcoin, and frankly, many people on this planet are quite stupid. They won't start using them because "they're basically a good idea", only if they become so easy to use and access that every idiot is better off using them instead of fiat. Development is ongoing, and I believe we'll continue to see better and better solutions that utilize bitcoin in new ways, and that will help with that. That's my hope and expectation. I could be completely wrong though.

And when I'm talking to a fucking 15-year-old kid who's wishing he could pay for more porn with bitcoin, I'm going to give him the good advice to stay away from that, just as I would if he's telling me he wanted to buy some MDMA from silkroad.

It's not a bubble if the good is heavily undervalued. 1 bitcoin is more scarce on this planet than a few kg of gold. If it finds enough adoption (which it looks right now like it will), the price will reflect that scarcity and that means it is still **heavily** undervalued.

In the bitcoin protocol, there is no decimal places or decimal point. The bitcoin-value is in satoshi, as in 1 Bitcoin in the code = a value of 100000000.
What we need to do to increase the number of "decimal places" or to "move the decimal point" (the semantics you're arguing over) is change the meaning of "1" in the code. That's a big change with risks. It involves a hard fork of the blockchain.

Yeah, good for you, but to be honest, that was a pretty stupid bet for you to make (instead of just buying coins worth $1000 at the time, which would be at least $10k now), and even more stupid by your friend to not do the obvious hedge this opportunity offers. 
I would have gladly accepted that bet too, even if I believed in Bitcoin. Take the bet, buy 2 april bitcoins for &lt;200$ total, and be completely hedged. **However it plays out, I win *at least* $800.**
Really, it's ridiculously stupid to do this bet and not come up with this.

You're doing exactly the right thing. Don't ever think you have to do what the other sheep do. They might think they can "time the market", but they really can't. Maybe they are lucky a few times, and then they get burned hard and it was all for nothing.
This thread is btw already full with the same kind of people, as is this whole sub, every day. *Just be smarter than they are.* Ignore the noise and see what's real.
But don't get mad at them for thinking this way. Not only is getting angry and bitter not helping anyone, but also not everyone has to be as involved in the bitcoin-idea as you are, and making fiat out of bitcoin is a perfectly natural way for it to evolve. Getting people greedy is the biggest motivator bitcoin has to offer to go mainstream.

The thing that I could observe so far is though, that regular non-techy people only really start to dig into the subject after they have bitcoin themselves. So maybe it's just more natural for people to be interested in the topics that already concern them.
I have a friend who I convinced to take 20€ in bitcoin when I had forgotten my wallet at a bar. He had close to zero knowledge or interest before, even though I wouldn't shut up about it. Now he's all over it and just as invested as I am.
Maybe it's not so bad if people buy it because they're foolish, then stay because they're smart.

I've asked myself that too, and I don't think there is any valid reason. A sudden halving is almost definitely worse than a gradual change. Just look at how everyone is anticipating it, hoping for a sudden explosion in price. Do you think that's healthy for a currency? No, it distorts the market and even the transactional properties of Bitcoin by miners dropping out in drones. 
Imagine if bitcoin was actually a globally accepted currency, what kind of a collosal event the halving would be.
I personally believe this would be another good thing to be changed in a hard fork, but knowing damn well this will never happen.

Very possible. Done it a lot of times. Sometimes the spread is **ridiculous**. Yesterday, there was about a $150 difference between bitcoin.de and Bitstamp.
But as OP said, the difficult thing is moving the fiat around. But if you have a lot of money sitting at the various exchanges, it's basically free money.

Just quoting for emphasis, so everyone really internalises this.
It's also important to know that this also means that it doesn't **have to** grow in value, like some people seem to think. When the economy *doesn't* grow, the value can stagnate or decrease naturally in the same way.

Cold storage doesn't necessarily mean having it on an offline computer. Cold storage can also just mean a paper wallet, or anything actually, you just need to put the private key of your address down somewhere safe and offline.
If you're concerned with your roommate going through your stuff, you can always get creative... split the paper containing the key in two parts, one that you keep at home, and one that you give to someone you trust. Then even if he finds the half-key he can't do anything with it. Or you could use a brainwallet that consists of an innocent relatively long sentence + a unique password that you memorize. If he finds the innocent sentence written down somewhere, he doesn't know what it is, and even if he does, he'd have to bruteforce your password. Or, well, just put it on a USB stick, password encrypted via true crypt. Or one of a hundred other ways I could think of right now. Really, just get a little creative and your roommate has no chance of getting your private key.
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:13:53
I see your points, but that's all very risky speculation, and in my opinion, the risk doesn't justify the reward, by far. I'm going to address some of your points:


And when they go down? Then the share will be overvalued, fall in price and if the dividends paid until then haven't covered the difference, the shareholder loses out. Valueing the share **now** also implies predicting its **future** value.


Yeah, if. And even if they hold their network percentage, it will take 3+ years of doing that successfully to justify the current share price. That's a *long* bet to take in the bitcoin mining world, and extremely risky.


Yeah, BFL sucks. We all know that by now. But what you're saying is that "there is exactly one company ... and it continues to be AM". This logic and the valuation of AM shares only make sense if you really believe that, if you believe that AM will be the **only** company that is successful, for **years. YEARS.** If you have that much trust, fine. I think it's pretty naive.


No, I didn't. I sold them all at 3.4, two days ago. If you read where I stated that I sold them for 2, you should have also read that I bought back in at 2.5. So what I missed is the difference of 0.5, and I can live with that. 
And I'm not betting against friedcat per se. What **you** are doing is betting against **everyone** else in the world building up some competition. Me selling my shares and advising others to do the same doesn't have anything to do with an aversion against AM, it has to do with observing the bubble behaviour that is currently taking place, and how people throw away logic and math out of pure greed.

If you're not thinking in binary, it's better to not think about it as being about "leading zeros". The hash is a (huge) number. That number needs to be lower than a specific value (the target). And since that number gets lower and lower, it just happens that there are more leading zeros ;)

- get a bitstamp account
- buy your coins
- create a safe paper wallet on a safe computer (to be really safe, from a live linux cd/flash drive)
- print enough backups of that paper wallet, put another backup on a flash drive that you're not using anywhere else
- transfer the majority of your coins from bitstamp to that paper wallet
- wait and watch them increase in value
- keep a smaller amount of coins online on blockchain.info or on your computer, so you can spend them, invest them or even gamble with them
To be really sure what you're doing, practice all of this first with a smaller amount, including redeeming your private key from the paper wallet and selling your coins again. You'll feel much safer if you completely understand the process.
It's really not that hard, but just do yourself the favour and invest a few hours into getting comfortable with it.

No... what..? Say I initially bought those coins for $10/coin. They increased in value over time, until I decided to buy the nexus. At that time, the exchange rate is $100/coin. By buying them again at that rate, I'm paying for the nexus exactly $165, like if I payed with fiat. And I still have my 1.65 coins from the beginning, which I bought at $10. Their value is going to keep increasing over time. If I ever spend them without re-purchasing them immediately, they will be worth much more than they were before.

Has no one suggested the most obvious explanation? It's unlikely you're the victim of an exploit - as others have already said, in that case, nothing would happen with the file upload dialog. The most obvious explanation is that someone else went to your computer and manually uploaded your wallet. Or had remote access via VNC or similar that made him actually click through dialogs.
If you can't 100% rule out that **anyone** had physical access to your machine, then that's your explanation. If you know who could have had access, then now you know with some certainty that you can not trust this person.

First of all, he owns bitcoins personally. Second of all, there's really not much of a reason to say that bitcoin is a future competitor of Paypal. For parts of it, maybe. But Paypal's model is more escrow'esque, and that can completely work together with bitcoin. And even more than that, it could reduce a lot of the friction that Paypal gets from the traditional banking system. I think they would love nothing more than to enable people all around the globe to pay each other, without going through exchanging all the local currencies for huge fees. 
And third, not everyone is a completely profit-driven piece of shit. You can be sure that David Marcus is pretty much set financially - for the rest of his life. That gives him the freedom to support stuff that actually makes sense and is *good* for the world. I've seen him in a few interviews, and honestly, he just strikes me as a pretty decent guy.

I agree when talking about short term movements.
But a bubble is a pattern that plays out pretty much the same way every single time. The only difficulty is guessing where the peak of the bubble is, and where the floor is after the bubble. That's why it takes the market usually a good amount of time to figure that floor out.

The point is that the buyer can't "scam" the seller. The buyer can't keep the money AND the product. He doesn't have any incentive NOT to send the key. All he could do is be an ass and effectively destroy the bitcoins by not sending the key. If he doesn't send the key, neither of the two sides can access the key and the bitcoins are stuck in limbo forever.

Only if you don't have the bitcoins yet and need to buy them first specifically to make a purchase. Initially setting up a paypal account and loading it up with money/connecting it to your credit card or bank account also takes effort. Arguably it is more complicated to get bitcoins today than it is setting up a PP account, but once you have it set up, I find Bitcoin just as easy, if not easier to use. Especially if you're using off-chain transactions like [inputs.io]( offers. You just enter the username or email address of someone else and make instant payments. It's basically everything that paypal offers, only that it's also bitcoin.
And PP is more **expensive**, which is the main argument for why bitcoin is better. And even if you or many normal consumers might not care, it's also the fact that paying with Paypal involves trusting them, a profit-oriented company, with your payment, and allowing them to take every cent you received away from you again. 
Even if their "customer protection" might feel ok and payments seem easy, wait till you're on the receiving end and sell something, receive payment, give away the product, and then one day later PP announces a chargeback and they just take the money away. *Your* money. Just because someone else couldn't keep his account secure and was "hacked", *YOU* have to pay for them.

Your title reads "Please stop crying over MtGox", and yet you cry over Mt.Gox too.
Anybody who comes from an IT background can understand that the situation they're in isn't so easy to handle. Their customer base has increased so fucking incredibly fast over just the last few **weeks**. 
Nobody saw that coming, they didn't either. They can't just magically make everything appear just because they want it, it has to be developed and implemented, **that takes time**. It's a lot more difficult than just buying a new server and plugging it in, as some of you seem to think when you're blurting out stuff like "they make sooo much money, why they no buy moar sevas!" 
It's a shitty situation, but it's not a reason to condemn Mt.Gox to eternal damnation.

The 52 percent for jewelry fall in the same category as the rest. You don't buy jewelry made of gold because it's useful. You buy it because it's rare and valued.
The 12 percent used for industrial purposes seems too high for me, but I'm too lazy to look it up now. Maybe you're right and I exaggerated a bit there. But again, it's still just a small fraction. And even if it was 50%, it doesn't matter. Fact is that a lot of the value of gold does not come from its industrial use, but its use as money/store of value (which are the same thing).

That is pretty weird to just occur though. They should not just have "more coins than money", since all the money that they'd need give out on withdrawal, has before been send to them by someone else. Plus they should have many million in spare change from all the trade fees. 
If they really are "broke", there must be something much bigger behind it. I just wished they were a bit more fucking open about what is happening. This silence on their part is really devastating for their reputation.

A global, secure ledger of transactions and ownership that works without relying on a third party. Nothing like this has ever existed before. There are a lot of things that are imaginable with bitcoin. 
Independent stock markets for example. And I don't mean that you buy and sell stocks with bitcoin, I mean that Bitcoin *is* the stock market. A company can put 0.01 btc on address, then claim "These 0.01 btc represent 100k shares of our company". Since the blockchain is a completely public ledger, when they send you a fraction of these 0.01 btc, everyone can later see that you got that transaction and therefore undenyably own shares of the company. And you don't need (to pay) a bank or other institution to settle anything for you. That was just spoken really generally - google "colored coins" if you want to learn more about the concept. 
But that is just really the tip of an iceberg... Another cool thing to imagine is autonomous machines or programs. Imagine an intelligent fridge somewhere in a public place that sells snacks for btc. With proper software, it can autonomously work to achieve better profits and serve the demand better. And it owns the money *itself*. It pays people or other machines to refill it, transport it somewhere else if it sees better profit there, etc... The ["internet of things"]( is a fascinating concept, and if you think that's just science fiction, you're wrong. It's happening.
[I also really recommend watching Mike's great talk to get some more ideas](
However you see it, a system like bitcoin will not just disappear. It is *way* too useful for that. And since they are limited, that puts a lot of value onto just a bunch of coins.

Yeah, that might be true. I just spoke out of experience - when I made a transaction there, I saw that the change address was the same address I used to send, so it looked like
address A --------&gt; address B: 0.5 BTC / address A: 49.5 BTC
for example. I still think this should be default behavior in ALL bitcoin clients. The whole change-thing is too difficult for new users, and a lot of btc have been already destroyed due to this.

Comparing it to GPUs that you buy now and comparing the current reward doesn't hold up. By investing in ASICMINER, you are profiting from all their **future** hashrate too. So when difficulty shoots up, your GPUs become worthless, but your AM shares are still profitable because AM deploys more hashing power to stay competitive. You also don't have electricity and other expenses by just holding shares. So it makes sense that the shares are more expensive than if you set up your own mining operation.
But I agree that there will be a massive crash. I sold all my shares already two weeks ago. Apparently, that was too early, the cow still gives milk. But that won't go on forever. The massive dividends we're seeing now are mostly the result of hardware sales. Those dividends are simply not possible by mining alone. When those sales diminish (which they will soon), and the dividend rates drop, many noobs will wake up and then the share price will take a massive hit.

Many do daytrading. I don't, but it's still absolutely exciting to just follow what happens with the market. Especially during explosive times like these.
Say you have 100 btc. Every $ the price goes up is 100$ up for you. That's gives you enough of a rush to be glued to the screen, even though you're not changing a thing.

@_date: 2013-04-24 22:47:29
That's correct. I'm not entirely sure though how the propagation works, so maybe you can enlighten me: Say the merchant is just using any normal wallet, not specifically taking action to be connected to well connected nodes (which is most plausible) and I wanted to attempt that double spend. If I'd propagate the tx going to MY address over a node in say asia, where most of the mining takes place (or probably will in the future), then propagate the tx to the merchant locally, isn't it very likely that one will reach him first, but less likely to be taken into a block?

@_date: 2013-11-11 08:31:21


His objections are perfectly valid. First, he mentions a "fill-up memory denail of service attack". When you send a transaction, and it isn't mined yet, it sits in what's called the mempool, the network's short-term memory if you want. If you can send transactions and delay them with nLockTime, you can basically tell miners they have to keep your transactions in the mempool forever, which allows to fill up the memory with transactions.
The other thing Gavin mentions is that after a while, you can double-spend the timelocked transaction. That is because you initally only broadcast the transaction once to the network. Many miners receive it and hold it in their mempool, but don't put it in a block yet, since the locktime forbids it. Time passes, the transaction still can't be put in a block. Now new miners join the network - they don't know about this transaction, they only get new ones to mine. Also miners who are restarting and clearing their memory are forgetting about the locked transactions. That means that after enough time, there are enough miners in the network that will take another transaction you send, spending the coins that you put in the time-lock before, simply because they don't know that they are locked.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:12:01
None of that matters. Increasing efficiency of miners doesn't reduce the total energy amount that will be used by bitcoin.

You said you'd need to give someone else access to your wallet, which you don't. And that's the same thing.




Yes, exactly.


Yes, there is. You have added security by needing a 2-factor authorization. Someone who accesses/keylogs/whatevers your computer can't spend your coins. Someone who does that can't get to your 2-factor keys if you have them on independent computers and backed up physically somewhere offline. That's added security, period. And a lot of it. Someone trying to circumvent this needs to get access to at least 2 completely independent systems, instead of just one.
Just to be clear: You're actually saying that 2-factor authentication adds no security, and all the people using Google Authenticator and such are just fucking morons who are wasting their time?

The source code is completely open and understood and checked and improved upon by hundreds of people. There's no "backdoor" in it.


We can know that he couldn't just "put" a few million coins in his wallet, because the way bitcoin works just doesn't allow that. But we can't know how much he *mined* fairly. Not only that, we **know** that Satoshi mined hundreds of thousands of coins in the beginning. If he still owns them, he's by far the richest man in all of bitcoin land. But well, that's what he gets for creating this masterpiece. And another thing to consider: there are some addresses thought to belong to satoshi, and they are all watched by the general public. Currently, the coins are just sitting there. If they would move (e.g. he would sell them), he would risk exposing his identity, something which he really, really doesn't want to do.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:33:25
In that example, it would indeed have a large impact. But we're talking here about enabling re-mining of coins that are *not* in use, that are already effectively destroyed by being kept in unaccessible wallets. The plan in your example could still be done with that, you'd just have to move your 10.5 million btc to another address from time to time. The scenario is a possibility (though unlikely), nothing about a rule that re-mines unused coins would change that.

OK i'm not an expert on namecoin and I haven't even tried it out, but here's my basic grasp:
Namecoin is another coin, like bitcoin. But aside from the usual transaction stuff, it has additional commands that allows you to register domains by paying with namecoin (0.01 NC per name). See [here]( 
Those domains end with .bit. You can't access those if you don't have a software installed handling the DNS matching for you - just like there are .onion domains in the tor network.
The good thing about this is that like bitcoin, the whole thing is decentralized, and NO ONE can seize or control any domains directly. Another good thing is that it's based on bitcoin in such a similar way that miners can actually mine namecoin and bitcoin at the same time. In fact, most miners do this.
If someone thinks I'm uttering uninformed nonsense, please correct me, this is really not something I have spent much time on.

This is simply not true. ASICminer earns bitcoin, not fiat. Only their expenses are in fiat. If bitcoin grows in price, that means their expenses relative to btc-value will shrink.

Yes, I know that. But "not paying their miners" looks publicly just like "they haven't found any blocks"
It's all explained by "Damn, we're having some really bad luck today."  
No one could really prove that they are orphaning blocks on purpose.
I appreciate the math btw.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:29:02
1. That requires them to be faster in creating those 6 blocks than the rest of the network. What you're describing is basically a 51% attack. 
So that is what stops someone - he'd need &gt;50% of the networks hashing power (and that only for it to be *more likely* to succeed than not to succeed, it's not guaranteed). 
Arguably, someone who had that would be far better off just mining and getting all the bitcoins for that than too try to attempt a double spend.
2. What you mean by "mining for private keys", is basically generating random private keys and looking if there's any BTC on it. You can't "reverse calculate" from a specific bitcoin address. 
And the chances to succeed in randomly hitting an existing address with BTC on it are small. In fact, they are **so unbelievably astronomically small**, it's just not going to happen. To put it in perspective, see this: 
@_date: 2013-07-25 13:57:10
First of all, there is no "official" wiki.
But yes, *"for increased privacy and as the only way to know what the bitcoins are received for/from"*. 
If you have one address for the donation, then you already know "what the bitcoins are received for".
~~If you take the coins with one donation address, "privacy" is irrelevant since the address is clearly connected to your website/project/whatever. You don't create additional privacy by making new addresses for each transaction, you only create hassle for yourself.~~ &lt;- this is wrong, had it backwards for a second there. Yes, you create more privacy for yourself for example in the way that nobody can see how much donations you have already gotten. But especially in the case of donations, I'd say that the transparancy you give by using one public address is the better practice.
It is good practice to create individual addresses for each **purpose**, so you can seperate unrelated transactions from each other. And if you like managing a buttload of addresses, of course you can create a new address for every single little transaction. But that is neither advisable nor necessary. It really depends on the use case.

No they don't and they didn't say that. Show me friedcat's post where he said that. Or don't even bother trying because I know it never happened. It's word of mouth based on a supposedly "leaked" presentation, and it never was "they have it ready to roll out". That's your own baseless assumption stuffed on already baseless speculation. See what happens with word of mouth? 
If anything, they are merely planning to have 1 PH/s as their highest possible deployment. They were planning to have &gt;200 TH/s by June, how did that work out? They are at ~30TH/s now, after setting it up for half a year, but SURE, give it a few more months and they have 33 times that much. It's not like that stuff needs space or a whole fucking infrastructure to run.
And it doesn't matter anyway, because nothing about that changes any of my points. Even if they get to 1 PH/s, that would mean they would spend a lot more for keeping this huge project up -&gt; Profitability down. Yes, they could end up staying the strongest mining company for the foreseeable future. But they will never keep up the rate of profit that they have made until now. It's just not possible.

They designed and built their own. Avalon actually uses a better chip design IIRC. ASICMINER produced 130nm chips which some would call "antique", but it was a very smart decision. They knew that this simple yet rather inefficient design would allow them to easily get everything ready fast and in mass. And in this business, **time is key**. It doesnt matter much if your miner isn't perfect, if nobody else has any. Now they have made a TON of money and can easily go for 2nd generation chips, while the competition still struggles to get theirs ready.

My point is that I think this ruling doesn't make a lot of sense. You can either say "Only fiat money is money, because the state says so." Or you can say "*Everything* is money." If enough people started exchanging empty soda cans, wouldn't a judge at some point rule "OK, I guess soda cans are money"?

Nice bullshit. "It's a good thing, really! Buy buy buy!"
This isn't good, it destroyed a big chunk of the bitcoin economy. The (by far) biggest marketplace where bitcoins were actually used to purchase goods is now gone. It's still a reality that bitcoin is used rarely to purchase TV's, or groceries, or whatever. But drugs - that was what you bought with bitcoins.
It will (hopefully) not matter in the end, when confidence in bitcoin and its stability is good enough that people actually use it, but right now, it's a huge kick in the balls for us. Please don't paint it as something good, it isn't.

When you send a transaction, and it isn't mined yet, it sits in what's called the mempool, the network's short-term memory if you want. If you can send transactions and delay them with nLockTime, you can basically tell miners they have to keep your transactions in the mempool forever, which allows to fill up the memory with transactions.

AFAIK, it was because you could download the wallet from blockchain.info just by knowing the identifier of a user (basically his username). The wallet that was downloaded was still encrypted though. 
Hackers did this for common identifiers and downloaded a ton of wallets, then bruteforced them offline. It's much, much easier to crack a password offline, because you can use your full resources without anyone stopping you. If you were to try and bruteforce the web login, you'd be slowed down A LOT by internet connection, and your IP would just get banned after a few attempts. So this was kind of a weak point. BUT the real problem here is, as it is so often, people still using damn weak passwords for important stuff. If your wallet is encrypted with a good, 20+ character password, NO WAY they are going to crack it within your lifetime, offline or not.
Blockchain.info added an email verification after this, so if someone wanted to login (download your encrypted wallet), he'd have to have access to your email too.

Well, I think it would be wrong to call it a flaw in ECDSA itself. ECDSA requires a **random** number to sign. If it didn't need to be random, they wouldn't need it at all, they could just take any number. The fact that it needs to be random already illustrates that it also must be unique, otherwise again, why would it need to be random?
With the blockchain, you have a database where every previous transaction is recorded, so collisions of this random number can be detected, even if their creation happens years apart from each other.
I have to say, I don't know **how** random this number is in bitcoin, i.e. what range of numbers it covers. It is only a problem if the range is too small. You have to remember that bitcoin's whole security is based on randomness, and the fact that for example, collisions between private key creations are so astronomically unlikely, that the risk can be safely ignored. If the same is true for **this** random number, there shouldn't be a problem. It's only a problem then with a broken RNG, like it seems to be the case with the android wallets.

This has nothing to do with "a stable measure of value". 
This is about a machine that prints money in a specific currency. If you're evaluating if that machine is worth buying (or in hindsight, if it was a good buy), the currency to calculate profitability in, is the currency that the machine prints.
If the machine prints Euros, but you can only pay for it in Dollars, it only makes sense to look at the time of purchase "how many Euros can I already just buy for the Dollars?" and then estimating at how many Euros the machine will print in its lifetime. If it prints less than what you can get for the Dollars already, you just exchange your Dollars for Euros, without going through the unnecessary trouble of running a money printer.
Come on, I find this really so obvious. Say the Dollar/Euro rate was 1:1. If I were to propose to you to sell you my printing machine. You'd know it could only print 1000 Euros during its lifetime. And I would want to sell it to you for 2000 Dollars. You would flip me off and call me a scammer. And **not** think "yeah but maybe in a year the Dollar/Euro rate will be 3:1!". 
It's just completely fallacious logic and I can just assume it's a sort of psychological measure people take to assure themselves that their bad past decision actually turned out fine.

I'd say that's **why** the work is being done, but not **what** the work does. Like I said, semantics :)
Anyway, what you're describing is the general behaviour of a blockchain. Like I said in the earlier post, that's not what I'm on about. I'm talking about the proof-of-work-concept, which is not directly connected to the blockchain-concept. You could have a different way of realizing proof-of-work, and still put a hash on the contents of the valid-proven block into the next one, thus building a chain. That concept completely stays. What would change would be the way to initially prove the validity of a block, the requirement would then be a little more complex than "is the hash lower than x?"

Couldn't agree more. I'm downvoting every single price related post.
About the whole contract thing... I was wondering if nobody even knew this existed, as it's not used today at all. It's another fascinating concept of bitcoin in my opinion, and the sooner we have implementations for this, the better. Again the link, cause I suggest everyone familiarizes themselves with it: 
Here's something I don't understand though: You can delay payments using nLockTime, providing a timestamp of when the transaction is due. But how is that handled in the blockchain exactly..? When are those transactions taken into a block and so on? Wouldn't it be possible for an attacker to spam the Blockchain with large transactions with a very high nLockTime, so they get dragged on and on over time, but never really executed?

No, well basically, you're right. But that's true for *every* gambling strategy... 
For martingale, there are pretty small odds for long losing streaks, so if you're not planning on doing it again and again and again, until you eventually lose, you actually have a very high chance of winning small amounts. 
The main thing that prohibits martingale systems from working on small scale in casinos is just the low gap between limits on bets. If you have $1 minimal bet, and $50 max, there isn't much room for doubling before it's over. That's why I thought I could give it a shot or two on satoshidice, there it is min 0.01, max 500.

So in the end, coinbase knows and verifies the same information - your name and your address. I don't know why you see a difference in scanning a document that you can even black out things you want to keep secret. It's just to verify your ID and address. Which is exactly what coinbase gets to know too. Only that it is faster to scan a document than to verify a bank account.

No, you're **way** exaggerating here. To double the time a confirmation takes, an attacker in your example would need to turn off 50% of the existing hashing power. And again, that just to *double* the confirmation time to a still acceptable 20 mins... If someone had the hashing power to noticeably  increase the conf.time this way, that wouldn't be his attack vector, because then he could just easily pull a 51% attack...

You should have grasped it from all the responses already, but again: the chances are so astronomically unlikely, it *is just not going to happen*. 
There is real chance, that in the next second, a pink elefant manifests itself in front of you, due to quantum fluctuations. There's also an even higher chance that a big rock manifests itself in the same way above you at night and kills you in your sleep. Should you be afraid for your life now? No. Because just as making a bitcoin address collision, these scenarios are so fucking unlikely, they are just not going to happen.

I sense a litecoin fanboy. So if we were all to use graphic cards, you think it would just stay profitable for everyone? You think the difficulty wouldn't just rise exactly the same way, because EVERYONE was doing it? You think that the mining business wouldn't be taken over by people in countries with low electricity and hardware costs (like china)?
It would just shift the problem and you and the whole litecoin community would still be going "dey took urrrr jaaawbbs". Not even to say how ridiculous it is to ask for a government to ban ASICs.
You are right though in that it is a damn shame that bitcoin and most of the other cryptocurrencies (including litecoin) are based on such a huge waste of energy.

Everyone here will be fast to tell you about low fees etc. Fact is, you will probably make pretty much no sales at all, so that really doesn't matter currently. Right now, you don't have much to gain directly.
Still, there is basically no reason **not** to accept it, so you can just accept it. You don't have to pay anyone to accept bitcoins, you just say you accept them and there you go. If there happens to be a bitcoiner coming across your business and seeing a "Bitcoin Accepted!" message, he will gladly do business with you.
I wouldn't expect much because of it, you will probably make few to no sales with it at the moment. But it's a way to set a sign, if you believe in the value and future of bitcoin.

Hardly anyone will even try to do a double spend with 0 confirmations, but you should know that there is a huge difference between 0 and 1 confs. Much more so than between 1 and 2. 0 means it has only been passed on through the network, but not taken into a block (= it has not been written permanently into the blockchain).

Again, have you calculated ANY of this? Your estimations are just *insanely* unrealistic speculation. 
20x in 30 days? So in 30 days, we'll go from 0.07 PH/s to 1.4 PH/s?? That would mean over 20000 of those 65GH/s miners being deployed. So far, Avalon sold about 1000. And those are still in production. So even if they'd deliver all of them *right now*, the difficulty would at max double.
I'm not justifying the cost of the hardware based on current difficulties, but I and many others can actually estimate where the difficulty is going, and that is *maybe* 1 PH/s at the end of the year. Maybe higher, but it's a long way to go there. It certainly won't happen in the next month. The people who have/get an ASIC **now**, still make a killing.

Make sure you're on a safe computer. Then go to: 
Click the "Paper Wallet" Tab and print out as many as you like. On the paper wallet, there is always a Bitcoin address and the corresponding private key to that address. That private key is what you need to keep secret. When you have coins that you bought on Bitstamp, you just send them to one of the bitcoin addresses on your paper wallet.
You can also additionally encrypt your private key with a password. That's the "BIP38 Encrypt?" option the site gives you. So that even if someone finds your paper wallet and knows what to do with it, he can't access your coins. If you use that option, be sure you *never ever* forget the password you used. But don't write it down on the paper wallet or something, that just makes it pointless...
Again, when you do it the first time, just do it with a smaller amount. When you have send the coins to the paper wallet, check with  that the coins have actually arrived (just enter your bitcoin address in the search field). Then do it again with the full amount.

They don't actually "behave" differently than regular shares at all. If you sell them, you get what someone else is willing to pay at the exchange. There's just one thing to consider if you're deciding between regular and PT shares: If you have regular shares, you get payed by friedcat directly to your bitcoin address. That means:
- you're taking the exchange website (btct, bitfunder...) out of the equation, so if it goes down, hacked or whatever, you don't have to panic
- you're taking the provider of the passthrough out of the equation. There's very low risk that the trusted members providing these PTs are scammers, but they could theoretically just take your bitcoin and disappear.
The downside of regular shares is that they are more difficult to exchange. Having a service like [bitfunder]( doing that is way more comfortable and natural. I only own PT shares and I have not had a problem so far and I don't think there will be one.

I've had the same thought about you. 
n-of-m multisig wallets are the **method** used to enable 2FA. If you think that 2FA adds security, then **THERE YOU GO.**


Just because you keep copies of the keys doesn't mean it is the same as a 1-of-1 wallet! You back those keys up, offline, non-accessable to anyone, only for you, and only in case your 2FA provider goes down. 
OK here are 2 cases:
1. I have a standard 1-of-1 wallet just on my computer.
2. I have a 2-of-2 wallet. I need my computer + a second completely independent party. I have the key of the second party backed up safely, in case it disappears.
You are saying that the second offers no additional security over the first. That is obviously wrong. The second case *only* becomes the first **IF** the "trusted" party turns out evil or gets hacked. You're gaining a lot of security by limiting the possible attackers for your wallet to the people running the "trusted" party, or people that hack the trusted party. But either way to look at it, if they become evil or compromised, they STILL have to hack your computer to do anything. With a 1-of-1 wallet, that step alone would be all. And there you have the added security. I really don't fucking understand how you are even trying to debate that.

For all intents and purposes, yes.








Yes, basically, except that in 2. it's not directly redirect to their online banking. They are redirected to a page hosted by giropay, which incorporates the users online banking. So you log into your online banking via giropay. They need to work together with the bank to allow this, so it doesn't automatically work with every bank. But it works for most.
Another service that does basically the same is [Sofort-Überweisung]( you should check them out too. I believe they're the biggest service doing this and support pretty much all banks in Germany. And I think they're also quite international by now.

That's actually more of a counter-point I think.
This way, the tourists always bring more money *into* the country than *out of* the country.
Anyway, the beauty of it is that it's a self-regulating system. If more bitcoins come into the country, the price for bitcoins in that country would fall, creating incentive for people to buy it cheap and move it out of the country again to sell for profit.
If you have a free market, these sort of problems solve themselves.

I know this would probably suck and lose you money, but if you really need it, you can always easily cancel your withdrawal, buy bitcoins and move them to another exchange. Just write a support ticket when you're logged in and it gets cancelled within a few hours.

@_date: 2013-04-22 16:18:22
Yes, you can only buy a coin if someone is willing to sell you one for that price, and vice versa. The exchanges don't sell coins to you, they just mediate between buyers/sellers.
If at an exchange, you have a highest "bid" of 100$/BTC and a lowest "ask" of 101$/BTC, it means someone wants to pay 100$ and someone else wants to receive 101$. At this point, no trade happens. Both sides just wait for the other side to change their opinion, or for another buyer/seller to arrive at the market and accept the price.

3 . If you look at the transaction OP provided, this is not a change issue. It was a direct transaction of the whole amount.

Everything I say is just my estimation. I'm not all-knowing of course. Just to *me*, it is the obvious way this will play out.
And what value I think is "appropriate" is also just by my estimation, but  I think you can definitely estimate how much Bitcoin should *at least* be worth **if** it survives. Bitcoin is very comparable to gold, with some added benefits. Now look up how much gold is out there in the world, and what value it has arrived at. Compare that to how much bitcoins are out there. Just to give you a rough estimate of the potential.


I disagree and say these people will be very happy with their investment, if they don't panic like chicken when a crash comes. And I would bet money on this with you, except that I'm already doing that by betting on bitcoin. When a crash comes, you'll probably be one of the people going "aaah yeah I knew it, there's that". But you're wrong, just as the people thinking the same when Bitcoin crashed at $30, or $260. Just try to remember this and check again in 2 years if these people who bought at $1000 made a bad investment.
$1000 is nothing.

Yeah but how fucking backwards is it then that the support actually advised me to do the opposite? They are telling me to cancel my already pending withdrawal and make an **even bigger** one! And the only reason for that being that then they win another month or so of me waiting for my withdrawal like an idiot, before I start asking questions again.
Also, and that is important: You lose money on those small withdrawals. Every withdrawal takes a 1% fee, **with a minimum of 5 PLN (about $1.6)**. So you only start to receive the full amount when making withdrawals of $160 or higher. Lower than that, and they are ripping you off on fees too (as if they weren't doing that enough already).

This is not an ASICMINER thread, it's a thread about asic mining and its limits in general.

By running the standard client, you are downloading and holding the entire blockchain (currently about 9GB), which contains the complete bitcoin history - every transaction ever made. If you can spare the space, that's a good thing, but if you don't plan on running the client that often, it's better to either use an online wallet like [blockchain.info]( or run a client with simplified verification like [electrum]( 
I suggest you just use blockchain.info for starters, it's the easiest to use IMO. If you get some bigger holdings, it's wise though to put the biggest part of your stash in cold storage (offline), for example as a [paper wallet](

I covered that in my other response to you sufficiently. You can have any  n of m transactions you want. So you can rely just on that 1 of 100 servers using the protocol is online.

@_date: 2013-04-08 03:50:00
This type of logic is so obviously flawed that I don't get how some people actually believe it...
So the bitcoins are going to be worthless because they will be worth so much? Bogus. Whenever the price is not rising, there's incentive to spend/sell them. The market corrects itself, that's the magic of it.
And never spending them equals to never spending anything. Imagine if bitcoin is the only currency, will people not buy food, clothing or whatever they need? Of course they will. Do you buy a computer, even though I can tell you for **sure** it will cost half in a year? Isn't it obvious that the logical thing for you to do is **never** buy one then? No, that's not how people work. We have desires that we want fulfilled. Now.
If you're thinking, "yeah but there's other currencies, they can just keep the bitcoin as investment and buy the other stuff with fiat" - that's exactly where the logic is flawed. Why wouldn't those people then just convert all their money to bitcoin anyway? Its value is going up, so why even keep the fiat to buy other stuff? It would be stupid, they'd be losing out on the gain. What I'm saying is, for the sake of logic, you can just treat it as the only currency, because it doesn't make any difference. And if it's the only currency, people would obviously still want stuff.
Also consider this: I just bought a Nexus 7 Tablet today with bitcoin. I paid 1.65 btc. Right when I bought it, I bought 1.65 bitcoin back at the current exchange rate. This isn't affecting my investment in bitcoin at all now. I bought a cheap tablet and I still have my investment.

@_date: 2013-06-04 03:45:46
No, scamming doesn't mean that there will never be a product. Is that really your definition of a scam? Wikipedia says it's "an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence." And that is exactly what they did! 
They lied deliberately, they were **NOT** being "overly optimistic". Assuming that alone shows a kind of delusion that is unbelievable to me. At the point of time when they said they'd be delivering product, they hadn't even hired an engineer to even start up the fucking project. And then they drag it out for month after month, all the while saying that it's ready in two weeks. Do you really think they can't seperate "two weeks" from "8 months"? Woopsie, we miscalculated?
They have millions of dollars in preorders, do you understand how much interest alone they made out of that profit? It doesn't matter shit if they start shipping now - which they are hardly by the way, they are giving out the little 5GH/s thingies at the moving pace of a clinically dead turtle, and no one has ever seen any of the other devices.

Good idea, but you're giving false information.


That's incorrect, and you're basically implying that a wallet is the SAME as a bitcoin address. 
A wallet is nothing else but a bunch of keys to a bunch of bitcoin addresses, not ONE address. It's also misleading to say that a wallet holds your bitcoins, a wallet merely gives access to your bitcoins, they are always "held" in the network. That is important for newbies to understand. If they think their bitcoins are IN that wallet file, why can't they just copy that wallet file and have doubled the bitcoins?

OK, we all know that selling for Paypal is generally a bad idea, it was foolish you even tried blablabla. 
But here's an idea for a boring day: Create an ebay honeypot. Claim to sell bitcoins on ebay, get paypal money, then tell them that you need to wait a week before sending the coins, to make sure it wasn't a hacked account. After that, you can make them jump through some more hoops, like sending you a timestamped scan of their ID with a piece of paper that says "I, x x, bought x from x". Chances are you will get very few sales that don't get chargebacked (hacked accounts), and probably zero sales after asking for ID verification (the ones that do it with their own account). You won't make a sale, but you will make some scammers lose a bunch of hacked PP accounts, costing them money&amp;time.

I don't see why the first would be necessary. The ~21 million total amount is completely arbitrary anyway, it could have been 50 million, or 1 million, doesn't matter. The only important thing is that the amount is limited. "Recreating" lost coins thus seems pointless, and like you're suggesting, kind of unfair, because it favours miners.
I agree on the second point though. While the total amount is supposed to be limited, it is also supposed to be infinitely divisible. "1 Satoshi" thus probably won't be the smallest denomination forever.

You mentioned ASICMINER saying that they'll deploy 800-1000 TH within this year, and go on saying that that's close to your prediction of 700-1200 TH total hashrate this year. What you seem to overlook is that ASICMINER will try to stay at around 25% of the network, not make up the whole network. So when they're expecting to deploy 1000 TH, the hashrate of the total network would be 4000 TH. Which would be **insane**.

Well, doing it manually, you can go to blockchain.info and check the time when the block with new difficulty was mined. Difficulty changes every 2016 blocks, so you can just subtract 2016 from the block number to get the one for the last change. The current difficulty change occured on [block 254016]( The one before that on [block 252000]( and so on.

It's in the nature of bitcoin that there have to be people who own the entire blockchain, otherwise nobody could be sure that transactions are valid. If I send you a bitcoin, you can only be certain that I *really* send you one because a program checks through the entire blockchain that the input I used to make that transaction wasn't already spent earlier.
So in general, people having the entire blockchain are important. But there are already a lot of them, so if your question is what your direct benefit is: just that you're supporting the bitcoin network and the coolness factor of knowing that you have the entire transaction history of bitcoin on your computer.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:20:51


That is what I mean. That just means that you will not be able to publish any blocks you have mined if someone else mines in the meantime.
What you're saying is just shifting the same thing. You'd still lose out on every block reward if someone else mines faster.
edit: to be clear, an example: 
 - Miner A mines 1st block, keeps it secret
 - Miner A mines 2nd block, keeps it secret
 - Miner B mines a block, publishes it
 - Miner A now publishes his 2 blocks
That is what you're suggesting? That would work, yes. But there is this scenario which would occur *all the time* while trying this
 - Miner A mines 1st block, keeps it secret
 - Miner B mines a block, publishes it
 - Miner A **can't** publish any block now, loses out on the reward

Feel free to do that, but you can actually deduct that easily yourself.
Think about it: if you double the hashrate in the network, blocks are found twice as often = half confirmation time =&gt; double difficulty, so blocks are found twice less often. 
It's just proportional.

OK. Then come the problems with implementing this new network: You obviously want it to be decentralized. How is the work spread to the workers? Researcher Bob says "I have this and that research to be done.". He propagates it through the network, some workers pick it up and do the work. Getting this alone to work safely is quite a job. Then somebody says, "I'm finished" and sends a result back. How would the researcher know that it's a valid result, not something that someone made up just to get the reward? And how to make sure that the result reaches Bob without someone on the way through the network just taking the result and saying it's **his** result? I don't see how you could do the validation in this szenario... With Bitcoin, it's easy to validate, you just do one hash and you know a Block someone found is valid. That's not possible here, since you're not just doing millions of hashes, and then one hash is the right hash, like in a lottery. You're doing actual calculations, and validation of the result would mean doing the same calculations again.
Correct me if I'm wrong please. I don't want to step on your dreams, but I think what you're picturing is a **very** difficult task and pulling it off would require the kind of genius system that Satoshi came up with in creating Bitcoin...
I think a centralized approach to this would be far easier. But not easy. It all comes down to how you want to validate the result of the research done. Not only does the money depend on this, in this case, it's actual human lives.

I think we're fighting over semantics here. The network reaches consensus by having the proof of work as a **proof of work**, nothing else. The work IS just busywork. That's why there's no difference to the functioning of the system if SHA or scrypt or any other hashing algorithm is used. It's only the method used to make sure that to fake the transaction history, somebody would need to repeat the work that has already been done. That's the whole purpose of the proof of work in bitcoin. Are you actually denying that?


I can't, and I haven't said that I could, I'm saying that maybe, in the future, someone else will. I'm saying that I don't think something like that is impossible. Just because you can't imagine a system in which consensus is reached without using **anything else** but a simple hashing function, doesn't mean it can't exist. And I never said it can't **involve** finding a difficutl hash value.
Say you need to find the right protein for a purpose, or the right folding of a protein, and we'd know how we want the result to look. A miner would need to try every folding composition incrementally (like bitcoin's nonce) and once he finds the right solution, he could publish the "nonce" and everyone on the network could immediately check for the result.
And maybe a new system would still contain a hashing algorithm. It could work with doing what I said above, AND doing what bitcoin already does now. So you'd need two solutions. All that would do is increase difficulty, but that wouldn't make any difference in the big picture. Or there could be a complex system, using a mix of solving real problems and hashing the input/result, reaching consensus by a majority of honest nodes agreeing on the solution to the problem... something like that, but who knows.
If you disagree on the possibility of that, fine. But stop saying that the hashing done isn't busywork. It is. It serves a purpose by being busywork, but that's it.

@_date: 2013-07-23 08:27:49
The number i explained in my previous post is the **target**. That's the number that gets lower and lower with time, and miners try to "get under it". **Difficulty** on the other hand is calculated as 
difficulty = maximum_possible_target / current_target
So this number goes up as the current_target goes down. Since this calculation is a division, you get a decimal part. Maybe also worth noting that the "maximum_possible_target" is the target with which bitcoin started. You can conclude from that that the starting difficulty was 1.

I for one definitely **do** care a lot about the political and economic implications of bitcoin, and I know many, probably most here do too. Of course we are happy when bitcoin rises in value, but just because there is a lot of noise when it rises, doesn't mean we don't stand behind the fundamentals. 
It's part of the ingenuinity of bitcoin that it gives a financial incentive while at the same time changing the world for the better.


That is a problem that I believe will generally even itself out over time. Of course there will be people who won't sell their coins at any price, and yes, they might become very wealthy due to this. But I'm not sure why this is such a big problem. It's not unfair in any way, they were just early and had strong hands in holding their coins, something which isn't easy for most people. 
If you have something with value, there will be people who have much of it - that's just how the world works. Bitcoin was never about "getting rid of the 1%" or something like that.


Bitcoin really isn't about "destroying ruling classes" or anything like this - my guess is that won't go away for a long time. It's about establishing a new financial system that is based on **sound money**, money that is limited and not created by central authorities out of thin air. It has the same attributes as gold has, which made gold a good money for thousands of years, but also has attributes that make it good money in today's digital world. It's basically gold that you can transfer over the globe within seconds. That is a fantastic and useful invention, it's actually the first real "invented money" that mankind has seen, nothing compares to it.

I said it's no different than if the store that sets it up just sells the bitcoins directly. The machine does only function as a middleman in doing exactly that: selling bitcoins from the owner of the machine to you. It doesn't solve the problem with exchanges and the regulatory crap. It only shifts the responsibility to the machine owner. That person still has to buy the coins off an exchange.
Again: it solves only a problem that doesn't exist. If there were store owners that wanted to sell bitcoin, they wouldn't be starting doing that by buying a machine for it - they would just start selling them normally. Then, when demand really is high enough that it starts to make sense to deploy a vending machine for it, then only will that machine have a purpose. The simple fact that this is not the case - there are not myriads of "Bitcoin Shops" popping up - says enough about the demand for such a machine. All the regulation crap that someone running such a shop would have to put up with, doesn't just go away because you run the shop through a machine...

I clearly mentioned the risk. Contrary to the AM cheering crowd, I'd never go as far and call Coinlenders something like "the safest investment you can make". But I'd definitely call it safer than investing in AM now, at a share price of ~4.5. With Coinlenders, the only risk is the person running it being dishonest or going bankrupt. With AM, the risk is the share price itself.
I trust TradeFortress enough to think that it's worth it. He has created good reliable services so far (he also owns [Coinchat]( and [inputs.io]( which I think is a great project, and runs [BTCINVEST]( on bitfunder) and I believe he's not in this to run away with the coins. But then again, you can never really know.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:37:29


Nothing is different. It's really just going the way I and many others expected it to go. I find people around me being surprised about that, but that is just the way it *has to* go, isn't that obvious? People don't jump in because and while Bitcoin manifests itself as a currency. They jump in in wild manias, chasing profits. But that is completely fine. You don't have to ask yourself "what has changed that bitcoin is suddenly worth so much more?". You have to see that bitcoin is worth a lot more, *right from the beginning*, and people are just finding it out over time, which manifests itself in bubbles. And this one won't be the last, I'll tell you that. But Bitcoin's real time comes when all of that slows down, which it inevitably will. We started out with something that was thrown into the world, worth a lot, but valued for nothing. Price discovery for something like that takes time, and that is really all the explanation there is for *why* we are seeing these explosive increases.

Oh god I really hope it crashes soon, so I can buy a lot more on the cheap. Problem is, a lot of people think that. Which is why I don't see it crashing any time soon. 
For it to crash hard, I assume there'd need to be some really bad news, like the hacks in '11. But I'm sure even such bad news wouldn't hurt bitcoin as much as it did back then. It would drop for sure, but it would recover.

1) The brainwallet was the one that comes with your account and is automatically generated for you. Did someone on the inside (blockchain.info) get a hold of the private key?
2) Against all odds and probabilities, someone guessed/computed the private key of this address.
1. I highly, highly doubt it.
2. Definitely not.


I'd say so. Think very carefully, did you ever back up your private keys somewhere? IIRC, blockchain.info sends a backup of your wallet out per email. Are you sure that's safe? 
Was there a login from your IP around the time the transactions were send? I could imagine someone hijacking your browser session from your pc after you logged in yourself.
Do you live alone? I remember from just a while back this guy who had a similar problem and then found out that it was his roommate who took his coins. If you live with someone you don't completely trust and that someone knows that you're into bitcoin, I'd give that the biggest probability. All he has to do is wait for you to take a shower, go to your computer, find a logged in blockchain session and steal your money.

Stocks. "Informed" gambling, if you will. There are a few stock exchanges to look into, namely [btct]( [bitfunder]( and [havelock](
Real gambling is also something you can very easily do with bitcoins. If you like that stuff, there are lots of bitcoin gambling sites. But I'd stay away from that if I were you. I lost about 25 bitcoin in one very painful hour in february, playing [satoshidice]( Not going to make that mistake again.
A more interesting gambling site if you don't want to gamble, but actually invest, is [just-dice]( You can invest bitcoins there, and then you are part of the "bank". People who gamble on the site will gamble against (partly) your investment. And since the bank has a 1% advantage, it nets profit in the long run. You can read more about that when you go to the site and click the "invest" tab. Or in the [bitcointalk-thread](

Well, fair in the way that they took it because it was "criminal money" and are then destroying that criminal money. Fair from the point of view that the arrest was justified in the first place.
I know that what they'll do is common practice. It's usual that law enforcement takes criminal goods and sells them for profit. But I have yet to see any justification for that process. I have recently discussed this a lot with friends and family. Everybody just takes it for granted, like it's the most normal thing in the world - "we say you're criminal, so all that bad criminal money that you made, that is ours now.

Well, if someone would go through the elaborate effort and investment, just to scare users from SR this way, one would have to wonder what his motivations had to be. 
If it was a rivaling site (like Atlantis or BMR), it wouldn't do much good, since it would probably not drive people to *their* sites, only away from the whole idea in general... 
If you're saying it could be done by FBI/DEA or similar, to destroy the business model, think about what you're saying... they would essentially poison/kill innocent people just to make their point, which would only even have an effect if they did it on a big scale.
Basically, yes, someone *could* do that, but what would be their motive? Someone could just as well go into a grocery store and inject poison into chocolate bars. Is that an argument against grocery stores, or chocolate? Or that someone can go into a grocery store more or less anonymously?

When I posted this, I just came from reading [his other stupid thread](
He doesn't really know what he's talking about and keeps claiming his superficial opinions are facts. He keeps talking up everything without applying any critical thinking. Kinda tickles me the wrong way. Just look through this thread... someone says "well you're kinda speculating here, no?" and he goes "Nope. Simple math."... what math?! Jesus.


Maybe a tiny little bit. But I'd say the vast majority is just using the fiat for that that they have outside of bitcoin. If you need to sell bitcoins to pay for your christmas presents ... you're doing something wrong (or at least playing a very dangerous game). I own bitcoins, and am I going to sell some to pay for presents? Are you? I have enough on the bank, nothing about bitcoin has changed, why would I sell?  
So that's why I don't think that argument holds a lot of weight. The main reason why I facepalmed over him saying that is because it's just this grabbing-for-straws thing... if it was january 3rd or something, he'd say "Well, people are still hungover from new year's, so they are not buying much yet. But next week, billions from Wall Street, for sure!"
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:00:57
That is very true. There are for example these [Brainwallets]( where you can create private keys from passphrases that you can memorize. People use this without thinking to much about it and create addresses based on highly insecure phrases. I remember that guy who had 90 BTC on "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". His BTC were gone within 10 minutes.
There are people who have bots running who do nothing else but combine common words and phrases to scan. There was this guy here lately who bragged about making about 500 btc with his brainwallet-bot so far.
But this is a problem of people and their use of insecure passwords/passphrases etc. The security of bitcoin itself is failproof. I am actually not too sure about how the random number generation in the common clients is handled, but if it was weak, I'm sure we'd have heard about that already.

Btc can't stop corruption of course. And neither does it eliminate poverty, or cures cancer. But it can help eliminate arbitrary borders and thus help in decreasing corruption, since the arbitrary borders are only there because someone profits from them. The guy you were replying to described for example that people can't move money out of the country (only up to $10k). This is one example where bitcoin can truly liberate people. And it helps in decreasing corruption since there is a big system of corruption in place for people who already **do** move more than the limits out.

$46000\*15 = **$690,000 per btc**

Useful purpose does not equal useful work.
I'm not talking about the blockchain. The new currency I'm imagining here would also use a blockchain and would thus have "a secure record of transactions". The difference is the proof of work done. In Bitcoin, it is "useless". It's just work that needs to be done to show you have done work. I'm not trying to put that in a negative light, and yes, it serves a useful purpose in the end, but that's just how it is. The work itself is just busywork. If there was a way to have that work be at the same time proof of work and actual useful work, that would be fantastic.
That might even be impossible, but I don't really think it is, at least theoretically. One of the biggest problem I see with it is the keeping a "decentralized" aspect. Who would control what (medical or other) calculations would be done by the network?
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:32:10
I think you're underestimating how many people use it to transfer value, already right now. I have payed many a thing with bitcoin, and while those have been mainly digital things, it has been a very efficient tool for this. It's very easy and yadda yadda, you know the arguments. You're right in that it is mainly a speculation vehicle for many people at the moment, but that doesn't mean it loses any of its usefulness by that. The value of a coin isn't even really that important for its use.

Nobody said bitcoin was a continuous function. Bitcoin generation on the other hand, is. The output halves every 4 years, it's as easy as that.
The only reason why the generation would stop is when it would have to halve 0.00000001 - at this point, in the current implementation, it would go to zero and coin generation would stop, yes. That is because Bitcoin are represented in code as an unsigned int. But that is not final. When we reach that point, I'm pretty sure there will be place for more digits - we'd just use a larger datatype. The only reason it's not implemented like this now is that it will have no use for many, many years. Or at least that is my understanding of it.

I'm not sure what you mean by 20% yield. You mean they get 20% of their investment? That's not enough, if you can't sell the shares back at the same price you bought them. And that's the thing: you will not be able to do so, if you're not selling them soon enough. In the end, you might not find ANY buyer anymore and sit there with a worthless share. You can't assume that you'll be able to sell your shares for the price you bought them in half a year PLUS having the dividends. That's not how this works.
You can think of the AM shares as being a little asic miner you bought yourself. They mine with about 20 TH/s now, so that's 20 TH/400.000 shares = 50 MH per share. 50 MEGAHASH. Those 50 MH/s need to pay for themselves, that's the only valid point of view here. And I can get 50 MH/s WAY cheaper than for 2.5 BTC (~$300!).
Now the people pushing the share will say "but they got like this quazillion of more TH planned for the next month, so blabla". That is a misleading point. **The BTC return is FIXED. You can't magically make more bitcoin appear than are put out by the system, every bitcoin fan should know that.** Even if they deploy 200 TH, they will do that just to keep their share of about 20% of the network. Only the costs for them to do it will rise, there is no increased income by that. And it is even highly unlikely that they will be able to keep a 20% share of the network forever.
The only granted point for a higher share price than about 1 BTC is the hardware sales, which bring in some nice extra profit. But that is also very limited in time. They are going to get a few big sales, yes, but that will soon enough fade, and it is definitely not justifying such an insanely high price for the shares.

And they don't have to. They are using their power to promote Bitcoin and make it more mainstream-accessible. Be a little grateful.

To be honest, it would surprise me if he handed them to the government, but it wouldn't suprise me one bit if he was just secretly mining with it for himself/his friends. It's millions over millions of dollars worth of coins... so we're to expect that he just doesn't do it because he doesn't want to disappoint a few people on the internet?

Look at the "about us" page: 
The "What do our customers think about us?" Graphic looks like it's just a screenshotted copy from another site, it's just a picture, even though it has "Read reviews" which I'd think would be links..
It also says "95% of our customers would buy from Laptops Direct again". Laptops direct is completely different and as far as I can tell, unrelated online shop:

Buying $25 weekly is just fine, and I think a good practice. Better than any savings account. 
Don't listen to the people who tell you here that you *have to* lock away your coins on a paper wallet - the idea is ridiculous. Just practice some good security. Most important: put 2-factor-authentication on everything where you hold more than trivial amounts of coins. Especially coinbase for you. It can not be stressed enough how important 2FA is, it makes it almost impossible for a hacker to get your coins, even if he has all your passwords.
If that is covered, just get into it - the rest will follow. When you get to decent amounts of coins, you'll look on your own how to store them completely safe.

@_date: 2013-10-26 01:38:43
Oh yes it was. You have to realize that was at a time when there weren't even any real exchanges, it was just a small group of guys on a forum. Nobody had any idea if what they had had any value at all and they were mostly just trading it for fun and to test the software (which was still quite buggy). 
They were just numbers in a computer, and 7200 new ones were coming out every day, distributed between few people. So they didn't have much value.
Give me a time machine. God damn it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:53:34
Great explanation, thank you!
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:02:09


Yes, definitely. Don't keep your coins on an exchange, that is very bad practice. Exchange goes down, you're screwed.


Yeah, can't hurt. "Dollar cost averaging" doesn't really work, but you shouldn't buy them all at once at market price alone for the reason that you might pay too much by increasing the price yourself through your buys. Better have a little patience and set some bids to be filled. But still, you should have the process done within a day.


Practice with a smaller amount. It helps if you've done the whole process at least once before you're going big. Other than that... just be careful. If you're moving btc between addresses, make sure you're using the right addresses etc... don't use bitcoin-qt (it's too confusing and counter-intuitive), use Electrum or Multibit. Use a computer that you're sure isn't infected somehow. Use 2-factor-authentication **everywhere**. Stay away from the gambling sites. Be very careful when looking into bitcoin securities. They have been very profitable for me, but man, that shit is crazy.
Other than that... You have to have a strong hand with bitcoin. Don't get scared and sell if it drops a bit in value, thinking "oh my god, I made a huge mistake". Bitcoin has always had huge swings in value, but the general trend has never been anywhere else but up. Always see it as a long term investment and not as something you buy and sell on a daily basis.
Good luck and welcome to the bitcoin universe.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:40:57

That's the first solid answer I read here regarding the energy waste point. If it's true though, that's far from proven. I'd imagine the point where "the cost doesn't justify the reward" can only arrive once development of more efficient hardware stops or at least slows down (which it will. ASICs are the last big step in the forseeable future). Before that, more efficient hardware will lead to a new rush on that hardware - because it is more rewarding - and increasing the total energy used by more than would be "fair". Simply put, if everyone uses CPUs, the people who first use GPUs gain a lot more by using **more energy in GPUs than would be profitable if *everyone* was using GPUs**. Since the new technology is more rewarding, it pays off to "overdo" it. Once everyone catches on and uses GPUs, ASICs come out, and the same thing repeats itself. 
Anyway, eventually, there would still be an equilibrium, but even in the current economy, I wouldn't say that point comes quickly. That leads to the next point: If that equilibrium ever has to come is also debatable. One could argue that as we approach it, bitcoins price would have to rise, since it gets harder and harder to mine. If something is harder to get, it is simply traded at a higher value. And thus a rise of bitcoin price would push that equilibrium further and further away. So if we're imagining that we were at a mining equilibrium now (price of bitcoins ~= price of producing them), if we look at a future where 1 bitcoin is worth 100x what it is worth today, that means that to reach the same equilibrium, the system would use 100x the energy it uses today. The whole thing depends directly on the price.

Yes, with giropay, you log into your online banking "while they're watching" and do the transaction (requiring a TAN). They then confirm to the recipient that you made the payment. That way, the recipient doesn't have to wait for the money to actually show up in his account, so he can for example immediately send you what you bought.
Are you considering implementing GiroPay into QuickBT to offer the service for German users? That would be great!

Exactly. And that is a form of brute force by the way.
Just as a rule of thumb, don't use any phrase that could have been written in any book or by anyone anywhere before. Have it instead, for example, involve your personal name and a little password. A simple sentence, salted with a password, is a pretty good protection. "Hi, my name is John Doe and I was born in 1983. kRwag! Is much much safer than any long sentence you can come up with. Write down the password somewhere and memorize the sentence (it's easy enough). Bruteforcing that won't work (read: will be very very hard) because somebody had to use a dictonary attack to find the sentence + at the same time brute force the password. If somebody finds your written down password, they can't use it either, because they don't know how to apply it, and to what.
Just a general idea, don't do this exactly like I just said, because I just said it openly. But understand the idea.

I'm not a fan of governments myself, but I'm not delusional enough to believe that we will see a dramatic shift within the next years. I strongly believe that at some point in the future, mankind will be able to live without governments, but I don't think I or anyone here will live to see that day. The history of mankind has been a long and hard story of shifting power from the government to the people. We are in a place now where we're as free as people never were before. And I think that development will continue, but it will continue slow and steady. And while bitcoin is a great way to disrupt the financial monopolies of this world, don't be fooled that it will immediately change the direction the world is turning.

If Bob sent 10 BTC from address A to address B, that's saved in the blockchain, and so the networks knows that the BTC are on address B now. Your local bitcoin client uses a wallet. That wallet is nothing else than a bunch of private keys, to access a bunch of addresses.
It's important to understand that nobody is sending bitcoin to your PC. A wallet saved on your PC doesn't mean "Bitcoin stored on your PC". Bitcoin are always "stored" in the network, all that is on your PC is the private key, with which you prove ownership of an address. So if you send a payment through the network, you can sign it with that private key, and the network knows you are allowed to make that payment.
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:11:12


That's not the problem. The system is designed in a way that: high energy use = high security. It doesn't matter if it's CPUs, GPUs, ASICs or Quantum Computers.


You can't compare that. Bitcoin isn't a bank. It's just a transaction layer. In the future there will probably be a "Bitcoin Bank", that one will have a building too ...


1% annually by not being able to move the money at all. That is a terrible deal. It's not supposed to make anybody rich by them just holding onto their coins. If that was the principle, it would be a terrible idea, correct. But it isn't. It's just meant to provide a healthy amount of inflation to the system.

It's an address that you create that starts with the letters or numbers that you want (usually has to start with 1 though). Basically works by the program randomly running through addresses until it finds a match. If you just want the first few letters, it usually works within seconds or minutes, but everything above that takes way longer. For a "1Archive..." address like we have here, my computer would take about 12 hours to have a 50% of finding one. You can actually call this another form of mining. Some people pay for long vanity addresses.

It depends on who solves the next block, creating the longest chain. 
Say block A and B were solved at practically the same time. They get both distributed around the network. Nodes who receive them build on the first one they received for the next block. So there are some miners in the network building on top of block A, and some building on block B. Now if a miner finds the next block, he has the longest valid chain, and whatever block he build on before will become the valid block one, and the other one is orphaned.

This is the moronic monday thread - no question is stupid enough :) And your's really isn't anyway.


Nothing is stopping them from doing that. It's the miner's own decision which transactions he wants to take into a block. Naturally, he'll prefer those with fees. But if there is still room in the block, there isn't much of a reason **not** to take the rest in too.

@_date: 2013-08-10 11:30:55
It pisses me off. I read the title and got excited "What company can that be, what service will they build?" and then of course: "bitcoin mining". 
We don't need funding for a mining company, we got plenty of those coming up, mostly crowdfunded. Funding a mining operation is no problem. And it's not helping bitcoin at all. What we need is funding in companies that develop software, companies that built upon the protocol, or that develop interesting hardware solutions with bitcoin. **Something useful.** Not another fucking mining company that essentially does nothing for bitcoin than trying to gain off its back.
And then they're apparently not even selling miners, but running them all themselves. Really a great way to work against decentralization.

But it will eventually get included. I have yet to hear about a case where a transaction was *never* included, which is what OP was afraid about.
*Days* is really the worst case scenario here, and I have never experienced that myself yet.
For now, paying fees is only if you're concerned with the speed of the transaction going through. If you don't really care if it takes a day, you don't need to include a fee.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:45:26
There aren't any floating numbers in bitcoin (would be a very bad idea too, because of the precision problems you mention). 
Internally, bitcoins are always represented as satoshis in integer form. That means that increasing the "decimal places" for bitcoins doesn't mean increasing the precision on a float value, it means eventually increasing the size of the datatype. Currently, it has to be able to fit ~2100000000000000 satoshi. For every decimal place we decide to add, the capacity has to increase by 10x.

I originally bought 20 shares at 0.7 btc/share, and was quite happy when I sold them all between 1.7 and 2.0.
Of course, now I regret it, and I have bought back in with 10 new shares last week at ~ 2.5 and those again have already turned out to be a good investment. I really think there is nothing better to invest in right now than AM. I'd estimate the true value of the shares to be ~ 5 BTC, we'll see if that price will ever be reached though. Anyway, I'm in it for the long run now. I'm not going to miss these sweet dividends again.

I'm not as optimistic there. The deeper the market is doesn't really matter, since then their coins will be worth a lot more and the power they have over the market will have increased proportionally. If they do it earlier, how much they gain from it will be less, and in absolute value, the market will have to absorb less (if bitcoin keeps increasing in value).
I agree that they will likely not sell it in one huge dump, that would be stupid on their side. But again, that would be the best case. They would gain less and the market would need to absorb less then on a periodic selloff.
We'll see how it plays out, but I'm afraid that it could put a ceiling on btc price for a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:04:16
Uhm, yeah. That just means you learned about people collecting your wallet now. Others probably already have it and are working on cracking your password.
I'd suggest creating a new wallet and moving your funds there. And this goes to everyone.
This step they took is nice and necessary, but it only works as of **now**. There are probably a lot of wallets collected, and while it takes time to break the encryption (a lot of time if your password was safe, little time if it wasn't), it's better to be safe than sorry.

@_date: 2013-03-28 02:13:44
IMO, it **only** depends on the BTC price for now, since the rest can be calculated. And if you don't assume it will crash very hard very soon, it's a bad idea to sell, even for 10k. 
The difficulty will not jump as quickly as you might think, you can easily calculate what 1k 60GH/s miners are going to do. Since Avalon is the only company delivering ASICs for now, that's all there is to increase difficulty.
Current difficulty: 
1000 * 60 GH/s = 60000 GH/s added to the network, which would about double the network's hashing rate. As the difficulty is directly proportional to hashing-rate, it would double also.
Now take the profitability calculator at  and double the difficulty. At current BTC prices, you have the $1500 for your miner payed off in under 10 days. 
Correct me if my math is wrong, but it seems to me that you're throwing away a very good opportunity. I'm kicking myself for not being one of the lucky people to have ordered from Avalon in time.

I think I have heard that one before... no wait, it was just 30 countries with the other one. Jeff Berwick and his "We'll have it on the streets by next week"-machine. Anyone know what happened to that? They had a working model months ago, way before Lamassu.
This thing is only one way. It doesn't give you cash for bitcoins, and thus it's not even an ATM. It's only a Bitcoin ATM in the same way a Coca Cola vending machine is a Coke ATM.
They can not possibly be deployed anywhere on the street, because it's pretty much just a (plastic?) box that anybody could steal. That means you could only have it in a store for example, where the store owner owns it and owns the bitcoins it sells. Just like a vending machine - because that's what it is. And if that is the designated use case, why not just have the store accept cash, push a button on the computer and sell you the coins that way? I just don't see what the need for a machine is that does this, if it can't run without supervision anyway.
There are not even stores that sell bitcoins over the counter, so why make a vending machine that does nothing else..? If there was no store that even sells Coke, would your first idea be "lets make a machine where people can indirectly purchase them from a store owner"?
I think it's a cool technology, but has anyone actually stopped to think how useful it really is?

It went like this basically: a big player wanted to withdraw 1300 btc. Dooglus (the site owner) payed it out, and (very) stupidly forgot to take it out of the balance of the user on the site. The guy, being an asshole, kept playing with the btc he didn't actually have anymore, and lost it all to the system.
At first, dooglus was going to pay the btc out of his own pocket. Which is really kind of noble, because we are talking about fucking 1300 btc here.
But then he realized, correctly, that these 1300 that were lost to the system never actually existed. They were payed out already. He just reversed the losses by the player and everything was fine. Nobody lost any btc except those that were never real to begin with.

Yes, the latecomers will inevitably suffer, unrecoverably, when the value shoots well over what is appropriate. But we're far from anyone being a "latecomer", and far from an appropriate value.


Absolutely correct. People are sheep and they're stupid. No doubt many are jumping in without having the slightest hint of a clue *why* they're actually doing that. I personally know a handful of people for whom that is true. The good thing is that Bitcoin actually *is* a good thing and when people without a clue start seeing nice returns, they will automatically seek information about their investment, learn *why* it's getting so popular and gain confidence over time.


It's really not. This is not a stock, and comparing bitcoin to dotcoms is really comparing apples and oranges. What you're describing is just mania/bubble behaviour in general, and yeah, that's what's happening here... again, that is not surprising, but completely expected. And I don't see many people claiming "the only direction bitcoins price can go is up", and if someone says that, he's obviously full of shit.
And for the thing about people buying Bitcoin who don't have a computer... why is that such a problem to you? Even if they do that and only have their coins on a paper wallet, they still actually *own* the bitcoin. Nobody can take it away from them and it serves its purpose as a store of value just the same way as if they hold it in digital form. I find it way more ridiculous to buy gold on paper for example, because in that case, you actually don't have anything at all.

That is a difficult question. Some people argue that you need a high market cap (= high price) for the price to become stable. 
I personally don't understand the reasoning behind this and don't think the market cap has anything to do with it per se. I think it will only get less volatile with trust and acceptance. That has nothing to do with the price. But the more people agree that 1 bitcoin is worth X$, the more stable it will be around that price. And the more people agree that they're worth something, the higher that price will probably be. So I'd say the stability will lead to a higher price, not the other way around.
@_date: 2013-09-03 18:17:27

I say it again, the topic of discussion here is why it's an advantage for the **merchant**. I agree that they wouldn't necessarily *have to* pay it forward to the customer immediately, but competition will deal with that over time on its own. Anyway, it's a good choice for merchants already **right now**. They can only save money that way.
As I also already said, Bitpay is just for comfort. Give it a little time, someone will probably provide an open source system that merchants can use do do the simple immediate conversion themselves. It's not like it's that complicated... merchant has an account at mt.gox (or somewhere else soon, hopefully..), little script moves funds from his receiving address to mt.gox and sells. Done. I wouldn't even pay the 1% to do that, it's trivial.

The high volatility is only a sign of Bitcoin's youth. Once it has reached general acceptance, it will stabilize. And that has nothing to do with the fact that people "buy and hold" it. And it's definitely not "stupid" to do that. If anything, it's stupid to *not* do that.
You don't tell people how to use their money, period. If they think it's best to hold onto it, then that's what they're gonna do. Preaching "spend it, spend it" is completely pointless. If that kind of extrinsic meddling was necessary, bitcoin wouldn't stand a chance. But it isn't.
What you're looking at with Bitcoin is basically very, very scarce digital gold, that is still not valued much by the world. If you were back in the past and came across gold before people were actually using it, and you got a pound of it for basically nothing. Would you *really* say that the best thing you could do in that scenario is run around and give it to other people for also basically nothing? You have this thing in your hand, you see its potential, feel that it is worth much more than what you can presently get for it, and you actually think it's smart to give it away for less? It's not. If you believe in Bitcoin, it's absolutely fine to hold onto it. 
That doesn't mean though that you can't support businesses that accept bitcoin. If I want to spend some, I just buy them back right when I spend them. But at any time, I'm sitting on (a rather large) stack of coins.

I use blockchain.info and inputs.io mainly as my online wallets and bitcoin-qt locally.
I think inputs.io needs more users and sites that cooperate with it, because i think an off-chain-transaction system like they use is very helpful and a great next layer for usability on top of bitcoin. With it, I can for example just give you my email, or username, and you can send me coins, instantly (no waiting for confirmations), without the hassle of using btc addresses.

Dude, they're a scam. It doesn't matter if they'd deliver everything within a week now (which they won't do...), they are already proven to be a scam, this isn't some speculation for the future.

That is something that is basically unfeasible though. It makes sense for **some** things, but it's not feasible for others. 
Example: I'm in on multiple miner-group buys, where someone sets up and maintains the miner and pays to me what it produces on a weekly basis (less a small managment fee). Do you expect me to give him a new address to pay to every week? Do you expect him to maintain and manually update a list of hundreds of addresses for each of his clients every week? That would be ridiculous. Right now, everybody gives him an address to pay to and that's it. And that is fine. What problem do you see with that?

@_date: 2013-08-19 22:26:08
Well I didn't make 10000% ROI like someone suggested. But I've been in bitcoin just since january and without actually crunching the numbers now, it was easily a profit of about 1700-2000% over what I put in. I think that's pretty OK for an investment over half a year. But it's nothing compared to what could have been possible if I trusted my gut at the right times. Not alone from holding bitcoins and their increase in value, but also due to investing in the right stocks or other investment opportunities. 
To be fair though, most of my spare time is consumed by bitcoin now, it has become kind of an obsession and a second job to me. If you're just getting into bitcoin, take it slow. Nothing is guaranteed here, and as many people make money, many people also lose money by making wrong predictions. You also have to have a good feeling for when something is "too good to be true", because then it is most likely a scam - there are a lot of scammers in bitcoin that like to exploit the weak, and there isn't much in place to stop them, except common sense. It's every man on his own here.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:19:36
While it might be true that people *think* that and it really dicourages them from spending, it's a logical fallacy in my opinion.
If it were such a given that bitcoin will rise to $10,000, why would anyone still have any dollars? It wouldn't make any sense. While we all *want* it to happen, we obviously are not sure about it.
And you can also easily avoid the psychological illusion of "spending something that will be worth more". If you have dollars and want to buy something with btc, but don't want to decrease the amount of btc that you're holding to speculate on, you can just buy btc again to make up for what you spent. If I want to buy something for $100, I can buy it with btc and then just buy new btc for $100. I will have spent exactly the $100, the volatility of bitcoin is completely out of the picture. But just to clarify: that's just a psychological measure to feel better, it's not really "more safe" or anything. I hope it's clear what I mean.

Interesting. 
Since it was confirmed that the ransomware actually "works" and decrypts the files when you've paid, I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to fake it and get it to decrypt without paying.
The program has to check some external source for the confirmation of the tx. Just edit the domain checked (possibly blockchain.info) in the hosts file and have it reroute to localhost, where a little script sends back a false positive instead.
I don't understand why someone would pay this ransom.... rather pay a friendly hacker to get this done for you.

The ~1000TH/s we still need to get to 200m difficulty will not come from the little USB miners, not even in any significant part. 1000 TH equal about 3 million of those miners. I know that's not your point, just making it clear. Those toys play little part in this game.
Prices going down is a given, sure. But the problem is not that the few companies who are actually making ASIC miners have *too little orders*, the limiting factor is the speed at which they can be produced and distributed. Not only is this common sense, it has been proven time and time again by all the delays of the manufacturers. For exponential growth to continue, suppliers have to be able to also show exponential growth in production and distribution, which is something that is inherently limited by how the real world works. 
It's really tough to say how long increases in production with existing producers and rises of new producers can sustain this level of growth, but I can tell you one thing for sure: not forever.
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:28:20
You certainly have a point. And if we're looking at the **end** of october, I'd agree with you, 200m difficulty then is probably wishful thinking. But at the **start** of october, I'd be surprised.

You can measure bitcoins in kg too, and come to find out that there's very, very little weight there. So it *is* a lot more scarce than gold in that regard. Not that it would make much sense measuring it like that though and I agree that it was stupid to put that statement there.

If you don't know ASICMINER, you must be new here.
AM is a well known mining company in the bitcoin space, and the biggest success of any bitcoin business this year. You can buy shares from them and get paid dividends weekly from those shares, proportionally to the bitcoins that the company mined, and the revenue from sales of mining hardware. A share is 1/400,000th of the company, [they trade around ~0.44 BTC/share currently]( making this a &gt;$140 million company. 
I wouldn't recommend getting in there now, or into any BTC securities at the moment, but they made many of us, including me, a *shitload* of money during the summer.

He is correct, one private key makes one public key.


A "wallet" is nothing else but a bunch of private keys. All the individual private keys for your addresses are all in your wallet. I never liked the term "wallet". "Keychain" would be a much better description.
The reason you can create new addresses and still recover them with an old backup (I assume you're talking about the bitcoin-qt client), is because bitcoin-qt has a "buffer" of like 100 keys/addresses that it creates in advance, and those are already stored in your wallet. So when you create a new address, it just gives you one of the pre-created buffer keys, and creates a new key to fill up the buffer again. 
They did that just for the purpose you described, so that you don't need to backup your wallet every single time you create a new address. It's still not an ideal solution, because you'd still need to do more or less regular backups, or you'd reach the point where the addresses from your old backed up wallet run out. 
Some bitcoin clients already support so-called "deterministic wallets" to solve that problem. That just means that every private key that will ever get created in that wallet is calculated from a base seed. So all you need to back up is that seed, and if you lose access to your addresses, you can re-calculate all your previously created keys with that seed.
Hope that cleared it up a bit. Let me know if you have more questions
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:28:32
No. I don't need to spend a single one of my coins to "win" anything. 
When I spent money on bitcoin, I bought something that is worth a lot more than what I paid for it. I don't need to sell it again to "make a profit".
@_date: 2013-07-27 23:41:55


No, not at all. But I watch it closely, like i do many things. I think the idea is sound and I guess it's an ok way to let your coins work for you, I just think there are other investments right now that promise better returns. 
How much profit just-dice creates for you is based strongly on 3 things: 
- what % of the total coins invested in the site are from you
- how much people actually gamble at the site
- luck
While you can always know the first one, the last two are hard to estimate and vary greatly. That just doesn't really appeal to me. I think investing with them is just like gambling, only that the odds are slightly in your favor.

The whole article makes it sound like M-Pesa is integrating Kipochi, but it's the other way around. Kipochi, a bitcoin wallet, integrates M-Pesa support. That is all. Most people using M-Pesa will probably not switch from their working solutions to a bitcoin wallet.

I'm not sure what you think I mean. 
When I say "fork", I don't mean a blockchain fork, I just mean a software fork of the reference client. There would just be another client out there. Just like you already have multiple clients today (Multibit, Electrum etc alongside of bitcoin-qt), there would be another fork of bitcoin-qt, which would not use anything bad some government wanted to add. 
If you say they were to change the underlying protocol of bitcoin itself - that's just not gonna happen. Nobody would support that.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:57:46
Well, that deserves to be seen. So far, it has not been true for **any** ASIC (except Avalaon batch 1 I think), definitely not any from BFL.
And if he paid $100 for 2GH more, then no, it probably won't pay off for itself. Ever. He'd need to make ~0.8 btc, which with 2GH and current difficulty would already take about 4 months (completely ignoring electricity costs). And if you have some foresight, you know what will happen to the difficulty within these months. If you think you have seen exponential growth, wait till KnC ships. It's going to be a bloodbath.

No, not "safely". Offline or not doesn't help here. The problem is that there is no real "random" with (non-quantum) computers.
Ok, on the risk of giving the wrong people ideas, here is how I would attack this, if I were to, and the reasoning behind it:
- Javascript's Math.random() uses the current time in milliseconds as a seed for the random calculation
- That means that at every millisecond of the day, there is ONE default result for everyone watching the page. So if you and I access the page at the exact same time, we get the same result.
Knowing that's how it works, you can easily calculate all the results for the past week and check if there's any Bitcoins on them. Granted, that's a lot of results to check (1000 per second, that's 86400000 per day), but it's definitely not impossible.
@_date: 2013-10-09 13:25:02
I agree. My bought coins are already hardly "anonymous", since by now I have to completely identify myself to the exchanges. But it's still the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to move value around without relying on a central authority that I know is going to fuck me one way or another.

Who says I don't think they will be able to compete? I have much faith in their ability to stay competitive. But that doesn't mean they can hold those high dividends. They can't get more from mining than they currently are, because Bitcoin. And the hardware sales will eventually drop, that's for sure. How long that will take is debatable, the market will decide that. But I'd say rather sooner than later, especially if the competition finally starts caching up.


That's not true. Show me those numbers please. I think they get about 0.015 per share on mining revenue, at best. 


That doesn't matter at all. More hashrate doesn't mean more bitcoins. It only means that they'll probably be able to hold their current mining income for a while. But the expenses increase, albeit slowly.
edit: Maybe you're right and it was about ~50% this week. Still, that's half of the total income. That is a lot.

The most weak point, security wise, would probably be the brain wallet. How did you create the passphrase? Is it something you "just came up with"? In that case, it's probably bad.

If you want to create a secure passphrase, use something like [diceware]( and 10+ words.

That would still enable you selling the private key to someone else. That's the thing, it does **not** prove that you have been the owner for 12 months. But what else does? I don't know.
Also, and more importantly, what if you have been using the coins in the bitcoin economy (invest etc) without exchanging for fiat? They have moved a lot but that shouldn't matter. And I don't think that's what you need to prove. The whole idea of holding them for 12 months in a constant place is stupid and goes against the whole concept of using bitcoin for what they were made. 
And I don't think that's what you'd need to prove. You'd just have to prove where and how many bitcoins you obtained originally.

Well, that's a lie. Don't listen to what he claims, instead use a [simple calculator]( and you'll see that instead, *at current difficulty*, with 280GH/s, you'll mine about 0.74 BTC/day, or 22.62 BTC/month. So to recoup your investment of 64+ BTC (8000$), it's closer to 3 months - and that is not including electricity costs &amp; maintenance. And if you can know one thing for sure, it's that the difficulty will not stand still.
Also, as some have pointed out already: The exchange rate of BTC doesn't matter one teeny tiny bit here. So you can't say "although if BTC value goes up then so does profit" - no, no, no. If you have to count on a BTC price increase for the miner to be profitable, just buy the bitcoins!
My advice would be that you don't buy it. The guy is not giving it away for that price because he's nice, he gives it away because he knows there is small chance for him to mine for more. Just use your money to buy bitcoins and it's very likely you're going to be better off.
If you really, really want to mine, you might want to rather look at [cointerra]( They offer a 2 TH/s (minimum!) for $6k. Delivery starting only in January, but still: that is 7.14 times (minimum!) what you're getting here, for $6k instead of $8k+. So for the same money, you're getting about 10 times the hashrate. That means that for the KnC-Miner to be a better investment, difficulty would have to increase 10-fold until January. Not impossible, but quite unlikely in my opinion.

It's obvious you're just calculating in the way "uhh so I paid $xxx for the miner, and now the bitcoin it produces are worth more than $xxx so *it was a good investment*". And that is stupid and delusional. It's called "The Miner's Fallacy". You have to take how much **in bitcoin** it costs when you buy the miner, and compare that to how much bitcoin it produces.

You don't "get 5$ off". You only get 5$ off of the imaginery wrong average you calculated before. You spend 2000$ on 16.6666666 Bitcoins in total, that is all there is to say.


If we're reasonably sure about that, the logic thing to do is spend all money right now at 120, sell all at 150 and buy back at 100.
I don't even know why this stuff needs to be explained, it's so goddamn obvious it hurts my brain. How can you people actually calculate with this stuff and not see the fallacies you're falling for?

Well, you can just import the private key into a wallet of your choice, and then you can use the address just like you can use any address in your wallet. You don't have to take all the funds into another address, you just "unlock" access to the address by importing your private key.
But the point of the paper wallet is that the private key is never supposed to touch your computer after you initially printed it out, only when you want to take the btc out. So that even if your computer becomes riddled with viruses, trojans or whatever, your btc are still safe. So when you just want to take a few of the btc out, it makes sense to move the rest of the coins to a new, unused paper wallet. That's why it also makes sense to just print out a bunch in advance, you can just use them over time.

That is not what bitcoin is for. If you want to do it with your phone, it's always going to be more complicated than swiping a credit card. The solution is not to make this easier, just not use direct bitcoin transactions for that.

For what you describe (outpacing the network), someone would have to beat 1 confirmation. For that a person would already have to wait 10 minutes in front of the vending machine, which is unacceptable.
If a vending machine was supposed to accept at 0 confirmations, nobody would need to outpace the rest of the network in anything. A race attack/double spend is very much possible in that scenario.
As much as I'd like paying with bitcoin like this for regular stuff, it's not going to happen, at least not any time soon. You can't wait a minimum of 10 minutes if you want to pay for your drink, or for your gas, or anything really. And you can't expect a merchant to just accept your 0-confirmation payment. A 0 confirmation double spend isn't so hard to achieve that this risk can just be forgotten... why do you think we have the whole confirmation system?
In my opinion, bitcoin isn't made for this stuff. Maybe it gets bent to be in the future, but right now - I don't see it.
@_date: 2013-08-11 13:12:38
The technical details on where this problem comes from: 
Basically, the problem is that whenever a transaction is signed by a client (= whenever you send coins to someone), a random number is involved in signing. If that same random number is ever used **again** to sign a transaction from the **same** address, someone seeing both signed transactions can calculate that addresses private key.
The fact that this seems to occur frequently with the android wallets indicates that something is off with their random number creation, resulting in the same random number created more often than it should. ~~**However**, this is a general problem with ALL clients.~~ With proper random number creation, you have a ~~relatively~~ very, very low risk of hitting the same number multiple times.
The best to advise for now is that you should not re-use addresses. But I definitely think this is a **major** problem that needs to be fixed somehow.
edit: I was exaggerating here. It's only a major problem for the affected wallets (the android implementation apparently). Properly implemented, it's safe.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:28:01
If your name isn't "John Smith" or something similar, it's definitely random enough. Lacking entropy with the common words is not a problem if you have personal information enclosed. One single character wrong and the result is wrong.

Nail on the head. It will take something else than a quasi-clone to get on bitcoin's throne.
I like comparing Bitcoin to TCP/IP. It's far from perfect, there are hundred alternative ways it maybe could have been done better, but still the whole internet as we know it uses it today. It was simply *good enough* to disrupt the existing solutions and be the foundation on which everything else was built. The exact same thing applies to bitcoin. It's *good enough*. All those alt-coins are pointless, all they do is undermine bitcoin and decrease its value.
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:02:07
I agree with the "return to the mean value after bubble" part. But I would rather say we're still in the last phase of the bubble crashing and that the btc-e price is still too high..
I don't think we've seen the low yet. I expect it to drop more over the next months, except something big happens that causes another jump in adoption.
Keep in mind that we have a steady inflation of 3600 btc per day, without increased interest, it's just natural that the price declines.

"Bitcoin" as the system/protocol is a global ledger of transactions that is completely decentralized and supported by a big network of computers that validate the transactions. It allows people to securely faciliate transactions without relying on third parties (like banks) who can (and have proven to) abuse trust.
A "bitcoin" as a unit of currency is the unit that is used in these transactions. It is more an "unquantified" value (don't know how else to put it), so you don't have to put too much attention to what "one bitcoin" is. It is *1 bitcoin*, just like you have *1 glass of water*, or more fitting, *1 ounce of gold*. Just a unit of measurement. You can split up bitcoins into as many pieces as you like, so you don't have to own 1 coin, you can just own 0.00001 if you like.
It is a revolutionary system, nothing like it has ever existed before, that's why it is a bit complicated to understand. But trust me, it's worth it. Again, nothing like it has ever existed before, and you will undoubtedly hear more of it in the coming years. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:16:56


This *might* become a reason waaaay in the future, when Bitcoin actually *becomes* deflationary. It is not currently and will not become for many years. Currently, the supply is increased by 25 BTC every 10 minutes - hardly "deflationary", eh? 
Right now the increase in price is because of more people joining in for speculation.


There are more of them than there were back then, that is really all there is to say. A limited good demanded by more people -&gt; higher price, even if the individual "confidence" is lower.


That is correct. Doesn't matter though, all that creates is a *flow* that helps in finding a fair valuation.
The biggest mistake you're making, like many people, is focussing on the "currency" aspect so much. Bitcoin is a technology. It does what it does, and what people make of it remains to be seen. I too am not too convinced that it will receive widespread use as a "currency" per say any time soon, and yes, many people here are fooling themselves in that regard. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have value. What bitcoin accomplishes is giving the world a system that enables decentralized, secure consensus on transactions and property. Saying that has no value "because of volatility" is completely missing the bigger picture.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:00:20


Nothing is set in stone. Everything works for the people who agree with how it works. What Bitcoin *is* is only what the majority agrees what it is. 
Effectively, big changes fork the blockchain - there are people who "agree" with the change and build upon the new chain, and people who don't agree and keep building onto the old one. That's why any big change needs to be supported by a big majority to be a good idea. If we were to change the proof of work function to scrypt for example, a lot of people would deny that and in the end, we'd have *two* Bitcoins.

While I see that futures could be a nice thing for some people, I don't get why merchants would need them right now. They can just exchange for the current market price when they make the sale. Like what bitpay offers. But nobody even needs bitpay IMO. They could just do it themselves.

Then you have never used Paypal as a seller and had a dispute. Seller loses, 99% of the time.

ASICminer is so far the best and most promising investment with bitcoin I have made. If you're in bitcoin for the long run, like I am, this is definitely something to consider. If you think that bitcoin will grow in value over time, it's kind of a way to lever your profit. Bitcoin grows in value + the amount of bitcoin you have grows due to the dividends.
Contrary to the article, I'd suggest buying on bitfunder though. It's a little more complicated to set up (because you also need an account on  but you're not paying any dividend fees, and the share price is usually lower.

No. This can not be measured and thus, this number is wrong. And the real number that we can't know is much, much higher. At least by my estimation. Definitely &gt;20%
Saying that because SR made up 4% of ALL bitcoin transactions that means it makes up 4% of the bitcoin "economy" is ridiculous. You have to know how much bitcoins are actually used to buy goods. And that is not much. As much as many would like to think, few people really use bitcoin to buy stuff. Except drugs.

No. The number of miners has nothing to do with confirmation. One confirmation means someone took your transaction into a valid block. So this can only happen as fast as blocks are mined, and with blocks being created every ~10 minutes, it doesn't go any faster than that.
This will not change in the foreseeable future (only if the whole bitcoin protocol was changed).
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:28:20
That's what I mean by saying that people are ignoring that this is not a traditional security. You can't compare this with buying shares in something like Google.
By buying shares, you're essentially buying a miner with a speed of (AM Hashrate)/400000. Currently, that's about 75 MH/s. Nothing. Even if you expect AM's hashrate to go up 10x, that's 750 MH/s for ~3.5 BTC. NOTHING. The only thing making it interesting is the hardware sales. But if you're not a complete idiot without any foresight, you'll know that is a short time thing that will flatten out very fast. Any way you see it, there is nothing justifying such a share price in the long run.
And **trust me**, there will be a point when a bunch of people realize this. There will be some news about a competitor delivering, a huge drop in AM's percentage of the network or something similar, and the share price will crash like it's nothing.

I don't quite understand why this is an issue... There's a minimum fee for small amounts to prevent too much spam like this. 
And for the content of the data, that's completely irrelevant. Like others have said, patterns in random data that have to be decoded in a specific way to actually mean something do no harm on its own. And it's not like they could easily encode pictures or even videos like this in the blockchain... an URL is really the best you can do, and what should be a concern then is that URL, not the blockchain...

Didn't you say it was the brainwallet that blockchain.info creates automatically for you? That should not be insecure on its own. Did you use your own words or not? If you did, that **is** most definitely the reason. Since you can't use/trust the passphrase anymore now anyway, you can just tell us what it was, and we can tell you what's wrong with it (if that's the case).
edit: I just saw [btcrobinhood's comment]( Dude, DO NOT use brainwallets like this, that throws your complete security overboard! If you had just used that sentence and added a password at the end of it, it would be **a lot** safer. So your brainwallet was "You don't win friends with salad!". If you had made it "You don't win friends with salad! mijas29%462" I'd assure you, no one would crack it. The trick with brainwallets is to use something you can easily remember + a unique password that is **not** made of common words.

Those are exchanges. Do you have a bitcoin client? Have you done any transaction?
I sounds to me like you're just keeping your bitcoin at Bitcoin-24, like an online-wallet. Don't do that. If the site gets hacked, shut down by the government, a terrorist bombs their servers or whatever, your bitcoin are gone.
They are safest in your own hands.
If you withdraw your bitcoin from Bitcoin-24 to any wallet, you'll pay the 0.0005 fee. If you send anyone else a transaction, you'll pay **a** fee. You can choose how high you want to set it, but the higher you pick it, the faster it will be processed. I have mine set at 0.0001 for now, but that's already too high. The fee is supposed to be trivial, not worth over 1 cent.

The volatility that we currently see will be much less in the future, if bitcoin goes mainstream.
But that doesn't matter anyway - with services like Bitpay, that allow merchants to have their bitcoin payments converted to fiat at the current exchange rate, this problem just doesn't exist.
You said


No. You don't seem to get the advantage here. Bitcoin is a basically free payment system. If you pay with dollars, you're using a credit card, or paypal, or any other payment processor. The people that run those take quite substantial fees from your payment. Not so with bitcoin. If you use bitpay, they take a &lt; 1% fee, which is cheaper than any other payment processor I know of. 
But you wouldn't even need to have them. I think a lot of people don't get that. Bitpay doesn't do anything magical. It's just a little extra layer of ease for merchants who don't want to have to take care of the details. As a merchant, you could just as well easily implement your own little piece of software that just exchanges the payments you get immediately to fiat.

The misconception that this question arises from is the thought that the bitcoins are *on* your computer, or something like that. They're not. Bitcoins are values always just represented *in the network*, you are merely accessing them from your computer, if you have the key to unlock them. The wallet on your computer is nothing but a collection of keys to access addresses *in the network*. 
That means what your client is doing (e.g. synchronizing) doesn't change anything about whether you can receive your coins. If someone sends coins to your address, it will be written to the ledger (the blockchain) and practically, that's when you "receive" them. When your client is finished synchronizing, it checks the blockchain for transactions to you and sees you've got something. But the act of "receiving" has nothing to do with your individual client.

This is about withholding your solution for a block from a pool. I think what's meant there is that they can withhold the solution from the pool and publish the block themselves, getting the full reward as a solo miner.
It has nothing to do with not having to publish blocks you have found right away. The block you find must fit the block before, you can't just collect blocks and release them when you want to.

I see how you might read me that way, but that's far from the truth. I'm not rooting for the price to plummet, but I'd have been a lot happier with a healthy, steady growth of AM valuation, that would then turn into a slow, steady decline after the peak is reached. It's the same thing with the value of bitcoin itself (except that doesn't have to decline). These bubbles are just hurtful for the majority of people and for the whole system. 
I can see how I seem bitter to you, but it's just the frustration about the irrationality I see in others, and the ignorance when I'm trying to make them see things my way. I really do have a problem with having to be right... but I'm not bitter because I'm losing out, hell no. Practically every decision I have made in bitcoin has turned out great so far. You would have seen the same "bitter" posts after I sold in the bubble. The decision to sell was absolutely correct, and from an outside point of view, it's clear that it can only be a bubble, but people just won't listen - that's what's so frustrating. You preach and you preach, and get shut down by ignorant one-liners of people who only have dollar signs in their eyes. I don't even start trying to argue on this sub that the bubble is still far from finished crashing and that we're going to see more decline over the next few months, possibly even to a low of under $50. People want to hear what they want to hear.
While I'm glad that I could at least serve the purpose of amusing you with my posts, I think I'll just lay off off these threads from now on and let people make their own experiences. Best of luck to you, I hope for your sake that I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:33:59
I have a hard time sharing that enthusiasm. Obviously, they wouldn't just "dump their coins" like a bunch of morons. Instead, they would hold a price ceiling over bitcoin for quite some time, maybe slowing gains in price for years. And while doing that, they will earn hundreds of millions of dollars (if not billions) that they did in no way earn or buy, but instead outright **stole**. How that shit is legal is beyond me. "Oh yeah, that's drug money - so now it's **our** drug money, ha ha!"
I really see nothing positive in the fact that the US government likely owns (or rather, will own after DPR's process is through) the largest amount of coins of any entitity in the world. There's no scenario where that one plays out fair and well. It's shit. It just completely sucks.

Honestly, that's not really what I have in mind when I think escrow... I thought you release the escrow when we confirm that we got our coins..

It depends strongly on the amount you're withdrawing. You probably withdrew something small.
I withdrew about 2500 euro **more than a month ago**, still haven't seen anything. 
Then I withdrew the lousy 30€ that were left on the account **4 days ago** and they have already arrived at my bank. 
I'm furious about that shit. If they have a limited number of withdrawals they can process per day, they should do it in a way that they can process the *biggest amount of money* and not process all these tiny amounts. If they're doing what it looks like, and using up their limited abilities for just withdrawing these small amounts, and nothing big, my money will **never** come.
I'm seriously thinking now about cancelling my 2500€ withdrawal and make it 50x50€. The problem with that is that they take a 1% fee on withdrawals, **but with a minimum of ~1.20€**, so paying out these small amounts would cost me more than double on fees.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:12:07
Nope. It's just a bitcoin client and acts as a node in the network. That means it relays transactions it gets from other nodes, but it doesn't mine them (tries to solve a block and put them in it).

What is the problem here? 
If he were to say "the bounty is 10 BTC" and then in a month, BTC is worth 10 times what it is now, he'd have to adjust the bounty. And then adjust it again, and again. So instead, he prices it at something that he thinks is more stable. Completely understandable. The purchasing power of BTC constantly changes, rapidly. So setting a fixed btc bounty makes no sense for him.

A "full node" means a full node in the bitcoin network. When you download and run the bitcoin-qt client, it downloads the entire blockchain (= the history of all transactions that ever took place in bitcoin) and acts like a node in the bitcoin network. It connects to other peers, relays transactions that other people send, etc.
Without these nodes, the bitcoin network couldn't work, so they're important. But it's not the first thing a new user should use. Downloading the entire blockchain via bitcoin-qt can take days, even weeks depending on your internet connection. There are other clients who don't do this, they work with a simplified method called [SPV]( which also works great as long as there are still other full nodes around. Multibit (and I think Electrum?) are clients that use this.

Using them also costs money. Trying to have a mining operation that scales with the speed at which you can produce the chips is a completely different and complex undertake on its own. You have to manage a shitload of machines in a big datacenter. There is a lot of infrastructure to create and maintain to keep that going. Really, do you think it's only a matter of producing millions of chips and then throwing them into a corner and they'll make money?
So no, it's not necessarily stupid to assume that a chip producer would sell chips that could reach ROI. He could very well make more profit with selling them than with mining with them himself.

In my opinion, it's about time that this growth in price happens. There is a lot going on surrounding the infrastructure around bitcoin, lots of startups have been founded this year. Overall, the past months there was a very good "feeling" in the air, the media coverage got a lot more understanding and accurate, stuff like this...
I believe what we're seeing does definitely not qualify as a bubble. I think the price will go up quite a bit further in the next months. But it might end up in another bubble again, because that's just what tends to happen if the price starts rising quickly.

But you can in hindsight evaluate if it was a good decision or not. And that evaluation has to go "Would it have been better to just keep bitcoins, or did my machine give me more bitcoins?" And not "Now that the price of bitcoin is higher a year later, is my machine making more fiat money in bitcoins than it would have cost in fiat money a year ago?" 
Because then you are not evaluating the investment in the miner, but the investment in bitcoin itself, which is not part of the equation here. If bitcoin price went up, then yes, your investment in bitcoin was a success. But you know that already. You're "cheating" if you take that into the evaluation of the *miner*.

"were transacted over the blockchain" is not the same as "the economy". That means "were used to buy goods &amp; services". Not even close, not even in the ballpark. I transacted 100 BTC today between ME and ME, and then I transacted 50 BTC to someone else. And none of these btc were used to buy anything. The traffic seen on the Silk Road instead **is** exactly that: people buying goods. Relating blockchain traffic with economic activity is **so** ridiculous. Even making that comparison to show that SR has "just" 5% **of the whole BTC traffic** is so damn desperate.
Again: Your 5% make no sense and are just a completely ridiculous figure used to make it look less than it actually is. FIVE PERCENT of ALL blockchain traffic, that is fucking insanely huge. I didn't think it was that much. And again: the percentage of bitcoins used to actually buy goods is much, much higher than 5%. Rarely anyone buys anything with bitcoin. Except drugs.

This will never be the case. The amount of btc will never exceed 21 million, but that doesn't mean it reaches 21m and then just stops. I feel this is a misconception many people have.
The amount of btc released per block halves every 4 years, and thus it will never exceed 21 million. But it could approach it forever.

The problem arised way before that, when the FED started printing more money than they had backed in gold, to finance world war 1. That was already around ~1918, more than 50 years before Nixon's decision. 
When the WWI ended, there was much more paper money in the economy than what was actually supported by gold (but the general population had no idea), which created a time of false "boost" for the economy (the "roaring 20's") - people were investing their inflated currency into stocks and thus the stock prises were booming. Looks good for a while, but in reality, it's a bad symptom. Later, it became more and more obvious to the public what their government had done, and that the money they had could never be redeemed for gold. That led to people selling their stocks in masses to redeem their gold. The result was a giant crash, that resulted in what is known today as "The Great Depression". 
Awesome, isn't it? Some crooks decide they need to finance a war, so they complete fuck over their own nation and the rest of the world for *decades*. Later, they decided that because the country couldn't pay back all the gold, they would just confiscate all privately owned gold. You can read that as "they stole all the gold from their people to back the fantasy money they printed before". But even that wasn't enough (not even close) to pay up for what the FED had done, and finally, after many years, Nixon capitulated and basically just shrugged and said "OK, so now we don't have any backing anymore, it's just all fantasy money now - deal with it." And that's the system we're living in today. It would be funny if it wasn't so goddamn sad. I'm leaving out some more or less important parts here, but that's basically the gist as far as I can tell.
To me, it's obvious that the only reason a gold-backed system doesn't work and will never work is because you have those people in control that *just don't play by the rules*, and abuse the trust given to them. You have a system where it's clearly stated that $20 = 1 ounce of gold, and then these *fuckers* go behind your back and just print more of it without telling you, so they can build some tanks and airplanes.
If you're not aware yet, all this shit is why we need Bitcoin, and all this shit is the reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place.

"20nm, which is the size of the chip"
That's a bit small for a chip, don't you think, Trace? A human hair is about 500 times thicker than that. What is meant by 20nm is the process used in fabrication. And by the way, we are nowhere near seeing any bitcoin ASIC operating on such a small process.

It's not the old rumor, it's a completely new rumor, with the "Phoenix fund" involved, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. involved and this whole 20nm thing that all wasn't part of the old (2011) news. The old one was just because it was another company named Avalon that had nothing to do with bitcoin.
Nonetheless, I agree on the part that the whole story is bullshit. I'd bet that it is completely fabricated. And it makes a lot of sense to spread this nonsense - all the mining securities have tanked, because people are fucking stupid. Even if the story was true, that wouldn't immediately concern the ongoing projects. Anyway, I bet the people who made this up have profited greatly by getting in on a lot of cheap shares (as have I/will I have once the market recovers).

If you want to "really understand bitcoins" you just fucking read about them. No stupid little asic miner is going to change your understanding of bitcoin.
If you want to "get your feet wet" with bitcoin *mining* and knowing you'll never make a profit, you can just use your GPU for that. 
There is absolutely no rational reason for anyone to buy these things. The **only** reason I can see is because they look cute. They are **not** more newbie friendly than mining with the hardware that you already have, they are **not** "decentralizing   the network" more than if you'e mining with the hardware that you already have.
If you want to throw $100 away for a little chip thingy that costs maybe $1 in production, knowing that you'll never get your money back, go ahead. Otherwise, speculate on getting a real miner that at least has the possibility of making a profit.

The price there isn't going ballistic because many people still trust that they'll get their money out of gox. And I think that's a good strategy if you can wait a little for your money. The people selling there make a killing in $ since the price is so high.
Buy bitcoins at bitstamp, move to gox, sell, rinse, repeat. All you have to have is faith that gox will eventually pay you. And contrary to some of the people here who like to panic and grab the pitchforks at the first opportunity, I believe they will. People still get their money from gox all the time, it's just quite a bit delayed at the moment.

Yes, it means exactly that. You made a profit by **Bitcoin**, not by **mining**.
You have to keep in mind that you are already buying BTC when you buy the miner. Only that by buying the miner, you bought **less** than if you had gone through the easier and faster process of just buying BTC directly.
Your investment in **Bitcoin** was a success, because BTC-price has gone up, but your investment in the miner was bad, because you paid more BTC than the BTC you got out of it.

It would take them 133 days at current difficulty.
The rest of your post is wild speculation. When difficulty rises, they will have already mined a lot, so I'd estimate that after a year or less, they will start making profit. And this statement:


"pretty much useless"? Why? Will it not produce bitcoins anymore? Do you think it will not be worth it because the bitcoins they mine won't cover the electricity cost anymore? If so, why would anyone still mine then? And if they stopped mining, difficulty would adapt, making it profitable again. What I'm saying is, there is no "they'll never make their money back" scenario - except the hardware breaks or Bitcoin as a whole becomes worthless, and that is the speculation they're willing to take.

Then it's quite unlikely they just guessed it, I dunno then.


When you enter your alias (miguelos for example) on blockchain.info, it gets translated to your identifier (something like 1a39c9f5-4119-5d73-8f39-2e8962153b7). If someone knows that identifier, they basically have your wallet, as in they can download it. It's still encrypted with your password though, so they can't access anything. But if they have a downloaded wallet, they can try to brute force it offline. If your password is safe (20+ random characters), it doesn't really matter, because they will never crack it anyway, offline or not. But if it's not that safe, there is a chance they can crack it. This is why blockchain.info introduced this email-confirmation some months ago. So when someone wants to turn your alias into an identifier, to download your wallet, they would first need the confirmation from the email.
In blockchain.info's "security"-settings there's an option to block TOR ips from even trying to access your wallet. You should set that. Not because there's much risk of them being successful, but to avoid these annoying (and a bit scary) emails.

But if you're a new user, you don't know about "change addresses". You think "OK I just transferred 0.5 from my 20 BTC to **that** address, so the rest is still on **this** address.", which is completely reasonable and intuitive. Having the change go some place else that you might not even know about (because bitcoin-qt hides it from you) is **very** confusing. 
What you suggest would be a good alternative IMO. But the "Send change to address xxx" field should still be defaulted to the sending address.

Transactions are confirmed at the target rate of ~10 minutes/confirmation, independent on the amount of miners or full nodes running. 
But a full node in the network means another computer holding a copy of the entire blockchain, and another computer relaying transactions, which is always a good thing. There are for example some attacks theoretically possible with so called ["cancer nodes"]( where an attacker fills the network with many dishonest nodes. A big number of honest nodes make something like that a lot harder.

Stop using the term FUD so inflationary, if you don't know what it means. You even link to the wiki article, have you bothered reading it? It's only FUD if they intend to lower the share price with what they're saying. If that was their intention, they would plaster it in the AM-circlejerk thread and over reddit instead of an individual discussion thread. They're just stating their opinions, if you think they are wrong or not, that's not FUD.
The main point that you don't seem to get is that AM is building up a mining monopoly. And that doesn't have anything to do with "going over 51%" or something. It's obvious they wouldn't do that. That is not at all the only argument "that makes a little bit of sense". That is in fact the most stupid one.
They are a hardware selling company that also mines with that hardware. That is a joke in itself, everyone who buys hardware from them must be a complete fucking idiot. They wouldn't sell the hardware if they could make more money by mining with it. They would even be better off holding it back if they weren't able to deploy it themselves, just so they can mine cheaper for an extended period of time. Everyone should get this in their head: it would not be profitable for them to sell hardware that would ever see a ROI. Period. When they sell hardware, it has to be calculated in such a way that it WON'T see ROI. By being a mining company "that also sells hardware", they are just screwing with their poor customers. 
"Here, have 330 MH/s for 1 bitcoin, oh btw we're going to deploy 1 petahash before the year ends, just saying, so you know for a fact that you'll never ever possibly get your money back. If you buy this, you're retarded."
They will ALWAYS have the upper hand. They will have the mining hardware at production cost, an advantage no one else who doesn't make its own ASICs can ever have. Just try to play out how that will end if they keep being successful - there will be no profitable private mining anymore, because it simply CAN'T be profitable.
FUD FUD FUD I'm spreading FUD derp derp
I'm not even saying for sure that everything is so horrible about this. Maybe there will come other mining companies who also make their own ASICs that can compete with them and in the end, we'll have a few big mining companies and that will be the backbone of the economy. Could work out fine. But anyway, you just washing away any discussion with your stupid "FUD" argument isn't helping anyone. The way it's looking right now, AM could be a very dangerous thing for the bitcoin world. You are just blinded because you hope to get rich with them. Just try to imagine how you would value such a huge mining company in the bitcoin economy if you were NOT a shareholder.

So trust wouldn't be an issue in that regard, only in the way that you'd have to trust the service to stay **available**. That can be solved though by using a collaboration of servers/services, so for example you need 4 out of 6 signatures for a transaction. You have 3, and 3 independent servers have the other 3 (each one). That means the servers can't spend your coins (even if they work together, they can just get 3 sigs), and you only need 1 of the 3 to work to get to 4 sigs and spend your coins.
2. You don't even really need to "trust" anyone else with it. You could just create a dedicated server for that purpose for yourself and use that. But because of (1), that's really not even necessary.

Yes, it does. I suggest you think about this again. If I sell a bitcoin for $1000 on the market, that means someone paid $1000 for the bitcoin. Period. That money doesn't come out of thin air. Losing on spread has absolutely nothing to do with it.
And I never said that if you sell 1000 coins when the market price is $1000, that you get $1 million. I said that if you sold for $1 million, that that money has been paid in by other people.

ASICs or any other future hardware may increase the efficiency, but the thing it comes down to **is** energy. If efficiency increases, more of the same machines will be used, as long as cost of electricity + infrastructure &lt; value of bitcoins produced.

Maybe I should have said "arbitrary"... or maybe you people think the hashes calculated have some important purpose, instead of just being busy-work.
@_date: 2013-07-23 00:35:07
Here is how it basically works:
- a miner wants to make a block
- in that block he puts all the transactions from other people he wants to include in the block, plus one special transaction of 25 bitcoin (+ all the mining fees) to himself. These are the coins that get "created" with the block. The basic setup for the block is finished with that.
- now he puts a special number into the block, this is called the *nonce*. Basically a random number.
- he then calculates a hash over the complete contents of the block, including the nonce. This "hash" is nothing but a big number.
- now he needs to compare his hash with the current **target**. This is the "quoted number" you mean. If his block's hash is lower than the current target, then yippieh, he has found a valid block and can publish it, it will be added to the blockchain and other people will accept it as a valid block.
- if on the other hand, his hash was higher than the target, he changes the *nonce* to another number and hashes the block + nonce again. And this goes on and on until he finds a hash that is low enough. This happens all very fast. If someone says his miner does 1 MH/s (Megahash per second), that means he does this process 1 million times per second, 1 GH/s is 1 billion times per second and so on.

Blockchain.info (please mention the .info, because without it, that's another point to confuse noobs) uses the sender as the change address, which is why you experience this behaviour.


The fact that you "need" change for your transaction is based on the bitcoin protocol, and the ingenious way it works. That doesn't need to be altered, it's magnificient.
But it is definitely debatable if the change address needs to be a new one. Just so you understand, this is **only** done to improve anonymity. If I look at your transaction, with a change address I can't tell which transaction is the real one and which one is just change that goes back to you. If the change address is the same as the sender, it is always clear how much bitcoin you are sending, and to whom.

No, not to zero. I guarantee it will not go to zero. Before that happens, I'll buy all bitcoins in existence for $1. There: price over zero.
For something to have zero value, it has to trade at zero price. Which will never happen. Even if everyone forgets about it and stops trading, the value will still be higher than zero.
It might get **close** to zero, if everyone stops using it, but it will never be zero.

I'm not sure if you're serious. Do you know what you're doing? Do you know enough about bitcoin? Or do you just want to throw some money out the window, hoping that it'll somehow return to you?
Here's my advice: You don't want to get into bitcoin mining. If you knew what you were doing, you wouldn't be asking here, and if you don't know what you're doing, there is a near 0% chance you're going to do something profitable.
If you want to get into bitcoin, just buy bitcoins.
If you **really** want to mine, you have to get something on preorder, and trust the company that you'll eventually get your order. Everything you can buy **now** will simply not be profitable (think about it: why would anyone sell it to you if he could easily let it mine themself). If you want to **pre**order such a miner, I would recommend you order from [CoinTerra]( The way I see it, they're really the only promising seller right now. You'll get it in January, earliest.

I don't have anything against AM, I've been a shareholder for most of the time and made a ton of bitcoins from the project. But the share price is already becoming **very** unrealistic. People say things like "but it's still like 30% yield annualy, that is HUGE" and completely ignoring that this is not a tradtional dividend-paying security. There are so many false assumptions in expecting the high rates of dividends to stay up for *years*, it's surprising that some people actually believe it.

This is not a fact. It's a topic of constant debate, and I and most bitcoiners are on the side that it's complete bologny. You don't need an increasing money supply if you have an infinitely divisible currency. "Increasing the money supply" just means that a central organization makes money by selling money to the system that it knows will be worth less soon, by the very act of selling it to the system. It's nothing but a giant international scamming scheme as far as I can tell.

Depends on where you are. If you're in the U.S., to start out, Coinbase is probably your answer.
Then if you want a "physical wallet", you can easily create and print a paper wallet, using [bitaddress.org]( But, **important**: Be sure to do this on a safe computer, and don't keep anything of the paper wallet on your computer, that would ruin the whole point. When you're creating a safe cold storage, it's better to be paranoid than to have your coins stolen later because you got infected by some malware.
Also, I would suggest that you don't just put all of it on a paper wallet and forget about it, where's the fun in that? There's a lot to discover in bitcoin, even many investment opportunities if you care. You can for example put your coins into [coinlenders]( and enjoy a nice 25% yearly interest on your coins. No bank is giving you that.

In bitcoin, there isn't technically ownership represented as "this address owns X btc", there are only inputs and outputs. The sum of all (unspent) outputs with your address as destination is then interpreted as how much btc your address owns.
If I send 1 btc to you as one output, you own 1 btc. The network knows this because there is this one output directed at you, and you haven't spent it yet. Now if you want to send someone else 0.5 btc, bitcoin "spends" the output of 1 btc and takes it as input for the new transaction. Since you don't want to spend all of it, it creates 2 outputs, one with 0.5 to the recipient, and one with 0.5 back to yourself. 
In the standard bitcoin client, it sends the btc you get back to so called "change addresses", hidden addresses which you didn't create yourself. This is a concept that is often confusing to newbies.
Hope that clears it up a bit.

I completely agree. Reading all these posts about people randomly giving out paper wallets as Christmas gifts, I was just shaking my head... What a terrible gift. Laser engraved QR-code-keychains or similar for bitcoin enthusiasts, fine, that's a cool gift. But pushing your magic internet money that takes days to even explain properly onto random people? No! Not only is that quite literally the same as if you just gave them a dollar bill, completely unpersonal, it's also one that they can't even use easily.
When you give someone a gift, you're supposed to give them something **they** like, not something **you** like. And before you think "But it's going to be worth so much more in the future, and they'll definitely like it then" - you don't know that! You're just pushing your own rather radical belief onto them, just like a religious fanatic. Those too don't annoy you because they want to hurt you, they do it because they know "the end is near" or whatever.

Maybe someone finds this useful :)
It's a little tool I've been working on for the last week. It notices when you copy a bitcoin address and opens a window that shows information about the address and monitors it. I find it useful when I'm sending coins somewhere and am waiting on the confirmations. I was always checking blockchain.info manually to know how many confs I got, which got pretty annoying.
I also allows you to keep a list of your most used addresses ready and monitored.
The tool is still in absolute alpha and there might be a lot of bugs. If you find any, please tell me so I can get rid of them.

Generally, alt coins **can** be a good thing. They can explore different ideas.
Anyway, so far almost all altcoins have been platant and stupid copies of bitcoin that didn't change anything but a few variables. Those altcoins are a plague, followed by idiots with nothing in mind but shortterm financial gain. Exceptions are PPCoin, with proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, which is a very different and interesting approach, or PrimeCoin, where the proof-of-work is established by looking for specific chains of prime numbers - also interesting, but hardly useful. Both of these were developed by the same guy btw. Then there's Litecoin, which arguably also takes a little different approach than Bitcoin, using another hash function. Anyway, I think it doesn't really serve any purpose doing that, and I hope it dies rather sooner than later. I would much more like it if PPCoin instead was seen as "the silver to bitcoin's gold" (which is a stupid statement btw), but apparently, the market disagrees.
Will any altcoin take over bitcoin any time soon? Nope. That's because it not only has to be fundamentally different (otherwise bitcoin would just itself implement whatever better feature the altcoin has), but it also has to be **a lot** better. It's not enough if it's a bit better, because then bitcoin would still have the better publicity, established markets etc. The world is full of technologies that aren't actually "perfect", but they are good enough that they have spread, and replacing them with something marginally better wouldn't be worth the trouble.

No, she treats it as a commodity, which it is.


She never said they were. They are however very cheap ("almost for free") and very fast ("in seconds").


Correct, it's not difficult. But that's only the case because it is also absolutely insecure and exposes your private data to parties that you might not (and should not) want it exposed to. It is also only made easy for the end-user, the process involved in the background is overcomplicated and obsolete. Using your credit card to make a payment is basically the equivalent of giving someone else your bitcoin private key and saying "yeah but please just use it for this one purchase, k?". Do you know how big of a business credit card fraud is? And it's just really bad design that it's even possible in the first place.

Like I said, I'm glad someone convinced me not to fall for them. And whereever I can, I'll pay that forward. Every single person I can save from losing money on them is a win. My posts are not directed at the people who already sunk money into BFL, for you, it's just too bad. But these kind of threads keep popping up from time to time, when BFL tries to save what's left of their reputation. They send out a single jalapeno to a blog-writer, yadda yadda, and a few more people fall for it and pre-order something that they won't ever see before it's worthless.

And that Bundesbank guy in the Russia Today (urgh..) video you linked doesn't even say anything to confirm this. What he says is what the reality is: you can exchange your old DM for Euro - legal tender - and will continue do be able to do that. Not that they are **used** anywhere.

They are going to auction off the miners in the bitcointalk forums. When the time comes that they do this, these units will be **sold to ship**, not **preordered** like the rest of mining equipment that you can get now (Avalon/BFL). This makes it much more appealing in my opinion to buy from them - at least you know that when you buy it, it will be in the mail shortly after. Only thing I fear as an investor in their company is that they will not broadcast the auctions enough to get the profit they deserve.

Just a public and private key (or keys) on a piece of paper. see 


Wallet = bunch of private keys, usually encrypted. "Wallet" is kind of a misleading term, I think something like "Keychain" would be more appropriate.


Well, you should at least *know* that they are used by the default client. There will only be problems though if you just back up specific private keys and not your wallet (= all your keys, including those for the change addresses). What can happen is this:
- you have the private key of address A backed up somewhere 
- you send 1 out of 10 BTC from your address A to someone else's address B
- 9 of the 10 BTC get "changed" to your change address C
- a little later you want to reinstall your OS for example. you think your 9 BTC are still on address A. After your reinstall, you import the private key, only to find that the address is empty and that the private key for address C, where they actually are, is now forever lost.
This can only happen though if you don't export the whole wallet, like you're supposed to. If you're working with private keys to single addresses, you need to pay a little attention to that.

Thanks for the other information. But I still don't get it then.. If the transaction is not in the blockchain, and not in the mempool, "where" is it? How does the network "remember" it until the locktime is zero?
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:12:07
That is a complicated chapter and it involves predicting the future. So nobody can accurately give you an answer for that. 
Each block is 25 Bitcoins and there is 1 block every 10 minutes. Everybody in the business is competing over those.
You can't just get an asic-miner right now (or probably ever within the foreseeable future), they are only available by preorder months before production. Ordering them is a gamble on whether the company is trustworthy in actually delivering and whether the machine will still be able to pay itself off then, because the rewards are shrinking fast.
If you're new to the whole bitcoin scene, I wouldn't recommend getting into mining before you completely understand how the whole system works.

You're saying that any communication (or transaction in this case) over the internet can't be safe because "Big Brother is listening". Again: strong cryptography solves that, it makes listening on encrypted communication practically impossible.


Yes, it does. It **is** very hard to track. If you don't think so, please explain **how** you think it is being tracked.
If I send a transaction through the bitcoin system, it propagates through the network. No one getting the transaction knows if I was the original sender of the transaction or just someone passing it onward. For the NSA to know that, it would have to sit right outside of my router and catch the information as it is leaving my home. That is bullshit and it's not a level of surveillance that is either real or even possible.
There are arguably methods to statistically deduct the origin of a transaction by having tens of thousand of nodes in the network and estimating the origin, but that is far from easy and deserves a level of dedication to undermining the bitcoin network that I wouldn't attribute to the NSA. At least not yet. And as bitcoin grows, this becomes harder and harder.
The rest of your post still goes on about NFC and GPS stuff. I'm not trying to argue a case here that NFC is safe, so just drop it. If you want to paint a picture where every phone is compromised with government trojans and that everything you do is logged with your GPS coordinates or whatever, fine, that's **your** nice little conspiracy theory. But even if it was true, it still has nothing to do with bitcoin. You're basically just saying that nobody should use NFC or GPS or the internet at all.

Exactly. The whole scrypt thing just doesn't make any sense. There's also no reason why there wouldn't or couldn't be ASICs, the whole idea is stupid. You can produce dedicated hardware for every algorithm, it will always be better than a classic CPU.
And to add to that: It's good this way. If the average Joe could compete in the mining business, it would mean that the cost to take over the network by a big organization would be a lot smaller. ASICs help secure the network this way.

There isn't any confusion on my part. I'm very aware of how this works and how it plays out mathematecially. I know that the *expected value* is negative, I wasn't saying the opposite. That is true for **everything** in gambling that hasn't got to do with skill of any form (like poker). And thus it isn't even worth mentioning.
What I said was: "if you're not planning on doing it again and again and again, until you eventually lose, you actually have a very high chance of winning small amounts."
If I just plan to win **ONCE**, starting with 0.01 BTC and having a budget that allows to double 10 times, I have a chance of


of winning. 99.85% chance to win 0.01 BTC vs 0.15% chance to lose ALL. Now explain to me please how what I said is "fundamentally wrong". You have a high chance of winning a **small** amount, and you have a small chance of losing a **big** amount.

I think that is only the case because you just couldn't get porn for free twenty years ago. So the ratio is influenced by the huge amount of people who consume it for free now, but I'm sure the **absolute** number of people who pay for porn has increased.


I agree there. But that is already happening today. Porn is a lot of things. You don't just have to think about classic videos. Think live webcams for example. That's an already huge and growing market. And it is practically made for bitcoin. People pay/tip the girls already with "tokens" or whatever - make that bitcoin and there you go. It would also be a fantastic application for [micropayment channels]( (which is a feature of bitcoin that I think will come to heavy use at some point, even though the use currently is practically zero)
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:22:12


Well, that's the thing. The features of LTC and BTC are very similar, BTC is more adopted, so LTC is pointless. 
The features of BTC and PPC on the other hand are very different. PPC doesn't have a fixed upper limit, instead a fixed 1% inflation per year. This means a completely different currency already (I'm not saying better, I'm saying different). Then the minting doesn't work by traditional proof-of-work mining, which is another big difference. And I think solving the energy consumption problem is more important than you may think. Right now, it's maybe not so much of a problem. But if Bitcoin keeps growing, in the end there will be a big industry, that does nothing but waste **massive** amounts of energy on purpose for the security of the network.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:13:00
It's not that easy. Your other transactions won't propagate. If you send multiple transactions to the same nodes that spend the same outputs, they'll just reject them and not even bother putting them into a block. 
The only way it can work is that you basically split the network up into two parts, where one part believes you send the one transaction first, and the rest believes that you send the second transaction first. If the merchant then relies on a node that believes the second was the first, but the first gets taken into the next block, then you have a successful double spend. But you have little control over what nodes the merchant uses as reference. And if it's well connected nodes like blockchain.info, your chances are quite small. And making 9 additional transactions instead of just 1 does nothing at all here.

I don't get where you're coming from... What do you mean "the coins they have are worth more than the money they have"? That has nothing to do with it..


No, they take the fees from fiat too.
Say I want to buy bitcoins at mtgox, and deposit $1000. If I buy coins, someone else gets my $994 on their account - 0.6% fees for mtgox = $6 , which is their profit on the trade. They don't need to sell any coins to make that profit, it results directly from the trade.
If they in fact "go out to the bars after work and ball out on the company dime" (love the picture btw) and do that by using their depositors money, not the money they actually *own* in profit, they act criminal. Possible, sure, but I doubt it. It would be very, very stupid, and they would go to jail when it becomes public.

I have made a bunch of purchases with bitcoin (for example the Nexus 7 that lies next to me here), but I use them mostly to just increase the amount I own, mainly by betting on the right securities/stocks. Thus I don't even really care if the bitcoin price itself increases, for all I care it could stay where it is forever. Since I got into bitcoin, the number I have has increased by about 5x, without putting in any additional fiat, just by betting on the right stocks/securities. There are great investment opportunities in bitcoin. It's all high risk and you have to do a good amount of research and have a good instinct on what you can trust and what you can't, but it is definitely exciting and can be really rewarding. There were times where I was sitting in front of the screen, literally shaking in excitment, making more money in minutes than I make on my job in months. It's a dangerous game, but it's very fun. I would recommend trying it out to anyone, it has been a very good experience for me so far. Just start slowly, put in I dunno, 50 bucks or whatever isn't too much for you. Then go on from there and let it happen naturally.
For the matter of getting bitcoins, it depends on where you are. If you're in the U.S., I see people recommending Coinbase a lot. If you're in the EU, I can recommend bitcoin.de or bitstamp.net

This annoying verification crap is what the government forces the exchanges to do, otherwise they get screwed for not complying with anti-money-laundering regulation. You're correct to be angry about it, because it's bullshit. But it is as it is. If you want more anonymous coins, you have 3 alternatives:
- buy them from someone you meet in person ([localbitcoins]( or via something like [bitcoin-otc]( - always be careful and apply common sense though. There are scammers everywhere.
- use a mixing service like [blockchain.info's shared send]( to launder your coins after you buy them at an exchange
- mine them yourselves. It doesn't get more anonymous than that, but it's hardly an option if you just want to buy some coins.

No, that is wrong. The price of bitcoin doesn't matter (except for covering the electricity cost, but that is no important factor here).

Miners try to "solve" a block. When a miner solves a block, he gets the usual block reward (25 Bitcoins at the moment) **plus** all the fees from the transactions he puts into the block. Since he can decide which transactions he puts into his block, so transactions with higher fees are usually given higher priority. That's the way the fee system is designed to work.

You can't. Your brother who tried it didn't make any money (not even .3 cents an hour), because the electricity he used in the process was probably more expensive than what he earned in bitcoins.

The only thing that means is that your investment in **bitcoin** was a success. BITCOIN has gone up in price, and THAT is the reason you could make your money back. If you just had bought bitcoins, you would have the same effect. If I just buy bitcoin, but no miner, and bitcoin goes up in price, would you think it's logical for me to say my non-existant miner was a success?? No! Bitcoin was a success.
People, it is *really*, *really* **that** simple: The fiat amount you put in your miner doesn't matter at all for a proper calculation. The only thing to consider is ROI for bitcoin. If your estimation shows that you won't reach ROI in form of bitcoins, just buy bitcoins instead.
Aside from that, these waste-of-money-sticks can only be bought with bitcoin, so even the people like you who like to fall for this logical fallacy can't seriously consider them a good investment.

Yeah there's really no blaming AM in my opinion. They operate fairly and honestly, which is really not something you can say about the other ASIC producers so far (BFL, Avalon). 
But being the only company that has proven honest and gets to sell from stock, they have a monopoly that is not good. If there was just ONE other company that would compete with them for prices, buying ASICs for private use would look a lot fairer than it does right now. But there are others coming up that will fill that role.

It's not a matter of whether you're *keeping* it in the exchange. You can have a wire on its way to the exchange or a withdraw pending, whatever. The point is that it's not good if an exchange is constantly running on the risk of being suddenly shut down. 
Lots of people, including friends of mine, got burned when bitcoin-24 went down. And they hadn't all naively kept money in the exchange for extended periods of time. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:42:35
Thanks for your answer, you're making interesting points.
But don't you think that the 2nd approach (unlimited blocks) could also result in problems with fees/the mining incentive? When block rewards decrease (and eventually completely disappear), the reason for people to keep mining are only the fees. If there is basically no necessity for people to pay decent fees (since there's always room in a block for your transaction), I'm not sure the reward will be high enough for miners to keep the hashrate, i.e. the security of the network, high.

Well, I don't use online wallets, but I didn't mean switch from blockchain.info to a different one. If any online wallet, you should use that. I just meant create a new wallet (account) there and use that for the future.
The problem is that before they added this verification via email, it was possible for hackers to download your wallet if they knew (or guessed) your id. The wallet that they could download was still encrypted with your password, but they can try to bruteforce it offline this way. There is a big difference in difficulty for a hacker to bruteforce something that is online on a server contrary to something they have on their own computer. When they send millions of different login attempts to a server, their ip just gets banned. On their own machines, nothing can stop them. If the password is safe ( &gt; 20 in length, with lower+upper case + numbers + special characters), they'll probably still never break it. But as we know, that's not how typical users choose their passwords...

Well not quite. Say someone buys bitcoin for fiat, then buys a TV with those bitcoin, then the merchant immediately sells them for fiat again. That will just basically do nothing to the bitcoin economy. Neither good nor bad.
Optimally, people will just take bitcoin as payment and buy their own stuff with it - you know, really use it like a currency. But we're just not there yet, so a service like bitcoin is a necessity for merchants right now. It's good that it exist, it allows the economy to grow, until it hits the point where merchants start to say "hell, why am I even converting them back, I can buy everything I need with them"

I don't quite see the point of this. Why does it need to be "a plugin for bitcoin miner"? If i understand correctly, you want to do something entirely different with the computation power than bitcoin mining. What you want to build is SETI payed with Bitcoins by researchers.

Yet, still, it can be done. Which means the "problem" is only shifted. If LTC were to grow enough, it would happen. It's really just that it doesn't have a point if you think it to the end.
I put "problem" in quotation marks because I don't see it as a problem. Litecoin folks are arguing that it's better to have no ASICs or FPGAs, which I think is just wrong. We're at the most critical stage now, where they are rare and it can be said that they hold too much power compared to the rest of the network. But that's really just now. When they spread to more and more consumers, as it's happening now, this will even out. And the great benefit is that botnet abuse of GPUs and CPUs for mining will become less and less profitable due to this, which is a very good thing.

No, he really means what I said. He's not denying proof-of-work in general, that would be really bananas, it's the foundation of bitcoin.
And yes, you can design ASICs for scrypt too. Like I said, his point isn't really valid. The thing with scrypt or other memory-hard functions is that it would be costlier to produce ASICs, but definitely not impossible. "Memory-hard" already says it - the chips would need more memory to work, which would add to the cost. But be it as it may, it would at one point still get profitable to produce them, and then it would happen. Also, if it's possible to produce them, just not lucrative, that's another thing - an attacker on the network wouldn't care about profitability, he might produce the ASICs just to destroy bitcoin.
tl;dr: our hashing function is fine, bitcoin is fine, ASICs are fine.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:59:22
In bitcoin, on a technical level, there aren't any "balances" saved. What you see as a positive balance on an address, is only "unspent outputs" on that address. Unspent output means an output that is send to this address, but not yet used as an input for another transaction.
In your example, let's say that A received its initial balance of 10 via 5 transactions à 2 btc. That means A has 5 unspent outputs at 2 btc each.  
If now A wants to send 3 btc to B, it takes 2 of those unspent outputs and uses them as the input for a new transaction (totalling 4 btc). That new transaction has 2 outputs, 1 output of 3 btc to B, and 1 output of 1 back to A (or to a change address in control of A's owner).  
So now these 3 btc are **one** of the unspent outputs on B. And if **that** output is used as a new input in another transaction, it is clear that exactly **these** coins came from A originally.

Another important thing to consider here: Someone could argue that the network doesn't actually measures computational speed, it basically just estimates it given the current luck in finding blocks. 
So theoretically, if by an astronomically unlikely streak of luck, the next 2016 blocks are found each just 1 second from each other, the difficulty would have to increase by a HUGE factor, and thus making finding the next blocks practically impossible. 
This is prohibited though by the fact that the difficulty increase is capped at a factor of 4. So huge jumps in difficulty that would make mining impossible can simply not happen, it can *at worst* get 4x harder than it was before.

Many agree on that there's only 2 possible outcomes for the whole bitcoin experiment: either it will find great mainstream adoption, which would cause the price to explode (then $1000 per coin is nothing).

Buying a miner is essentially **nothing else** than buying bitcoin, just with the intention of getting more bitcoin out of it than you paid for it. It's not dinner or a pizza or any other item. When you're buying a miner, you're already buying bitcoin.

That needs to be worked out by the market by itself though. Knowing that there are just 1 million bitcoin available wouldn't have an effect on the price if there are just 10 people who want to buy any. The price just reflects supply and demand.

Yeah, of course it's a bot. But this one only buys, and buys and buys. I have watched it live, eat up at least 500 btc while I was watching and there was no selling going on, whatsoever. That's not a bot programmed to do some usual trading algorithm, it's just a bot that is supposed to do delayed buying - which can make sense. If you want to buy 10k btc, you better not buy it at once, you would increase the market price by way too much. So you buy it in increments. I think that's what I'm seeing here.

Only a fool sells bitcoin for credit card. That is because credit card payments are reversible, while bitcoin payments are not.
The only options that I know off to get bitcoins without proving your identity in some way is by paying cash, in person, like with localbitcoins, or use something like [bitcoin-otc]( You're probably going to pay a little bit more than market price though.
You shouldn't think though that proving your identity to buy coins is "ruining the whole point of bitcoin". That's not true. There is friction when getting bitcoin for fiat money, but that is a problem on the fiat side. Once you'll have your coins, there's free sailing from then on.

Looking at the % increase of the past really doesn't predict the future. 
To go from $10 to $100, the market cap of bitcoin had to increase by &gt;$900m (which was already a lot, no doubt). To go from $100 to $1000, it has to increase by a whopping $10 billion. That just won't happen easily, that's **a lot** of money that has to flow into this young market. You can disagree of course, but I stand by my statement that going from 100 to 1000 is a very different thing than going from 10 to 100. And going from 1000 to 10000 will be even more of a stretch.

The more bitcoin is worth, the more energy will be put into mining them. The energy costs rise proportionally with bitcoin price so that there is a near equilibrium in mining cost &lt;-&gt; mining profit. And that is completely unrelated to how efficient the machines are that do the mining. It makes no difference if everyone uses ASICs or everyone uses CPUs.
Right now, due to the invention of bitcoin ASICs and the explosive increase in bitcoin value, we are far, far from that equilibrium. But you better believe that it won't stay that way forever. To me, energy use is **the** drawback of bitcoin, and a good argument for proof of stake coins like PPCoin. But it's arguable that even the high energy use for bitcoin will be still just a fraction of what is wasted in today's traditional banking.

As far as I know, for small amounts (I think &lt; 0.01 btc), a fee is **enforced**, so you're not allowed to even try this.
You could basically flood the few nodes of the network that you're connected to with such invalid transactions without a fee, but they would just disregard it and not propagate it through the network. So you could basically just try to DOS single nodes with this, not the whole network. And to do this, you wouldn't need to use invalid transactions, you could just DOS them with traditional methods that have nothing to do with bitcoin. The reaction will be the same in the end: they ignore your IP.

This is not a little "change of plans", it means murdering another human. Someone who is so anti-violence doesn't just do that because it fits his plans.

And it's not like he was completely "back into a corner", come on. Ridiculous. He could have just payed the guy off. Before I believe that he hired to kill him, I'll believe that it was a trick DPR played to convince the guy that he *would* do that to make him back off.
Believe what you want. If you want to believe that everything DPR has been preaching these years he completely pulled out of his ass, and that all his deliberate anti-violence statements on his public profiles as Ulbricht were also complete nonsense and that instead, he was one big sociopath stringing this whole community along for his evil game - go ahead.

There is really nothing so special about what bitpay does that a little script you include yourself couldn't save you the 1% fee.
Additionally, they use the weighted average for calculation of the price, which means they take additional profit in the form of slippage. Your own program would of course not have that problem. And depending on how good your program's logic is, you could even always find the exchange with the best price and sell there.

Since most "miners" in this case (as in entities that have to publish a solved block) are pools, that is surely right. But since they are well connected, they also have to upload it a lot more times. And for private miners, no. 120kb/s upstream is well above average. 
Anyway, my point is made. It doesn't take "a fraction of a percent" more time. It takes exactly the percentage more time that the size gets bigger. If you have 200kb to upload instead of 100kb, it takes double the time. If that is still negligible, fine. But it's not so little as to write it off as completely irrelevant. If we reach 1MB blocksize and it turns out that 80% of the transactions people send are without fees, I as a miner would start filtering them out, saving 80% of my bandwith.

Absolutely this. Nobody who actually followed what has happened seriously thinks there was any fraud going on by Simon. But one of the main reasons that probably no one will see their money again is that some jackasses couldn't wait a few days for some clarifications and had to file unjustified charges. Now all the money is in the hands of the wrong people (banks, state, police) and it will take forever to clear all this up - by then, there will be nothing left of the money to go back to the customers.
I have next to zero hope by now that this will all end peacefully. It could have, but that point has passed. These things have happened thousands of times, and they always end the same. All the money gets lost in the legal system.
And yes, I just really fucking hope that there will be charges filed against the banks etc that caused all this mess, because they deserve a punishment. Simon acted like a complete idiot here, but that doesn't mean those assholes can just take millions of his customers.

Feathercoin (as Litecoin's slightly more retarded little brother) uses a different hashing algorithm than Bitcoin, the hashrate is lower there. I'd estimate that to compare it to Bitcoin, you need to multiply by about 1000. It's still not much though.
So even if it relates to 2 TH in Bitcoin - to do that attack on Bitcoin you'd need about 40 times that hashrate. And to get to that hashrate in Bitcoin would cost A LOT more than 40 times the money - and that is actually the only variable that counts here: not how much hashrate you need, but how much money you need.

Not quite. That would mean it would get easier and easier, since difficulty goes up. To be precise, the hash has to be lower than the **target**. The **difficulty** on the other hand is calculated as:
*difficulty = maximum_possible_target / current_target*
That way, with the value of current target going down, difficulty goes up.

I honestly don't know why they're so cheap right now. I have a good amount of money sitting there, expecting that to eventually change.
There are some unanswered questions in the thread right now about their chip specs, some people are running around yelling that it's a scam, I *guess* it's stuff like this that keeps the price low. 
But I'm near 100% sure they are not a scam. That is because when they held their IPO, they had the chance to make *a lot* of extra coins by holding it auction-style, since there was very high demand for their shares. They would have probably gotten double of what they were orginially asking for, but they took the high road and dealt with the IPO in the most fair way for everyone. I just can't possibly see how a scammer would have not used that opportunity, it wouldn't make any sense.
So I basically exclude the risk of them being a scam. They might still be incompetent though, right now there's not much to evaluate if that's the case or not. The whole situation will have cleared up in about 1-2 months. They will either have a working product by then and the share price will go up, or they'll have nothing to show and the price will plummet below IPO price.

I just got a login-attempt-mail at my blockchain.info account too. This seems to be a bigger thing.








Here's my guess at what's happening: Someone has a large database of hacked email addresses (there are plenty of those). They can't directly know though which of these is connected to a mtgox account. So they wordlist-bruteforce password resets on mtgox and check all the hacked email accounts for the reset mail. With blockchain.info, the strategy might be that the password of the hacked email account might be the same as for the blockchain account. 
Just a wild guess, but in every scenario, I'd say as long as you're sure your email-account isn't compromised, you're safe. That many people can now not access their mtgox accounts anymore is probably just because mtgox detected this mass-password-reset and disabled the accounts just to be sure. I'm sure we'll know more about it soon.

If you just want to hold them, put them in cold storage (that means offline). Print a [paper wallet]( (which is just the private key to a bitcoin address, printed out) and send the coins there. Make a few copies and store them in different places (in case you lose one or your house burns down or whatever).
The best approach in my opinion is to put the biggest part of your stash in cold storage like this, but keep some online for playing around with all the services, investments and so on that bitcoin offers.

No, that is a completely unrelated thing. Buying bitcoins and a bitcoin miner is essentially the same thing. Just that with one of them, in the end, you have **more** bitcoins. If that one is a miner, it was a good investment, otherwise, it was not.
This is really so goddamn easy, every time I explain this stupid, stupid thing I feel like I'm talking to a bunch of children. And still, it comes up again and again and again. There is no sense in calculating mining ROI in anything except bitcoins. Period. This has nothing to do with "Yeah, if I could predict the future I coulda woulda". 
You're doing 1 of 2 things: you're either buying bitcoins, or you're buying "future" bitcoins (in form of a miner). Either way, you're buying bitcoins. And if you're buying bitcoins in form of a miner, and that miner doesn't make as many bitcoins as you could have bought in the first place, then it's bad. Then it **doesn't ROI**.

If someone was stupid(!) enough to sell hundreds of thousands of bitcoins to the market at once, yes that would induce a panic, and the price would plummet. But it would change absolutely **nothing** about bitcoin. Bitcoin would still be a great frictionless global payment system, etc, etc. The price would be low and then it would start rising again, with all of these hundreds of thousands of bitcoins having been redistributed between more people, which is a good thing.
There were times when a bitcoin was worth less than $0.01, and it was still alive back then. And no one selling any amount of coins could even push it back to anywhere near that price.
If someone would sell 1 million bitcoins to the market at once, he would get what, maybe 5-10 million dollars? That's **nothing**, and it would certainly not kill bitcoin. All it would be is a very stupid move by someone who could have made a lot more money.

This is the litecoin way of thinking, and it is wrong. 
The whole premise of his line of thought is that if we have a CPU/GPU based network that uses an "ASIC-resistant" hashing function (which it even isn't actually), we're safer from a 51% attack. I don't know why this would be true, because it simply isn't. 
If someone got millions of dollar together, instead of building enough ASICs to take over the network (which is only possible right now because ASICs are still young and rare), he could just as well build a huge CPU farm that does the same. The only reason this would be dangerous is if the ASIC market wouldn't grow, and no one except one corporation would be able to have them. Admittedly, we're at a dangerous point there right now, because really only a few people have them. But that is shifting. As the ASIC industry grows, there will be more and more security. On the other hand, if you have a CPU-based network, all it takes is a few people with a large enough botnet, and they got the currency by the balls.

There is a difference between "too technical" and "wrong". It's important to give correct information, or you end up with a bunch of confused people who don't know what to believe.
And no, it's not too technical to say that a wallet holds the keys with which you can unlock your bitcoin addresses. Describing how bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography in combination with a proof of work system to secure the network, that would be too technical.
What an address and a wallet is, that's the bare minimum someone has to understand to use bitcoin. It's not that difficult, and methaphors work great: start with explaining a bitcoin address by saying that it's like a mailbox (you can send funds too it, but only the person with the key can take them out) and then explain a wallet by saying that it's a keychain for a bunch of mailboxes.

Nah, your thought process there is wrong, because you assume it's somehow important whether hashrate is more expensive or not. That is incorrect, it only matters seen relative to the rest. 
Security in cryptocurrencies is not defined as "how many hashes are produced in total", but rather "how much money/effort/energy would it take to overturn the network". If some PoW function makes it 1000x more expensive per hash, you basically have the same network security at 1000x less hashes.

Yeah, I didn't mean they'd go for a full day, or hundreds of blocks in a row without finding one. They could just start multiple attempts, spread over time, no?
But I see your point and you're right, of course. It's not likely to pull this off with 25%. The most important point against that is that every failed attempt would cost them quite a bit of money. But I wasn't really focussed on the 25% part, just on the part where you said it's unlikely no one of their users would notice if they were hiding blocks. Give them close to 50% of the hashpower and I can definitely see them sneaking in double spend attempts without anyone figuring it out before it's too late.

The concept you have to understand is that bitcoins are never physically "on" your computer, or "on" a paper wallet. Bitcoins are by nature always a part of the network. All that you store on your computer, or on paper, or in your mind, are the keys to **access** the coins. But they always **exist** in the network.
So you can have as many copies of the keys that you want, and they can always access the same coins. When someone says he "owns" X bitcoins, what he means is he owns keys that accesses addresses that hold X bitcoins.

Just not comply with the regulations. How bitcoin works as a medium of exchange is not in any way impaired by these exchange regulations. If the government bans exchanges -&gt; Trade freely for goods and services, just not for fiat exchange. Trade for fiat in person, or via arrangements in chat rooms, web forums, whatever. And if they make that illegal, *fine*, do it illegally.
The only reason for embracing the regulations is because of the promise of faster mainstream adoption and thus a faster increasing price for bitcoin. I personally don't give much of a fuck if we get to $1000 valuation sooner than later, if we have to sell our soul in the process.

Even if it is never used as a currency, it's still a great Gold v2.0.

Uhm, no. I think this was the thought of dooglus at first too, but it's not correct. The balance left in the account was virtual, there were no btc backing it. The site said "We have 10,000 BTC now" (this gets split up between all investors), but in reality there were just 8,700. It's just a matter of correcting the site's number back to 8,700. No one of the investors is losing profit that was ever real.


What do you mean by that? There is no real manipulating here. You gamble against a pool of investments from other people. If you win, you take out of that pool, and if you lose, you pay into it. So losing fake money into the pool isn't something that hurts much, because it can be easily reversed.
The only problem here were the people who had their money withdrawn in between this mess. They could take out a bit more profit than they were really entitled too. But iirc, that wasn't a lot and easily coverable, compared to covering imaginary 1300 btc.

They hash all transactions which they want to take into the block, including one transaction to themselves for the block reward, plus a "secret number". If the resulting hash meets certain criteria, it is a valid block and they publish the block. The other miners can validate the result by.just doing one hash.
If the hash is not valid, the miner tries again with the next secret number.
As you see, which transactions make it into a block is completely the miner's decision. But obviously, they are sorted by fee, because the fees also go to the miner

So? How is that hurtful? Bitcoin is hardly a "currency" at the moment. It's a commodity, like gold, that has some major advantages over gold though, for example that it can move freely, frictionless over the whole world. Even if bitcoin is never used as a "currency" in day to day transactions, it's still a fantastic gold 2.0. 
Do you think people are "hurting gold" by "hoarding" it? This kind of argument makes no sense. People are not hurting bitcoin by hoarding it. They are just doing with it what they think is best to do with it. And that's good.
I think it's great if people use bitcoin to buy stuff, but it's also great if they buy it as a store of value. Bitcoin is what people use it for, and that's about all there is to say.

That doesn't really explain the need for registration. Most bitcoin gambling sites allow just sending coins to an address to deposit without the need to sign up for an account. 
The player is then logged in via his session (cookies) and can return to the session via a unique secret URL. Look at how just-dice or satoshicircle do it.
I think you should really look into how to get this to work. Often, the little act of making an account is the step that stops players from getting started. 
Also, if you keep it the way it is, change the wording at the top from "Sign-In" to "Sign up". Sign-In = Login

It is **designed to be deflationary one day** but that's still far away in the future. Currently, it has quite a high inflation of more than 10% a year. Currently, a rise in price of bitcoin is not due to its deflationary nature, only due to increased adoption.

No it is not. The dollar, like bitcoin, is backed by nothing. People just misuse the term "backed" like they want to explain why TO THEM, something is worth something. But "backed" means you are guaranteed you can exchange it for something that has a value to you. When the dollar was backed by gold, you could exchange it for a certain amount of gold. Now it is backed by nothing, period. Not "by the government", not "by violence".

Many predictable parts add exactly the amount of bits of entropy that they add. I know you know this so I don't know why we're arguing over it. 


Yes, and if you have 1000 parts with two options each, that's 1000 bits worth of security. If you say "many predictable parts doesn't make a strong password", by "many" you just mean 20 and a symbol that can only be 1 of 2?
My point is that every password is made up of single predictable parts. Each symbol on its own is predictable. So, always, the ONLY way to get a strong password is to combine many predictable parts into one that is hard to predict.

As contracts are among the most fascinating things about bitcoin, I urge everyone to check out these two easy implementations to understand the concept:

FAZ is one of the most popular German newspapers. Here's the relevant part about bitcoin, run through Google Translate:






The whole thing is designed so that the amount of Bitcoins expands slowly and there is an absolute upper limit. Who draws the Bitcoins ("mining" call the internet people, so "promote" such as gold mining) can collect the profit from the "seigniorage". For the use of Bitcoins but is only essential that they are scarce, so do not be increased at will, that they can purchase at a rate against euro, dollar or yen, which depends on supply and demand, and that there are places that they accept as money.




So, basically, just the usual stuff.

The word is "paranoid" .... just kidding. That kind of mindset is necessary when dealing with bitcoin.
The thing with bitaddress.org and similar sites is that you actually don't have to trust them. All the address generation code is completely client-side, so it just happens on *your* computer, nothing is happening on their server. So they simply can't know what you're doing. You can either verify that yourself by reviewing the sourcecode of the page, or trust that others have sufficiently done so already.

I'd really like it if someone would develop an open source solution that does basically what bitpay does. It shouldn't be too hard IMO. Correct me if I'm wrong, but all that's done here is
- receive money on merchant address
- move bitcoin to exchange address
- sell bitcoin on exchange
- done
To make up for the time the bitcoin are waiting for confirmation, all you need is a buffer of, let's say, 100 BTC on the exchange.
If that software was available, and it should be no more than just a little script, merchants could just implement it themselves and not have to pay even the 1% fee from bitpay or any other of these services.

You still don't understand it. 
The decision is not "Hmm do I buy a car or do I buy a nice TV with my money?". It is "Hmm, do I buy Bitcoins, or do I buy Bitcoins?". Buying a miner is nothing else than buying "future" bitcoins. Think about it - it is the same thing. The only reason to buy a miner instead of direct bitcoins is that you expect the miner to return more bitcoins than what you could buy in bitcoins directly.

It's not a disadvantage. China's engine of growth is export. If they keep their own currency artificially low compared to the US (where most of their exported goods go), they make more money (better "value") in the long run.
So today if one dollar is equal to 7 yuans and a Chinese exporter sells a shirt for 10 dollars, he gets 70 yuans. However, if the value of one dollar were to be only 5 yuans (after the yuan is allowed to reach its real value), the exporter would only get 50 yuans.

I think supporting alt-coins, that do nothing actually different than bitcoin, is bad. It "waters down" bitcoin. That's why I'm not even speculating on those same-coins, I don't want to support something that I don't believe contains actual change.
I hold a few PPCoin and Namecoin. In my opinion, they're the only coins that actually do something different (PPCoin) or are for a different purpose (Namecoin). I think they're both very interesting. Not only doesn't PPCoin rely heavily on energy "waste" like bitcoin does, it has a slow, constant, never-ending automatic inflation, which in my layman's opinion is more in line with current popular economic beliefs. If that's really the way to go, who knows? But it's certainly a valid alternative.
From the rest of the alt-coins, I think only litecoin is even debatable as an alternative. And I think it doesn't hold up. Using scrypt as a hashing algo, it promises things that will simply not play out like the people following it are thinking it will. It was originally designed so people couldn't use it well on GPUs (not just FPGAs or ASICs), it was meant to give the power back to the CPUs. Today, if you mine Litecoin, you better do it on a GPU... Now they're talking about being ASIC-resistant, but that's the same thing... nothing is "ASIC-resistant"... yes, it would be more costly to produce ASICs with more memory, but so what? That only shifts the "problem"! If Litecoin were to grow and grow, a few years later you'd be at the point where it would still become profitable to produce ASICs for Litecoin. And then what? Wouldn't the whole point of the currency be null and void?
And even more importantly, it opens up the possibility to destroy litecoin by doing this. If everyone is running the hashing on CPUs, it takes one company (or government or whatever you might be afraid of) to produce a small batch of efficient ASICs to destroy the currency. In an ASIC-run economy like where Bitcoin is headed, that's not as easy, given that access to ASICs is easy enough for the masses. Granted, right now that is somewhat limited, but that means just that we are at the absolutely most critical point right now, from here on it will just even out. That's why I strongly disagree with the premise that we should somehow try to find ways to avoid ASICs, I think they're a good thing.

All the mining stocks plan to *eventually* pay dividends, but it takes a lot of work first to engineer and produce their own ASICs.
Most current speculation is just a gamble on whether they will be successful. *If* they are and start paying decent dividends, the price of the stock will definitely explode, which is why it *can* be a very good investment.
But just as a general hint.. don't throw your money into something that you don't know in and out. Before you invest in a bitcoin stock,  better make sure to completely read and understand their plans on bitcointalk. Often enough, scams make it to the exchanges, and a bit of common sense when reading their claims is often enough to identify the scam.

If you have 20 BTC from one input on adress A, and you send someone 0.5BTC to address B, the one input is split up into two outputs, one 19.5 BTC and one 0.5 BTC. The 0.5 BTC go to B, while the 19.5 BTC go back to you. But on most clients and in the default configuration, this "change" doesn't go back to address A (the one that sends it), but to a new one, a "change address" C.
If you're always using the same wallet, you won't notice that, because it doesn't matter. The wallet holds all your addresses and handles this automatically. But if you're exporting the private key from address A, to make a paper wallet or a brainwallet or something like that, you may find that your money is not on this address anymore, which can be confusing, and really dangerous in case that you threw the other addresses or the wallet away, because you thought there is nothing in it.
I'm kind of tired, but I hope that made some sense.

Yeah, **if**. But they can't do both at the same time. That's not how this stuff works. You could be using your GPU to mine bitcoins, and your CPU to perform research, for example, but then my point still stands and this could and should be a seperate program.

It means you register a special bitcoin bank account at a specific bank (which one is not decided yet). The funds you have in that account are linked to bitcoin.de, so you can have real-time trades for bitcoin with the money in that account. And you can of course easily use the account as a normal bank account.
If they really pull it off, this is a genius solution. You win, bitcoin.de wins, the bank wins. 
And as the site's owner is a known, experienced professional - contrary to bitcoin-24 or the like - I have high hopes that bitcoin.de might become Europe's new exchange  We **really** need something like this.

No, he hasn't. The time he mines with them is only so important. If difficulty rises enough, it will be too high for him to **ever** reach ROI within his lifetime. If he got these for 1 btc each (I really hope he didn't buy for 2), he is looking at a ROI of about 5 months *right now*. But within these 5 months, difficulty will keep skyrocketing, putting his goal of ROI further and further away. 
If difficulty is 10x from what it is now (and *believe me*, that won't take too long with all the ASICs hitting the market this year), he's looking at making **~0.02 bitcoin per month**.
Nah, really man, there is no likely scenario where these things will **ever** pay for themselves. Just play a bit with a mining calculator and some conservative estimates on difficulty, and you'll see for yourself.

Yawn. No, that is not a problem with the code and definitely not a random collision. The address belongs to this guy and no one else. 
Bitcoin-qt holds a buffer of about 100 addresses that are pre-generated (so you don't have to redo your backups whenever you generate a new address). What happened here most likely is something like this:
- Guy does a backup of his wallet, puts it on an USB stick.
- Keeps using his wallet, generates this address A (which comes from the buffer), puts coins on it and from it.
- At some time, he has to use his backed up wallet. The address A is already in this, but only in the buffer.
- He generates a new address in the client, and the same address A comes up that he used before (taken from the buffer). He think "woaah my god address collision wtf" and posts it to bitcointalk.
This happens all the time, because people don't know what they are doing when using bitcoin-qt. And if you ask me, the principle that bitcoin-qt uses here is quite stupid. Stuff like this is why I'd never recommend using it to newbies (or anyone, really). Anyway, at no point was he getting access to the address of someone else than himself.
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:49:43
It doesn't matter what it was paid with. It's the same thing if it's paid in bitcoin, dollars, rubies or pink turtles. It generates bitcoin, so the profit has to be calculated in bitcoin. If it cost 4600 btc to buy it at that time, then it has to return 4600 btc, otherwise you could have just bought 4600 btc at the time and would now have more! It doesn't matter with what you **actually** pay it, that is the way you have to calculate whether it makes more sense to buy it or just to buy bitcoin. In every thread connected to mining, people show this misconception that the fiat price is at all relevant. It's not. Wrap your head around it.

It's not what I'm discussing. They can sell 1000 machines for pre-order, produce 10,000 and just hold the 1000 back while they mine with the 9000.
You have to know, the difficult part about building ASICs is the start - the initial investment, the development of the chip, setting up the infrastructure etc. When they have that, production is cheap. When they are as far as being able to make 100, it's no problem at all to make much much more.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:29:47
Yeah that's really low, not worth the effort I'm afraid (but you know that yourself). If you're just doing it for fun, that's really cool, but you might want to not go for litecoin... I can feel the downvotes already coming, but here is why: I think LTC are pointless. They offer basically nothing that BTC doesn't offer, just a bunch of pseudo arguments. You should rather check out [PPCoin]( [here's a pool]( if you want to mine something interesting aside from Bitcoin. They actually have a different concept that might play out well. Maybe you want to look into that.
Another warning, even though that's probably not very likely... there have been reports from people who have actually fried their laptops by mining. Sometimes the cooling in them is just not made to be doing heavy work for extended periods of time, and while the hardware should be secured against just killing itself, apparently, it happens.

My thoughts exactly when I read that image. While the limits mentioned here apply to classical computing, quantum computing is a thing that works differently and could destroy bitcoin.
Roughly said, it wouldn't need to "brute force" hash, it would just instantly give the right answer, having run through infinite possible combinations immediately. Strange quantum physics at play.
But not only bitcoin would be affected by this. The whole security systems of the internet and everything digital would become instantly useless. There would be great applications for the future, but it would completely turn our current digital world upside down.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:01:13
Arbitrage is certainly possible, I've done it many times and made good money with it.
The problem with doing arbitrage here is that bitcoin moves fast, while fiat moves slow. The best thing is to have fiat ready on multiple different exchanges so you can use the opportunities when they arise. But if you're doing that, you're exposing yourself to other risks, like the exchanges going down/getting hacked. I luckily dodged the bullet in April, when Bitcoin-24 went belly up, but others lost big amounts of money there.

There's a good chance that never, yes, really. Every altcoin that appears has to go a long way before it can surpass btc, and you have to keep in mind that bitcoin is not set in stone. Innovations that an altcoin comes up with could be implemented into btc long before the alt becomes even remotely popular. That is only not true if the alt is completely and fundamentally different from bitcoin. But nothing like that is around so far, or even planned.

ASICMINER is deploying 200 TH/s in the coming weeks. And other companies are probably not sleeping either.
By the time you'll have your product from this fraudulent company (if you ever will), difficulty will be 20x from now and it will be barely profitable. You'll make your money back in two years if you're lucky.

KnCMiner's ASICs have ~1 W/GH/s, so 0.001kW/GH/s.
1 GH at current difficulty needs about 29086 hours to produce 1 BTC, so about 29 kWh of electricity.
=&gt; 1 BTC (worth $800+) is produced for 29 * $.15 = $4.35
The problem is that you have to pay off the high costs for the machine first for it be profitable.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:05:53


Yes, sure. Just since this increases in value so fast at the moment. It would be exactly the same for a stock that behaves the same.


Tough to say actually. I'm glad I already *have* my coins for a while and can watch everything happen relatively relaxed. Anyway, I'd say *yes* it still is a good time to buy, and it will probably continue to be a good time to buy for at least a few years... it's just possible that you have to be patient. If you buy coins and then a big correction happens, the worst and most stupid thing you can do is sell in panic. I have a friend who after hearing from me about bitcoin, bought in during the last bubble in April, at the worst possible time, around $240. A day or so later, it crashed. But he didn't sell (because I told him he should just hold onto it) and now it has completely recovered and he is well in profit.

The problem wasn't with the website (JAVA website) you went to, the problem is that you executed the JAVA plugin on whatever site you were before (my educated guess would be ... porn). When you do that, you're basically allowing the app to do everything it wants, including riddling your computer with malware. That's why it has to ask for your permission before it runs. Next time, just say no.
For getting rid of it, to be honest, I'd just reinstall windows. Doesn't take that long and only then you can be sure that you really got rid of *everything* and don't have a trojan left on your system that will just put the next malware on it in a while.

A bitcoin (or a private key) is not an oil field that doesn't belong to anyone initially. Every bitcoin, from the moment of its creation, belongs to someone. If you take it from someone else, that's theft. You're not discovering wild unclaimed bitcoins if you take someone else's private key. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 17:13:41
I don't know what you're trying to say. That bitcoin is not fully anonymous? We all know that. But it's anonymous in the way that I can send you coins and you don't know who I am. You don't have any information of me except the address where the coins I sent you come from.
The NSA spying on everything you do on the internet has nothing to with bitcoin. The NSA doing that is the problem, and bitcoin is not trying to solve that problem. But it's a fact that bitcoin transactions are secured by strong cryptography, the NSA can't just circumvent that, as in: they can't just steal your bitcoins.


That is false, where did you get that? Logged by whom? Bitcoin doesn't log any IP addresses.


So? It's a public method, there is no "backdoor" in it, you're just making up a conspiracy theory that there is. There is no basis for that argument. Learn how SHA-256 works and then tell me please what that "backdoor" looks like.


What the hell has any of that to do with bitcoin?
I agree that paranoia is probably the best approach in these things, but you're jumping to really strange conclusions that don't make any sense to me. I'd also agree that cash is still the best way to do anonymous value transfers, but there are many problems with that, biggest of all being that it's not fast and easy, you can't just send cash around the world in a few minutes. Bitcoin is a great way to  do that. Here's an anonymous transaction: I buy bitcoins with cash, I send bitcoins to a friend on the other side of the world, he turns them into cash again. Done.

I'm pretty sure every more or less nifty hacker would code himself something for that if he's planning to swap between coins. I'm sure I would (I'm not mining at all currently though). I don't know if there's some free software for that.
Shouldn't be too complicated, just fetch the most profitable coin from a list like  and tell your software to mine that. Just a matter of stopping the current miner and starting the one for the other coin. Gets a little more interesting if you have to synchronize a whole network of different miners, and I guess there's lots of optimization possible to make the swapping more fluent so you don't lose time between swaps... but basically, it's not that difficult.

Have you tried investing in a real stock with dollars? It's complicated.  It's regulated. You fill out a lot of forms, and you don't have direct access to everything. With bitcoin, you make an account on a bitcoin stock exchange, like [btct.co]( send bitcoins there, and you're good to go.
Of course, the fact that it is practically unregulated at the moment, also means there are a lot of scams and fraud going on. With bitcoin, you always have to be very, very careful what you're investing in, because people can easily take your money and run.

Hm, I'm not sure what you're getting at. The total number of bitcoins in circulation is always known. The value of each bitcoin is only at what price it trades, completely determined by market forces.


Right now and for at least the next hundred years, new bitcoins will be created roughly every ten minutes. Exactly 25 every ten minutes right now, for the next 3+ years. Then it halves to 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes for the coming 4 years, then it halves again for the next 4 years and so on. The number of newly created coins shrinks relatively fast this way, and there will be a point in time where new bitcoins are created less frequently than they will be lost or destroyed. That's when theoretically, the deflationary period starts.

How did the unlock work? Does the victim just enter the transaction ID into the program and then a while later, the criminals manually unlock it, or do you think it works fully automatic?

Your argument that "the hard working savers will suffer" seems completely unfounded. Why would they suffer? That a few nerds who jumped in early get rewarded for doing admittedly relatively little (except taking risk) doesn't mean that the rest "suffers" because of that. When they join the party later, it doesn't matter - when they buy btc for $1000, they'll have btc worth $1000.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:54:57
Difficulty automatically readjusts so that none of that makes any difference. If there are more people using more efficient mining technology, it just gets harder to mine. If what you're suggesting were true, people could mine **more** bitcoins by using better technology. And that is incorrect - the number of bitcoins the network puts out always stays relatively the same.


Yes, this is how it works. And no, I'm not saying that people will use so many ASICs that it will use **more** energy than GPUs, I'm saying people will use so many ASICs that it will use the **same** energy as GPUs.
Bitcoin mining always grows until there is an equilibrium between energy cost &lt;--&gt; mining profit. And because of that, it is completely irrelevant how "efficient" the method is. More miners will be deployed and difficulty rises until energy cost ~= mining profit.
If with GPUs, you can produce 1 btc by expending energy worth 1 btc, and then ASICs come along, there will be ASICs added at least as long until difficulty is so that you can produce 1 btc by expending energy worth 1 btc. That is the intended way the bitcoin mining system works.

That makes no sense. You're saying "it makes sense for trading". What the hell is that even supposed to mean? That is not a justification for it having any value. What you're saying is "it makes sense to buy it because there are other suckers who might buy it too". Fine, if that is the way you approximate value, good luck in investing. And the only arbitrage you're "exploiting" is the one that comes from the unjustified valuation of the non-coin in the first place.

@_date: 2013-08-23 21:45:35
Interesting point. I knew about intel's plans for that, but didn't think about the possibility of stealth mining in that context.
Still, I believe even then, the returns are diminishing. Even if someone wouldn't care about privacy and could use the full GPU power of a computer, ASICs are just **so much** for efficient, that it probably won't pay off too well in the long run. Someone running a botnet for profit has to evaluate what's his most profitable option is. And with the rewards for mining constantly going down, he'd probably rather turn back to sending spam, DDoS extortion or whatever else these guys do for profit.

The different side of the story is that the real world is a very complex system, and that simple explanations like this film tries to offer are rarely the real answer. First of all, the FED is not this "uncontrolled private organisation" that does what it wants like it's painted in the film. That's bullshit. If you want to know how it really works: it's complicated. Read the [wikipedia article about the Federal Reserve System](


Well, what of the surface information that is based on facts **confirms** what you watched in the video? You're going at it from the wrong side, which is exactly always the case with conspricary theories. Nobody has to disprove what the conspiracy says, the conspiracy has to prove what **it** says. When you're talking with a conspiracy theorist, he's always going the way "Prove that what I'm saying is not true, prove that it's not true!" The answer is "**No**. Prove that what you're saying is true."
The Rothschild family is the  topic for conspiracy nuts. The hatred towards them is rooted in century old antisemitism, and that is really all there is to say about that. Yes, they are rich (*very* rich), but that doesn't mean they're behind all the evil in the world. It's bullshit.


Which is exaclty why films like this are so dangerous. They're believable enough to be taken as truth without proper fact checking.
Some points about what's wrong with this film are raised in the rationalwiki article I linked, which was the best I could find in a hurry. I know there is a detailed list out there that someone put together explaining all that is wrong in the film, but I can't seem to find it anymore (it's difficult to google since the damn film is called "The American Dream", which only gives a gazillion unrelated results). Wish I had saved it when I read it. You can try to find it yourself if you're so inclined.
You can also read this insightful article about the film:

I believed they were overvalued at 2.5 already. I bought back in because I noticed the reactions of others, the increased spread of awareness and expected (or at least hoped) the mania to continue for a while longer. You're right in that I wasn't being very rational there either, I was just betting on the irrationality and greed of other people.
I can't deny the possibility of having an emotional component in this, nobody can be really objective about themselves. But rest assured that I'm not "spreading FUD" or anything like that to drive the price down. I'm just stating my honest opinion and expectations on how the future will play out. That is something you can only do once you're out. I had the same opinion a few days ago, but I couldn't have been honest about it without acting against my own interest. 
So I guess what I'm trying to say is just that everyone should really evaluate their expectations and try to avoid being blinded by shiny mountains of bitcoin. If you've done that and draw the conclusion that the stock is still worth being invested in, that's fine by me. I wish you the best of luck.

Also, it's not just a fraction of a percent in time difference. If without additional transactions, the block would be 100kb in size, and with them it's 200kb, it takes double the time to send it (ignoring overhead). And since it thus takes double the time on *every hop* through the network, it takes double the time to propagate fully. I believe that could make for a very noticeable difference.

No. That's exactly what percentages do, they compare values **relatively**, so that it **doesn't** matter how much you own.
If I own $100 in bitcoin, it doesn't matter if I own 50 at $2 each or 0.5 at $200 each. And if the price loses 10%, it's exactly the same in both cases: I lose $10. It doesn't magically matter more because I own only 0.5 at $200 each.

The thing is, if this would be abused, it wouldn't be done many times over extended periods of time. It would be more like a huge one-time heist. You changing your pool after that wouldn't help a thing, the damage would already be done.
And it wouldn't need to be a pool that has gone to the "dark side". Just imagine if hackers took over the 2 or 3 largest pools. Once they get access (remotely by abusing bugs, or IRL by bribing the right people, by paying a prostitue to steal the passwords from the admin's drawers... you name it), they could easily orchestrate everything without anyone noticing, then *BAM*, they double spend millions of dollars worth of coins. That's a crime worth planning for years, and if you think it can't be done, you're naive. The only thing that can generally increase security against something like that is spreading out the hashpower to more pools/individual miners. Individual miners "voting against" a pool after such a double spend has already happened is no answer, not even close. When that happens, bitcoin will be dead.

I don't need to give "evidence". It's a conclusion that follows from the continuance of the basic concept of bitcoin. 
I can repeat it for you: In bitcoin, the more energy invested, the higher the security of the network. It needs to be huge, so nobody can invest the same amount of energy than the rest of the network to overturn it.
If you want me to throw some pointless numbers at you, here's a very conservative calculation of where we're at right now... 
- Bitcoin network ~ 90 TH/s
- Most efficient ASIC advertised we have today... lets take the 60 W/GH/s that BFL was advertising (which was of course a load of bullshit)
- = 5400000W
You can take that times 10 and are probably not even close to the real number, because most of the network still runs on inefficient GPUs

"Gained physical access to my phone"
What the fuck do you think "2FA" is when you log in to your services on your fucking 2FA device. Jesus Christ. That's not 2FA, that's just "nothing".
Really, I'm sorry for your loss, but seriously, what do you think **"two-factor-authentication"** is for, when you don't divide up the access. You can **never**, I repeat, **never** log in to any service that uses the 2FA, on the device that holds the 2FA codes, that's the **whole fucking point of it**. The whole point is that it can be either "oh shit, someone gained access to my PC, but no worries, he doesn't have my phone", or "oh shit, someone gained access to my phone, but no worries, he doesn't have my PC". But if you just have it all in one device, you could just disable it completely, it doesn't matter.
I hope that maybe somehow Coinbase insures you for your loss, but I wouldn't bet on it. I hope you can live with that loss and it doesn't hit you too hard - after all, that really is a lot of money.

I never seriously mined. I bought all my initial coins, even though that makes only for about 10% of my coins now. Most come from investing in bitcoin securities (obviously quite successfully), but I pulled out of that field completely due to the market turning to shit overall (and I'm glad I did with the exchanges closing down now... it's a bloodbath). I have all my coins invested at one site currently, but I'm not stating publicly where because by advertising it as a good investment opportunity, I'd just lessen my own profit (some of you know what I mean).
I bought some stuff with bitcoins, some electronics like a [Nexus 7]( and recently some gold and silver from [amagimetals](


Tough to say. I tend to think that investing your coins is generally a good idea - it worked great for me. But you have to do **a lot** of research, you can't just jump on the first thing that sounds good. Knowing when and how to apply proper math is as important as it is to ignore almost everything other people have to say.


Keep in mind that "5-10 years" is longer than the whole lifetime of bitcoin until now, so it's really not a prediction anyone can even make. But like most people, I'd say definitely by then it will either be dead or a lot bigger than today. Hopefully the second.

Yes, thanks. I'm aware of that, but thought it would be easier to explain it this way. Because doing so (hashing over the header, including the merkle root) does effectively what I said, doing a hash over the complete unique contents of the block, since a change to anything in the block will change the header and thus change the resulting hash.

That are over 115000 BFL 65 Gh/s Singles. How many of those have reached people yet? Zero. But sure, after delaying shit for 10 months, they'll suddenly deliver a whopping 100k of those things. 
Also, if bought for the cheapest price we've seen (that's $1300 for 65 Gh/s), that's about $150000000 worth of hardware. And the price is only rising now, evidently.

That is the same point twice. "Convert it to goods and dollars" is reselling it. And you can only "resell" it (at least to a rational buyer) for a value that is equal or lower to what it brings in future profit. So yes, that is to be ignored in the calculation.

I think it started at the beginning of the year, because the block reward halved. Lesser supply meant the price had to rise, at least a bit. That's why I heavily invested in december, when it was still €10/BTC.
I think the biggest factor then was just the feedback loop: Price rises, people see that it rises, buy more in the hope that it keeps rising, which raises it more, then media coverage because it's rising so quickly and so on. But there are also a lot of businesses being founded on a bitcoin basis, more businesses accept it as payment. You could just say it's gaining acceptance and a lot of followers. The people come for the investment opportunity, then learn why exactly bitcoin is so great, and stay for the hope of a better future.

There can't really be an algorithmic way of calculating this, it's based on the behaviour of miners. If all miners suddenly decide to not accept any transactions with a fee below 1 btc, every transaction with a fee below 1 btc would have a 0% chance.

Right now, if you have a few million $, you can have a great influence in the price. If that is what you mean. But It's not actually destabilizing the currency itself. The currency doesn't care about its market price.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:45:24
Nobody can guarantee that, that is correct. Nothing gets "worth more" automatically anyway. But if you have a fixed supply **and** the economy grows, the total value of the economy is divided up into the still fixed amount of units of currency, thus each unit of currency is worth more. 
Having that amount of units be subdivisible into more smaller units just ensures that you can still trade for small amounts of value, **if** the value of a single units gets too high.
@_date: 2013-09-28 00:21:08
Yes, because the price for Bitcoin rised. But that has nothing to do with his investment in the miner. It means his investment in Bitcoin was a success, not his investment in the miner. The investment in the miner was a loss. If he had taken the direct approach of investing in bitcoin (by just buying them), his investment in bitcoin wouldn't have been diluted by the miner component and he would have made more. So again, the investment in the miner was bad. 
Since the investment in a miner is *always* also an investment in bitcoin, it's just not logical to count gains in bitcoin value towards the profitability of the miner. It just has nothing to do with it.

Not sure what videos you are talking about. But if someone promises you free and easy money **anywhere**, he's lying. If someone knew a way to make free and easy money, he'd just do it himself as much as he could, not make youtube videos telling other people about it.
And that would be especially true for bitcoin mining. There is only a fixed amount of bitcoins created (about 25 every 10 minutes), and all miners on the world compete for these. If another miner comes into the game, it only gets harder for the rest, so there is really no reason for them to "reel you in" like that. I think you just saw a video mentioning mining and what it is, and you heard what you wanted to hear.
The simple truth in life is: if you want to get money, you either work for it or you risk the money you already have for a chance of increasing it. Nothing is free.

Multibit uses a method called SPV:
Basically, that means it just validates for a specific time in the past. If you're making a transaction with inputs that have been spent a long time in the past, it wouldn't notice it. There are some more complicated processes that ensure security. But it can never achieve the full safety, and it relies on honest full nodes to get its information. But it's still very safe and you really don't need to worry about that. I'd trust any amount of coin with a multibit wallet that I would trust bitcoin-qt with. But the big amounts of coin should just not be on a computer that has access to the internet at all.

I have made ~ $1000 in the past month doing this (it's called "arbitrage"). It's a good thing for the market, and if you see an opportunity, use it.
The only reason I see why it's not already more heavily done is that to make bigger profits, you need to use bigger investments. You gotta spend money to make money. If you say you see a $10 difference at two markets, that means you get just $10 profit per bitcoin, while you have to spend ~ $120 for each coin. And when you have done it once, you need to "refill" the cheaper exchange with cash to do it again. Since most of this refilling is done by wiring money from a bank account, it takes time. It's basically a business that is only there because moving fiat money takes time.
If you had $100k on every exchange instead, you could do this very easily and very profitable - the disadvantage being that you'd need to trust the exchanges with that money, and history shows that this can really come to bite you in the ass.

No, seriously: You don't know where the price is going, no one does. And if we want bitcoin to be used as a currency, we better start treating it as one. What you can easily do to circumvent the logical fallacy in your head ("but if the price goes up, i'm losing money with this purchase") is just buying the btc for the purchase right when you make it. Want to spend 0.1 btc on the humble bundle? Buy 0.1 btc with $ and give those fresh btc to them.

By your idiotic argumentation, it doesn't matter what material you use to make jewelry, it should all cost the same, because its value comes only from the added value of the production/craftsmanship. That is bullshit. I'm not saying that jewelry doesn't have added value, of course it has. There is value added in the production. But the value it initially receives through its material has nothing to do with that.

When a miner (or pool) solves a block, he gets the block reward (currently 25 bitcoins) + all the fees that are attached to the transactions that he takes into the block. He gets those coins in a single transaction that is called the "coinbase" or "generation" transaction. In case of a pool, the total reward is then distributed between all miners.


Those "blacklisted" coins are called "tainted". You can google that to learn more. I'm not really an expert on taint analysis, but AFAIK, it's not reliable and can be broken through mixers anyway.

What they think is that there isn't enough regulatory certainty to deal with it, and huge risks of fraud/scams/money laundering, which is absolutely right.

The thing is that a bitcoin is not "a string of numbers". Or anything "physically" really. It's just an abstraction. All there is is transactions, and if one says "5 from A to B" and one says "4 from B to C" then you can **derive** from that "OK, so B owns 1 btc". But there is nowhere a direct representation of "a bitcoin". That's why a statement like this is plain false. And like I said, the reality is much more interesting, it's one of the parts that make the bitcoin system ingenious.
Often they say it like this ("a bitcoin is a big number") or they say things like "The blockchain is this big ledger, where it says 'person A has 5 bitcoins, person B has 2 bitcoins'".
Like I said, it may be easier to explain it to noobs like this, but it's false, and I cringe everytime I read it. Another thing about this one in particular is that they say "it's a long string of numbers"... So, then it's a number. Would you say that 1000 is "a short string of numbers"? No. It's just a number.
I'm pedantic, I know...

Again, that is relevant here how? You don't save money when you buy a miner. If you invest $1000 in a miner, you can't buy bread with that money anymore just like you can't if you put it in bitcoin?! I really don't understand what you're even trying to say here. 
The point is that if you have bought a miner, you have invested that money in bitcoin already. The only question to be asked is if you either get 
A. more bitcoins with the miner, or
B. more bitcoins if you buy bitcoins directly

Gold is not a good conductor. The reason for gold use in electronics has nothing to do with conductivity. It's because of gold's high resistance against corrosion. But most of the time, it's just used for marketing reasons (to get a higher price, because "oooh it has shiny gold"). It doesn't have much of an effect that cheaper alternatives couldn't bring. So don't buy gold plated cables and such, it's a waste of money.
Silver is a far better conductor. [In fact, it's the metal with the highest electrical &amp; thermal conductivity that we know]( So if you want to attribute good industrial properties to a precious metal - that's silver, not gold.

Bitstamp doesn't ask for a bank statement either. And I have never used Coinbase (because I'm not from the U.S.), but you don't need to validate your identity in any way there? I don't believe that. I'm pretty sure you need to verify your ID like on every other exchange that follows the law. I would be more concerned if they **didn't** have that. 
This verification stuff is not something the exchanges do for fun. If you've been here for a while, you know that they *had to* introduce this stuff, because AML regulation etc was going to kill them otherwise.


Bitstamp and other exchanges are likewise registered businesses. Again, it's just because you don't trust that you can follow up because it's in a different country. But that is wrong.

If you want to still get into mining, you should go with [kncminer]( I have an order there, but I'm still not sure I would really recommend it. It's a big gamble. IF they really deliver in september like they plan to, it might still be a good deal, but considering past ASIC companies and how they tend to break promises, it's very questionable that's a realistic expectation.

Definitely not amateurs. Oliver Flaskämper, the head of the organization, operates several other rather successful german websites, like geizkragen.de content.de firma.de parfuemerie.de etc etc.
But I really don't like the news that they've been hacked and I hope they're aware of the huge measures they have to take to ensure the security of the exchange. Running a bitcoin exchange is like running a bank, it has to be **absolutely** secure and brute-force resistant. I don't think there's anything more entizing for a black hat right now than to hack a bitcoin exchange, since it equals free anonymous money.
But I think their model is by design way more secure than all the other exchanges where you deposit money directly.

That is true for improving the security of **passwords**. Yes, memory hard functions make them less crackable. If I have a password and I don't want somebody to brute-force it, it makes sense to use a memory-hard algorithm.
But we're not talking about securing passwords here. We're talking about doing completely arbitrary work that just exists to provide a proof of work. We don't need to increase the difficulty of this artificially by using a different algo, we have the difficulty set by the network for that.

@_date: 2013-08-12 20:08:24
lol, no :) 
I don't feel like explaining this in detail now, but just know this: difficulty only adjusts in such a way that a new bitcoin block keeps being found roughly every 10 minutes. Difficulty can also go **down** if blocks are being found too slow. So it never gets "unsolvable", only the effort necessary increases/decreases.

Right? It's unbelievable.
I guess since the U.S. is very powerful, military-wise, it makes sense to see it as a "secure location". But that fact also makes it really insecure. If you want your stuff back and they don't give it, what are you gonna do? Declare war? Ha!
My country (Germany) already has its head so far up America's ass, they could probably tell us we're never getting anything back, and we'd just answer "humm ok... can we get you anything else?".

We're not "seeing a steady devaluing of the currency" and it has nothing to do with mining (if anything, more costly mining would *increase* the price... )
Bitcoin was highly overvalued due to the bubble. Go to google and check out graphs of other bubbles, bitcoin related or not, doesn't matter. Just recognize how it usually unfolds. After the bubble, you usually have a long, slow decline, when the market tries to find the new ground. And we're simply still in that decline. It's hard to guess where the new floor will be, but I could imagine it settling somewhere around $40-50. If you think "Oh god no, that's nothing!" - it's still a lot, it's more than a 300% increase since the start of the year, when the bubble started, and that is **a lot** of growth.
That said... it's not that everything **has** to play out the same way every time, don't predict future based on past blablabla, and I could be completely wrong with this, but it's pretty hard to ignore this pattern when it stares you in the face every time you see a bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:52:07
That is wrong. Everyone with this type of thinking is completely missing the bigger picture. Even if bitcoin wasn't accepted by a single merchant, it would still hold a lot of value, much higher than what it sells for currently.
People are way too focused on the "currency" aspect anyway. Bitcoin is what it is. You *can* use it as a simple currency, but it is so much more than that. Give it a few years and you'll see it unfold.
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:53:09
The reason they sell them is because they saw the point coming where they would have them lying around for months, without being able to deploy them themselves (due to infrastructure problem). Basically, they produce more than they can use. So, since they can sell them at very good pricing right now, it makes sense to do so, even if they create a little competition for themselves by doing it.
Your other point I don't understand.. 


Why must it be based on short time frames? Buying any other ASIC right now, it's very questionable that you'll see it within this year. Having something you can buy **now** is worth a lot.

That's a very general question and hardly explained well in just a little comment on reddit. To start to use it, you don't even need to know *how* it works, just *that* it works. But it's fascinating and ingenious how it works, so I'd recommend to learn about it. If you're really interested, read about it or watch some introductory videos like [this]( or [that]( (the second one goes well into detail). Here's also [a good extensive course on the topic](


You can make an online wallet like on blockchain.info. That's pretty easy to use. How to get the bitcoins to use? You exchange them for your fiat currency on one of the exchanges, or offer goods or services for them. Just like you get any other currency.


Odd question. How do you have a partial dollar? You just have it. I think you may be confused because you assume something like *1 Bitcoin is like a code, or a file on a computer*. That's not how it works, but you'll know that when you understand the basics of bitcoin and the blockchain by learning about them.

10 minutes / block is just the target that the system tries to maintain. It tries to set the difficulty in such a way that if *current* hashpower continued, it would take 10 minutes *on average* for the network to find a block.
But difficulty adjustment only takes place every 2016 blocks, and if hashpower is added in the meantime, the average time is lower. This year, enormous amounts of hashpower have been added due to ASICs being introduced to the market (and this increase will continue for quite a while, until ASICs stop being so insanely profitable), and during the second half of a difficulty cycle, we are usually closer to 5 minutes per block than to 10.
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:28:37


I already said it in my first post, but you seem to not read them well, so I'll gladly say it again: that is false. Where did you get that? IP addresses for each bitcoin transaction are **NOT** logged.


Neither I nor Bitcoin gives a shit what your silly american government "mandates". Bitcoin doesn't belong to the U.S. If they try to outlaw it that way, they'll only spit in their own soup. Bitcoin will fork, with an U.S. approved version that everybody would immediately stop using, and the remaining true bitcoin that would work just as before.

A system doesn't need to be perfect to go mainstream, it just needs to be *good enough*. After that, people will not automatically favor something else, even if it is better, only if it is *so much better* that it's a new milestone. 
That's because it takes a lot of energy to build an infrastructure around one thing that has proven to be working. If then suddenly someone comes and notices "eeeeh well, that feature there could have been done a little bit better", it would take too much effort to throw everything achieved before overboard. Look at telephones.. the internet has been around for quite some time now, and some people still use landlines to communicate with each other. Why? They're basically absolutely pointless and obsolete now. But even for something as groundbreaking as the internet, it takes a lot of time to surpass another system that has been established.
Another good example for this is TCP/IP, the protocol on which most of the internet is built today. It's not perfect, it actually has pretty severe weaknesses, especially concerning security (when it was developed decades ago, people simply weren't expecting the internet to become such a hostile environment, with people injecting packets, spoofing IPs, MITM attacks and so on). But it was good enough to work, and security measures could be built in layers on top of it. The same goes for bitcoin. Additional features can be built on it, as the need for them arises.
Another point to consider is that bitcoin is not solid. It's being actively developed and it can change with time. While groundbreaking changes to the protocol itself are unlikey, unless absolutely necessary, there's still enough wiggle room for it to adapt.
It's still possible, of course, that a completely different revolutionary concept arises that makes bitcoin obsolete. But nothing like that is to be seen on the horizon wherever you look. And if bitcoin keeps growing, when the time comes for it to die, maybe people are already all using bitcoin, and the shift to the new currency(?) will work from bitcoin to it just like shifting from fiat to bitcoin today.

That is something I observe every day on reddit... I'm not saying that to sound like a dick or something, I'm honestly surprised a lot of times when I read comments by people who can write clever, witty, well formulated, and then it becomes apparent that they are not capable of doing very basic critical thinking and following logic. 
Proves to me that logic and speech are really kind of seperated concepts in the brain. And that people who sound smart not necessarily *are*.
Anyway, regarding this author, or anyone writing about Bitcoin, you have to keep in mind that they write this stuff to get clicks. It can be complete bullshit, as long as it fuels a lot of emotions and gets a lot of attention. His first article did that perfectly - all the raging Bitcoiners read the thing and came to tell him how wrong he was.

Bitcoin's fluctuations are not worrisome. Maybe to you they are. Then don't buy any.


How about you just buy BTC, then when you want to spend them, you spend them, and buy new BTC? That's the way every smart person handles this. If bitcoin increases in value, you get what you buy cheaper than what you paid for the btc.


There's nothing wrong with people using it as an investment. They can use it to blow their noses in it, who cares? Who are you to decide how people have to use Bitcoin? That is the process we're going through and will keep going through for quite a while - finding out how Bitcoin will actually be used.

That way, he can't just pull a weapon on you and force you to give him the coins.. also if he tries to screw you in a more civil way, you have video evidence with which you can go to the police.
If something seems really "off" to you when you're doing the trade, trust your gut and don't do it. You can always sell the coins later.
Everything will probably be alright, but always keep in mind that there are shady people out there who have no problem taking money from a noob.

Quite the contrary: It promotes keeping value in bitcoin instead of returning it to fiat fast. You can have it circulate all you want, if you got 10 btc from the start, and then a year later you sell 10 btc, you pay no tax.

Bitcoin is an investment, period. It is a **risky** investment, yes. But that doesn't fucking mean that investing in bitcoin is "gambling". Gambling means playing against the odds and hoping to get lucky. That is **not** what bitcoin is about, and if you don't see that, then you better take all your money out, because then you have no fucking clue what you're even supporting.

AM really is a good company, I'm a shareholder myself. but I got my shares at 0.7, which is reasonable. ~2.5 is retarded. all those people making the advertising here are not in it for long, they are just looking to pump and dump. be careful, and apply common sense.

Being able to write properly is not "social etiquette", it's a sign of proper education, and a clear and organized mind. People who read a lot (as in not just read gibberish on facebook) and think a lot, automatically write well.
Creating a website that is supposed to make a profit, and then not being able to have it speak to the users in proper english, IS a sign of someone managing his business badly. I agree that this particular mistake here wasn't really dramatic, but your generalization that spelling *doesn't mean anything* is complete bullshit.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:39:58


This is *only* to be considered an advantage, if you think the mining companies are going to cooperate and try 51% attacks, which is highly, highly unlikely. Otherwise it's just being sad that you can't keep digging for gold with a shovel, while people with more determination put huge efforts into creating modern technology to do it.
Also, ASICs contrary to CPU/GPU usage have the great advantage of not being vulnerable to botnet-abuse.
For the faster confirmations, I have heard often enough that it's just smoke and mirrors and that the faster confirmations in litecoin are less secure, so you'd need more confirmations to be able to trust a transaction, which would render the whole "faster" concept pointless. But I'm not an expert on that topic, just relying on admittedly very "pro-bitcoin" sources.

Ok.. first of all, there is no such thing as "intrinsic value". What is that supposed to be, the "soul" of a thing or what? People who talk about "intrinsic" value only mean value, just that they somehow think there's magic involved.
And even if there was intrinsic value, bitcoin would have it and fiat wouldn't.
And all of that completely aside, no, that is not the definition of fiat currency. Fiat is money that we are ordered to use, where someone like the goverment orderes us "you MUST accept this as currency". That is not the case with bitcoin.

So if I receive redlisted coins from whatever source (I can't even deny getting them), I have to actually prove my innocence to someone? I am literally **guilty until proven innocent**?
And who would be the "operator" in that scenario? Law enforcement? Of what nation? The idea alone of having such a central point of power is *insane*. You of all people should know how much stuff like this goes against what Bitcoin stands for.
Yes, criminals are scary. And money that flows frictionless allows them to do some additional scary stuff. But in no way is that a problem that Bitcoin has to solve in a technological way.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:40:54
Yes, that is possible. I'd suggest investing in ASICMINER, it's the one that looks most promising to me. They are currently already operating with their first ASICs over 6TH/s (they're ID 67117 at [btcguild]( and are aiming to have over 60TH/s ~~at the end of the month (IIRC)~~ by middle of the month. That is more than all of the bitcoin network has together at the moment.

your two choices for buying shares atm are:

Note please that those are not *real* shares, it's a passthrough, so someone who has real shares redirects them to you. 
Real shares can only be bought by auction in the forums atm, but as far as I understand, the passtrough works just the same way, only that you will probably pay a little more. But if you're looking to earn some BTC by dividents, that's a good way.

Last try. 
Say I can buy a machine that prints dollars, but I can only pay it in pesos. I can buy it for the equivalent of $1000 in pesos. Then later, when I have the machine, I turns out that it only prints a maximum of $500. Would my purchase have been a good investment? Does it matter if I exchange the dollar back to pesos right when it prints them?
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:43:13
You're aware that you are basically asking how you can print your own money? If it were that easy, everybody would just do it. Starting mining is always a gamble, you need to estimate the future development of difficulty to estimate if you'll ever get even with the costs of your miner. If someone could give you a definite answer what you need to do, they wouldn't give you the answer but instead just do it themselves, take huge loans with their banks or whatever and start making a giant mining company.
Generally, if you're a newbie to bitcoin, mining is not for you. That's stuff for the advanced course. 


I'd go so far as calling them that, yes. They have started shipping out units, very slowly, **a year** after their claimed shipping date, and during that year, have consistently ~~said~~ lied that they will be starting shipment in "two weeks" (due to this, that phrase is already a joke in the bitcoin scene). Don't order from them.
I got my money on [KnCminer]( but that's a gamble too. They say they'll start shipping in September, but for all I know, the whole thing could end up never happening at all.
To find out what budget you need to make X bitcoins a month, you can take the hashrate of a miner and put it in a [calculator]( But you always need to estimate when you will have your miner and what the difficulty will be then (which is increasing very fast right now).
@_date: 2013-11-03 02:27:06
Well, the way it's meant to be used is that you don't do that and just send btc to where you want to send them and the wallet will take them from wherever it can.
If you just want to gather all the coins in one address again, you can just make one transaction with your whole balance to a new address that you control. Since you're spending everything, there is no change.
Anyway, this is not the way it's meant to be used and if you're like me and you don't like how this works and want to have direct control over your addresses, just use another client instead of bitcoin-qt. Nobody should use bitcoin-qt anyway.
@_date: 2013-06-04 14:21:00


Problem is, it wouldn't, it shouldn't, and it won't. And to add to your point, it was designed to prevent GPUs from dominating the market. Now, if you want to mine litecoin, you do it on a GPU. The whole thing is just bullshit. It's not being actively developed in any direction by anyone, it's just this thing that somehow weirdly survives on false promises. Forget about it and keep your trust in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:29:52
Aha... your previous comment was that you don't want to *spend* bitcoin because you're afraid that it could be worth more tomorrow. Now you're saying you wouldn't want to *buy* bitcoin because you're afraid it could be worth less tomorrow? So to sum up: you're afraid? Like I said, then don't buy.
The guy who sold his porsche has now more value in bitcoin than he ever could have. Even if he sold his porsche at the absolute worst time of the april bubble, he has more now than he had then.
If you're buying bitcoin, you do it because you see and understand the fundamentals and believe that generally, it will go up over time. I've been in bitcoin for some time now, and I couldn't care less about the volatility. I understand what I'm dealing with here and I believe that the general direction of bitcoin's value is **up**, as it always has been.

There is no difference in risk here for seller and buyer.
For the buyer, there's the risk that the seller is just an asshole who doesn't send any product. Then his coins are gone, but the seller can't get them either. On the other side, when the seller sends the product, he has the risk that the buyer is just an asshole who doesn't confirm the trade by sending him the key. But the buyer can't get his coins back. On either side, the risk is the same.
The important thing is that neither side can actually **profit** from being an asshole here. Doing a trade this way sure isn't perfect, but as the site states it, it's

If a decentralized exchange is what you want, that is a very hard thing to accomplish. If you know a way, go ahead.
An exchange acts as a mediator for 2 people exchanging bitcoin for money. The exchange has by definition a centralized role here. If you take the centralized exchange out, how will this work? I want to sell my bitcoin to you, but how would I know that I can trust you to actually give me the money - or how can you trust me that you will actually get your bitcoin?
[Ripple]( is trying to solve this, but it's still very early and I'm not so sure it will work out all too well. 
Basically, it will work around the idea of chains of trust. So I want to sell you bitcoins, but don't trust you. But I trust Bob, and Bob trusts Alice, and Alice trusts you. There's a chain of trust that the system can work on. 
But I'm definitely not an expert on this and shouldn't try to be too specific.
I completely agree with you though that the current exchange situation is horrible. But you can bet your ass on the fact that there are already professional people trying to solve this and become **easy, secure and reliable** - there is a **lot** of money to be made as a successful exchange.

2 exchanges have already closed because of possible legal problems. These "shares" and "stocks" are not real and the practice of trading with this stuff is probably illegal in the U.S. That's the one thing.
The other is that bitcoin stocks in general only work well for stuff that is also denominated in bitcoin. And that practically only works for bitcoin mining operations. So for AM it worked well: you pay the shares in btc, they earn btc by mining and sales, and pay the dividends in btc. But mining is no longer as profitable, the margins are closing down fast. There's big competition from companies that are privately funded and don't need your money.
If you have operations instead that are mainly denominated in dollar or other fiat, a rise in btc value actually means that your stock value goes down. There is for example this one stock stock ("RentalStarter" or something) where they bought cheap houses in the U.S. midwest, fixed them up and rented them out. The shareholders would get dividends according to the rent, converted to btc. It's not a bad project, and I think it's still going and working. But now think about how it makes sense to do this in bitcoin. You buy shares for 0.1 btc, which at the time is $10. Everything works great, you get dividends etc. Now bitcoin prise rises 10x. That means that your share value will go down, and suddenly, your share is only worth 0.01 btc, which still is $10, but you have actually lost money compared to if you had just kept the btc. It just doesn't make logical sense to buy into these stocks and at the same time hope for an increase in bitcoin price.
And the last point is that you have to be very, very careful with that stuff. The bitcoin stock markets are completely unregulated and practically everyone can just come along and say "hey, we want to gather 5000 btc for this and that awesome project, we'll pay you back 1000% within the next 3 weeks" and people will fall for it, out of sheer greed. It happened so often it's not even funny anymore. There are really a lot of scams, and if you don't know what you have to look for, you can end up losing all. Not to say you can't profit of those scams... I made about 70 btc from the "Labcoin" scam this summer/fall before I realized they were a scam. Luckily I was smart enough to jump boat early when it became obvious why they were acting so shady - others were not so lucky.
It's a big topic and it is kind of exciting. But again, I would not recommend getting into this stuff now. It's too dangerous, and btc are too valuable to just throw them into experiments like that.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:42:37
They'd be dumb to ship early. The profits in running a 60GH/s miner are still HUGE, if they just run them themselves, they make more in less than a WEEK than their customer pay them for the machines.
And you as a customer have zero influence. When you preorder, you accept to get it when they want to give it to you. They can delay shipment as much as they please, and so they will. "We're still working on perfecting the chip, testing is taking longer than expected, blablabla..". We're seeing that already, all bullshit excuses.
When I was talking with my father about my thoughts about pre-ordering a BFL Miner, his answer stuck with me: "Why would **anybody ** give away a money printing machine, as long as it still works?"
Just think about that for a minute, before greed overcomes you and you throw your money away.
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:42:17
Necessary for this to work is that there is an active exchange in the target country. With Turkey, that's not a problem, apparently.
What you also need for it to work is people wanting to send money in both directions. Say there was just people sending bitcoins from the U.S. to Kenia, but not from Kenia to the U.S., nobody there would buy the bitcoins and they'd be stuck. But I guess this won't be a problem most of the time, since there is a lot of incentive both ways - people sending money home to their families, and people wanting to escape the country with their money.

Not a lawyer either, but I'm pretty sure they can do that. Of course they couldn't give you a "used product" in the end, after mining with it themselves. But I don't think there is any legal obligation stopping them from holding the product back as long as they want. As far as I know, nowhere did they ever guarantee anything. And if they don't make a legally binding promise like that, there's nothing the law can do.
It was my father who strongly advised me against pre-ordering from BFL. He has been working in the hardware-business for over 30 years (in fact he and his company were creating the very first GPUs back in the day), and he said he has seen this a million times. The excuses are always the same: "testing didn't go according to plan - oh there are just these little power supply problems that we want to get rid off - now we have this and that generic problem". I'm glad I listened to him, because what I could witness in the following months was exactly as predicted. The sad fact is just that as a customer who bought an unfinished product, there is **nothing at all** you can do.
And if not legal consequences, what should they fear? Lose reputation for their company? They shouldn't do this because customers wouldn't buy from them in the future? I've heard that as a reason before, but nobody can seriously mean that by now. Their reputation is so destroyed, they'd be way better off just creating a new fake "fresh startup" the next time and place strawmen on the papers so nobody knows it's still the same incompetent asses.

**No.** Wherever that sits in your brain, erase it. That is complete bullshit that someone came up with at some point, and for some reason it kinda stuck with people, maybe because it sounds nice or whatever. Noobs or less technical people have that misunderstanding all the time. I don't get it, because it's more complicated than the truth.
The simple truth is, the miners need to find a number so that the hash of the block is **lower than a target X**. So yes, 000123 has more "leading zeros" than 001234, but that is just because it's lower. Easy as that. It wouldn't hold true if you're comparing 001234 and 001233. In that case, saying it depends on "leading zeros" is just plain wrong.

You shouldn't jump in with 10k in my opinion, but yes, you should invest. Dip your toes in with smaller amounts, and then let it develop naturally. Let your holdings grow as your confidence grows. Chances are you will be addicted to the bitcoin world soon and soak up knowledge like a sponge.
Many people will tell you that it's very risky and you should just invest what you can afford to lose (seriously, if I had a bitcent for every time I read that phrase..). They have a point. But in my opinion, bitcoin's risk/reward comparison looks very, very good. If you invest $1k, you might, in the worst of all cases, end up losing $1k. If bitcoin becomes a big mainstream success though, you're maybe looking at $100k in 10 years or so. The potential profit outweights the potential loss by a lot.
The most important thing if you get some holding in bitcoin is to learn not to panic-sell. The price swings come and go, but so far, the general direction of the price was upward. Patience pays off.

I'm well aware of that stuff, please spare me the lessons about value. I was pointing out that his only argument was how you can profit off of it, even though that was not the point of discussion. When I am discussing why it has no additional advantage over bitcoin, some kid comes along and says "hey but you can make money off of it, basically by profiting off other suckers who'll hold the bag". That's when you know you have something that isn't actually worth anything, when the proponents don't even try to give rational reasons why the technology is supposed to be good, but instead tell you that it's good that "you can do arbitrage" with a pointless good. Ridiculous.
I know what a Litecoin is worth - it is worth what the market says it is worth. But that doesn't mean the market has to be right. Quite the contrary, the market is wrong pretty much *all the time*.

Oh, OK. Yeah I guess in that case you could double spend it, although not from the same client probably (bitcoin-qt for example would show me a balance of 0 after the first attempted transaction and not let me spend the btc again). 
Your other point - that might work, but only if miners explicitely include that logic.

For basic information, I like this video: 
But you should know that the whole bitcoin thing is a relatively complicated subject, and you should really invest some time to get to know the concept and really understand how it works, what the blockchain is, how "proof of work" comes into play, what miners actually do and so on. It takes from days to weeks to months depending on how smart you are, but I guarantee, the more you get to know, the more you're going to like the idea and how ingenious the system is.
For starters, I'd say make an account at  (an online wallet that has proven trustworthy so far) and just look around a bit.
For actually getting bitcoin so you can actually do something with your new wallet, the first question that comes to mind is: What country are you living in? For U.S. [coinbase.com]( seems to be a good solution, but you're going to wait a few days till you get your coins. There's also [bitinstant.com]( But those are really just for "getting in". If you want to actively trade bitcoins, you should get verified on an exchange asap. Register at [Mt.Gox]( [bitstamp]( and go through the verification (they need to do this stuff due to anti-money-laundering regulation)

Don't think of the bitcoins being on your computer, or usb, or whatever. That's not the case, the coins are always "in the network". All you save and backup are the keys to access them in the network. A "wallet" is nothing else but a bunch of private keys to a bunch of Bitcoin addresses.
So when you have 5 btc on 1 address and you have the private key of that address backed up (in your wallet.dat), it doesn't matter where you spend them, the key still accesses the same address.

Second point is the worst. You know it when you've sold something over Paypal, literally **had the fucking money**, deliver the product, just to then hear "Oh, that payment was made by a hacked account, we're giving the money back to the owner" and have them take it away from you.
I still get so angry when I remember how that happened to me. Those assholes took 700 bucks from me, just because some noob couldn't keep his account secure. Out of product and no payment.
That's one of the things I like most about bitcoin: No chargebacks. If you get hacked, it's your fault, you can't let an innocent 3rd party take the blow for you.

I've been waiting for an implementation of this. Although I'm not a big fan of java, I think I'm going to dig into this over the weekend just because the micro-payment channel thing is so goddamn interesting.
One of the first applications I would see with this is again in the adult business... there are thousands of live-cam sites on the web, where you pay with tokens, credits or something like that for the time that you watch. If you could just easily set up a bitcoin micropayment channel that does everything for you ("pay 0.01 btc/10 min" or similar), that would just be HUGE.

Strictly speaking, you will just have an account at their partner bank (just a regular bank account), but you will be able to connect it to bitcoin.de in such a way that they are able to instantly transfer money between these inner-bank accounts. So you wouldn't be "sending money to bitcoin.de", you would simply deposit money to your bank account, and bitcoin.de would be able to withdraw and deposit money from/to your account instantly.
It's really a great idea and I'm confident it will work very well. It's a win-win. The bank gets a lot of new customers/accounts, and the customers get easy trading + the security of a professional bank.

That's pretty basic bitcoin knowledge.
Bitcoin started with 50 BTC created every ~10 minutes (to be precise: per found block). That amount exactly halves every ~4 years (to be precise: every 210,000 blocks). 
That means that during the first 4 years, half of the 21 million that will ever exist have already been created. Of the remaining 10.5 million coins, half will be created during 4-year-cycle we're currently in, then again half of the remaining coins during the next cycle, and so on.
Right now, we're in the 2nd cycle, and 25 new BTC are created every block. Like the poster before you pointed out, that is still a lot of inflation. People often forget that. Bitcoin being a "deflationary" currency won't start for quite some time - only when there's actually more Bitcoins lost than newly minted. The dramatic price increases we see are only due to dramatic increases in adoption. If no new fiat was flowing into Bitcoin, the price would decrease quite a bit due to the inflation.

I don't remember exactly. But well, you can basically send a transaction to "thiswebsiteDoTcom8KfimAs...." or similar and somebody can see that transaction clearly in the chain. Of course you can't access this address and get the btc back. So you're at least paying a fee if you're doing this.

But that **is** the case, if you're looking at it rationally. Litecoin proponents often like to argue that it can be the "silver to bitcoin's gold", which sounds good, but is complete bullshit. With Silver&lt;-&gt;Gold, there is a big difference in the use cases, value density etc. Gold is better to store high amounts of value, but you can hardly go and do your grocery shopping in gold (paying with tiny amounts of gold dust). That's where silver is better, just because it is worth less for a bigger mass of physical material. 
But for cryptocurrencies, that argument makes absolutely **zero** sense. You just don't need two. You need *one* that gets the job done and has the highest amount of security &amp; people and businesses supporting it.

He has some good points, at least he actually knows a little bit what he is talking about. His error is in point 9 though. Using bitpay is no "additional layer of hassle" worth mentioning. Even if you absolutely hate bitcoin and think it's stupid and its users idiots, there is still exactly zero reason not to just use bitpay and let these idiots pay with bitcoin. And while he's right that that isn't really "using it as a currency", first of all, neither is not using it at all, second, that's supposed to be a temporary step.

I'm not saying that website is a scam itself.
The problem is that Paypal payments are reversible. If someone claims his account was hacked for example, Paypal will, without asking, reverse the payment. And that is what a lot of scammers do: a chargeback scam. Buy virtual goods, pay with paypal, then reverse the payment. Most of the time it's hacked paypal accounts. And because this can be done so easily (and IS done a lot), no one in their right mind would sell bitcoins via paypal. If this website still does it, the only reason can be that they have not yet been scammed enough.
It's one of the reasons why bitcoins are so great: when you have sold something and you got your bitcoin as payment, nobody can just take it away from you again like paypal does it.

The price of bitcoin has **nothing** to do with this. If you want to speculate on the bitcoin price, you can buy bitcoins directly. If you go by profit alone, and you have, say, $1000, you can either A) buy bitcoins for $1000 or B) buy a miner and hope that it will get you *more* bitcoins than you can buy for $1000 today. If the miner doesn't fulfill that, it was a bad investment.
Your other two points are valid, but nobody denies that. But serious miners usually mine to make a profit, not to collect "collectables". And you "serve the bitcoin network" in that case too, even more actually.
I can understand getting **one** of these, because they're cute. I can also understand getting these as a **gift** for people new to bitcoin. But I have no understanding for the people that run 10 or 100 of them on USB hubs... it doesn't make any sense.

PPCoin relies on initial mining (proof-of-work), to ensure that the coins are spread out far enough that it's reliably safe to think that no one can hold more than 50% of the coins. 
In your suggestion, the company giving out the "coins" would hold 100% and give away how many they want.
While with proof-of-work, an attacker needs to have &gt;50% of the hashing power of the network, with proof-of-stake, an attacker needs to have &gt;50% of the coins. This power would quite literally **always** be accessible to the company. At the very least in the beginning, they would hold the most of their own shares, and could just manipulate away however they want. A voting system in this could never be trusted.
There are maybe ways to combat this problem, but I can't think of any from the top of my head. If there is a way to achieve reliable security here, this could become **huge**. But I'm not convinced that it's so easy.
I think what you're overlooking here is that you want a decentralized system for a very centralized job. Cryptocoins are a great thing, but what really makes them great is their decentralized nature. If you have a company that holds 100% of the coins and gives them out to people, you don't have a decentralized currency anymore, you have Linden Dollars, or Facebook Dollars or Amazon Coins or whatever they're called.

If your B is implying that they only sell for a price that would never see ROI, then ASICMINER is the **ONLY** company that does this and for which it makes sense.

While that is true, a block gets larger in size with more transactions. 
That means that you need a bit more time (bandwith) to release it to the network. During that additional time, someone could solve the block before you, orphaning yours. 
That is a disincentive, but it's pretty small.

Ok, if that's true, fine. I got confused because on the [wikipedia page you linked]( it clearly says:

No, you didn't. You're deluding yourself into thinking that, but you didn't. How much btc did the miner cost, how much btc did you make with it? There you go.

Hm, a lot. Not necessarily for goods, more between investment opportunities and exchanges, but I'm still moving money around, freely. I definitely don't just have my coins sitting around, although I suppose many are doing that.
Also, I have a few friends who are into bitcoin (not enough though!). When there is some debt to settle, we already often just go "yeah send it to me in btc later" - and that works great.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:24:32
My gut says it's legit. But it's just 0.01% per day, so 3.7% per year. Not really something I would risk my btc for.

How is that supposed to work? Miners get stock for mining? From what company? How many?
So if I own a company and want to distribute shares, I give miners a percentage of my shares? And they accumulate more and more of my company by mining...?

There is a timestamp encoded in each block, marking when it was found.
Difficulty adjustment can then use the time between the current block and the one 2016 blocks before.

No, that is exactly wrong. The electricity cost is negligible currently. The cost for an ASIC is the problem. After the machine paid for itself, you make nice profit, the electricity doesn't cut much  into it. But the question is IF the machine will pay for itself, and the choices there are really slim. The only miners that are likely to ever make a profit are the ones you get on pre-order, and that involves a lot of risk. History has shown that people get fucked over a lot by doing that. I think the only ASICs that were profitable for the end-user so far were Avalon batch 1.
I completely stayed out and will continue to stay out of this ASIC mining pre-oder bullshit-frenzy. I'll use my money instead to buy more bitcoins, so far that has ALWAYS been the better choice.
If you want to try out mining and have a decent ATI card, just mine litecoins or whatever the flavor-of-the month-coin is right now. I despise these altcoins, but if you're just looking for a bit of profit with your graphics card, they're the way to go, as long as there are suckers who'll buy them from you for btc.
@_date: 2013-07-25 12:47:44
Well, it's only a misconception that it doesn't affect you as a consumer. It's just that you don't *immediately feel* it. But if the merchant has to jump through hoops (essentially meaning he has to *pay more*), who do you think will pay for that in the end? From whom does the merchant get his money?

As it is currently stands, the blockchain can at max grow by 1 MB / 10 minutes. 1 MB is the hard limit on the block size. [But we're still far from reaching that right now.](
Some think that the hard limit will be raised in the future, some think that's a bad idea. We'll see how it plays out, but right now, the maximum it *could* grow is 1 MB / 10 minutes = 6 MB / hour = 144 MB / day = 52.560 GB / year.

All these comments here really show how little people actually understand bitcoin mining...


That doesn't matter. It's a machine that makes bitcoins. When you buy one, you buy nothing else but "future" bitcoins. If you buy one for $1000, and at that point $1000 are 1000 bitcoins, then you need to make these 1000 bitcoins back with the machine, or your purchase was a bad investment and you would have been better off buying bitcoins directly with the money. That is the **only** logic way of thinking here.
@_date: 2013-07-20 10:51:41
Because it's far from safe that they'll hold their dominant position forever. I'd even say it's ridiculously naive to even assume that and base your profit calculations on it. All these "oooh it's 25% APR best investment evarrr" posters forget that AM is at the absolute peak of profitability now, there is no way UP, only DOWN. They're not even holding it anymore now, they have lost a good bit of network share in the past weeks, IIRC they once were at 25%, [now that's 15%]( There are tons of hash rolled out by other companies in the coming months, I simply don't believe they can cover that. 
And once it becomes clear that profit is declining, share price will plummet. What do you win if you get decent dividends every week and then suddenly the price of the shares drops by 1 BTC? You just lost about 50 weeks of profit, even assuming a nice 0.02 btc/share/week. So no, it's not a safe investment, it is a very, very risky one. I'm not saying that you can't go and do it anyway, but this is not my definition of *safe*. It is currently more a gamble on share price than it is on solid return.

Buying BTC immediately like this is hard if you don't want to move and pay someone cash. But keep in mind, that is only hard because fiat money moves so slowly. It's exactly one of the reasons why bitcoin is good. It's ridiculous that it takes multiple days for a bank wire to arrive at its destination.
The problem with other "immediate" payment forms like paypal or credit card is that they are reversible. If I sell you my bitcoins and let you pay with PP or CC, you can just tell them the next day that someone hacked your account. There is no way like this for me to get my btc back. There are a lot of scammers who actually do this, so no one in their right mind would just sell you btc for PP or CC without having some assurance that you're not trying to scam them.
Here is a not-so-well-known service that I have only heard good things about: 
They actually let you buy btc with credit card. But you also have to go through some verification. I have never tried them and I don't know how long that takes, but since their name is btcquick, that might be something you want to check out.

It doesn't matter if you have NVidia, it will still run *way* faster on your GPU. The error you're getting is (I think) because it detects 2 OpenCL platforms, you need to choose one.
So to run it on your GPU, run oclvanitygen with "-p 1".

It's not hindsight advice. When you buy the miner, you are already betting on future value of bitcoins, since the miner doesn't produce cash, it produces bitcoins. 
The miner needs to make more bitcoins than it cost in bitcoins, period. You're just confusing yourself with every other kind of calculation. It's not hindsight or anything like that. Knowing now that the bitcoin price has gone up has nothing to with it. If I were to consider buying a miner now, I would look at how much bitcoins it costs me (A), and try to estimate how much bitcoins it gets me (B). If B is lower than A, I just buy A. 
Again: that the price of bitcoin has gone up, has nothing to do with that at all. It's not hindsight, it's just logic.
@_date: 2013-05-20 12:09:05
No, it doesn't need to be open. It helps if you don't think of it as "the bitcoins travel from there to here, and now they are on my pc". Because that's not the case. The bitcoins are always "stored" in the network. You only have a key to prove that they are yours, and thus you can do it from everywhere in the world, as long as you have the key.
So when someone sends bitcoins from address A to address B, the network just knows that they are on address B now. And anybody who comes along with the correct private key to address B can access the coins.
Your bitcoin client holds a "wallet", which is nothing else but a bunch of those private keys, that access a bunch of addresses.
