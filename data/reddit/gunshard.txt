Bitcoin an open source is peer-to-peer cryptographic payment system/digital currency **protocol** for fixing, storing, and transferring value. A protocol is just a set of rules. 
Bitcoin is a protocol just like TCP/IP (the main Internet communications protocol) or SMTP (a protocol for sending email).
Therefore there is no Bitcoin "CEO" or "President".
If you want to know more about how Bitcoin works, I recommend the Bitcoin series on Khan Academy.

Seriously, the User Experience of this site is horrid, if they truly want to make sales they need to reorder and rename their navigation and simplify their landing page. They also might want to consider not selling everything under the sun.
