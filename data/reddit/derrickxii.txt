This is the biggest misconception in America today. The greatest asset you can every own is a great mind with high consciousness. Gates would befriend the cops as you should. The smart people in the ghetto always find a way to leave. They become smart drug dealers or athletes or gets lucky and gets into college. Everyone else stays poor because they are poor in the mind. It's just easier to put the blame on something outside of yourself. Bill Gates helped me pay for college and never asked for a dime. Some men can't get dragged back to a mean. That's what makes this country great.

"I don't know how to deal with the future if something bad happens..." Who the fuck does?! If you let fear guide you, even when good shit happens, you're worried about the next outcome. Getting out of your head is a hard thing to do , but I have seen a lot of great men put everything they have into Bitcoin. Are they scared of China? No, they know the mining in Eastern Washington is ran by a good man and the good Jews at Spondoolies got our back. American will power is the strongest energy in the world. Silicon Valley is the new intellectual capital of the world. Guys like Balaji, Musk, Zsabo don't fail in the long term. If Bitcoin went to zero tomorrow, I have full faith they could rebuild it from scratch. China also has the most incentive to make this work. Underground banks are getting shutdown and they are tired of communist ideals. The Lee brothers are a good example. 
Bitcoin just needs a Beyoncé or Messi to get its name into the 'crowd'. Everything will change immediately. I assume Bitcoin will become a major topic going into elections. Rand Paul has no clout. Trump and cronies could triple our market cap alone. Okay enough babbling... Just get it time.

I was worried to but there are traits the banks can't replicate. They will never be trusted for their limited supply if used. They will never have the network effect from the last five years.

Keep your stocks if you don't need to sell for next few years. If the market crashes it will comeback it always has. Don't be spooked and let fear guide you that's lame. I don't see how all others think Bitcoin will take over but all majors stock prices will tank ... Get real. We have been conditioned to think small.

On the contrary sir, I am very much in tune with what is going on in the space. To each is own as to the 'whole point of bitcoin' and to me it is as a store of value. I get what you mean about not leaving it on exchanges, but I am 99% confident Coinbase won't take our money and run.

This is an asset you've never seen , in a time you never seen, in a market that hasn't been opened, using IoT hasn't been configured, by people than keep creating new value markets (social,VR,commerce).  Buy all you can while you can. The next big sell off will be bought up by The West and stay in a bull market. Price doesn't equal value.

If the price goes to $2,000 at least a few big holders will sell a bit and that wealth will trickle down to new users and the price rises. I tank he means everyone has a sell-point. And I don't care if BTC circulates in mass. Bits will be spread throughout societies.

I agree but still think Bernie has a horrible tax policy. I like his positions but like the Ben Carson flat tax proposal. With Bitcoin and the Jobs Act wealth will be created like never before. The biggest issue facing America isn't debt or war or the wealth gap. America is scared to tell the poor the hard truth. We keeping telling the poor that they are that way because of the rich. Majority of the time wealth is created by the people who develop themselves to a greater degree and believe in self actualization. The old industrial society is falling. America is becoming more competitive than ever and you have to continually increases your skill set and service. We make close to a million in our lifetimes and we are scared  of 25k of debt? People need to be told they are doing enough. They need to be told they need to give more to their country , not the other way around. Unfortunately their would be too many voters hurt by this talk so it is avoided altogether. We will get 'there' someday though.

They aren't going to let it die. The best investors and thinkers of our time are behind this movement. They will buy all the Bitcoin and hold for adoption if need be. I think the next Bitcoin bubble will actually come from banking and business purchases. General Electric can utilize Bitcoin for their new tech. Big Corps are all about tax savings and the biggest accounting firms know it. Bitcoin is starting classes in the fall at many prestigious Uni's this is just getting started. Tons of great stocks fail on the run up... This one has low float and is influenced by every major event(which to this point has been mostly negative). We just need ONE person in popular American culture to advocate Bitcoin. I can tell you as a 30 year old there isn't anyone in the space currently that a millennial gives two sh*ts about.

I say build up to 25 or 30 then focus on adding a good dividend stock and one more stock in a innovative market ( ie additive manufacturing). I think that strategy will work flawlessly over 10 years. If a recession hits you can use the Bitcoin appreciation to gobble up cheap dividends. 
The value of a dollar is up for debate but investing in blue chip companies is always going to be the best route.

I am thinking a much higher price long term after a few halving's , but I think it only fell so far because the market wasn't ready. A lot has changed since January.

America is the greatest place but we have an extremely fear based economy and media. Call that self promotion. We need to stop comparing Bitcoin to gold and fiat and blue chip market caps. That is foolish. Bitcoin will outperform all expectations and be the biggest competitor to the dollar within 10 years.

The same men that aspire to be Warren Buffett, and he is great man, will come to crypto. Then what will millenials say?  Knowledge is king in this world now. A protest wont save you. ....

I disagree with a few points .... Barry Silbert is a great young corporate entrepreneur (Secondmarket) and was one of the few ppl telling banks Bitcoin would win when most played it safe saying 'blockchain or ethereum'.... and if Vorhees and Garzik are misguided than the rest of us have no clue to even have an opinion. Just because they aren't on our side of things doesn't make them wrong or misguided. These men are extremely intelligent and have done far more for bitcoin than we give them credit for.

But to be honest I have faith in bitcoin as a long term hold for me. When I hear Andreas, Trace Mayer or Wences say it can be worth $1 million in ten years, I firmly believe that. I am not here because I am half ass convinced. Everyone feels like they have better foresight but this really does feel like "it" to me. And if it fails, oh well I followed some great thinkers with good intentions. Grab a weekend job and double down on whatever's next in life.

Yes it makes sense but you may be crazy. I believe I got this from Trace Mayer, who like Balaji, just gets the idea of bitcoin.... Checkout the 8-layer OSI Model. The "level" your talking about is the transaction layer (8th in the internet evolution). Do your own dd I am far from a tech guy even though I've seen atleast 500 bitcoin videos on youtube lol. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:24:14

@_date: 2015-09-16 19:40:33
Its a stock but doesn't only trade on Nasdaq. It trades on exchanges all over the world so there will be small fluctuations in price depending on where you buy and when. The market doesn't close so constant trading keeps the price moving. I just said don't worry about it because you will never 'pin it down'. When you wake up price could be double. Just buy when you can as much as you can imho. Please say diversify but if anything can be as big as the internet, I say throw all you can afford at it. If it fails, oh well work your ass off and build new wealth and invest in additive manufacturing. If bitcoin goes to the moon and you played it safe you will be looking for the nearest bridge... GL

I think we see stuff like this and immediately get defensive because we love bitcoin, but we have to remember this isn't a zero some game. I listened to an old interview of AE's CEO today and he said the credit market is $7 trillion. The total spending market outside of credit is $25 trillion. Bitcoin will be the premium coin to own while ether and litecoin handle the other transactions. Just a guess...

 I don't know much about mining or computers in general but I would buy this without any doubts. Maybe Balaji is a hustler but his bitcoin knowledge is on another level.

I disagree. ATMs are just now getting set up internationally. It will take time to build that infrastructure but they can leapfrog our banking system. Balaji just released one of the most innovative products I have seen. Maybe you are right and it will die, but for now I will listen to the long list of financial innovators and wealthy entrepreneurs enamored with bitcoin. FYI personal mining should be non-existent in the long haul. I knew that coming in and I know shit about tech lol. "Shits dead" ? Really? Why all of the new Ivy League bitcoin courses then? 9 out of 10 lost money because they invested in something they knew nothing about and bitcoin had no business being worth $1,200. Price has stayed at $230 for 8 months without a killer app. Let's see what Circle and Balaji has planned.

You know when you hear someone speak and can tell they know their sh*t.... that is Patrick Byrne. I seen a speech he did at Overstock and again at Mises, and I believe he already has major banks like ICBC ready to join. I still have a hard time how all this is going to make bitcoin more valuable. It seems like every company trying to setup a platform is trying to keep a few degrees of separation between itself and bitcoin. They say blockchain or sidechain. Never the currency itself it makes me nervous. Why go setup a bitgold if you have so much faith in bitcoin? I hope I'm right..

I blew a few years in my twenties and now I have a kid so I really want to be wealthy in my thirties and enjoy these times. A few trips to Hawaii will do that to a man I suppose. I believe I have the perfect long term investment strategy going forward though.... 3d printing, bitcoin and GE for my dividends... but they will triple too circa 2025.

The competitor to bitcoin will be Ethereum. Not direct competition, but ether has the ability to steal money from new investors.

I think we need to be more humble. We all “know” bitcoin is about to moon. We all “know” bitcoin will repeat its past bear market. But bitcoin has NEVER been at this stage of development. Past markets didn’t have lightning, or this mainstream awareness, or regulatory optimism, or access thru Square, or these buyouts by established players, etc... you have no idea how high it can go but you know it’s growing. You can feel it. Just buy as much as you can imo.

Hip hop is probably the most influential art form in the world. You are gonna make a shit ton of money sir! With all due respect to Kweli and 9th, I think you could grow faster adoption through a more mainstream client like Jay-z and his roc nation label that already personifies the American underdog image. Or maybe a young rebellious group like Rae Sremmurd that can attract the intended 'Dope' audience. Maybe this all defeats the purpose , but it's my free two cents. They need to build a place where people with ideas can bring them to the tech savvy like yourself. I have great ideas that I believe should be materialized. Any who.... Good Luck. This is cool shit!

I think the best advice is to learn everything you can about short term or long term investors from the best in the game ... Then only listen to yourself. You have to get to the point where you trust your own judgement either way because if you listen to us you will hate yourself if it goes to $350 overnight. I am thinking ten even fifteen years out and will accrue through the years no matter the price. Maybe cash out one per year or something like that.

Calm down they are figuring out how to make bitcoin work for your lazy/stupid friends. If MIT kids are still figuring it out , how do you expect the masses to get it yet? This is all part of the hype cycle. Bitcoin needs another few years... 
"Not a single person that I know in real life has initially responded to Bitcoin as something that can benefit the general population, or improve existing entities, etc."
If they never used bitcoin or don't know how it works, how can they make a fair assessment? So why are you listening? Bitcoin will see mass adoption no matter what this sub says but I do agree about the anti-gov stuff. Why talk about your country and stay in it? That's foolish.

Trust yourself and have a gamelan going forward or else you will make dumb ass decisions on the strength of an amateur investors reply. What if I say sell but the post after says buy? Then you made no progress and doubt yourself even more. Win or lose you need to make your own choices. IMO buy when you think it's falling and NEVER sell. Do your homework on economic outlook and judge when or if you should sell. It's a fun game. Probably the most fun of all. GL

Another one of the few good reddit questions that should be answered in the next 6-12 months. 2015 QEs won't make there way to Bitcoin for a while. China is a whole different story ...

 I would put 10 on a trezor, 10 on paper wallets, and 10 in bitcoin certificates or coins. Keep the rest in your online wallets but spread it out.

His class lectures , old nick szabo videos, and just search for the best developers and listen to all the 'reinvent money ' or trace Mayer podcasts you can make time for. There's almost an infinite source of you try to keep up with new developments. Search Bitcoin and subscribe to all the good stuff.

If Visa uses Bitcoin and they are probably the biggest Chase partner, what does that say of their relationship and judgement? The five currencies you listed will keep their place but Bitcoin can become the 6th largest market cap. And all this talk of wars and downfalls is bullshit. China's biggest bank is opening a branch in Seattle and they are buying American real estate by the block lol. once the next industrial revolution starts (next year) we will see who is who...

I ask myself this question daily. I heard someone say it saves banks flight costs? I thought the whole point was to have blockchain with the financial token? If I had the seven and eight figure salaries these bankers had I would be making grown man move right now. The atm network is already laid. Give some away for free... get your customers hooked. I showed my boss the most beautiful Swiss Bitcoin Certificate today and he said " aww that fake money?" I'm done...

watch Wences Cesares he breaks it down very well. Breakdown all its features. Tell him it might be the best invention of his time and have him learn with you. If he doesn't see the "light" you might have to wait. In the meantime keep adding and maybe buy him out later lol. I'm learning people don't take you serious if they make more money...

Dial up internet wasn't practical... this is just getting started be patient. We aren't where you want to be in the hype cycle yet. Bitcoin made a good move with that "Dope" movie. Someone like Kanye West or a young pop artist can break bitcoin wide open.

Dude chill out its called INFRSSTRUCTURE! Wait another 15-24 months. Maybe not even that long... Either way if the price is staying level how in the hell is that failure. Every world currency is worth less than it was worth 9 months ago smh.

Spread it out. Most in trezor, some in coinbase/circle, some on paper wallet/coins/certificates.
@_date: 2015-10-08 04:03:49
It's easier than PayPal already. With all the new tech the world is moving faster and people don't sit and learn anymore. They want to wait until everyone around them is using Bitcoin so they can feel more comfortable if it fails. They are the late ones at the party that came in stumbling. Meanwhile , a risk taker with a Trevor is escorting two women/men to the after party. Same story every decade...

if we don't hear news this week it will suck for the people with faith in BTCS. This merger has been happening for a whole year smh... spondoolies machines are sold out all year long and BTCS share price does nothing but fall... Exactly why I stay away from penny stocks. Something doesn't seem right. Spondoolies seems too far ahead of the comp with their tech and staff to just call it quits. This is where Charles Allen should come out and address investors but most likely will buy up all the cheap shares before releasing any good news. I pulled out at the perfect time as usual hahaha GL

Circle and Coinbase work just fine. I am not scared of losing private keys. That is what offline storage is for. I am not one of you " the world is ending and the banks are going steal our money" types. America is going to continue to lead the world. Whole new markets are emerging and we will lead most if not all. GL
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:35:07
idk I think we should take 100% responsibility. Men set themselves free from themselves and the banks were just looking out for themselves. Many people think tech co's are enslaving to communities because they are making big cities unaffordable. It's not good or bad it's just changed and some are more prepared than others. For me, the measure of success is price stability and useful apps and both are happening. GL
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:02:15
All blacks are criminals ... all cops are crooked... I hate this type of thinking. Stop putting everyone in one box. Did we all forget banks invest in bitoin? Are they criminals too? And what level of negligence have you shown by letting them make you a victim twice? Yes, some bankers rob and steal but so do pastors. Few are masters because many are slaves. That's like saying credit is evil. You can default and slavishly pay your life away, or show integrity and experience amenities few men ever know. Its not all or nothing. Bitcoin has no enemies.

They partnered with BTCS for a transaction verification company and the stock is at $0.16.... I would keep an eye on it going forward. And no I am not a holder or pumper this is just good ol fashion American love! Lol

Bitcoin Suisse Certificate aka beautiful paper wallet...and I love the Titan, Infinitum, and Alitin Coins. I like all forms of Bitcoin. I think I put some on art in the future.... I know it's stupid to trust a 3rd party blah blah. I love rare stuff and not all of them will steal. Reputations will be key in this industry.

Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 in ten years. Nobody here knows what will happen six months out, so how can they tell you the price a year from now. The best minds in bitcoin are doing more than all of us combined. Trust their optimism. Half of all your investing money over the next 5 years should go to bitcoin given its potential and your age. Find a few more investments you believe in and you will do fine. GL

New York bankers just had the option as of this week. We need that institutional investment for accountants and lower level CFAs to advise consumers. And then point them to use case apps for titles and identification in other countries. Give expansion and growth another year. All game changers take about 7-10 years. We are year five.

I saw Nas invested in Coinbase. I am looking forward to a pop culture/shopping catalyst to keep price momentum through winter and the halving to carry price thereafter. A bitcoin company needs to go after Jay-z at Tidal. He is the most influential black man in America and a non-conformist agenda. It would play out well with the artist he has backing him. I would love to work for a financial consulting company....
