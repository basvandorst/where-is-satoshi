@_date: 2019-07-05 21:04:41

So you get upset when someone "insults" you, but you won't clarify why you called me rude? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:58:16
oh hey look it's alt
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:25:28
In what way is that comment rude, exactly?
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:36:14
You still haven't explained why you called *me* "a rude person". 
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:44:20


He does this all the time and he thinks no one notices lol. Right @_date: 2018-12-11 23:34:42
Lol this is exactly what I'm talking about, it upsets you
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:44:05
How is it off topic when you use your alts to upvote your bitcoin comments? You really think that all your editing and deleting works lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:37:02
Which part did I lie about,  are all you?
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:25:26
Enjoy [this thread]( of me dealing with him yesterday
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:17:21
his alts and say otherwise lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:15:53
I'm not the one who "focuses on bitcoin" by using alts lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:07:21
Lol you're the one who has no idea how reddit works  are all you, no matter how much you try to edit or delete your comments
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:39:50
is his latest lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:56:45
I'll just state again, are all the same person :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:54:23
 are all you, that's all I need to say :)
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:51:21
He would prefer to be known as @_date: 2018-12-11 06:59:36
Lol I'm not trying to insult you, I just think it's weird you're pretending aren't all you
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:13:08
I haven't "been rude to you", all I've pointed out is that are all the same person, which has seem to upset you :)
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:23:08
So you can't link to where I've personally insulted you, yet I could provide several links (until you edit/delete as usual) to where you've personally insulted me. And yes those are your alts :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:20:31
you seem upset
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:18:20
&amp; are his alts lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:12:45
I don't think "everyone on here has multiple secret identities", it's just that you have multiple obvious alts :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:29:06
Cool, you're not upset that are obviously the same person :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:44:23
*conspiracy  *that's   *here    
Your accounts are literally linked to each other :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:43:40
Getting more and more awkward the more you deny it 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:18:13
Dont forget about his alts @_date: 2018-12-11 05:35:10
You're literally pretending you don't know who your alts are. That's really awkward of you.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:52:27
I thought you were against personal insults and *only* wanted to talk about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:44:53
Cool, so personal insults are fine with you and your alts
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:46:52
? You're still pretending those aren't you? Ouch. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:08:19
Please link to where I have "personally insulted you", you've certainly tried to hard to insult me.  All I've said is that your alts are obvious. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:34:43
lol way to dodge answering any questions
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:30:06
I'm not denying that are all you, which has caused you to personally insult me for some reason.
