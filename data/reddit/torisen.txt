No, you're mining the fusion core of our sun for profit.

Sweet! Didn't purchase (I can't buy the Vive through Steam and there's nothing else I want right this second), but I see it in the checkout screen now! I'll have to browse for some new stuff to pick up tonight!

Shit, you're right!
Not kidding, just got fucked for $5k to the IRS (in addition to 0 withholding +$50 a payday from my wife and I). I was supposed to get a Vive for my birthday in August but had trashed that possibility.
I've got like 3 BTC and change from buying bits over the last few years. I actually do get one! I didn't even think of that when I saw OP's post until you mentioned it!

Yeah, check the pic, you can see it saying up to date.

Not for everyone (in the US) yet. I got all excited and... [NOTHING]( :(
@_date: 2016-04-26 04:15:58
I assume they're in the EU somewhere since they said 10€.
The on thing different from the US poster above me is the BTC option. Made sure my steam client was current and checked the web interface as well, nothing.
I'd love to know what I'm missing here, super excited to use BTC on Steam.

Alas poor Yorick, I think you misread. I'm pretty sure he's talking about the EU in direct response to pascalbrax. 
Nowhere in his reply does he refer to the US in any way, he specifically mentions the EU on the verge of collapse before mentioning other shortfalls/

So how would your


feel about paying more for goods and services? Isn't the min wage+ argument that they can't afford things as it is?

That's kind of my point, we did fight to gain freedom and rights, but a couple decades back big business and corporations essentially declared a quiet war on the population and a took a while before anyone noticed.
Our parents and their parents thought the government was working for us and let them set the groundwork for the last 10-15 years of not even having to hide their actions, and there's very little we can do.
So it's a little late to realize we're fighting an antagonistic force and even seeing the constant onslaught our population is still bickering about voting red or blue like that's making any difference as we all slowly get rolled under worse and worse laws and regulations.

Does no one else see the irony in this post? OP is butthurt about not making money (rebate points) and doesnt understand that Gyft did it to make money?
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:37:25
Personally I'm just getting tired of having to fight erosion of rights on EVERY front here in the US. SOPA/CISPA/ACTA, US FBI arresting a New Zealand citizen (in New Zealand) for a civil infraction (not even criminal here, let alone there), Illegal wiretapping under Bush that Obama didn't stop, just made legal, NSA not just watching everything we do but acting to compromise encryption algorithms and specific chipsets to make doing it easier for them (and now everyone else that knows those back doors are wide open).
Shouldn't being part of a "free country" we shouldn't have march and petition and call and write online pleas ***EVERY DAY*** just to not slide deeper into this morass?
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:34:55
You know, this is a really interesting question, and it gets moreso the deeper you imagine it out.
I vote libertarian for all the good it's doing, and I have friends and family both red and blue that I talk politics with. One thing that irritates me is the logical inconsistency of "their guy is in office, he's ruining the country" and in the next breath "Our guy is in office, but he can't do anything because of [insert filibuster, congress member, etc]". Either the president has the power to step in and make changes or we should abolish the office. The way the system was built, the office of the president has power roughly equal to congress or the supreme court, and the office also has the advantage of allowing a single person make a case to the other branches or the public. 
Now something we've seen in the last couple decades or so is instead of being three individual branches that act on their own best moral judgement and move to curb, restrain, and correct actions of the other branches as they were designed, politics has turned into a lucrative career and the three branches have colluded to allow the others more power and freedom to increase both their benefits (direct income: paychecks, indirect income: health/retirement, lobbyist and special income, and post-government employment deals, and powerbase enhancement: favors owed and "friends" both foreign and domestic that can be called on during or after employment). The downside of this (other than we the people getting thrown under the bus to achieve it) is that now the previously clear checks and balances are so muddied that no one branch can really defy another as they were intended to and there's a lot of money and power involved for all three branches in these agencies (FBI/NSA/CIA) overreaching, I'm not sure which direction would be most expedient, but realistically, if Obama even moved towards censuring these actions he would be deposed or neutered (politically... probably) in short order, something that wouldn't have been able to happen (at least not as easily) if the system had functioned as intended and the three branches had stayed distinct.
However, imagine what the american people would do if a president (it might have to be a new guy/gal, Obama may have burned too many bridges for people to believe his sincerity at this point) were to go out live on every channel and tell the people they were sorry for letting it go so far and it needed to change, then ask for support in cutting back to most corrupt actions, making the agencies behave, giving our citizens rights back, etc.? Just honestly laid their political career on the chopping block and told the people whose hands were in the wrong pockets and which big businesses were toeing the line with immoral/illegal lobbying and pressure for "favorable legislation" and sttod up and asked the people to back him in fixing it.
Barring assassination, which would be a very real threat, and massive smear campaigns on many news outlets owned wholly or in part by those very rich people who like getting richer every day and having massive pull with government, I'm just optimistic enough that I think the people could and would move to help them, even if the other two branches acted to stop them I think massive popular opinion and action with a president that cared more about making a change than making a career could bring a huge reform in a short time, though it wouldn't bring them anywhere near the income the president makes in the current scenario.
It's a lot to ask them to give up, and it's legitimately difficult to say that I would give up the power and money in their place, on the hope the people would believe and back me. But if it keeps going the way is has been, I think it may be too late for us, it'll take a while, but our end may already be difficult, if not impossible, to avoid. Every branch and many agencies have been outed to immoral or outright illegal actions against we the people and foreign nationals and the most that has happened when it's been made public has been an adjustment of the law to allow their actions, and often not even that.
TL:DR; What I think would happen right now if Obama took action against the alphabet soup agencies would be an erosion of political capital and likely income. The harder he pushed, the worse the loss, I think he would have enough power to make dramatic changes, but his future as a president and after would be severely crippled.

Same here. I got nothing. When I used [GOOGLE]( to search their site I found [THIS BLOG ENTRY]( that looks like you have to search flights then it gives you some train options but I can't for the life of me get it to show me the Amtrak route that runs from Olympia, WA to Portland, OR. Or any Amtrak routes at all.

I've been a fan of both [Surfrider Foundation]( and [Habitat for Humanity]( but it looks like nither one takes BTC yet. :(

Already bought two copies (one for me and one for the wife) with bitcoin and a 20% off coupon last week.
Redeemed on steam and preloaded this weekend, ready for tomorrow.

Look at what is currently happening in Venezuela. People leaving the country are searched and robbed. Multiple people leaving have made comments about Bitcoin being the only way they got out with anything.

Cash on hand might work, no-one trusts random checks these days, if banks are down, people are fooked. People seem to think the local grocery store is going to pull out scales and take gold or silver shavings for life sustaining food and water. You might get someone to give you a couple bags for a Troy ounce, but gold and silver have no intrinsic value and the only way to spend it if shit gets ugly is at a heavy loss to someone that has actual valuables. Or more likely get robbed/mugged/murdered when someone hears you're trying to spend it.
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:52:40
Do you think that if the modern word shit the bed and you have gold and someone else has food that they will take your useless gold in trade for their food and starve?
