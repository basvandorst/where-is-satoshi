Yep, that's the only source of problems with bitcoin. Fees were on average a few bucks before the Bcash bitcoin split. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:09:07
"alt bitcoin"? Is this the latest way to refer to bcash? I need to update my slang dictionary. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:55:08
This seems like a public pressure campaign. I mean, why should we as bitcoiners be judging their business practices beyond the user experience. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:42:34
That sounds like decidedly not clearing. Why that level? It's either clear or not. Decreasing to a level you deem low enough? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:09:34
Crimes? What a word! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:55:53
It will be too late, it seems. Segwit was supposed to fix things too. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:11:19
That's exactly it. If one company is sending too many wire transfers, and it slowed down other wire transfers, who in their right mind would say that we need to boycott them? This whole line of argument just avoids the obvious problem with bitcoin: the high fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:00:00
Well, that's just like, your opinion man. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:16:08
It hasn't become fake overnight. You're discounting how much work it has been to disable bitcoin. It took years and dozens of people to do that. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:13:03
That will never happen again, and this whole sub needs to come to grips with that reality. It's a crowded space and bitcoin is taking a match to its first-mover advantage. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:15:00
RemindMe! 1 year. 




@_date: 2018-01-20 21:05:37
Almost always clears? The mempool has barely dropped below 100,000 unconfirmed transactions for a month.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:58:18
Fees on their way down! Oh wait, node count is more than sufficient and has been for years. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:54:18
Like getting merchant un-adoption? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:59:44
I just need a math degree and a crystal ball to calculate the proper fee, it seems. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:58:28
Right. I just wondered. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:17:17
I don't know. That proposal seems only to try and stretch the Overton window. Can't imagine that many actually think blocks should be smaller. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:51:28
Maybe if LN was more than a glimmer in someone's eye, there would be a point. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:06:21
I'm sure their transaction was not very important. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:56:45
There are not hundreds of developers active in development 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:59:23
More possible transactions, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:20:38
They created? You cannot believe that they are the reason for high fees and low transaction volume? Only the miners and core devs can possibly be blamed for that. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:56:33
They're friction, and bad. Who wants more friction for each transaction?

@_date: 2014-11-02 15:35:37
That's just one effect. The prices of sellers and buyers define the price and more transactions, if balanced, would not substantially change the price. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:31:04
Thanks. 
In short, my response is that these guys can fuck right off. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:41:59
It still is. 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-21 22:22:53

Kiva does not allow interest, so that's a huge difference. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:34:53
Probably. If only someone would save me from my noobness! 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:00:25
Seriously? The value of a thing is determined by all the people who buy and sell it. Right now, the USD is the reserve currency of the world, and bitcoin is still a very small niche.

@_date: 2015-01-14 15:26:15
Will we feel the same way when bitcoin is 3 bucks and we're desperately trying to figure out how to get into the crypto of the future, Paycoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:28:35
I can't help but cry. I should have bought more at sixty when Gox still lived.... 
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:34:24
If you don't like it, don't buy it. Simple as.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:27:29
Someone shake OP, he's in a dream. We're in his dream. I'm in his dream. This is weird. Hopefully he doesn't ask me to get into his car.

I think he has many African leaders that like him, and giving their citizens a way to avoid taxes would not be popular with them. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:14:48
Probably still better than Paycoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:47:14
Hard to outsmart the market. If they're worth more to you than the price you can buy them for, go ahead. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:41:18

Well, you're the Bitcoin CFO so you're pretty crucial. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:08:35
Yep, there are probably people who push the price up just to see who's up there. It would help them plan for the future after prices rise. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 02:33:31
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:20:54
Because things like that are always sold. I get propositioned to buy food stamps all the time. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:02:08
If we assume the market was free and not coerced, and that both parties made the transaction, we can therefore assume that they are better off (in their own estimation) than they were before the transaction.  Thus, they have more wealth than beforehand.
It seems like you're talking about the moral boundaries that should define what bitcoin is used for.  It is largely used for investment, remittance across borders and buying things that are highly regulated and/or illegal.  This falls in the third category.  Whether people "should" pay camgirls in bitcoin is kind of your opinion, and really doesn't say anything except positively about the value of bitcoin, which in this case allows them to make a transaction that otherwise would not occur.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:01:08
Like Yogi Berra famously said, "Noone goes there anymore, it's too crowded!"
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:57:25
Fuck Yeah! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:24:55
The current message from many core supporters is to make a decision about the 2x part later instead of dealing with the compromise as a package deal, you know, the way it was sold. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:16:40
And it was cleared in about an hour. Low fees transactions are not as damaging with larger blocksizes, everything else remaining equal.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:31:33
Yeah, wait until fees are higher, blocks are slower and mempool doubles. 
Just because you always can do something later, that doesn't mean at all that you should wait. The segwit2x compromise where one side got what they wanted first and now they're not giving the other side what they wanted. It's a bait-and-switch. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:25:45
Ok. Then I guess they should ignore the miners then. They're not that important when you really think about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:03:19
in four months! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:33:24
You forgot 3b) they gain mining profitability over you and take your mining hash power. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:35:53
The compromise was a good first step with huge majority approval. Then they re-neg! It's bizarre. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:42:11
I've used BTCJam for about a year. Honestly, there are too many scammers to try and just do a few loans. I recently joined their autoinvest program but we'll see how it goes. It's risky, and go in knowing you could lose. I think overall I'm up a few percent, but it's an evolving market and will get better with time I'm sure. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:58:23
Yes. There is more risk than that, and there is no reward without risk. Look at their autoinvest program. I think they still will underperformed those estimates, but they are based on previous loans. They have standardized rates so that the users cannot set them. Not sure if that will help or hurt.

I'd love a question asked of him during the debate. "What would you do if you were the president of Venezuela, and how would that help?" 
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:27:44
I watched one, worked well, took about 10 seconds for confirmation through non-coinbase, so that's good.
Hope this becomes a new model!
I'd also love it if there were channels that gave free views if someone paid more money.  Like, pay $0.50 and the next 10 views are free. You'd get people who didn't want to pay, and some paying for their views.  More exposure, more money potentially, since those free viewers would never pay anyways. Anywho, just a thought.
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:51:47
I know about everything.  Please refrain from trying  from the 2017 plan. You've been warned.
@_date: 2016-02-19 02:33:43
Norway is economically free, relatively capitalist with a very strong welfare state. The government does not own the economy or run stores or the currency rate, it's just not very comparable to the dictatorship of Venezuela. 
Norway ranks 32 worldwide in economic freedom per Heritage Foundation. 
Venezuela is 176, beating only North Korea and Cuba, which are basically in the stone age compared to Norway. 
Economic freedom is not a perfect corrolary for socialism, but socialism needs a decrease in it to implement their top-down policies. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:11:32
What a world we live in. Good luck! 
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:54:20
That's very generous. You really believe cronyism can cause currencies to tumble and the entire economy to collapse? I think the amount of corruption there is unlikely to have done so. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:23:31
Its obvious that corruption is a big issue there, but I have three pieces of evidence for that thought: we know that socialism allows the corrupt government to control who owns the economy, and they get huge and even more direct benefits than in capitalist economies. Look no further than the richest people in Venezuela all being politicians or their families. People who supposedly are controlling the economy for the people's benefit are getting rich, and the system is allowing them to do that without interference. The other evidence is that this kind of total collapse is somewhat counter balanced by the existence of capitalism. African countries often do not have the conditions that compose a free market, and it's hard to separate that from the effects of corruption, foreign aid, and other effects. Countries like India have rampant corruption but are thriving economies, demonstrating to me the primacy of the market as a force to allow other means of enriching yourself other than taking control of the government. Thirdly, controlling the currency can lead to money printing by the government and cause inflation to run rampant. Even corrupt politicians cannot print money without the consent of the central banks. 
Corruption is certainly a factor, but I believe it's less important than the "corruption" of giving a group of individuals control of all the economy. That is, after all, the ultimate goal of nearly all corruption, and in socialist countries, as practiced, they start with this end goal.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:27:22
Yes, but other people have mentioned that it's far more costly to do this. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:20:49

You're one lucky bastard. Congrats! 
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:07:18
Did I need it?  We all know that they will only raise rates when it's the only option, and no sooner.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:58:44
Eventually, they will raise rates.  Surely, FED delivers, we just need to wait.
Edit: /s
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:02:08
I don't think so.  There are those in this community thinking about these issues, but honestly, it's about incentives to use the currency, and I doubt that politics alone will drive many to do so.  It'll have to be that holding bitcoins is preferable to holding dollars, and I think that will slowly change over time, but I wouldn't expect Joe Blow to ask for his paycheck in bitcoin because he philisophically disagrees with government inflation targetting.

I got the same notice.  Awful.  I want to transfer more to Mt. Gox, actually, so I wonder how I can do that other than a wire transfer.  They seem to suggest the accounts have been seized, but I don't know the details of that company and Mt. Gox to know exactly what this means.
