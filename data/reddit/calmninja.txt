Bitcoin and Wholefoods is like peanut butter and jelly. Organic peanut butter and jelly of course.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:48:16
Maybe it helps to point out that we (customers) will actually use it.
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:57:25
Accepting it at self-cashout registers first would be a solution to that problem. Stores would love to see people use self-cashout registers more anyways.
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:47:03


There aren't that few of us either and we are growing by the day.


Online is without a doubt much easier to implement. But, I don't see why we should stop there. Besides, this might convert Wholefoods high-ups into Bitcoiners.

Use the cube on them.  It works every time, lol. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:43:23
Wow, a link from OMG. Success!!! LOL
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:50:13
Why don't you stop complaining and start taking action. Even though my method may not be the best it got Wholefoods to join the conversation.  Why don't you ask  You may be right about both steps being able to be implemented simultaneously. Find out. 
Feel free to join the conversation.

I do plan on using Bitcoin at Wholefoods if/when it becomes an option.


It would make sense if they implemented it on self-checkout registers first and then moved it to regular registers if/when popularity rises.  It costs them virtually nothing to do this and it makes me happy as a customer.  Also, every customer the uses Bitcoin could have potentially used a credit card which is more expensive then using Bitcoin.  Win, win.

Sorry I missed that. I didn't mean to attack you. BTW, nice title: "Government Actually Looking Out For Us?"

I didn't mean to offend or call you out.  I take vitamins very rarely.  Instead, I eat whole foods (no processed foods).  Sure, I cheat sometimes but I try my best.  I am at optimal weight and have no health issues.  But, what you eat is only one part of the equation anyways.  
BTW, I am familiar with the "Paleo Diet".  Being healthy is a lifestyle choice.  Diets are all BS.  You don't need to buy a book or a product that tells you what and how to eat.  Just research what the healthiest cultures in the world eat.  As, I said though, I am not trying to call you out or offend you.  My intention was to help.  But at the end of the day, you do you and I will do me.

hahhaha  
I set myself up for that one.

Or Whole Bitcoin Wallet, lol.
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:43:57
Adapting it at self checkout would be a minimal cost to Wholefoods therefore only a few customers would need to use it for it to benefit Wholefoods.
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:18:52
Title copied from YouTube. Lazy I guess.
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:05:11
Was this an isolated incident? Is it unthinkable that the scale wasn't calibrated? BTW, what is the ratio of good news to bad news that the media puts out.  
We should make an agency to regulate this. Then we should make another regulating agency to regulate the first regulating agency and so on.  By the time we are done, nobody will be unemployed *facepalm
@_date: 2014-09-01 06:25:41
I appreciate your sincere comment.  My intention is not to piss of the place where I like to shop at or anybody at &gt; Multiple individuals all saying the same thing to them at the same time looks no different than spam
[definition of spamming](  
* My contact to Wholefoods is NOT **unsolicited**. - ("We want to satisfy and delight our customers - every single one." [source]( I am a customer and it would delight and satisfy me if Wholefoods accepted my preferred form of payment.  
* I am not **advertising indiscriminately**. - Advertising implies getting paid for promoting something.  Nobody is paying me. As a matter of fact, I am paying Wholefoods.  If I am trying to gain from the value of Bitcoin going up, why am I giving it away?  Also, by now we all know that big companies accepting Bitcoin puts sell pressure on the market. Therefor, I am NOT doing myself a favor (as an investor) if I make my investment depreciate.  
My actions are not indiscriminate. I am only asking companies **where I shop at** to accept my preferred form of payment.  
.  
Would this make protesters or any other organized group trying to accomplish something spammers? (not trying to be a smart ass)
How do you propose I (by my self) try to get Wholefoods (large corporation) to accept Bitcoin (my preferred form of payment)?  
.  


 
The biggest orchestrated scam in the world is central bank controlled fiat money.  Yet, I get accused of organizing a spam campaign for trying to get a grocery store, where I shop at, to accept my preferred form of payment.  I am either missing something or I am an evil ninja ;)
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:38:38
Apperently, I am a evel ninja.  Maybe he thinks that I am the CEO of Bitcoin, lol. Trolls will be trolls ;)
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:54:01
Nicely put. Thank you for joining the conversation.
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:24:05
Now it all makes sense. Poor guy, lol.
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:40:13

@_date: 2014-09-25 05:05:10
Neither do I.  I hope they get it done soon. I need a gift card.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:06:14
I love win-win situations.
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:28:22
Did you know that Walmart also sells some non-gmo foods?  DYOR before you buy a product.  Also, Wholefoods carries many brands that are not available at Walmart.  
I have no problem paying a bit more at WholeFoods knowing that they pay and treat their employees good.  Not to mention, they support local farmers.  You vote with your money and Wholefoods, even though they may not be perfect, get my vote over Walmart every time.  BTW, good luck trying to find a Walmart associate that will be as helpful as a Wholefoods associate.  Also, go to Wholefoods and look around. How many overweight and unhealthy people do you see?  Then go do the same at Walmart.  This is why I like to shop there.
Keep in mind.  If you don't like something at your grocery store let them know.  I always do.  Change the world don't let the world change you.


@_date: 2014-09-01 14:38:30
Agreed. But, without a first step there is no second step. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:13:25
It may be difficult by it is worth the try.
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:36:30
Busted ;)

People need to stop assuming these days.  Check, ask, research.  If you are not willing to do that, you will pay for your ignorance.  It's the way this world works.  As far as I am concerned, I am willing to pay more for the same product in order to reward a company that takes care of their employees. They even give you a bigger employee discount if you are taking care of your health. 


The worst part is that even honest farmers and food coops can't always know that they are selling your organic food that has been cross contaminated with GMO food.


I am very jellos of you. You spoiled brat ;)
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:47:18
Donald Trump, lol. I like you bet.
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:41:45
Self checkout machines already exist at some Wholefoods stores.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:13:46
I guessed as much. No worries.
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:41:49
When will mainstream media understand that Bitcoin has no bank?
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:11:11


Unfortunately, I don't. I wish.


1) I was not aware of this. 2) I never said that Wholefoods was perfect.  It is the my preferred place to buy groceries because it is the fastest and most convenient way for me to get the products I want.


Isn't every grocery store that sells GMO products in a way supporting Monsanto.


If it is labeled as non-GMO or organic and they willingly label it otherwise then this is unethical.  But, if it is not labels as such I see no issue with that.  Every business sells their customers what they want to buy.  This is the only way a business can stay profitable.  Also, you have to understand that even when something is labeled as organic it my be cross contaminated with GMOs because of nearby non-organic farmers.  At this point Monsanto fuck up the food supply so bad that we may never truly know if any of our food is entirely non-GMO.  


If they treat their employs well they are already not upholding the status quo in that sense.  You need to understand that it is not easy to completely stop supporting the status quo as a business.  Example: If Wholefoods stopped accepting credit cards which produce profits for the banks (status quo) they would go out of business.  People support unethical bank practices by using their products. Therefor, we can not put all the blame on companies which are by design created to be profitable.

* Overeating and white refined grains and sugar makes you fat.
* Not getting enough exercise makes you fat.  
* Being toxic makes you fat.  
* Trans fats make you fat.  
It's easy to blame being overweight on one or two things (bread/grains).
BTW, did you ever do some research on the quality of your vitamins?  Do this. Google: "danger of low quality vitamins".  **Cheaper does not always equal better.**  Always do your own research before you put something in your mouth.
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:26:48
Agreed. Local is always best for so many reasons.
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:23:22
I don't disagree with the Paleo diet.  I just don't like to put label on it so somebody can sell books and products.  Common sense is free.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:14:47
I prefer that point to be sooner then later.
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:56:51
I can of course appreciate what you are saying but seeing BTC accepted inside a Wholefoods store would add to BTCs credibility.  Sure, Bitcoin is a great internet currency but why not make it THE currency (internet and real world).


Agreed but this can be done alongside pushing BTC to major online merchants. It takes very little effort to tweet, retweet, email and call. I am happy to spend my energy on this.
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:51:05
Thanks for the reply. That makes sense.
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:21:20
It just seems wrong to me. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:40:41
Sure. But, Wholefoods accepting BTC in stores would be great publicity for Bitcoin. Also, not all Wholefoods customers know about Gyft.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:44:34
It is more convenient for me to spend in the store then buy a giftcard online first. I am sure many others will agree.
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:49:12
It is true. I just tried to buy a gift card on there and caught it. There is a picture in the tweet.

Oh I see what you mean. I missed that. I am assuming that he means people who bought on Zencloud and Paybase. There is no way that he will cover everyone on the exchanges. There would be to much room for abuse. 
I agree with you that there shouldn't have been a floor promised and that they could have held it longer but it is what it is now. Let's see how it plays out. I do give him kudos for not hiding from reddit.

reimburse - repay (a person who has spent or lost money).
It doesn't mean he will give people their money back plus profits.

Keep it up. Everybody has a limit to how many NOs they can give before it's a YES. We just have to find that limit.
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:21:40
Well, they have unlimited supply so it could work. LOL
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:22:02
