Thank you for the valuable advice my friend I will give some.of my time and attention to saifedean and see whats up. Some of those shitcoins can potentially give people 100x gains and thats good for people less fortunate than others. It can spark motivation and interest for a person from the ghettos and slums to adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

Spreading awesomeness world wide in real time with real people not sitting behind a screen. Me and my team are willing to go preach the gospel in the slums in the ghettos where most people have never been. similar to the jehovah witnesses or mormons but for Crypto and Blockchain.
