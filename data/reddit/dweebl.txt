Just to illustrate the way that some people understand BTC, I just had someone on facebook reach out to me for advice on investing in it and I asked "What do you already know?"
He said "i know the government started it for nerds really its mostly used for illegal use as the dark web i know you buy a bitcoin for say like 1000 and you can buy stuff"
Reminded me we're nowhere near mainstream understanding.

What if you don't buy it and are just paid in bitcoin?

Can't tell if you're trolling but in case people are reading this, it isn't true and you *can* make bitcoin transactions anonymously.

Yeah it's pretty obvious he played the market. Which I'm stoked on because it meant I could get in some more at 3500.

Did you used to be able to go to the bank and say "I want the gold that my money is worth"?
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:52:36
Oh true there's no trails on the headlights. The brightness of the windows on the bottom floor makes it look like the sun is in there though. I stand corrected.

It's also a pretty slow-shutter photo so it would have been pretty dim.
