How could it be fishy?? Most exchanges were struggling to keep up with less users. Think of the issues they would have as more users pour in. They need time to hire more staff, and make upgrades to the sites and servers.

use gdax to send btc for free.

Deposit money from your bank to your coinbase USD wallet. Once you receive the funds, go over to gdax and "deposit" USD. There will be an option to deposit funds from your coinbase USD wallet to your GDAX one, for free.
After you buy what you wanted to, withdrawals are completely free.

NEO will be fine, as it is a smart contracts platform as opposed to a currency.  Vertcoin and Iota, not so sure that they will be fine.  Who knows.

Localbitcoin premiums are worse than coinbase...  honestly I think GDAX is the absolute best way to get bitcoin.  No fees, not even to send to a personal wallet

Need to have that next to quite a few more, TBH.  But it's a great start.

Not really a point in buying BTC with such a small amount, you won't be able to do anything with it.
You can buy using a credit card on coinbase but there will be fees

Coinbase -&gt; Withdraw from Bank &amp; Wait -&gt; GDAX withdraw USD from Coinbase USD wallet -&gt; Buy BTC using "Limit" order to pay no fees
