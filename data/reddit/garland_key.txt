Tone Veys says that it's time to get bearish.  He sees a trend to fall $9,300 and that if it reaches that point, it will continue to spiral downward.  He says it could potentially go as low as $1,500 if the spiral happens. He attributes the recent Tether scamcoin pump and FOMO.

1. It's not disingenuous - I was actually over estimating.  I run a full node and encrypted wallet from a $35 raspberry pi, a $5 phone charger and a $50 usb hard drive.  The raspi can run with 24/7/365 uptime for about $10 a year in electricity.

You don't have enough information to pinpoint the motivation of OP. He has stated a grievance with Coinbase, but the utility of his grievance is great. So, it's good that things like this are called out so that those of us who don't use them can know about it and warn others.

Everyone who is able to run a node is in power.  The bar is low at under $100 to set one up, or free if you already have a computer.

@_date: 2018-01-22 19:08:17


No worries - just take the time to actually learn how bitcoin started, where it has been and where it is going and you'll probably figure it out.


If you look at the overall pattern of growth for bitcoin, it will remain profitable for miners, likely up until the very last coin. Since we can't predict the future, it's possible that this problem will arise, but if it does, we can't even be sure that will negatively impact the function or value of bitcoin at that time.


It makes plenty of sense, has been done in the past and has been successful in the past. That said, the chances of bitcoin dropping significantly at all is highly unlikely -- only quantum attacks could kill it at this point AFAIK.


You were claiming that a floor value doesn't exist. That is only true in the way that nothing can have a floor value because it's possible that there is so little demand for *X* that it's worthless. In any other form of reasoning, it does exist. For example, a drug dealer can't sell their *drugX* for less than $15 an ounce because that is how much it cost them per ounce to manufacture. Therefore, the price will always remain above that base level or it will no longer be manufactured.  
All that to say, it sounds like you're arguing semantics in order to sound smart and allow yourself to pat yourself on the back.

You're talking about centralized pump and dump shitcoins and I'm talking about an organically formed, decentralized Bitcoin.
That said, it's very unlikely that bitcoin will ever drop below mining profitability based on the long term market trend / projections.  Bitcoin has the momentum and the security to outlast the alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:33:00

Jesus - you're asking me to provide logical explanations for something that's obviously subjective.  I don't know how to do that.
I think Roger is a winner. I think that he's out there everyday slinging shitcoins, networking, propagandizing and disrupting bitcoin.  Because he is wealthy, he has the influence and resources to make real shit happen. If you need evidence of that, just look a BCash right now - look at - look at bitcoin.com.
We have nobody combating Roger's bad behavior.  We collectively laugh him off, while a few of us in the background imagine ways to prevent some of the slimier shit that he is guilty of.


Perhaps, but I think it also has to do with people not knowing any better and Roger having the influence to get on these shows in the first place - he is likely reaching out to them. He was just on Dave Rubin a few weeks ago and now this? He is on a Crusade against Bitcoin, but that old mantra still applies: First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win -- we're at that laugh at you phase with him.

I disagree with the notion that nothing matters but the software. Without people, there is no software.  Without community, bitcoin protocol doesn't run.  Without community, there is nobody to decide how bitcoin will behave.
I don't understand your sheep statement - it seems like a clever phrase meant to make you feel smart with little meaning behind it.  Everyone is susceptible to their human condition - especially you.
It's hard to know what is what when people are trying to fool you and there aren't enough people pointing it out.

@_date: 2017-12-15 02:48:35
Buddy, you can't just expect this software to work on scale with people's greed or demands. Good design and bug-free coding takes a lot of time and care.
This is fundamentally where the old block size debate rested. Big investors like Roger wanted it to be ready for world wide adoption NOW and they were willing to accept poor design that would eventually kill Bitcoin to get it.
Bitcoin isn't ready yet, whether you like it or not.  So, for now you'll still have to use Visa.  Deal with it.

People used to ignore Roger. Now people laugh at Roger. Soon people will fight Roger. Then people may lose.
Whether you like it or not, Roger Ver is a winner. He is out there everyday busting his ass to sling his latest shitcoin, network and disrupt Bitcoin. On top of that, he's rich AF and has the power and resources to make shit happen.
If you're scoffing at that, then please look at the BCash price - - bitcoin.com - his recent series of major television and youtube appearances where is did nothing but confuse BCash with Bitcoin.
When is it time to fight? We need to be more organized and more vigilant. We're a community and the community is what makes Bitcoin work.

You can make a device that looks and is packaged exactly like a Trezor.  To someone shopping at Walmart.com for bitcoin deviced, they aren't going to know that you're supposed to go to wallet.trezor.io.  An attacker would be clever enough to instruct the users to go to a similar but different url, such as trezor.wallet.uk or something like that.  The site would look similar and would mimic similar behavior, but instead all addresses, wallets and balances are seen by the attacker.

No creativity I guess.  You don't have it connect with Trezor's officials software.  You have it connect with software that looks exactly like Trezor's official software, but is actually connecting to a phishing site.  So you create a phishing URL like Trezor.wallet.se or something like that.  You print out a pretty user's guide that requests that they connect to that address.  User buys said device and you get their money. Then user deposits bitcoin and you get that too.  You being a new user hate bitcoin forever.

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:04




Again - it's not current centralization that you should be worried about.  If you double the block size, then you're cutting the amount of time that average users will be able to run a node in half - so on, so forth.  Math.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:11:18
Again - this has been explained ad nauseum.  You're essentially doubling the amount of data that needs to be stored for each node that allows Bitcoin to operate. Just because it isn't a problem now doesn't mean it won't be in the future.  By doubling block size, you're halving the time it will take to reach the point that average income people will be unable to run a bitcoin node.  This is math - not a debate.
It also compromises the decentralization of mining as well. Larger blocks increase means greater latency, which provides an incentive to localize miners into a cluster to get quickest access to the next block (much in the same way day traders do). Smaller blocks keep latency lower.

1. I don't hate Roger, but I'm not okay with what he is doing. I've known people like him in my person life, so I'm hyper aware of what he's doing - I have a personal interest in it.
2. Above all else, I'm a skeptic - I hold logic up as my most important tool in life. I'm well read on propaganda and power. Objectively, Bitcoin Cash is unsustainable. Objectively, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Objectively, Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Core. Objectively, newcomers are being confused by this. Objectively, Roger Ver, and bitcoin.com are participating in a fraud of their own making - regardless of the motivations, it is wrong and should be addressed.

The battle never stopped - it's not about bcash, it's about Roger Ver using his standing to damage bitcoin and to further his stake in the cryptocurrency community. He's using bitcoin.com,  and to conflate bitcoin and bitcoin cash to newcomers who don't know any better. He's even been on national television spouting this horse shit. He twists the truth and focuses on specific talking points and never deviates from them. He knows bcash isn't sustainable but he doesn't care - he would have picked whatever coin that still stood after the dust settled.

I dunno - I'm a classic liberal and I disagree with Anarchists almost 100% except on the fundamental notion that you should question the legitimacy of power any time it exists - not to say it should exist, but its existence should be justified.
I don't agree with sjws and their lack of critical thought.  I don't agree with centrist liberals because they're too conservative.  I'm kind of like a libertarian who thinks that poverty shouldn't exist and that everyone should have an education / healthcare -- I know those ideas are opposed but I'm pragmatic over idealistic.
All that to say, I have nothing in common with anyone who was destroying things, attacking people, voted for Hillary or cried when Trump won.  I'd rather not be lumped in with those assholes.

Anarchists aren't really allied with anyone - they hate liberals just as much as they do conservatives.  They are usually the one's who incite riots, assault people and damage millions of dollars worth of property.  They come to fuck shit up as a rejection to whatever people are there to complain about.
All that to say, it does matter when you start conflating anarchists with progressives, centrist liberals, feminists, sjws, etc.  I'm not saying that you did this, but a lot of prominent internet conservatives do (e.g. Lauren Southern).

I find that most things are repairable if parts are available.  9/10 it's just a blown cap and people don't know enough to buy a replacement for 20 bucks and solder it in.  When things don't work, ppl tend to sell them for cheap - I'd haggle to $75 shipped.  That said, I do see your point.  I'll look to find some that are broken but get a new one in the meantime.  Getting a new one might take a few months, though :/

That's pretty common though.  When police retaliate against these assholes, they're very heavy handed and end up hurting innocent civilians which leads to law suits.  The precedent for this was set decades ago and has been ongoing since like 1999 during the Seattle Riots.

This is the responsible way to approach things, but I do have a question.  How could Bitcoin possibly fail?  The more people invest, the more motivated they become to ensure that it doesn't fail.

Roger Ver has already eluded to the fact that bitcoin.com gets far more visitors than bitcoin.org.  He has also stated that he won't change the name and will continue to call BTU, Bitcoin.  Will he force BTC to change its name?  AFAIK, Mt.Gox owned the trademark on Bitcoin.  Who owns it now?

Who will host this forum?  Who will manage it?
My point is that this is a massive undertaking that has more to do with creating a social media platform that rivals reddit but has a completely different formula for managing what is posted and how it's prioritized.
Edit: I've been kicking this can around in my head for quite some time.  How do you create a decentralized site like reddit that doesn't need moderation and isn't controlled by mob rule?

@_date: 2017-03-21 23:24:48
Consensus is a broken idea.  The concept of power ensures that communities will never agree - it's part of the human condition.  This is why the core tenant of Anarchism is to question power at every turn and not outright reject it.  Sometimes, power is legitimate when consensus breaks down or is too inefficient for the actions that must be taken.
In the case of bitcoin, this means that there will be constant power struggles (as there has been throughout its history).  It will always be up to us to remain vigilant and focus on the technical specs rather than the sales pitch from the latest politicians.  Ensure that the code has the brightest minds working on it - ensure that Bitcoin remains decentralized - hodl.

Soak up as much info as you can.  The more information you get from more sides of the argument, the more you will come to your own conclusions.

This person said they're long on Bitcoin which means that they're willing to take a loss now for gains in the future. This person would have been better off just spending the money to buy already existing bitcoin. I'm sorry that I seem to be the only person in this threat that brought it up.

An IOU for future labor or goods is still a form of bartering. In a doomsday scenario, a person would be a fool to accept an IOU because the other person has a high chance of being dead before they can pay up.

I don't think you do understand "not your keys, not your coins" because it contradicts everything you just said. Unless you have no fucking clue what you're doing, it is nearly impossible for someone else to steal your bitcoin. You'd have to make some incredibly stupid choices - almost as stupid as handing them to a 3rd party to guard for you.
You pull out a small amount of coins for a daily stipend and you accept the fact that due to the convenience and laxed security, they could be stolen easily just like your cash or credit cards could. The rest nobody should ever even get close to if you take some pretty basic and well explained (ad nauseum in fact) precautions.

Yes to everything you said. The United States or Europe collapsing would be very different than most other countries. We have far too many cities and they all require the importation of all of their resources. If things got bad, the cities would go into lock down and they'd stop people from leaving to contain the situation. Most people in the cities would go to FEMA for rations because they wouldn't know what to do otherwise and even if they did, they'd be hindered by the sheer amount of people in the city who don't.

Except if blockchain was implemented in the way that it was originally intended, it would actually be a true solution to many of the security flaws of online voting. A decentralized voting system could work if the software had all of the necessary security protocols baked in to the software. I'd advise against a centralized website unless it was hosted by a technology similar to ipfs, but even still, cross-platform software would be better, as there would be no single point of failure.

You're just trying to be right instead of having a conversation. After this comment I will waste no more of my time replying. There is no way for an attacker to know if you have or how much crypto you have unless you know them and they've told you - that would be opsec violation 1.
If it's a random attacker, they will take what is on your phone or laptop and move on. Anyone skilled enough wouldn't bother with this and would instead focus on these banks you're imagining.
I'm looking at this as an attacker. Going after an I dividual blindly is too high of a risk with too little a reward. I'd focus on a slow game against the banks. I promise you with enough social engineering and research, someone would knock off a place like that. Those keys have to be stored somewhere and they will likely be in a poor place.
If you're that worried about the coins a multi-sig wallet is better than any 3rd party where you have no way to verify their security practices.
Also, banks are only to insured for up to $100,000 fdic afaik and it's completely irrelevant to security.

This is a poor argument. A free market can't account for a potential consumer base of almost 7 billion people. There's too much noise and confusion. This is why pyramid schemes still thrive today. People have to learn their lesson, and almost all of them learn the hard way. Unfortunately, there's always new unaware customers. So the people never overcome the scam by de-popularizing them.

So by burning this 500M they made ~15M US dollar."* Tether is able to essentially print it's own money with no regulation by using methods like this.
3. **Use case** Who are all of these people using Tether? What businesses and exchanges are using Tether as their backbone to justify the number of transactions that are taking place daily? What is the difference between 
4. **Red herring** People often argue that there's nothing wrong with an unethical act because ultimately people have the ability to not participate. This is a red herring because it leads you on a trail to nowhere - the unethical act is still unethical and is still doing harm.
To put all of that together, Tether is a solution to a problem that simply doesn't exist. Visa already does what Tether claims to do, and it does it with oversight and transparency. Nobody is using Tether for the reasons it claims to exist - it's being day traded. We can neither trust nor verify tether.

Warren Buffet, is that you?
Bitcoin is a delayed gratification, my friend.  I know I'm preaching to the choir, but Bitcoin going from 2k to 4k in a matter of months is the very tippy top of the ice berg.  If the experiment continues to be a success, the reward at the end of the road is well worth the petty risk.
Juggling full-time work and my side business, my plan is to put 50% into necessities, 25% into savings (1/2 fiat, 1/2 bitcoin) and 25% into myself (building up my side business so that it can become my only business.  That percentages will shift as my available income shifts (more into savings and myself).  I'm no fool - you just assumed I was.

For instance, Roger doesn't represent Bitcoin anymore than anyone else but he owns bitcoin.com and speaks as if he does.  Undoubtedly, the reason bcash supporters maintain that the name should be stated as "Bitcoin Cash" is to confuse newcomers and ride the back of bitcoin's success -- very scammy.

You would allow that piece of information to be public by design.


Triple factor authentication and better record keeping across all departments of government. Retinal and print scans along with a unique cryptographic key that only the citizen is aware of. This way if the retinal and print servers hare compromised, the data is still relatively useless to attackers.
Admittedly, his wouldn't solve all cases of fraud but it would reduce it to a fraction of the amount of voter fraud that exists today.


If investigators had reason to believe that a fraudulent ballot was cast, they could always contact that voter and request that they verify their vote.

I'm working on starting my own business.  I have no interest in giving my labor to help build someone else's empire for the rest of my life.
This isn't a distraction - it's part of my plan.  I've been watching bitcoin for five years and I'm well aware of the concept of hodling.  I had to spend the money for a medical emergency and something that extreme isn't likely to happen again.
I'm not concerned about the high price or rally per se.  I just want to integrate bitcoin into my business model and hodl it all for retirement.  This way I'm not investing cash but just labor.

It seems that both use a 4 digit pin which can be brute forced quite quickly unless there's something built in at the firmware level that disallows access on a clock after the wrong pin is entered so many times.  Even still, if someone steals your hardware wallet, they'll be able to get past this over time (unless I'm unaware of some added layer of security).
Seems like it would be better if pin verification came from the hardware instead of the app, since keylogging can take place the way it currently exists, but perhaps I'm missing something.
I think I'll start with a Trezor since it's more established.  Thanks again for the advice.

I think it's going to be the only way to legitimately identify a voter, only with a cryptographic key that is issued to you via software and isn't shared with anyone else - not even the government.

Bigger blocks are bad because it will cause centralization of the nodes and won't solve the problem.  It will cause centralization because it will increase the bandwidth, storage and processing power needed to validate blocks.  In time, after repeated block increases, only the very wealthy will be able to run nodes.  It won't solve the problem because special interests will continue to spam the blockchain but harder in order to raise fees once again.
All that said, LN being a worse situation is debatable at best and simply not true at worst.
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:14:13
If your goal is anonymity, this approach could be tracked unless you're careful.  A researcher would be able to see that X amount was transferred to an address that at some point was owned by shapeshift.  Then they would look for identical amounts purchased in altcoin.  Then they would look for transfers back to BTC wallets for the same amount in the same time periods - they could always subpeona shapeshift - guarantee they keep detailed records.

There's a lot that can go wrong with Bitcoin - I'm confident that a major exploit will eventually devastate it.  My confidence doesn't lie in the the current code, but the excellent developers and community that are heavily invested in making sure that the experiment is a success.
There's no other cryptocurrency that can overtake bitcoin at the moment.  If another one arises, I will re-evaluate.
My future lies in my business, which will eventually make me more than bitcoin ever could.  For me, earning and hodling bitcoin isn't just part of a future estate, but it's my opportunity to contribute to something that might change the world.  I want to be able to say that I participated and held against all odds when I'm an old fuck shitting my pants while I sit on the porch.
Shit happens - there's nothing I can do about that.  I just burned through 6 months of savings - I'll recover, but I want to recover dat sweet, sweet bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:07:21


Why does it seem far fetched?  It's a big enough of a concern for the core devs (who know far more about bitcoin than you or I) to want to avoid it.


Just because they've been increase doesn't mean they'll continue to increase.


Controlling economies means power. Bitcoin will always be under threat due to this fact.


This may be possible in the future, but these improvement don't exist today - there's no way to guarantee this.


It doesn't really - if the community feels like LN isn't working, consensus will get rid of it.


Yes, and like with all other great technologies, new layers will be built to answer changes in tech and demand.  SW &amp; LN are just the first of many layers to come.


Technology changes - don't weep for the ludites.


Interesting then that you have yet to give any solid technical reasoning for this.  Just flawed opinions and now a massive wall of text I have to sift through.


Do you seriously believe that this won't be handled by a front-end that makes it all automated and easy?


Please explain in detail what you mean by this statement.


is it? Citation needed.


If you think that bitcoin transactions are anonymous then you're wrong.


If I remember correctly, the whitepaper specifically mentioned the need for added off-chain layers in the future.  If I'm correct, seems like it's part of the "core" ideology.


You have yet to explain why there would be an increase in transaction fees, yet you continue to assert that LN will cause this.  As far as I can tell, increased fees have been caused by special interests spaming the blockchain.


I've argued to the best that I have time to devote.

You don't have to register a trademark to have rights to a trademark or to even defend it.  I'm not sure how it's against the whole idea.  Bitcoin is decentralized and FOSS and that is what's important.  If I make a shitcoin tomorrow and call it Bit-Coin, create initial offerings at 3/4 of the current price of bitcoin and basically scam people into thinking their buying into bitcoin, then that is a problem.  As long as I never say it's bitcoin, then I've committed no crime and can't be liable -- especially if I sell them anonymously.

More specifically, anytime blockchain is used for any reason other than decentralization, it's just a sub-par database. Some may argue that blockchain also provides immutability but that doesn't have to be true and you'll be hard pressed to find a company that would truly want that feature anyway.

It appears that you're arguing based on personal feelings and ideology.  I'm arguing out of pragmatism and logic.


Satoshi doesn't own bitcoin -- he gave it to the world and now we own it collectively. Satoshi made short sighted mistakes - not registering the domain was one of them. Satoshi didn't have to register the trademark for it to actually exist.


Again - are you sure about that?  Are you a lawyer?


I would argue that the only way it's helping is by forcing bitcoin to become more resilient against new attacks.  It's a shitcoin that has no legitimate purpose other than to weaken bitcoin.  If there's a fight, then it's BCH who's perpetuation the attack.

Except I've caught Roger saying that he would declare S2x to be BTC on bitcoin.com. If he hasn't outright done it yet, he has flirted with the idea. Furthermore, he is conflating bcash with bitcoin constantly with and bitcoin.com and I guarantee it's confused newcomers.
There will come a time when Roger slips and when he does, is gonna get no scoped. I predict Roger getting slammed with litigation until he's bankrupt in the next 5 years for shenanigans that he hasn't even pulled yet.

Direct democracy isn't mob rule if you structure it wisely from the beginning. You take the best of what we have and build that as a core, where the software would enforce those basic standards. From there, the people can build a governance that will be free from centralization. There is a lot of political theory that would have to be gone through in building such a system and it would take experts from all over the globe to build it well, but it could be done and it's possible now.
To your point on coercion, the risk is equally possible regardless of location. That said, there's nothing dictating that this software couldn't be used in central locations if that's what people choose. In fact, it's probably a good idea to give people the option for those who may not have access to the web. I'd imagine that in a self-governing system with a wise electorate, anyone caught trying to scam or coerce the system would be guilty of one of the highest crimes in that society. In a free world, it's likely that those people would be flushed out quickly.

I know this, but the act of making a font char for BTC means it can't look good. It's limited to 1 color and has to fit the char dimensions, which means the proper logo will always be smaller than the surrounding text.

You're wrong - here's why.
Let's switch arbitrarium to copper. Copper is necessary for our way of life to continue. Modern technology simply can't exist without it. Let's say our supply of relatively easily accessible copper has depleted and now the cost is consistently rising as the cost of mining copper has become more difficult.  Now understand that this is reality.
In a similar way, cryptocurrency is increasing in popularity and everyone who has invested has a vested interest to make sure it succeeds. As such, to keep mining going, the miners much recoup the cost - just like copper. As such, the market will continue to pump the price accordingly. Those investing will willfully pay more to keep their existing investments secure and those with fomo will buy buy buy high high high and sell low as always.

Before you call me a shill, take note that I don't support Maduro (this shouldn't matter), but I do recognize the constant pressures by the Venezuelan right and the US State Dept to extinguish socialism in the country -- the pair have done some pretty shady shit in the past and this a continuation of that.

The point is that there isn't a perfect solution - that would be impossible.  Even if you did everything else right, encryption technologies have a lifespan.  This is my point.

Here are my thoughts on 2x, big blocks, Segregated Witness and Lightning Network in 3 points:
1. 2x is a short term and short sighted solution to a problem that doesn't currently exist. That is to say, full blocks aren't an urgent issue. Special interests have a long history of spamming the blockchain in order to manufacture unnecessary urgency.
2. Bigger blocks will increase the data storage and processing power required in order to validate transactions. If the community chooses to use block increases as the solution to full blocks, the cost of hardware required to validate transactions will exponentially increase - this will guarantee the centralization of bitcoin.
3. SegWit and Lightning Network are added layers to Bitcoin - much like there are layers of software in TCP/IP or Linux. As Bitcoin progresses, it will require more off chain solutions and Satoshi recognizes this in his white paper (though he hadn't thought through the big block issue before he abandoned the project).
4. High transaction fees are a problem when blocks are full. Before this becomes an actual problem, we'll have the Lightning Network to solve the problem.
5. More so than anything else mentioned is the fact that 2x is deliberately incompatible with Bitcoin Core, where the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin coders contribute and where all of the best developers code. That little tid-bit is a power play and a serious threat to the Bitcoin community.

Yes, I've read the white paper.  Yes, it defines what Bitcoin is -- not on the spec level but as a concept and it's enough to define it in court AFAIK.
By spec, do you mean [the license](  Violation of the license would be copyright infringement.  The only way to violate the license that Bitcoin falls under would be to fork it or share it without the same license applied.
Again - when you claim a product is a different product and make gains when the product is sold under those pretenses - that is fraud.  This applies to all products sold or traded in the United States.

You do realize that you can hold anarchist or libertarian ideals and still see necessity for some laws, right?  There is an imbalance of power if someone is allowed to scam you and get away with it simply because you trusted what they were claiming. This will not correct itself because more and more people will exploit this as they see there is no recourse.  A truly free market is a myth - we have laws for a reason and the nuance within the system we've built is important.  Some laws are just and some aren't but it's unwise to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

This truth should not have priority over decentralization - that's short sighted.  High transaction fees delay adoption of Bitcoin. Centralization of Bitcoin kills Bitcoin.


True, but the roadway to hell is paved with good intentions. Those who are able to will ensure the functionality of the network. They will also inherently hold an imbalance of power within the network. Furthermore, it will offer a massive exploit to global banks and nation states who may look to do harm to the network.

Trademark is protected by use of a product. Those who participate in the Bitcoin community by mining, running nodes and hodling are using Bitcoin as a product. Therefore, we have a right to stop roger from doing this if we choose to (again, an actual lawyer is needed to verify or bust this).
I'm in bitcoin because based on the white paper, it solves many existing societal problems that are otherwise going unchallenged. Just because I disagree with big government doesn't mean I can't use said government to solve problems - to think otherwise is you allowing your ideology to cloud your mind from thinking logically.

trademark *(noun)*
    
1. a symbol, word, or words legally registered or **established by use** as representing a company or **product**.
I argue that the overwhelming consensus of the Bitcoin community own a collective trademark on Bitcoin.  As such, we must defend it when it's challenged. We must defend it against Roger Ver, who is trying to promote B2X as BTC. A Cease and Desist is in order at the very least, IMHO.

I've made it clear that I identify and an anarchist. That said, I don't do well around most anarchist circles because in my experience they aren't usually anarchists, they're radical authoritarian liberals who don't know how to think critically or self-analyze.

This isn't true by default, though circumstances could be as such.  Not sure they are in this case.


Debatable.  Bitcoin Jesus is said to be a Bitcoin Billionaire.  If Garzik is actually Satoshi as he claims, then he's probably the most wealthy person on the planet. /jk




People tend to hold objectivism to religious levels, where they aren't willing to bend their ideals to be pragmatic -- this is also true for Anarchism by the way, but I tend to lean towards left libertarianism over right libertarianism.

It's definitely going to crash, but when is anyone's guess.  I think it's going to continue to go up for at least another month.  There isn't anything happening right now to devalue BTC, so when the bubble bursts, I can't imagine that it will drop below ~$1,500.
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:17:56
That wasn't a bubble popping - we're riding the precipice of a burst now.  If the numbers go too far outside of the pink projection lines on [this chart]( it will indicate a bubble and you should be prepared to buy at a low, but if it stays within those lines, the price of bitcoin will double before 2018.

Nodes are how we decide how bitcoin works - it's our way of voting on what code will be run.  If only giant companies and  nation states can afford to run nodes, then bitcoin is a failed expirament.  It isn't just about the amount of data but also the processing power to verify it.  Right now you can run a full node on a $30 Raspberry Pi and a 1 TB USB drive -- it's at about 150 GB at this point.
What I just said isn't paranoia - it's fact.
The community as a whole isn't toxic but there are a lot of bad actors out there spreading misinformation and FUD.  I tend to listen to experts who are doing the actual coding - I hope others will to.
There's no guarantee that LN will be ready but it's likely.  What is certain is that btc will be worthless if 8MB blocks are put in place and that fork wins out over the other.

Special interests will spam to fill up the blocks again (as they've been doing for quite some time now).  Miners want to make money.
Yes - a side effect of a block size increase is an immediate but short term decrease in transaction fees.  The consequences outweigh that short sighted reward.

@_date: 2017-07-10 22:30:34
From an economics point of view it would be temporary.  A 2MB block will eventually fill up and when that happens the transaction fees will rise higher than they are now.
Again - increasing block size  will eventually (sooner rather than later) result in irreparable damage to the decentralization of bitcoin.
SW &amp; LN are not enough in the distant future, but they'll do better than small block size increases will in the short term.  New layers will be created that will eventually sort all of this out, but SW &amp; LN are what we have right now.

This was an assumption made by that in the long run is incorrect.
My argument is that block size increase only solves a small problem temporarily and causes several long term issues.  Block increases are something that we can't simply continue to dip into unless we want to threaten decentralization.  Satoshi said we'd need additional layers to solve this problem.  SegWit and Lightning Network are the first to begin addressing this.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:23:44


Foot in mouth - seems I have some reading to do of my own.  I had this bookmarked and admittedly didn't read it again before linking it to you.  I thought that block validation would become less intensive for nodes because of data reduction.

You have a warped sense of how bitcoin works -- looking through the lens of a business man with no technical savvy.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:28:06
It's a 8MB block size increase being sold as a 2MB increase - this will kill Bitcoin by making it critically vulnerable to centralization.  It will result in only very wealthy and powerful players have a say in how bitcoin is run.  Gone will be the days of running a node from a pi, desktop or home server.
This will also give veto power to the top miners, which means further centralization.
The vast majority of regular users that you seem to be speaking for need to better educate themselves before they vote for something they'll regret.
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:05:10
Care to explain this?

If you increase block size, it will always fill up over time.  When they fill up, the price will rise again and miners will charge more because more people will have adopted bitcoin (supply and demand).
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:23:37
No - it's correct.
A. Increasing block size won't lower transaction fees in the long term - you're being duped.
B. Increasing block size will increase the resources necessary to verify and store blocks, thus limiting the pool of people willing and able to participate in the economic consensus of nodes.
This isn't up for debate - it's just a matter of fact.

1. What is your point?  That doesn't mean that their special interest won't lead to them trying to control bitcoin.
2. True.
3. Explain this because as it stands it means nothing - just jargon.
4.  No power is given to another party.  It will not destroy the value of the coin.  The white paper clearly states that side chains will have to be used.  It doesn't turn anything into virtual fiat.  Please explain your claim and cite it, otherwise I'm calling you out as a liar.

Bitcoin specifically, but IMHO none of the other existing coins have figured it out - most scams and the few that aren't are severely flawed on one way or another (including the popular Dash and Ethereum).

Larger blocks will eventually result in much higher fees -- something non-techies don't understand.

Centralization vs decentralization is more of a scale -- it isn't either/or.  
Do you want more centralization or less?  If you want less, then it's best to ensure that the maximum number of people can afford to run a node.
For instance, I run a full node on spare parts that I had lying around not being used (pi 3, sd card &amp; 1 tb usb drive).  If someone wanted to do this, they could build the same system for about 100 USD.
Everything that exists is only as good as its weakest link.  In this case, in order to promote a high degree of decentralization, we will not accept a block increase and we will force SegWit.

It held at 6k for so long because people were holding out in an attempt to recoup costs for investing too high. After a year, those people are starting to cut their losses which is why it's dropping. When it drops into the 2k range, I'd say it's safe to buy again but you might still lose money to an even lower drop - just stomach it.
Keep track of the news cycles because there will inevitably be some whale who creates big news again, creating more fomo, making it happen all over again.
Sell once you've made a decent amount and keep in mind that you'll feel like you missed out yourself for not waiting longer as it keeps going up but you'll feel better when it tanks again. Then you can buy more Bitcoin with the money you earned after the correction is done the next time.  Investing in Bitcoin is a long game that you likely won't survive - this technology will take a long time to flush out and the world will be very different when people are ready to adopt it.

Wrong - I am forever skeptical and I see something that is uncharacteristic of this subreddit.  SW2X is a terrible solution and will result in higher transaction fees - mark my words.  You people are playing into miners hands.   
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:53:56
Nobody is -- this entire thread is an astroturf.

@_date: 2017-06-24 12:32:26
Please provide evidence of your claims.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:20:13
Misspelling America to be edgy is tantamount to using the word sheeple. Please don't. This has been a PSA. The more you know.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:31:40


It isn't - it's giving the miners what they want, which will result in even higher fees.
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:46:14
The cost of bandwidth, memory and storage have decreased, soooooooo...
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:20:47
because increasing block size will eventually lead to the necessity of needing even higher transaction fees.  Segwit and LN are the solution we need.

There are many people who want to see harm done to btc and they will take such information and use it against btc, even if there's nothing damaging in the documentation.  They will simply create lies about it even though it's easily disprovable because -- again -- you aren't trying to convince me, you're trying to convince the uneducated.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:20:59
I've been down this road with folks before -- more times than I care to count.  What is spewing is the common mo.  They make wild claims with no proof and then claim that mods should release evidence to exonerate themselves.  In reality, they would just use such information to further their web of lies.
The reason the mods shouldn't cooperate with these fucks is the same reason your lawyer will tell you to never talk to the police -- no matter what you say, it will be used against you.
It's best to just let them know that they bullshit isn't welcomed here and that they should either provide evidence for their claims or stfu.  They will inevitably post one of the same three medium articles as "proof" and you will go through circular logic forever because they aren't trying to convince you, they're trying to convince the uneducated and it's all funded by Bitcoin Jesus, Jihan Wu and shitcoiners who want to see bitcoin fail.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:29:42
or maybe never.
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:29:27
AFAIK, SegWit2x is a block increase hard fork disguised as a compromise to allow SegWit.  Ultimately, it will allow miners to charge much higher fees in the future when the 2MB block size is full -- it's unsustainable in many way.  People need to start listening to the experts on this instead of Bitcoin Jesus and Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:45:39
If 5 new shitcoins arrive each day, assuming each shitcoin scams a sufficient number of people to take at least .5% of the market share, how many days will it take before bitcoin's market share stabilizes? /s
That is to say, correlation doesn't prove causation.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:41:36
New-comers don't give a shit about decentralization - they don't even know what it means. They care about being told crypto is censorship resistant and immediately seeing examples of how it's able to be censored.
These are the types of people who need to be told about services like bisq and then guided through how to set them up and use them.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:24:47
It hasn't hit the bottom though. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:29:46
Ya'll laugh, but it only takes once. Such a bill could get voted down hundreds of times before people aren't paying enough attention and it gets shoehorned into something else.
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:35:29
Do you suffering from the delusion that most people will be able to look at your links and derive any meaningful information?
Please explain the FUD and falsities against SegWit2x -- enlighten us with descriptive and cited information.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:48:37
It's sad that you've owned bitcoin since 2012 but haven't even done enough research to know what a node is or how crucial it is in the process.
You can be fed up with stagnation all you want but the point is far from trivial.  What incentive would the Core developers have to keep the stagnation?  What incentive does Bitmain have to keep the stagnation?
When you answer those questions, you'll know who you should trust.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:27:46
It would be nice if you could provide some specific examples of your claims.  I hate shit coin pumpers, but I'm also skeptical enough to not take your word for it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:06:49
Came here to say this.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:32:32
Wasn't aware that it did - I'd probably read the negative reviews to find out.  I can only vouch for the Windows and Linux versions, as I would never put a wallet on my phone.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:17:17
Funny joke, but there is no technical necessity to do this.  There are technical reasons to avoid block size increases.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:51:43
Prove it.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:56:15
You are going to Egypt
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:44:36
Shut your shill mouth, scumbag.  So tired of reading your bullshit up and down this thread.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:38:44
Yes but if you don't do enough business to necessitate LN, then just use main chain? Most people will not do enough business to make running a node worth it. This is something that should be considered and adjusted later when it's no longer a problem because adoption has reached a tipping point (decades and decades from now).
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:40:46
People are good at that.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:27:47
Milo distorts things - fact. I think Milo is a master troll and despite the fact that I most often loath his message, I love him for it. It doesn't matter, though. The point is that he presented a real challenge to us as a community (one that we already knew existed), but has brought it to the forefront. We can shrug it off and deal with the consequences, or we can start providing bounties for making core prettier and more user friendly. We should also take Luke's advice and make blocksize improvements so that it's easier and less costly for the average joe to run a full node, full-time.
I for one am not even sure where to bring this up. Do the devs mostly discuss on IRC, bitcointalk - I dunno? I think I should certainly be following my own words and looking into it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:46:36
My node is signaling BIP148 -- bitcoin needs to harden its shell against the kind of shit that Jihan and friends have pulled.
I found your comments otherwise entertaining and generally correct.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:02:10
Is it a bad thing, though?
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:57:13
Not in Venezuela.

@_date: 2017-06-24 12:48:07
So says the paid shill account - pathetic indeed.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:43:27
Well...   15 feet or so, but yes.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:55:00
How about you back up your claims with evidence and citations?  The burden of proof is upon you.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:17:51
Ishmael has returned to spread the good word!






@_date: 2017-06-24 12:35:14
You have yet to post one single fact backed by a citation.  Please do so or GTFO.
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:21:31
Then you need to understand what a block increase actually means.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:47:08
Probobly, but that doesn't change the perception for people new to bitcoin. This should be a point of concern for us in the cryptospace. We need to push alternatives like bisq and help create documentation that will make it simple for grandma to use.
