Nah, bitcoin was created by the CIA.

Thanks. That’s inspiring.

Thanks haha. Are you just mining bitcoin or anything else? Which model of Antminer is that?
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:51:45
Can I ask how did you begin? Did you start with one miner then bought a few more with profits?

Sell and start a short position!

You probably shouldn't unless you have a decent income. I used my line of credit to buy Canadian marijuana stocks, and then they went down 40-50% - while waiting 8 months now. So I've been stuck paying down the principal and interest since then. I trust by next year they'll go back up due to legalization, but I am not stretching myself to buy bitcoins that fast with an LOC, my plan is to accumulate smaller amounts when I get paid.

Hope it doesn't tank on you - only buy what you can afford to lose.

When’s the soft spoon coming?

It is a rock that’s owned by one person, and turned it into his own country.

QuadrigaCX is a Canadian exchange, that or Kraken allows you to sell BTC/ETH/LTC for CAD$.

Depends on your level of comfort. I am comfortable storing &gt;$1k in BTC on a paper wallet and have had no issues. I did recently order a hardware wallet just for the sake of having one. For long-term storage, paper wallets are good as long as you do it correctly (clean computer, offline printer, or take a photo of the keys with an offline digital camera).

Why not do both?

Legal tender works because it's backed by the government which has guns?... so they're going to gun down people for choosing alternative currency around banks?
