He's quoted as saying he's not interested in bitcoin along with his statement of regret

Lol he's not interested in it.
He probably means the harassment he got for his comment.

Not everyone bought at that year low though ugh...stupid shit post. You can literally make this argument with anything and it means nothing.

This is stupid.
One, Not everybody got in early.
Two, you can only go down 100%. Comparing 16% down vs 11872% isn't fair. A 16% drop from a 11872% gain is FUCKING MASSIVE.

2) How do you know when it hits the ground?

Think. For sure. Huh.

I wasn't sure if you were being serious with your initial post and, if you were, I wanted to know why you thought that way. Not for financial advise. Just wondering where you got it from

What a shit way to promote Bitcoin. Why couldn't she have used Venmo or PayPal or any services from banks like Zelle
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:23:17
I'm not even really jerking off over PayPal here. It's just that in this situation described above, PayPal is a fine alternative to a wire.
