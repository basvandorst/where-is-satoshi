He is also in favor of supporting competing currencies

because the transactions are going to be used to store metadata for the transactions of the file storage and the bitcoin blockchain did not allow enough data to be stored.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:10:18
That would be your configuration however I don't think there would be any benefit to have anything but raid 0
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:41:56
The coins are generated using counterparty protocol.  When a user buys space on the network to upload a file the people that store the file get the payment from that transaction.

People will pay for the storage they are "leasing" in SJCX.  The Token of storj.  So you will get paid in SJCX.  The crowdsale that is going on right now is sending out SJCX + early access to drive Miner + early access to metadisk for participating...
My analysis shows that based on the current rate of 38,500 SJCX/Bitcoin in the crowdsale gives 1 SJCX an approximate value of $0.01608987
or 2597 Satoshi

you would think the organizers of this would have tried to not have it the same weekend as inside bitcoin in las vegas

Not sure hopefully when lands in Chicago he may be able to add to it
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:01:48
The papers describing how it will work
@_date: 2014-07-21 22:40:41
I think based on current pricing the project has a great potential to allow people to make money....Even if the price of SJCX remains constant
These do make some assumption of max utilization of your storage.  But with my 4TB hard drive laying on a shelf collecting dust at a 100X discount to DropBox pricing it could bring in about $400/year for me...so in ~3 months buy another and add to the array.  then buy another in ~1.5 months and be able to start taking in around $100 per month.
This analysis does not discuss the algorithms behind storj or the encryption so if thats what your looking for here thats not what I intend to discuss

the default is set for 3 redundancy is what has been said...the network will issue a challenge in the form of a hash to verify the files are there and in tact and not modified...if something is missing changed corrupt on one node the two others will send a copy of the missing piece to another node
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:47:54
Nice use of Metadisk 
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:51:31
Im not a programmer Im an engineer i can understand most of what is being said in there but how to solve it i get a little lost but from everything i have read they are doing work actually which is better than a lot of other places i have seen trying to solve the same problems

Emancipate yourself 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:09:48
the terms of the sale shouldnt be broadcast everywhere...if you sent money without reading the terms you really only have yourself to blame
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:00:56
Looking at the expense sheet that was posted on their forums...they rally don't have a lot to pay for other than a couple employees full time.  The rest of the team looks like volunteers getting paid in sjcx
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:09:06
It was stated in almost every thread and topic that the question was brought up, and implied in the terms
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:26:28
 This is the official TB pledge thread on the forums if that helps
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:24:31
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:58:15
I'm not sure what you mean.  From my understanding that would be factored into the cost when you pay to upload.  A 1 gig file will use 3 gigs of space on the network
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:22:07
The blockchain itself is way more important than the coin

People have built demos including a video player using storj'a metadisk
Storj is not just a cloud but a platform 
Available Node: 
Documentation: 
Current Demos:
Decentralized Video - 
Decentralized Images -  
Decentralized Audio - 
PDF / Txt Demo -

But we are not solving blocks we are not generating more coins...files are randomly and geographically distributed to people hosting..now if we are talking about something like burst...,where the more space you had the more hash power you have that different...that's proof of capacity....more you have the more you get...with this the more you store the more you get paid but everyone will earn with With same probability 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:32:05
Decentralized cloud storage.  People will be able to "farm" with their hard drives by renting them out to build a large decentralized cloud storage system. Using api's people can build applications on top of the network.
Here is a link to the one minute intro video
Current demos built by people include a video player. Music streaming image sharing etc 
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:11:26
I do t think you understand how it's intended to work...the guy with 500 PB of storage has just as much chance TOL host the same file as the guy with 10 GB granted the guy with 500 PB can hold more and make more money in the long term it doesn't give him a greater chance of hosting like having more hash power increase your chances of finding a block 
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:54:00
 Here is the link to the for where it is discussed to test the released portion so far
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:44:27
but highly unlikely that they would be turned off at the exact same moment...when one goes down the network would heal and send a copy to another node
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:44:29
Of course...is there any other way to share files anymore ;)
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:24:17
I think the point regarding discussing projects is important introducing them to information about btc 2.0 projects would b good.  If you want som info about storj shoot an email over to hello
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:21:15
The project was built to utilize existing systems with sunk costs or systems that will be built anyway.  To speculate and build large servers for this today would be kind of silly.  Think about it in early Bitcoin at one time a CPU made sense the gpu then asic.  It will take time to evolve no sense in rushing to the finish line
Years in advance.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:36:06
The blockchain can't handle file sizes needed is my understanding
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:17:14
I would have to disagree as without a vagina you cannot be sure she is a woman
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:38:15
i think its ok for people to be scared...more sjcx for me to gobble up quick ;)
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:56:19
The Driveshare app is still in development and will be made available to the crowdsale participants to beta test
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:02:04
With storj however having more space available does not mean you make more money
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:01:11
It may not have been explicitly stated but implied in the operation of challenges...
Overall i think the project is good with some work to do and So far the best positioned to solve the issues that have been brought up so far
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:42:12
From the FAQ they posted:
Bitcoin cannot be easily modified. That would be like trying to do an engine upgrade on an airplane currently in flight. With our own coin, we have more flexibility to tinker, modify, and adapt to the purposes of the project. One of the limiting factors of Bitcoin is the metadata size limit of ~80 bytes. This is incompatible with our current system, and which would limit the functionality of Storj. If/when sidechains/treechains are implemented, Storj would love to reintegrate with Bitcoin..
From what I understand you can use any wallet that you hold the private key.  The tokens were created using counterparty so counter wallet made things easier.

Well people will be incentivized to stay active on the network.  As far as enough people there were about 1500 individual donations to their crowdsale.  Those will be the first people on the network.
As far as Fortune 500 companies go there could be many use cases 
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:58:09
They were generated to be dispersed during the crowdsale, for the devs and the community
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:04:50
I hear your concerns however with the way it is set up the authorities would have to go after the person that uploaded and published the content not the servers it is being stored.
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:54:19
Yea 500,000,000 is the hard cap
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:52:36
With all due respect my answers are viable alternatives just because you don't like them is not my problem
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:33:51
The founder has said that they could hardfork back to btc if sidechains or treechains become a thing
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:40:48
Actually if you read the full deck only 350,000,000 coins will be issued during the crowdsale, for a total of 10,000 btc,  75,000,000 reserved for the community, and 75,000,000 for the developers 
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:42:15
I was just thinking about your edit as I read this and I think that you get some compensation for passing challenges if I remember what I saw I. The chat log

Hi there skynet!
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:36:28
I think people need to realize that buying SJCX is not purchasing "stock" in the company.  It is purchasing the tokens that are to be used on the network to purchase space..this is a very big difference...Looking at it as a security is the wrong way to view this.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:08:20
most of that was in the crowdsale terms...if you dont read the terms...it kind of becomes your fault for not knowing
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:01:26
The way it will work though is you cannot access or view the files that are stored so it would be very challenging for them to identify you are holding the content 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:10:49
it wouldnt offer any benefit to have the redundancy on your network...the files will be sent to other people as well to maintain redundancy...you get paid for the amount that you store...so having redundancy on your hdd would cause you to make less money
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:25:52
Storj won't be storing the data itself on the blockchain but rather the metadata of the files to act as a pointer to the file locations.  
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:58:48
the double negatives make it hard to tell if your being sarcastic
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:05:40
Looking at the info for the fdcard it was fractional during the folding distributions.   So there are only about 170 of them actually in tact making it the rarest of all the assets so far
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:31:36
actually with t0 the trade is the settlement..there is no difference
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:44:38
I dont know...i dont think ethereum is there yet for what they want...im gonna guess something that has a well controlled ecosystem like ripple
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:30:10
He said they have chosen a primary ledger however can work with any ledger with some additional weeks of coding....
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:54:58
that is a basic summation of what i got out of the high level discussion
