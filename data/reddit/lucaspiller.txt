It's ok, it'll take some time to get that Lambo polished properly.

Same here. I got an email saying it had been processed, but nothing has showed up, so I assume they are dead. Oh well, only lost $1000.

I've just checked, and yes they've also initiated a transaction. The speed is dependant on the fee per byte, not transaction amount, which for me is 44 satoshis per byte.
At this rate it's going to be... a while (mine has been unconfirmed for 3 days). If we are lucky the number of transactions will go down over the holidays and it'll be picked up.

The wait for confirmation would be a bit boring...
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:31:00
Shows what I know :-) So maybe it's better if confirmation takes longer...

What advantage do these provide over storing my wallet only on a USB drive or even just printing out a paper wallet, and putting that in a safe deposit box?
(Serious question, I haven't been keeping up with Bitcoin too much)

When I went there last year they wouldn't accept my Starbucks card that I've used all over Europe, so I'd guess not.

Yes. If it installed a root kit it could still be there, even after uninstalling the app.

Satoshi could always start his own mixing service... Leave it running a couple of months. Make the transaction from the genesis block. Leave it for a few more months then shut it down. You could mask it even more with multiple mixing services.
Also as the grand parent said I wouldn't be surprised if Satoshi isn't involved in any of the big BTC services...

Agreed. With Bitcoin you cannot do chargebacks, so bar the price dropping substantially there are no real negatives for the seller.
Nice place btw :)

Actually, in the UK, banks can do exactly this. Further details:

The other day I was thinking about the security of online wallets - even so called "offline" wallets that require you to enter a passphrase to decrypt your wallet locally on your machine. There is still a dependency on a third party service, even though your wallet may be secure, they could still be DDOSed or just shutdown.

Re SMS we use  as a carrier for two way communication with our web app. They've got the cheapest rates I've seen, and have a ridiculously easy to use API. PM me if you want to know more about the ins and outs of SMS as I've been doing it for years :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:35:17
There's a website for that?

Context for those unfamiliar with the story:

Thanks I'd never heard of localbitcoins.com before. I decided to give them a go, and it seems pretty nice :)

I'm kind of out of the loop on the mobile stuff in Africa, but I've been hearing a lot about it. Nice job! What is the average price/MB for data?

[OT] I'm working for a company right now trying to setup a new merchant account. Most of the big providers say no because they see our business model as being "high risk" because of chargebacks. It got me thinking, how exactly did we get to this situation where it is *so* easy to do a charge back?
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:53:49
Actually that's the thing. Most (stock market) trading platforms (easily available to consumers) charge a fixed fee of something like $20 per trade. Doing that would make it totally unprofitable to do micro trades like this. Even $1 per trade would be work.

Looks great, thanks!
