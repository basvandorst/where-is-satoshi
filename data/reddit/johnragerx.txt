I had a ledger nano X but switch to the coolwallet S after seeing some reviews on the web, my nano X works properly and faced no problem so far, but still I would say coolwallet S is more convenient to use. I like the coolwallet S design more, both the wallet and the app looks neat and user friendly, also bought one for my dad and even him have no issues using it.
  
Coolwallet S is easier to carry (in my wallet) and to use Bitcoin to buy stuff. It's battery also lasted way longer than I thought, charged it more than a month ago but still above 75% right now.
  
Ledger nano X do holds more kinds of coins which people holding more shitcoins may prefer, but I would recommend coolwallet S to anyone who is starting their journey with Bitcoin.
