Well...no. that's because even if you tried to create an adjusted graph it wouldn't make sense unless you put in A LOT of variables. Population, technology, etc.
That increase in money supply is definitely from things like bailouts and QE. I'd be interested in seeing graphs for other countries

By saying that, that basically you don't want the federal government to control any sort of treasury. That would make it difficult for organizations like the federal reserve to look out for unemployment and inflation.
Global markets depend on the dollar as well. Some of your statements I've seen in this threat makes it seem like you're not very well versed in economics. Some of your stances will be able to get many people to believe in you, but, in my opinion, I think that many of your stances are way too far to the left and micro level.
However, good luck in your campaign!

Surprisingly the gold standard played a HUGE role in global economics. I would check out the book "Lords of Finance" which covers, in detail, the gold standard's implication on the global level and takes into account historical events and how that impacted the economy as well.

That's fair enough. I guess it just comes down to fundamental differences in what people think when it comes to what should be driving the economy. 
If you don't support corporatism, what do you support then? I'm gathering that you're saying that you don't want the government interfering in the economy (bail outs, etc), but if they don't then you get even more unfair treatment by the rich (think wall street, TWC/Comcast merger).

Right...from a GS perspective though, they're not sure if its a viable investment. 
Bitcoin is all about being a payment network, not primarily for investments (just like every currency at heart). People just want to make money and technically you can, but I can't blame GS for their takes on this. Interesting though

No definitely not! I didn't know if you were making that remark as if it were an abstract thing (a lot of people don't know that the gold standard was a thing)..
And I completely agree with your remarks. I didn't mean to post that as a political thing. It is amazing historically and that's really the only reason I posted it. This book isn't really about teaching a lesson, more about just the history of economic policy

As a whole yes. But keep in mind that each fed district has its own policies as well

But in that case it's not really the fed doing it, it would be the SEC or the FTC. Completely different than the article though
