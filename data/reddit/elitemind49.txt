I was so close to buying 3 last September before it skyrocketed to 20k. I still get aggro everyday thinking on it!

That's a knee slapper ��

That's insaaaaaane!

Talk about a Thermal paper waking nightmare!  That's a sad story my friend! And interesting.. I'm about to buy one I think just so I can feel good about it if it takes off again. Can you imagine if it hits like 50k within a few months?!

If you don't mind me asking. How many BC do you own?  And when did you first invest?

Much appreciated!!

About the key Tho.  Is it just a password to access the digital wallet? Like could I write it on a page of a book no-one knew of but me and be safe?

I have 1500$ to spend. Wish I would have bought 3 last September when I had the cash.  I got scared. Then it hit 20k! Is it worth investing right now! ?  What site is the safest to purchase from? How long before it takes off again?!

This was the funniest meme I've seen in awhile because it strikes home so hard.  �� I'm sorry about your 3..that's a real bummer.

��  10- 4..I appreciate you sharing what you know.  And the speedy responses.

Thanks for all the food for thought!  Much appreciated..

Is a private key just a password to access your wallet? How reliable is your information? I'm trying to find a BC genius!
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:35:56
The best meme I've ever seen.  This needs to catch some wind in its sails!

What's the best wallet?  How do you keep from being hacked?  Is it possible it will crash completely?

Salute!  I really appreciate it.

When will we know if the ETF goes through? What is ETF?

Looks like 1 BC has went to 6900$ish this morning. What do you think it will be at by years end? 
@_date: 2018-08-07 06:22:46
How did you lose access to your wallet?
