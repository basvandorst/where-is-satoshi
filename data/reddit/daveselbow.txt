Sorry for noob question but is there a resource for understanding the sat/byte fee structure (only basically)?, as  I only know normal, low and high priority.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:41:10
Does this work for the U.K. does anyone know?
Edit: no I’ve just tried. U.S. banks only by the looks of it.

Wha wait.. that’s me bro, that’s me.

Nothing to do with jail if Coinbase Custody clients are getting a preferential early service. It happens all the time and I’m not sure that could be termed ‘insider trading’ - just priority service. And, it’s a service for high net worths - why shouldn’t they get services like this?

Fireworks. I’ve shit ‘em.

Yeh I got that wrong - and I’m not the only one. I thought that with all the talk of bitcoin futures and the like that would increase the value of coin and in reality it does nothing to affect the price. Those type of mangers would have to be buying bitcoin for them to affect prices.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:47:47
What so, you are frugal when it comes to day-to-day shopping purchasing, but when bitcoin is mentioned you put on a fau-fur throwaround, a pair of ray-bans, phat chain and throw caution to the wind?......presumably then wreaking in the rewards of that haphazardness bitcoin buying by making it rain with cash with your hands in the air? Is it that type of thing?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:12:37
I know how the Federal Reserve System works just because I got into bitcoin. Everyone is at great pains to point it out, and when you know, you think(well I did) how is that allowed?..
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:40:57
GDAX, for the U.K., for buying small weekly amounts, is not fun I can tell you.
Edit: solution is to accept some risk and let the coinbase balance build up and do less withdrawals until the bitcoin tx fee’s stabilise/stop with the theft.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:15:09
Excellent, Sir.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:24:57
I know but I’ve got no eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:02:34
I hope somebody someday makes a W/page that shows all the info on that page with an easy to understand summary - no of unconfirmed tx’s/whether that is high low etc/the fee’s that are generally getting the tx’s confirmed/whether or not to use high low or normal fee’s - that kind of thing for the average bitcoin user who wants that info. I have found myself wanting exactly that a few times in the past few weeks. You can ask on here but sometimes it takes ages to get any reply, just sayin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:49:49
Thanks. Even if I got Litecoin or Etherium from CB, I’d still experience the fee’s when I exchanged for bitcoin - u know? I’m buying a flipping moon ticket like a good little convert and all I get to say thanks is robbed by the miners.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:59:25
Isn’t it similar to escrowed so the situation of someone agreeing a transaction and then trying to steal without paying, or trying to reverse the transaction afterwards - this has already been thought of.

You say ‘he’ - do you know something I don’t?

Wow. Shoutout on reddit.... I’ve made it man, (I’ve made it)
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:52:04
So that was my next thought - what format was it most likely to be in? And you have an answer to that. So because SN was/is old school, he would use the 256 bit key format. So, entirely long and random and never would have been a word format then. I see. No chance in other words. Interesting though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:30:49
So are you saying you believe there will be another financial crisis soon. When?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:11:05
Of course, it seems obvious now - wallets (and password protected wallets) for bitcoin weren’t around when SN mined those coin.

translated to take it to copay there is a problem with their code. They do have custom fields, all mine were set to normal for the fee but I can’t understand the fluctuations with the same wallet, address, time period, amounts, it’s fucking odd mate.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:42:31
Is that kind of shit normal then. Fee’s that seem to be made up on the spot?
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:51:57
Thank you sir
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:13:55
With the way btc is appreciating like mad atm, buy bitcoin with the money and hodl. Infinitely more profitable than putting money into personal asic mining. You don’t get the heat though.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:51:39
Thank you sir
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:44:07
And consider that one of bitmains early asic competitors, in relation to the level of investment into mining of their rival, stated “We have tried to calculate the amount of money that the Chinese have invested in mining; we estimate it to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Even with free electricity we cannot see how they will ever get this money back. Either they don’t know what they are doing, but that is not very likely at this scale or they have some secret advantage that we don’t know about.

I’ve just done a similar thing but with heroin addiction. In a little over 2 months it’s growing well, I like it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:49:33
They used to be able to accept U.K. ‘Faster Payments’ like you say, but have now removed that option.

Call bs. How the fuck has this guy come through a few all time highs without telling his wife so far? It’s not like they’re well off, money would have been a sticking point, I just cannot believe that this guy, probably getting an ear-full on more than a few occasions about money from wifey, and only now he wants to? Nah.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:28:31
In your opinion

Is there any real time information for bitcoin network congestion? Is it clear yet?
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:40:18
Well, ok, change the wallet you say? It was copay wallet on iOS, all from same address like I have said and within half an hour. All the fee’s were set to normal, and still I got wild fluctuations. So you are saying there may be a problem with the copay wallet? And/or I was doing the fee settings wrong? What do I do in future to avoid this situation then..?
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:24:48
I’m sure I got hammered on Monday with transaction fee’s.

Yep I buy btc on cc every week
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:12:30
Transaction fuckery for me. These 3 tx all on same day within half hour. All from same wallet + address.
4:08pm. Sent 0.134359btc £840.56  tx fee was 0.000623btc £3.90  0.46% of tx
4:34pm. Sent 0.006456btc £40.39  tx fee was 0.001035btc £6.48  13.82% of tx
4:43pm. Sent 0.008104btc £50.70  tx fee was 0.000387btc £2.42  4.56% of tx
All the transaction fee’s were set to normal, so is there any explanation for what seems like me getting wildly fucked over in fees that don’t have any basis in maths.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:44:06
Sorry about that - that’s my commitment - getting the news up first without reading it all myself. A rookie mistake, if you will. They probably don’t have any new developments anyway. 
Edit: Incidentally, you can read it for free - create a free account. And no they don’t have any new developments,  one or two new comments from a mildly relevant person.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:09:44
Do you see any problems with Coinbase not wanting to send a customers funds to, or through, an ‘intermediary’? (Like problems with they’re insurance, for example) I use the term ‘intermediary’ loosely.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:56:31
What happens if there is a major problem with your application, which then affects Coinbase’s capacity to operate as the highly successful exchange that they are?
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:23:07
Somebody already has - sponsored a sled team with bitcoin. This and more olympics funded.
