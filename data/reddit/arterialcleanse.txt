You did not reply to him already.  These are entirely different points.  Also, your guys that DID support larger blocks don't anymore publicly.  Ask them!  LOL.  
Your points are entirely voided.

How is this normal?  
Also, we're not talking about job applicants.  My post is about billionaires.  Not sure where that came from but I am interested in how you can justify this being normal anyhow.

Let's say I am a bigot.  Does that explain the fact that every one of our politicians is a complete sycophant to Israel?  
You're deflecting.  Why are you deflecting?  It seems defensive.  My post merely gives a reason as to why they are doing this.  I could be totally wrong but I've just never seen a politician behave this way unless there was profit potential or media concerns if they didn't.
Your comment is a canard because you're attempting to distract from the issue at hand.

No.  Banks, including the central bank create money from nothing.

Especially if your friends and family determine whether you get a loan or not.

I actually would expect that.  It's not popular to point it out.  I'm calling out brigading because of the time period.  It literally dropped 10 points in around 2 minutes whereas it took an hour to get to 10 points.  Anyhow, just a hunch.  I could be wrong.
Also, regardless of whether people think I'm batshit crazy.  I posted facts.  Google them if you don't believe me.

I'm not barking up the wrong tree.  I'm aware it sounds mean.  However, they represent around 2% of our country.  The numbers don't line up even if you do account for exceptionalism.
Also, recognizing fact doesn't make you a bad person.  How you choose to respond to facts is what determines that.  One person can look at this with hate in their hearts while another will just want things to be equitable.

It's time to face the truth.  You can only live in denial for so long.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:10:53
That's a canard.

How is pointing out fact anti-jewish?  I can just as easily say you denying statistics is anti-others.

Once again that doesn't account for the numbers.  Asian people value education and rigor over comfort.  Asian Americans account for over 5% of the population whereas Jewish people account for 2%.  
The numbers don't align.

I'd vote like hell for him.  I'd vote for him twice if I could.  A LOT of people want ANY DAMN THING that is real change.

I like Avast.
