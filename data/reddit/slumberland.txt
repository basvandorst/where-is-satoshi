I used bitpay in opencart. I haven't sorted out how to display prices in bitcoin yet, but its a viable checkout option. No one has used it, to date. It took me about a half hour to set up bitpay and set up a waller. 75% of my coins get immidietely converted to fiat, with reaaaaallllly low fees, and the remainging 25% go to my wallet.

I'll see if its possible (for me). I'm no great shakes on the technical end so I'll sort out what I can.
Thanks for the ideas.

All the setup was incredibly easy. I say that having not tested it at all.
I've been talking to one guy interested in paying in bitcoins, so i'm excited to try it and make sure it works properly.

we'll see ;) the feds are trying to fuck us both

Most of my users tend to be on the younger side because I'm selling niche advanced products, but unless they're mining coins, they tend not to even know how bitcoins work. Having a go explaining it in the ecig IRC on freenode - as i'm sure you know theres a lot of misconceptions about bitcoin (goes well with ecigs that way :P)

I also sell ecig related hardware. Most of my business (99%) is through a high risk credit card processor. The entire time i've taken CC, I've also taken bitcoin (I use opencart and bitpay)
Unfortunately, I've had only 2 coin based sales, both to the same person, in 8 months or so.

just did. I figured I can try 25% bitcoin :)

e-cigarette and related vaporizer hardware. I've been on both ends of paypal disputes. If a paypal like service for coins existed, i might use it, but my suppliars likes being paid in fiat, because thats how they buy their boats... er... pay their workers &lt;_&lt;

I've always loved paypal.
AS a buyer
as a seller, I won't use it ;) their TOS won't let me

slumberlandindustries.com, bitpay should be set up. not much for sale atm

i'll  leave it at 25% until the first transaction, just to make sure everything works ok, then you're right, I don't think it'll be enough volume that I couldn't hold onto them, as I read more. Im excited for my first whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:29:48
i've set it high (25% bitcoin) for now. If i get a lot of business, I'll probably reduce it, but wanna have a bitcoin &lt;_&lt;
Whats a good way to find others in the bitcoin economy where i can spend my bitcoins?
