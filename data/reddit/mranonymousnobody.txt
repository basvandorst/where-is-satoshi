Or maybe people are tired of the government stealing THEIR money. Fuck the IRS, Government, and shitty cucks like yourself.

Snowflake? Do you normally just call people products of extreme weather? You go ahead and keep getting cucked by other men who want your money. I'll put up my middle finger and keep my 100%. Sheep.

Lol. Do you think Mr.AnonymousNobody gives any fucks that are flying? Nope. Because the government can eat a dick. Plus, prove I even own coins. Can't. Sheep.

Well, shucks. You didn't return me being an asshole with assholeness. Now I feel like a bigger asshole. But fix that shit! That's a cool design.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:34:58
This is me. Haha

Nice! Glad to be of service even though I was being an asshole. Fuck me, I need to stop. Keep doing your thing and I hope you are successful AF. Except for the Bcash thing. Fuck that. And SV. Fuck that too. hahaha

Ethereum is spelled wrong you dolt! Lemme guess... Not a designer, business man or spelling bee champ? Your shop is essentially an anemic redbubble.

I'll share my method. I created a crossword puzzle using my seed words. I think it's a great idea, and nobody will ever think a crossword puzzle has anything to do with my funds. Except Reddit.

Thank you. I actually have a few uses for this. Appreciate it.

Well... Here's some advice: You need all designs to be available in black. I, for one, only buy black shirts. That's it. $31 is too high for a shirt. Most I'd EVER pay is $24.95. Otherwise, I'm going down to T-Shirt Mart and bootlegging the motherfucker. Also, Bitcoin is king. Cater to BTC. Monochromatic is better than color. Stay away from shirts that look like fruit striped gum exploded all over the fuckdamn. Don't shy away from controversy. Be controversy. Accept BTC. Oh, and buy my Cryptokitties.
