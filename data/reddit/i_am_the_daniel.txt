Calculate in the currency that you would transfer back to. If your country uses euros, then calculate in that.

Who wants shitcoins when you can have bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:46:18
I believe it already is.
Edit: Maybe its not, i'm sure I saw it was the other day.
EDITEDIT: Ah, i just checked again and it is. You have to choose how many 'Creddits' it is you want to buy (mine is in USD even though im from the Uk) and then you can choose how to pay for it. Bitcoin is an option.

As someone fairly new to BTC I still get a little tingly feeling  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) at each 1k that passes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:09
In that case, may we all go to the moon! :)

Well yeah, kinda. You can buy 1 BTC at $14k or something right now. If you buy for 14k today and its at $16k tomorrow then you can sell for $16k and would've made $2k profit.

I've made £3 so something like $5, and I feel like i'm ballin'.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:07:30
Thanks for all the replies. I'm definitely going to be buying direct. £10 could save me a lot of money in the long run if the device has been tampered with from a secondary seller.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:43:04
I use coinbase.
I use a banking app called Revolut, which allows me to change GBP into EUR at no cost. Then I can transfer the euros to Coinbase through a banktransfer/SEPA for free. It's an extra step but it saves tonnes in fees.
Also can send it back to revolut in euros and change back to GBP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:03
Don't dwell on the past. No-one would have predicted todays prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:50
Probably less trading in $ right now, Europe just woke up while its still middle of the night for America
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:57
I've now made a months wage with bitcoin ;p
I'm not buying and selling, just hodling, but still, if i wanted out now I wouldn't technically need to work for the next month!
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:04:35
Bitcoin is struggling due to it being so close to 10,000EUROS, it keeps nearly hitting and then dipping. It's having an effect on the $ price. I can't see it hitting it today tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:09:25
Lol I work a part-time job, haven't particularly put much into bitcoin and i've already profited more from BTC than i would make in 2 and a half weeks at work. (Sort of 20-30hrs worth of work)

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:32:16
meh! Everyone is waiting for the 20k now
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:23
I know, I know.
It's just if I was to convert back to FIAT now, at current prices, that I would have made my monthly wage.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:37
And now the USD market its starting to catch up slightly
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:21
I did too, I for some reason wrote coinbase. 
But yeah same still applies. It's not going to be a buy/sell platform as far as i know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:55
Just remember, until you sell the BTC you own, the prices aren't concrete (pun intended). They could still go down. No FUD here just a little warning.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:38:36
All about supply and demand. If people are willing to buy at a higher price it goes up. If people start selling lower than the 'market' price and people buy it, then the price goes down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:38:09
Yes, you sure can. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:10:17
Since i'm fairly new to this, the good ol' pen and paper is working for me atm. Turns out ive made 0.05 Euros. WOOOOP! &lt;-- I've put in only 5 Euros so far just as a tester but i've got more waiting to be put into Coinbase. But yeah, probably will just stick with pen and paper even then.
Edit: I've made 0.10 Euros now that i've just checked WOOOOP!

Let the Hodl memes flow so that people believeeeeeee!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:12
If you do it within normal banking hours it could be same day, from what i've found if you transfer one day, the funds should be in your CB account the next.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:47:16
What does it mean when people say to the moon? As in the price of BTC will sky-rocket?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:04:10
Nice one! You can always re-invest into BTC slowly as to not miss more of the journey :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:17:25
Revolut, the banking app.
Free conversion from GBP to EUR.
Free SEPA payments to coinbase.
No fees involved.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:55:02
They're basically the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:23
NEVER invest more than you're willing to lose. Don't sell your vehicle just to buy BTC if you still need it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:44
Nobody knows. Could continue to the moon, could fall drastically. You tell us what the realistic profit margins are going to be !!
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:02:04
In which case, use the banking app Revolut. It lets me transfer my currency from GBP to EURs then do a bank transfer/SEPA to Coinbase for no cost!

Risks about investing in bitcoin
1. You forget to invest in it.

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:16
They can't tax bitcoin. They can tax it when you convert back to FIAT.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:10:37
Straight back up boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:18:19
£10,000 for us British Bros over here!!!
Yeah buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:46:59
It's working well for me. I can only but BTC with euros but my native currency is GBP. By trading in Euros its worth a fair bit more too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:53:48
You have to send funds to your coinbase account which you can transfer to Gdax(just by signing in with you Coinbase details and clicking deposit-and then select from CB).
I'm not 100% sure on the cryptos that coinbase are adding. It's not going to be like an exchange or anything, just something about seeing what prices they are. You'll have to look more into that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:20:16
All I can say is get him to do his research. It's daunting just being told by someone to 'invest' even if it is describe to them.
