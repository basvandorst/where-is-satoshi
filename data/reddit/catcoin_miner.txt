Yes, do you sell you btc for fiat, or keep the btc?

Gotcha how much bitcoin did all the capital/setup cost.  Do you expect to mine more bitcoin than your capital+setup+operations costs?
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:54:07
That’s why some coins use a tail emission.  Eventually the amount of coins will reach equilibrium with the coins being mined and you will have a more or less static supply.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:25:29
Late question.  How many/what kind of antminers?  Are you holding or selling for fiat or mixture?  Did you look at just spending that capital on the coins instead of miners?

Why not just make block size dynamic?

Just hanging around the internet and trolling people who believe in deities...
I’m more of a reformed flat earthier now though.  If a Christian starts talking to me about Jesus, then I’ll start lecturing them on the Bedford level experiment or whatever, but I’ve (mostly) out grown making fun of Christians.

Good to see a fellow member displaying it proudly.

Pardon the ignorance, but what’s the benefit of having massive number of nodes?
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:31:56
Tough to ignore the price and stuff like memo.

Best troll post of the morning.  Bravo to you sir.  I’m sure the mods are racking their brains for an excuse to delete this post and ban you.  I’m assuming you are speaking to fungibility being required for being money and the requirement for integrated privacy for fungibility.  I.e.  you are a monero fanboi...me too.

Maybe the problem is with bitcoin and maybe the devs should fix it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:39:43
Yea how is that not an F, what fiat hasn’t collapsed?

Sweet it costs less than a dollar to 51% catcoin.

Came here to say this
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:49:49
How much would it cost to do the same thing with bch?
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:44:52
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:04:33
What’s the long answer?
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:13:39
Thank you.  I thought there was something I was missing, it looks like it really is just as simple as  tx’s vs size of ledger...
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:16:07
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:26:34
I’d say I’m ignorant of other reasons. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:53:10


As opposed to never increasing the block size so people can’t use it.  Both camps are acting like drunk toddlers.  Saying one is worse than the other is splitting hairs.

Aaaaaand bitmain announces “new” 10nm ASIC that they have been mining on for 3 months in 3...2...
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:19:00
Except they can’t because the number of tx’s/second is so laughably small.  Easy fix, but you know mut hav small blocks Jenny

You stated something as a representative of a group that you self identify with, but there are plenty of atheists that would disagree with that statement.  I'm not saying I disagree, I'm just saying you aren't stating something that the entire group agrees with.  That and just being a non-believer labeling yourself an atheist is like proclaiming that abstinence is your favorite sexual position.
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:12:26
Ahhhhh I get it, monero is the invisible ninja you DON’T see.

“As an atheist...”, c’mon ur better than that
