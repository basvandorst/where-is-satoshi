I mean, I did a test with a minimal amount.. not sure why I would have to do 20% each time as long as it was tested once. Seems like there would be a massive product flaw there if we couldnt transfer everything properly.

Invest in a HW wallet, there's tons of info on this sub about different wallets to use. The two I'm currently looking into are the ledger s nano and Trezor. There are a lot of people here who are much more knowledgeable than I am though, so don't take my advice as law.

If you did a bank transfer with Coinbase it’ll take about 8 days

Right. Which is why it’s sometimes worth it to suck up the fees for cc’s cus it’s instant transfers. You might pay $20 in fees but you’ll be able to sell at the ATH you want. Doesn’t really seem to matter now that Coinbase crashes when these ATHs hit...

go away

Just buy more now or do nothing. Selling now is not a smart idea.

definitely going to! Gonna go about my day and next time something like this happens i'm gonna pop the question. I can already see this being awkward when they say, "oh.. you're one of those guys?" lol

The money gets taken out of your account after 4 or 5 days, and then takes another 3 or so days to actually get into your coinbase account. Same thing happened to me. You'll be fine, the price at which you bought at was locked in at the time of purchase and now you're really just playing the waiting game. Its frustrating not being able to do anything (move to a wallet or to GDAX) besides watch the value go up, but everything is safe and the transaction will go through in a few days!
