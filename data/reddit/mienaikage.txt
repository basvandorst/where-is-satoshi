I imagine that this will come in handy for international spending, minimal cost for topping up with one currency and using it for another.

I bought a new domain name from namecheap for 0.13Ƀ, and about a month ago I bought a Devil May Cry key for 1.378Ƀ

Mi amas Esperanton kaj Bitmonon :)
I'm not actually sure how Bitcoin would be written in Esperanto so I went for a combination of computer bit (bito) and money (mono).

I'm a little suspicious about the first 2/3 comments on this post being from unused accounts...

Does the cost of the ticket go towards funding the party? With each attendee effectively putting in $1k I'd be expecting something ridiculously extravagant...
To be honest though, I'd rather use the 1 Bitcoin at that point to fund a decently awesome party with my friends.

Fuck that. If I was a girl planning on attending I would be immediately put off by the fact that some will bet against my attendance and be unhappy about my mere presence.
How about we make these events more accessible and appealing to women rather than alienating them?
