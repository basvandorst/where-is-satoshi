Okay. Thanks for the help, really appreciate it!

So I should wait till the blockchain is downloaded and test with a tiny amount of BTC?

"High" is relative to what it was. I actually lost a little money at this point so I consider this price "low".
If you wanna trade, not the current price is important (considering you can buy fractions of bitcoins too!) but the precentage of value increase.

Generally I wouldn't suggest to store your bitcoins in an online wallet at all. If you wanna store it safely, make yourself a paper wallet. The odds of someone breaking into your home and realizing what it's worth is much lower than someone hacking into the online wallet provider.
If you need help or explanation regarding paper wallets, give me a shout.

Free money from an internet site? Must be totally legit!

An immediate solution would be to make a new wallet, transfer all funds and delete the old one.
That way in the blockchain, the info could be traced up to you sending BTC to someone else. Nobody knows that someone else is in fact you again.

This should be stickied. Like... forever.

Is there a chance the wallet doesn't work correctly?
I'm just letting armory download the blockchain, which is taking ages ;)
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:02:30
Didn't do it yet. Armory is at 94% download now, you think it's worth to stop it and download and do the bootstrapping?

To 3: The chance of you being struck by a lightning while crashing down in an airplane driven by a one legged monkey which is reading Shakespeare is probably magnitudes higher than getting a collision.
