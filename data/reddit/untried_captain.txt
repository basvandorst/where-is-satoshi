I said 'worth doing **right**'. Combining SW and a blocksize increase wouldn't be safe. SW is a soft fork and will be deployed the same way as OP_CLTV. You can argue that a block size increase should be higher priority than SW, but hard forks are reserved as an option of last resort.
Neither I nor anyone else thinks the size should stay at 1MB forever, but the fact is that an increase is not necessary.

What you're relying on right now is security through obscurity.The fact is that not many people use bitcoin, let alone in person. If more people start using bitcoin, it's only a matter of time before double spend wallets become common. It's similar to how Macs didn't have viruses for the longest time... the target market was just too small and not worth attacking.

The bitcoin network relies on a consensus protocol.

You guys really should stop repeating this fear mongering bullshit. Blocks are fine. They're not being maxed out and there's not even a transaction backlog. 0-conf was **never** meant to be safe and RBF is a natural progression regardless of Core's actions.

Let's face it. Bitcoin in its current form is a pretty shitty payment network for retail transactions. It works well when you're shopping from home and don't mind waiting around 10-20 minutes, but buying in person is slow at best, and unsecure at worst. And it doesn't scale well either. 
The actual payment network is coming. SW will solve transaction malleability and reduce block size pressure. LN will provide instant and secure payments which are far superior to 0-conf. And it's scalable too.

You won't have to pay anyone to set up a LN node. The only thing you'll have to pay for is standard bitcoin transaction fees for opening/closing channels. There may also be compensation for LN nodes that help process payments, but this is expected to be very negligible and calculable before sending.

Pretend Overstock is using Core and Dell is using XT. You can use old coins to buy sheets from Overstock, and those same coins to buy hardware from Dell. Once the losing chain fails, one of those companies will be holding the bag.
Maybe you buy some coins from localbitcoins. The seller sends you XT coins but they're not accepted anywhere. You might get paid to your SPV wallet and show the transaction as verified, but the next time you connect, you get an XT node that returns zero balance for your addresses.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:19:17
So you can use a coin and flip it 256 times to get a 256-bit sequence. How do you know how many times to roll a dice with 6 or even 10 sides to get 256 bits of entropy? The other posts say 60 rolls is enough, but bitaddress says 99 rolls. 
I don't understand the connection between 256 bits and the number of sides your coin or die has. Are all of these 256-bit numbers? Because their result is about 78 digits long or what? 
A coin flipped 256 times: 2^256 has 78 digits
A six sided die rolled 99 times: 6^99 has 78 digits. 
A ten sided die rolled 77 times: 10^77 also has 78 digits. 
Is it right to say that a ten sided die rolled 77 times has the same amount of entropy as a coin flipped 256 times? And why 10 words for a diceware passphrase? Wouldn't that be 6^50? That result is only 39 numbers long...  Sorry, this stuff is confusing to me.

I've already stated that you will generally get *slightly* lower specs with Apple hardware, but in my experience, the comfort, reliability, lifespan and overall user experience is simply incomparable. Throw in a pretty solid UNIX-based OS and you've got a great platform. I'm obviously not the only one who understands this either, as evidenced by Apple's bottom line. I've found that I can do 98% of anything that can be done on a non-Mac machine, and generally that missing 2% comes from a software developer's lack of cross-compatibility which, again, is not hardware related.

That's incredible. It's actually making sense now. I don't know why I was thinking the number of digits were important, but I guess they are. just not in the way that I thought.
I made a chart to make sure I'm understanding you and I think it's working well.  Very cool to see the relationships between throws and the number of sides (or outcomes) are possible. 
Last question is about your diceware paragraph:
To generate 10 words, you need to roll a die 5 times per word, for 10 words. That equals 50 throws, or 6^50. As my chart shows, the entropy is exactly the same (roughly 130 bits), which is to be expected. However, the Diceware wordlist can contain words and numbers of various length, so I wonder if the Diceware password might be even stronger than just the raw dice sequence, because it's possible that the attacker doesn't know what wordlist you used.
My sample 10 word diceware phrase:
"burt chaff feud heine macho norway pygmy rouge tyburn tun"
There are 57 characters, each with 27 possibilitys (including the space). So, log2(27^57) = 271 bits!  And that grows dramatically when I include capital letters, numbers, and special characters. Is it correct to say that a Diceware passphrase is more secure than the actual raw dice sequence? Thanks for your patience and your amazing explanations.

Let's say *my friend* has a dedicated server that he uses as a bittorrent seedbox and he doesn't want to draw too much attention to it. He wants to run a full node on the same server, but isn't sure how much attention it would draw. Is this concern legitimate? He also looked into VPS services, but they're very expensive, and the basic plans won't even hold the entire blockchain.

Many people shop at Amazon because it's convenient, cheap, and has a huge selection. Naturally it's the site to compare other sites to. There are other sites that accept bitcoin, but they are usually very expensive by comparison, which is why it's nice to find one that is closer to Amazon.

On the contrary, my 6 year old Macbook is kind of a frankenstein. I've maxed out the ram, replaced the HDD with an SSD, and replaced the optical drive with a large capacity 2.5" platter drive. Not only that, I've dropped it about a half dozen times and it's still running smoothly, save for a couple dings and dents.

Raising the limit doesn't solve transaction malleability, nor does it enable any of the other cool shit that SegWit does, like *actual* scaling solutions. I don't see how you can say they "want to do nothing" and then refer to SegWit. Do you honestly think SegWit is "nothing"?

Satoshi set the block size limit at 1 megabyte to prevent DOS attacks via transaction "spam". The only times that the network has actually reached capacity was during "spam" attacks, meaning it's misguided to claim we should remove this protection to make the jobs of spammers easier. Nobody's saying that buying a latte with bitcoin is "spam" — just that using the network isn't free.
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:54:41
Moving the goalposts. If full nodes want to maintain full security, they should upgrade. This is better than booting them off the network completely which would damage Bitcoin's network effect. But it's very likely that they will upgrade because the benefits are substantial.

Spam won't stop, but it will become increasingly expensive. 
That bitcoin is more valuable now is all the more reason to keep the limit low to help prevent spam. Full blocks are a *good* problem to have, because it means the network is being utilized. Adoption is not stagnating because of the cap. That's just false. It's stagnating in part because there's still not enough benefit over current payment networks.

It's not just Mike who's frustrated. It's everyone. But we have to remember that Mike ostracised himself by attempting to deploy an extremely contentious hard fork against the advice of the vast majority of the tech community. So while I empathise with the community's frustration, I can't empathise with Mike because he's clearly the key instigator in this whole mess.
@_date: 2015-09-29 09:07:44
Congratulations to Mike for turning a civil debate into a civil war. All he's really accomplished is turning the tech community against him and wasting everyone's time when they could be working on actual scaling solutions.

Mike, you obviously didn't even bother to watch the conference or you would know it was absolutely not a waste of time.
Gavin tweeted this video as [the most important content from Scaling Bitcoin]( In it, Gabriella Colemas discusses why meeting face-to-face is so critical to many open source projects for numerous reasons. 
To hear you describe such conferences as 'a waste of time' and 'just theatre' is incredibly disheartening. It demonstrates what many in the tech community have suspected, which is that you're simply not interested in working together with the rest of the tech community to deploy amicable solutions for the betterment of Bitcoin. 
If the number one advocate for BitcoinXT can't be arsed to show up for a conference and make his case to the rest of the community, then it casts serious doubts on your motives. The next time someone says that you're being exiled, the truth will be that you've exiled yourself.
@_date: 2015-09-29 11:21:34
No, don't be an idiot. There are several hundred members in the tech community who are in no way affiliated with Blockstream. It's safe to say the vast majority of them oppose contentious hard forks.
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:40:51
Hi Mike, are you going to the conference in Hong Kong? You should. I'm just wondering because you said the Montreal conference was a waste of time, but everybody else was there sharing their research. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 23:36:39
then go there!

They don't accept Visa or MasterCard either. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 14:46:46
Well at least you didn't skip Jeff's talk, but it was only one of many excellent topics! The organizers did a great job of keeping the conference structured and ontopic. They made it clear that specific proposals would be kept until the Hong Kong conference. Maybe collaborating on research with others is a little amateurish for you, but people missed out on your insights. There's still time for you to attend Hong Kong, which is where actual proposals and counterproposals will be discussed. If scaling bitcoin is important to you, you'll be there.
I don't buy the travel time excuse.  There were people from all around the world in attendance, and the organization even offers travel subsidies for people who can't afford it. We all make sacrifices and it's not like we all live in Hong Kong either. The question isn't about the perceived value of your credibility. It's about your refusal to cooperate with anyone else.
@_date: 2015-09-28 11:48:51
They're doing it in defiance of BIP101. The message is loud and clear.
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:02:41
That's completely false. There were about a dozen great research talks and round tables, as well as countless discussions during and after the event. Meeting in person is extremely valuable and productive.

Mike knows perfectly well that Sidechains were never proposed as a scaling solution. He also knows full well that Lightning will **dwarf** BIP101's approach, even with the max block size of 8GB. He's being purposefully deceptive and the level of arrogance he's displaying is off the charts.
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:19:30

@_date: 2015-11-26 17:30:20
What are you even talking about? Pretending that Mike was persecuted isn't helping your cause. He made his own choice to not attend either conference. XT was his baby, so it was up to him to support it or drop it. He's made his choice there to. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:35:45
Why waste everyone's time with bullshit though? XT is just a patch of Core that has zero support and doesn't even qualify as bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:51:51
XT was an attempt to make Bitcoin into Bankchain.

And now you just happen to be working for them. 


Hey, tell us again how you coined SPV as mentioned in the white paper.
@_date: 2015-11-22 01:37:23
This ignorant anti-Blockstream rhetoric is embarrassing. Saying that Blockstream wants to 'cripple and destroy bitcoin' is just stupid. Funny that you say a bitcoin network only accessible by banks and wealthy isn't want you signed up for, yet you're supporting Mike Hearn, who wants to build a competing network **only accessible by banks and wealthy**. LN **is** Bitcoin in the same way that multisig is Bitcoin. It's nothing more than two parties exchanging pre-signed multisig transactions back and forth, only it's done in a way that eliminates counterparty risk. You don't have to use it, but you'd be a fool to ignore the benefits. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:15:32
Nothing changes in that regard. Non-RBF transactions are the same as ever, while RBF transactions will warn the recipient. Bitcoin is pretty shitty for in-person retail payments and was never meant for coffee. You don't need an immutable record of something so trivial.

Since when is 10 minutes permanent? If you're trusting 0-conf transactions, you're doing it wrong.

Dropping transactions at random is NOT a realistic solution. Consider some peer review for once.
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:53:18
Gavin also said he won't be going. If they don't care enough about their proposal to even bother going, why should anybody else?
@_date: 2015-11-15 20:21:06

Again, what are you talking about? Mike **chose** not to go to either conference. Gavin, the author of BIP101, also is not going. Why do you expect someone else to waste everyone's time if the proposal's author won't even bother to show up? will be presenting "BIP101 block propagation data from testnet", so it's not as if BIP101 is being excluded.

I asked him if he was planning to attend the Hong Kong conference on scaling or if he was going to blow it off like the last one. I never got such an [arrogant reply]( before. He thinks that meeting face-to-face to exchange ideas, discuss technical aspects and debate proposals with developers and miners is **'a waste of time'** and **'just theatre'**. He's extremely self-righteous and refuses to even acknowledge other viewpoints. Now I'm actually wondering if he's a compulsive liar too.

@_date: 2015-10-01 10:41:20

There hasn't been any DoS for at least a month and the 20% dropoff started at the same time as the malleability attack. XT nodes are crashing. The mempool limit is not only a shitty hack, it also doesn't even work. Just increase the relay fee instead of dropping transactions at random.
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:51:25
You're being ridiculous. Grow up.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:08:47
Stop ignoring the fact that most Bitcoin users acknowledge that inventions like Lightning Network will require bigger blocks. If anything, XT users are trying to coerce everyone else into bigger blocks as the *only* solution. Even Mike Hearn refuses to acknowledge the scaling potential of Lightning Network far outweighs the likelihood of centralization due to gargantuan blocks.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:57:45
Yes, it can. Lightning Network will scale far beyond a simple block size increase. The vast majority of today's transactions aren't a component of everyday commerce, nor do they need to be written to the global ledger before settlement.
@_date: 2016-05-08 17:26:52
Your double standards are showing.
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:20:24
My node has **never** crashed.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:41:05
There is no consensus to allow miners or spoofers to vote on a hard fork. Your node contains code that would do exactly that. Consensus failure is the biggest threat to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:48:31


If that were true then 20% of BitcoinXT nodes would not have dropped offline. Dropping random transactions is a shitty hack. Talk about poor technical judgement.
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:46:52
No, because he was already proven wrong by the success of the first conference.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:43:30
We only have one chance at this. It's way too early for rogue developers to be deploying shitty hacks to 'solve' something that's much better solved by simply configuring nodes to reject spam.

@_date: 2015-10-08 19:16:03
There's no need for insults. 
Dropping transactions at random is not the same as 8MB blocks. Dropping transactions at random is nothing more than a shitty hack in your own words. 
Nobody wants 1MB forever. Stop making shit up. It makes you look foolish.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:17:01

I'm not offended. If you're offended then you should just think about it.
Szabo is right. Remember how Gavin and Mike said 95% consensus would be desirable, but that they knew they couldn't get 95%, or even 85% so they decided to go with 75%? They're actually willing to compromise the entire network to force their agenda through.
Turns out they can't even get 2%, but let's assume they could get 75% and actually cause a fork. I guarantee that the next contentious proposal will aim for 65%, and ultimately miners will be constantly defending the network from 51% attacks on the protocol.

Nobody is saying that. It's a given that the Lightning Network will require a block size increase.

You have it all wrong. Blockstream is pure Bitcoin. R3CV hired Mike Hearn to develop their own centralized/permissioned block chain.

@_date: 2015-10-08 22:07:53
It's undeniable that Mike Hearn has gone rogue. He's attempting to subvert consensus rules for his own gain even if it means resorting to substantial dishonesty. 
Dropping random transactions is a shitty hack because it doesn't address the issue and has failed peer review. The only solution at this time is to increase fees above the spam fee threshold. The spender has to want their transaction to be confirmed more than the spammer. That's the tradeoff.
