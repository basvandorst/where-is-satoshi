Thanks cid42.
Is it possible to do multiple sha256 with the password? sha256 x 25 (password)
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:32:12
Hi this is the example I have in my mind.
First it will start at private key(decimal form just for example) 1,
second is private key 124,
third is private key 235,
fourth is private key 333,
and so on.. all the succeeding keys are random.
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:13:30
I have seen this site, however it does print all the addresses and keys. What I am looking for is it would start at 1 then the next could be 124 or any number at random but still in sequence.
thank you :)
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:15:18
thanks but im not looking for conversion tools....
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:44:58
Is there online tool for that?
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:21:42
In electrum, I used the wif private key to load up the address but I see no option in menu to get the xprv.
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:49:39
If I get the xpub, is there a program to get xprv having the xpub, wif and index?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:01:06
Where to input this?
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:57:37
oh great thanks. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:31:34
Thanks but this kinda different

is the public key the witness?
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:17:07
nope I didn't get it from any lyrics, poem or books.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:18:28
yes. I'm currently googling for the same error.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:45:11
thanks but I can't shell out any money right now.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:50:06
yeah I'm currently looking for working implementation with that given equation. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:35:44
im currently studing python in virtual env
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:30:27
im using python2.7 in my virtual box
I already cloned the file and successfully run the setup.py
Then I don't know what's next since there is a limited info on the README
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:11:53
sorry but what is IRC?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:41:28
what if the user wants to use 32byte hex instead of a string and integer?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:39:07
It's a task assigned to me from my boss. Most of the online tool can convert a single base58 to base16 since but I have to convert thousands of addresses that will take me some time though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:05:38
0phtcrack or 0phcrack?
Can't find 0phtcrack.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:35:02
hi I tried the repository but it gave me an error: 
Invalid Character.
Base58.txt is all base58 addresses no other contents.
I'm wondering what is the invalid character it is referring to
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:33:05
will it also accept integer password?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:37:02
If I will going to use an integer as a password is this the correct code?
hash = hashlib.sha256(str(password) + str(n)).hexdigest()
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:36:43
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:05:17
"taking transfers from Nigerian Prince" huh??
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:29:03
I mean before the program show a keypair it will check first the blockchain if it is unused.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:04:51
what would be the cracking method for that?
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:53:08
I hope they will have ruby and sapphire too. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:36:29
what do you mean by ascii13 line endings? there's nothing but base58 addresses in the file.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:02:01
Follow up question how can I identify the sighash type used in the transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:08:31
yeah Ive been playing around with pybitcointools but it's too advance that's why I'm looking for much simple code :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:44:26
how would I know if im using a bad wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:04:21
I have thousands of deterministic address to convert to base16
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:23:00
Were there a cryptocurreny law that covers fraud? If there is it may not be a good idea to steal coins.
And moving huge amount of coins can be easily identified though.
Lucky they were.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:32:16
oh okay thanks for the info.
follow up question since it is related with creating transaction.
If the spender chose the Sighash_all
does that mean the receiver can modify the signature and pubkey?
"SIGHASH_ALL, the default, signs all the inputs and outputs, protecting everything except the signature scripts against modification."
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:21
Is it the same as DUP HASH160 [hash] CHECKSIG EQUALVERIFY?
It is only spendable if the owner provide its corresponding private key?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:15:52
I have asked in stackexchange though some claims there's no such thing
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:07:52
oh.. how do they calculate the keys in that site?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:53:59
thank you
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:49:53
oh. I'll send you a private msg.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:37:33
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:02:52
It worked! I used a different text editor. thank you
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:42:15
Im developing a small program that accept a string then convert it to a hash then (if possible) reverse.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:06:33
thanks. but is it possible to use hex instead of an integer?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:49:51
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:32:32
Thank you for all of your responses. Currently using the libsecp256k1 for generating addresses. This is for mathematical and theoretically study only. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:19:53
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:04:22
I mean does brainwallet address also have 2^256 search space or it is much smaller space?
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:20:16
public address is different from public key.
@_date: 2018-07-31 07:23:01
assuming I have approximately 100 mnemonic seeds that would take me a lot of time to derive my btc addresses for each.
