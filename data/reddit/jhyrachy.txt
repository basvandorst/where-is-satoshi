I'm in Italy and i would really love to buy some bitcoin from them, but i'm a student and I do not have a bank account, only a prepaid card, so I'm pretty much fucked :c
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:30:51
You forgot the /s
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:55:05
I never tought that was possible. thanks for your explanation!
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:57:54
Thanks for the links!
It's really interesting!
especially the Namecoin thing, i have a lot more to study now!

I don't think it's easy.
I think that when bitcoin become mainstream each government will require "verified" bitcoin address and i'm pretty sure they are going to share their archive each other.
100% sure this will happen inside USA and EU, and this is what matter to the average people.
Also you do not need to track everyone, just the knowledge that your entire expense could be checked any time will scare people to try to not use verified account

Ok, let's say i'm the government.
I'm going to allow ONLY registered address, so if i catch you using another bitcoin address i'll punish you like you were sending money to a tax heaven.
Now you are screwed.
I can track all your income and expenses without even the need of a legal process.
I can check where you spend your money, and if i find digital transfer other a certain amount to an unregistered address, or little amounts to multiple unregistered address, I'll ask you to explain whete this money gone, or i'll charge you for fiscal evasion.

ok, so I would have needed to mark it as 'replaceable'
too late :c
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:42:54
you are right, but when your transaction is stuck for 75 hours, you get a bit salty
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:49:50
any guide to use RBF?
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:35:10
bitcoin.info wallet.  
I know, it's not the best
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:33:49
not if the second time i double the fees
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:57:59
ye, was looking in to it.
But since the transaction is not marked as 'replaceable', looks like my only option is CPFP
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:42:36
Ok, so since I spend the change from transaction 1, I force, with transaction 2, fees, miners to process transaction 1.
thanks, now I get it! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:25:02
You can do CPFP even if you have just the sender private key.
I'm trying to understand if with CPFP from sender where the coins go (to the first or the second wallet)
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:28:03
yep, I learnes my lessons for the new transactions I'll make.
But how to unstuck this one?
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:18:43
Do you think that Bitcoin is just an experiment? A transition phase to a better cryptocoin? Or that Bitcoin in it's current form it's here to stay?
Banks will be glad to adopt a currency where they have no power and where they have not participated in his construction? Or they'll make their own cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:08:41
Oh, thanks for the info
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:42:57
Just a question:
If bitcoin value increase, and we must increase transaction value to keep them processed fast, since btc is not infinitely subdividable and miners can refuse to mine under a certain amount, can we meet a point where few huge miners choose to mine only big transactions, artifically increasing the cost for sending bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:16:52
And make hundred of peoples that are not bankers insanely rich?
Are you crazy?
But seriusly, i'm pretty sure that banks will invest in their own cryptocurrency, not in one where they can't put their nose.

Localbitcoin is good, but all the seller I contacted wanted around the same percentage of the exchanges for the "service" they provide.
So this 0 fees promotion is really good 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:25:35
I always tought that bitcoin has a great potential, but it was born more like a proof of concept, not with the intention to become something this big.
Obviusly the core, the blockchain tecnology, is here to stay, but not in the current form.
Just my 2 cent
