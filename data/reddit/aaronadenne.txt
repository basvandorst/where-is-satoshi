Localbitcoins is where I always buy from. I'm from the UK, believe it works in the US too. You don't need an ID unless you do high value transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:15:29
So you're against bigger blocks? If so, why?
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:53:29
Good point.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:50:02
Lol. I wonder if anyone has created this but with more carriages and Bitcoins in them hmm
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:36:11
oh I remember these. I forgot all about those. Thank you for reminding me :D
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:32:47
xapo.com They've been going for years.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:01:06
Yes, YouTube is the place to go.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:16:33
I can see why you have came to this conclusion. What are your thoughts on Xapo being in control of Hedge Fund companies bitcoins etc.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:07:57
Yeah, he's a troll just like the coin. I'm out.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:48:19
Haha love this
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:17:16
Yes incredibly "unlikely". Stop playing on my words it's annoying. But we're still talking atoms in the universe. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:00:37
Cheers. I've been using the Coindesk one built into the app, seems a bit flimsy. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:30:13
You could just withdraw cash with your debit card and meet up with someone from Localbitcoins or Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:21:35


@_date: 2017-01-02 04:50:39
It does matter whether it's encrypted or not! People still get into Facebook accounts etc etc, these websites have the best security resources at hand. It's all about how someone can access your wallet not just cracking a password. So we're talking social engineering, keylogging and the list goes on. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:31:11
No. You're misleading people
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:46:21
Why do you think you are unable to withdraw your Bitcoins? Yeah unfortunately it does take a little while for them to respond. I use Wirex, but only transfer what I need from a offline wallet to Wirex (I never store mass amounts - good practice).
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:10:09
Buy the dip. Just never sell. Majority of people like to spread their Bitcoin purchases, so buy once a week. If you believe in Bitcoin, there's nothing to lose (if you don't sell). One more thing, never ever believe strangers online (advice for friend)... so research what me and many others say.
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:51:46
You can't send dogecoins to a Bitcoin Wallet address...
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:38:34
Math. It's impossible to generate the same address.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:12:39
The Trezor wallet does all the work for you. You don't need to download the blockchain. Give someone that Bitcoin Address which they gave you and you'll be able to receive Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:35:08
What difference does it make, someone can still access your key. Encrypted or not. Trezor doesn't even allow access, hence all the authentication just to send Bitcoin from it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:10:00
Go away, you're just a troll on every single reddit post.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:21:01
No. Bitcoin Addresses can be created offline even (in general) All Trezor is doing is giving you an extra layer of security by never revealing your private key (which allows people to spend your Bitcoin). Wheres having a Bitcoin Wallet on a computer or phone the private address is stored on a device which is connected to the internet (prone to viruses etc etc).
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:55:38
Yeah and I'm going to generate your private and public key tomorrow... Bellend. You forgot your reference.
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:33:07
Hold your Bitcoin. I personally believe you will end up regretting trading your BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:36:24
Exactly. I remember buying things for 1 Bitcoin in the early days, back then that converted to £20. I certainly wouldn't buy those things for 1 Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:37:57
Haha I need my cat to do this!
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:40:02
Aww cute! :) Hope we get to see more of The Cat Trader in the future.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:46:57
Impossible, we're talking atoms in the universe impossible.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:16:34
Because you create clickbait posts and comments. How's the up-posts going on your satoshi post? (Don't forget your Doge coin post today)
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:15:14
This is very nice! I love how the web app remembers what I've entered when I return to it. Great job seriously.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:43:17
Well it would be interesting to hear your vulnerabilities as a security researcher myself. I'd much rather have a Trezor, also knowing I can always restore my wallet using the seed created. Over gaining access to even just one of your encrypted or not encrypted wallet.dat files.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:59:33
That is very true and that does happen. This is why I'd highly recommend a hardware wallet. *thumbs up*
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:00:30
What app do you use?
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:39:44
Never ever sell your coins.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:30:12
A few companies don't. This is why we have all the nodes which makes the network.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:04:28
Sorry, the coin was released in 2013. You have seen how much it's grown in four years haven't you? Pretty sure Trump won't want to own a coin with a Doge on it though.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:01:50
I use the KeepKey hardware wallet with Mycelium for Android. I buy Bitcoin with my British pounds via Bank on Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:04:47
Apologies, had another look over the community guidelines. Corrected. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:42:26
It can. You hear of people breaking into homes and emptying them out and stealing their gold, it's very difficult with Bitcoin of course.
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:22:23
I've had no experience with Vaultoto. Someone may disagree with me but obviously Bitcoin has the same attributes as Gold (limited in quantity, demand etc etc) this is why I wouldn't buy Gold. As I see Bitcoin being more valuable (because it can be sent instantly too). To diversify I'm interested in stuff like real estate. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:27:43
Nope. Like the other user said, 99% of them are scam. A real one such as Genesis Mining, you won't see a return for at least over a year and yet any money you do make will be dust money. It's just not worth it.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:20:18
Neither. I don't control the private keys
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:28:25
Thank you everyone, you're replies have been very helpful! 
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:27:12
I listen to this song once every week, no thank you!
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:09:47
Probably some rubbish to do with terrorism 
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:02:49


I like you a lot :)
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:18:21
Haha glad it worked for you :)
@_date: 2016-12-31 22:26:04
In the UK doesn't being a gambling site require you to pay tax etc. I don't know.
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:56:55
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:02:13
Very good point
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:59:13
Eurghhh. You're missing the point, I'm done with you this evening. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:46:29
£134.90 on Amazon in the UK. Wanted to pay with Bitcoin, but then on Purse.io it would take forever to get to me hmm
@_date: 2016-12-31 22:51:58
You could do that but I believe some Bitcoin ATM's scan your ID and hand? I would withdraw cash with my debit card and meet up with people selling Bitcoin. You can use Mycelium and LocalBitcoins.com to find people.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:34:01
Oooo I like this. I'm no expert at mining but I'm guessing the ATMs would be a good target for criminals to steal (for the mining) but also the ATMs would cost an arm and a leg to get a decent ATM miner. Just guessing. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:28:34
What no one has done properly is allow us to view a Bitcoin wallet balance of our choice on Android Wear.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:54:53
This is so cool. Want to be friends? lol
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:21:56
Video: 
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:36:12
Aren't you the troll guy? Selling 5 BTC for Doge. Oooo
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:53:42
Yeah, it's like he's traded a rare car for an ice cream... the hell.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:36:52
Anything where you actually hold your private keys would be a billion times safer than Coinbase, for example Mycelium for Android. But yes, for total security use a hardware wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:59:37
I've been studying and investing in Bitcoin since 2012. The majority of the time Cloud Mining is just a scam, sorry. There are ones such as Genesis Mining, but you won't get your initial investment back for a least a year, the reason being because of the whole Bitcoin Halving and difficulty for when it comes to mining.
The only things I do is:
**Just buy Bitcoin and hold**
I lend Bitcoin out to people at [I removed the link to comply with the community guidelines], you do get a lot of defaulters but it's all about having a good eye and doing research before you lend out. These two things are only good for long term investment.
Sorry if this isn't the answer you wanted
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:13:22
RemindMe! One Year "Remember this brilliant comment?"
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:12:15
Have you tried a different Micro USB cable?
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:30:40
Lol I would rather have Bitcoin which actually has value over an 'I owe you'. 
By the way, I exchange my British pounds via Bank through LocalBitcoins... Easy enough.
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:54:26
Human random really isn't random compared to real random. Yep they're chosen randomly.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:00:17
Accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:05:20
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:32:35
Very true
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:15:36
I wouldn't say so. As long as you created the paper wallet in a secure environment and the private keys haven't touched the internet.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:14:19
Thank you for letting me know
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:55:58


Ashame there isn't a version for Chromebooks etc
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:31:18
On the cleaned up version that seems to be fixed: 
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:34:51
Ah okay. Thank you for letting us know, I thought it was a bit weird.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:55:34
Thank you. Why do you ask? Lol (A hardware wallet)
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:31:00
So... what's the link?
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:54:31
It's been two hours. Can't tell if you're being sarcastic haha
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:27:33
Bitcoin is my Pay-Pal &lt;3
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:31:37
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:39:15
Wirex, you can get a Euro Bitcoin card. But you have to load your Bitcoin to Euros before you can use it. Otherwise, Xapo where you load your Bitcoin and they automatically convert it to the currency. But with Xapo you'll have to pay an exchange fee to Euro's as I believe the card is just for GBP or USD.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:57:32
Ah right. I used the Ledger Hardware Wallet. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:00:16
It's just strange how he vanishes for a year of two and then this.
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:33:05
Hahaha this is brilliant! One of the best comments I've seen in a while
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:56:38
Haha yeah it done it in my sleep. That would of been pretty cool :D
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:13:08
Lol the downvotes, I thought this was funny. *fail*
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:14:24
Thank you for letting me know
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:16:21
I can't wait for the day when decent debt collection companies start accepting Bitcoin as payment. It's always nice to have a service like this, just never wish to use them haha
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:59:21
Thanks bot
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:43:45
I know right, very confusing.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:40:23
@_date: 2017-04-08 08:18:54
Haha this made me laugh!
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:41:30
Yeah that would be something. I think it would be pretty cool that have the public key of the Bitcoin address with the most Bitcoins tattooed on yourself though.
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:26:51
What no one is doing (I think) which I need. Is a way to view what active loans I'm lending out on Poloniex. 
All these apps let you do trading but not view your active loans. I can't even view them on the Poloniex mobile site, I have to switch to the desktop version. I would even pay money if some made this into their app and offered notifications etc.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:07:15
I don't get it
