My suggestion is to add more options than male and female for gender. Some folks don't fit into just those two. It seems insensitive. Thanks for doing this! The site looks pretty engaging and fun :)

Litecoin is a lot faster and cheaper currently. Both have plans to scale via lightning network and atomic swaps.

I think this is one of those reasons that people are holding crypto. I understand wanting to hedge a life-changing sum with USD though.

Because the protocol is still 4x slower and the process to implement segwit and LN is causing a big split in the communities. Bitcoin doesn't need to be coffee payment coin in order to have value. Litecoin is already there though and merchants are switching to it. I think they go well together.
