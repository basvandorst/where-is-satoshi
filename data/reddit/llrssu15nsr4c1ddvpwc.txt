Buy Bitcoin, use the qr code to beep and send coin to the address or use the long address usually underneath to send coin if they're not next to you.

Wow, there's a lot of gold on this thread shame none of it is BTC.

Wow really thought the Guardian was a more reliable source than this. Would expect something like this from tabloid papers.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:57:46
Holy shit dude hope you get it back.

I have a friend who also wants to know this they don't live in Beijing still interested. Heard there's a coffee shop somewhere in Beijing would make sense for there to be a bitcoin ATM near by so you can by it not sure why it's there other wise unless tourism but who's going to fly all that way just to buy a coffee? Better be some fucking good coffee.

Thought this sub didn't allow referral links?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:00:45
I know.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:13:49
Not an ATM at a random coffee shop but one nearby otherwise how you gonna pay for the coffee?!
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:03:45
Can someone confirm if The Guardian is spreading fud or this is real?
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:23:46
Got it
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:23:13
Once SegWit kicks in, yes.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:06:36
When they said bitcoin is volatile I didn't expect this much.
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:30:10
Pay day tomorrow need it to drop again all in on BTC
