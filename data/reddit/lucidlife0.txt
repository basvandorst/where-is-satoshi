What ya'll think. Should I hold off putting more money in till the next dip or nah?
I'm.not quite sure I keep checking the stats for a dip Hut it's not looking like it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:51:36
I’m watching endlessly. Have mad price alerts on Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:49:49
Should people still be buying into bitcoin if they want to make profits or wait till the next dip?
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:42:36
How do I join the chat
@_date: 2019-03-09 23:18:21
That's fucking awesome. Would love to make money from bitcoin but afraid of losing it 
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:53:26

@_date: 2019-10-14 17:44:37
Coinbase pro has foreign tx fees?
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:38:20
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:29:58
That's wierd youd remember. But I lost where to find that post so I'm asking again. I haven't utilized that math equation and so I wanted to recap since I forgot. 
Ive been out of it for months and now starting to get back into it. I'm studying markets before I make any big trades and learning what I can to notice patterns.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:57:33
But the percentages wouldn't represent that? I'd figure that percentage represents what I'm at personally when I bought it last.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:48:52
Soo for instaance. 8,000 - 100 equals = 7000
That doesn't make sense

If it’s limited then how is it freedom shouldn’t everyone be able to have big coin if it means freedom?
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:06:11
Oh OK awesome!
@_date: 2019-10-04 02:57:02
I'm in the process of going through many crypto platforms figuring out which is the cheapest. 
I'm not a big trader but I do actively put money in my acc.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:09:01
Hmm OK. But I bought it when it was at a lower price. Doesn't that mean I'm in the negative or the price in comparison to yesterday is in the negative
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:34:30
How do you calculate that? I always wondered how that works
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:54:58
OK I'll try it!!!
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:52:30
Could.you explain further. I'm terrible with math
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:57:59
So what does this mean for investing. Is there a currency trade here. Any profit to be made?
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:40:43
So I bought it when I was at 8,023 how am I at a negative
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:14:09
I'm learning now!
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:52:13
I wanna throw in $100 but this price rise is making me think I should wait till it lowers. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:05:53
OK I get it! Awesome.
@_date: 2019-06-10 05:00:45

The peso has less value than the dollar atm.

@_date: 2019-06-11 02:54:56

Is there a resource I can learn more about this you may know of?
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:44:56
So  much to read and learn! And damn ya'll went in on me ���� OK OK. I get it. I'll have to do waaay more research. I've been on coinbase but not sure if I like it since the value fluctuates in my wallet.

I want to start investing but I feel it's too late. Can anyone advise? Bless
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:35:28
Just being honest ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:57:32
Well the problem with investing in stocks is that they go down and you have to do much research and have knowledge on Stocks in order to make a profit I am not sure if you’re familiar with Stocks or not but I assume you are so you would know that investing in stocks as a full-time if not more job. I am looking to invest in bitcoin to sell because I want to make money in bitcoin seems like a viable way to do that and yes I am asking in a bit coins sub because I want to know what you people think about that I see a lot of people have much knowledge on it and I am posting it and find out more.
And yes you are a dick but it’s OK I forgive you
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:42:14

I am not using coinbase pro. I trade every 2 weeks or so. I would like to move out of coinbase and save money by using another platform.

"If an Argentinian had bought Bitcoin at the highest point of the ‘biggest bubble in history,’ in 2017, he would have been better off than leaving his money in his Argentinian bank account. So tell me again how Bitcoin is a horrible store of value."
I don't understand how this is. Can someone help explain this?
