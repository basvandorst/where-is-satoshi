Terrible article. Talking about Bitcoin, Worldcoin and Dodgecoin like they are equals and that Bitcoin is less useful because they are expensive???

I like how that graph already includes Bitcoin.
You just can't see it.

Pity all it takes is someone watching over your shoulder in a line somewhere to see your phone unlock (or to use a method of bypassing the unlock) and to steal your phone to get full access. All of those layers of protection are still leaving your phone as a single point of failure.

All that does is prove that the bitcoin side of the exchange is non fractional, there is nothing to stop them running the FIAT side fractionally.

Yes, but what was the total available fee's? Having a glance right now indicates over a 1000 unconfirmed transactions for a total fee of 40mBC, why would you bother putting all of those in?
If adding the unconfirmed transactions increases the chances of your block being beaten to the punch by a 1:625 chance then you are better off not including those and just going for the 25BC reward. So if it takes you over a second to upload your winning block then it isn't worth it. So if your up speed is less than say 200kbps then it makes sense. But I fail to believe anyone is running a major pool with a worse connection than that.

Chances of detecting it through that is the same as solo mining. Any effective detection of this would require a large % of the pools resources
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:39:39
Exsactly so this math was to work out the minimum network speed needed to profitably include all outstanding transactions.

"It’s important to note that CoinDesk’s poll targeted those who already know about bitcoin, so it isn’t clear what the general consensus is on the future price of bitcoin."
Umm, people who don't know about bitcoin are unlikely to have much of a prediction of it's future value.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:57:57
I redid the math and I came out needing a 303kbps up stream to bother including the current outstanding transactions
total fees: 0.0287
total size: 440kb

If you read the article they'd also given themselves unfettered remote access. That security flaw is a greater issue to intelligent people that what amounts to stealing some office supplies (still bad, but probably not worth firing competent employees)

Figure out the ratio of Fees to Reward. Say the fee's are .1BTC. The ratio is 1/250th.
So if your block takes 1/250th of the average block period to send then you lose out by including the transactions. So divide 10 minutes by 250: 2.4seconds. 
If the transactions to include the .1BTC of fees is 400kB then you need a connection that can transmit 400kB in 2.4s = 166kBps. Which is a reasonably fast up stream.
This is the simple case where you assume that getting a block to one other person is enough to get it accepted. but in reality you need more than that so you have to worry about the networks connection speed. Block size matters.

Assume worst case: every hash ends up being 1. Even then the average is the above stated answer

Does buying 10% more coins than they sold really make a country a buyer of coins?
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:14:15
It's not like the coding of it is hard. Just modify the if that chooses which hashes to send to the pool to be if( requestedDificulty &lt; computedHashDificulty &lt; RealBitCoinDificulty )
Someone familiar with the code should manage that in 30 seconds, someone unfamiliar might take an hour.

It'll reflect the centralisation of the economy at large.
Sadly it will push people towards starting inside their bubble, if you are employed by a company owned by a large conglomerate then spending your money at other members of the conglomerate will be more cost effective. It'll be an issue where there are large diverse conglomerates, but less of one when they are smaller.

I know GDP is a great and easy comparison, but the numbers I care about here are more the amount of value that is transacted regularly internally. Unfortunately I think that number is also a lot lower in India. But it is also a lot higher than the current amount of transactions that happen in bitcoin :)

It's why many BBQs in parks are free these days, repairing the damage from people wanting to steal 100 20c peices cost much more than the revenue they gained.
I'm sure less vending machines will be broken into if they only use bitcoin.

Even if they just cycle through 1000 addresses that would work adequately, especially if they only get the next address when a BTC payment is requested.

That is some terrible logic. I am a huge fan of Bitcoin, but the economics experts have spent a lot more time looking at financial systems and are unlikely to be emotionally invested. That is much more useful than happening to own a few bit coins or write some code.
What the economics expert doesn't have that is important is a true understanding of the technology, but that isn't as important.
The best reason to believe they might be wrong is that they are frequently wrong.
