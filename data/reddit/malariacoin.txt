slim? ... I'm not betting on bitcoin alone, I'm indexing, I'm betting on the cryptomarket... ur essentially saying that cryptocurrency has a slim chance of coming back? ... u gotta be kidding me... that's asking me if internet is coming back... look, under bitcoin and most crypto is a technology that prevents duplication of records.... if u think that has no value and an app that puts dog ears on ur face is valued at billions, then I need to stop talking to u...
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:01:21
Lols, u have to understand, at levels of what ur pertaining, its the big boys vs another big boys... in order for big boys able to bet, some other big boy must be on the other side of the bet (usually)... so what ur essentially saying, half of the big boys is controlling the market, which is not a strong definition of "full control" 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:54:52
Ur asking essentially asking what moves the market... its supply and demand... but its anyone's guess what affects supply and demand on a short term time frame
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:25:17
I know what u mean, crypto is growing right now, and I believe ur 120% growth... that's what I'm also saying, in 50 days u earned 120%, if go bitconnect, u get 60%... it seems they are shortchanging people's money...

Its basically says, an expected dip in prices but not enough dip to start worrying of a down trend... btw, I'm not saying that btc is not on a bear trend, just explaining what's a "healthy pullback...

Its not odd, that's just normal market behavior.. in this case, markets will usually move to point of high liquidity... buy and sell walls are points of high liquidity

Lol's, did u miss the part about what I said that I just work an hour a day cos trading allowed me to that? ... but if ur thinking TA is 100% of the game, then that's asking too much... an anology id like to share is something similar to counting cards in black jack.. does counting cards may u win all the time? Of course not, but it will tilt ur win % enough to win against the house.. also, TA is prolly just 30% of the game

@_date: 2018-01-22 20:47:30
I agree with what ur saying, but its out of context in this specific situation... when debating about fundamentals, ur talking about long term impacts, thus the best way to reflect that bet is to use long time frames... which is also a timeframe that dampens the effect of volatility...
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:58:17
.. and if the scaliblity gets fixed? it becomes a good currency... guess where the people will be buying it from and I'm pretty sure they are not selling at the price is bought... early adopters take the risk, compensation for the risk is only deserving...
Whatever problem u can come up next... lemme just say, I believe that the idea of bitcoin is an invaluable idea and one that is the most proven at its purpose..hence, any problem in the future will be solved simply because of the economic incentive... 
I'm confident enough with my analysis that I'm willing to put money on it... if ur confident enough that bitcoin is useless, short it...
In the end, we don't know the future...its easy to yap about how "useless" bitcoin is, but unless if ur confident enough to short, ur essentially on the "sidelines", thus stay in the sidelines with ur opinions...

Its as if ur saying u know where the bottom is going to be, how do u know where not on the bottom now? ...I'm an experienced forex trader and I don't recommend timing the markets if u don't know what ur doing... heck, dipped my feet way back in 2009 in the forex markets and I can only get it right 50% - 60% of the time

no, I was just stating why fifo was initiated... sorry, but I have no experience with such as my country does not impose such rulings... it only ticked me off as when they introduced the ruling, it made my life as a forex trader harder (my broker was from the US)

IMO, hedge funds should be raving about cryptos... a new asset class that's uncorrelated with established and traditional asset classes should be promoted rather than burnt... at the very least, cryptos can be used for diversification purposes...

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:31:12
I don't speak for everyone, but I think most people who understand the tech hodl because its suppose the base currency that we should be using... its a paradigm shift... the endgame is u hodl bitcoin and only use fiat if the othr party is not accepting bitcoin... in this paradigm, "cashing out" has a different meaning... but that's how I look at things, and I could be wrong on assuming that what veteran hodlers are doing...

fifo rulings were imposed mainly for currency trading... it prevents "hedging" (holding long and short positions at the same time)... its a stupid ruling btw as its easily circumnavigated

U really need a lot of money to manipulate huge swings.. and when w have that kind of money, u need someone on the other side to absorb ur bets as u may absorb all the orders from the little guys and still unable to fill ure entire orders.... its a risky game for big boys, just like the little guys..  big boys and little guys has its own set of problem, saying that big boys have it easier is a bit overblown...

This is the thing I'm trying to get at...

I'm actually all in also, but it's a calculated risk... if I lose, I won't go hungry or lose my house or anything, itll be life as if nothing changed except less spare money... but I do agree, I'm not a bitcoin maximalist, I'm open to the idea bitcoin might fall, but saying cryptomarkets will go away,that's just nonsense talk :) ... btw, I dipped my feet in the forex markets since 2009, now living off from trading and getting married on one trade is very dangerous

not here to argue with u...we trade what we believe in..  as for me, dipped my feet in forex since 2009, now also trading cryptos...trading and technical analysis allowed me to just work an hour a day... but if I might add... do u really believe it doesn't work, or ur givng urself an excuse not to learn in? ... no need to answer that for me, its a question on urself.e.

Forex and crypto trader here... can confirm, this usually happens if are new and u think more is better... through the years, I learned that this is just a probabilities game, and no one exactly knows what's going to happen next...  also, in time, i realize that TA is not going to help u predict the market... its purpose is to look for spots in the market that will give u good risk reward ratio, and that means money management.. and yes, money management, position sizing and risk evaluation is more important technical analysis...  I even think that a random entry with good risk reward ratio,money mgt and discipline can make money in the long run.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:26
I'm just tired of hearing about "ohhh... the fees will kill it"... there are already people trying to fix that.. at this point, putting money on bitcoin is like betting on the fact that the scaling problem will be fixed... so again, can bitcoin scaling problem be fixed? If u believe so, then buy or hodl... 
and shut it with altcoins with better technology and "infinite scaling" ... while I do believe there's coins that have better technology, but it seems u give little importance about first mover's advantage... "but myspace.. facebook.. blah blah blah... yes! It happens sometimes, but those kinds of takeovers are not the norm...so I ask, u wanna bet against the house?  .. and if ur really "scared"...hedge bets, I do it...
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:23:10
I see people having different levels of confidence... if ur confident enough, ull put money into it... after all, if we make a bet and u say "if I drop this ball, it will hit the ground"... ud prolly bet a million dollars cos ur very confident of the outcome...
SO, if ur an "anti-bitcoiner" and ur not shorting bitcoin, then I take it ur not confident enough on ur analysis to put money behind it..  so I don't bother debating to people who they themselves are not sure about their position... after all, if bitcoin's failure is guaranteed, who doesn't want guaranteed money?

This is one of the reasons why I think the crypto market is going to grow rapidly in the near future... the average joe in emerging markets have little or expensive investment options... with little required capital and no need for bank or govt authorization, cryptos serve a huge market that traditional investment firms (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) have no interest in serving...

@_date: 2018-01-18 19:08:13
That's why I suggest if people buy bitcoin, forget about it for 6 months... checking the price constantly would only cause anxiety or euphoria, both are bad in trading... always remember "high" is relative... at one point 1k$ was considered high

who in the right mind would buy usdt and hold it for long periods of time as opposed to just holding usd? ...usdt is mainly used for intra day and swing traders as a way to stay away from a falling bitcoin in sites that don't hold US dollars for legal reasons (binance, kucoin)

Good, then I can communicate with u better... Same here, started with forex since 2009.. so lets talk in timeframes u understand... since ur talking about fundamental factors, let talk in terms of years...  I'm on buy and hold position with holding period of years (in this particular trade)... so, u sell and hold for years... and lets talk.. otherwise, ur not that confident with ur anlysis to put money where ur mouth is... and that's what we do right in trading right?

Imo, tangible assets are becoming overrated in this day and age... for a long time, I was super convinced that property is the ultimate asset... but now, I'm starting to see it as "cumbersome" ... what if the country in which ur property resides fucks up? U can't pack up and move ur property to a different country... yeah, u can sell it,but property is illiquid... u wanna sell fast? prepare for deep discounts on ur part...
 
Intangible assets are lighter... heck buying treasury bonds (for cashlflow purposes) from the top 5 countries seems less risky to me than investing in rental property...

@_date: 2018-01-24 10:07:51
U sure about that? ...the way I see it, when they "print money" they are diluting the current value that's in the market... it can be thought as taking from the current value that's in the market and "transfer" it to the newly printed money and give it to the bankers so they can loan it out.... last time I checked, banks are mostly private companies and not "public assets."

I'm not from the US bro, philippines actually... was fascinated with stocks, bonds, real estate and trading since I was in early 20's (now 36)... gulped every book I could get my hands on... grinded my ass on the charts for nearly a year full time before I was seeing profits... funny thing, I completed a nursing course hahahahaha.. never used it, now living off from trading... 
I have one post titled, "my go to advice for new crypto investors" ... please search check it out, I discussed how to do "indexing" and its implication... u might find it useful... 
btw, I didn't invent indexing... its a strategy that even warren buffet advises, which I agree despite him yappng against crypto...

As I said, NOBODY IS FORCING US TO USE BITCOIN! indi ka ba ka intindi nyan?  ... if u ask me, I see the future use of bitcoin and its backed by solid fundamentals... I see it ull be using it in a couple of years... when that time comes, guess who u'll be buying it from... and take a guess how much ull be paying for it... again, if u want money transfer, do paypal or moneygram...

That really depends on ur strategy, if ur playing a sort of buying during small cap and hoping to catch the next ether.. that takes a lot of work... the bigger the cap, the safer it get, but the rewards also goes lower (generally)... find ur sweet spot.. amount of willing to spend on research vs potential gains...
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:07:07
It's called a gap... u see those flat "bars" before the gap... it tells u the gdax market is having an "illiquid" market (low volume) at that specific time... when low volume happens, weird and jerky price movements are to be expected
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:22:00
But that doesn't so evil, hahahaaha... joking aside, yeah a new stock issuance is closer... but the point is there, when u issue a new stock, ur essentially transferring the value that's in the market and transferring it to the new stocks...

@_date: 2018-01-18 10:18:37
my advice for newcomers, buy bitcoin and don't look at the price and/or ignore bitcoin news for at least 6 months... if u wanna be "safer" buy the top 3 of crypto and rebalance every 6 months while, again, not minding the news/price until rebalancing
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:08:05
ur still in the paradigm of thinking bitcoin as a speculative tool that u will need to "cash out" in the future... most hodlers here are holding until full adoption and everyone starts accepting bitcoin... in other words, they don't need to "value"  btc just as u don't need to value ur 1$ as u know that it will be 1$ tomz or next year... 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:26:25
As I recommend, just do indexing (buy the top 3, 5 or 10), rebalance and don't bother with stop losses... I'm a forex trader, which means I'm heavily leveraged on those markets and working with a stop loss is a must...but in crypto and if ur unleveraged, if ur strategy is buy and hold, that means no stop losses... stop losses are for traders, buy and hold are for investors (or classified as long term traders)...
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:50:11
IMO ratings like this are idiotic... look, if u can't trade or do research on ur own, then do an investment strategy that's safer and doesn't rely on "rooting" for a specific coin. A good example is an indexing strategy... relying on someone else judgement in this context will open u up for price manipulation and ull be on the bad end of the stick...
Btw, 2009 mortgage crisis was partially caused by "reputable raters" giving highest ratings to crap bonds... and a lot of people believed them which led to the buying of crap bonds in droves...

They can profit a falling bitcoin by short selling or "shorting"... there a lot of avenues to short bitcoin, some crypto exchanges offer it, futures market, but forex brokers (most offer a btc/usd) are the easiest ones as its easy to open and most have very low minimum requirements to open an account (0 - 500$)

What I mean with working cap is the amount of money u need so u can have growth with enough diversification.. our stock market has a minimum order of 40$... so if u wanna diversify to 10 stocks, u need 400$.. in cryptos, the minimum is 10-15$? the same strategy just needs 150$ at best...

I'm not going to argue about property value as I agree it will always have value... but saying "willing to pay for btc", well, this is an assumption that btc will remain speculative and not morph into a form of currency... if ur wrong on that assumption, then that statement becomes invalid...
U can say that real estate is safer as its already "proven"... I will agree on that, but "proven" will also means less reward...at this point in my life, I'm more focused on growth... when I can amass enough cap, I might heavily start allocating on stability, hence bonds, dividend-paying stock and income property... 
Different assets have different uses... use them accordingly...

I agree completely, I've worked in marketing and also a bit of a techy. The problem with most techies is they think that the best technology will always win, which isn't always true... I'm not saying bitcoin will fail btw...

I'm not worried by tether as its mainly used for intraday trader and swing traders (essentially for protection against falling btc price)  for websites that don't hold actual us dollars... if u u want to cashout ur just USDT &gt; Bitcoin &gt; tranfer to an exchange that trades bitcoin to actual USD ...
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:44:15
If u understand the tech and implications, selling before full adoption is kinda stupid.. even then, by the time of full adoption..."cashing out" will have a very different meaning...

My argument is basically - saying "before I take u seriously, lets be on even grounds... I got money behind my analysis, put money behind ur anti-bitcoin analysis also"

Which essentially dilutes the value that's already in the market.. a stock split also dilutes the value that's already in the market but u don't complain cos ur still getting the same value cos u have two stocks per say... when the money is printed, the value that's in the market is essentially split (not necessarily by half), and the central banks transfer that value to the newly printed money...

Just to let u know, such events may cause a spike, but its anyone's guess if it spikes up or down... this is often referred to news trading, while u can make money out of it, but its not something as "risk-free"...so I'm not saying "no", just be careful....

dude, u can create money but u can't create value by merely printing money... 
Imagine if u and I have 10 stocks valued 1$ each (so u have 10$ wort of stocks), the total value in the market is 20$... now I secretly printed 10 more stocks.. now the market has 30 stocks in total, but the value within the market does not change... as I said, u can't create value by printing money or stock..
Now the market naturally adjust to reflect the value of ur stock... again, there are 30 stocks with total market value of 20$.. now each stock adjusts to .66$ each rather than original 1$ each... ur holdings went from 10$ to 6$ at the same time increasing my holdings 14$ because I have the "authority" to print money.. 
now tell me, AM I NOT STEALING FROM U UNDER UR NOSE?

ur concerns are valid, and I wouldn't try turn u against ur analysis...  however, If I may, u could try an indexing strategy as it may circumnavigate ur concerns.. mind u, indexing is already a know strategy in stocks and not my invention...
With indexing, if u say u choose to do top 10...u divide ur money and going to buy the top 10 cap of cryptos... u "update" ur holdings regularly (like monthly)... with this strategy, ur not betting on one particular coin, but rather ur betting that the entire crypto market grows. As I always say, there's a slim chance that bitcoin may fall, but saying cryptos is going away, well that's just nonsense talk...

With indexing, u start, lest say with 100$ and u buy the top 10...if u choose to do equal weight, then that means 10$ for each coin... 
The thing is, as time moves forward, some of those coin will drop out of the top 10, some will be worth 30$ and some will be worth 5$... 
Rebalancing is like resetting... u liquidate all ur position, then buy the top 10 again at 10% allocation... so if ur money has grow to 200$, then each coin must have 20$ worth... 
Rinse and repeat depending on ur arbitrary time interval, but the key point is being displined in doing..  so if u wanna do it monthly and on the first day of the month, keep it that way.. in between forget about ur portfolio

If were gonna bring in technical stuff here, then my take is that the recent dip to 9k may be the completion of the abcd cycle, in which point A was the 20k high... not only that, the market just showed the bullish gartley 222 pattern (good reliability pattern).... fundamentalwise, lightning may get real world adoption by midyear... all in all... this may be the bottom or, it will flat until lightning... I'm not so keen on the price going lower as I'm seeing tall rejection tails on the daily timeframe...

While I love the idea of bitcoin going to 1m, but the longer u wait the least impact it will have on ur investment... think about it, if u bought at 500k, 1m is just double.. hence, from 500k to 1m, ur money just doubles... still better than most investments.. but u can forget about lambos with 100$ initial investments...

What ur saying have merits, but if u want to get  bitcoin when technologies are already built to make it faster, safer and secure, that's up to u... but I can guarantee u, the price will be much higher than today... early adopters take more risk, thus the reward is higher gains... 
Also, let's step back a bit... who really needs money protection here, u or the rich? ... remember, ur money in the bank is insured by the central bank at a certain point... in our place the insurance is roughly $4,000 ... now I ask u, if I have $100,000k, and my insurance is only $4,000... would u put ur money on a bank where it can be frozen or manipulated? Or u want it on a system that's nearly unkillable, censor-resistant and can be private...  so who really needs protection here?

Stop loss: I don't have one... I've studied the tech and implication... for me, its a matter of "when" not "if"...

In economic theory... there's the "efficient value" and there's a "perception value", so when the perception value (in this case, caused by hype) increases way off from its efficient value, its the time when the market needs to correct back to its efficient value, thus the term correction... btw, I'm just explaining why they use the term correction...so please don't debate me on any of the specifics... also, depending on who u ask, correction, crash, bubble have different meanings

I'm prolly going to get downvoted for this... but my suggestion to newcomers is to buy the top 3 (except bcash, it's fundamentally flawed and it doesn't have its own niche)... 
To break it down for you:
Buying only bitcoin means ur betting on bitcoin will remain king of cryptos to the end...
Buying the top 3 (and continually rebalance) means ur starting to be in the realms of betting that crypto has a bright future... 
So its up to u and ur risk tolerance... also, don't attempt to time the market is u don't know what ur doing... I'm an experienced forex trader and I can only get it 50% - 60% right...

There's no such thing as a short squeeze in forex for retail investor as forex is just/similar to a "contract of difference", a derivative just like options... 
also, I'm not sure if ur "rich" enough to be worried by short squeezes... to be short squeezed, u need to "borrow" huge amounts of stocks, but the price goes against u, and the market doesn't have enough stocks supply that u can buy to cover ur short position... its a problem for institutional traders not traders in which ur position is relatively miniscule...
Margin calls? Then do a 1:1 leverage... no margin calls for u...
What other excuses u may have? Or, u can simply state... I have a feeling that bitcoin may fall in the long run, but I'm not confident enough to put money on it.. which brings me to my original position...
If ur not that confident enough to put money on ur long term bitcoin analysis, then ill take ur anti bitcoin arguements as "weak" and I shouldn't be debating with u...after all, if bitcoin's failure is guaranteed, then ur sayng u don't want guaranteed money?

"high" is a relative term... I think its a sound approach to compare bitcoin to a similar commodity and estimate its potential market from there... as of the moment, bitcoin may be similar to gold, and gold is in the cap of trillions.. bitcoin is still at billions... from that, its a good guesstimate that even at the price of 20k, it is still "low"... this is still a conservative guesstimate as bitcoin is prolly better than gold...

As a trader for years, heres the way I see it: 
In the timeframe of years: very bullish... the longer the timeframe, the more fundamental reasons will kick in. Bitcoin's fundamentals are near-impenetrable. The honey badger is beautifully designed to gain value... 
In the timeframe of weeks: flat or bullish... bitcoin is displaying a strong bullish pattern one the daily timeframe, which is the gartley 222. Also, on daily time frame, there are long price rejections on the bear side (markets are rejecting the low prices)... add the fundamental keypoint that lightning is growing... I'm confident that at best, we will have a strong bull push...if that's not going to happen, a flat market may happen until lightning network explodes...
I'm not too keen on bitcoin dipping even more as the bears are experiencing a lot of price rejections on daily tf even from the move from 20k high point. (in the daily timeframe, observe the long tails on the bottom side... long tails on the up side is nearly non existent)
Now I am not saying it won't reach 1k, as nobody knows the future truly... but the % of that happening is prolly 30% at best when I look at the short-term technical and fundamental data...
Tip: stop looking at time frames below 1 day... this is not the stock markets. Every country has its own "sentiment" or "mood". oftentimes, when major market time overlaps, this creates a diluted mood of the markets, which is not good...daily timeframes will already take into account the mood of the major markets in a single bar... ull have a better information working with those... 
Even though I'm a trader, ill tell u right now that TA is not a crystal ball... its just a tool to help u tilt ur hit rate in ur favor... also, trading is not just about technical and fundamental analysis... if ur an emotional trader, not even a crystal ball can help in preventing u from pressing that sell button...

idk how ur stock market works, but u can't buy 1 share in our stocks market..  it has to be in lots... unless u are talking about "bucket shops" which is essentially u are betting on a stock rather that owning the stock...
Even having said that, with cryptos, u don't have to wait for a year, u can diversify way earlier... 
 I have forex, cryptos and planning to diversify in stocks..  the reason I'm not into stocks yet is 1) cryptos is a new global asset class and my analysis it will suck in more capital thus outperforming any stock market in the near future 2) to implement my strategy, I rougly need $20,000 in stocks ... but in cryptos the same strategy is workable with $1,000.

I'm willing to pay for advanced features as I badly need such and I track more that 30+ coins at any given time...

30% per month.. u need simply need to ask urself what are they doing that they can afford to give u that kind of returns and still remain sustainable... a trading bot? 
I ask again, if u have a trading bot that can make millions, would u hassle urself with a business (marketing, customer support and legal), or sip a cocktail on a beach a watch the money roll in? 
Hint: trader here for years, haven't seen a commercial bot that can make money consistently, let alone guarantee 30% roi per month...

That's ur analysis, not mine... big boys know about the lightning, and position accordingly...u think the big boys buy bitcoin when lighting is already fully implemented? I think some are already loading up anticipating the move that will be brought by lightning... their buying action will form a floor in the market, and at the same time reduce the market supply... but I agree, effects of lightning won't be seen for months for general bitcoin users... 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:43:47
IMO, short squeeze are broadcasted by people who doesn't understand short squeeze and simply don't want u to short... short squeeze is a problem for big boys because of their huge orders... the danger is when u have a short position, the price goes against u and u want to close ur position.. but because of ur huge position, the market has no enough supply u can buy to close ur huge position, which puts u in a losing position that u can't close... 
Another short squeeze problem is when the "borrowed" stock u used for shorting gets "used" by the stock owner, then ull be forced to close ur short position at a loss, or forced to borrow from a different stocks owner but there's no one willing to lend u the stock, which means carrying a floating loss u can't close immediately.
Retail traders doesn't have these problem because of the relatively miniscule positions...
Margin calls? Don't trade with margin, that solves the problem...
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:18:54
Also, "value" is not dependent on what u want it.. I see iphones are overpriced... guess what? Someone is paying for it so that's it value... lesson  in value: if someone is willing to pay for it, then that's its value period... the market does not care about ur opinion...
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:14:09
I mean seriously, this should be obvious... in my country, u need roughly $20,000 (converted) to have a working capital in our stock markets... with cryptos, u capital of $1,000 is very workable...  
In other words, its waaaaay easier to start in cryptos than stocks...
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:21:15
While the scenario is true, but bottom line, were talking about the future here... something that nobody knows exactly... I trust my analysis is correct, and I'm confident enough to put money on it... time will tell if ill be handsomely paid or not... u can wait for bitcoin to be better and more convenient, but at that time, guess who'll be buying bitcoin from, and I certainly won't sell it at the price I bought it...
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:24:30

Okay, "give" is not the exact term... but if ur a bank that puts in 100$ in central banks, they print money and give u $200 - $1000 per 100$ (depending on the kind of central bank) and loan that money with hefty interest... 
Where do banks get money to "deposit" in central banks? Ur money that u deposited rn banks.
Where do the central bank get the value to "support" the newly printed mone? From the existing value that's already in the market.
How much the bank will give u for this travesty? 1% a year if ur lucky!
So go ahead, believe what they are telling u that its for "stimulating" the economy all the while making themselves ridiculously rich
"Here, take that 1% while I use YOUR MONEY and the value thats already in the market (that I took out with no permisso) to make myself filthy rich" - the bank

Market manipulation becomes less severe as the volume goes up... its the reason why bitcoin volatility is going down because more and more money is coming in...but what do I know, where talking about the future hero...
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:31:15
Cos there'll always govt trying to get ahead... IMO, govt that welcome cryptos will only get ahead from anti-crypto govt... so even if a nation proposes an all govt ban, therell be govt wouldn't agree as they see it as a ticket to get ahead...
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:08:20
The way I see it, our confidence comes in levels... there's a point in ur confidence level in which ur willing to put money behind it... imo, of ur not willing to put money on it, then ur not confident enough so why am I entertaining ur unsure anti-bitcoin stance...after all, if we can make a bet right now and ur bet says "when I release this ball, it will hit the ground", ud prolly bet a million dollars and even borrow money for the bet cos ur confidence level is so high...
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:22:49

I don't know exactly, but $50,000 is just way off IMO... were barely at 10%  adoption, at the very best 20%...we have a long way to go in the adoption chart and I feel $50,000k is just too low... even comparing to gold, a similar commodity, its at trillions cap.. bitcoin is just 300b?... plus, bitcoin can be argued as way better than gold... also, when the scalibility problem is fixed, bitcoin becomes a currency + store of value as opposed as gold that its mainly used as a store of value... so even saying that bitcoin can reach gold's cap is a conservative statement
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:49:54
Good for you... anyway, we trade what we believe in... if u don't believe in cryptos, I certainly won't try to convince u... btw, I'm not from a first world country, it takes me smaller capital to live off from trading... just need roughly 400$ a month to cover everything...

This! It's a reason that I don't pay too much "weight" on buy walls or sell walls... I'm not saying its not important as its information after all, I just don't really on it too much... big boys can make orders to create the "walls" to scare or attract fishes...
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:34:26
I swing trade bitcoin and I use tether to "park" the money outside bitcoin.. sites like kucoin and binance don't hold US dollars.. so if u trade in their sites, how can u shield from the dropping bitcoin if not without us tether... 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't use the tether if u plan on holding dollars for a long time... that's not what its for. Its mainly used for day traders on sites that don't hold US dollars.

I seee the government as a big sink drain as efficiency is not the goal... in free market enterprise, the less people u pay and the more u produce, the more u are applauded... in govt, the more people u control under u, the more u can spend, the more u are applauded... 
But then again, govt were not designed to be a free market enterprise...but I also lean towards small govt... on top of that, govt has no system in place to keep it from bloating too big, which becomes an increasing strain for the public... I just see govt as "necessary evil" if u may...

To avoid confusion, "value" is simply determined if someone is willing pay for it.. coins have their features... and how much value the features carry? Well, that's determined if how much someone is willing to pay for it...

@_date: 2018-01-23 12:13:16
One factor that also needs to be considered is time... if ur 60 years old, investing in crypto is risky as it may dip and u may die before seeing profits... if however u still have the long way to go, like 5 - 10 years at least, then worrying about intra-year dips is mostly unfounded...
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:09:16

There are exchanges that don't hold US dollars for legal reasons.

This is why there's no such thing as a one-size fits all in personal finance... in ur case, it seems that u should be more focused on growth vs stability... if u think u don't need growth that much, then start allocating to stable cashflow producing asset like bonds or property rentals... in investment world, stability and growth are usually on the opposite sides, u can't have both extremes unless u want to fall for scams like bitconnect... try to find the right balance for u in the stability vs growth spectrum

Oh yeah, cos I'm trying to find a way to better explain it to people how money printing works...
Also, you can be anyone in the internet... I'm the president too.. 
So let me get this straight, u claim to have a finance degree, and u don't know how banks and loans might work on bitcoin? ...
We should be askng u, not asking random people on a reddit sub among all other places... geesh...
Did I say banks and loans won't work on bitcoin? Geeeeshh... 
That's twice already u misunderstood and/or placed words in my mouth...
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:25:31
Lols, that's what central banks essentially do... where do u think the money of the "quantitative easing" went? 
Look, I've been there before.. "ohhh the deflationary currency is the best thing ever, bitcoin ruleeeesss, yeaaah!"
Until I realized both deflationary and inflationary has its own pros and cons... 
Deflationary is stable, but slow
Inflatianory has speed but risky
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:08:19
Ill give u a neutral view...
Deflation has the advantage of being stable.. but stability will also mean giving up speed...
Inflation, IF done right, has the advantage of speed (printing money to further speed up economic growth).. but it comes at the price of stability, like it collapses, crashes or hyperinflate..
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:40:37
Dude, u believe what u wanna believe... I like my unbiased position as it gives me clarity... 
and I'm not arguing from a position of pro-fiat, but rather from someone who's in the middle, knowing the pros and cons of the two currency models...
If u wanna convince me to ur "religion", ull have more chance with the bitcoin maximalist. They seem to be fond of taking sides to everything...

The stats is meaningless at worst, and inaccurate at best...
A big portion of today's bitcoin are produced during the very early days... and most of the owners lost access to btc wallets.. hence, a big portion of that is not "owned" rather "lost"...

What ur talking about is more of wallet hacking...
But convincing someone to give me his/her bitcoin to join a ponzi scheme is still fraud, but its his stupidity causing the problem...
And u can't really completely eliminate stupidity...which is why I believe, paypal and credit cards will still exist, but bitcoin likely eat a big portion of their cake... 
Also, there are instances its preferable to work with paypal... also as a freelancer, paying for subcontracting service is best done through paypal in case the other party doesn't deliver

Paragraph  have u been trading for years in currency exchange that deals with banks and real-life economies ? If no, then I'm smarter than u in this specific subject... u prolly play video games, right? Then ur smarter than me on that subject cos I don't play that much.. don't get offended, its the way it is... 
Paragraph  ... the basis of my statement is true, didn't say its not worth discussing.. just pointing out that this is a highly speculative endeavour, and putting too much brain power on this inefficient for me (I got other things to focus on).
Paragraph  u want substantial proof? Based on what exactly, given this is entirely a new thing?...
Correct me if I'm wrong, I think I'm understanding that bank loans won't work on bitcoin as its a currency that goes up in value, so banks just hold it rather than loaning it.. 
The benefits of loaning is ur locking-in ur profits no matter if bitcoin goes up or down in the future... that's an incentive for banks, especially for them that they are more interested on being "safe" rather than mooning gains.. 
Also,just because deflationary predicts the value will go up, it won't be on a straight year to year up... years of ups and downs are to be expected (but gaining if u start averaging)...
.. and we are assuming deflationary will work like that, given we got little history to work on...
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:53:38
Bottom line:
If you believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin.. stop looking at the price at the moment... check back the price in 3-5 years... warren buffet is a fundamental investor and he buys and wishes the markets closes for the next 5 years...
If ur a trader, the daily timeframe trend was far from being "bull" as the resistance line that would turn it to bull was at around 8.5k... at least that's how I see it...

Bitmex is fine... I trade there... Just don't use leverage.. It's the leverage that will get you killed with the spikes and swings... even if the "orchestrated" spike was true, it shouldnt wipe your account.. and if you're trading well, you're wins should be able to cover the losses of the spikes and more... and in time you'll learn that no market is "immune" to such spikes...
The only issue of Bitmex is, can you trust them? Well, I trust binance more than bitmex... but i'm spreading my money to reduce risk...

To have a better understanding, think of commodity, currency or whatever having a "feature"... that's what's backing everything... 
From this feature.. supply and demand then kicks in to find the "fair market" value of the feature.. 
USD has a feature that its supported by the pledge of the US govt... 
Gold has a "store of value" feature and industrial use feature...
Bitcoin has the feature of a virtually "immutable ledger"... maybe this feature doesn't sound glamorous, but if u really think about it u own ur car or house cos there's a ledger in the government that says so... if that ledger gets altered or manipulated, u will then lose ownership of ur car or house...

"its okay if u don't know a certain subject, but being vocal about ur opinions on a subject u don't know is plain wrong"

That's the problem with maximalism... it runs on the same thought process with religion... oftentimes, jumping speculation to "facts"
And stop preaching to me, I'm a bitcoin supporter.. I know all about its implications... but I'm not a maximalist,  its just as stupid idea.. 
Even science has one pillar that states...
"I could be wrong"
Maximalist doesn't have that, thus its more of a religion than critical thinking.. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:33:54
These days, accumulating knowledge is seemed to be equated with critical thinking... 
in this sub alone, the naysayers are good at pointing out the flaws of bitcoin, but when I ask them in a scale of 1 - 10, how confident that ur speculation will come to pass...
This is the point that most will start evading answering.. cos the reality is, they just accumulate information against bitcoin without context... u start asking questions that require critical thinking, it will "malfunction" their brain... some can't even differentiate a fact from speculation... jesus...
Just like religion...

By that logic, if I would be shilling, don't u think my employer would provide me with such credible accounts since, like u, seem to ignore points and run on the basis of older accounts = more credibility?
But I guess I'm with a poor employer lols...

First of all, I'm also betting on bitcoin and I don't put money when I'm not confident... 
That the part I don't agree is bitcoin = cryptocurrency market... bitcoin is a coin... cryptocurrency is an entire maket... 
To me, again, to me... saying if bitcoin will fail, the entire cryptomarket will also collapse is like saying... if apple fails the stock market will collapse...
BUT in the end... we have little history to work with, thus our predictive modeling capibilities are severely limited...
In other words, I could be wrong and u could be right..  the only difference is..  I accept I might be wrong, but I'm getting the impression ur 100% right (which is odd cos there's little history to work with that can support ur stance)...

Been trading for years... my advice? Don't do it...
1) diminishing returns problem - if u swing trade (hold positions in days and weeks), u may get a 20% roi per say..  if ur very good at day trading, u may get 30% roi, but the work and stress that comes along with it drastically increases... 
For example, swing trading gets u 20% roi, ur stress would be at 50% per say... day trading gets u 30% roi, but its likely ur stress will jump to 200%... 
2) manipulation problem - it takes significantly lesser volume to move the price 1% when compared to 10%...  thus, manipulators can easily knock u out if ur stop loss is 1% away compared to its 10% away from the current price.
And in trading, the shorter the timeframe, the closer ur stop loss is (generally)
3) fees - more trading = more fees that its becomes to start cutting through ur profits, which then impacts ur hit rate... 
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:38:54

If cryptocurrency fails, its only because bitcoin failed?

I personally trade at bitmex... I'm not going to tout them as divinely good as there are practices that I also find "trappy".. 
The biggest is perhaps the leverage option.. as the more leverage you use, the more ull gonna get wiped because of the fee structure.. 
Having said that, if u just stay away from leverage, they are a good place to trade especially if u do limit orders, which the platforms even pay you and not the other way around... its a feature that is near nonexistent in forex and even in stocks... 
So all in all, they have a good system if u know what ur doing...
Also staying away from short time frames is always a generally good advice...

Dude, its obvious u got money on bitcoin... 
And when we have money on something, we tend to get anxiety about it, especially during this time...
But hey, if this belief u created is what works for to stave off that anxiety, by all means go...
I'm just out, its hard to talk to someone when the lines are blurry from my perspective... like for example, one redditor I debated seems to think that...
"sun will rise tomorrow" is a fact, when in fact its a prediction cos it hasn't happened yet... 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:33:58
I'm not really concerned about ur getting it more right than wrong thing..  I'm also a trader...
I'm just making a statement that claiming cryptocurrency won't succeed as currency is a very speculative statement, especially given that we have little history on such kind of medium to try to predict a future outcome...
Of course u can make up reasons, but bottom line is that we have little history that trying to forecast is a highly speculative business...

Who in the right mind would short bitcoin in the long run... historically, its going up... likely, its gonna go úp...

@_date: 2018-09-16 18:24:51
I'm a big supporter of bitcoin (check my history if u don't believe me)... but saying bitcoin CANNOT be replaced is something very very speculative...
Of course ur reasons have merit, which I agree btw... but it won't change the fact the bitcoin and crypto is an entirely new thing... we have little history to work with...
.. and since we largely make predictions based on past behaviors, then it means our predictions are only as good as our historical data, which is very little...
Thus, predicting bitcoin behavior is very very speculative whether its a good predition or bad prediction...

So its like this... are u really sure its going to be rising in the next 5 years? (it could drop 5% in the next 5 years, and rise 10% for the next 5 to close the decade with a 5% gain)
Giving a loan allows u to "lock-in" ur gains for the next 5 or whatever years... that's a good incentive if ur goal is "security" and not "mooning"
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:53:37
Lols, bitcoin dominance..  cryptocurrency is an emerging market with coins having different usecases (including ones u haven't thought of) as it matures u can expect bitcoin's "dominance" to drop...
More coins = more dilution = lower dominance
Formula for cap is terribly inaccurate for illiquid coins. Those are the same coins that been taken into account when calculating "bitcoin dominance." 
Inaccurate numbers lead to inaccurate results. 
Thus, bitcoin dominance is near useless metric...

My analysis... the 8.5K rally was easier to spot... pattern went from 12k then to 10k so 8 was the likely turning point (if it indeed turn, assuming u started ur analysis at 5k-6k)
The next turning point is 6k if the progression continues.. but that's too close to the likely floor of 5k - 6k...
So yeah, that pattern progression is likely over... I'm not saying itll be a bull market to 20k or something, just pointing out the previous pattern progression is likely over...
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:58:14

@_date: 2018-09-18 17:38:35
As what I've observed trading the daily and 4-hour, any bitcoin bull rally without the backing of at least the top 10 in cap is usually a bull trap

what you're saying is "no one is using it the way I want it to be used"...

@_date: 2018-09-09 04:33:28
Typically, these kinds of situations gets normalized through arbitrage traders... 
But in instances like this, it's not that easy...
For example.. u buy bitcoin in the states for $6k.. u got to the country and sell it for $20k but in local currency...
So u think u have profited $14k, but here's ur problem.. ur holding the local currency, and if ull have problems converting that to us dollars (due to sanctions or restrictions), ull never see that profit materialize...
If only a few arbritrage traders can successfully do this, it creates an "inefficiency" in the markets, thus causing disparity in the prices...
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:58:23
Paragraph 1 - Another possibilty.. bitcoin fails, and another better version comes along... or, another version comes along that overtakes and kills bitcoin...
now ur possibilities have split into three... ur statement is now a PREDICTION that people will choose that route instead of the other one.. 
Paragraph 2 - if u say cryptocurrency concept will fail, then that's an entrily different stance as bitcoin and cryptocurrency are two different things... there's a possibility that bitcoin tanks, but crypto thrives for numerous reasons including the ones we haven't thought off...
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:53:06
oh its not a dick swinging contest.. its proof that it can be done, and that's something u don't want to admit... cos idk? Its a lot easier to say "it can't be done" vs spending time and effort to learn it...

Dude, another coin can be produced with a cap like bitcoin... bitcoin doesn't have an exclusivity to that feature...
So ure donna drag this to why other coins with same feature will fail? 
And now were' back again at predicting with little history to support ur or my stance...
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:56:29
Again bro, I find it really odd that ur version of the future truth is placed at 100% certainty when u have little history to prove that...
Also, I did say that's how I see it... and I specifically stated that I could be wrong cos I acknowledge the fact that I have little history to work with...
But let's step back one bit here... are u one of those people who can't differentiate between a prediction and fact?
There's plenty of them running around in this sub, both anti and pro bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:15:26
As I said, most of ur points I agree... but saying it "cannot" be replaced, indicates that's 100% certainty it cannot be replaced..  
And that's what I'm pointing out.. how come u have 100% certainty, when we have little history to work with... 
in other words, ur 100% certainty is MOSTLY based on ur logical assumptions, which the market has no obligation to agree with u...
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:15:29
Oh yeah... fiat is far from perfect. In fact, I think it good on paper, but tends to fuck up in real life due to greed and corruption. 
Having said that, if its done right, it can outgrow bitcoin's growth...but that comes with a big IF...
In my opinion, fiat and bitcoin will coexist...
 bitcoin will serve as a "police" for central banks in a way that they can't carry too much risk in exchange for growth (before bitcoin, they can just carry out risky maneuvers and dump it on the people when it fails)... otherwise, people can simply move out via bitcoin.
On the other hand, fiat can outgrow bitcoin due to the increased risk, which makes it also enticing
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:13:41
Did I accuse u? Is asking the same with accusing?
So collecting interest rate payments from the loan u gave IS NOT locking in gains while maintaining the ownership of the asset?
Selling bitcoin is also gains, but that's also means u don't own it anymore.. 
Both serve a different purpose... 
u wanna do a fact check? Cos I'm really doubting ur finance degree claim.. I can give u link right now to prove I've been trading forex for years.. can u give something similar?
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:51:58
To be fair, paypal and major credit cards can reverse a fraud transaction... in an even of a fraud, somebody is going to lose something (e.g., if the product has already been delivered, the money has been converted to cash...
Hence, paypal and credit cards needs to cover for the loss... thus they charge higher fees...
Before u all start crapping, check my history and ull know I'm a bitcoin supporter...but I'm not illogically biased as I don't belong to the church of bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:20:30
Again bro, most of ur points I agree... 
But..  when u said bitcoin CANT be replaced? ... isn't this a prediction? 
Also, saying if bitcoin fails, then crypto market will also fail? ... isn't this a prediction?
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:45:18
Really depends on what markets u talking about... in stocks, shorters are the police to dishonest company crooks... they investigate if there's something fishy, short and then release the findings... 
In economic theory, what ur looking for is a sustained growth (like a 45 degree upslope)... if the prices climbs too high, it starts becoming unsustainable and might lead to a crash...
Due to the effects of shorters (giving downward pressure), it prevents unsustainable growth episodes, thus preventing crashes...
That's what I learned about the effects of shorters... but I do know that these are more of theories...
Personally, I trade the 4-hour, and I short and long bitcoin regularly... at these levels, u make a mistake, u pay for it... if u wanna short my long position, one of us will be wrong... its just business, not personal...
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:32:30
What ur saying is
If A happens, then B will happen...
But since A and B are in the future, those are still predictions...

maybe ur not seeing it the way I do... I've been trading for years both on forex and more recently in crypto... there are subjects that I assume everyone knows... if u think my initial posts had no connection, then I prolly missed subjects in between that and some topic I assumed u know...
But let's just boil it down to this:
To be honest, no present govt been on a true deflatianory currency..  hence, we lack historical basis, thus predicting how it will behave is an extremely speculative business...
Having said that, u can bet that the finance sector can find a way to make their business model work on top of bitcoin... theyve got the resources to hire the best brains for solving it...

Bro, as I said, I agree most of ur points.. I'm a bitcoin supporter...but u seem to miss my point.. 
We are making a prediction with little history to support our predictions... 
We are talking about  scenarios that will happen in the FUTURE, and that's prediction no matter how u look at it... 
So don't stop convincing urself that ur predictions are facts.. in fact, because we have little history to work with, its more accurate to say "anything could happen" compared to "this is what's going to happen"...

When an inflationary currency prints money, the value of the money will naturally decrease... BUT there is a lag time... in essence there's a window of opportunity..
What fiat can do is divert that newly printed money to economic growth, which then increases the value of the currency IF it succeeds, negating the effects of the devaluation caused by printing plus more...
Now this comes with a BIG IF...  if its done properly and goes according to plan...
Now give that option to a government that are trying to compete with each other, u really think theyd run a car with no nitro when everyone has one?
Novel idea, unlikely to happen..

Oh okay.. 
So let me get this straight... u don't consider interest payments as "locking in gains" cos ur definition is the correct one?

Lols, trading against customers is common,even in forex brokers... just as long the broker don't manipulate the price printing on their platform, its not considered as illegal, and its not even unethical for me...
So if u bet on mcgregor and the bookie bets on mayweather, u consider the bookie as evil?
What's more unethical is customers losing money and blaming the platform.. that's even more common...
@_date: 2018-09-25 02:06:35
Lols, forex is a leveraged market and its doing fine... x100 is even considered as "normal"
the problem with leverage in crypto is in the broker... specifically, like bitmex, the fee structure charges the total amount and not on the collateral... 
Say they charge 1%.. if u put on a collateral of 1$ to buy 100$... bitmex charges you 1% of 100$...
It means ur trading fee is already 100% of ur initial investment... I do know its lesser than 1%, but point stands... leverage and the associated fees will eat through your profits...
Of course, u can use limit orders.. the problem is u could be chasing ur entry and exit just so someone will take ur order... thus, limit orders are not precise, which is a big deal if ur trading small time frames.. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:22:34
Interesting how ur mind thinks.. 
What else u have in mind?
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:28:18
maybe u can understand this better if u look at this way...
For the next 5 years, u don't know what the price will be exactly by the end of that 5 years...
Now you have the options of either holding vs loaning (aside from selling cos maybe u don't like that option)
Case for holding 
* u get 100% of gains, if ur right.. 100% of the loss also if ur wrong 
Case for loaning
* u won't get 100% of the gains if price goes up, but ur locking in a portion of the gains in terms of interest... if price goes down, loaning becomes more profitable vs holding
Hence, loaning now becomes an option if u want to lock-in gains rather than 100% exposure... essentially, mitigating risk and sacrificing potential gains 
Its falls on the very basic subject of risk vs gains... which is why I'm questioning ur so-called finance degree...
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:06:02
Well, there's nothing wrong if commercial banks are "in" it... they are just third party providers that can work on top of fiat or bitcoin...

@_date: 2018-09-26 00:51:14
While I'm a big supporter of bitcoin, fiat just has advantages thah bitcoin will never have... one main example is its ability to "loan" itself to fund economic growth...
And unless every country in the planet agrees to run on bitcoin only, nations will adopt fiat as a means of outgrowing the next nation...
This separation of state and currency is a novel idea, but I doubt it will ever happen...

Also, about the freelancing issue... a smart contract is a futile attempt, IMO... at least at this moment... 
Let's say I want to a writing job... a smart contract will be difficult to use... does the contract execute when he sends me a file? It could be a bogus file.. 
Sends me a file with bunch of words? Could be a copy pasted article... 
 
Point is, there's always someone trying to cheat the settings.. and sometimes u need the creativity of a human brain to provide context, thus deciding if the contract should execute...
 but smart contracts will have a place and I welcome its addition to the ecosystem...

While the pattern is unfolding, it took prolly more than 3 months to form until an actionable pattern appears... for many, the wait is tooo boring...

The process of printing money can be either viewed as:
A. Transferring part of the value from the old supply and transferring it to the new one, which is stealing (while u can print money, u can't magically increase the value in the pool by doing that).
B. The act above can be viewed as a loan as the new money is used to fund the economy, thus when the economy grows, the value lost is then restored plus more.
Basically, the feds do something, and there are two ways to look at it, same as above...
Up to u how u look at it, and how u much u believe what they say...
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:49:35
This is what I said that I discussed subjects that I assume u already know.. what the point of loaning if ur not getting interest mr. Finance degree holder?
Ohhh u wanna discuss terminologies in economics... by whose authority that ur definition is correct..  is there a consensus among economists that says this term is this and this term is that? 
Hint: economy is not yet a science for many (social science at best), and one of the reason for that is economists has barely any consensus on anything...

Mcaffee is a smart guy... he built mcaffee antivirus from the ground up.. correct me of wrong, but he built the software, and not just bought...
In the light of that... which is likely going to be a reason:
A) kill the neighbor the day after mcaffee's dog got poisoned... 
B) the local government got wind of his money, tried to set him up so they can have a reason to freeze his assets or extort a huge payday
...I'm not a fan of mcafee... I see him as a hustler, and that's his hustle...I can respect that... but between the two, ill side with the second answer... killing the neighbor just after my dogs got poisoned is just too obvious if I really wanted to kill him... that's kind of mistake is something a street thug would do, and not a paranoid tech smartass hustler...

but the thing with the markets, a "fair game" to u maybe "unfair" to other parties...
margin and leveraged trading is NOT an unfair practice as it comes with high risk and high reward...
Dude, I get it okay... but this altruistic idea is a hippy's dream in these markets...
Trading is nothing more than "I think this goes up, the other guy thinks its going down"... remember, u can't buy when no one is selling, and no one is going to sell if he thinks its still going up...
That bitcoin you own, it likely came from a guy who believes its not going up anymore...that's why he sold it to u...
Between the two of u, someone has to lose...

Well simplify this.. 
Without adding any new conversation threads...
Our issue was volatility...
So, my question...
Its been proven that bitcoin's volatility is decreasing... but u don't believe the volatility won't be low enough to become currency... 
Is that right? Yes or no...
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:33:24
Keynesian paid shills! This is ur cue! 
Go on and earn ur money!
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:38:07
Theoretically, currency should keep 1$ =1$ worth of buying power... as the economy expands, the demand for the currency will also rise.. this offsets the 1$ = 1$ buying power, making each dollar carry more buying power...
As a way of bringing back that 1 to 1 ratio, the central banks print more money to dilute the buying power making it weaker...
But this is only theoretical as humans can be corrupt and use the control for personal gains... plus, the current system is designed to purposely degrade ur buying power, and they call it "stimulating the economy."
Soooo.. its either that or we cut out human control out of the system and allow the currency to get more valuable as demand increases, and less valuable as the demand decreases...
Point is, with bitcoin, no amount of "asking" will change its price as its at the mercy of supply and demand...

What u want is for people to behave the way you do... 
Leave them be... if they risk 10x, then they ought to be compensated for the risk... nothing wrong with that...
ALL markets are manipulated to a degree and most of the time, its just whales trying to solve a problem... 
remember, large orders of the whales can't be filled by one click of a button... they have liquidity problems.. oftentimes, ur stop loss is just a sell order, which to the eyes of the whale, a solution to their liquidity problem... so yes, they will use their weight to trigger that sell order of urs...
Also, whales can only manipulate to a certain degree. Typically, within or even less than intraday volatility range... and intraday trading shoulnt be done by retail traders in the first place (unless ur a trading rockstar)

I'm pointing out that ur reason is speculation.. 2nd of all, ur assuming that crypto will become store of value...
I'm not saying these are wrong, I'm just saying these are guesstimates... unless u got a crystal ball there tells u the future... 
... As I said, I see bitcoin as the leader cos the markets said so, and I'm not gonna argue with that... 
I'm just pointing out why u think bitcoin is the leader, what's ur source for this belief?
Also, does ur source of belief have a way of telling u that u may be wrong?
Otherwise, were in religion territory here.. "my religion is the right one cos I believe it is, and there's no way it can't be wrong"..

No, cos ur entire point hinges that bitcoin's volatility is the same 5 years ago, which u then u asertain that it does not obey the bigger cap = lesser volalitilty rule...

Dude, u have to understand that money only represents value and buying power... 
Let's say 1$ = 1$ worth of buying power...
While u can double ur money by printing, u can't double the "worth of buying power" by doing that...
Ull essentially end with something like below if u simply double ur money without doubling the buying power behind it...
2$ = 1$ worth of buying power
Itd be a lot easier to think in terms of "currency is just a messenger of value or buying power"...

Dude, u do realize there's "no true definition" here as there's no recognized body that works similar to webster's...
I don't know where u get ur definition, but as I've known, a "short squeeze" is a jargon used by hedge managers when another hedge manager is trying to f*ck them...
Keep in mind that in the league of the big boys, the big chunks of win comes from another big boy losing...
Which is why I said, most short squeezed are just bear traps, which is a term used when bears just liquidate because of natural supply and demand, and not a whale trying to f*ck another whale.. 
But hey, if u wanna stick to ur definition, that's fine... these are all jargons...

Truth is, gold has two prices..

@_date: 2018-08-29 10:42:47
Lols... ur first paragraph is an assumption...
In fact, bitcoin does obey the more cap = less volatility... u want a link? I can give u link that bitcoin's volatility is on a downtrend...
21 million does have an effect on volatility, but its not dependent on it as ud like to assume. .
Part of volatility equation is demand... decreased demand leads to decreased volatility...
As I said, at saturation point, demand decreases... thus decreasing volatility...
And stop assuming that bitcoin will have no competition. Competition effect bitcoin's demand... IMO, a well-managed fiat can easily outperform a mature bitcoin, making it more enticing...
If ur saying that bitcoin must reach zero volatility before it becomes a currency... then u should know currency markets typically move within 10% in a year... 
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:31:32

Geesh... you only need to look at the charts to notice the price movement...
From 20k, 12k, 10k, 8k... each time it bounced from the 5k-6k line...
Its easy to make an estimated guess that this 8k top bounce would be the last as another top bounce of 6k seems to be too close to the floor of 5k-6k
... its also easy to assume that 5k - 6k will hold as historically, its what been doing...
It can be argued that it this is a triangle with downward pressure... in forex, id prolly take it as such.. but in bitcoin, which there's a bias for a bull (like in stock markets), I'm leaning towards the view of bears losing steam after repeatedly slamming into a wall...
KEEP IN MIND that this is just how I see the markets, making a guesstimate.. this is not a prophecy as i don't have a crystal ball

U on other hand seems to be making claims out of thin air... 
U claim bitcoin to be crap, and yet u go long... the rational trader would short... 
u prolly don't know how to short bitcoin, and yet u claim to be a legendary trader who can spot the peaks...

U have my upvote...
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:04:47
Yeah, its easy to think this way with hindsight...
Here's the better way of seeing this:
How many companies that started the same time apple started? (let's say 100)
Then, how many of those companies are still here now? (let's say 5)
Ur left with a 5% survival rate...
So tell me, how lucky do u feel knowing u have a 5% success rate choosing out of 100 companies?
Of course this is a overly simplified way of looking things.. risk reward ratio plays an important role... (u can bet on all 100 companies, and even with 5% success rate but each win returns 1,000%, then ur win will cover ur losses plus profits... in fact, its better to play the game that way - but this more of an indexing rather than stockpicking)...
@_date: 2018-08-31 08:18:35
Dude... if u base ur certainty with better precision on what u can prove, u won't resort to evasion... ill show u...
 
So u agreed that more cap, more volume needs to create volatile situations... this is simply the physics of money...
Due to this physics of money... my is assessment that bitcoin will stabilize due to this physics of money as the cap grows... I'm 75% certain that this statement will come to pass... 
Is 75% a fair estimate?

This is just partially right... consensus is kinda idiotic.. according to survey, near 50% believe in angels... that'd be disaster if we take consensus alone... 
For specific subjects, we regular people take the consensus of the experts within the field... 
In economics, there's no such consensus, or little, among economists...
Thereby, economic terms are wishy washy at best... u can't say, bitcoin is not money because there no respected authority (that gained experts' consensus) to set that money, by definition, has these and that parameters... 
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:31:49
I tend to see resistances and support as zones and not specific numbers... to me, $4,800 is just a $5k support that slightly overshot... it doesn't mean much, especially when the markets quickly rejects the price...
markets move in upswings and downswings... if it penetrates the 5k support, it doesn't mean much to me unless an upswing occurs or the price moved through the price with very strong momentum... 
If an upswing occurs and it can't go higher than 5k, then its easy to assume the rest of the year is going to be bear

To answer u...
Sun rising tomorrow is a high probability event, but not yet a fact... when it rises, its stops becoming a speculation and then becomes a fact..

if it did not happen yet, no matter how probable it is, its not yet a fact thus in the realms of speculation...

and ur assuming that there's only bitcoin and nothing else so everyone is forced to used it.. how about bitcoin and fiat coexisting? Have u not considered that implication, especially the thing how competition affects bitcoin? 
Example, what's the point of holding bitcoin if a fiat is growing faster?
And that's the enticing thing about fiat, its ability to expand, better at funding economies if done right..

Uhmm... that's a tricky question cos ur generalizing... but ill try to cover...
A) if u ask me, cos I haven't seen any investment vehicle with this kind of ridiculous risk reward ratio... and I've been in the markets since 2009...
The last time this "major" happened was the tech boom.. this could be the next revolution, and u may have to wait for another 10-20 years.. so yeah, holding is in order...
B) some people here don't hold until they "cash out"... for the ones that get it, its hold until bitcoin can be spent/ recieve anywhere... they don't run on the premise like stocks that u need to cash out to fiat to enjoy ur gains... 
I can guarantee u when the time comes bitcoin flats, and it will in the future.. that "hodling" idea will be a thing of the past... seriously, who would be shouting "hodl" with 1-5% annual gain...

bitcoin has two prices, store of value and industrial...
Gold as currency is declining cos its a physical attribute running on a progressing digital world... go check how gold is declining if u don't believe me... just so u know, I have short positions on gold right now...
Ur left with industrial use, and let's be honest.. gold's prices are overinflated with regards to industrial demands...
Let's be honest here...ur biased against bitcoin and that's why ur refusing to see its feature that has potential value... and no amount of convincing will change ur mind... id rather talk to a wall, I have better chances of convincing it to turn into liquid from its solid form...
Pointless and waste of time conversation... 
Here's a better topic... if u hate bitcoin, why are u here in this sub? No one is forcing u to face such conflict...
U sick in the head or something that u can't live without conflict?

Good to know bro, its always better to keep ur plans in place when ur wrong and when ur right :) ...
Personally, I'm rooting for bitcoin... but my trader side is in charge with these things, and he says were on bitcoin for now... 
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:27:07
First of all... I don't believe that gold's price is being "suppressed"... not unless u can control the supply of gold... but even if u can do that the other part of the equation is the demand...and that's the real issue...
Imo, Gold as a store of value is simply outdated... if u look at history, gold has been adopted because it doesn't react, easily identifiable, not too common or rare..  all these qualities are physical-based, which is dwindling in importance as we move further to the digital age...
IMO, gold will continually drop cos of dwindling demand until it reaches the price where its industrial use kicks in...
For bitcoin, unless u can control the miner's output, u can't control it..  u may control it by dumping, but that means buying it in the first place, driving prices upwards... 
Also, futures are settled in cash, which means no one is buying/selling bitcoin to settle the contract, which means it won't affect the price...

Here's another "redditor for a day" with bullshit post... saw already a couple of u today... u guys on overtime or something?
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:02:53
Ill even up the ante by saying "its suppose to..."
Bitcoin's flaw or feature is that its a deflatianory currency... economies built on such currency is slow to grow relative to fiat...  on the upside, the risk of a crash is very low...
When fiat prints money, the newly printed money has no value, but the market will take time to realize this... the central banks are hoping that the newly printed money is going to fund the economy (which also makes the currency more valuable) before the market can fully realize that the supply has been diluted and brings the value down... 
if done correctly, the economy's growth can easily offset the negative effects of printing money... but there's a big caveat... 
"IF DONE CORRECTLY"...
You see, humans has the tendency to fuck things up due to corruption and greed...
The way I see this, bitcoin is going to be the natural police of central banks...
Abuse ur authority and power, people can easily move out from ur currency... this is something that's hard to do prior to bitcoin especially if u have large sum of money...
On the other hand, a well-managed fiat will outgrow bitcoin's mature form (which most likely flats) making it more attractive than bitcoin...
Its likely the two will coexist, naturally balancing each other...
@_date: 2018-09-15 06:29:31
So by saying yada, u are confirming that u are paid shill, spreading fud to discourage the spread of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:40:13
As I always believed, fiat and bitcoin will coexist in the future... 
Inflation is like a business that's taking a loan for expansion... it speeds up growth, but its also carrying extra risk.. 
Bitcoin at its mature form will generally flat, or at least grow at a slow rate compared to inflationary currencies... this mainly due to the fact that like a business, its growing by reinvesting profits rather than taking a loan...its slower, but a lot safer...
The revolution here is that people now have a choice... either to play along with the central bank's game of balancing risk for growth, or people can just stay in the sidelines and take the safer route...
I also believe that a well-managed fiat can outgrow bitcoin when it matures... but bitcoin is going to serve as a "police"... 
take too much risk and abuse, and people can simply move out of ur fiat (lowering demand, and tanking the price), unlike now that most people are forcefully dragged into the mess created by central banks...
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:34:34
U agree right? Correct me if I'm wrong...
So is it illogical for me to conclude that as the market cap of bitcoin grows, the more money u need to plunge to create volatility?
Also, u haven't given ur answer.. I'm politely asking...
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:37:05
Ur still not giving a number?
I asked a simple question... one with precise perimeters so we can obtain a more precise answer... after 5 replies or so, u still haven't given one...
And I'm the one putting a sideshow... 
How certain are u with ur statement? Express in percentage please for the purpose of being more accurate, an attribute which I think we can both agree that its imperative for truth-finding...
Example..."I speculate x, at x% certainty"
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:10:48
Lols.... operating machineries and not knowing what ur doing leads to loss of limbs and death...
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:13:03
U wanna debate or u simply want to impose ur concept is right?
... volatiliy is derived from price movements
... price is dictated by supply and demand
I'm speculating there's a point in the future that the world's demand will be near equilbrium to its CIRCULATING supply...
Ur speculating that bitcoin's demand will continue to skyrocket forever... what happens if everyone has the bitcoin they want or need? Still going to skyrocket?
Here's another thing, volatility is largely affected by cap... the bigger it gets, the less volatile it will be... it just the physics of money...
So are u saying, bitcoin won't obey when it gets bigger and still be volatile as today?
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:49:34
On ur reason no. 3...
What's wrong with those? ...those entails extra risk, and risk is rewarded if ur right.. 
If u can humor me... please elaborate how naked shorts, leveraged trading and all those sorts can be done without taking extra risk? As if someone simply decides one morning and say, "ill naked short btc cos I feel like it" and expects to profit at every turn...

@_date: 2018-08-30 20:57:21
Oh I know its more complex than that.. and I have answer for u after u answered the question I asked u...
U said "at best, bitcoin's volatility will be the same as ibm and google"... how certain are that this speculation will turn out as true (in percentage).
I'm not trying to trick u into anything if ur worried, I'm just trying to have a better picture of how certain u are about ur speculation... as of now, I'm getting the feeling that ur 100% sure of that statement... that's why I'm asking if its true...
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:02:22
Yeah, clearly ur not... and claiming that occurence happened only twice in the past is a proof of that...
...and just so u know, ur not smart predicting bitcoin will flat or tank in the future... that's like predicting the world will end, which is 100% sure it will... but it could happen tommorow or a million years from now...
The range of ur prediction is so wide, it becomes a pointless...

Cos in reddit, its easy to make a messy debate without bringing up an authorative body... a lot of people here make trading and economic statements because this school and that person says so... 
In a lot of ways, the mess can be easily prevented by clearing out that there's no authorative body in trading and economics... 
I'm essentially saying, before this gets too long, know that ur assumptions are not facts. Thus, don't stand on it as if its like its evolution theory. Economics, for the large part, is more of a theology rather than science... 
Oh btw, above is not aimed at you, but for the general readers and why I'm "hung up" on authorative body...

My original point states that the momentum will decrease... u said it won't...
We are talking about the future, thus speculating...
Also, the term the "best" is very subjective... best design? To some perhaps... best speed? Nope...  best specs? Nope...

Yeah, the term short squeeze has been overused and the true meaning has been lost...
What most people mean is a bear trap...
The true definition of short squeeze is when a whale A gets wind of whale B's huge short position, then whale A buys all or most of the supply.. now whale B will be racking a huge loss cos there's no more supply he can buy to close his position... essentially, the move is intended to deny whale B of closing his position to force a racking of loss...

I swear, all these naysayers are from first wold countries that have zero intimate knowledge of how the rest of the planet works outside their bubbles...
Come here to my country, and ud realize how valuable an accurate and immutable piece of record is...
U have no experience about people being stripped of money and land because a rich and influential idiot can pay people to alter records, and then claim ownership...
Frankly, stop talking about bitcoin... it solves a problem that u have no idea about cos u live in a country that DOES NOT need bitcoin...

In other words, hyperinflation is always a risk.. so please don't separate from hyperinflation from inflationary currency as if the two are not on the same side of the coin...
Oh, "controlled money" supply... so who's doing the controlling? Do u trust them? Are they better than the market's ability to balance itself? 
 
Btw, whats stopping them from let's say, put a million on their pocket? ... if u think it doesn't affect u, keep in mind that currency is just a transmitter of value... 
so when they print money for themselves? Where's the value coming from?.. yep! From our savings account! 
So while u keep touting inflationary currency is good, those people just invented a way to steal value under ur nose... so please understand why I'm not so keen on believing those people...

Again, I'm not saying bitcoin will fail.. I'm more interested in:  
Do u  think there's a chance bitcoin may be overtaken?
If no - that's ur belief, I can't touch that... but if its up to me, that's sounds like a religion...
If yes, what's ur system in place to let you know that u could be wrong...
My original reply was the dangers of bitcoin maximalism mentality... the boat could be sinking and maximalists may end up finding themselves at the bottom of the ocean cos of such mentality...

"I could be wrong"...

Look, inflatianory currency has its pros and cons... just like deflatianory currency.. 
The way I see it, inflatianory has the advantage of accelerating economies as its similar to a loan in a way u can get more capital and lenders will lend u money cos they know u can repay it because of future cashflow... 
on the downside, just like taking a loan, u run on the risk of taking too many loans and getting too much in debt... and we all know how terrible it is to have bad credit..
Deflationory currency has the upside of not running into debt problems..  on downside, its slower...
Its the reason why I believe bitcoin and fiat can coexist together and create a natural balance...
Govt can run their fiat, and increase economic growth, which results to investors flocking in because it offers better returns than a flatting bitcoin (yes, it will flat eventually)...
But if the govt abuse their power too much and run into the debt problems, investors would stop lending, start collecting and move out and return to bitcoin...
Imo, bitcoin is what the economy needs.. its the other side of the coin so the economy can balance itself...
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:57:11

@_date: 2018-05-14 17:47:19
Lols, what u are taking about is using mathematical models trying to predict an outcome...
First of all, no politician would push for a deflatianory economy cos it doesn't benefit them... why would u want a restricted money supply if need money for funding and some (maybe more) for ur pocket... its a lot better to print money now, hide the value, and let the next batch deal with the problems u created...
I agree that it won't make a nation competitve as every nation is taking debts for growth... its just like taking a business loan for expansion...
It fuels growth,but it comes with a risk.. a risk that not politicians is going to pay for, but the everyday citizen... btw, the politicians and bankers are getting a heads up and already stashed their money safely...
And two, its good that bitcoin isn't a country or nation, which means it has no directive to stay competitive... it becomes an option for people who doesn't want to become a participant of the games played by central banks.. 
I do believe that bitcoin and fiat will co-exist in the future... bitcoin is just the balancing element that naturally polices central banks from abusing their powers... 
The way I see it, a nicely managed fiat can outperform bitcoin (cos it will eventually flat)... but abuse ur lead, and people now have the option of leaving ur fiat...

Newsflash! Economics barely has any consensus on anything...
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:14:17
That's according to people who are big believers of inflation..  the same people who have the power to print money... 
Bottom line, I haven't heard of a nation that runs solely on deflationary currency... so u can say, continuing with bitcoin is uncharted territory...
most of the examples of deflationary economies are mere reaction of an inflating currency in the first place...

Markests are more or less, not exact, a collection of perception among other things... 
I'm just suggesting to anchor ur beliefs to a degree with the markets..  
Let's say an altcoin soars twice the price of bitcoin? U still going to argue that bitcoin is the best because of what? Ur beliefs?
I'm not pointing that bitcoin is going to lose...I'm just pointing out that this "unmovable" belief on bitcoin is dangerous.
The other scenario is ull eventually ditch ur belief? The question now becomes, what's ur trigger to ditch that belief?
My answer to that question is the markets... its less subjective, and I get to be free from my bias...

I find candle patterns in crypto rather arbitrary...
In stocks, yeah, much accurate because the opening bell starts at the same time... everyone is synchronized...
In crypto, there's no opening and closing bell... a pinbar to u may look like a long bear candle to another user depending on what time he/she sets the open...
But on a broader sense... I always see trading as profit through consistent use of settings rather than finding a magic setting....

I'm reading it, I'm still not getting the "fraud"... 
Bitmex is a futures exchange.. u don't buy actual bitcoin there... 
Is he saying that bitmex is a market maker and not a real broker? ... big deal... when u trade, ur always against someone, either its another person or a market maker broker...
The only problem with market maker brokers is they have capabilities to manipulate the price tick to trigger stop losses...
Here's the problem with that, whales also hunt stop losses as its a source of liquidity... ur not really sure who's hunting ur stops, the broker or whales...
well, shit happens and why u need proper money management.   I always take this as "cost of doing business..

This is often a picture that I like to believe, but I think about it, its not totally true... but I may agree, that its largely true... 
Case in point, binance coin... a good portion of buyers are not interested for growth, but rather the discount... same is true in forex, not all participants are trying to eat someone else's lunch... for example, a large company wants to buy a certain currency to start a project in that specific country...  the company's main goal is to have a currency to use, not eat the trader's lunch...

There are two ways u can see this inflation...
First, since im doubling the money supply but not doubling the value in the pool... im essentially diluting the value of each dollar... the "theft" comes if I double the money supply, and I own the newly printed money... in that sense, if u can see it, I just "moved" value from ur money to my newly printed money...
Second view... keynesian makes the statement that the scenario above is not "stealing" but rather stimulating the economy cos the newly printed money is going to fund the growth of the economy... thus, what they are HOPING is that the money and value they've just diluted will become "undiluted" plus more when the returns of the stimulated economy kicks in... in other words, its not stealing but merely taking a business loan... 
Keep in mind, the word "HOPING".. yeah, its not guaranteed their economic policies will work...
Btw, I'm not on either side of this deflation and inflation thing... I see both sides having each pros and cons.. its up to u to decide which one is right for u...
Also.. keep in mind that there's a "lag" the moment I print more money, and when the market will settle to find the right value...
Hence, if I own the central bank...I can double the money right now, control the newly printed money and buy other assets for hedging...  when the currency devalues because of the dilution... I still get to keep the value of my newly printed money cos its already hedged on a different asset... this scenario is always a danger with central banks if its run by a greedy idiot...

It all depends really... if ur putting in after paycheck, yeah cost dollar averaging works.. 
But if u have all the money u want to invest, there's no big difference in the long run...
If u take the premise that no one knows the immediate future prices... then cost averaging into a rising market means losing gains...on the other hand, if on a downmarket, ur buying cheap.. 
here's the caveat, u don't know the price tomz... it could be up or down... in essence, cost dollar averaging doesn't give u a statistical "edge"..

Uhmm.. that easier done on centralized markets than crypto.. each exchange has its own price.. but price "normalizes" due to the arbitragers...
Also, ud have a big problem if u do that...
Let's say ur an exchange, and u say the price of btc is 6k and other exchanges say its 10k... the question now becomes, who's selling at 6k? U the exchange or other people?
If other people, who's gonna sell at 6k? He/she must beyond retarded...
If u the exchange, that means u bough up btc before u can sell.. so at what price did u buy it? 5k? But why sell it at 6k when u can sell it for 10k?

Then I short on futures, then dump on btc markets...
Uhmm.. how do u know it will plummet, and make sure there are no whales waiting to buy ur dump, causing the price NOT to dip?
When in fact, the bigger whale might see ur dump as a way to completely fill their order demands that no bunch of retail traders can ever fulfill...

ALL markets are manipulated to some degree, not just bitcoin... here's one example...
 the problem with newb traders is they think that that whales can just click a button and expect instant fills (just like a retail trader)...
No! They have a huge problem with fills...  so for example, if they want to buy at 10k... because of the huge order, they can't expect the price to stay at 10k and expect 100% fill... so what do they do? 
Hunt for liquidity... or also know as hunting ur stop loss... ur stop loss is just a sell order, and that's liquidity for them... 
Since they can affect the market cos of their huge orders, its common for them to manipulate a price to a support to hit those sell orders (ur stop loss)... 
This way, they can get a better fill without causing the price to move away too much from their desired entry...
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:55:25

In the daily timeframe, bitcoin is actually bouncing up and down to form a triangle...

that's the issue here.. for people who are not interested to play the money game, they can't (or very difficult) to save their way to a better life... 
I'm saying this and I trade for a living... in my opinion, the game is just too rigged for people who knows how to play the game...

Look, ur are using "printing money" as a very loose term... while ur viewing it as "printing money, I see it as "carrying risk"... 
Let's say coinbase can do that... they are essentially carrying the risk that not everyone is going to convert their Bitcoin at the same time as that will cause insolvency, or they have to buy bitcoin themselves... how they manage and optimize this risk is up to them and they get rewarded with more working capital...
Keep in mind that central banks are the only ones that are legally able to do this, anyone else is called counterfeiting... 
For other banks, they need to put up a "collateral" to the central bank and the central bank leverages that money... so if a bank gives 100$ as collateral, central banks will then give them $1000 perhaps...
Now, u can loosely describe this as "printing money" as the bank gave 100$ and turned it into $1000.. but by that definition, everyone else is also "printing money" everytime they take a loan to buy something

Ur assuming that people won't invest.. just because people are not losing value with deflation, it doesn't mean that people would stop investing... the game simply changes to having the deflation rate as the benchmark...
today, the inflation is the benchmark...while it can be argued that it may be a better way of motivating people, it comes with a price... specifically, its very difficult for anyone to save their way for a better life as inflation continually eats savings...
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:19:53

@_date: 2018-05-23 03:04:35
Unless coinbase can print bitcoin from thin air, they can't run a "fractional reserve"... they may "paper sell," but they have to put the bitcoin if a customer transfers it to some wallet...
U could argue that they could "guarantee" ur bitcoin if it stays in their wallets, which allows them to paper sell to a point... then it could be in the realms of fractional banking... 
However, this just becomes more of a derivatives rather than fractional banking as ur not "printing bitcoin"...
Also, they may shut down if more people want usd than their bitcoin reserves can handle... which means they would have to buy some btc to cover, then its not fractional..

Both has its pros and cons... inflation may have its pro, but the cons are just ridiculous.. for one,controllers have ways of stealing "value" from other people...
two, hyperinflation caused by bad decision-making... humans can be corrupt, I don't trust people managing money or the economy, especially considering that if it fucks up, the controllers have already protected themselves and its the people who's gonna pay for their mistakes

As I always say, most people seem to forget about the utility of "immutable ledger"...
Take in the case of land grabbing... land grabbing by the rich is often done by making a newly created title and faking all the supporting records (through buying them out), then buying the court so ur title becomes the "fake" one... 
An immutable ledger won't allow u to "fake" or alter the records (theoretically)...
This is what happens in our country... if this doesn't happen to urs, then u likely live in a first world..but ur country is not the majority in this planet...
Which brings me to the conclusion, its not the first world that will spread adoption... 
for first worlds, bitcoin is just the alternative.. in 3rd worlds, bitcoin is the sane option...

Stable is tricky word... if u want stable, as in completely non-moving stable, then no currency will fit the bill.. but I agree with u with the statement.. 
On the other hand, it just needs to be stable enough, perhaps fluctuating less than 5% a year, and Bitcoin can work as currency and store of value
Bitcoin will generally flat sooner or later, much like the major currencies...

Bitcoin is eventually going to flat or move up very slowly... a well managed fiat can outrun Bitcoin's growth, which means some fiats will become more attractive than bitcoin...

First of all, your talking about investments and not about consumer spending... those two have requires different thought process...
When u buy real estate, ur primary thinking is - I want to protect the value of my money or at least earn from my investment... yeah u could say its similar, but here's the question...
When it comes to public spending, what portion is that for investment or consumer spending?
I don't know exactly, but looking at my friends, its prolly less than 20%...
Now, the problem is using that 20% to justify an entire system...
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:26:20
"economics may be a science, but economists are not scientists" 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:21:25
My point is - using that reason of "ill buy now cos my money has less value next year" sounds like reason created by an economist with an agenda and someone who seems to have no contact with human behavior... 
If u have said, inflationary currency is advantageous because it can use future "income" to fund today's economy, which makes it grow faster, then that I can agree with...
Its the same reasoning with marijuana law - they say its "medicinal" and "benificial"... how about we start the debate from its core - "no government should be able to dictate on what I put into my body as long as it does not harm anyone"...
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:35:07
So in ur world, 10% is enough to establish a system that has a major impact on human daily life? 
If 10% of deaths is caused by cars, would u ban cars? Or some similar reasoning?
Also, I don't believe that all mono inflationary or deflatioanory is healthy.. a system that can balance itself is what I consider ideal, and that means bitcoin and fiat balancing each other in response to economic condition and public's fear and greed tolerance level...
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:31:16
I'm a bitcoin supporter, but you have to know there's a correlation between risk and speed... the more stable, the slower it gets...
The reason why most nations adopt fiat is because it has speed but that also means a lot riskier... govt are trying to compete with each other and the best tool for that is fiat not silver or gold...
My take, bitcoin and fiat will coexist.. one trying to balance the other... if govt gets too reckless, then people move to bitcoin.. if bitcoin becomes too slow, people move to fiat...

Lols its not entirely about gold being scarce that makes it valuable, its a combination of things... in fact, if its too rare, it would be inefficient... imagine having having 1 ounce of gold it entire world and 1 million people trying to use it as currency... it becomes so difficult that people will look for an alternative...
Gold has the right amount of rareness, its non-reactive (meaning it won't turn into some other metal in 100 years), visually distinct and easy to work with (other metals need high amounts of heat that no pre-industrial times furnace can produce)... 
My take,we settled on gold not because some govt dictated it but more of a process of evolution. Humans prolly tried plenty of metals in the past and finally settled on gold out of trial and error
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:06:48
Might be true, but do you have data on consumer spending vs investment spending?
Even then, humans have this thing called greed, and it doesn't mean ur losing value, u stop buying investments... 
So if from that 20%, a portion of that is due to greed and not because ur "afraid that the value of ur money looses"...
So what, u left with 10%-15% to justify a system?
.. and mind you, I'm not anti-inflatianory.. I see both as a naturally balancing each other (bitcoin) .. inflationary has its strengths like speed that bitcoin can never hope to accomplish..
But using that reasoning of "losing value" sounds purely theoretical and barely applies in the real world. Sounds like an argument thats formulated by an economist with an agenda...
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:35:46
There you go! This one has the right answer.. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:32:12
Ur right, inflatianory currency has the ability to "expand" and use that expanded money to grow the economy... 
The problem is, throw a wrench in the cog and it will break down... corruption and greed are the most destructive wrenches to that machine...
A PROPERLY runned fiat can easily outgrow bitcoin when it matures as bitcoin can't "expand"...

On the upside, u also going to have a cluster of 5 wins in a row every 32 trades... now! Can u stay displined after 5 wins in a row? Likely, ull feel invincible and u start making "wild" bets...

Newsflash: there's no way u can "dump" without increasing the price first...
To make the pump and dump work.. u need to pump and make sure the market is tricked so it will continue to grow higher before u dump for a profit... 
otherwise, if it doesn't continue to go higher, then u dump at a loss since ur the one that increased it in the first place and u got fees to pay...
So this is idea of pump and dump that its risk-free and billionaires do it all the time is naive on how the market works...

I have the same analysis.. its the developing nations that are "forced" to adopt bitcoin first because the alternative isn't better... 
...most naysayers come from places with a privileged  banking system, saying visa, mastercard or x is better... while this is true for such places, its only a small portion of the planet...
It will start from developing nations and seep into first world... I think the first adopters from the first world are the travelers (and of course the ones that realizes the importance of the tech)... then from travelers to mainstream...
Its also the reason why I think therell be a massive shift in wealth if the revolution comes to fruition...

"extreme volatility" has nothing to with good or bad... its more on the risk tolerance of the investor...

It all boils down to risk tolerance...

I'll try to stick to the main topic...
That's the problem with ur conviction, how do u know that theory u believe in so much is not spread by somebody who have vested interest on u swallowing that preaching?
U can't deny, most of economic theory (not all) is based on their interpretation in the absence of testable and repeatable results... hence, there's a race by different economic schools to spread their version of the interpretation, and that's vested interest at the very least.. 
U believe so much that people buy logically, cos that's what keynesian school is preaching to better their stance...  but is that true or political agenda? Think about that...
U may not agree on with me... but the lack of consensus among economist, plus my first hand experience of market behavior (dipped my feet in forex last 2009) leads me to believe that markets can't be accurately modeled nor predicted... 
Feel free to what u believe in... btw, I'm very skeptical of ur original argument about buying behavior because its comes from Keynesian school,and since they are running the show, it will serve their agenda if I swallow it blindly...
I think u should be skeptical too... after all, would u blindly believe an insurance salesman saying u should buy this and that insurance?

That's a stretch to say trading stops when altcoins are labeled illegal... for one, US does not hold the most volume in crypto.. also, "illegal" is geographically locked, while crypto is not... Then there's the issue of enforcement... 
trading crypto is a lot cheaper and a lot easier to gain entry compared to stocks or other forms, so even if its branded is illegal, assuming that people stop trading is a bit of stretch cos there's no alternative...
For example, in our country, u need at least $20k to even start thinking of running an index style trading strategy... with crypto's, ull have more diversity with just $100... at that situation, even if our country brands crypto illegal, the crypto investors won't magically transfer to stocks cos of costs...

Sorry if I seem to confuse trading and investing... in my view, there's a small difference between trader and investor..  the only difference is the timeframe.. in my view, investors "trade" in terms of years... 
No offense bro, there are arguments why its hard to predict prices both in long and short timeframes...
U just pointed out the reason for longer timeframes, shorter time frames have significantly higher frequency for "noise"... 
but hey,if ur making money trading intraday, I'm not here to argue...
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:14:06
Yeah, was thinking about that... but since were talking about money, I wouldn't try something untested or something I haven't tried yet
@_date: 2018-06-02 08:04:34
First of all, bitcoin won't replace fiat, it will coexist, naturally balancing each other... despite its growing rapidly right now (year to year basis).. it will eventually flat or grow extremely slow... 
A well run fiat can easily outgrow bitcoin simply because its taking more risk (similar to a way that a business loans more capital for growth, and lenders will have no probs lending just as long the business's money coming in is good health).
...now for ur question, a bank can simply lend money they 100% own to anyone (with interest) who needs the money to buy anything... its a lot slower, but its possible... 
on the upside, an economy built on solid ground like that will have a hard time collapsing...
On the downside, it can't compete with the turbo-boosted economies running on inflating currency...
The good thing with bitcoin is its not own by any country, thus it has no desire to outcompete other countries or currencies... it will serve as a safe haven for people who don't want to play with the central bank's game of balancing risk, debt and growth... an option that's hardly possible before bitcoin came along.. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:13:57
I'm not,ur the one that keeps ditching my main question of how economies started before govt existed?
Lols, before govt existed to "back" fiat, gold and silver served as a form of currency facilitating trade with other countries that are not under jurisdiction of the romans...economies were built on top of it...
In other words, if u can build economies without govt backing, then it can be built on bitcoin... 
The statement above makes ur assumption wrong that states bitcoin is useless as currency...

ALL markets are manipulated to a degree... a retail trader's job is to be on the side of the ones doing the manipulation...
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:57:02
That's my point..  some people are savers, some are spenders... and we all know there are a lot of spenders out there..  u can't magically convert a behavior cos a change of currency...
I came from the a third world country, and when I visit the US... I can't believe how much people spend on "wants" convincing themselves its a "need"... 
in our place, the needs and wants are clearer... 
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:02:18
The problem comes from the fact that nobody knows the future vs people making claims basing on the grounds of "I'm very sure" ...
That's why I always advocate to view things in gradient not black and white... adjust ur convictions to the level of certainty...
If ur only 50% sure bitcoin will drop, then don't argue as if ur standing on 100% certainty.. 
For example, I have come to a lot of arguments in this thread thinking that ADVANCED economic theories are certain like how evolution theory is certain... 
when in fact its not... even economist can't have a consensus, and yet people here are arguing from a position that they are very certain (yes, I'm ALSO talking to u keynesian nutheads)
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:50:25
U don't need to be a genius to realize that the supply side of bitcoin is capped, while the demand side is uncapped... barring changes in protocol, its easy to conclude that bitcoin's price MAY astronomically shoot up  simply because of supply and demand (this is assuming that bitcoin will reach widespread adoption, but that's the bet here)
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:28:04
That's assuming that people would switch to bcash, not on other coins or even leave crypto...
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:27:16
That's the point of trading, spotting inefficiencies of market value...
My point is... what ur saying isn't simple as it may sound, otherwise, we'd be all rich trading... and the stats say 80% of traders lose money
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:02:13
Dude, ur assumption is mostly correct if bitcoin is being mainly used as currency...unfortunately, or fortunately depending on who you're talking to, bitcoin is mostly used as a speculative investment...
Having said that, there's no rule out there that says a speculative investment CAN'T become currency as time moves forward... 
In fact, forex is considered by may as "speculative investment" and its all about currency... furthermore, most stock investors stay away from forex as they consider it as "too volatile"... 
And if u think bitcoin will remain this volatile forever... then its either ur not that informed on how markets develop or u have deep bias against bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:23:16
First of all, were all speculating here cos were talking about the future.. once we establish that, we can begin to explore...
The reason for that analysis is because bitcoin is going to eventually flat or grow painfully slow...
A well managed fiat can easily outgrow bitcoin, making it attractive to hold..  but the caveat is, it needs to be well managed...  hence, once mismanagement happens or the currency is making too many risk, people can simply move to bitcoin...
In that scenario, the two naturally balances each other...

As short as possible, explain how economies started before govt existed as it seems ur arguing that u need govt for economies to exist...
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:44:32
The reason why its recking ur nerve is because u didn't formulate a good trading plan... 
U see, there are a lot of ways at looking at the market, and lots more of formulating a trading plan...
Here's an example:
If I'm swing trading (which means holding for day or weeks, rarely months and not definitely in years)...I look for areas in the market in which in my opinion gives me good risk reward ratio, and make a buy... since I know my target, and I know my stop limit before placing a trade,  and the trade gives me good risk reward ratio... its already a profitable trade in the long run even before I place the trade.. 
Now, when betting on bitcoin fundamentals (which means holding for years).. ur trading plan, or say bet proposition is different...
In such case, it all boils down to this...
If I bet right now, what are the chances of succeeding and what's the pay off?
The beauty of bitcoin (which no other financial instrument can compare right now) is the potentially ridiculous risk:reward ratio... 
So let's say, u bet $1,000 and bitcoin can potentially grow that to x10 ($10,000)... giving u a 1:10 risk reward ratio...
That means, u can afford to lose 9 times and win once and ud still break even... at that rate, u only need to be right 10% of the time to break even... now, ill ask u...
In ur opinion, what's the estimated success rate of bitcoin growing 10x? 
If ur estimate is more than 10%, then ur bet is already making a profit from the moment u place ur bet...
Hence, with such perspective... don't worry if u lose the money, cos its already a profitable trade in the long run to begin with... 
Its possible that u might lose on bitcoin, but if u keep betting with such perspective on other investment vehicles... ud win in the long run...
This also leads to bankroll management...u need to make sure ur bankroll can afford to take the hit a couple of times so when its ur time to win, u still have money to bet, and win to recoup ur losses and some profits...
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:52:09
Hahahaoa... "computer hardware"... that's a market segment that runs on egos... 
Okay, let's say u get a "hotter girl"... so you really think the buying stops there? ... what if ur hot girl, wants this and that..  u seriously can use logic against women?
 ... dude, correct me if I'm wrong, but u seem to have no experience with women...
Look at the average female and try to assess how much of their spending is based on logical decision-making.. 
And that's the real problem with that argument...its all based on logic, when humans are illogical, especially women, which is perhaps the biggest driver of economy.. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:48:33
Still, what's in it for them?
...Just to say "I told u so"? ...with limited time in a day, ur gonna invest in that activity so u just u can say "I told u so" while invite a lot of stress from people u don't know?
...for normal people, most would invest their time on something they enjoy... not invite stress, unless u have gaping mental problems or a paid shill...
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:31:23
Most experienced traders already learned to separate emotions and trading...
Cryptos are easier to get in compared to other forms of trading (even forex)... hence, its safe to assume there's a lot of inexperienced traders in here, which I don't have problems really... no point in becoming the best 10th player in world when ur facing the top 9 hihihii...
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:22:28
Dude, you should stop posting something like this... ur clearly agitated to the point u can't seem to recognize I'm on ur side of that bet...
These negative comments are making u agitated...
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:44:08
It has no value to u.. and that's ur opinion...
Bitcoin has unique features that no fiat can simply duplicate... how u value that feature is up to u... and so is everyone else.. collectively, that defines what the market is all about... 
At this point ur simply pushing that ur opinion is better than everyone else... 
so are u really that full of yourself to think ur opinion is the only one that matters? 
Let me take that back... since ur not shorting bitcoin, u don't have skin in the game.. 
ur opinion is worth less than nothing, cos even u are not confident enough to put money on on ur own opinion... 
hey, if bitcoin is a sure loss, that means its a sure win when it goes to zero... So tell me, why are u not betting on a sure win?
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:18:08
its not surprising really... its especially common when a lot of emotional players are in the game... 
observe during a strong bull run, serious bad news will barely dent the market.. 
Same as on the flipside, when markets are on a strong bear run, serious good news won't make the markets turn...
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:52:38
According to wyckoff's theory... whales have two phases, accumulating and dumping... 
So, ur other question is misguided, they are not always dumping... u prolly just got into the market during the dumping phase...
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:07:48
Look, I dipped my feet in currency trading since 2009...and here's my main point...
Prices are dictated by supply and demand... u can try to "dictate" the price, but don't expect that to hold... sooner or later, everyone follows that law...
Also, I can't wrap my head around what ur trying to dictate. The exchange rate or the price of a certain goods?
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:43:29
Meh, any markets is always manipulated... its just a question of degrees... one of the major manipulators are the owners of mainstream media channels... 
when they are accumulating, FUD's are out.. when they want to sell, "next big thing" is the news...

Zoom out to the daily timeframe, use candlestick.. u can't miss the triangle... 
Buyers and sellers are coming close to a price of equlibrium.... after that, it may flat or volume influx that restarts the cycle, much like a guitar string that's been given a new pluck...
But based on historical price behavior, the probability is on a breakout to the upside...

@_date: 2018-06-29 09:43:34
Its more of an opinion rather than anything else... but I've intensively been trading for straight two years, but started sporadically since 2009...
Price SEEMS to be having trouble falling below 6k..  if this is going to bounce, this is going to be the 3rd bounce since 20k... and that will "solidify" the floor in my perspective...
Its also midyear, historically, its the time the whales start to pump this and dump on dec-jan...
But again, these are opinions... I don't have a crystal ball... but that's what trading is all about, we interpret the market, form opinions and put money behind it...
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:09:01

@_date: 2018-06-04 16:29:03
I'm not sure what ur trading, but if ur trading bitcoin, I doubt what ur saying is true... bitcoin prices are jerky (which could go either way) with plenty of low volatility in between (intraday)... this puts trend bias out of wack... but then again, if u say so, I have no plans checking ur stats, and I doubt if ud show...
To the contrary bro, a lot more professioanals would claim longer time frames are better.. personally, basing on my experience, this tends to be true...
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:30:00
That's not the point... the point is u support ur trading plan with ur assessment... 
Why, do u know the chance of success of rate of bitcoin?
Why, do u know how much bitcoin will grow before it flats? 
We don't know, but we make our guesses and put money behind it... that's essentially what trading is all about...

IMO... the word "centralization" is a word that is now hated in crypto and now equates the word to bad... 
One of the reasons why bitcoin was created is so take away centralized power and control...
Point is, I don't care if amazon gets centralized (all nodes linking to them), just as long amazon can't print more bitcoin, change ledger entries or change bitcoin's protocol at will...
Not all centralization is a cause for hysteria...

Again, u talk a lot and make statements that makes little sense, all the while refusing to believe gold wasn't used as currency just so u can continue believing that govt need to exist for currencies to exist...

Thus, economies can exist without govt...

I'm not arguing about the flaws as I know that there's a lot of crap coins out there...my point is in the practical and actionable side of things...
Here's scenario, we all know bitcoin is the biggest contender, but its success is not guaranteed...

Hence, don't argue matter with the markets even if u think ur right...

I don't get what u mean especially considering that historically, but correct me if I'm wrong.,no fiat has survived more than 200 years...
So when that fiat comes crashing down, do u think that central bank operators won't hedge the money they made from the system? U think they are noble to go down with the ship?
Forcing or enticing people to join ur system, and cashing out before it nosedives to death seems like an activity of someone running a pyramid scheme...

9k? .. still not sure its going dip even more, might be just a pullback... 
7k?... this might be good spot to short, but lets wait for more confirmation in case we get faked out.. 
5k? F"ck the price zoomed... this is too low, there's no room for profit if we short...
.... get the idea?

IMO, One of the biggest reasons why I believe markets will be difficult to accurately model is because its a dynamic entity...
One way to describe this through poker...if ur neural network determines that playing Ace King in a certain way makes the most profit...
If u keep doing that play over and over again and if enough people do the same play, the market will adjust to counter that play, rendering the play unprofitable and even to the point of being exploitable (u can GTO the markets, but it won't be wildly profitable)
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:19:05
I do get ur point, but here's the scenario:
*I'm making money NOW
* I could POTENTIALLY make more by attacking...
As a company, most prefer to stay on the safe side... unless of course the incentive of attacking is massively more profitable... but I don't see that from happening... 
At the moment, If bitcoin tanks, 90% of the coins tank... so whatever coin u control and want to replace bitcoin, the safe assumption is it will also tank if u attack bitcoin...

@_date: 2018-06-05 13:33:28
Nothing is for certain, but I'm leaning towards a break on the upside as bitcoin is nowhere near saturation point... and, were just on the pullback right now... the upper trendline that's forming the roof the triangle (daily tf) is still a bit far... 
even then, at this rate, what's the roof, 8k? And when it bounce for the bottom, its 7.5k? I thnk its too tight... I think there's a good chance there'll be a breakout... its also june, midyear? Whales may start to pump this till december then the regular january dip
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:49:12
Again, u talk a lot without thinking...
Ur main argument was bitcoin can't be used as currency as there's no govt to "enforce" its value... 
this argument is terribly incorrect as there are plenty of economies in history that runs on gold and no government to back it up...
Can u not get that part? Ur too focused on lables (commodity, currency when the two are interchangeable thus labels are meanigless)..
Here's a bright idea for u kid...
"currency is just a transmitter of value"
 ... it doesn't have to be backed by anything, only societies (not necessarily a govt enforcement) agreeing that it will serve a transmitter of value...
Stop ur mental gymnastics and u can see things clearer...

I understand ur sentiments and I do agree it will cause a crash... nonetheless, just like any crashes before, bitcoin and crypto markets will eventually rise up again...
Been trading for a long time (dipped my feet in forex last 2009), and never before I've seen the likes of bitcoin... 
its like investing in amazon in the early days, but with the benefit of near-impossible to shut down or kill... plus, there are plenty of usecases for bitcoin, from a currency to investment diversification purposes (cos its currently uncorrelated with any known markets, a feature that's desirable if u want to spread risk)... 
Basically, its like - if u can't kill, then its likely going up...
And I agree with u about the govt's ridiculous flexing of authority... thankfully, this one they can't simply order it to shut down...
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:30:50

The more I talk to u, the more I'm convinced ur a kid... I don't have the time to be a teacher so here's what u need to know...
There two major school of economics - austrian and keynesian...
Ur bias against bitcoin tells me ur reading from keynesian school...  now if ur smart as u want to perceived.. 
strip that bias away and start reading on the austrian side, and make ur own opinion after that... 
Forming opinions without looking both sides is simply unintelligent...

that's not the point..  look at what ur doing now, and check how much electricity that's not a "need" or simply to serve UR comfort and entertainment, which has far less importance on building a network that can serve as a police to central bank's games...  
my ultimate point is the "convenience" of the argument... its hypocritical... barely anyone cared about electricity use (at least in my country), but since it can be used to FUD bitcoin, its suddenly a narrative.. how convenient...
I'm not a maximalist, but if u got altcoins there that can topple bitcoin, I'm okay with that...my only interest to have a form of currency that can balance the abusive fiats...  for now and until ur altcoin can prove it, bitcoin is the best chance...

Pfftt... stock markets generally follows the performance of dow jones and/or s&amp;p... 
This kind of behavior isn't something unique to crypto...give it enough time, and majority of cryptos will start following a sort of index (like top 10 or 20)...

"normal" is a relative term... 
And yes, markets go boom and recession... but how much it swings from the mean is the main difference...
Inflationary currency is like drinking redbull and vodka, it puts everything in overdrive... but once u crash, ull crash hard...
Deflatianory currency are a lot slower, but the swings are not that wild as ur not pumping it in the first place...
Each has its pros and cons, and frankly, id let the people decide... but before bitcoin, most of us don't have the option of opting out from the game that all central banks play...

U seem to have tried TA and failed and now complaining... here's a "AHA" moment for you... 
Ill take that 50% chance you say...
But here's the difference...
Ill set my risk to reward ration to 1:2.. that means for every $1, I set my profit target to give me $2 NET profit.. 
So lets say I do 10 trades at 50% chance...
5 losses = $5 lost 
5 wins = $10 won
Net = +5$
So where does TA come in? ...if you know how to look, you have a better chance of finding spots that will give you that 1:2 trade...
Is it 100% sure? Oh hell no.. 
But even 50% ur making money...
I have to admit, TA is not everything in trading...id prolly say ony 25%-50% of it... but its an important part of the entire system...
In fact, ur trading mindset is even more importan that TA...

Lols, I trade in forex.. dipped my feet since 2009... lols... fiat, bitcoin or whatever.. I merely see these as tools to reach a goal...
Value is ambiguous and the constant price movements from one currency versus another is a proof of that... buyers and sellers have  different opinions of where the value should be, thus the price moves to find that equilibrium between the buyers and sellers... 
Bitcoin losing 100% overnight? Lols... ur being dramatic... that's just ur opinion... so how much money are u willing to put on that opinion? 
... but let me guess, ur too p*ssy to short bitcoin to zero? If so, u aren't even confident enough to put money behind ur opinion...

uhhmm.... technically, they can create money from thin air, but it doesn't mean it has no consequences...
This is just one, and only one of the troubles for printing money out of thin air... and I put it simply as I can...
There's a certain amount of value in the pool, and its represented by cash.. for arguments sake:
There's 100 worth of value, and its represented by 100 cash... that means, 1 worth of value is represnted by $1 cash
U print money to $200 but that doesn't mean the value also doubles... instead u get..
$1 cash now represents .50 worth of value...
In other words... any govt that can print fiat will have a limit of how much bitcoin they can buy with the value they control/own and not cash...
So why do they print money in the first place? To boost the economy... a simple way of explaining thir is by:
U show 10 people u have $100... u borrow from 10 people $100 each... they have no probs with it cos they have seen ur $100... of course, eventually, those 10 people will hear the news that you borrowed from 10 people and that means u might not be able to pay for the $100 u borrowed...
But keep in mind that there's a "lag time" before people know u borrowed from 10 people, and u just bloated ur $100 to $1100...
So what you do is buy that $1100 with idk, pancakes? And sell it at 100% roi.. now u just doubled ur money money to $2200.. u pay back everyone, and ur left with $1,200.. 
U see, by printing money, and taking advantage of the lag time, u just turned ur $100 to $1200...
But this could also blow up in your face and thats the problem with fiat... these "risk management" the govt doe can blow up in everyone's faces...

There are plenty of Austrian economic schools... but generally, the camp is a fan of using real assets to peg currencies and economies...
But seriously though, the camp will have a hard time pushing their ideas simply because politicians and central banks love the idea of printing money... then pocketing a few m/billions, hedging the value in other assets while the market adjusts to the "fair" market value... 
Also, the "lets print now and let the next batch solve the problem" is another popular idea...
Aaannnnnd before u post ur ideas on how central banks and politicians won't or can't do that... Don't bother...

I do agree, but that's easier to do in regulated markets... bank whales don't want anonymity... they want to know if someone is playing against them so they can do their own pressuring... and that's why they want to trace the dollars...

Then, what u can do is short bitcoin with half ur money... and don't use leverage...

My point was, the buy and hold strategy is not a bad idea if proposed and executed with a good trading trading plan... 
So ill make a case for a buy and hold strat... 
Ill buy bitcoin for fundamental reasons... what's the % of that from suceeding? Let's say 50%?... 
What's the risk reward ratio? ... if I'm right,.. I could easily triple my investment, with a net of 2:1 risk reward ration.. 
With the risk of 50% win... half the time I win, half I lose... when I lose, I lose 100% of my investment, when I win, I win 300%...that leaves me a profit of 200%...
Hence, buy and hold is a profitable play...
My point is.. its the plan that dictates if its a good play or not, and not so much on the when to buy and when to exit...

If you understand bitcoin, u start to question the term "cashing out"... what do you mean by cashing out if it has the potential to become a global currency? Are you trying to say u want to exchange a superior currency to an inferior one? That doesn't sound smart...
Thing is, people still think that bitcoin works like a stock or bond, its not people...
My advice, if you don't need the money and you have little idea how trading works.. just don't sell...
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:54:25
Lols, theoretically, you can crack a bitcoin wallet, but the resources u need to brute force it is so immense, its impossible to do it in a practical sense... 
Basically,  
Theoretically - yes, it not immune
Practically - no, its immune

I'm more leaning towards halving for the explanation of btc's rise...
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:38:07
Let's be real here though... until 2nd layer is fully adopted and integrated, its hard to see bitcoin going very high...
Even at 20k, people were paying $20 for a transaction, which drastically reduces its use to store-of-value or for huge transactions... which means it will deter people from getting it and using it... which means that most people at 20k price range are speculators waiting for someone to buy it from them. Specuators are not good if u want a stable growth... mostly, they are only good for pump and dumps...
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:37:02
Ur missing the point... the point is that it doesn't mean that it will last forever, we will be using it forever.. 
Like ur pyramids, are we still using it for its original purpose? Which is I'm not sure what it is, but I don't think its primarily used for tourist attraction...
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:19:31
Its hard to explain... but its a price movement that tends to be difficult to trade (personally)... in forex, which is a very liquid and mature market, price jerkiness is less rampant and intraday trends are less subject to whipsaws... on the downside, spot forex have spreads which kills ur profitability as spreads represent a large portion of ur target and stop loss
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:36:24
Again... another wrong assumption... it was not abandoned because it didn't function... it was governments enforcing fiat because it was "alchemy" for them, allowing govt the power to seemingly make a worthless paper turn into something valuable... 
But the markets soon catches up, which is why NO fiat currency has survived more than 200-300 years... This a historical FACT...
Now compare that to gold-backed economies which spanned for millennias before govts had their bright idea... and with a straight face, tell me that govt backed currencies are better...

If the money is not huge to the point of worrisome, get a wallet that can do multisig.. meaning it needs approval of two "wallet owners" for transactions to go through... set one up for your phone, and another for your pc.. hackers must hack ur phone and pc to get your coins, which makes it more difficult. Been using copay wallet for this.. 
If its big enough to be worrisome, get a cold storage... careful though, u need to create a new wallet in your cold storage and don't use the default one as stories of hackers able to access the default wallet exists...

1. Banks can work on top of bitcoin. Its the central banks that will lose power.
2. Fractional reserve has its advantages. Its best that u think in terms of pros and cons rather than this is superior and that one is inferior.
For example, using hard money to grow the economy is incredibly slow. To make it simpler to understand, its like growing a business with only what u have vs. Growing a business via the use of taking a loan cos that's what fractional is basically doing. It tries to take a debt, taking more risk with the possible of faster growth.
Keep in mind that I'm not siding fractional reserve nor do I take sides... I see each has its pros and cons, and it depends on the situation what tool is best to use... 
for now, I believe bitcoin is needed to counterbalance the reckless behavior of central banks, which seems to me that they can just do anything they want and let the people suffer for their mistakes...

@_date: 2018-06-27 17:23:41
Lols... "value" is the achilles heel of ur argument... 
The term "value" has different meaning to everyone... 
In my view, bitcoin's use as a currency is not yet the big thing, but I'm betting it will.. thus bitcoin has value to me...
Some would say its already being used as currency in some countries. Hence, ur assumption is inaccurate to a certain degree...
Btw, an app that puts stupid dog ears on your face is valued at billions...lols, don't tell me that's more valuable than an immutable ledger...

It can't be stolen, u just lose access to ur coin... 
If your thinking of tracing the paper trail, then there are tumblers that mix the coins and tracing would be extremely difficult...
Or, you could open a monero account, buy monero coins with stolen bitcoin, send the monero coin to ur other wallet, and buy bitcoin again... now that's near impossible to trace...

But if ur asking the govt to switch to bitcoin, I'm afraid that's in the realms of a good dream, that will most likely stay a dream... 
Furthermore, a well-run fiat can grow faster than a mature flatting bitcoin... basically, fiat and bitcoin has their own pros and cons. If there are still pros to running fiat, you can bet your ass govt won't let it go..

I've been telling this since I got on bitcoin... its in the interest for the rich for bitcoin to survive cos if you really think about, who has more need for protection of value...
Bill gates with gazillions? 
 
Or 
Bob that has $419 on his bank
Yes, there are rich people who are trying to shut down bitcoin as it goes against their investments (looking at you warren buffet).. 
But there's also rich people who want it to survive for protection purposes... hence, bitcoin is hard to put down...

Honestly, I get it.. been trading for years... there's a point in your evaluation that your so bombarded with opposing points that you go "f*ck it" ... ill believe on this blindly.. 
Then they start to create confirmation bias, and talk with confirmation bias and even debate with confirmation bias...
Essentially, they want to plug that part so they don't have to internally debat with themselves with "what if I'm wrong"... 
As a trader, this is dangerous... how do I deal with it? U have to train ur mind to be comfortable with uncertainty... 
My advice, if your not willing to tackle the mental ang psychological aspect of trading.. 
Then buy, hold it for 10+ year, and forget about the price till then. In fact, its better u forget it ever existed.. Don't attempt to go in and out... 
P.s. Not directly talking to you but more on anyone who's reading...
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:39:44
That's my point..  what happens when you dump and suddely a whale eats the volume you dumped? The price doesn't drop... in fach, it will create a rejection bar on the chart, which may even entice others to buy more as there are traders that uses rejection bars as trigger for entry... 
My point is, a dump will only suceed at dropping the price if there no one to absorb the volume you dropped...
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:27:17
If you mean btc as a pump and dump in the long run, I doubt that cos it has it has legit unique use cases...
If you talk about short term pump and dumps, then yeah, btc is still susceptible to that cos of its relatively smaller cap...

Huge is an understatement when bitcoin is still capping at billions when gold (the closest thing we can compare it) is capped at 2-3 trillions...

@_date: 2019-06-23 18:30:13
Think of it like this.. when u use paypal to transfer money, u pay them for transaction fees... except in this formula, u have to trust paypal to do their thing...
With bitcoin, ur paying miners to process the transaction, and there's no need for "blind trust" as everyone has a ledger that keeps everyone honests...
For now, processing the transaction will produce new coins... with bitcoin, it will eventually stop, and miners will only get paid with bitcoin that's already in circulation...
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:34:14
I'm pointing out to another trait... believing they are 100% right on the grounds of evidence that's speculative and hefty use of circular logic...
Case in point.. 
Me: do you believe that 100% bitcoin will be the only winning coin?
Bitcoin maximalist (bm) : absolutely
Me: based on what?
Bm: because of blah blah blah...
Me: do you realize that ur talking about the future, and that means no one is 100% certain, and yet you believe 100% u are right.. 
Bm: blah blah blah... makes circular logic like religion, and continues to bla blah blah...

Cos u need speculation before stability... would you buy a property in a war torn town? No, right?
But someone else is speculating that the town may change, so he invests in it... then more investors come, so on and so forth... now enough people is invested that its in their interest to keep the town safe and stabilized so non speculators come and buy their property..

Jeeeeeesus!... a ponzi scheme is not the same as "buying and hoping someone buys it for a higher price"...

theoretically, if no one mines, transactions won't be processed...
But your chances of dying from a meteor impact are higher than all miners leaving bitcoin because of its incentive system...
Hence, if you want to simplify an argument by saying "bitcoin will die if no one mines it" then the phrase is technically not a lie...
But for that to happen, as I said, u have bettr chances of dying from a meteor impact...
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:25:30
I second this... my guess is we need a free market system but enough socialism so people on the bottom of the ladder are not dyng of hunger and havo access to basic requirements for life...
I used to be a heavy free market believer, but if your neigbor is dying of hunger, guess who's house is he going to break in..  and if enough people are like that, youll have a civilization collapse...
My guess, make it a free market, and make that system support a socialist program as much as possible without breaking the free market system's back...

Markets is just a reflection of sentiments of the investors/traders... and how can u be so sure that u gravity can't have an effect looking at it macroscopically...
Even then, through my years in trading, I've seen far more ridic methods than this, but if they can make money out of it, who am I to tell them their method is wrong
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:21:03
Uhmmm...cos prices don't follow metrics, its the other way around... if metrics is a predictor of price, then what u have is a crystal ball...
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:30:33
the problem with this "reports" is the myopic view of the market... they say the 50-200 ma cross will make it bearish... but at what timeframe!? that's the real problem with these news, they say bear / bull but with no timeframe... I bet that the 50/200 is bullish on weekly and monthly timeframe... its perhaps the daily timeframe that's looking bearish... monthly = bull, weekly = bull, daily = possible bear... so what's the trend now? ... as I said, trends are relative...
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:46:43
That's why I don't attack trading beliefs of other people so I won't be in ur position, a position that's tough to defend with any conclusive evidence... if u think there's statistical evidence in the markets, then statisticians would be rich.. 
bottom line, were all running on assumptions and beliefs about the markets... 
Now u realize why experienced traders always have the position of .. "I don't believe on that, but If their making money, who am I to argue." To avoid being in a position that's exactly where u are right now
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:49:52
And u know? We have different opinions and beliefs of the market...
I can give u my opinion on why btc still have huge room for growth.. but since ur attacking using that angle, ill assume u have an opposite opinion... but here's the bottom line...
Since were talking about the future, were all running on assumptions here... and where putting money behind our assumptions... only time will tell who's right...
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:02:52
Lols, these times are good entry points... that means selling when its a good entry area is backwards thinking..

I personally trade (prolly gonna close 10% this month)... tried running a fund, not doing that ever again... perhaps maybe with close friends and family...
Hopefully, u have ur own bot that u came up with... cos if u bought it, good luck with that..
Personally, I doubt a bot can profitably trade the markets... u simply need human creativity to distinguish which information is valuable and which is not...

Ur argument has merits... but its on assumption that US holds majority of BTC volume...

Been trading for years in forex.. here's the thing with HODL...this is just an opinion (like most things are in trading and investing), HODL is a good idea for bitcoin, but rarely for anything else... the reason behind this is because of the technological, social and economic revolution its poised to bring... 
People here that disagree with the HODL idea comes from stocks or other markets that only see bitcoin as another medium to be traded... and not fully see its potential...
TLDR : a big portion of my portfolio is on HODL.. a few portion I trade... hodl rarely applies to anything else...

Been trading for years (mostly in forex), and when I hit that buy or short button, I already know when to exit when the prices goes or against me.. till any of my stop loss or profit target happens, I consider the trade as the "coin is in the air", and its best u don't meddle with it...
Most new traders come and just click the buy button with no plans of what the exit looks like.. to me, its the biggest cause of being emotional in the markets...
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:15:26
That's the bet here.. I think ur wrong and I'm betting on the other side... for now, the coin is in the air...

Lols, running a fund is one of the stressful things u can do... the prestige, status, or other ego-boosting is not worth the headache IMO...
If u know how to make money in the markets, running a hedge fund is mostly for ego-boosting as u can slowly grind to millions and spare urself from all that crap...

Then by definition, its still an assumption and stop pushing it as if its as evidence...since ur desperate to make it as evidence and not an assumption, do the study and...

I could be wrong, but most people want to be rich cos they think it brings happiness... well, search for "the happiest man in the world" in google and read how he got the moniker... he's not rich. In fact, he's got no wife and kids (maybe that's why he's so happy lol).
But I'm not saying this as if I'm an anti-money... just cover ur basic needs and then some... the rest is just for show

Its prolly wasn't this thread, but my position was always been.. trends are relative and very subjective... and I agree, we don't see the charts the same way, u see bear on weekly, I see a flat... this is also the reason why I think that self-fulfilling prophecy of anti TA's are nonsense... everyone has a different way of looking at charts, and how can be a self-fulfilling prophecy then...

1st - u don't know that, that's an assumption, otherwise, link to ur study please... 2nd... its is even a loss with 1:1 risk/reward ratio... 
I already said those points, but ur bent on "teaching" so I am asking for credibility...
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:58:48

Link please...
And stop using null hypothesis as there's no consensus on what works or not works on the markets...

I also haven't done the numbers, but it seems that ur also too focused on the US' gdp... a better of picture would be, how much is bitcoin's cap by 2020 in relation to the world's gdp of 2020...
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:24:37
Poor comparison... berkshire has been around for since 1965... u have to wait for bitcoin to reach 50 yeas before u can "fairly" compare it to bitcoin...
And I'm saying this knowing berkshire average return is around 20%.. 
If u wanna compare bitcoin's first 10 years (or so) vs berkshire's first 10, let's not cos it won't be close...  
However, bitcoin started from price zero, berkshire didn't, and that will tilt the numbers...
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:43:57
A better question is - how long are u planning to hold ur bitcoin? 
If its in terms of weeks, forget trying to time the market unless ur trained to do it...
If ur planning to hold in years, this dip may very well look like a pothole on the side of a mountain (if btc suceeds.) That 1k-5k difference won't mean much...
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:45:36
Been trading for years, and I do use lagging indicators for a quick check of the trend..  but I never consider them to have predictive abilities... in fact, most lagging indicators that will tell u to "buy", ur likely far from getting an optimal risk reward ratio

U do realize a bank using blockchain is an inefficient solution? They can just use the traditional database... even if they use blockchain to "sync" with other banks, the issue still remains as is today, who will they trust to run their blockchain... I'm not so sure if bank A will trust bank B to run the blockchain if it involves bank A's money...

Yadda yadda yadda.. all I'm hearing is... I talk complicated but can't provide you with evidence on point 1...  point 2... show me the study then, if its so easy,  give me the link... anyone's link will suffice... 
Until then, u got nothing more than "beliefs", convincing urself as facts...
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:10:55
Lols, unless u can read charts pretty well... ur most likey going to buy around the ATH if u want to be assured that's its going to go up again... of course, after an ATH, the price drops again, then ull be selling it a loss if u can't hold...
Then the cycle repeats again while saying the mantra "buy low sell high"... 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:28:34
Ur comparing apples to oranges... stocks and cryptos have different "normal volatility"... I'm not sure how much is volatility of ur stock markets... but a 70% drop in cryptos is not uheard of...
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:48:55
The other side of the argument is - isn't there  an instance in the past that btc spiked, went to an ATH and google trends was late to pick up? ... if so, google trends is a lagging indicator... a predictive indicator is when google trends spiked first, then btc price follows... I'm not sure that happened in the past before, except maybe during the peak, when herd mentality as its highest,which it may be a good indicator of an upcoming dip...
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:55:23

Its actually possible for anything that can store data and not just bitcoin chain... images are just 1's and 0's at its very core... so essentially, u can code an image using emoji, (e.g. Sad face = 1 and smiley face = 0)
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:08:32
Then basically, there's no evidence... 
heres another idea that u probably throw to ur creationist friends...
The lack of evidence does not automatically make ur hypothesis true.. 
so why are u taking a stance of "so sure".. when the evidence is saying "we have no data on that" or "we don't know.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:23:17
Do u realize that the vast majority of computers runs on binary code? That means it needs just two data points... in our system, its 1 and 0... the ultimate point is, any two data points can work! Even a smiley face and sad face emoji as substitute 1 and 0!
Essentially, anything that can store data means u can store cp images... that's why this angle is not only ridiculous, but its a sign of desperation
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:20:13

U do realize that html is an ineffecient script, but here we are, most (if not all) websites are using html...

That's my point, its a bad assumption, with poor parameters, described using "scientific language" to make it sound scientific when its not...

The market prices moves in zig zags or swings... when the market trend turns, its usual for the zig zag or swing to display a head and shoulders pattern...

First of all, these are all guesswork cos we don't have clear numbers...
Also, if looked at a vacuum, ur point has merits...
Arguably, the more companies accepting bitcoin, the more people see its becoming more legit... this may fuel the demand,wich may offset the selling...
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:17:14
U must be equating fair to equal distribution of wealth...IMO, that's not the goal of bitcoin... bitcoin solves the "trust" issue of the equation... now, u trust central banks to run the system, but that also means they can do a lot of "magic" with ur money.. bitcoin aims to rid the central authority so all money is accountable...

Personally, id like to try that deflationary currency... as what I've know, there's no currency yet like bitcoin.. most of ur examples are inflationary currencies undergoing deflation, not designed to be deflationary in the first place...  my biggest irk with the current system is that printing money is simply stealing value that's already in the market and transferring it to the newly printed money that they call their "own"... then, they broadcast to the world that what they are doing is good cos it keeps the economy moving forward... sheesh... stealing,no matter how u sugarcoat it, is stealing...

Dude, I'm just going to point out that using candlestick patterns on crypto is less effective due to the fact there's no uniform open, high, low close...
In stocks in wich everything has a central collection of data... since crypto is a 24-hour business, ur open, high, low, close depends on the hour u start considering ur "open"

Trend is relative... in fact, everyone has a definition of what a trend is... do u use higher highs or higher lows? Even then, u also need to define what's ur criteria for a swing... if ur using two moving averages to define a trend, then everyone has their own criteria..  some us 7-14 ma, 15-30 and some 50-200... now add the issue that every time frame will plot different trends... the daily may be bear for 10-20, but the month is showing bull... get it!? trends are relative!

the problem with most people is they see TA as the magic bullet... its not, in fact, its only a tool so u can develop a systematic and unemotional trading system that u can execute with little guess work... without TA, its tricky to make a "trade system" ... for example, what are ur rules for buying? 
 
U answer: "I buy the dip" 
So how do u define a dip? ... if it drops 20%?, 50%?
If u say 50%..  that's fine, if u buy everytime the price dips 50%, then u have now a systematic way of getting into the market. U can execute the system with little guesswork.. 
In TA, some people like to get in if the price is 50% between the recent high and the support ... some use trendlines or whatever, but the most important thing is, with TA, u can create a system that u can stick to, day in and day out... its meant to avoid "feeling" ur entry, which highly susceptible to bias...
and that's what TA is all about.. its not a magic bullet or crystal ball...

I use TA for trades and I can tell u that hardly anyone can predict the markets accurately... there's one guy, george marechal, 80-90% forecasted the dow jones in the 1930's... how he did it died with him... 
The best use for TA in my
Opinion is to  help u to asses ur "risk" so u can size ur bets accordingly, AND it can help u maximize ur wins when ur right and minimize ur loss when ur wrong... 
If ur using TA and hoping to be accurate 80% of the time, then ur doing it wrong... in fact, a forex trader turned 10,000 to 100k in two years (fully documented his trade on an open platform for anyone to see) only managed to get 50%-60% accuracy...

First of all, I truly believe "we trade our beliefs".. having said that, I find it funny that people rave about elliot wave when the elliot died in an asylume and more importantly, died broke... its like a cripple teaching u how to run...
Also, the problem with elliot wave is tooooo much guesswork... show a chart to 10 elliot wave practioner and u get 10 different wave counts...
Also, I've looked enough charts that elliot wave seem to exist in the market.. but its hard to make money out of it cos u don't know which part of the wave u are.. but with benefit of hindsight, its easy to claim "here, it works"...

More like people are so obsessed with the minute prices... if ur buying bitcoin because u believe its implications, then u are largely doing fundamental trading... AND that means holding for months and years...
From a fundamentals perspective, the market is often "dumb"... in a strong bull market, legitimate negative news get ignored,.. in strong bear markets, even if lighting network is "officially" launched tomz, chancer are, it will get ingored and we'd still be dipping/flatting for a few days or even weeks...
But in the long run, prices stick the fundamentals... in other words, stop looking at the hourly or even daily prices of bitcoin.. in fact, check next year!

Stop Loss: goes to zero
Target Profit: until full adoption
Risk/reward ratio : 10(at least) to 1... this means for every dollar u bet, u can expect to win 10$... 
So even if u lose this bet, who cares, its a good bet.. in trading, give me an opportunity that gives me 10:1 and ill be betting all day long...

Lols, ur pretty new to this aren't ya? ... ok here's one important to learn about markets especially for the ones that have a strong upside bias, like crypto and stock markets...  there's a thing that we consider as coin mood and general market mood... when the general market mood is bad, most (close to 80%) of the stocks/coin can't make any gains... 
if u think this kind of thing only happens in crypto, ur mistaken...try going long on the stock markets when the dow jones and s&amp;p are on a bear market...the only difference is, in crypto, most are dependent on btc price while in stocks, its on dow jones and/or s&amp;p, which are composed of basket of stocks... I do admit because the crypto markets are dependent to 1 coin as opposed to a basket of coins, I consider it as not yet mature, which is a good and bad thing depending on how u play it

TA is like learning how to count cards in blackjack... when u learn how to card count, does that mean u win all ur hands? Of course not, but what it does is tilt the odds  to bring the % in ur favor...
Another thing, lot of people think that TA is the end all, be all...its not.. at best, its prolly just 30% of the game...discipline, money management and mental fortitude plays a big part in trading also..

I come from the forex markets and I usually recommend that newbs don't do intraday trading... in forex, there are 3
Major markets (us, london, japan).. each has its own time of the day, at some hours they overlap... the problem with intraday in markets like this is because each market has its own sentiment... japan could be bull, but london and us could be bearish...it causes chaos in the charts if ur not aware of it...
In crypto, the problem multiplies because u don't know who the major markets are and at what time they operate... 
As a general rule,the lower the timeframe, the more chaotic it gets...

Buying would cause the price to go up... even if u set it at low prices... u orders will quickly absorb the supply, causing the price to bounce... now u have two options, u allow the slippage and chase the price as it goes up or stick to ur price and risk of not get fully filled as the price might start going up when ur just 20% filled.. 
In case one, u just gave the prices a boost, might even cause a panic buying.. in case two, u gave bitcoin a strong support...
My point is, u can crash by selling, but u can't do it without raising the prices because of the whale's huge volume...

I'm very cautious when my broker wants mo to buy something...
personally, in my opinion, let the market handle its own thing.

Been trading for years.. support and resistance are relative... there are s&amp;p in the 1 minute timeframe as there are for 1 week.. of course, the higher the time frame, the stronger... 5k is the strong support of the weekly timeframe.. so I expect a reaction from the market at the very least...  also, everyone has a different way of defining s&amp;p...

u do realize that before u can buy bitcoin with usdt, someone has to be on the other side willing to sell... even though u have unlimited money in theory, its only a theory cos not everyone is going to accept usdt in exchange for bitcoin... while I do agree that usdt might be potentially a huge problem, but I'm not that worried simply because usdt is moslty used by short term traders, and 80% of short term traders lose money... the problem starts to be a real headache if more short term traders are making profits versus losing traders.. in such scenario, the operators will have to pull out money from their own pockets to keep the 1$ = 1 usdt

I'm just pointing out ur "dip" and "tanking"...I'm also saying, that 70% is normal cryptos that's why they call it a dip... I'm not familiar with ur stock market volatility, so if u say 20% drop in the stock markets is normal, call it a dip then...
But here's the thing, I believe that stock markets grow on average 10%-20% a year (correct me if I'm wrong) ...so a 20% drop is like a year's gain... 
Bitcoin drops 70%, but its yearly return on average is 2k% ... so that's hardly a year's gain...

I'm not sure, but I thinks there's a regulation that u can't buy stocks from startup companies as a retail investor... to do that, u have to be an accredited investor status before u can do that... u need to have a set amount of net worth, in which the average joe can't...
This is also why I don't like ico's being regulated... while its true that u can lose money, but its also where the astronomical gains are possible... its an Ulta high risk, ultra high reward game, but it can be played if u know how to do it...
 as an investor, its ur job to do research and learn the right exposure basing on ur risk assessment... relying on a "nanny" to do that for u will result to being excluded from ultra high gains (such as the regulation the op is talking about).. 
Although I admit there are ways to circumnavigate such regulation

A lot of new "investors" or traders focus too much on "when to buy", and leave it there... if u want to succeed in this game, u need a TRADING PLAN... and it includes when to buy, when to sell at a profit and when to sell at a loss... this can severely decrease ur "panic situations" as u already know what to do when the price goes with or against u...
In trading, I see discipline and consistency as the real edge, not some "magic indicator" or super sure entry signals...
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:43:58
The reason why people get panicky when bitcoin dips is because of the lack "reasons for buying"... if u buy bitcoin cos of FOMO, then prepared to get f*cked...
If u bought bitcoin because of u believe its features and its future implications... then u only need to check if those reasons still holds...if its still there,forget the price...  
For me, fundamentals are not only good, but its getting better with the growth of lightning network, so I couldn't care about the price really...
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:32:49
buying the dip is a sound advice if ur strategy is long term buy and hold (years in holding time)... what ur pertaining is trading in time frames of days to weeks., which requires a different set of parameters when it comes to buying and selling... long term trading (holding in years) is more based on fundamental analysis...
The problem with people is they think they are in for the long run, when the prices test them, they become swing traders...

Who said indexing is a strategy that won't lose money? ... I think ur the one who's looking for a pipe dream - an investment strategy that makes good money with no risk...
My point is, indexing is a safer cos ur essentially betting on the idea that the entire cryptocurrency market is going to grow... so tell me, which is more likey going to happen when it comes to worst case scenarios... bitcoin going away or cryptos going away? ... if ur sane, ud say that bitcoin is more likely going to fail than the entire cryptomarket, so u need a strategy that runs on that concept, and indexing is how u do it...
Can it lose money? Of course, duh, this is investing, nothing is guaranteed... but its a lot safer compared to betting on bitcoin, ether or whatevercoin...
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:40:39
what ur saying is... that's ur paradigm of trading... not mine... if u want to be technical, yes its not a stop loss in technical terms, but to me, stop loss is how ur willing to lose... so bitcoin can to zero and my bet proposition is still good... 
from what ur telling me, ur a short term trader (holding positions in days or weeks) or an intraday trader..  both have huge emphasis on tight stop losses... but understand that not all "traders" act on ur time frame... 
For my bitcoin and the strategy I'm employing for it is a buy and hold, either it gets to zero or my exit is hit... 
And here's the value proposition.. if I'm wrong, ill just lose 100% of my bet, and if I'm right, r could be making 100% - 1000% or more as were veeeeeerrry far from full adoption... 
My risk reward ratio for this bet is 1 : 1 - 100, with a good win %... ill take these kinds of bet all day long...
Btw, I also do swing trading on a portion of my portfolio... I know what u mean by stop losses.. in fact, I came from the forex markets in which stop losses are paramount because of the leveraged nature of the forex markets... 
this bitcoin bet is just a part of the portfolio and it runs on a different bet proposition... for this bet, the coin is already in the air and I'm now waiting for the results..

 by my guess, I can estimate ur new to the markets... been in the markets since 2009, and in my experience...  the only people who are sure that their method or philosophy is the only thing that works is a) new to the markets who haven't tried a downrun with their method, or b) trying to sell something...
The profitable ones I know usually, if not all, comes with a stand of ... "I don't believe on that method, but if they are making money, who am I to argue."

Basing ur term "free fall" because u lost $400 is naive...  everything in the market is relative...
If ur capital was $1000 and u lost $400 in under a week, yeah, u can call it a free fall...
But if ur initial capital is $10,000 that $400 is not a free fall by most definition...
And even if u base ur definition to percentage... a 5% dip in hours in bitcoin is far from being "free fall"...

Cos this is the bitcoin subs...this is not a public forum that all walks of life come together...
So the question now becomes.  If u hate bitcoin, why would u even be here? Potential answers:
* paid shill
* looking for arguments to feel relevant
* someone with messiah complex, thinking its his responsibility to prevent the forum from becoming an echo chamber.
Given that we don't know anyone here, thus we don't know what they really are like behind the monitor... a paid shill is likely the answer percentagewise...

Its clearly u have biased against trading because it does not fit to ur perception of value creation... 
Trading involves risk and time, both have value... but hey, as u said, u do u, ill do me...
Btw, successful trading can't be done by anyone because of the demands of the profession. Frankly, it will drive u crazy if ur not built for it... in essence, it has value cos it can produce money and not everyone can successfully do it... why do u think hedge managers are paid so much? Yep, cos u can't do what they can.. 
much like ur profession... unless ur flipping burgers, which everyone can do and that's why the pay is so little...

The frequency is up to u... fees are an issue and thats why doing it more often isn't recommended... 
If ur doing sort of indexing (buying the top 10 coins), it won't make money during a bear market... indexing just mimics the performance of the crypto market... but in fairness, unless u short, even trading barely makes money in a bear

it depends on how u define "new"... the first solid evidence of fiat was back in 1500's - 1600's... marco polo defined it as the secret to "alchemy" when he witnessed it when traveling across china...
So yeah, for millenias, gold retained its value, while on the other hand, no fiat has lasted more than 200 years...
Thankfully, calling gold standard "stupid" is just ur opinion... 
gold standard has its flaws, but this fiat system is like a communist idea.. it looks good on theory, but fails to deliver in the real world and the countless fiat that went to zero and none lasting more than 200 years supports this argument...

Its my conclusion that humanity eventually adopted gold as currency not because its "shiny"... but a process of elimination...
Gold is the only element that has a distinct color (easy to identify), not too common, not too rare, and rarely reacts to anything...
However, these reasons holds true in the past were "physical" dominate the everyday lives.. 
But in this new paradigm of information, such reasons don't have a lot of weight anymore... hence, that also brings down the importance of gold...

Yeah... just so u know... u just triggered my "paid shill" alert... saying "central banks is a good invention" is already a red flag as the trust in banks is in all time low... chances are, a paid shill would say something like that...
Look, currencies doesn't need to have "intrinsic value" to function... but lets look at the facts here.. 
Historical FACTS:
*Gold served as a good currency prior to fiat, and still has value to this day..
* N0 fiat has lasted more than 200 years... 
At the very least, u can say fiat is an ongoing experiment that still has a high failure rate...
At the worst, its one of those "good on paper idea, terribly fails in the real world"...
Saying it's the best idea in the world... well,ur either trolling, paid shill, bitter excoiner or extremely biased toward central banks...

Normally, I don't engage entrenched people cos its pointless... but maybe this will turn out a good conversation...
U have a lot of assumptions really... but ill single one out...
Monetary policies as u said, correct me if wrong, creates order...mind u, this is not economic policy... 
currency will know how to settle itself, if it can do that on its own (gold served as good currency for millenias). hence, if it can settle on its own, it seems monetary policies can't justify its cons... which is corruption...
Another one is crypto creating chaos.. that's just unfounded...

Nice hypothetical scenario, except ur example conveniently fits ur narrative... first of all, 2 coins is not an "industry", "market", or "sector",.. thus, u can't index. What are u doing an index of 1 coin? That's stupid.. an index mimics or represents the growth rate of a sector, market or category... so no, ur example is a fail...
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:13:38
part of issue why ur not having a good grasp is because u have no inner workings on how index is suppose to be done... the idea of indexing is not betting on the growth of one or two couple of coins to avoid being married to a trade... in this context, its betting on the growth of the entire crypto market... 
So lets say, if I do top 10 based on cap... u think the winning coin will start from top 100 then on top 1 the next day? It has go through the top 10 first... if I rebalance twice a month or monthly, I'm pretty sure I can catch some of its growth while its going to the top... 
on the otherside, u think bitcoin will be top 1 then the next day top 100? It doesn't work that way unless ur bitconnect... so its likely its a slow downfall, which is okay as other coins will hold their value while other gain some to offset bitcoin's loss...
Tldr: indexing is a lot safer compared to picking bitcoin, ether or whatever as its a bet that the entire market grows and not on a specific coin...

Rebalancing is risk mitigation in exchange for growth... Ill ask u? 
Which is more likely going to happen:
A: bitcoin goes to zero
B: the entire crypto market goes to zero
If ur smart, then ur answer is B.
So u need a system that bets on the crypto market, and not bitcoin only... u achieve that by sort of indexing, which is I assume what ur doing cos rebalancing is a thing for such strategy.
By rebalancing, u stay on track on betting the crypto market... if u don't rebalance, some coins will own a significant portion of ur portfolio that its starting to go towards betting on each coin rather than the crypt markets
There's no "correct" way of rebalancing... its really up to u... the point is just be consistent with ur rebalancing method (weekly, monthy, yearly).

Here's the thing, people with money are more interested in protecting their wealth than growth...

In time, maybe the lower guys can convince the top guys.. but I don't see it happening in 5 years... the top guys are usually old, they don't understand btc

I agree on this one... I see bitcoin as the currency that will keep the government's central bank in check... 
at this current setup, we rely on central banks to do the "stimulating of the economy".. but if they f*ck up, its the people who pays for it... 
With bitcoin, they better not do anything stupid and do a far better job, or else competition...
I love the idea of btc replacing all fiat, but I'm afraid that governments will have a hard time swallowing that... 
Govt have the option of using only accepting their fiat if u pay them or receive from them... hence, I think fiat will have a place in the future..  but it won't be as dominating as now...

Don't get hung up on "intrinsic value"... at this point, "intrinsic value" is a near pointless considering that most valued things are in digital form...
Bottom line, Value is value... assigning "intrinsic" dosnt make it magically better... 
Case in point, gold has intrinsic value because it can be used in electronics...but how much of its current value is valued for electronics?
Let's say 20%? 
So what are u gonna do? Wait for gold to drop to 20%, before u buy?.. you could be waiting forever...  
so u buy now and feel safe that at least 20% of its value will hold? ... why not just let it go when it dips 50%, and buy a different investment?
That's why, "intrinsic value" is near pointless as it has no practical importance...

I trade the markets, nothing works 100% of the time... hence, can u say if it only works 60-70% of the time as something "true"?
... there's a reason why economics is not yet considered a science and this one of the reasons... and not some leftist/rightist propaganda...
Hard science relies on testing and duplicatable results...I agree there are certain parts of economics that holds true, like supply and demand... but that's only a small part of it...
Economics has blossomed to theories that are mostly untested... and now, economics has more untested theories than tested ones.. which is why I said...
Its more of a theology than science...

U seem to forgot the part of "in the long run"
...I swing trade, and I do short bitcoin and hold it in days/weeks.

U have to realize that economics is largely subjective, as everyone has different way of valuing things...if u say bitcoin is not a commodity, the futures market disagrees with u...

Yeah... I have no doubt that they run operations without legislations... my point was someone has to approve "bitcoin operation", and the one doing that is usually old...

I've dipped my feet in trading since 2009, and haven't met anything like bitcoin in which the risk:reward ratio is astronomically huge...its one of those trading opportunities that prolly happens once in 20-30 years? And when such things happens, an "all in" is a reasonable call..

I know ur point, but it doesn't really make a difference when u start comparing...
In the comparison.. real estate lost 70% value... real estate only grow historically by 5%-10%, which means it take at least 7 years to recover...
In bitcoin, wich can grow 300% per year on average, bitcoin can recover in less than a year...
Less than a year versus 7 years... calling the real estate a crash is valid...
I think ur confused because of the word "crash" and how u define it... crash and dip are subjective terms, everyone has a different way of defining those terms...
But hey, if u want to consider anything that drops 50% as crash and not considering its possible recovery rate just so u can categorically say "bitcoin crashed"...feel free to do so... 
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:26:37

Cloud mining isn't really a scam, but its more of an idiotic investment.. yes, it makes u money, but if u compare that to buying holding, that's what u call an "opportunity loss".

If he's renting it out to u, he knows for sure that he can make MORE money off from u than mining on his own...

Its likely true that shorters got wrecked yesterday (from our timezone)... shorters are mostly traders, and most traders will know basic pattern formations... 
For a couple of weeks, bitcoin formed a "bear flag"... once the bear spot the pattern, they take their positions, hoping to cash in when it breaks out... but it turned out to be a failed bear flag... 
Now, the shorters are holding a busted bear flag and forced to close... which means high liquidity for bull whales to buy.
(always remember, whales have problems with liquidity because of their huge orders... which is the reason why they try to "stop loss hunt" or what u call shaking out the weak hands so they will sell, and increases liquidity so they can got their orders filled)
the increase of volume together with the surge indicates heavy buying... here's another point.. 
A number of the top 20's are already turning short term bull... the last time bitcoin went from 7k to 12k, before dipping again, all of the top 20's were running short term bear... 
All in all, I'm 50% sure were at the bottom.. still waiting a few more confirmations before going 100% bullish...

Yeah, we tried to arb the exchange.. but there was no way to exit the money unless ur in korea or have a friend there... 
The cause of the inefficiency is because u can only exit it korean won, which u need to be in korea so u can exchange it back in usd...
Because of this ineffeciency, the korean prices can't stabilize with the rest of the world

If ur asking that, u still don't get the core purpose of bitcoin... the idea is to hodl bitcoin forever and use it as currency... theres no "cashing out"... unless if the other party does not accept btc.. then just exchange fiat in small amounts, but not something that is considered as "cashing out"

And my point still stands that its a semantics game.. if that's how u define fiat, feel free to do so... couldn't care how u label bitcoin...
and please stop referring an authority figure to boost ur stance as economics is more of theology than science... 
hence, any authority figure in economics is just like the pope.. he gains more credibility and power as more people believe he's right...

Let's assume its the feds, its kinda pointless also... that wallet is the most watched in the planet... once they start moving that, the world would take notice... so its either u dump it on one go, or do a slow liquidation.. 
If u dump it, price drastically drops... yeah, u made some profit, but don't think in terms of trillions...
Slowly? Can't do that, as I said most watched without triggering lots of ringing a lot of bells...

First of all, its very hard to crash markets if its not bloated in the first place...
most people hate soros as he's known to be a shorter of economies... personally, shorters have a place in the markets...they may cause a "crash", but allowing "bubbles" to continually grow until breaking points will be even more catastrophic...
What soros usually do is dig around a currency or economy, he the looks for something fishy... if he can find one, he shorts then exposes the proplem,and profits from the short... 
Since he needs to go on public and do the exposure... he often gets blamed.. 
Soros is a cut throat and unemotional trader... and that's why he's good at the game...
If u think trading is a friendy game with people holding hands singing kumbaya... then ur in the wrong business...

playing on the casino is not gambling to me, its utter stupidity as u have negative expected value... when it comes to trading, if u become good at it, then ur expected value becomes positive.. same idea as playing texas holdem...
Gambling is often a word thrown by lazy people, giving themselves an excuse not to learn, while hiding behind the veil of self-righteousness...

There are more untested theories versus tested theories... 
The balance is so tilted, which is why its not considered as a science yet...
If 90% of the biologist says its a fact, Ill believe its a fact..  but that "fact" is not as hard as compared to "theory of gravity" which can be tested and duplicated...

I disagree... there are games that bots can do good, I don't see they can be good at trading... the problem with bots they are too rigid, and the game has too many variables... also, if u do trading analysis, u'll need to know when to disregard or adjust information, u generally do that by intuition.. bots cant do that... unless u can teach a bot to be creative or intuitive
Bots are usually good at games where all information is there on the table like chinese go and chess... they are also good when the moves or bets are fixed... 
its the reason why there are no bots that can beat the game no limit texas holdem at a professional level... the no limit part of the betting explodes the variable too much...

Its better to that bitcoin trading and bitcoin futures trading as separate markets... futures trading are usually settled in cash, and that means they don't have to buy bitcoin to cover their positions...
Shorters who got rekt yesterday traded on the actual crypto market, and that means they have to buy to close their short position.. shorting via futures is different and it generally doesn't affect the price of bitcoin as its just a contract, more like a "bet contract" that says the price will go down... there are people on the other side who thinks the other guy is wrong so hell take the bet...

Ur looking at the markets at a retail investor's perspective... look at it from the perspective of whales, which are the market movers...
As a whale, u can't click a button and expect to get filled without affecting price... whales ALWAYS have to deal with price slippage or not getting filled...
So how do solve that? By triggering stop losses to increase liquidity... more liquidity means whales can have their orders filled without causing too much slippage.. 
So what u call manipulation, is more of a whale trying to solve a liquidity problem...

The way I see it.. at the time, the price was soaring and more and more people are becoming aware of its glaring scaling problem, which can be seen as a big hurdle to adoption... 
If they had succeeded, then it could have accelerated bitcoin's adoption and preserved it price... 
.. but there's also the problem of missed catastrophic bugs that renders the network useless...
The other route was what were seeing now, bitcoin got too much attention, soared to new highs and the markets realized its intended use as a currency is not worth the price (mainly high transac fees and long processing times) thus the crash... which may mean months (or years) to recover... personally, without a catalyst like the lightning network, it may take years or never at all...people losing money leaves a bad taste...
We took the route of securing the network first but delaying adoption and possibly scaring off adopters (took few years before wall street started touching tech companies after the bubble)... 
If the other route succeeded, then we could have faster adoption with better bitcoin price
Personally, it was a tough call.. and I could have gone either way.. I trust the developers, so I support their decision...
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:38:27

Personally, I can observe the elliot wave happens in the markets... the problem is, its only good in hindsight.. as ur trading, ur main problem with it is u don't know where u are in the wave counting... and good luck with it in flat markets
Bottom line... elliot wave may happen in the market, but profiting from it is an entirely different story

Here's the thing with markets.. its made up of buyers and sellers... just like when u haggle at the flea market, the price tries to settle at the "equilibrium price" ... here's why a pullback is "healthy"...
When the price shoots up way too fast, its deviating too far from the equilibrium price... keep in mind that prices will eventually has to return to the equilibrium price...
But since it deviated too far, when it drops back down, it will overshoot the equilibrium price... 
A pullback is then healthy as it stabilizes the growth....

Lols, I used to play online poker for a living, and I now trade for and crypto... in all honesty, there's no big difference between the two... 
Poker takes a lot of guesstimating the value of ur hands against against the opponent, and on top of that, u have to guesstimate the behavior of the opponent when u do this and that...
Trading is the same in a way u have to guesstimate what the market will do...
Id say trading is better as u have the ability to control ur risk reward ratio easier... with poker, can u bet 33$ in a 100$ pot (to get a 1:2
Risk reward ratio), and expect the  opponent to fold? The answer may be a yes but the opponent needs to be very ultra tight... as no one in the right mind would fold to that bet as even hand with two overcards are getting good odds...
Trading, I can bet right now and set my target for a 2:1...

The term "short squeeze" has slightly different meanings to traders...  I believe, what happened was shorters simply lost their bet... 
The "short squeeze" that hedge fund managers are scared of is a different scenario..  its when u do a "naked short"... its when u sell the stock, without owning it first... which means when u close the position, u have to buy the stock first, to cover ur position...
The problem with the naked short is when the shorter makes a huge volume short sell, and the price goes up... now, he has to buy to close the position... the "short squeeze" happens when there's no enough volume in the market to buy in order to close ur position...

Some brokers will allow shorting as the brokers will facilitate the "borrowing."
For example, in poloniex, btc holders have the option of allowing their btc to be "locked in" for a certain time period, and in return, they get interest...

My trader side doesn't really care if bitcoin lives on or will be replaced... I'm invested in crypto's and my portfolio has mechanisms to take advantage if other coin replaces bitcoin... 
nevertheless, I come from a marketing background and being first on the minds of people (not necessarily the first on the market) comes with a huge advantage... its just how the human mind works.. 
most people know the first man on the moon, but there'll be fewer who'll know the second... the myspace, altavista argument is flawed because internet is a global thing and those two were never known nor popular in our side of the planet... 
also, I'm not saying 2nd placers will never beat  but historically, the odds of that happening is lower... so why bet against the house when u have the choice? If u wanna be safe, then just hedge ur bets...
All in all, crypto has two solutions 1) make a better coin 2) fix the problem of the first coin... because of the point I mentioned above, I'm leaning on the 2nd solution to win simply because its the "house" at the moment..

Since we are talking about specific future problems, we're now in speculative land, so no one knows exactly how this will turn out... but opinionwise...
Chinese mining domination is dwindling, and it would seem counter intuitive for them to do something that could harm btc's reputation as that like slaying the cow that provides milk... 
the argument that they may be doing it shill for another coin, ur giving the miners the option of future bigger profits IF they succeed vs getting decent money now.. that proposition can't easily take hold the majority.
For electricity, yes, it may be a big problem..  but human greed will always be a problem also.. even if u "ban" it, there's always a country that welcomes it.. even then, enforcing is another problem...

Ultimately, the band aid solution was leaning towards supporting bitcoin's rapid price growth as the high fees and long transaction times was becoming a huge problem for further growth, which may become a hurdle for adoption...

Btw, Soros takes long positions all the time, he's just famous for his shorts...

Centralized blockchain is kinda stupid... just use a the traditional database, its faster and efficient... blockchains are notoriously hard to scale, but that's the price we are willing to pay for decentralization...
Btw,spare me to debate of "bitcoin/lightning network is decentralized"... decentralization/decentralization come in gradients... as long as there's no  group of people or someone that can do "magic manipulation" on the ledger, I'm good...

I think, the only predictive use of google trends is looking out for an impending crash during an uptrend, while looking for a buy on dip/crash...
U prolly heard the saying "buy when there's blood on the streets" or "be fearful when everyone is hopeful"... but how do u exactly turn that into a trading specifics.. an idea of mine is using google trends...
When google trends start to go way above bitcoin's price,then we may consider the "herd" in hopeful mode... so start tightening up stop losses... 
When google trends drops way below the price, perhaps the herd is fearful, start buying...

Generally, middle class are the working class + debt.. the lower class are working class with no debt... the upper class are businessmen...
Since the feds keep printing money and diluting the value pool, the middle class have a very difficult way of saving to a better life, especially considering they have staggering amounts of bad debt...
The upper class doesn't get fucked that much as they have ways to "outrun" the inflation rate... 
since its hard to outrun the inflation by saving plus with the bad debt, the middle class is disappearing...

@_date: 2018-04-21 12:11:33

Yeah, cos apple is being traded on a worldwide market... let me guess, ur an american? U people often make the mistake of assuming that everything runs on ur country... 
Here's another example.. why should I use bitcoin when visa/mastercard can reverse transactions... stop assuming the rest of the world behaves like that... in fact, at least 50% of the planet don't have access to privileged banking and I'm being generous here.. 
Here's another.. bitcoin will rise after tax season... its a mistake in assuming that US holds the majority of the bitcoin volume...

I really don't want to be the party pooper and I'm a bitcoin supporter, I'm not feeling too good with this recent push because the market is not behind the rally...
Basically, only btc and eth are showing strength. Generally, when this happens, the market is poisting for a major dump... 
Btw, I just went long on bitcoin 2-3 weeks ago, and its still going... I'm just not too excited about it though...
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:24:12
in trading speed is important, and I say vague as by the time ur trigger hits u, bitcoin is prolly in the gutter...
And if ur setting triggers that won't happen, then why bother?... that's like believing in a god, and trying to justify it using "scientific terms... 
that seems to be like a man who doesn't want to be wrong, rather than trying to find what could go wrong and what's the best way to prepare for it...

Uhmm... u replied to the wrong thread? I never mentioned cme participating on their own order book...

Lols, these kinds of videos are just blurring lines using technical classification or terminologies... from a philosophical sense a dollar, euro, bitcoin, cigarettes are assets that can be used as medium of exchange... labeling it with fancy terminologies don't change anything in a practical sense...
I would say that bitcoin is perhaps the purest form of "medium of exchange" as there are no rules and regulations that are artificially hindering its "value finding" mechanism...
All fiat currencies, in different levels, are artificially valued (some are more than others)... an arguement could be made that this will increase stability... but don't make the mistake of thinking its completely safe...
Its similar to a calm river with a massive damn behind.. the damn is artificially creating calm waters, but if that damn break, all hell breaks loose.. similarly, when a govt behind a currency makes a fatal mistake, then don't expect a calm and orderly decline...

@_date: 2018-12-11 12:34:58
It matters because there are plenty of delusional people here that think bitcoin is the only coin that should survive...
Its like a religion really... "my god is better than ur god" kind of thing...

The problem with new traders and investors is they only see the $$$... and when it goes down, they all cry...
Been trading for years, and ur not suppose approach the market that way... what ur suppose to do is think of risk:reward ratio...
Can u realistically kill bitcoin? The smart answer is likely "no"... 
That means if u buy $1k now, ull hardly lose it all...
For the upside, buying it now can easily make u $4k from ur $1k as that's not new territory, hence less hesitation...
Maybe you'll understand it better this way.. 
Find a championship match between two parties whether its boxing, basketball, football or baseball... give me 4:1 odds and take ur bet blindly even I have no idea what the game is all about..
No bookie will ever give u those odds for a championship game, and here u are whining...
@_date: 2019-05-13 04:09:17

Sorry, I got no time to watch a video...but it doesn't take a genius that if u make a new wallet and do it the right way, it can never be linked to you.. 
If u want bitcoin to be like monero, most likely it will never gonna happen on the main chain...

Binary options IMO is one of the biggest scams out there disguised as "investing"...
Been trading for years, and one of the rules i adopted is never trade with an inverted risk:reward ratio... 
This means, if u bet 1$, u should at least get a net of 1$ or better... 
With 1:1 risk-reward ration, u breakeven if u have 50% win rate (excluding fees)..
With binary options, u get .70 - .80 cents per 1 dollar u bet... 
Now I ask u, can u predict the market more than 50% to offset that defecit?
Keep in mind that if u can get up to 60% -70% win rate, ur already considered as a rockstar in the trading world...
Aaaaanndd these people are only trying to solve the direction...
With binary options, u will have to solve the direction within a certain timeframe... that multiplies the difficulty many times over...
Bottom line, binary options is like betting on the underdog without the better odds...biggest scam in the world imo.. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:04:01
And that's my point, just because I don't buy pivx or other coins, I'm not going to say they are crap...  
Honestly, I'm a supporter of bitcoin, but this bitcoin maximalist sh*t makes me wanna distance from this community..  I purposely got out of religion cos IMO, this idea of "my god is better than ur god" is childish and ignorant... 
But here I am, dealing with "my coin is better than ur coin"...
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:35:34
The only evidence I need is the price and chart... I do support bitcoin, but the day other coin overtakes bitcoin, I'm not going to be a maximalist yelling "you are all wrong" while going down in a sinking ship...
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:42:58
I don't share ur projection.. but assuming ur right, then bitcoin is likely f*cked...
Compare the biggest altruistic organization u can find and pit it against facebook company... now evaluate who's got more power and influence...
I'm a practitioner of the seven folds path of guatama budhha (I'm not a buddhist in a sense of it being a religion)... but I do accept the reality... altruistic philosophies can't beat a company with a huge marketing budget...
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:02:13

Not a narrow view, a realistic one... the moment I see signs that more people will ditch the new shiny car and use the money to feed the hungry, id be the first to shout horraaay, we are getting more enlightened as a society...

Uhmm... how do u dump on bitcoin without buying it first?... and the act of buying huge quantities (enough to make a dump spike) will always increase the price
.. and how do u know that when u dump, the market NOT will quickly rebound and absorb ur sells, especially uve been buying it and you may accidentally convinced the market its a bull rise again?
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:07:51
okay, I'm not really here to tell u how to do it... but if u ask me, from a trading standpoint... that all looooks vague... that all could happen and by the time it reaches ur, ur at the bottom trying to sell...

Oh, don't get me wrong... I think it will still peak on the next halving. My concern is more on the short-term. I'm just not too confident on this recent rally. I think therell be a major dump soon... but still bull trend on the overall..:
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:51:18
Cos u still think cryptocurrency = bitcoin, when bitcoin is just part of the cryptocurrency market... this how non-investors think as I suspect its a defense mechanism to tell themselves they are not wrong, rather than thinking of possibilities and hedge in case it happens...
The same could be said about bitcoin, to some people its bullcrap, pipedream and its worth nothing... but here u are defending it cos u value it differently...
And that's the bottom line here, perception of value... and that's the delusion of bitcoin maximalist, they think their perception is the only one that's valuable...
Sorry to break it to u, as long as other coins are still being bought and sold, then it has value, period... 
The only time ur right is only when it gets those coins goes to zero... 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:32:10
Lols, I'm a trader, and I don't fall inlove with my assets.. it blinds me to the fact of this very important investing and scientific rule:
 "I COULD BE WRONG"... 
...a philosophical standpoint that is absent with all bitcoin maximalist. Guess what other school of though doesn't allow for "I could be wrong" philosophy? 
Yep, religion...
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:12:21

U can use a bitcoin tumbler... or buy a monero, sent to anther monero wallet, convert bitcoin, send to ur new anonymous wallet...

Oh okay, I though bitcoin maximalist runs on the idea on "bitcoin is king forever, period"... and I've talked to a lot that allowed me to form that conclusion...
So tell me, what's ur "trigger" that tells u that u could be wrong about bitcoin?
As a trader, I work with specific triggers... rather that an abstract idea of "I could be wrong" as trading without a stop loss is a disaster...
So do u have a trigger for this is "I could be wrong" or are u running on "faith"?
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:51:56

one, look at historical statistics... and if u believe that history is useless for predicting future, then u can throw out almost all of predictive modeling from weather forecast to life expectancy as they use history for modeling.. 
I'm not saying the past is a crystal ball to the future either... 
Two, look at it from a risk reward ratio perspective... if ur wrong, ull lose 100% of ur money, if ur right, u could prolly get 4x ur money...
Now I ask u, if we do a coinflip, each time u lose, you lose 1 dollar, but if u win, u get 4 dollars.. how many times ud do a coinflip bet with me?
(of course, this is very simplified as u need to consider win rate.. but bitcoin succeeding right now is prolly better than coinflip)
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:04:09
buying will always make the price go higher...if u buy it otc, then there will just be a longer lag time for the markets to react...  
Start with the basics, if there are only 5 people, and there's only 5 bitcoin, u think that "spot" and otc will have different pricing?
...and don't think u get a huge dc when u buy otc... sellers know ur trying to buy to avoid spiking the price, there's a limit on the discount as sellers will also say "no man, that's too cheap"...

Meh... I think the whales are trying to signal a start of the bull run...
My logic behind that its not yet a true bull run is because the crypto market is not behind the push.. its as if money is being moved from other coins to concentrate on bitcoin and ether to give it an impression of a bull run... 
This could succeed if the "signal" attracts enough new money..  if it doesn't, I'm afraid it will exhaust and then a dump...
Remember, a bull run can never happen when there's new money coming in...

it all depends on you really... if you want to trade, the minutes, hours, dailies or weeklies, then you can be profitable if you know how to do it... trading is such a personal thing, and youll always find a profitable trader in each timeframe... I'm saying, find a timeframe that you feel comfortable, and trade on that...
To make it less confusing, there are no such thing as hodlers and traders in a philosphical sense... its just a matter of "length of the holding time"...
I understand some of you are  "hodlers" cos your not "cashing out" ever..  for these groups, yeah, they may be termed as true hodlers...
