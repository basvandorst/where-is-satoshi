It seems like its falling every week theres a new low and then a slight up and down then next week another low and just repeats again. Im scared its going to go so low that even the big whales wont buy back.

Like btcnr says.its the very few who decide and manipulate the general public regardless which country you are in.the piliticians will alwys control and be in bed with the top most biggest companys in the world who decide what war and when to fight it. 
The average joe.and i includr myself in there too can get fooled into believing what we are told by goverments and even media these daya.but with the ever more advance in social media news its becoming a much more open world as proven by the fact we are constantly questioning our giverments and the people in charge. We just need to male our own minds up and not be lead.its somtimes easier to follow then to lead yourself thats what makes us bad.we are too lazy at times to research and do our own hard work to find the truth.so try harder people and you will see alot more details with your eyes.
and another thing this isnt anything to do with bitcoin lol but i get what your sayin.peace

Its nothing to do with trust or centerlised at all but to do with price.if its cheap to send money through facebook then people will do it. And you guys should never forget the power of a brand, facebook is a global brand known by billions of people. 
I just hope that they start using cryptos oh that would be a dream come true but its a dream and they never come true anyways. Happy bitcoining people.

Very good idea.

You need some kind of protocal inside bitcoin that can slow down certain places where mining is happening at 50% so that it never reaches that critical phase. Im not a programmer but im surr its possible.as for any1 actually doing it on bitcoin i dont think people will allow it.
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:54:09
so have you had any offers yet?
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:34:57

A great idea. I know what its like to get chargeback.they are doing a charge back of £700 thats soo much money for me. And they even held the payment for two days until they checked with the customer to allow it to my paypal account and then the stupid buyer claimed off his credit card that he didnt authorise the tranaaction arrrrhhh hate chargeback its a total waste of peoples trust in paypal and ebay.the case carrys on and on and. Pray that he doesnt win please . Ok thats my rant finished.

to tell you the truth ive never had any problems with deposits and ive done a few. But the support is really bad just bad, never ever had my tickets answered lol, in a different note OKPAY don't send to BTC-e and that sucks, cant put fiat in. 
Anyone know of a good service to put money in to BTC-e, am from the UK.
Good luck with resolving your problem.

I feel for you and hope that some day you get back up again and succeed again. All the best and thank you for your time in letting us know of the dangers posed on MTgox. I have just joined them and i'am trying to create a 2 step authentication through goole authenticate app but i don't know how to do it. anyways all the best. don't pay attention to people what they say, we have all had things like this happen to us, this is how we learn through our mistakes and through others warning us.
