@_date: 2017-02-10 21:26:27
 I like the idea that someday the same number of investors who hold gold for a  store of value/collapse protection will also one day hold bitcoin.  Thats gets you to well over $100,000 a coin by most estimates using gold total marketcap divided by the number of possible bitcoins etc.
The only real brake is the rate of adoption of bitcoin into portfolios.
I have never gotten a good handle on what most affects the rate of adoption into investment porfolios. Is it law? Persuading investment advisors? Fear? Etc.
I would love to see a professional poll of a large sample of people on this.
  What determines the rate of adoption of gold into portfolios? Marketing?
Would scary ads on tv like they do for gold be the thing that convinces the masses to adopt some bitcoin as a doomsday hedge? 
Or will bitcoins dependence on the existence of a surviving  internet always be a psychological check on the amount of its doomsday hedge adoption rate?

Thats a link of links
Lets look at the links provided by that page of links.
Checking the actual link for the people in the USA using credit cards which most people use gives this   which only says sign up and does not offer a way to buy bitcoins.  This is typical of the problems people face.
The other link provided for usa buyers on that page is   also doesnt show where you can actually buy coins. It just asks for a bunch of private info to sign up. 
Established users.. please remember that most normal people dont want to have to sign up blindly to websites they dont know and give out a bunch of personal info.  They need to see upfront and clearly where the hell they can buy bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-02-24 21:13:15
Just checked libertyx. You basically end up being directed to some random little shop to do a direct purchase i guess?  Thats what it seemed.
So no online purchase with credit cards.
I already know localbitcoins is just personal encounter purchases.
Most places dont have bitcoin atms.
Folks for most people these weird things are a problem.
If newbies cant buy bitcoins online with a common credit card then this is a serious barrier to adoption.
I also just checked  bitquick.
They apparently require you to go to a bank branch and make a deposit into a private persons bank account.
Does anyone recognize just how shady and weird this all seems to the average person who just wants to buy things online using bitcoin?
If these types of things are the only thing possible then bitcoin adoption isnt realistic.
Its probably easier to buy pot on the street corner than bitcoin.

I am investigating places to buy as well for a new person who made me aware it is virtually impossible to buy coins.
I already have some from years ago but my investigation is showing me that he is right and so far all the links i have followed are outdated or dont work for people in the usa or ask you to provide a ton of detailed personal info without telling you you will actually be able to buy bitcoins first or at all.
Clearly  this appears to be a real problem.

Of course I could be wrong  but there is a strong argument that the cryptocurrency markets should at least be equal to the gold marketcap of 10 trillion. 
Currently cryptocurrencies are only worth 76 billion. Http://Www.coinmarketcap.com
I am sure home prices will rise for a while  too but it seems there is more upside in cryptos.
If you are happy i wouldnt move.
Houses are a big responsibility. Maintainence . Insurance.
One thing is sure though with both cryptocurrencies and houses. They only seem expense in price this year.  In ten years they seem like they were cheap.
I woukd be very careful about buying a home in a condo hoa. The hoa fees rise as high as rent many times and -even worse- they can prevent you from doing what you want with your home if the state laws dont protect individual homeowner rights in favor of the hoa.

I dont know what your motive to be argumentative here is.
I am just repeating historical fact.
The fdic in will only protect up to $250,000 in your deposits i beleive by law. They actually did a lot more back when some collapses happened which they didnt need to do but they subsidized and protected the rich as they always do.
But remember even the fdic cant coverall deposots everywhere at once. They assume only  a few banks will fial at any given time.
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:58:46
Eventually. (2 or 5 or 10 or 40 years from now)
(Total value of all worlds gold)/(number of bitcoins.) That gets you to somewhere around $200,000 per bitcoin depending on who you ask.
Thats just for a start as people and countries and institutions who invest in gold and hold wealth in gold realise it is an excellent store of wealth just like gold. Much better in many ways.
Many say that there are commercial functional values that increase it beyond that too. But I tend to think of ot as a simplier and better alternative to gold and the gold market players and activity has a long track record. (bitcoin now has a long track record too!)
All in all for $250 there is no other buy that you can make which has a good solid fundemental case for being so undervalued. Buy some and simply put them aside in a paper wallet so your machines cant rob you of your money somehow or through obsolescense. If im wrong you lose $250 . But im right you are substantialy richer in retirement or perhaps before.
Remember bitcoins were literally ten cents and much less for a long time. The value arguments were the same then and thousands of people have learned about them and agreed with them. The value IS getting recognized by the world and more and more big players are starting to put soke of their wealth into bitcoin.
It is now a steady multiple year trend up in value and in adoption in the big leagues.
@_date: 2015-10-16 21:53:07
Price should rise rhat will draw more deposits from other exchanges or the price stays higher.
Any bitcoin exchange that is successful in bring ing in new large institutional investors  that should invest in much larger quantities should see this happen. Its one sign of success at bringing in new higher volume buyers.
Frankly we might see a meteoric rise in price once some big institutions get invovled becuase small volume for them woukd be relatively large volume in the bitcoin world and i iust dont thonk there will be that many sellers at that volume. This will immmediately show the real market price of bitcoin in the real larger scale world of institutional investors.

It sounds like they will do transactions between themeseleves using  fast privatemethods then they will occassionally record the sum total of those off chain transaction in macro bitcoin addresses on the normal blocckchain thus offloading transaction load and keeping details private yet assuring overall master accounting on the regular bitcoin blockchain.

The wallet itself hasnt destroyed the paper wallets has it? In other if i were to lose the phone or mycellium disappeared i could rescan the original paper wallets into another program couldnt i and spend them?

I  look at global market cap of gold and divide by the number of bitcoins because i think it is very reasonable that the same people who invest in gold will eventially invest in bitcoin.
That gets you over $100,000
It could go higher but thats my reasonable longterm base logic.

Bitcoin fund sees record returns
Jersey | 29 October 2015
The Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund returned 20 percent in October, marking the best monthly performance on record since it launched in September 2014.
The fund outperformed the dollar-bitcoin benchmark price and saw lower annualised volatility, and claims to have achieved this through avoiding both the British pound and US dollar markets during weak periods. It is now fully invested.
According to the fund, the strong performance is partly down to the Jersey Financial Services Commission and the States of Jersey introducing a draft legislation to permit and promote business in bitcoin and using blockchain technology.
Global Advisors was part of a consultation group involved in developing the legislation. The draft has been in the pipeline for 18 months, and is expected to be set in to law in Q1 2016.
The fund also cited a ruling from the court of the European Union exempting bitcoin from VAT and the coming to a close of the legal proceedings involving bitcoin and the ‘darknet’ market, Silk Road, as factors leading to increased bitcoin investment.

In america you could do this in every state i beleive (property transfers are usually covered by state laws and all are consistent with the exemption of lousianna which has some old french law history.)
You could offer  a home seller 1000 bitcoins. If he agreed he would sing ove the deed to you assuming hedidnt have a mortgage. You would trnafer 1000 bitcoins onto his phone wallet or whatever. You the take the deed down to tje county courthoise and register yourslef as the new onwer by recording the deed in the registrars deed book. It has every landowner inthe county.
YOU MIGHT NEED A NOTARY REPUBLIC TO WITNESS BOTH OF YOU SIGNING AND STAMP THE DOCUMENT.
Now that you own the prooperty you can go to any mortgage lender with your deed and get a mortgage on the property. They will write you  a check for the money fromt that loan right then and there. If you got a $100,000 loan you could take that check and cash it at their bank and their bank should give you one hundred thousand cash in a suitcase if you gave them advance notice. They would also record a more than $10,000 transaction with the federal government which is the law to track drug money etc. 
Getting a loan on a property for any reason is common. You might want to buy a boat.  USUALLY you woukd deposit the check from the laon mortgage company in your own bank and then write checks for your use as you wanted. So you might write a check for the baot to the boat dealer.
But you can jist keep the cash in a mattress. Its not typical because most people have mortgages and use one to pay off the other so they never see the money.
But older people with paid down mortgages often pull oit tue cash to buy an rv to tour for example.
None of this is shady or remotely illegally as long as you properly record the true values of the transactions and pay your taxes and the bank reports the over $10,000 transactions. You also cant pull money out in smaller amounts to try to avoid reporting the $10,000 limits. Just ask dennis hastert.

Ask people who were alive the 1920's why you might not want all your money in a bank. Banks sometimes go under and temporarily or permanently freeze or seize some or all of your deposits. 
Ask the greeks. 
I am not saying it is a good idea to keep cash around. I wouldnt do it but some people do. I think it would be stupid. If your house burned down or you got robbed then you would have lost your cash. If a bank gets robbed you dont lose your money.
But some people are crazy.
By the way. One thing people dont k ow is you can trace all cash by the serial numbers on the bills. Anyone who did keep cash would be smart to take photos of all the bills serial numbers. If they got robbed tue police could trace the bills anytime they showed up.
The poloce caught butch cassidy and the sundance kid because they traced the serial numbers of the bills they had robbed from the trains. That was back in the 18800's and Even back before there were computers the police told all banks to look for those serial numbers and when they showed up they tracked down Buttch and Sundance! These days lots of businesses and all banks have money counters and al the bills seriL numbers are recorded so robbers are out of luck with cash today.

Oh god. Technical analysis tea leaves.
Letslook at fundementals.
As a more convenient gold analogy bitcoin should be at $200,000 per bitcoin when (total gold value)/(number of bitcoins) arrives. And many say Bitcoin has value far beyond mere storage of wealth fiat risk offset like gold.
So tell me why $300 or even $3000 isnt more analogous to  bitcoin being at .35 CENTS PER COIN .
Bitcoin is WAY UNDERBOUGHT.
In my humble fundemental analysis opinion.
There is a very reasonable possibilty in 5 or 10 years that we will look back on this price as we currently look back on bitcoin price at .35 cents now. 
Stop speculating and daytrading. Buy some and put your paper wallet in a drawer and bring it out again in 5 or 10 yrs when every investment advisor is telling all the late arrivals that they should have some wealth allocation in stocks, bonds, gold, and bitcoin because thats when true pricing has arrived.

Not proposing fraud at all.  In fact I went out of my way to say they need to pay all their transaction taxes etc. 
In the usa to sell property you just need to take your deed that has been signed over from the old owner to you and register it at tje country courthouse.  (usually the signing of both parties on the deed tranfer mist be witnesses by a notsry republic who stamps it. Even if not its a good idea to prevent the old owner from later denying he signed it) The old owner can have signed that deed over to you for any reason at all including trading for another peice of property, cash, a car, or just becuase they like your face.
The owner will have that deed i  their own records and if tjey dont they can go to the county court house and get another official copy.
Now if they have a mortgage then the bank may keep the deed until it is paid off depending on state law. And or the bank has recorded a lien on the property and the county registrar will not reregister the deed with the new owner unless the bank provided a paper rlease that the debt has been paid off.
When buying a property you dont have to record what form the consideration was ie a traded car, cash, another property or nothing. However you usually have record the value of the consideration and pay a transfer tax based on the value of the consideration. Thats why you can often tell what someone paid for a property form the transfer tax. You can sell a property for farless or morethan it is "worth" 
If the property is a gift becuaseof your pretty face then the transfer tax may be handled according to state or county practice.  Annual property tax however will be based on the tax assesors valuation of the property no matter what waspaid.
You can give away property. it happens all the time if people no longer want to pay the taxes and live far away for example and will never use it and it snt worth much.
If someone bought a house from an owner for bitcoin thenthey would record the actual market value of bitcoin at the time it was sold i would guess. That wouldnt be fraud. And you dont have to say "1000 bitcoins" on the tranfer deed blank. In fact many deeds dont habe a place at all for what was paid but the county registrar will wnat to know for the transfer tax to be right. For example an american could sell his house in nyew york for a suitcase full of euros if they wanted. Or for a box of junk.  But the transfer tax mist be paid on the true value. In a case where you sold it for a box of junk that might be difficult to determine and tje rile might be use a recent rough appraisal. I dont know.
By the way you can always over pay your transfer tax to hide the true price you paid for the property. That happens in commercial deals sometimes when tje new owners dont want other businesses to know whst they actually paid.  As far as I know there is no law against paying MORE transfe rtax than would be due.
I am surprosed other countries require you to pay in check.
You cant trade property in the uk for othe rproperty or a car or something?

You know its even hard to pull a lot of cash out of a bank these days right?
I think you need to start deciding what you want to buy with them like land, house, car etc. There will be plenty of individuals who will sell you large things for bitcoin.  Make sure to pay your taxes etc though. Dont  try to evade legality. Its legal to buy a house for a ferrari or anything including bitcoin. But keep it legal and pay your taxes. 
Heres an idea. Buy a house for bitcoin. Then go get a big mortage on it and get cash that way. And rent the house out to cover the mortgage payments. That way you dont even have to want to live in the house.  Make it a pure business venture.  Also pulling cash out with a mortgage is tax free because it is borrowed money (in most countries)   . Just make sure you pay the transfer tax on the property when  you buy it.
Be sure to talk with an tax accountant or better yet a tax attorney so your discussion are covered by attorney client priveledge (i guess. Right?)

My question is do you pay a gain if you trade one bunch of coin for another bunch of different coin of equal total value if you never go to cash for example as in polonoex  Is it a like kind exchange?
How long do you need to hold a coin before trading it to avoid regular income?  
How long do you need to hold it for capital gain if you do cash out? Is ot 6 months this days?
And i assume no one is talking about any sales tax.
Can trading in coin collections be a reasonable guidleine? Ie wheat pennies for lincoln nickels?   How is that taxed. Or is it morelike trading stocks?
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:50:32
There seem to be irs guidleines saying it must go into fiat to trigger a taxable event.
From another answer
There is an exception according to what you linked.
Trading coin for coin  is not gain
How are the IRS treating Bitcoins?
The IRS has recently given guidance on the specific treatment of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies, which has helped clarified the situation.
Bitcoin is a personal property, not a currency, and so is taxed as a capital asset
Gains made from converting Bitcoins into a fiat currency are subject to capital gains tax
Purchases of goods or services with Bitcoins must also account for gains
Bitcoins and other alt-coins obtained from mining is recognised income immediately at their fair value
Mining equipment can still be deducted as a legitimate business expense
End quote.
Only turning coin into fiat currancy is gain or loss.
At least that is what that summary says.
Says virtual currency is NOT treated as a foreign currency generating gains or loses on exchange.
There fore i would think that , unlike biying and trading foreign cureeencies as investments , trading virtual currenciesfor virtual currencies does NOT generate gains or losses.
Am i wrong ?

To avoid short term capital tax rates you would need to hold for a year and a day.
Crypto is treated very similarly to stocks or mutual funds. 
Are you absolutely postively sure because that is going to change my future behavior significantly.
Has the irs issued opinions on this ?
How would your gain be judged if you never go to cash?  
I someone bought a eth at 200 and when it was worth approx 300 sold it for all the maidsafecoin it would buy how do you judge the gain because you dont actually know of you could have sold all the eth at 300 because selling moves price.
And poloniex does most trades through bitcoin. The only thing one really knows is how many bitcoin you got and sokd in between (and then according to you each of thise are sub capital gain time events themselves. 
I am not challenging you. I just want to be sure.
