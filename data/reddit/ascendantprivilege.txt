Zimbabwe was the name of a ruined city and now a ruined country.

No, if EVERYONE is rich, NO ONE is rich. Rich by definition is simply having more money than most people.

Some countries are in unique positions. Equipped with nuclear weapons Australia for example would be impossible to invade, they have thousands of years worth of nuclear fuel sitting in the ground, a massive supply of natural gas for petrochemicals and transport needs, access to massive amounts of iron, nickle, coal, gold and ores of all sorts. 
A tiny population who could literally live off a continent worth of resources split up amongst a group of people you could fit in a couple of large U.S cities. If Australians realize this and slow migration enough, they've won themselves a massive chunk of the planet and an insanely out-sized chunk of the remaining, easily exploitable resources still left on the planet.
The only resource Australian lack is water and full conversion to nuclear power would make electricity cheap enough to desalinate enough water to last forever considering they have an unlimited supply of nuclear fuel and materials required to make reactors plus the space to build them away from fault-lines or fucking tsunamis.

How so?

What's racist about this? Zimbabweans have never lived better than have than they did during the time the country was called Rhodesia.

WTF is this and where can I get it?

Resource rich countries can afford a social safety net if they plan carefully. Mass migration fucking ruins that.

Why not just give it potatoes? Bad memories?

The idea that a bank can shut down your account for having the words "Bitcoin" in a transaction is the scummy part.
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:57:25
Only if you transfer funds electronically, you can transfer btc in person on paper for fiat and goods.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:48:54
Not his fault, if the bank wants to use "bitcoin" being entered into the description of a 1 dollar payment to suspend an account that is the bank's fault.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:15:50
No, YOU are missing the point. This if true is an easily exploitable attack on private bank accounts that only exists because the banks choose to do these sorts of shitty things. How would you feel if you had your bank account shut down because someone put the word "candy" or "donut" or "steak" in the description of a payment to fuck with your accounts? This is the exact same thing, only because the word is different, you're happy to let the bank take no blame in what is 99.99% their fault.

How much fuel does it use to ship gold? And it only takes energy if you want to send it electronically, you can exchange it in person on the back of a postcard if you want.

If they actually did and say a couple thousand people had accounts shut, they'd be instigating a class action lawsuit that would force banks to pay for what they've been doing to people over btc.

Yeah, sure... Give up physical possession AND control of your drives, cpu, gpu and OS. Sounds like a swell fucking idea.

Say you sold it before the moon hit to pay a gambling debt and were too embarrassed to say anything.

LOL, this will cause a minor bank run on their exchange. Fucken' idiots.
