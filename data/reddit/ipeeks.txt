$100 isn't a lot of money... Just stop going to Starbucks or Buying cigarettes.

Yes. It is hard to believe for someone on REDDIT browsing the BITCOIN sub that $100 would be a lot of money for them, redgardless of circumstances. Those 2 barriers of entry have some implied privledge to them. 
There is always wasteful spending that can be cut.

I withdrew 400k from a standard us bank and took 5 minutes or so...

I honestly dont know if that's normal or not, just offer my own personal life experience.

Literally the dumbest arguement I've ever seen on Reddit. Coinbase said that they do NOT allow employees to trade using internal information of new assets. It has been shown that there was a spike in bcash leading up to the announcement and a dump shortly after. That would insider trading as per the company's policy.

It's about short term discomfort my dude. Eat ramen every day, buy the previous edition text book or find them used.
For my household I never worry about a food budget, we get what we want and I cook many nights steak or something rather expensive. These last few weeks I've eaten pb&amp;j and cold cuts so I could invest more in BTC and LTC. 
If I can save $500 this month I can reinvest that.

I get it, but it's still an important conversation.
