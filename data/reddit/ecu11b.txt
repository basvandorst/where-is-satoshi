I just bout some last night, but on that note I would like a 20 dollar bitcoin when Mtgox gets everything straight

Is your checking interest higher then that?

I got the order info from Mtgox. Went to Walmart with Cash, filled out the money gram fourm and then by the time I got home the money was in my Account.

Is it reliable and safe? Also how fast is it?
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:24:23
It might be. It's Wal-Mart (is Wal-mart a US thing?) money wiring service.

Hypothetically you wanted to give me a bitcoin and you send it to me using the key on the physical coin. Does that void the value of the physical bitcoin?

Once I have money in my MtGox account and I am trading Bitcoin, how do I get that money back in my account once I sell the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:42:07
type in bitcoin into google news instead of coming to reddit for news. I will be willing to bet you get faster information.

Coinbase also has a transaction limit for a day. I have not seen it under that limit. If I trade on MtGox what are some other options?
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:10:31
But in that case wouldn't you just being getting alerts everything a reporter mentions the word bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-01 09:38:19
Thats called a tax
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:02:30
Could that be there game and doesn't this go against the whole idea of bitcoin
