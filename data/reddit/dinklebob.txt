I think we can get along just fine.

I'm gonna go with your interpretation of things.

Citation? Not doubting you, but put the evidence here for all to see.

What I think he's saying is that the more absolute you make government power, the more power you actually give to specific entities through the power of corruption.
A single banking entity can purchase favoritism from a government entity, and since the government is absolute, that bank benefits at the expense of everyone else.
It would be nice to see that bank instead have to deal with competition from another bank, forcing them to provide more/better services to fight for business.
Obviously there needs to be some regulation, but just making a blanket "These bureaucracies are corrupt! Institute more bureaucracy to compensate!" like fiscal liberals so often do is just stupid.

What a wonderful lesson in the hazards of market speculation and why you should always think about the motivations behind people's statements.
People like this perform a valuable service in teaching idiots about harsh reality. If only it were like EVE, when getting scammed costs you imaginary spacemoney and not bread-on-the-table money.
EDIT: To clarify, I'm not condoning what this dude did. I'm saying "valuable service" tongue-in-cheek. People got burned, but we can all learn from their mistakes and those people certainly won't be making that error again.

Oh RMT and excessive PLEXing is a thing. I just mean that if you get scammed out of 150m you've just wasted your time. 
If you get scammed out of tens of billions you're a special breed of stupid, and probably got them through in-game means instead of PLEX.

There's some pretty professional patter people can put on. If there are any holes in the story you gotta drive a fucking stake into it in a bold way but not so aggressive that you come out as an instigator. 
It's a tough balance.

Erotica 1 was a special case. The Bonus Room wasn't a "scam". It was psychological torture. 
Erotica 1 got no actual value (intel, ISK, items, etc) out of having people voluntarily get podded over and over, resetting their skillpoints. He did that (and other shit) because he's a sadistic fuck who enjoyed torturing people.
The normal scams are done for profit (and some tears, but mostly profit). These scams teach people not to trust random strangers without accountability and truly serve as a wonderful lesson for real-life.
EDIT: And even then...




send all of his ISK to Erotica 1;  
turn over any items in the redeeming system;  
turn over any PI materials;  
cancel any in-work science and industry jobs and turn over those blueprints;  
turn over all in-game clothing;  
convert any sizable balances of LP into items and contract them over as well;  
turn over all balances in any EVE-related gambling sites such as EVE Online Hold-em, SomerBLINK, et cetera.**


I'm sorry, but if you are dumb enough to do *any* of those things listed, you absolutely deserve everything that comes afterward. **These people are so goddamn lucky that they got burned this hard in a video game, because maybe, just maybe, they will now have the brainpower to avoid a scam in real-life.**

I would say buy and *spend* along with your holding. The more the currency is currency, the more valuable it is. 
Go buy a pizza.

I sound like an idiot? You sound mad.
Fiscal liberals are a thing just like social conservatives are a thing. Fiscal liberals believe in big government regulating private business and providing aid/welfare to the citizenry. I don't really know what argument you're making to the contrary.

Self posts are generally exempt from this policy because you don't get any karma. Usually they're PSA posts though. I guess you *could* call this a PSA post.

You already sold your car, we just need to collect it. We built the roads, we need to make sure there isn't an unnecessary degree of wear and tear on them. 
Where is that old fashioned sense of ~~subservience~~**duty**?
