Coinbase has an iOS app that you can buy Crypto through straight from your mobile. However I've seen lots of suggestions in this sub to transfer your Bitcoin to a wallet and not leave it with Coinbase. Breadwallet is supposedly a good wallet for iOS but I don't know enough about it to give you reasons why.

A lot of salty comments on this subreddit today. If you have the money to burn with the chance of making profit, do it. If you're risking money you need on the chance of a payout, don't do it. Simple

Can you elaborate on why this weekend will cause the price to rise? I'm new to Bitcoin and trying to learn as much as I can

Same boat as you. Think I'm limited to £325 a week at the moment. Just buying in small amounts every week or so until I make my way up to a whole Bitcoin!

I suppose it depends on how much you buy at a time. It's not out of reach to have a whole Bitcoin right now if you have the money to drop on it. I'm hoping this price rise will settle out for a bit so I can catch up! Fair enough, everybody has their own reason for buying

But he's taken the first steps, he definitely won't stop at $80...

Why?

If you don’t understand how that’s not possible then you shouldn’t be investing in Bitcoin

Only 5/6 days but I’ve read everywhere people having the same issues, I needed to cash out some bitcoin and ended up giving up at the moment and transferring it off Coinbase until I can find a different way of cashing it out. Apparently their customer service is awful, and they’ve been averaging 100K+ new accounts a day so they’re probably swamped with work too. At the moment I don’t trust them with any of my money, Crypto or fiat

Wouldn’t hold out hope, I’ve been waiting for a while now for Coinbase to verify my bank after the SEPA transfer
