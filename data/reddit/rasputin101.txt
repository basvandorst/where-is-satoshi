I'm on coinbase so I guess I just don't own BCH haha
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:17:57
I think it might drop initially after segwit. Then go up

Segregated witness (segwit) is a way for transactions to be verified without the signature being sent for each transaction. If the signature is removed the transaction takes up half the space allowing for more transactions to be processed

How can I make a private wallet/key

I think some people saw the increase in BCH and wanted to cash in. Moving some BTC over. Now that BCH is levelling I expected people will return to Bitcoin causing an increase before segwit in BTC.

Noob here,
What does this actually mean?
Are the coins I own on coinbase on "exchange"?
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:44:20
So if the transaction fees are cheaper it would make sense if people want to cash out on there profits. Causing a drop. The drop will increase demand so the price should return.
Of course this is all speculation

I dont know whether to wait until after segwit, some people think it will drop then spike
