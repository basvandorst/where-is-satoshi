I think I spoke to you in Live Support about the difference between what "other" Bitcoin service providers offer and how our service is different and can impact. You know, some people need to get out of the mindset that companies are "evil" because we want to be paid and make a profit for the service we provide. I think the market determines what fees are acceptable. Bitcoin, ALT coins, to ANY debit card is a viable and much needed service.
