Crypto is peanuts compared to the size of the stock market. Just because that guy doesn't understand crypto which is less than 0.5% than the other financial assets does not mean he doesn't know economics.
You gotta be mentally disingenuous to believe Warren Buffet does not understand economics in today's world.

It's a meme dude, just because some politicians in your country used the meme for whatever it was, doesn't mean the rest of the world can't use it anymore. It has been pepe the frog for many years in 4chan, and it still is.

How do you have a truly open subreddit? They don't ban or delete post. However, they are full of bcash supporters so anything that doesn't go with their view gets heavily downvoted. But that also happens with every other subreddit, including this one. 
I believe that's the ultimate form of censorship free. And every other subreddit should never ban or delete post. Let the users upvote or downvote what they agree or disagree with

I'm playing Devils advocate here but don't you think a lot of the price bump was people getting free bcash to convert to bitcoin?
Also, bitcoin price decline don't think it had to do with bcash. It went up too fast that wasn't sustainable, especially considering the scalability issues that were present.

Venezuelan here. This is a bit misleading. I don't mean to sound rude but all my friends are transactioning on litecoin, monero or ethereum. The fees to move bitcoin are more than a months salary, maybe is not much for people in developed countries but I don't see anyone here throwing a month or two of salary on transaction fees... Also coinbase doesn't support Venezuela. You can open am account there but not deposit money because our currency is not accepted anywhere in the world.

You can't compare socialist in Nordic countries to socialism in South America. There is a huge difference between a socialist and a communist dictator.

That's not what is happening tho. Is not like he is taxing the rich to give the poor. Government is stealing the rich, the nation, and the poor are poorer. Censorship is worse than ever and fellow Venezuelans are going to jail for simply disagreeing with the government.
I regard socialism like Norway. Sweden. Denmark to be actually working. Especially compared to Venezuela.

Bitfinex has done some "shady" things that does not explain in regards with tether. And they have threatened everyone who tries to poke holes at them with a lawsuit. 
Many subreddits tell users to be careful with Bitfinex. But then again, it is your own fault if you leave money in an online exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:07:27
I remember the first video I saw from Andrea antonopolous. He was comparing bitcoin to Western union. How bitcoin was instant and fast. And how western union charged like 20bucks just to send the money. I thought it was crazy...
Now I'm kinda disappointed that we let go of that idea. And is actually more expensive and time consuming to use bitcoin.

Calm down Felicia, it could take several days

Bitcoin can still learn from other cryptos with similar or more volume. I don't understand why some people are so aggressive towards other technologies in the space.

How about bitcoin core developers that said m it is OK for the high fees, It is ok that not everyone can afford bitcoin. It is a feature, not a problem " 
Especially since we used to compare btc to the remittance system to help the poor.

It all depends where you from. In Europe Nordic countries are socialism, and what you call socialism in South America is called communism. I live in Denmark now and have family in Norway and never did I hear the term social democracy.

To be honest, it is easy to buy and sell bitcoin than equity of a company. Maybe that's why. We can invest as little as we want and instantly from our homes

This are adults... Can't he be a supporter of bitcoin and also a friend of Roger? Why does it have to be either or...
And before I get downvoted, go out from time to time you downvoting nerds. USA has relationships with Russia and China. Hong Kong has relationships with main China. This is how the world is... Is not all about the arch-enemys you read in your comic books

I hate people throw his previous record as if it had anything to do with crypto. Makes people sound salty as fuck... I don't like or dislike Roger ver, but bring many of the good arguments against him. Not his legal background that was almost 20 years ago

They own the monopoly sadly.
But the profits tanking for Miners is pretty much a free economy. They just sell and people keep buying. They are not the ones to blame, Miners are.

He served time in federal prison for that. It is public information. The man has nothing to hide and I don't understand why people keep using that against him. Makes them look childish and salty as fuck...
There are many things one could bring up against BCH instead of attacking the guy personally for his past

How about scam-artist, criminal and even terrorist association?  you're quite an extremist,  perhaps even a "bitcoin maximalist". 
Then again, this is reddit so only a handful of people will take you seriously without knowing where you coming from. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:11:43
Not at all, I invest just a small amount I don't care to lose in some smallcap cryptos because I have an interest in understanding the overall space more and more.
I actually got introduced to crypto by watching some old videos from Roger ver about 2 years ago. He was what you call a shill for bitcoin and everyone here loved him until he didn't support bitcoin anymore. Just like Richard heart, once he announced he wasn't a bitcoin maximalist anymore and everyone in here turned against him.
The point is that we have to be acceptable that people will have different opinions and learn how to argue with valid points and aeguments instead of blindly accusing someone about their personal stuff that has nothing related to crypto 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:03:03
You making it sound as if he sold c4s or something lol.
I don't know how old are you but back then it was normal to sell guns and ammo on eBay. He was selling firecrackers (explosives) that are used for pest control. He wasn't the only one, but he was one of the few that didn't have a license for it. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:47:06
They keep selling asic and people keep buying them. Then they complain it doesn't make any profits. Do those people even understand economics? And they blame  Bitmain for selling too many... 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:58:19
Who se would they sell to? Anyone else that wanted to compete with Bitmain could've bought from the Taiwan manufacturer just like everybody else does. This does not change anything unfortunately, maybe we will have more supply but I doubt it will do anything in regards with competition
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:42:09
Samsung is producing asic chips. Not actual Miners. In other words, Bitmain will be Samsung client, not his competitor. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:37:06
Weird thing from an outsider is that you guys idolize Ross Ulrich for bringing attention to bitcoin even though he is in jail for life for being a drug kinping and soliciting hit and on fbi....  
On the other hand you guys hate Roger ver who had also brought attention to bitcoin in the past and even got named bitcoin Jesús by this same community and call him a criminal for selling "M80 firecrackers".. Here is a video of what specifically Roger was selling:  
I don't know Roger ver, but I hate people calling him a criminal for selling M80s in the early 2000s... I know people who sell the same fireworks, and if you're from outside the USA You buy these things at any firework shop. And you see teens using them on new years and other holidays...

This cheap stalin looking motherfucker scammed the bond market out of $150BILLION dollars 5 months ago... That's why no other country will ever do anything for Venezuela in advanced. They are insolvent and on financial default since November 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:39:37
I don't think you understand what Samsung is doing... They are producing the chips for asic mining not Miners themselves. That means Bitmain will buy those Samsung chips. How is Samsung eating their lunch? If anything it will help Bitmain increase their production 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:16:21
Terrorist?  just look at the lingo you use in your sentences. I'm just trying to understand both sides. I don't own btc nor bch anymore. 
Look at his court doc online, it's open to the public. If you actually read it, it specifies pest control crackers. And people go to jail all the time for a lot less. Don't be disingenuous believing otherwise. 
I'm not saying Roger ver is a good person. I'm just saying we shouldnt attack someone by calling him names related to his past. It just makes ones argument weak. There are plenty far more intellectual arguments against BCH.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:23:58
The difference is that bonds are securities backed by the state... So when Venezuela stop paying those bonds they fucked themselves, became insolvent and no one lends them money anymore.
You think petroscamcoin will be better? There is no obligation with this crypto for them to recognize your petro after you bought it. How you gonna cash it back?
