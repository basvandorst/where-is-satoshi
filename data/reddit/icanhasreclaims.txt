I think you're response is a bit misguided.  Just my opinion though, but I would say the coverage of Ross's sentence has paved the way for more adopters than GBTC going live or NASDAQ using Bitcoin blockchain.  If you think soccer moms will begin adopting Bitcoin once the drugs go away, I'd evaluate that at close to 0% adoption.  
So, blame it on what you want, but people are not adopting Bitcoin because it all goes way over their head.  Most people out there still have the minimum letters necessary for their email passwords.  That ain't gonna fly with Bitcoin.

Just another suggestion if you have Coinbase instant, there are bull indicators all over the chart right now, we are only about $2.50 away from a huge breakout.  A $5000 buy on the exchange should give you about 4-5% daily return for the next week or so.

First and foremost build a trustworthy trading reputation with as many buyers and sellers as possible.  Then find a price point that is worth it for you to list an ad for someone to buy bitcoin using an amazon gift card purchased from from a retail store.  
When you've settled on your price point, wait for a buyer.  Once someone initiates an offer, ask them for a photo of a receipt from that day or recently with a hand-written message that says, "I sold (LBC trader) a $x amazon gift card for x BTC."  Then, have them send a photo of the card front and back.  
I typically do not allow email delivery of gift cards unless I know the trader and have trusted them in the past, and I charge a much higher premium.  If you do trade for email delivery cards, use them immediately.  Chargebacks are much easier on the codes delivered by email.
It is really important on LBC to search through the feedback of traders initiating trades.  Don't just look at the first page of feedback.  Dig through it.  If they give one hint of shadiness, it isn't worth doing business with them.  Although, I should mention, a lot of LBC users get butthurt and leave negative feedback for the wrong issues.  So, do your research.  Also, check the forums.

I'm just intrigued because I had read earlier yesterday that Circle "circumvents" Coinbase's 1% fee by keeping the exchange price lower than Coinbase's.   Then, I checked again when you said you exchanged on Circle, and sure enough, it was $3 higher than most of the other exchanges.  At the relatively low price movements we've made the past few months, it would almost seem profitable to trade Circle's arbitrage.

@_date: 2015-06-30 17:07:26
If someone wants to go through all of that effort then, perhaps, but I rarely trade with traders who have less than 30+ feedback, and the only instance I have dealt with on the level you're describing was through a Reloadit card number that a carder broker sold to me.  I raised a lot of hell and got my coin back.  But, yes, there are many traders(which I point out in another comment) on LBC which should not be trusted.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:46:41
You're not going to get a better deal on bitcoin that way.  The way I understand purse.io works is the inverse of that.  The people buying bitcoin with amazon payments are paying the premium.  
If you wanted bitcoin quickly at something around the Bitstamp market value, you're best bet is going to be starting a Coinbase or Circle account.  Also, depending where you are, you could possibly benefit from a local trader on LocalBitcoins.com, but the value that you want to buy is going to be cheaper on Coinbase, Circle, or an exchange.  If you have a credit card and once the exchange completes your KYC/AML check, you can transfer fiat instantly from your bank account.
But, I don't think you'll be able to purchase BTC with amazon payments at a premium anywhere.

Honestly, the risk is low as long as you're smart about it.  Only deal with traders who have a good/solid reputation.

So, I purchased a $12 item on ebay.  When I used the paypal checkout, I made sure prior to checkout that my default payment was the payment I intend to use.  This particular default payment is a small, lesser-known bank in the Pacific NW.  I have other forms of payment listed on my paypal account, however, they are not set as default.  When I check out, I ensure that the payment method being debited is my small lesser-known account because it has the most money in it.  Then, I conclude the checkout and go on about my day.  2 days later, I get a message from boa saying my account has been over-drawn.  I think to myself, I haven't used that account in ages, that's odd.  So, I check my online banking.  Low and behold, paypal has skipped my default account, went straight to the boa account and debited it.  After months of attempts at contact, I finally get paypal and boa on the phone at the same time.  That was actually sort of fun.  I have it taped somewhere.  But, in the end, I was told by boa, "basically the bank is your garage and paypal has keys to your garage.  As long as paypal has keys to your garage they can take your cars out whenever they want to."  (something along those lines...)  
I still feel like I was robbed, but I understand their explanation.  And, that was the last day I used paypal.
tl;dr:  Paypal can drive your car if you give them keys to your garage.

Okay, for serious, how many ice cream sandwiches were included with the trade?

I agree.  I love their service, but they still have a lot of issues to work out.  Specifically carders.

Which, for its intended purpose, LBC is great for local trading, but there's money to be made in the online trading where you never know what you're going to get.  
Even with traders you've trusted before, the scams that occur in online trading are atrocious, so sellers are going to take a major risk now that most of the local, in-person traders in NY will move to trading for online assets.

Just wanted to say I appreciate you doing this and it has been a great read, but I hope this doesn't come back and bite you in the ass.  
Also, got any Carl Force stories?  Is there any substance that he was involved with crashing MTGox?
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:13:07
It looks like my orders are still in, so hopefully they will stay in place while they work it out.
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:04:05
Yep and all the monies went to Carl's CampBX account with no record of CG's or anyone else's death.  
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:23:14
You are correct.  If they did not take full custody of the coins, [things like this would not happen.](
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:24:00
Unfortunately, money laundering does not get you that far.  He'll do max 5 years and be paroled.  He's already paid about a third of his restitution and fines with his stolen coin.  The world is not a safe place with people like Carl Force.  It's malpractice against the constituents of the US.
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:52:34
Yeah, they did this during the summer sale and haven't reconsidered.  I have purchased many games from them using bitcoin, and it bothers me that they cite fraud as an excuse.  
Bitcoin is one of the only payments that humble accepts that 1. can't be refunded, and 2. can't be charged back.  So, I dunno what the deal is here.  I'm not going to use their key service anymore until they fix it.  Which, it's too bad because they are currently having a DRM-free sale, and I try to support those titles first.
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:04:04
Just a guess, but it may have to do with exchange fees.  I recently made a gift purchase for a friend on amazon.uk and my bank charged an exchange fee for converting dollars to pounds.

I've always told myself that if I could afford a car like the f430 or sl65 price range, I'd still get the Elise.  Every time I see someone driving an Elise, I'm envious.

Special Agent Carl Mark Force who was the DEA's inside man for the Silk Road mentioned a few months before MTGox crashed that he was capable of doing the crashing.

I agree with your sentiments.  Coinbase and Circle have allowed bitcoin to become similar to Paypal in order to pay for items, and the easier this becomes, the more useful and adopted bitcoin will become.  
Currently, there are too many steps involved with paying for items in bitcoin.  First you have to get bitcoin, then you have to exchange it for fiat or gift cards or make a wishlist where people buy something for you and you give them bitcoin.  It's all so convoluted that the transactions are not easily processed.  
The day that we can log onto our Amazon account and choose "Pay with Coinbase wallet", will be the day that bitcoin functions properly as a currency.  Until then, we've still got a lot of work to do and processes to simplify.

He also claims to have crashed Mt. Gox.  Tried to shutdown Venmo.  Covered a lot of his trail using PGP on the DEA's dime. And threatened to kill Ross using his "Death From Above" alias(p. 25 line 1 of criminal complaint).
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:32:50
Strongly disagree with this.  Gwallet will shut down your account for associating bitcoin.  If yours has not been shut down, then it just hasn't happened *yet*.

It's so weird. If someone had made the same comment you did 4 years ago, you would get down voted to goblin town and have 30 responses calling him a killer and saying he specialized in murder for hire. Really crazy how quickly perception can change.

If they can squeeze in a few spots where items are paid for with BTC, it could actually get a lot of people's attention.  
At this point, I can't tell if Mike is poking fun at BTC or if he is trying to help people understand it.
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:32:59
You're sort of correct.  While Ross's trial dealt with the charges from Tarbell, most of the information that the judge and prosecution relied on came from the investigations undertaken by Carl Force and Shaun Bridges.
@_date: 2015-09-01 05:22:50
Yer thinking bout Carl.  Either way, it won't make sense to you as we all know nothing makes sense to you.

So, the basic rule is don't buy more than you can afford.  
Since you've already bought, you can either hold or find a target where you're willing to sell.  The target can be higher or lower than your entry point, but that's up to you.

Ross was not ever proven guilty of what you're saying.  You are lying. Have you always been a liar, or do you selectively choose evidence?
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:53:15
It's regression.  Striped credit cards are a super antiquated way to transmit money.  Bitcoin fixed that, but now everyone wants to regress.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:52:39
Thanks. I must have missed this information when it was first available.

If we could only really know what went down. Mind is blown already. Only going to get more winded. Every jtrig agent under the sun loves when they see posts about Ross because they know it means overtime for spreading misinformation.
I followed Ross's trial closely alongside the charges and conviction of carl force, and im familiar with vj's involvement. but all of the info you've provided is news to me and I like to feel I'm clued in. I guess I should start checking r/dnm here and there again. Thanks again for making me aware. Time to start digging. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:38:23
You're an idiot. Stop spewing lies. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 14:23:04
That's a stupid way to interpret it and straw man at best.  The regressive aspect is bitcoin has this incredibly secure, useful way for us to all become our own bank, and bitcoin is making future use cases for the credit card companies these services are emulating.  Using striped cards is like still using aol when there's chrome for browsing the internet.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:56:29
Yeah, that whole "proven guilty" part doesn't mean fuck all. You're still an idiot.

Sure, I'm okay with that, but these cards are at the end of their lifespan.  Paying from a smart device will be the standard method of payment sooner than most think.

You're still missing the point.  The striped card pos system that Trader Joe's uses is antiquated.  It comes from the early 1980's.  It's a dumb machine, yet you want to switch your smart machine back to the dumb machine.

As others have mentioned, a state where a drug war doesn't exist makes Ross's website just another website.

The state suppressed every single bit of the defense's evidence. Carl Force should sit on the witness stand.
