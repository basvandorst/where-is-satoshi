100% agree. In fact, I don`t see nothing wrong using multiple currencies. And as for me I`m choosing strong and dedicated community betting the coin will survive. +100 doge

Article sounds like Ray Kurzweil "Singularity is near". From historical prospection trends of price and adoption are exponential, but from average Joes point of view it looks linear. Can you imagine just two years ago it would go that high? A year ago it was hard to buy anything but a bottle of beer in a kind of "community" pub. Today you can travel to space with it. Now try to imagine yourself in just one year and put your vision on paper.... Im pretty sure you`ll laught at it when time would come.
