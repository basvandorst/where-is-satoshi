Yeah if they use their own proprietary coins then it'll just be reward points. Not too exciting. Though if they have a big enough ecosystem with entertainment, social, etc. it could be useful. But do they have that right now? Not so sure.
The idea from Tron seems to be useful for something like Facebook, but Tron is Chinese. A Tron-Tencent combo would be killer.

I hope I live to see the day that Vanguard puts out a low cost crypto index fund. It'll even have income/"cash flows" from "dividend paying" cryptos like NEO or PoS coins lol.. Don't think us crypto folks aren't one step ahead already ;)
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:55:21
My thought is we are in price discovery and that crypto will stabilize in volatility once it reaches the market cap of the other asset classes, and at that point we will have proper valuation metrics for crypto.. Could be wrong though.
Googled it, doesn't seem like Vanguard has any currency funds. Though the use currency hedging in some of their international funds.. They do have a commodities fund VAW. That's pretty close to crypto, which are like "digital commodities"..

Bitcoin is deflationary (only 21 million coins will ever be minted) and thus gets more valuable over time as a currency. It retains wealth, similar to gold. Fiat is what generates no wealth if kept under a mattress due to today's central bank policy of Quantitative Easing.
The financial crisis was caused by "overspending" in the sense that people and banks took out loans to get better returns on investments and houses that they can't afford. They overleveraged their capital and eventually found out they could not realize the borrowed money. So instead, they started printing money or began a policy of Quantitative Easing instead of reckoning with the fact that they overspent in order to defer the inevitable--margin call.

Each sell is a taxable event. If I realize a profit from 5k to 17k, unfortunately, I'm owing IRS money for that 12k gain. If I decide to buy back in, sure, but that's a new buy. Its weird and annoying cause its reinvestment but I guess that incentivizes hodling and less trading.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:34:41
Right, but more and more people are deciding not to go back to fiat with this money. They will Hodl until it reaches its full potential with micropayments, smart contracts, loans and personal finance, etc. If and when that happens, Bitcoin will be worth a lot more than now, but I still won't sell it. I will instead use it.

When was the last time there was a run up like this? Was it just like this? Was it last year? Only jumped on the train this year.

Short term capital gains can be a dosey. Unless I think I can make more than 30-ish percent on the drop with impeccable timing, I'm hodling. Also trading fees. And stress.

Hey thanks for the response. What were the signs that you were hearing about tech stocks? I was just hearing that tech stocks were great and on fire, especially stocks as NVDA and other semiconductors. And I was extra bullish on it because of crypto (though now I realize that NVDA does not make ASICs that are used for Bitcoin now, but GPUs are still for Ether). Then all of a sudden there was a fire sale. I somehow missed that memo..

I am somewhat worried right now. What happens if Tethers are not backed by USD and the bubble pops causing a bank run on the exchanges? Is this a scenario where many exchanges will close? If so, that is very scary.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:27:03
I didn't give out advice saying buy only Bitcoin. I'm just saying I am more afraid to invest in the stock market right now than crypto. Stocks seem overbought and are due for a correction. And a correction in stocks may take a decade to recover. Also, I am not sure if it is being propped up artificially through easy monetary policy. Also, US economy is highly leveraged through debt these days. These are just my opinions, to each their own.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:27:14
I just hope they don't turn off the power to bitcoin. All our money will be wiped!

I've read that Bitcoin is a property thus not subject to wash sale rule as stocks or securities are.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:36:37
Good point, but since I bought in basically at order of magnitude smaller from earlier this year, this does comes into play.
For example, say I bought in at 5k. And I decided to day trade to sell at 17k. Tax: (17k-5k)*0.3 = ~ 4k owed. If I bought back in at 13k, I'd be even ish.

Look around us. Tuition rates skyrocketed. Housing prices skyrocketed. Medical treatment skyrocketed. Even fine art skyrocketed. The only thing that didn't was regular consumer goods, because then all the little people would notice. Meanwhile, your wages haven't really changed. Ask yourself why did all this happen? After thinking about it for a day or two, then you will realize what this Bitcoin vs. USD thing is all about.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:13:33
I think the jury is still out on whether or not it saved the economy. The US government debt hasn't been paid off, and the inflation from QE caused things like medical bills, education, housing to skyrocket, and citizens have to borrow a ton of hyper-inflated money to finance these as wages stagnated. I think this may eventually cause another crash akin to the 2009 mortgage crisis, and the hyper-inflation cycle will repeat. This is why Gold, Real Estate, or Bitcoin or any non-inflationary asset can start to look attractive right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:00:02


We are in a decline. Look at housing prices, tuition prices, and healthcare prices. Look at Gold prices or even fine art painting prices over the last few years. Meanwhile wages are the same and stagnant. Only consumer goods haven't gone up that much. Only reason I can think of is because if consumer goods went up, all the little people would notice and start a massive riot. I think the USD is screwed.

There will be digital financing products associated with Bitcoin in the future that operate with 10000x more efficiency. SALT lending is one example. GPUs and ASICs are the new "banks." Banks are done. USD is done. Get out before the rush.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:22:34
Its a known fact that stock markets eat small investors alive. I'm more afraid to invest in the stock market than crypto right now to be honest. The banksters always have something up their sleeve that will screw us all.

Who created the excess reserves? The US government. Whenever they wanted to. The graph on the right seems to show that they only had significant excess reserves after the 2008 crash not before it. I think this is due to their QE policy where they created reserves to buy back US treasury notes. Is QE fancy term for printing? Sounds like it to me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:12:29
About 1 month ago, this exact same thing happened with Bitcoin falling 7k to 5k with a BCash pump. Did we not learn that this is actually a time to BUY THE DIP? If it were this predictable every month for the next year, we should not be upset at all, we should be getting rich every single month.

Also, you never know when the money managers decide to pull out of the stock market. It is they who decide. When I was investing in tech recently, they pulled out and bought financials due to the tax cuts. However, they will never tell you when they do that, and it will all be insider info and a "surprise" to all of us. For all we know, they might be planning an exit on the S&amp;P next week.

Don't forget they said the same regarding mortgage backed loans.

If one day, people's paychecks are in say digital money, like ethereum, then I can see how you can borrow against your future salary in automated smart contracts, and loans will be garnished from wages automatically. Also Bloom is a coin that gets credit ratings on the blockchain.

I know you are talking about stocks, but just FYI, I've read an article that the wash sale does not apply to crypto because they are property not stocks or securities.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:58:22
OK, but the government is only able to generate the loans because they own the treasury. And they are generating "cash" which is really just devaluing the original money. Worse, its not cash, its credit because the government is in debt.
Hmm, now that I think about it, sounds kind of like Tether..
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:48:50
Remember that Bitcoin is now becoming a store of value to replace fiat. People are parking money in it now, millions and billions. That is only why the price is up and will continue to reach gold level market caps and beyond. If you are excited about the rise of Bitcoin, then you should not worry about payments for now.

There wasn't much inflation prior to 2009 crash. They just gambled on risky derivatives. Though I could argue that if treasury yields were good enough, there would not be such crazy markets with people seeking higher yields with mortgage-backed junk bonds or derivatives of those. It was AFTER the crash when they used inflation to artificially prop up the global economy.

The problem is that central banks have devalued fiat to the point where we feel the need to spend and not invest in ourselves and retain our wealth. Spending money on necessities makes sense. Overspending is what led to the financial crisis and the massive debt in the treasury. This will be repaid by our grandkids when the central banks and their Ponzi scheme finally collapses, and unfortunately they will be struggling for food.

And yes, it all started when the banks broke the economy. Look at the US debt, the US dollar value after QE, and gold prices after the 2009 crash and tell me you're not scared it's in a bubble. Then look at Bitcoin. Then know you are really just protecting yourself.

Just learning about GPUs recently and got excited about NVDA, as well as all the companies that buy GPUs for datacenters. Only curveball might be AI ASICs though! Though of course NVDA will have a competitive advantage. Definitely bought the dip!

Futures shall correlate heavily with the price of Bitcoin and will actually influence it. If there is a high demand for futures, then that will drive the futures price up. And if the futures price is up, then buyers of Bitcoin will be incentivized to buy bitcoin to close the price arbitrage.

Many more people hold BTC than BCH. What about people who bought BTC the last few months after the fork and during BTC's huge run?

From an economics standpoint, Bitcoin is deflationary and why I wouldn't spend it, maybe ever! It will only grow more valuable as there is less and less. Spend your fiat instead. Or another crypto that has less value.

I'd be happy if Bitcoin becomes the new gold. Gold market cap is 5 trillion dollars. If crypto is to succeed, SOMEONE has to become the new gold or crypto will just be play money never to challenge the status quo fiat system.

If miners coordinate the destruction of BTC and somehow succeed, then you'll have millions of people who lost their investment in BTC. People will not touch crypto after something like that, and you will lose significant market cap to crypto overall. Everyone loses except a few people.

Its because Bitcoin is the most famous. It is also the original cryptocurrency and branded as such.
In line with the gold analogy, one question to think about is why do we think think humans settled with gold as the special metal worth value? You could argue that it was just random and that we could have easily just settled on another "better" rare metal.

Tech boom in recent years is due to easy money venture capital spending. We won't have those anymore. In the system we have now, you have to work/risk enough to offset the inflation. In deflation, we don't, so people do less work and invest less as it would be worse than just parking your money as is. So economy would stall and there would be less opportunity overall.

I can totally see future blockchain securities that pay out dividends to stakeholders as a fraction of the individual transactions themselves. Quarterly revenue accounting numbers can be edited or tailored to look a certain way. So blockchain can solve that problem too. I think stocks will be blockchains basically. The possibilities with blockchain!
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:23:51
One day crypto and blockchain will be able to give real time returns on transactions on the network. That's kind of the idea behind proof of stake. Its not so hard to imagine a blockchain ownership stake system in the future where you own stakes in "companies" that provide specific digital service. And your stake gives you the automated right as a "smart contract" to every individual transaction as opposed to the manually reported revenue per quarter as a dividend.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:12:15
If flows between BTC and altcoin remain the same, it will adjust to whatever BTC price it is. Example, if BTC is at 5k, then all of a sudden 10k, but alt coin buying remains the same in and out, then ppl are buying altcoin for "twice the cost" (but same relative to BTC) and thus it moves up double as well.

Yeah but once its saturated and reached its "fundamental value," whatever the market determines that to be, and in equilibrium it'll pretty much move like the regular market today, especially commodity markets i.e. gold. Remember a gallon of gas was "stable" at $4 for years until it wasn't, now its "stable" at ~$2 due to fundamental game-changers (fracking in this case). This is not considered volatile. However, if there is some kind of global liquidity crunch it could crash fast just like the stock market a few weeks ago.
We are nowhere near stable yet. Right now, the fact that people are willing to buy 400 million dollars worth of this at a time moving 50% in a week tells me that this is in price discovery mode and could be worth much much much higher (or not pan out at all).
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:47:08

Banks made risky products that preyed on people trying to rise up. When shit hit the fan they got free govt bailout money to keep them afloat and protect their own wealth. As a result, the bank stocks/power brokers are now thriving and the US debt is ballooning while former savers' wealth are slowly and painfully disappearing due to currency devaluation. Banks siphoned and funneled all the money to themselves but because of bailouts took no risk at all. Meanwhile, regular people have to keep working for scraps to stay afloat cause their currency is now worth less. This wouldn't have happened with a decentralized currency that doesn't purposely funnel/manipulate value/money away without permission.
