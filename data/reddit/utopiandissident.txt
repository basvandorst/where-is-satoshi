That is honestly what my mother thinks it's only for too!

I know. I was going to buy with my own. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:47:06
I need a wallet that's good
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:14:59
I have iOS and parental restrictions ;-;

I asked them if I could've invested in just a fragment of a bitcoin, if it tanked then oh bad my fault. If it didn't, my gain. 
Tl;dr wanted to invest like 100$
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:57:05
Ooooo I'd be salty over that, at least you get to buy BTC!:)
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:46:32
I need to find a good wallet, and I can make the cash. Already have it.

A restaurant after my own heart

Thank you, I'll make sure to remember that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:26:09
Oh extra question, can I buy a BC through my bank? Orrrr..?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:22:22
Ohh my lorrdddd. Know any good places/anywhere I can buy? Or is it online? If the price rises even more within the next few days I'll buy a fraction of a coin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:16:44
No no, I just felt it'd be better to buy a coin while. Though you make a good point. Start small and see if the fraction I'd buy gets better value? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:18:28
Yiiiikes, I'm just interested in it because it's seeming to become a more influential currency since I've heard of it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:15:20
Oh yes, I'm well aware I can buy smaller parts of a coin. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:07:55
Awesome thank you!
