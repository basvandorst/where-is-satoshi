I didn't have such a good experience with Advcash. They demanded my ID although the card limit wasn't achieved. And their support is not helpful.

Cool, I've been to Vietnam in November but haven't seen any places with the bitcoin sign:(
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:52:37
Their support is a legend: everyone talks about it but no one heard from it ever
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:42:31
Alts are down while BTC is on the rise and maybe some panic sell. Should buy some for myself.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:32:31
That was a surprise for me also but it'll grow more for some time and then drop.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:46:04
Oh, c'mon, dude, you're everywhere! enough with the same comments already. I use my "own damn BTC wallet" but I need an online one also and every time I go to read and check a new thread - here you are shitting. 
I have my own reasons to use those wallets and not just for peer-to-peer transactions. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:35:22
I prefer Blockchain or Xapo, but not Coinbase - too many problems with them lately.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:45:01
I wish I had a hard fork..(
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:38:37
I'd say neither. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:49:02
Congrats, you created another bitcoin user!
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:24:49
I choose not to believe these stories anymore. It hurts too much
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:40:26
never, because I was a retard((
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:27:01
Ah, a story with a happy end. So rare these days.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:05:52
That's brutal, man
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:34:11
Eh, it's just more money...boring
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:51:24
But they apologized! what else do you want?!
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:38:39
Go, Japan!
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:04:02
I use Electrum and some online wallets like Xapo, Coinbase but recently they've started to disappoint me. There sre new upcoming mobile and online wallets like Paycent and Bonpay, maybe they will be better.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:54:12
I'm almost sure there is no live person there. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:54:11
Now i try not to do small transactions because of these stupid fees
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:54:54
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:16:25
Why is this happening? I can't find the reason in the news.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:22:07
Just keep hodling, don't listen to anyone, trust yourself
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:26:46
You know nothing!
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:04:19
I'm not surprised...
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:25:17
Yes, you're right. The bigger amount, you want to exchange, the better rate. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:23:10
Buy land and a house and a car and soon you'll have a girlfriend.  
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:11:02
I try not to diverse too much. I feel uncomfortable otherwise. Electrum has the biggest part. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:21:54
So, bye, bye my bitcoins, I'm coming
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:22:53
Story of my life
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:46:37
Coinbase, but there is a lot of negative feedback 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:37:28
My condolences and thank you. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:39:11
He has no belt though...
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:43:53
Coinbase removed my GA once but only after I asked them to. They changed it to SMS and after that I had a difficulty to change it back.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:29:22
In the year 2000 I had no wealth to evaluate
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:43:48
The fees will be too big
