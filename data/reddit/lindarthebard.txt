Can you (or anyone else) make a recommendation?

I voted.

FWIW I donated 50mBTC.

I thought this the first time I read the security tips for starting a bitcoin wallet. I thought to myself, "Don't people already do this with paper money?".
Personally I feel fine carrying around 500mBTC, but I get paranoid when I'm carrying 10$.

Really cool. I'm linking my mother to this.

I've spoken with one of their representatives, who has heard of Bitcoin and is a fellow redditor, and said that a lot of people have been requesting it. If you care to, please submit a comment card asking for Bitcoin support. I know Foodler already accepts Bitcoin, but they have a terrible selection, whereas GrubHub has *amazing* help staff and a great selection. Any time I've had trouble with them, they've immediately resolved it, even going so far as to comp whole 20+$ meals because the restaurant botched the order or took two hours to deliver.
Even if they don't end up accepting Bitcoin, I recommend checking them out.

Yeah, the free gift is capped at 30 instances and I have to be online playing every 15 minutes, wherein I get 0.00005BTC each instance. So, I could do that, or I coooouuuuld just run my pooled miner, not have to play to earn twelve pence an hour, and then do something more constructive with my time. Seems like spam link to me.

I sent an email. =D

This doesn't contribute to the conversation.

Perhaps I didn't understand what Coinbase does... &gt;_&gt;
What about any other services for USD -&gt; BTC ?

It's really sad that people will fight a losing battle to maintain the status quo instead of embracing new ideas. Petrol companies have spent countless dollars stunting the growth of the electric car industry instead of buying it out and transitioning their market to electric car production and fuelling stations. Why spend X to stop something from dying when you can spend X/10 to let something die and smoothly transition business to another venue? It's really just fear of the unknown, the great American pastime!

I know is a Coinbase employee. Maybe ask him? He's been really cool with responding to stuff.
@_date: 2013-07-16 06:25:14
Fred, I just started using Coinbase because of how easy it is to buy BTC. I actually recommend your service whenever I talk to businesses about Bitcoin. I'm trying to get Walgreens to get in on this too.

Yes, but most Americans are stupid, uninformed, and get their news from CNN / Fox.

"BITCOIN USED TO FUND ILLEGAL ARMS PROJECT"
That's *exactly* the headline we need, rite guiz?

Interesting conversation.
However, what if I have 0 power cost at 4Ghash/s?
If I'm not paying for power, does it *really* matter?

The person who wrote this article really doesn't seem to understand what BTC is/does. The *entire point* of the currency is so that we have a digital payment system that *isn't* regulated by an outside body. The author is saying Bitcoin won't survive without that, but the truth is that Bitcoin won't survive *with that*. I'd jump ship the moment that happened, and I think the people against BTC are counting on that. We'll have to fight tooth-and-nail to prevent that from happening, because BTC won't survive *for sure* under control of an outside institution.
