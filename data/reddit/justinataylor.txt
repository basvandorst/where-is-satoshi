Reselling electronics can net some great profits. 
Right now it is nearly impossible for me to find a PS4, unless I buy it from a person who can mark the price up. They could have bought it for $400 at the store, but since the store does not have any in stock they could sell it to me for $500. Some people are willing to pay upwards of $1000 or more just to avoid the wait time.

Thats the way I try to explain Bitcoin's to people who ask what gives it value. What green dollar bills value? Or gold. We as a society decide what we will accept as currency. Hell if a large enough population decided tomorrow that they will only accept Sugar as currecy then sugar would be the new thing. 
In ancient Africe, salt was used as currency. Hell it was worth more than gold at the time.

I got a frantic call from my boss this morning. He appearently read a article on yahoo that said the bitcoin founder has gone missing and that the compangy was going under. So hes telling me all this so I would know bitcoin is dead and should sell what I have while I can.

There are some companies looking into it now, with the specific goals of prospecting certain asteroids for mining in the new couple of years, then taking the ones they want back to Earth's orbit and mining it in LEO. 
One asteroid could contain more rare earth metals than what we have mined so far.

It's slowly getting there, my aunt who has no idea about anything technology wise had questions about Bitcoins over Thanksgiving dinner. My mother and I were talking about it and my aunt said she keeps hearing about them all over but has no idea what they actually are. I explained everything, but that didnt help cause my uncle came in and basically called it a scam because it's on the internet and just like that damm commercial with the french model "Do you believe everything you read on the internet?".

This guy should never write about Bitcoin again, read his other articles on the subject. He refer's to Bitcoin's as being a Ponzi scheme a few times. Stated that it recieved a knockout blow back when China "banned it". 
He make's it out as only criminals use it to buy drugs, and other illegal activities. That any "innocent" person that has invested in bitcoin has essesiantly wasted their money and will more than likely never see it again. 
Also made a bold face lie saying that it lost 50% of its value yesterday during the "crisis", dropping down to $350. As of right now Bitstamp/Coinbase both show a price of around $650. 
The only thing it seems he got right in this article was, "In the fall of 2011, bitcoin was at $2. By November 2013 it had risen to more than $1,000! If that’s a currency, those bitcoinians must be some productive citizens."

It will recieve maybe a weeks worth of new's before something else pops up. Then the media will drop it.
Some will bring it p every now and then when something else happens with bitcoins. Like you said "Hot dog vendor is now excepting Bitcoins, hopfully he avoid's exchanges like Gox, and won't lose everything like thousands of other who bought in".

Was this sarcasm? If so you should add /s at the end. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:14:36
Depends on how we look at it. 
I bought 2 at 700, and it went up to 900. So that was a potential 400 profit. But now its down to around 550, so I am down 300 from investment. Or I am down 700 from the high it hit.

"We will also be allowing for custom servers to be created where all players who join the server have to pay a buy-in in Dogecoins, and the player who survives gets to keep the coins at the end of the game."
Could this be considered gambling or a contest of sort? 
If I am understanding it correctly, say 10 people pay to get in, the 10 people fight and who every wins gets all the doge coins. They then transfer that into USD or whatever currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:01:19
Does this mean we can expect a price jump sometime soon? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:11:07
Well, in theory if Bitcoins were to ever become that big. So much it is considered reserve currency for the world, worth $100,000, is the main currency used for online transactions. 
Then it would be safe to assume that governments around the world would rethink their positions on Bitcoins, including the IRS.

Probably go through the same precaution companies have to take against credit card thieves. 
Thieve will get their hands on CC scanners like those at a Gas station, and will place them over the already installed one. A customer comes up swipes their card and enters pin number. Bam the thief now has all that information. 
Just keep an eye on your QR codes/scanners for tampering.

Question. 
It's been a while since I last bought some. But I use Coinbase, if I were to buy some right now will I get it at the price shown right now and how long does it take for the BTC to show in my wallet? 
Also, because it's at $1080 right now as I'm asking this, if in a few hours it's back up closer to $1200 can I sell them right away at the $1200 price? 
Or will it take a few days to process and what not? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:44:49
Yeah, I guess you're right. That sucks. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:37:56
Yes. 
Directly linking a bank account allows for Coinbase to withdraw/deposit straight into it. 
You should get a $2,500 weekly buy limit and a $50,000 weekly sell limit once you do that. 
I remember a few years ago if you have a VISA credit card you could instant buy/sell any limit but I don't see that option anymore which kinda sucks but whatever. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:33:31
Right now it is at $820. 
Tomorrow morning it could be at $700 or $1100. 
So do what it best for you. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:34:06
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:30:43
That's weird.

@_date: 2016-12-23 06:35:16
Yup. I haven't bought or sold any since april of 2014.

Maybe, not sure. 
I set all of mine up a few years ago and I am at work. I should be home in about an hour and can check the desktop site out to hopefully be able to direct you to the part where you can add a bank account and increase your limits. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:30:35
Dang, that's about $1,200 more total. 
Is it easy to set up an account with them to get the money transfered directly into my bank account?
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:53:10
You can increase it by $100 by verifying your ID under the credit/debit card section. 
But not really worth it. 
I haven't really used coinbase in a few years until tonight. But could of sworn a few years ago it you have a visa credit card you could have a $50,000 buy/sell limit.

Sold 4 on tuesday, was going to sell my other 4 yesterday when the price went up another $100, but decided to wait until it broke over $1200. 
Now I think I'll wait until over $1300. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:27:42
Yeah, I just tested it was $5 worth. Got a email from coinbase saying the transfer was successfully and should be available for trade within 30minutes. 
Only worry I have now is, I sent sent that $5 to a wallet starting with Wq***, Now it's saying my wallet address is 1B9***. 
So I am still worried about transferring the full amount. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:14:15
I was literally just told this was a scam, so why should we trust this? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:36:05
Well now I have a somewhat different problem. 
I transfered $5 worth to my coinbase account. 
So my multibit wallet shows exactly 3.99438525 coins remaining. 
So I typed that exactly into the send window and it is saying I do not have that amount to send. 
Tried going to 3.9943852 and said the same thing. 
Is this normal? 
EDIT: got it to go through at 3.994. So I got 26 cents left over. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:20:46
Well if you're like me and are a massive idiot you sell right before the fucking rise. 
Stupid $1200. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:53:30
Yeah, I had finally got my coinbase account setup so I could do some instant buys/sells with the USD wallet. 
I noticed that it dropped twice over a two week period and figured I would sell once it got close to 1200 then rebuy when it dropped again. 
Sold, and the price has only been going up and up and up and up and up. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:01:06
Sold at $1200, jokes on you!
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:31:34
Don't forget the UK. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:13:26
Yes actually , they only accept visa. If you verify a credit card you can get instant buys.
Generally 4 business days through Coinbase if you don't have instant buying. I bought two last night myself, though I almost couldn't. Got locked out on my phone and another computer, and it said I would not be able to log in for 24hours. Got home, checked my desktop and it worked, bought two when it hit $690. Expecting them sometime next week. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:14:44
Awesome, thank you. So far this is exactly what I was thinking of earlier tonight. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:56:25
Technically, yeah they could. But I doubt Argentina or Zimbawee has the technology capable of destorying satellites. The countries that do have that capability are more than likely keeping this hidden incase of war.
Think the U.S really wants Russia knowing how they can blow up satellites, so they can come up with a defense for it?

Judging by the significiant leaps in space related technologies and the multiple articles of private companies wanting to go to Mars and such.

@_date: 2013-12-08 21:41:12
I would go with all the conventional ways, contacting the media, flyers, word of mouth. I've told a few people at work already about your dealership accepting them, though they don't know really what Bitcoins are yet. 
One is very interested in the entire concept of a decentralized banking industry, and having access to his money when he wants it. 
I think if by accepting payment in the form of bitcoins and your dealership save's money from credit card fee's and what not more and more local businesses will make the move.
After-all, if there is something that increase's a businesses profits they will go for it. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:01:23
Ugh, I just want to buy some right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:54:32

Can the FBI spend the siezed bitcoins?
They must have seized alot of them and prices have been going up. What happens down the road when bitcoins are at say $2,000 each and the FBI decided to treat it like any other asset's they have seized and sells it. Or like other police agencies that sieze money and use's it to fund there departments.

I'm wondering what they are going to do with the Bitcoins they ave already siezed from certain people. 
Are they going to treat it like an asset fortfeiture and dump the money into there budget? Do they "destroy" the bitcoins like they do with drugs,weapons, and what not. 
Do they auction them off? At what price do they auction them, the price they were when taken, or current price? 
Will they hold onto them in an attempt of making more money in the future when the value goes up? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:26:32
All I can say is, nicee... 
Wether you are going to hold out and wait until the value is higher, sell off now for a MASSIVE profit. Or hell use it as currency and buy stuff directly with Bitcoins.

I thought of something earlier tonight, but I am not sure if it already exist. 
Basically I am always checking the price of BTC and just having to unlock my phone, load up an app/internet page to check the price.
I was thinking about how cool it would be if there was an app of some sort that would show the price on the toolbar, like next to the time/signal strength,battery power and so on. 
This way you don't have to unlock your phone and what ever other security measure you have in place. Just pull it out like you are checking the time. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:57:28
Yea, flipping out I couldnt buy more. 
Plus I don't recieve them until this friday. Coinbase has a 4 business day waiting period. So according to my comfirmation I should recieve my 2 BTC this thursday/friday around midnight. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:19:56
As a business viewpoint accepting payment as BTC and converting instantly to USD/fiat using bitpay would alone bring in huge profits. 
Credit/debit card fee's are enormous in a world where more and more people leave cash. 
If by accepting payment with BTC you avoid those fee's you make a huge gain rght there alone. You also have the chance at publicity of accepting a new form of currency. I know people who go out of there way to find businesses in the area that accept BTC, as a way to show support. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:57:32
What country are you in?
Far as I knew U.S based companies must pay you with legal U.S currency. I know way back some mining companies paid employees with a form of currency they only used and was only accept at store's within the company. This was completely moronic as it limited peoples options to where they can spend there living. 
How ever U.S currency is 100% legal tender and accepted anywhere. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:48:49
I believe the comments is more of, sell 1 or 2 BTC and recoupe all the money you spent building up that 170. Then keep the rest if you want. 
Sounds reasonable to me, you are atleast making sure you do not lose your initial investment while still leaving plenty left over. 
But then again, it is you BTC. Do with it as you wish and have fun. Don't do something you will regret.

I have had this reaction a number of times.
Usually I will ask then if they would be willing to listen for a few minutes with an open mind. I then talk about how you can use TCs, the ideology behind them, market value, the works. 
I explain how the worlds centralized banking industries have been fucking society. How BTC would be a decentralized currency. I explain the amount of money companies would save by avoiding credit/debit card fees. 
Just try to tell them everything you know, if you dont know much learn. 
Dont push it on them, many people feel attacked when you push these things. Calmy explain all the benefits about BTCs.

While i really like your post, and will admit it inspired me there is just problem. 
If Bitcoins were to become this huge, worldwide over. We are talking about an electronic currency that relies on the internet to be traded. Third world nations could not do this, poor neighborhoods would be even poorer. 
Those who could not afford access to technology would be left behind in the essesiantal "Dark ages". 
Now dont get me wrong, I want bitcoins to succeed. To take the world with force as an alternative to centralized currency. A way to reign in power from governments and put it back into the hands of the people. 
But only if it will cause more good than harm.

Thats even better, the more it is used as a form of payment/currency the more businesses will realize that they need to start accepting it. This will cause more growth and generally overall stabilize the market. Hopefully, I really have no clue about any of this stuff at this stage. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:30:45
Why not both?
While using it as a currency, and as an investment
I know people that bought in a  month ago, got a whole bunch at like 100 each, then this pass week bought multiple gift cards at $1,000 each. So thousands of dollars worth of gift cards for a couple hundred dollars. 
Also people invest in fiat, it is just more stable after long time use.

BoA gave it a value of $2,500 I believe but I am at a "Fuck BoA no matter what" stage. 
But yea, bought 2BTC the other night during the "crash" and looking forwards to spending them later on. Have to wait a week until they come in though.

O I understand what happened and everything. Just more pissed that when I can finally make a purchase and the prices are low I get locked out of my account for the next 24 hours.

Check your printer, some printers keep copies of what has been printed on a hard disk. It is possible to reprint your wallet.
If anything for a little over $5,000 right now it is 100% worth the time. Hell take your computer/printer to some form of tech support and see if they can get it reprinted.

Sire, mine too was of the humerous nature.

Fuck coinbase. Was sitting here all day watching the price just drop and drop and drop. I finally got my bank account verified after a few days of waiting. Now I am seeing the prices just fall. 
I go to buy and coinbase is down. So I try on my phone, nope not working. I go back to my computer and it locked me out for the next 24 hours. 
ugh.

what if they treated this case as an asset forfeiture?

Even if business owners vewed it as another form of a debit card they should still be more receptive. Not having to pay the fee's associated with credit/debit cards will save them a small fortune.

Was disappointed with the 745 cnn segment. They did a small intro, paul talked about its potential to collaspe the dollar. Was hoping for more.

Yea a visa credit card. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:37:02
Yea, bought two this past friday night.

Dang, I was just looking into grabbing a VISA card just to start doing instant buys with Coinbase. 
As it is now I bought 2BTC this past Friday night and I am waiting until this Friday until I recieve them. According to coinbase atleast. Good thing is they have'nt taken the money from my account, hopefully they take it out upon deliverly. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:25:05
Yup on the BoA thing, and thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:22:44
This makes no sense.

I am predicting prices of $1,000 by the 12/14/2013.

I am not sure about the difficulty of recovery and such for finding lost wallets. But I have been seening quite a few post related to people asking for help to recover lost wallets/BTC. Either damager harddrives, wiped, reformatted and such.
But in all honesty, some of the post saying they have 2-5 in your case, others with more and sometimes alot more. At the current price of $917 a BTC in your case that is $1,834-$4585. Is it not worth the money to take your computers/HDD to a expert and pay them to retrieve this information? 
But this is completely me, my knowledge of recovery is far from me being comfortable enough to risk losing this amount of money.
