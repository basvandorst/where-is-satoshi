Not copy paste, and also Charlie has done a great deal in the space.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:20:06
True, but the amount of people, mainly those new to crypto, who'll be exposed to this junk really worries me!
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:21:56
Bought this, listened to it once (It was shit) Just so I had somewhere to spend bitcoin back in the day. Still, good work Fiddy!
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:19:44
Me too! the only thing I've seen that is worse than Dentacoin was for an aquarium raising money via an ICO. Took Whaleclub to a whole other level!
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:31:29
Yup Bitpay. 
Just checked back to see if there was an address and there wasn't. 
On the plus side, the order confirmation begins with 
Ayo Franke, what's up it's 50!
Fiddy doesn't care for business formalities, he's a G!
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:06:03
Well, that explains why he's been so quiet!
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:16:52
Yet another blow to there pipe dream that is BU. I can almost see Ver crying as he realises his plan is shit and no one wants it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:22:00
Ver is sending a legal representative for BU : 
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:26:47
Oh, you should see the amount they are spending on Upvotes and Reddit comments a day too!

How are scammers going to survive without Roger's endless flow of coins? They'll have to find someone new to rip off.
I'll be pleased to see the angry man child leave the scene. Don't let the door hit you on the way out Rogey!

I can’t believe we’re still talking about this irrelevant waste of space.

"Those who are thinking about depositing some bitcoin into a BitKong savings account will need to ask themselves if an 8 percent annual return makes up for the possibility that the anonymous owners of the gambling platform could run away with the funds tomorrow."

Don't believe the hype, North Korea are not mining Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:38:49
They have changed their tune: [

Craig is a dick, but aside from the Satoshi claims, he's been involved in bitcoin way before that.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:04:52
It's going to make for uncomfortable dining if one of them accidentally drops a fork!
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:46:36
Good work on keeping the streets clean!

More Bitcoinist content that has been paid got but is not marked as sponsored !
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:46:18
Agreed! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:26:16
Agreed! I was really positive about the project when it first launched but it's really lost its way. See also (Yours) and Ryan X Charles who's obviously being funded by someone heavily backing Bcash
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:26:39
Me too! I've used equipment from most of the mining companies, my first being a KNCminer and nothing came close to Spondoolies. They were awesome and rack mountable!

Google never really enforced their ban. I run ads for several companies in the space and none of them were banned/ paused. This could just be that Coinbase paused their ads for other bands (The price of bitcoin etc.) and have now decided to reactivate them.

He was meeting with Aussie regulators before that. He's still a dick, but has been around (being less of a pain in the arse) for longer than people imagine.
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:29:18
The Talkboy was a soft fork of the Sony Walkman
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:58:27
Maybe he is going to launch an ICO for Fishsticks ?
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:58:35
7./ Hahahaha!
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:28:06
When mun?
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:51:47
He's biding his time, chilling with Tupac
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:12:32
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:00:04
I am hoping he comes back briefly in the last episode of the season, or for a few scenes just to wrap the Jian Yang plot up. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:27:44
Start of the next economic crisis? This one's been brewing for a while now.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:48:45
Most with any common sense do!
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:30:20
Try trading on Kraken, it's even worse! Their customer service is garbage too.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:35:19
Approach with caution and understand that this could just be a PR excercise. The company has been shady in the past and personally I wouldn't trust them to pay!
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:32:02
Their founder is still a criminal though ! 
More than likely just signalling segwit as a way to sway public opinion
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:29:23
They might be signaling Segwit, but don't forget that the company is still run by a bunch of scammers:
