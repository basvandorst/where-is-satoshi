I was never defending Tether. It's not a binary pick a side situation. I was linking to a post from Tether were they talk about an audit, and I was doing this in response to the "Y NO AUDIT?!" posts. 
I'm obviously not linking to that page anymore because of the recent news.
It's strange how many people jumped on calling me a shill simply for linking to Tethers website. In a discussion about Tether's audit I was the only person who actually linked to the last official statement they made about it.. seemed relevant to me.

It told us they are in the middle of an audit. Or do you not believe that either?

Whilst there are no hard statistics about crime growth and crime "marketcap", I'd imagine it's pretty big. With cash being faded out, what other fungible currency will criminals use to store and transact their burgeoning illegal funds?

I think you'll find that miners do NOT have the full transactions, just the merkle root of those TX. Without the TX a valid block cannot be broadcast.

"Periodic audits of our bank balances have been performed by the Taiwan-based auditing firm TOPSUN CPAs &amp; Co.  The results of those audits were for the benefit of shareholders and were not in a form suitable for public consumption (to begin with, they were in Mandarin). Nonetheless, we have asked them to prepare the following attestations (PDFs linked) in English, for release to the community, covering December 31, 2016; January 31,2017; February 28, 2017; and, March 31, 2017."
"As we are no longer banking in Taiwan, and given that we are achieving substantial scale, we have engaged Friedman, LLP, in New York, to perform comprehensive balance sheet audits on a quarterly basis going back to Dec 31, 2016. We will share those results with you as they become available in the coming weeks or months."

Honestly, looking at your post history, your opinion is basically worthless. Your account is 1 week old and all you do is post bearish stuff in Bitcoin subs, but with more knowledge than a 1 week old account would ever have.

@_date: 2018-01-27 19:34:15
Well done for making a post that isn't just "shill account". Still, took you 5 days to get in here, but since you are trying a little harder, here's a response:
If they have never had an audit done, why did they post a mid audit report? Was that entirely a lie? Did they retract the post and say that it was false? Why did you feel the need to include "paid" for an audit, rather than just saying they've never had an audit? Is another company paying for an audit for Bitfinex? 
Who is this Stu Hoegner. You are going to have to give me some actual proof that both a) he's relevant and b) that's his actual number. Also, you might want to remove the number regardless, as I'm pretty sure it falls foul of reddit doxxing rules.

No I'm saying that pools should pay their miners the TX fees. Any pool that doesn't pay TX fees is a borderline scam IMO.
To clarify, pools like Bitcoin.com are actually directly profiting from high fees much more than fair pools like slush. Since Bitcoin.com keeps the majority of the TX fee, they could be getting an extra 5 or more BTC each time they mine a block.

Yet you go to Bitcoin.com and it makes the claim that it's the highest paying Bitcoin pool. They pay 10% "extra" but don't pay TX fees, which are much more than 10% of the blockreward.

GPL requires the source code to be made available.
From the document: 
" if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights."
When I bought an s9 it didn't mention the GPL anywhere. It also didn't come with any source code, or a way to get the source code, for all the software shipped (not just cgminer).
Bitmain are in blatant violation of the GPL. I hope their upcoming IPO makes them clean up their act.

By workers rights I mean things like sick pay, maternity leave (for both male and female) and a minimum wage for all workers.
There are a lot more benefits than just getting the 30 days required holidays per year, but of course that is nice. Your comment is telling though, and I can tell you don't manage people for a living. Running your staff into the ground is a good way to have high turnover, not high productivity.
You talk about economic literacy but don't you see that if I moved to the US I would be worse of economically purely because I'd have to pay for health care.

Free market capitalism + democracy will always lead to lobbying and concentration of power and wealth. It seems unavoidable to me unless you regulate heavily, and then it's not free market capitalism anymore.

LN is a new technology that is only going to get better, and BTC fees are actually really low right now.
From that graph you can see that BCH and BTC fees are in the same order of magnitude. If BCH and BTC "flipped" BCH fees (in USD) would be higher than BTC fees (in USD). The "super high fees" thing a) isn't really true right now and b) is irrelevant really, because if BCH had the usage and price of BTC it's fees would rise.

Personally, after reading the various pull requests related to this issue (going back to analytics being added), I'm "ok" with this.
The money will be used to pay contributors and run the site, which is not cheap (there is a breakdown in one of the pull requests). We need to accept that large sites like bitcoin.org will not be run as a charity and they _need_ to make money if they are to continue providing a service. 
As was stated in the pull requests, a clear cut sponsership deal like this that provides a clear service (advertising their service) is much better than a vague "grant" from one company, which makes bitcoin.org reliant on a single companies kindness to keep running.

I watched a video by Greg Maxwell where he states that incremental improvements were made to the software to reduce orphans, but most miners only upgraded when Segwit forced them too. This is why we basically saw no orphans after August 1st.. previous to that miners were using node software that was years out of date, and after August everyone was forced to update.
Wish I could remember the name of the talk as it was very interesting.

The assumption that banks will have positive interest rates in 10-40 years might not turn out to be true.

Perhaps not to you, but it does to a lot of other people.

BCH was forked because segwit would break a type of ASICBOOST that was in use in some large pools. The use of ASICBOOST by these pools made the mining operation significantly more profitable, so large miners resisted (for years) the SegWit fork, which would remove their advantage.

You are living in crypto-bubble-tinfoil-hat land my friend.
Go outside and talk to real people.

Did you read the post? 


This attack is completely nullified by using a trusted server (preferably one you host yourself).
I agree it's a bad bug though.
