[Bitaddress]( is a tool which can generate addresses for you (do it offline if you are going to try). One of the pages is "Bulk Wallet" which can generate a lot of addresses (10,000+ they recommend). At the bottom of that page are some instructions for "How do I use a Bulk Wallet to accept bitcoins on my website?"

The Bitcoin version has been on the Promotional graphics page since January...

*Also*: Half of the people this will affect have £20,000 in their accounts....which kind of begs the question why they haven't paid their taxes.

Bitcoins aren't managed by banks. Look in the sidebar


The main issue is the if a financial corporation has the political power to make the rules, they can do what they want (with your money, with no repercussions).

Sticking with the "because MtGox is gone" thing, I wouldn't be surprised that the loss of MtGox caused people to be wary of trading large amounts, or even trading in general.

I haven't started yet. Unfortunately I've been very busy with exams.

To quote from the [Bitcoin Wiki](


So if I'm under 1kB, and adding a single Satoshi keeps me under the 1kB, the minimum transaction fee is *constant*.
In my previous comment I was wrong, the crossover is 0.1mBTC/1kB transaction.
In Satoshis:
The minimum TxFee is 10000 Satoshis
So to transfer 0.1mBTC (10000), the fee is 1 Satoshi per 1 Satoshi Transferred.
Now add one Satoshi, the fee is 10000/10001 ~ 0.9999 Satoshis per Satoshi Transferred.

That sounds like an awesome way of handling subscriptions

If anyone decides to use nmap, I wrote a script to do auto checking of port 49150
You can get it [here]( (I claim no responsibility if you get in trouble)

Please explain then.
**I agree**, for small transaction totals, adding 1 satoshi will cost more than 1 satoshi.
But for larger transactions, adding 1 satoshi costs less than 1 satoshi.
This crossover is at about 1BTC/1kB transaction at low priority.

How about with online gaming subscriptions (e.g. MMOs). From the moment you login to the moment you logout.
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:20:50
No, but it means you aren't spending more than you're sending. (Assuming the larger outputs have a legitimate purpose and not just change) 
Assuming the transaction is under 1000bytes, and we have the minimum transaction fee of 0.1mBTC.
If I send just 1 Satoshi, that's 0.1mBTC to send 0.00001mBTC 
If I send 1BTC along with 1 Satoshi, thats, 0.1mBTC to send 1000.00001mBTC 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:52:47
In fact, assuming I was going to make the larger transaction+fee anyway, the additional satoshis would get a free ride (so long as the fee doesn't increase).
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:46:50
Regarding the cost of transmission: there's nothing stopping you from having multiple outputs to reduce the fee/output.
Of course this would only apply in cases where you *could* bundle your transactions in this way.
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:05:29
Even if the 1 Satoshi output(s) is (are) bundled together with outputs which are significantly larger?
