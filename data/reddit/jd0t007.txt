Which is why optimally you'd want to run your own node or hash on a node close you to to reduce DOA &amp; orphans as much as possible

Actually Ghash &amp; uninformed/suicide-miners are creating a problem, I'm having a conversation with someone online about the possible implications of that problem. The fact that you have to put consistently before both of your points is my point.


This is basically what our conversation is about. I'm not convinced though.
So your basically saying be reactive instead of being proactive?

Ok, lets say in this situation everything is as you say. 20PH farm 30PH worth of other users equipment all on one pool at what point do you take precautions against a single point of failure or a single point of attack? 
Thats like having a database or any information for that matter on a single drive, saying that its cheaper "hardware wise" to keep all the info on one drive vs investing in a RAID 1 or 5 setup while totally writing off that if anything did happen, the amount of time and energy/man hours ect spent getting everything online would totally dwarf any money that you saved in the first palace.
IMHO this is all GIOCEX faults anyway they should have denied new users and imposed fees on existing users to level the playing field once they re-captured 40+% of the network

I mean do what you said you would do in a situation like this
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:50:02


Fair enough, where are you mining now?
@_date: 2014-06-15 13:05:41
Its not the end of the world of a pool has 50%+ of the hashing power. Its just the end of decentralized confidence in bitcoin 
We're playing on the world stage with a disruptive technology thats got old money's attention it's not if it's when. BTW the farm is by its self is big enough to be the largest pool even if everyone left. The purpose of mining is to secure the network mining with 50+% is not securing the network. 
The bigger issue may be that mining co-ops have bought hardware when the price of bitcoin was high and have to make good on
payments now that bitcoin is half as valuable so most of the big players
feel they have no where else to go for profits. 
This is BS because you can have the best of both worlds (not a centralized threat to the network while still getting money) just from a properly configured P2Pool node at the co op location.

If p2pool.io has high latency for you, you can also try  to help find an acceptable node nearest you.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:43:43
Try  or  to help find an acceptable node near you. low latency is important if your not running your own node
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:42:09
also try  or 
to help find an acceptable node near you.

I'll be sure to check it out! Thanks ForestOG :)
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:21:02
Additionally P2Pool can be configured to merge mine as well

Its not only an issue of having x% of the available hash rate on its pool. Its also that Ghash &amp; CEX have a farm in addition to the pool and you'd have to be delusional to think the farm isn't being expanded in addition to having a large pool. There is no proof of how large this farm is. What I worry about is what if all the people pointing miners leaving the Ghash pool makes no difference over if Ghash &amp; CEX owns a remaining hash rate of over 30%. Bitcoin wasn't designed have trust and be a monopoly at the same time  
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:18:08
Ghash (and all pools for that matter) should police themselves. Currently Eligius &amp; BTCGuild have been block withholding attacked (similar in a way that you've described dealing with Ghash.) Some people are even saying that competing pools are doing this to drive people to Ghash. If thats at all true then that makes moving from Ghash all the more serious.   
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:29:00
After reading what you wrote I have to ask, What do you think a 51% attack is?
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:29:28
OP please check out the following link. 
If thats not enough to convince you to move all your hash rate,  you should consider divvying up your hash rate with the smallest % left to ghash.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:06:38
It's not. Pools have hit close to 50% and proactively raised fees for new miners or halted new sign ups to their pool many times. When actions like these are taken it's not actually a problem.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:11:39


Speculators react to bad news and miners know they are the source of this particular instance of bad news and continue on that course who do we blame then?
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:59:48
Colonel31 We get a lot of reports from people losing their money and Bitcoin into dodgy mining pools
About 51% if I'm remembering correctly only 2 (maybe 3) other pools ever came close to 50%. 1 pool @ 40~% raised mining fees to stop new members from joining and to spread the hash rate evenly against x amount of pools available at the time. Ghash doesn't care so neither do the people who mine there. The Pool should have taken action to curtail this the last time they were at 40+%, but i guess some men just want to watch the world burn

P2Pool has a sharechain across all nodes so basically every p2pool instance is going towards overall P2pool hashrate. At P2pools current share chain diff/distance &amp; latency to a node, it generally doesn't matter where you hash because it will contribute to the P2pool hashrate in the end.
There is a general problem with having smaller miners xGH and xTH on the same node where the xGH users don't have enough hash rate to successfully generate a share in that situation, but its possible to tier miners as well.
totally agree with not going to P2Pool.org
Try  or 
to help find an acceptable node near you.

Miners should track their payments by pay-period.  5BTC is 5BTC it shouldn't matter if your paid 21 times vs 7 times in a 7day period if a secure network/higher perceived value is the only difference between the two. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:37:38
You do realize that its not just "a stable currency" but a whole infrastructure that being damaged by these actions right? Even if mining at GHash to ROI was your strategy. Prior to and past your point of ROI your contributing to mining centralization, which decreases confidence which in turn decreases the price which makes your position in bitcoin/mining hardware worth less.
