Not true, this chart is only ten blocks behind. Even if Ghash.io mined all ten of those blocks it would only bring them up to 40.4%.

It sounds like they didn't approve this one though

The explanation is on the homepage: 
Pretty much, blockchain.info uses the source IP address that first relayed the block which isn't accurate. This monitors the internal ledger that the pools have of the blocks that they have solved.

Is there going to be a hard fork in the Bitcoin Core? If there is, how is that going to be handled and what are the changes? I know I have read in the past about infinite block sizes, and other features. Any other that your considering, blacklists, etc.?

Probably coinkite, they have a point of sale device which I don't think coinbase or bitpay has. Check them out:

I mean it sucks, the only things that come to mind about this decision are negative ones. Really though, why would anybody in the right mind think that this is a good idea to outsource something like this? I mean I thought it was bad when Coinbase leaked all customer email addresses and full names but come on, this is terrible judgement and I will not be storing any of my Bitcoin with them.

How are the USB ports on the monitor connected to the computer? Most of the time, monitors require an additional USB cable to connect the USB ports to the computer (which would mean you have atleast one working USB port).

Were they correct about megaupload?
