just got back from the bank with my paper wallet in hand... now off to mother's house we go to store the wallet in her safe... I'm sure she'll look at me with bewilderment when I ask her to store it for me :)

I'm on a mac and just create a truecrypt container, inside that container I put all my bitcoin and secret data.  Then I created a encrypted .dmg file using disk utility.  I put all my wallet data in there.  then put that encrypted .dmg file in the truecrypt container for double protection.
Then I always recommend using a HIDDEN truecrypt container if you are hiding something that can get you in trouble... then you can (if forced) just provide the password to the outer container so you can protect all your data.
Then I just wrote a quick automater script that will open my truecrypt container, turn on tor, mount my bitcoin encrypted .dmg container.
Works pretty darn well for me.
My deep freeze wallet is a simple paper with the private/public keys written on it (using a quick filemaker program I made) then I store that paper in a VERY secure place.

US / BTC... my point was who would trust their currency to an online only source...
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:13:30
I've since stopped using a Bank and now have a better (for me) method...
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:53:19
ahh... I got ya... I'm just a very small tadpole in this here digital pond...

site is down 
@_date: 2012-11-08 17:38:38
Ok after speaking the bitinstant rep I think I'm sorted out.  My understanding now is that the "estimate" I was provided was 1-2% off what I actually was going to receive.  all is understood now.
@_date: 2012-08-29 14:23:04
ahh... interesting point... hmm... do you think that's the same for a credit union?
I'm still curious why anyone would trust their bitcoins to a online wallet..  it baffles me.
@_date: 2012-08-29 14:01:20
who the hell keeps their bitcoins online!?!?!  holy shit batman!  I keep mine in an encrypted container on my computer, then use multi bit.  That container is backed up to 3 places.
Every 250 Bitcoins I get I print them out on a paper wallet and drive that down to the bank where it sits nice and safe in my SD box.
I feel for ya buddy but really.... who's to blame here?  I think you know the answer if you think about it.
@_date: 2012-08-29 16:09:35
yup... I wonder if I could use the jpg encryption method on a printed jpg?  I'd have to test that out but I doubt it would work.
I guess nothing beats an encrypted USB stick...
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:33:59
wouldn't this be the same as the btc just disappearing?  it doesn't hurt the community in the long run as the value of a btc would simply increase?
@_date: 2012-11-08 15:30:19
you can see in this screen shot they advertise 1.99%
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:22:34
that's a thought... I guess I'm the only one who's not buying up btc and trading them often....  I gather them to purchasing things online and to hoard them.... but that's just me... I own my own company and don't have much time to play this market... but I wish I did.
@_date: 2012-11-08 16:27:20
Thanks Charlie!  To clarify as you can read above I have tried emailed your support folks several times.
I just shot you an email, I'll update this thread with what we find out.
@_date: 2012-08-29 21:12:28
yes.  Why.... well for me it's because MT. gox want my personal information which is shit.  I use bitfloor.com for my purchases... and I keep my USD in there for about 20 minutes...  I buy at market price though... I guess I could see why people would keep a few bones in the exchange for limit orders.
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:12:33
so, I believe this strengthens the point who in their right mind would ever use an online wallet??
I may be doing it wrong but I use bitfloor.com to get my money from cash to btc in the fastest cheapest way possible.  I don't leave my USD on their site for longer than mere minutes and am baffled why ANYONE would do different.
Can someone explain what benefit is there to storing your hard earned money on someone's exchange when there is not independent security audit preformed on these guy?
I'm by no means the smartest but I can be sure that my coin is safe and sound...
@_date: 2012-09-21 15:54:50
hrmm.... I wonder if people will trust them again?  They sure did offer a nice CHEAP service!
@_date: 2012-08-29 15:16:48
right on... I'll get that done asap.. I already have my mother storing all my backups as well.. what's some paper on top of that!
@_date: 2012-11-08 16:22:51
yes, I can beat 3.99% on bitcoin-otc... but I did bitinstant.com because for this trans they offered 1.99%... so yes, I would like my $2 paid back to me.... more importantly I would like some word from the company so I know what future transactions will cost me... I can pay fees... I just need them to be explained BEFORE I pay my money...
@_date: 2012-09-21 20:31:23
Cool!  
Also, check out  which does the same thing "perhaps slower" for free...
You can also download the java file and run it from your computer so no trust will be needed.
@_date: 2012-11-08 20:04:58
I have updated this thread accordingly.  Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2012-09-04 19:09:56
anyone have any good alternatives to bitfloor that charge as little as they did?
@_date: 2012-09-13 13:55:35
I miss bitfloor.com...  
@_date: 2012-11-07 18:48:37
I also stated that I would place an update when I get one.  I did not misunderstand what their website stated..
@_date: 2012-11-02 21:51:28
every single hack on mtgox I've heard about were caused by poor user security...
@_date: 2012-09-07 17:06:35
I shot them a few coins... These guys are great... My main source for reports and understanding new RCs
@_date: 2012-09-04 18:51:25
ouch... I feel for ya... hope all works out well for you.
@_date: 2012-09-12 18:18:01
everyone should now research Truecrypte Hidden volumes... would come in very handy if this actually happens
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:09:43
Thanks every one.  I'm checking out the links and have been "accepted" on The acceleration tool.  I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:58:56
brain wallet baby!  with a really really really (easy to remember) long password.
I almost lost 14 coins due to a program bug in my btc client the other day but after the dev got them back for me I moved them into a brain wallet for safe keeping.
congrats buddy!
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:21:21
and I hope you declined to go to the cop shop for a voluntary interrogation.

One of my biggest issues with tipping is how everyone is asking for one now-a-days....
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:40:54
Yes, I must praise Gary here.  He saved my coins for me and didn't even take my bounty!  I'm new to reddit but 1+ or what ever to this guy because he saved my ass!
@_date: 2013-07-24 17:15:11
People still use Dropbox!?!
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:37:21
pywallet doesn't work with multibit from what I understand :(
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:17:39
people still use dropbox?  I thought that was so 3 years ago... I've moved on to better solutions that I run myself...
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:29:25
no, multibit doesn't allow for wallet encryption, just encryption of the exported keys.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:36:28
if this is the case then I'm a big enough person to admit that I said what I did without knowing all the facts.
@_date: 2013-07-24 17:13:14
IMHO Spideroak is a pricey joke... there are many better solutions out there...  I personally like Crashplan.com as I can host my own backup servers so I do not rely on the companies servers being up.  Also, I had issue with Spideroak not rebuilding a backup during restore properly... Of course there are several ways to do this for free using open-source software as well for the initiated.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:37:30
thanks so much, I now see that and am clear... kinda sucks that I'm charge a fee when I buy AND sell...  makes it harder to make a lot of micro deals and make money....
@_date: 2013-01-02 22:21:12
wow, thanks all for the great explanations! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:44:19
just wanted to say that the devs of the software are hard at work fixing this issue, these guys are fantastic!
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:36:33
thanks, you pulled the link before I could!
never talk to police NEVER!
