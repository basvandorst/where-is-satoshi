No, I get all my BTC from bitcoinget and have had all but like 30 cents of it for months. I am trying the resetting thing now
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:05:25
Restarting worked. Thanks :3
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:02:26
You're evil. I like that. :p
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:09:59
Where do you live where three donuts are $1.05? Wish they were that cheap here, hehe.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:33:09
Newbie here, what is this 'whale' term that keeps getting thrown around?
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:34:56
Or a middle eastern literary hero.
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:47:32
I don't have a job. I live with someone else, who while doing okay, can't afford to make investments all willy nilly. 
Most of my "income" is beer money related.
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:01:05
There is a natural tendency in all men to evil. 
Given the chances super wealthy have to be evil, and given the government standard of taking bribes/etc...
There needs to be a fix. Communism is out because again, we just aren't able to be fair. Most want to feel superior in some way to someone else.
But what that fix could be...your guess is as good as mine.

The Fraggles had a good idea. "We each lead ourselves and we all lead each other."
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:08:20
What happens when the item is 1¢?
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:46:37
Thanks! That 10¢ option looks good.
@_date: 2014-11-02 05:27:52
This is why we can't have anything nice. Trolls gotta ruin everyone's day.
@_date: 2014-10-11 07:10:10
Of course. I mean, a little at a time, especially when BTC is under $400, seems like a good idea.
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:03:36
Here, have an up vote for making me laugh.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:36:44
A little panic is all the gubmint folks need to get what they think will give them what they want.
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:21:59
I'm sure someone else has said it, but I will anyway.
THAT'S THE IDEA!
@_date: 2014-10-11 08:13:33
I've tried posting, but since all I can do is edit/proofread or do creative writing or product reviews...and I do this on a tablet, I have yet to get an order.
But I'll give a try. Thank you. :)

If it happens again there'll probably be a heavy uptick of Bitcoin faucet use.
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:35:43
It's because you can do a charge back way too easily with credit cards.
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:56:13
I've already been using faucets. I don't plan on mining, just buying Bitcoin in small amounts.
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:48:20
Not to mention the value keeps going up two and down three. If they want Doge to go up they need to restrict supply more. Burning doge does no good if the river keeps rushing out new ones.
@_date: 2014-08-31 03:22:00
You're right on that. Compared to the doge tip bot, anything looks like they don't tip. That thing is AGGRESSIVE.
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:46:16
$1 or less, and the US.
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:59:38
This made me giggle for some reason. Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:57:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:52:01
I don't have a lot of money to spare, so 10¢ to $1 is all I can do.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:10:16
It just does that. It's been that way for like 20+ years.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:30:47
And that is hella hard to do! Whooo Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:46:58
This is what I do when I have work on fiverr. Even if I'm doing it $4 per day, I don't want that $4 a day to pile up to $40 and PayPal suddenly putting a hold on it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 12:34:41
Personally it dims my view, but I don't use exchanges currently anyway. I'm suspicious, as anyone should be--if you have to be optimistic, be cautious about it. It's good to be a little paranoid once in a while.

Aslan calls all times soon.

What is a bank run?
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:25:10
Thanks for the ELI5 explanation. And you're right,  it does look like a "market correction."
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:09:58
I don't see why this doesn't encourage more legalization and taxation. They can still get you for DUI on a drug, so what's the issue?
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:32:50
You could feature Tyrion and R2D2!
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:33:29
Not to mention for the poor shmucks who get their btc from faucets. Freebitco is at 1,000 satoshi an hour right now, and I figure, hey, btc will stay down a while, and when it goes back up, that'll be good for everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:09:15
I too think this way. You have coke and sell it online, thus avoiding dangerous tweakers.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:24:26
I realize there may be tweaks you've meant to make for awhile. Fine, I get that you'd think since everything is down right now, it's a great time to take care of the other stuff too!
Just don't freaking ADVERTISE IT in the middle of a big debacle with everyone wondering if their btc is going to be there when you finally DO reopen, if you even open at all!
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:45:06
I have known ONE person to get a win over as a seller. And that was after a couple rejections over the issue and EXTENSIVE proof of her having been scammed.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:19:40
If they tweet, there'll probably be lots of angry replies. They're trying to pretend there aren't any, I'm guessing.
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:48:32
Cool rebuttal bro.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:43:18
What's hilarious is that this topic is right next to the one where the guy says he will shower if BTC goes &lt;$130.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:35:18
Live on kerbal, do you? :p
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:23:49
Too bad for us android users.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:36:43
Can you define "hot wallet" for a confused newb?
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:26:51
Have an upvote for your troubles.

It's what we call income that is not significant. In other words it is enough money to support buying beer but not much else.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:18:43
How would that help them? Just curious.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:34:50
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:55:56
I always wondered what a ddos was. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:28:15
Hi. :) 
Been doing a beermoney site but they stuck me with a bogus flag on my cf work so the bits are flowing in rather slowly of late.
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:42:27
Hmm, now I know why not to use exchanges...
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:30:23
You won't have brought me down. Every week or so I start to prepare a tx just to check what the fees are. This is so I don't get shocked at the end result. I'm also going to stop using faucets.
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:22:54
There's a big difference between mostly dead, and all dead. Please open its mouth.

At least zynga deserves to be gouged

I'm actually hoping to save for a laptop from newegg! :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:21:46
Omg, thanks :)
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:37:07
What did Levison do?
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:48:30
No, I know that my WM has one. I'm just wondering if this BTC thing is in all of them.
Plus my tablet doesn't seem to like their search results page.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:44:56
What's the worst is that James Marsters, the guy who played Piccolo (a DBZ fan, by the way) had to make a fuss to even make them make Piccolo GREEN. They were going to just let him not be green.
I thought Beerus was adorable. Considering how often cats destroy things...yeah, it makes sense for a god of destruction to be a cat. Whis... Whis was amusing, is all I can say.

Bitcoinget. It's only got crowdflower, videos, and a small offer wall though.
 Bitcoinget.com
Or if you feel nice, my ref link is below

How do I find out if it is available in my local walmart’s WF? I see "select" branches and it makes me wonder.
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:53:40
Another live action movie? No thanks.
Toriyama actually made Battle of the Gods to make up for the utter travesty that was Evolution...I'm not optimistic about this one even if creators are different.
