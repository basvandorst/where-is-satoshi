How about a place of BTC in our lives? You can find lots of interesting facts below. When everybody is trying to buy Bitcoins we are trying to understand whether Bitcoins can play a big role in our life? We mean, how can we use them in real life and why we buy them.
As Bitcoin has no central bank its supply is decentralized. Simply put, It is not like dollars, pounds or even gold, you can’t touch them. Then why do we eagerly want to buy them and how can we spend them?
First of all, this kind of digital currency transaction are private and secure. It is ensured by the fact that no third party can take part in the transaction. This can provide cryptocurrency with a bright future.
You may say “How can I spend bitcoins?”. Don’t worry, bitcoin can already be accepted in numerous shops, websites and companies all over the world.
The number of companies accepting bitcoin payments has increased over the last few years. For example, Microsoft and travel website Expedia both accept bitcoin as a means of payment. 
Cryptocurrency has also found favor in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. One interesting fact, Icelandic singer Bjork is also accepting bitcoin payments for her latest album. 
You see, crypto has made huge steps all over the world. Jack Lawson from New York bought a modern bed for his new flat on Overstock with Bitcoins. Another crypto holder, Tracey Blomfield from the UK, chose the Xbox 360 on Newegg and payed BTC for it. Sounds fascinating, doesn’t it? 
So, you can see that consumers may pay with their BTC on many popular websites. Besides that, Bitcoins can be accepted when paying for an education. Paul Birch pays BTC for his education at the University of Cyprus each year and Donna Atwood also uses BTC for similar payments at King’s College in North Carolina.
One more amazing fact, in parts of Asia, Bitcoin is already being accepted as payment for utilities. Wanzi Lee from China pays for her gas, water, and electric bills using Bitcoins, without having to convert into yuan. Japan is also keeping up with the times. Their consumers can buy electronics with BTC at the largest electronics stores in the country. This is the way Akira Tanaka from Tokyo bought her second TV in a big local electronics store.
After all the controversial questions and strong doubts brought about by cryptocurrency it is quickly being included in our life and will help us to live faster and more comfortable lives.

Dear hillboy, that is said about mobile apps, please do not mix it, web and mobile apps are not the same thing at all.

Hi everyone!
First, we'd like to thank RandomRandom for giving us some free PR - it always warms our heart.
Regarding web wallet security issues - well, a web wallet is a web wallet, the security technology is totally different from the app one. We do not conceal the information about the technologies that we use to protect our web wallet - please feel free to visit our site and social media.
We do not store user's private keys from the mobile app and we will be happy to have your feedback about our apps' security. Since Daniel works in Bread (wallet app developer) we are really sad he didn't give our apps a try (how come?)
Finally, have courage to either publish this article (it's a draft now) or delete it forever.
Discussing a text that is undergoing massive editing right now is weird and certainly not cool.
Cheers from Lumi!

We say it sends your mnemonic through https then we create a wallet and store the wallet encrypted by password. (ONLY IN WEB WALLET VERSION, NOT MOBILE APP)
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:18:10
Web and mobile wallets work separately and differently. 
Lumi web wallet stores wallets encrypted by user password. 
On Lumi iOS and Android private keys are never stored or sent outside of user device.

congrats! If you are interested in question how and where to keep BTC check this article  very informative

We do not consider generating core bitcoin addresses as being year late. You can send to segwit addressess, that works fine. Later we will add user choice which addresses to use.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:54:50
Hello, thank you for trying Lumi and for your feedback! However, let me explain some points you have mentioned.
1. Lumi does not generate Segwit address, that is true, but later we are going to add it.
3. If you are trying to restore BIP 39 it will not work as far as we work with BIP44 derivation path. If you import BIP44 seed it will import its privious activity and adressses.
4.The same story. Lumi supports BIP44, that is why it does't show BIP39 addresses
5. Now Electrum also supports BIP44 that is why it works fine!
Thanks for your review again! We will be happy if you will try Lumi one more time, taking into account all comments I have made and the fact  that we work with BIP44! Hope for your new feedback:) You are always welcome!

Currently,  network traffic is unusually high due to increasing demand for transactions per block. Block sizes are limited, so this means that transactions which exceed the capacity for a block get stuck in a queue for confirmation by miners. The higher fee the higher speed. Never mind it is segwit or not

You need to be sure in privacy and security of your wallet. The best way to keep your crypto is a digital client-side wallet. What is meaning? Client-side wallet guarantees you that no one can be accessed to your private key.
