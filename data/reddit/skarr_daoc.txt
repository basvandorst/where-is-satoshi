Guess I'm in 6th stage then: HODL

Hope you'll get your money soon. 
But I would advise to buy your coins asap and move them out of kraken.
During spike u can forget about getting anything done on their website. one error after the other, sometimes even leading to double orders because you get an error, but your order actually went through

yea,off to bed now. Expect to see it crashed when I wake up :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:12:09
back in 2014
1 full bitcoin at its peak on localbitcoins (730 euros)
then about 2 more on kraken after it crashed (for about 550 euros)
Plan to hodl until I retire (in 20-25 years) or if bitcoin hits 1m, whatever comes first.

Probably hack attempt 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:44:21
I hope your BTC are still there. If it's taking them this long, maybe they got hacked.
