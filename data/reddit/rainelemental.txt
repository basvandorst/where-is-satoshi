no at the moment you only set the price you want to receive the alert, and you get a text message.
I've a private version with phone call, which saved me from one crash that happen overnight :)

Have you noticed that Bitstamp on bitcoinwisdom start to behave in a weird way since the 1st/2nd week of october. 
Zoom out the 1m chart and scroll back, you'll see a lot of gaps between prices, and instead of candles there's a lot of lines to define the price: 
A week ago there were 3-5 minutes of downtime (ddos?). The volume looks like drop incredibly a lot as well, I wonder if this in combination with their recent withdraw issue and order by the gov(?!) to seize and close all the unverified account.
Also can you please confirm that Bitstamp had a recent audit and it was confirmed to be ok?

That means that Bitstamp volume is lowering a lot, that's not a good signal anyway. What about their audit, did they released the results?

Cryptopush seams nice. Anyway I did this app for myself and I'm sharing it for free. In case I'll get donations or more interest I'll consider to expand the functionalities and probably even to release it open source.

So far looks the price is following this analysis, but what I find more interesting is the story of bear whale, I'd like to hear your opinion on it.

I agree in fact I disabled every sounds alerts on my phone, but keep in mind that this is not a sound alert, it's an SMS alert, so you set your alerts and just forget about them, then in hours or day if the price reach your alert price you'll receive an SMS or a phone call. This is useful for example if you plan to buy overnight because you think the price will drop, or you want to sell overnight because the price will go higher.
This works for me, it doesn't mean that have to work for you obviously.
