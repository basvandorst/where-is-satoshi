OP is shitposting to stir up bad decisions, it's all over reddit right now and not just in /controversial. 
Media manipulation at its finest, let's check their user account shall we?


That should tell you all you need to know...

Lol I give a fuck, that's why I sold at 10k and bought ETH. 
Been a bitcoin fan since GPU mining in 2010, paid my rent for a year and bought a car with the proceeds. 
Gave bitcoins to family every year for Christmas. 
The network can't keep up, will never keep up, and the landscape is so fragmented people would rather bitchfest than implement an actual working solution. 
Time to move on folks, you had your chance and you couldn't keep up. 
Satoshidice used to be lambasted as an indirect attack on the network with their insane amount of transactions. 
I told everyone here and in bitcointalk that it was a good test for the future. 
And instead of fixing the protocol, miners just started refusing their transactions...
You made your bed, now lay in it...

Pretty simple, but first you have to create the universe...

Please go away, adults are talking now...

So, how do you propose to fire miners? Send someone to impound their hashfarms?
Fucking delusional...
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:26:39
Only works if the miners agree to it, or are you just going to magically push out a hashside change onto their rigs for consensus without them knowing? 
It's too late now unless we convert the entirety of nebraska into a GPU mine. 


Mined from 2009-2014 and bought my car and paid my rent with them for two years, so yeah. Doubt there is much you can teach me. 
Consensus is only gained through hashpower, you are suggesting that the miners will somehow choose to change their hashvotes to an algorithm that is unsuitable for ASICs?
Or are you saying that we'll out-mine them with GPUs?
Because neither of those make sense my dude...

Bwahahaha! That's what happens when you allow the big boys to take over. 
We told you this back in 2011, but did any of you listen? NoooOOOoo. 
We said 'go to an asic resistant hash', and everyone else was 'Lol what ar u a communist?'
We said 'Concentrating hash power in the hands of a few large players will make the blockchain their bitch', and you said 'lol ok hash harder GPU boy'
We said 'The only way Bitcoin will be stable long term if it is massively decentralized' and you said 'pools will balance' 
And now we're sitting on a huge bubble, and the big boys are playing with the block timing, and not a single person here can do anything about it. 
We warned you, you didn't listen. Enjoy your bubble pop. I know I will.

Are you telling me you don't think bitcoin core devs have been propagandizing their useless management?
Also, what incentive do miners have to change if it means bigger transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:54:07
Fucking markov bots...
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:31:01
This is what happens when a decentralized currency becomes de-facto controlled by an unwanted group of devs with an agenda.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:47:21
Completely agree, wish I had more than 1/20th of a bitcoin left...
