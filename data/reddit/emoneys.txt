Is the battle for bitcoin lost? Long live bitcoins?
If you want my blessing, stop using bitcoins in plural form, it just sounds wrong. But hey, I'm sure you can do without it too ;)

If Bitcoin is to really compete with Western Union, an effort must be made to ensure that Bitcoin has value and is directly exchangable to local currency (preferably cash) in the territories where WU is present.
Between USA and Europe there is no obstable to wire money directly from bank to bank. The problem arises in countries where people do not have bank accounts or have accounts without access to international transfer services.
Consequently, we need "bitcoin agents" in places where access to international exchanges is limited, that is people who value Bitcoin and are willing to pay out local currency for receiving Bitcoin. As long as that entity has access to a local or international exchange I really can't see why there should be a lack of such "bitcoin agents".

This is awesome! Just make sure not to crash...
(sorry, couldn't help myself)
I hope to see the Bitcoin Jet at an airshow in Europe soon!

Being a victim of these scams and thefts is a terrible thing for the affected, but the process of revealing the weak spots in security is a necessary evil to make the whole bitcoin ecosystem evolve and become more robust. As it stands now, the Bitcoin ecosystem is clearly not ready for mainstream adoption yet, and in a weird way we should be thankful to the bad actors that the weak spots are revealed and remedied at such an early stage.
We've come a long way in terms of usability, but clearly we still have a long way to go in terms of robust, decentralized security for "trust-requiring" services like exchanges.

True. Trustless fiat _derivatives_ however (SmartCoins), can be created and traded on the BitShares Decentralized Exchange.

How is a derivative identical to bitcoin?

So, according to you, a decentralized exchange solves nothing? That's the first time I've heard that opinion.
A decentralized exchange decentralizes trust, which is useful. It might not solve what you are after, though.

I'm afraid you're right. However, the verdict is still out. Until a hardfork takes place, Ethereum could still prove itself a solid coin.

I guess it remains to be seen which one is the altcoin. Release the dragons!

Interesting idea. No idea whether it is technically feasible, but interesting nonetheless. How about running a node in a cloud?

If there's a fork, we will end up with two separate networks, and your existing Bitcoin balance will exist on two networks, doubling your total amount of coins. If you assume that both coins halve in price, your total value stays the same. In my view more likely, the combined value will exceed the price of your current bitcoins.

If there is a fork, there will be two bitcoin networks that share the same history, but only up until the time of the fork. From that moment on, if you spend your coins on one network, you can spend them again on the other. Assuming, of course, that both networks survive and has software supporting them.
If you don't control your coins yourself, like keep them on coinbase, I can't tell you what will happen. That would depend on their policy I guess.

No. Encoding in Emojis (7-bit) would require more digits than bytes (8-bit). You could, however, encode a bitcoin transaction in ONE custom "Emoji", a 16x16 icon using 256 colors.

I don't get the fear... Bitcoin holders should rejoice!
With two Bitcoins, even if both lose value, you will double your Bitcoin balance. More likely is that one of them shoots up in value, you still win. Just sit tight and see what unfolds.

Another..? Anyone have links to previous TED talk(s)?
