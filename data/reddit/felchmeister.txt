Because the IRS is an illegitimate organization to start with and cannot lawfully levy taxes against income as per the constitution. Therefor one must assume that the government have no qualms about committing other unlawful acts of oppression as and when they see fit.

Oh it's just the BITCOIN BUBBLE.
Very ironic that the person who coded that used bubbles.
Something tells me they were warning/mocking us in plain site. Which screams that bitcoin is now hijacked by the illuminati as it is their modus operandi to use methods and symbols in the open that only an enlightened few comprehend.

Your government could decide to visit you and demand taxes.
By using Google docs you are giving them enough info to glean your physical identity in meatspace.
For our friends in the US that means the IRS may decide to SWAT you.
And you should note that the US constitution does NOT allow for the taxation of countrymen based on their earnings through labor or otherwise. 
The IRS is essentially an unlawful office of the government working to transfer funds from the US to an offshore fund know as the Federal Reserve.
Too big a topic for here but please do your research.

Basically Jed McCaleb sold Mt.Gox to Mark Karpeles.
Then some hacker got access to Mt.Gox with Jed's admin credentials *after* he was already out of the system and stole shit loads of coins.
And today we see Mark Karpeles doing the same as he did back then.
*Soon after Karpeles took over, Mt. Gox suffered a massive attack. A hacker gained control of McCaleb’s administrator account, the sizable number of Bitcoins therein, as well as the entire user database, and attempted to sell off more than $7 million worth of Bitcoins, driving the price nearly to zero.* **Karpeles panicked and shut the exchange down.**

My coins finally came through. What a long fking day!
My offer would be as follows.

If I cleaned your blocked drains for lunch and a beer am I avoiding taxes? No. I'm bartering with zero profit. A fair trade that the state has no business in.
If I sold you a new toilet seat for $50 when I buy them for $35 then that $15 is profit and would be taxable as consumption tax levied against the retail value of $50. However I do not profit from the installation at all so I would not need to pay tax (according to the US constitution) on my labor costs.
If you decided you wanted to sell your new toilet seat because you liked the cold porcelain in the summer months and you sold it for $50 then do you pay tax?
Consumption tax is a story for another time.
After all by your logic you make it sound as if when money changes hands you must pay a fee to some entity that, by the way, takes that money and gives it to an off shore non-government bank aka the Federal Reserve and never ever hits your economy. And the taxes that you do pay are used to wage endless wars.
One can only assume that day traders enjoy trolling bitcoin.

Yes, the blockchain contains all that info but it is anonymous.

What YOUR government says is law and what is law are actually two different things.
Law and Legislation are two completely different animals. Legislation is a superficial layer obfuscating and clouding Law to facilitate the generation of income for the state through licensing, fines and taxation.

The really short answer is that labor is a running cost and is therefore exempt (not a corporate income) and is therefore not taxable.

If a large portion of their fees are stored in bitcoin then they need to prevent you and me from selling our bitcoins first so as to moneterize their own shit.
They would be called out if they froze the exchange for more than a few hours.
But if they delay your incoming BTC from hitting your account then it's passable as another DDOS/server issue which is utter bullshit as our coins are already confirmed in our MtCoxsux wallets as per the block chain.
My guess is they will wait till Monday or later so they can get cash in the bank from people who are funding their accounts with FIAT as we speak.
Only after that point will our BTC appear as if by Coxsucking magic for us to go wild with.
MtGox have lost my faith completely as both an entry and exit point and as a method of storage / transfer of funds.
The least they could do is fess up and allow us to pull our BTC.
It would work for them too. But oh no ... the fat frenchman is a greedy fuckr.

Nope. If I work for you I give you my time and labor in return for a wage, a fair trade of my effort in return for money or food or board etc. No PROFIT was made. It's a 1:1 barter which is not taxable. If you took the 100 silk screen T-shirts that I printed with "Don't  feed TheAndy500 the troll" and sold them at profit then YOU would have to levy a tax from your cutomers and it would be your responsibility to pay those taxes.

Quit buying and selling. Then you don't get burnt.
Bitcoin is being played by day traders and early miners/speculators.
They don't believe in the long term and they will dump and pump repeatedly for immediate gains.
This last month I gained 40% on my initial investment in the space of a weekend. Then lost half of that the next weekend. But I'm still up on my initial outlay.
But that is not the point.
The point is to invest in as many bitcoins as you can as early as possible and hang on to them. Only banksters, fools and pimping whores daytrade.
Pimp your bitcoins and you will loose them.
Take care of them and they will take care of you.

You need to read up on paper wallets, brain wallets, setting up an offline linux machine to do this on and generally take responsibility for your actions.
Never send more than $10 when testing a transfer to a new wallet. Limit what you put into one wallet. Use multiple paper wallets. EDUCATE THE FAMILY on how to use them in the case of a death etc.
Learn to use the blockchain to track your wallets.
Bitcoin essentially means you become your own banker.
NEVER daytrade.
