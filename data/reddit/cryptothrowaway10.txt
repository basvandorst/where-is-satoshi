Looks like it. I spy with my little eye what appears to be Newbury Street.

Having done some more research, the ATM in this picture could be this: [ Anyone else have reports of these regular ATMs selling bitcoin?

It's both right? That's the whole appeal? That you can withdraw cash from your bank AND buy bitcoin with your debit card.

yeah you don't enter/scan the address using the ATM. you pick the location in the libertyx app. paste your address and it gives you an order  you enter that # in the ATM.

but did you win the claw machine...is the real question

i've been dying to try one of these as i've researched them quite a bit, but haven't made it out to one yet. i did download their app for store locator and account though. it looks like you confirm your phone # and then provide your bitcoin address. you get a code that you enter on the ATM where you enter your purchase amount and the insert your card. it feels very similar to a cash ATM withdrawal, except nothing physical out lol.

Cue "It's Happening" meme ([ I don't see a palm vein scanner, what were the KYC/limits?

Fees? What was the bitcoin price? Is this at all Hard Rock’s? I can always use an excuse to get a new HRC T-shirt :)

They can be lower than 10%. Someone posted a LibertyX debit ATM a few days ago that was 8%. I’ve seen cash ATMs also have promotional deals where it was a few % off. I would think debit should be cheaper than cash due to fewer moving pieces.

seems like there is not much info on them. you could be the guinea pig or try to do a P2P exchange perhaps? are you you in the US?

nice. can't wait till someone takes a video of the transaction so i can see it from beginning to end. beats having to take out cash from an atm first and then using that to buy bitcoin. those withdrawal flat fees really add up.

They don’t let you use coins to buy bitcoin on a coinstar machine..... Am I missing the irony?
