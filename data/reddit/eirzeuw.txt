Most currencies can be manipulated, that's why we have tons of regulations outside of crypto. Whenever there is money involved, there will be people who will try to trick the system.
There are altcoin bots which follow the price of btc, when btc drops, they also sell the altcoin.. you can easily abuse that and make crypto crash anytime you want, if you have enough bitcoins.. they do:)

The King is dead. Long live the King! Going to buy some Bitcoin when it hits 300$

That dude is probably rich now. In his old posts, he is like "im going to hold most of my btc, but let me sell quick like 1000 btc for some cash"

"It is a combination of institutional investors who have been waiting to short BTC for years, alongside mining groups and whales who stanmd to benefit from forcing a pump, crash and then riding the following recovery. "

Oh yes man! Whales doubled the billions they already have  (i think, they have at least 70bn they can move in and out as they wish to and now much more). The good thing for us: We can learn the whales game. They are some greedy moth'' and they want more money. The market cap was kinda stuck at 700bn (means, no fresh money was coming in). That's why they pushed the exit button. Now with the prices down, they will push for new records, this will attract new investors, fresh money comes in until it doesn't, and then they will crash it again. My new strategy: Once new all time highs are reached and the cap is slowing down, i'm getting my shit out and wait in fiat to buy the "dip".

Don't buy now. Every penny you throw in now contributes to the whales game and profits. Just let it fall. The whales caused this crash and they will also stop it, once prices are low enough. Whales don't want this to crash entirely, so they will jump in at one point again and prices will stabilize.

Dude.. how is Bitconrekt missing? srsly :D .. and carlos matos!!
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:35:03
That's not true. Ask 50cent
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:14:02
Nope. If prices are low enough and the next bull run starts, new money will come and this crash will be forgotten. People are greedy, no one wants to miss the next surge, even if they lost money before.
Prices are not low enough yet tho, i think btc will go and stay for a while at 3-5k levels and accumulate.

I commented because it was on the top of my timeline stupid bastard. I don't spend all my time to help you naive idiot to understand what's going on. Considering that bitfinexed is a clever guy, he wouldn't do it either.. unless he is payed.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:17:46
They can't. Look at history. These kind of things ended always in a huge crisis.

Someone has to buy high and sell low. That's how others get their lambos :p

Most germans think bitcoin is a scam. They also don't trust stocks. Most germans are used to put their savings on the bank to get some interest rates, which were like 2-3%+ few years ago. Now it's 0.1% and you have to pay for your account + inflation.. bad deal .. they will have to rethink.

He is not a messenger. Don't believe anyone. No one would waste all of his time for this thing.. unless he is payed.. maybe even by Bitfinex. Spread Tether Fud, scare people out of tether and let them tank the crash, while whales and bitfinex keep using tether...
