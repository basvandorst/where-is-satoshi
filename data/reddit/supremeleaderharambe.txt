42 characters if I counted correctly, and bitstamp stopped 8 characters too early

yea it starts with bc1. How do I change the Format?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:31:36
The adress starts with bc1 and loooks like a normal adress (at least to my beginner eyes)

It is, question is for how long

Nobody ever said it isn't risky, that's why everyone suggest only investing what you can afford to loose. And you need to be prepared for every possibility, think about how it crashed right after the fork was cancelled... If you invest in Bitcoin you need to be ready for possibly losing everything.

But doesn't this article say that bitstamps supports bench32 addresses?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:08:52
Immedeately after the "crash", too

Really? I always thought it can't be used in germany because of this:

Segwit was cancelled, and a lot of people recently just sold all their altcoins for btc to profit from the fork. With the fork no longer happening they start to sell now. should I do so too and buy back in later?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:04:52
Same here, I bought a bit more but oviously I am kind of worried about investing more _now_. Then again thats what I also thought when I got in a month ago...

Forgive yourself man. Investing that early can very well lead to either selling when its at one of its earlier peaks (for example 300), or your wallet being hacked. A lot, if not most, of the very early investors lost money over bitcoin. Just stay positive. Also, in your current situation, I really wouldn't suggest going into BTC as you porpably cant afford to lose money. 
I hope that things work out for you :)

I wish I would have done the same... Reddit is a really bad place for actual crypto advice. Now I need to either take my gains or hope that it will go up significantly again... but what are the chances
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:11:08
ok I think I understood the basic concept. So if I understand this right, the last fork was BTC-BCH? With BCH being the new currency?
And now when I buy BTC, in a few weeks that will be split into BTC and BTG. But what am I supposed to do with BTG? Just wait for it to increase in value too, or, like you suggested, sell BTG and put all that money back in BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:12:16
So my BTC will be split into BTC and BTG, and the only logical thing to do would be sell all BTG immedeately and put it back in BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:04:52
Ok! Will the coin work like its own currency then or what exactly makes it different from BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:14:35
I know this is an old post, but I thought coinbase wasn't available in germany?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:04:30
Assuming I want to invest in BTC. Will it be enough to buy, say, 500€ worth of BTC on coinbase.com, and then wait? So that I can just sell them again once they are (hopefully) worth more money? Or do I have to consider more things, like fee etc.?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:18:17
Ok, and for dumping it I would just go to the merchant of my choice and sell it there, or is that done differently?
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:55:35
Thank you! However I still dont exactly understand what the fork is... if the forked coin will be a lot less, why should I buy now? What do you mean by forked version of my investment?
