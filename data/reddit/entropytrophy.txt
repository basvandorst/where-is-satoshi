Amen. But it’s more than this. People need to leave their comfortable social bubbles and break free from their biased sources of information - which is practically every news source. As long as news information is a for-profit industry, information will be produced with profits in mind which leads to hot takes to stir up controversy, clicks and thus money.

Whether it’s true or not is still unknown but it’s pretty clear why somebody may guess that. Look at the facts from the Epstein case and Clinton’s history.

BTC is still highly speculative. And I assume the average member of this sub is quite young. I assume the meme posting is done by kids with $100 bucks in BTC.
I feel it’s highly undervalued and have a position in bitcoin but I rarely if ever come to this sub because what is the point? It’s not like it changes much day-to-day in terms of fundamentals so in reality there isn’t much to talk about for most of us.

Speak for yourself, chump.

So far.. hopefully this continues.

If it was entirely effortless to switch from the dollar to bitcoin I would. And I speculate that in time it will be.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:21:49


Lol what. Ok this is the point that this conversation ends. You really have no idea what you’re talking about ��
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:18:47
I find it unethical to trick people. Or in other words, scam them. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:27:16


I agree. Twitter, as a business operating in the free markets, should shut down  on the basis that it’s a financial scam.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:09:30
Exactly. An exchange between two offline users via Bluetooth is not possible.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:18:00
If you’re on a local intranet with no communication to the global internet you have no means of communicating with the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:53:27
You have no idea how bitcoin works. You need to watch some bitcoin introduction videos on YouTube.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:37:14
Exactly my point though. If an area was cut off from the Internet, a mesh network can help people stay connected via chat apps. They would not, however, be able to use bitcoin.

From 10k it’ll go to 9k or 11k. I agree that it won’t remain 10k for eternity. Hell, even this whole universe won’t last. Let’s be real.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:40:03


I do understand this quite well. I also understand you dodged my question completely because you don’t have an actual answer. 
If you and I are offline but connected via Bluetooth, how do we exchange bitcoin?


@_date: 2019-09-03 15:25:46
Can you explain how? You and I are offline but connect to each other via Bluetooth. How do we exchange bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:56:32
I’ve never had Pizzahol before. It must be damn good if people are becoming Pizzaholics!
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:35:04
Sure. I'm talking about users disconnected from the internet spending bitcoin via only bluetooth. That's not possible.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:56:56
Yea that would be sweet.
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:42:01
Man I’d love to visit Italy for like 2 months with no agenda other than eating great food and drinking espresso.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:40:18
Are you nitpicking over my word choice or do you not understand momentum when it pertains to investments?
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:58:58
Dude I’m not going to waste my time educating you on networking, blockchain, etc. you need to do your own research. Based on this conversation, you’re missing the very basics.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:32:40
You’re correct. I am a holder so I don’t follow too closely but it seems right now is a tipping point for where it’s going in the next few months at least. We had a huge jump up followed by relative calm. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:47:32
I think through 10k. This bull run wants it so bad. And 10k is that psychological victory point. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:44:53
But.. if you have no internet access you could not exchange bitcoin. 
The chat app from the article uses Bluetooth. You cannot use bitcoin with only Bluetooth.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:11:29
I view it as an investment. I do think we will see a day when it can be easily used as a currency at which point I would use it that way. By then I believe it will be more valuable.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:07:20
I started buying again after staying away from the markets for over a year. These prices are amazing for accumulating.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:16:05
LN is why I have remained long-term bullish through all the bullshit. Instant near-zero fee transactions via bitcoin will change the game.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:10:43
Mods gonna want to delete this shit
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:08:37
Hell yes I am. Not missing these prices and regretting it later.
