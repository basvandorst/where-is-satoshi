Great App. I wish it was a little more feature rich, like disabling $1 in change. 
Adding fun stats would get me to open the app more often. Like a pie chart showing where my change came from (50% food, 30% services, 20% lodging). Maybe a bar chart showing me the different prices I purchased btc at. 
Other than my small wishlist, I think this program is fantastic. Its not as obtrusive as Acorns and makes me happy that im earning btc everyday without having to think about it.

There are a lot of people on who are defending Ross, not because of his actions, but because of the governments actions in capturing and prosecuting him.
Finding the server illegally, the fabrication of the murder charges, the federal investigators going corrupt, the railroading of evidence in the trial.
It doesn't mean Ross doesn't deserve to do time. It just means he was never given a fair trail to begin with.

You want a source? How about you read the document you posted for me to read.
You can't use Debit cards for Ecommerce transactions. A purchase can only be qualified as a debit if you use an encrypted Pin Pad. Otherwise it is classified as an unqualified debit transaction, and you are charged Credit rates.
So you are NEVER going to get the cheapest interchange rate for an Ecommerce transaction. Instead you are going to pay the Credit, Unqualified, Ecomm Fee. This is a lot more than a Debit Transaction that has been verified with a Pin.
Lets assume that you are using some magic Pin Pad, and you only have to pay $0.21 interchange. The company charging interchange doesn't provide credit card processing. You need a processing company to handle those transactions. You think processing companies work off charity? No, they have their own minimum fees that they tack ON TOP of interchange. This is standard credit card processing procedures.
Hence, there is no possible way to make an ecommerce transaction without paying at least a minimum of $0.30 - $0.35 in required fees, if not more.
How did you get money into Venmo? Did it just magically appear? There is a reason this is at the bottom of their deposit page. So sending money on Venmo IS NOT always free.
*To help cover processing costs, there is a 3% fee per payment for credit cards and non-major debit cards. 
Receiving money on Venmo is always free.*
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:16:41
Since you and others missed the point. The minimum interchange + processor fee is around $0.35.

Let me clarify.
First you have to download and install the program breadwallet
Then it gives you 12 words to write down, you write these down and put it in a safe.
Then you set a 4-10 digit pin, like your debit card.
Then you sleep without the fear of losing your coins.

It costs billions to keep our monetary system alive. The Federal Reserve will spend about $826.7 million this year alone creating currency. Ironically, this does not include electrical costs to run their machines.
* $1/$2 - 5.4 cents per note
* $5 - 10.1 cents per note
* $10 - 9.2 cents per note
* $20/$50 - 10.2 cents per note
* $100 - 13.1 cents per note
I think over the long run the cost of operating the bitcoin network would be less than our current monetary system.

Your credit card company doesn't assume the risk. The merchant services company assumes the risk, and in all of their contracts they pass that risk back onto the merchant.
These commercials are meant for small business owners, because they understand how they are getting raped by credit card companies. Obviously you don't run a business that accepts credit cards.
So many people don't even understand how the credit card industry works. If a card gets stolen and charged $1000, that money doesn't just magically disappear and is written off by Visa/MC. The merchant who got ripped off is paying, and thus they are losing twice.
Any merchant who is high risk should have a vested interest in bitcoin. For example the thousands of Bong companies that get shut down by their MSO every year, and have to switch to a "high risk" provider who ups their rates 3-4x the average.

It wouldnt let me delete the account until I send them the 14 docs again. I said screw em and just left it sitting there for over a year.

...and the reason is because they are using square. You can buy it off the shelf and start taking cards immediately. They most likely are lieing about their business type when they signed up on the automated system.
Show me your bank statement for the charge, and I bet the address associated with the charge isn't the same address of the dispensary.
You do not want to get busted selling marijuana, even in legal states. They will put any pending funds you have on hold for 10 months. This might not be a big deal if you are very high volume and can wait for the money.
It will only take 1 disgruntled customer to call visa/mc and file a charge back because "my weed sucked", and they will then have to play the ring around the processor game. My next guess would be intuit, then when they shut them down they will be stuck with smaller merchant service providers that will be okay with selling high risk items, but jack their credit card rates up to 8-10%. That's assuming Visa/MC doesn't have a complete block on marijuana sales like it does in every other non-legal state. I am 90% positive that their policies are the same throughout the country.

I cringe whenever I read an exchange added Credit Card support. How many people max out their cards, get the coin, and claim their identity was stolen. Free coins!
The last bitcoin exchange that did this said they had a special system to stop chargebacks. It was just asking a ton of personal verification questions. Who is to say that whoever stole your credit card also didn't steal your personal docs and can answer all of the questions?
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:06:33
You do realize the government has already fabricated documents? So you are saying they can fabricate the evidence of how they found the servers IP address, but they can't fabricate a simple email?
Remember they originally said they got the IP address from a leaky captcha? Then they said the IP address was in plain text in a configuration file? Then they said they found the myphpweb backend page that had the public IP in it?
Not a single security expert in the computer industry has said any of these methods are legit. On top of that the JUSTICE DEPARTMENT had the judge throw out the motion for defense to find out how they got the IP.
They claim there were email communications to an FBI agent relating to several "murder for hire" requests. They also claim bitcoin was wired to the FBI agent. Post the email's and post the Bitcoin address, and you have 100% proof that Ulrich is guilty of Murder for Hire. Yet, he is not being charged with this crimes at all.
You said, "i'm personally not donating a penny to this guy unless some sort of evidence comes out that shows the emails were completely fabricated". 
Do you realize how backwards this thinking is? If the evidence was fabricated, and they don't charge him with the crime, there is no way they would ever have to provide proof the emails exist. How do you prove something is fabricated when its fabricated and can't be presented as evidence, because it doesn't exist?
How do you prove Santa Clause isn't real if you can't find the guy to interrogate him?

Wrong. Satoshi posted the message in the P2P Foundation website on Mar 7, 2014. There was no key in that message. 
On Sep 8, 2014 the following message was posted on the P2P Foundation website under Satoshi's account, "On "Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet."
It is way more likely that the hacker got access to his email, used that to login to his P2P foundation account, and made those messages from 2014. Satoshi hadn't posted on that site in 5 years.

This type of analysis was already done to find Satoshi. The results came back that Nick Szabo was Satoshi.
However, how can anyone be 100% sure that Nick just didn't have very similar writing styles to Satoshi. Not to mention a lot of Nicks old published work is on blockchain technology. If Nick and Satoshi were the only people writing about that exact same type of technology, then of course it would match them as a the same person.
For example, if there are only two paleontologists working on a rare bone and they both publish an article about it. This type of analysis program may determine they are the same person. Not on writing style, but the matching of their unique content.
So really nobody knows if this way is accurate enough to warrant an accusation.

There is nothing "holding Bitcoin back". This is the natural evolution of a new disruptive technology. It's an ideological change that is only going to happen with a generational shift. 
In the 1950's they invented the general purpose credit card that could be used at multiple merchant locations. For the next 10 years only 20,000 of these cards were issued. You could have said, that generations attitude was holding credit cards back, but it just required more time. The next 10 years after 20,000 cards were issued, there were over 100 million credit cards in the US. 
New innovations, especially when tied into the financial system, are slow to start. We haven't even hit Bitcoin 1.0 yet, and we are still 5-10 years away from reaching mainstream adoption. People need to stop looking at bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme and stop blaming other people's attitudes for why they aren't super rich off their investments.
