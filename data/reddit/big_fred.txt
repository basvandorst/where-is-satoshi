This is basic economics. Deflationary currency inhibits growth, because it often makes it more economical to sit on a pile of cash and wait to buy something. Inflationary currency incentivizes spending and investment, which helps the overall economy.

I am not a Keynesian. This is not even a Keynesian viewpoint. Almost all modern economic models support a very mild inflation (only because achieving 0% inflation is basically impossible and small inflation is preferable to small deflation). If you disincentivize spending you decrease the velocity of money which in turn causes a decrease in economic activity. 
I cannot think of one reason why it would be preferable to have a deflationary currency. Can you?

Not so much cracking integer factorization as creating the hardware (if that is even the right term) to run the algorithm capable of doing so.
There is no real way to "crack" integer factorization with normal computers.

Just because a private entity has the right to put restrictions on free speech doesn't mean it's always right or just for that private entity to do so. You're essentially giving a "might makes right" argument

What is the intrinsic value of bitcoin over any other altcoin? Ultimately, bitcoin is just a *cryptocurrency* and a currency only has intrinsic value if people use it to exchange goods and services. There are factors that make some currency and cryptocurrencies better to use than others, but that isn't directly tied to the value of the currency

I think this is motivated by Venezuela as well

An investment that is ultimately motivated by bitcoin's potential use as a currency, not purely its use as a speculative asset

Right, but you probably buy things made by people who pay their taxes in USD, and you probably live in a  country that requires taxes to be paid in one way or another with the national currency
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:36:35
You can pay your taxes in the USD but not in bitcoin

Monetary in the sense that it creates a barrier for entry that stifles growth and competition. 
Let's say I'm a 19 year old with a knack for tech, familiar with bitcoin, and I have a great bitcoin business idea. If there were no application (and associated legal costs) I could dive straight into setting up a website, getting the word out, coding, etc. But with a fee like this, I would have to ask "can I come up with &gt;$5k just to have a chance of possibly making money"? For most 19 year olds or hobbyists, that represents too much money to go out on a whim and see how things go. 
Then, if my business could have improved millions of lives (and possibly brought in millions of tax revenue for the state), that wouldn't be realized because of the barrier. Of course, you could write a scenario like this for all barriers of entry, but in this case a &gt;$5k cost really is a decent amount of money for an individual or small group with an idea, which is how lots of great tech things get starting

I love bitcoin, but think of it this way:
The USD is currency. It is printed by a nation, used to pay taxes, and exchanged in stores.
Domain names are assets; they are something of intrinsic value (i.e. they have utility) that you own.
What is bitcoin? Cryptocurrencies are their own special class. They are kind of like assets, and kind of like standard currency. The best way to explain it is as a currency *with exceptions.* More bitcoin can't just be printed in the same way as fiat currencies because there is a cap on how much can exist. It's not run by a nation or centralized organization.
They also have utility, in that there is a (kind of) finite number of them that can exist, and they can be exchanged easily digitally. But that utility isn't intrinsic. I could make a cryptocurrency almost exactly like bitcoin and it would have the same properties.
I'm not saying that bitcoin has no value, because it pretty obviously does. But the "other people believe it has value" for bitcoin has pretty different reasoning than the same saying for USD, and I think that's what Krugman is getting at.

Let's be real though, there's no way they had someone in-house with enough technical expertise to debunk him or really even understand what's going on. Debunking him would require hiring some sort of bitcoin/cryptographic expert as a consultant, and even then how would they even be able to determine who is actually qualified to do the job? They don't have enough in-house technical expertise to do that either, and it would be pretty expensive to hire anybody good.
Only the Economist really even cares about Bitcoin and they never outright said "This is it, this is SN". 
In this case it would just be way too damn expensive and difficult for news agencies to really fact check this. There's not enough money in simply reporting on news in the world of bitcoin to justify sinking, what, tens of thousands of dollars (ok, maybe not that much) on fact-checking that they don't even know will be effective? You could argue that means they have no business on reporting this in the first place, but what do they really lose by having to go back on their reporting? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:16:36
Right, but everything there is almost irrelevant speculation. We just want to prove or disprove that CW is SN. That thread is about whether CW is partially assuming a dead man's identity. CW would still have to get access to keys, the bitcoin, etc. for him to do that. He could have not done that and theoretically still be Satoshi.
I would consider something like this to be much more damning and to represent real fact checking: 
The average person could not figure out something like this at all, and I don't think even experts could have figured this out with a "quick look".

@_date: 2016-05-03 23:47:35
Yes, but how do they know the "expert" is really an expert? That is, do they have a good way to determine how qualified the expert is to provide an opinion? 
They don't need some self-proclaimed expert being ignorant and wasting their time. They would want someone who is qualified enough to offer a legitimate opinion, and like I said, they don't even really know enough to determine that.
