I think it is important to have a lawyer advise you on this.  I can put you in contact with a very good Trademark Lawyer if you PM me.

Hi Guys,  Very cool idea.  I think the intersection of patent law and bitcoin is an important issue.  I would like to contribute content if that is something you think would be helpful.

But they **are** trademarking "bitcoin" for use in Barware.  It's really happening...

Cryptocurrencies are inventions just like any other technology.  If we aren't careful, companies like Visa and Mastercard will get patents on the technology and use them to retard the adoption of cryptocurrency in order to maintain their control on the world's monetary system.  
To mitigate this risk, we need a Bitcoin Patent Defensive Aggregator similar to Linux's Open Innovation Network in order to gather up cryptocurrency patents and license them freely to all those who agree not to use their own patents to sue members of the community.  
I am starting a Cryptocurrency Defensive Aggregator called The Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation.  If you would like to know more or get involved, please let me know.

Also, I am not sure bitcoins are against anything.  They are money.  Money is non-political.

Because the article was written to precisely counter the arguments you have made, and have been made a thousands times when ever the issue of patents and bitcoin comes up.  It is very frustrating to read "Eradicate patents from the society".  It's non-responsive to reality and is not practical. 
In the meantime, while you are advocating this patent-free world, your economy will be shaped around you by people who don't have your best interests at heart. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:32:43
This is absolutely factually incorrect.  You have inferred what "first-to-file" means based on the words in the phrase without actually researching anything about the legal concept.
Please research a concept before professing facts about it.  It only serves to spread ignorance. 
All valid patents must be patentable subject matter, novel, and unobvious regardless of whether a country has a first-to-file or a first-to-invent system.

If we just make our ideas public domain, we will have no weapons to fight back against the Monolith Transaction Corporations.  They will, and are, actively patenting technology which they will use to sue use out of existence because that is what profit driven corporations must do when their profit is challenged.
We must patent our ideas and use them as nuclear deterrents against these oppressive companies to make the cost our weigh the benefits of using patents to shut down our companies.
Get the patents,  license them freely to all those who play nice, make it VERY expensive to play dirty.  
While this is occurring, advocate all you want for what ever you want, but let's protect our community first.  We must be pragmatic. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:26:44
This is the right move.  Good job.

Bitcoin is an ecosystem and standard within which transactions occur.  Some aspects are software.  Some are not.
Important Bitcoin things that are not software: 
* ASIC Miners: 
* Wallets: 
* Point-of-Sale Systems:  
* Debit Cards: 
* Physical Bitcoins: 
* Satellites: 
At this point, I am resigning from this discussion.  I am not going to convince you that patents are good.  That's OK.  I think this Cryptocurrency defensive aggregator will function to make bitcoin a open technology environment for everyone regardless of our opinions about patents.   
The Linux community figured it out.  We need to follow their lead.

This is awesome. I am going to try and sell my car for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:01:19
It's only the word "bitcoin" and only used in conjunction with the sale of "Barware, namely, flasks, bottle openers, corkscrews; beverage glassware; housewares and accessories, namely, shot glasses, and decanters"
I don't believe there is any such grace period but some people may have ["Prior Use Rights"](  If you sell Bitcoin branded Barware, you should contact a competent trademark attorney.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:38:01
If you open source it, the guy who patents wins.  He will make it illegal for you to sell a product which infringes his patent and you have nothing to counter with.  It doesn't matter how many copies you make.
The better idea is patent it, give it out freely to everyone who chooses to not sue our community members so "everyone can benefit".  If someone does choose to sue us, then we sue them.  Mutually Assured Destruction.  
The end game looks the same as you advocacy (free information) but is a lot safer and a lot more practical.

This is really great news!

Doesn't matter.  Patent are international: 
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:34:37
But patents exist... and Visa is getting them.  They are going to sue the community and retard growth.  So... While you are campaigning against patents, let's get as many patents as we can and lock them up in a cage so they can't hurt anyone.  It's the intermediate step between the status quo and a world without patents.
Baby steps my friend.

Maybe you misunderstood the blog.  The Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation has a strict policy of not initiating patent litigation.  
All patents are used defensibly and only when our members have be first sued by a 3rd party.  
It is explicitly not preemptive.

but not for use in the sale of Barware like shot glasses.

Apple was very successful with its "rounded corners" design patent. ITC injunction and all of that...
Patent law is alive and well in the world. I too feel the allure of a "free society" but until we reach the "promised land", it seems we need practical solutions.

I am the author of the blog and have been thinking about this topic for a while.
I am starting a foundation called The Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation. Over the next few days I will be launching a website at  for the foundation which will provide additional details of my proposal. Please come take a look and provide you input. I think this kind of protective organization only works if it resonates with the community and people see that it is a value add to the community.
Moral Legitimacy and Solidarity with the cryptocurrency community will be out greatest weapons.
Any insight you might have about how to make this a success would be greatly appreciated. My email is Reed please reach out to me.

That is something I hear all the time but it is a naive and dangerously incorrect notion.
You can patent open source innovations as long as you are the legitimate inventor.  In the US, it's you constitutional right.
  
You can sue people for their violation of your patents, regardless of the open source status.
Examples: 
* 2004: Open Source Risk Management Group finds 283 patents covering the Linux kernel. 
* 2007: Microsoft claims Linux violates 235 of its patents:  
* 2007: IP innovation LLC sues Red Hat and Novell for their use of the Linux Kernel. 
* 2009: Microsoft sues TomTom for violation of the the FAT filesystem (a important underpinning of the Linux Kernel)  
* In order to protect Linux, the Open Innovation Network holds a patent pool and offer them royalty free "to any company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux operating system or certain Linux-related applications".   
We need to do the same think with cryptocurrency.
