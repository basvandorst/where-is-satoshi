What rules do you miss on an SPV wallet that you as a regular user need?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:46:16
And by doing so they fork themselves away while the miners continue to build on top of the block that was rejected by those nodes
If the node is not mining and has no economical importance (e.g. exchange) than nobody cares if it does not accept the block.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:40:54
As a regular users there is no point in checking the rules.
You trust the incentives which are built within the mining process and which is the only thing that keeps miners in check.
Your node will accept the chain with the most POW even if the miner did double spend. If the block is accepted by the network it will be accepted by your node.  
You could use SPV and have the same security.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:24:34
Agreed, there are some edge where running a node can have an advantage. You listed a good one.
My point is that regular users running them does not add value to the system in terms of validating and rejecting blocks.  
And that those users could swap them for SPV and would not be less secure (0-conf aside).
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:24:16
As a regular user you can use SPV and validate that your tx was included in a block.
All the other consensus rules will be validated by the miners and economic nodes. This is what makes sure that every miner plays by the rules.
A co-op of like minded individuals that are not a economic co-op has no influence on the network and is Mike running a full node as a regular user, pointless.

You are talking about two different forks. talks about the one that happened on August 1st.








He is not talking about SegWit but about the other coin mentioned above.








He is talking about network fees that user need to pay if they use BitPay or Coinbase to buy goods and services (outside of Coinbase or BitPay)






Exactly, bandwidth increased since 2009 when the 1MB limit was introduced. Since then larger blocks got safe.

* Bitcoin Core
* Bitcoin Cash
Both are clearly labeled.
I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2018-08-02 05:26:38
So maybe inform them that there are now multiple forks of Bitcoin.
BTC, BTG, BCH.
From what I know competition and choice can only benefit the consumers.  
A forced monopoly (by not showing people the alternatives) does not.

@_date: 2018-08-02 05:29:10
You could introduce native bech32 SegWit addresses in addition to the Cashaddr.
This would make 100% sure that no tx goes to the wrong address.
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:10:14
That would have helped with those transactions to the wrong address.
Unfortunately it wasn't done.

Bitcoin Unlimited has no hard coded value.
Every miner could fork at any moment.
But because they don't want that their block is not orphaned (meaning not accepted by the majority of the other minders) they will wait until the majority of the miners signals to be behind bigger blocks.
That is why there is no hard number. With 75% there is a good chance to get your block accepted. The miners could also be cautious and could wait until they get even more support.

I have to agree that the decision making process was not optimal. The community is working on this.
It doesn't mean though that the code is bad and that Roger Very and Johan Wu control Bitcoin Cash.
If you look at the last 1000 blocks bitcoin.com had 10.2% and AntPool had 10.2%.
Besides the fact that both are pools and don't control all of the miners they still only had 20.4%.
If you take the biggest block (others) than you would still need another 2 pools at least to get over 50% and even if you did because there is variance it is generally assumed that you need 75% to force a hard fork.

You mean if at some point a new version is introduced that is less strict on the previous rules?
But isn't that like saying that after SegWit activation we will create a new version that does not validate the witness anymore and now everyone can spend SegWit transactions?
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:53:09


I guess here we disagree.
If you only want to settle once a year than you need big centralised LN hubs. Otherwise you will need to refund your payment channels more often than once a year.
So you could either chose between centralized hubs or settle much more often and pay high fees. I don't like either option.

@_date: 2017-04-14 04:46:02
There is no direct 0 confirmation development. But if there is enough source in the blocks and you disallow RBF double spends then an unconfirmed transaction is reasonably safe.

Its a nice idea and interesting device.
But the fact that this is a electronic device without backup is a big issue for me.
I would not even accept it because of the risk that between accepting it and spending the BTC something could happen.
I think coins/papers with a temper proof hologram are the better means give someone bitcoins off-chain.

They don't need to have the same algorithm in order to have consensus.
Classic and BU for example are different but they are compatible within certain rules.

It was still a hard fork and done in much less time then we are already debating a block increase hard fork.


I do not agree. We have seen multiple hard forks in the past.


The minority chain will have a very hard time with only 25% of the hashing power and would most likely stop to exist very soon after the fork.
They could wait it out (finding a block every 40 minutes during 8 weeks at a great monetary loss) or change the rules. E.g. change difficulty or the PoW algorithm. The irony is that both changes would need a hard fork and would change the minority chain into an altcoin.
Meanwhile the 75% majority chain will readjust the difficulty after 2.5 weeks in which a block is found every 12.5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:25:58
If we expect all full nodes to upgrade why don't we implement SegWit as a hard fork?
We would not need 95% to activate and the implementation could be cleaner.
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:08:54
True but
 * 0 fees do not push the fee price up because any fee is bigger than 0 and would thus be included before the SPAM
 * 0 fee SPAM would most possibly get less priority then other 0 fee transaction because of the age of the used coins
 * SPAM that pays a fee that is accepted by the miners is not SPAM but a valid transaction
But in order for the above to be true the block needs more space then the average use.
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:49:33

I'm sorry. It is late here and I don't have the power to check you're calculation.
I will assume that it is correct.
If so and the total amount of money is reward + transaction fees and the reward goes down then fees (in btc) need to go up.
In this case it is absolutely vital to get allot more individual transactions into one block. Otherwise the fees would be astronomical high.
Unfortunately SegWit does not help enough because it only gives at most 70% more transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:47:07

Fair enough.
But of both are enforced by the miners and both could be spent if the rules ate changed than FlexTrans is not less safe than SegWit in regards how buffoons can be spent.

You can't fix that with any single project.
But we can mitigate it by having multiple developer teams with each their own repository and code.
If we stop looking at Core as the one and only implementation and start to use others equally. Like Classic, Unlimited, Bcoin, etc.
@_date: 2017-04-14 04:59:00
Old clients would allow you to spend them. That is why it is important that the miners enforce SegWit and disallow the spend.
But if you later would change the rules you could spend them because you do not need any private key to do so.
Today no miner can spend your coins because they don't have the private key.
But with SegWit a bitcoin transaction is not secured by mathematics but by enforcement of the miners.
Thus SegWit is not more secure than FlexTrans but the opposite.
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:06:20

If I know every word in a book does that mean that I'm now the best author and can write the next Novel?


I think they are wrong.
Regarding the best of the best: 


Do you know what you are talking about? How does SegWit give us 70% today? This is the best case and only if 100% of the transactions are SegWit transactions.
How can we get 4x transactions? Not even the Core developers claim this. They say 1.6 to 1.7 times the transactions.


i don't think it is contentious. It has been made contentious by Core. A year ago in the HK agreement everyone was ok with 2MB there was nothing contentious.
How about a contentious UASF. Is that ok?


FT has been developed by Bitcoin Classic. There is a nice comparison on their homepage and on bitcointalk.


If it was such a winner why has it not been activated with flying colors?
Even if ASICBOOST is the reason AntPool does not want SegWit. what about all the other pools? Why didn't they signal SegWit?
Maybe it is not the silver bullet and we need to look for other solutions.
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:38:50
The millions of user don't have much stake in the game. They can move to any other altcoin within minutes (some have already done that).
Miners on the other hand have a long term investment in bitcoin and thus have by design more power.
That doesn't mean user have 0 power but they need to by much more united than it is the case now.
Many users prefer other solutions than SegWit.
E.g. larger or extended blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:47:21
They might know the code best but they are not very good in basic economics.
How do you know that they know what is best for bitcoin? There are no studies proving that the SegWit/LN way is the best. Do you must take their word for it?
SegWit gives at best an increase of 70% while creating blocks up to 4MB in size. Sounds like a bad deal to me.
It sucks because it is a soft fork. FlexTrans gives you the same benefits without the technical depth as a hard fork.
The Core developers have fine great things. But when it cones to the scaling problem they just failed miserably.

The system should find a block on average every 10 minutes.
If 50% of the miners would stop to mine the others would only find a block on average every 20 minuets.
In order to fix this the system recalculates the difficulty every 2016 blocks which at 100% mining equals to 2 weeks.
With 50% of the miners this period would extend to 4 weeks.
After the adjustment the system would function again normally.
Edit: correct number for difficulty recalculation blocks.

Litecoin has no need for the LN. The blocks are found faster and there is more than enough free block space.
SegWit is implemented to fix malleability and Charlie Lee has written before that he would increase the block size if needed in the future.

Regular nodes could the set the max_block_size high or completely remove it.
An attacker could create a large block but it will cost him allot and will be orphaned quickly by the miners.
Miners need to coordinate. But I'm sure we could think of an algorithm that could show the miners what maximum size the others would accept. No miner will go out and create 32MB blocks if none of the others have signaled that they would accept it.

Please show me the monopoly claim. I think you are making this up.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:49:09
We also hard forked several times in the past without Abby issue or disruption.
The fear of a hard fork has no grounds. You could actually safely hard fork already with 75% whereas with a soft fork you should be nearer to 95% of miner support.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:38:50
I think you got it wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:54:04
SPAM is only a big issue because the blocks are full. This makes spamming free and increases the fees we nee to pay.
Making the blocks larger then the average use means that spammers would need to pay.
Why? Because SPAM would be included in the blocks. With full blocks SPAM is at the bottom of the mempool and is never included thus free.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:14:27
It looks ok to me. Why do you think it is shitty?

No, that's the title if a James Bond movie. :-)
I mean this:

Only that SegWit1x does not have an EDA and thus recovery will take months instead of hours.
This would be a slow but certain death.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:26:52
Almost everything is the same.  
The biggest difference is the desktop.
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:12:48






You must be an angry person to feel the need to use such harsh words.
Do you want to bet 1 ETH?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:11:49
Interesting times.  
We will see how adoption goes and if blocks are big enough.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:11:21


The problem with this is that should the 95% return the next 2016 blocks will be found within half a week and S1x would be back on the high difficulty it was at the time of the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:49:07
Because at that moment it becomes less profitable again and the miners will leave.
With the difficulty high it will take again months until it readjusts. And should it survive this long the pattern works repeat again.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:05:13


And betting equals an economic stake? Haven't heard that one yet.
What about mining?


Suit yourself. But as you are not ready to bet, by your standards you are not allowed to post about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:31:35
I'm not betting. At this point I don't know which chain will prevail. (although I would say SegWit2x has better chances)
I'm just pointing out that should SegWit1x only get the 5% as mentioned in a post further up or would not be able to recover.
Same his true for SegWit2x because it hasn't an EDA either.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:39:10
You are free to exchange any coin to Bitcoin SegWit1x the second you receive it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:19:59
So I can only say what I think if I'm betting?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:44:45
Ubuntu: Ubuntu with the Gnome desktop  
Ubuntu Mate: Ubuntu with the Mate desktop
Both are Ubuntu.
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:37:49
And if I had no money? Isn't that a kind of censorship if you do not allow the poor to speak up?
But ok, I'll bet you that if SegWit1x has only 5% of hash power it will either die or HF. (it would be dead if no block was found for a period of at least 10 hours)
Let's bet 10 BC H.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:19:30


They don't see it this way. We will see.


With 83% in the majority chain this is very unlikely.


Please do so. I'm still very interested to see how this will play out.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:53:00
Why November?
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:34:16
No, but I see the works different than you.
I don't see those great achievements at all.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:26:40
I'm sorry.
I can't write an easier formula.
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:40:54
Well, it is simple algebra.
What is your education background?
You can write it as x + y * 3
Where x and y are the same size e.g. 2MB:
2 + 2 * 3 = 8MB
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:50:53
There is not enough trust to activate SegWit first with the current code and later add code for a HF.
If Core had honored the Hong Kong agreement I would agree with you. But because the trust has been broken we need the new code.
It is not a technical question thus technical arguments have no weight in this decision.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:08:38
Maybe you can list those great achievements?
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:31:19
Because the agreement would need to lock in SegWit and a block size increase in parallel we will need new code even if we wait until November.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:11:28
There was no need for Core to be in this meeting.
They made their position clear in the last 2 years.
They have overplayed their hand and are not asked anymore.
They can get in line or fork away.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:48:59
block weight = x + x * 3
Where x is the size of the non witness data and x &lt;= 2MB.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:17:11
Why do you want to risk an UASF fork when 83% of the miners have agreed to activate SegWit for you?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:56:56
It's interesting how all cryptos currently crash together.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:41:02


If the code locks in both SegWit and the 2MB HF at the same time than neither of the two groups have to trust each other.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:12:23


It is not the bit but the locked in code (for SW and 2MB) that will run on the network.
It is harder to deploy a new version that nullifies the already locked in code than it is not to deploy it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:20:42
What you confused about?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:34:29
Nobody will implement this BIP.
It moves the HF to November 2018 and it changes the block ratio such that there is no block weight increase.
Although I like the idea of using a 1:2 non witness to witness ratio.
Maybe we should even go further and change it to a 1:1 ratio.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:16:38
It is non witness data * 4.
2 * 4 = 8
Of which 25% will be non witness and 75% witness data.
This is the witness data discount that has always been criticized.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:37:59
Yes, it is always 4x.
x * 3 is the witness data.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:01:29


Do you mean the quadratic hashing?
This will only be a problem if we get many more transactions and for that we would need a HF.
And there are other solutions that fix this issue and don't use a witness discount.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:44:12
There are multiple development teams out there. If they all work together this is very much possible.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:09:59
Mining at home is in most cases not with it.
You need to calculate your ROI in bitcoin and not in fiat currency.
E.g. 1 bitcoin is now USD 2300.
If you invest USD 2300 in mining then you need to earn at least 1 bitcoin (+ electricity cost) in order to break even.
Many people think that if they start mining today and make 0.5 bitcoin in a year when the exchange rate might be USD 5000 that they made good money.
Not realizing that I'd they just have bought 1 bitcoin they would have made twice as much.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:01:26
Haha, very funny.
I know that you understand it very well.
Looks like you are trolling.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:31:24
They want to activate SegWit soon, of it is before August is not known yet.
With 83% hashrate a HF is not dangerous.
A minority chain has no chance to get longer than the majority.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:19:42
I'm sorry, I don't see great achievements in the release notes.
Can you point me to some of them?
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:53:21
Of course. Mathematics. Now I have to laugh.
Keep on trolling.
This is my last comment on this thread.

With this agreement the UASF group has even lost BitFury and BTCC mining pools.
What UASF chain is there without miners?
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:11:48
It is a parody of the nChain blog post.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:19:38
How does running your own node protect you against a majority miner and company agreement?
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:41:43
Why are you enforcing SegWit by August? SegWit voting is until November.
Why is it now so important to activate SegWit well before that date?
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:54:45
This is not a good metric. Non mining nodes are subject to Sybil attacks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:34:01
It is how I wrote above, always been this way for SegWit. There is nothing new about it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:25:27
This only works if you have a big amount of bitcoins locked up. Otherwise you will have to settle and refill your payment channel too often. (Don't forget that you need to pay USD 100 for opening and again for closing the channel,  USD 200)
This is why the LN will lead to big centralized hubs where you can apply KYC and pressure to suppress payments to people or organizations like today with the Visa network.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:28:48


You have to close the channel too which will cost you another USD 100. This means it will cost you USD 200.
Why would you want to pay such a high fee?
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:56:52
Let's say you open a channel with 10 BTC to A
B and C have both a channel open to you but not to A.
B and C now each pay A 4 BTC (8 BTC in total) through you by routing.
This now means that the channel you have with A has only 2 BTC left. If you want to pay A more than 2 BTC you will need to close the channel and open a new one. (each action costing you transaction fees)
The question is now how much did you earn routing those 2 payments. Was it more than paying 2 tx fees? Probably not because if so than the LN would be more expensive than on-chain payments.
Now let's assume you are a bitcoin millionaire and open a channel with A by locking up 350 BTC. This would allow for 87 tx of 4 BTC each before you need to close and reopen the channel. Now the combined 87 routing fees might be more than the on-chain fees to close and open the channel.
This is why you need big hubs with lots of funding for routing to work which in turn will lead to centralisation by LN hubs (almost like banks today).
