Wait so if a lot of people buy bitcoin the price goes up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:18:14
Can you elaborate

I would say the best place is from the ledger site. Although I did get mine from Amazon and it was and is completely fine. It’s up to you and how concerned you are but safest bet would be their site but Amazon isn’t a bad choice either.

Amazon worked great for me.

Yes, I love gambling and used to go out and buy $100 in scratch offs a week or blow $500 at a casino back in high school. (I had a good job). I then got into the stock market and saw it as intelligent gambling based on research with much less risk than traditional gambling. The returns weren’t anything impressive but then I found cryptos and, shit I feel like I’m back at a casino but actually winning.
