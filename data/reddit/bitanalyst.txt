I don't see how they could possibly recover, especially with no insurance.  Their name is forever tarnished as well.

At least they have insurance.

It's like a bank keeping all of their money in the tellers drawer at the counter instead of keeping most of it in a vault.  A robber could walk right in with a gun and empty the tellers drawer.  Oh, and the had no insurance to cover theft.

Well Coinbase never issued the 1099 forms , so who is to blame here.
They also admit to turning over court ordered data to the IRS.

The IRS letters are literally landing in mailboxes en mass this week.  I'm surprised there aren't more posts about them.

This is a ridiculous assumption to make.  Maybe he is dollar cost averaging his investment in Bitcoin.  Whatever the reason it really doesn't matter, people set up automatic transactions on their bank accounts and credit cards all the time.

No one accepts credit card payments for BTC since they are so easily reversed.  People would just buy BTC on the credit card then cancel the transaction and get to keep the BTC since Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed.

This makes no sense, newbies can always buy a fractional coin anytime they want.  Telling people to buy something with a downward trend in price also makes no sense.

It looks like the only option is limit orders since you have to specify a price on the order.

Does anyone have an actual source for this news? The Coinfire article did not list any sources whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:07:52
I don't think the OP is saying not to trade it , just to be aware of the risks.
Right now this is a very illiquid security making it difficult to trade.  If you do enter a position it could be very difficult to close it out, especially for the price you may want.  
Long term investors may not care about any of these risks.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:01:59
Bank transfer or wire transfer.

Well if you traded at Coinbase the IRS has your transaction history.

Date won't be set until the SEC approves the filing.  Could still be years out but they seem to be making some progress.

With a stop limit order you have to specify both a stop price and a limit price.  When the price of the symbol reaches the stop price it becomes an executable limit order.  So for example you could set a  stop limit order with a stop price of $100, limit $90.  After crossing through $100 the limit order for $90 would become active.
Stop limit orders do not guarantee execution but they do give you control over the execution price.   The problem is if the market were to gap down from say $100 to $80 overnight then your limit order for $90 wouldn't execute.
 
With a stop order you would just set a stop price.  When the price crosses the stop price it becomes a working market order which would guarantee execution, but not price.
You don't have to be an insider to trade in the pre or post market sessions, you only need to have a broker that offers this service  (Most of the major brokerages do).  Although in illiquid symbols like GBTC there will be very little (if any) liquidity in the after hours trading sessions.
In reality neither of these order types are really going to help you much in illiquid trading situations.  Most exchanges are dropping support for stop orders because traders often get "stopped out" during rapid market movements so tread carefully.
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:05:06
Depends when you started dabbling.   If it was back in 2013 when BTC was under $100 then even 9 to 5rs got rich.

Plenty of places online accept it for purchases.  Brick and mortar adoption is scarce though.  As long as the IRS treats making a purchase using Bitcoin as a taxable event it's going to be hard to get any further adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:02:54
Don't wait for Coinbase to send you a tax form, chances are they won't.  They only send them out in extremely limited circumstances.  Report them on your own.  Also if you use crypto to purchase goods or services the IRS considers that a taxable event too.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:52:29
When do we start to worry?
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:05:45
I agree that it shouldn't be treated as property but for now that is the IRS status.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:28:11
It's already taxed though, the IRS treats it as property.

I have to disagree as well, sentiment towards Coinbase is overwhelmingly positive.  They've already jumped into this post and offered their assistance as well.

I think his point is that if a cyber attack were to actually occur they might try to cover it up to avoid mass panic.

It did not just effect the floor, the NYSE exchange was completely offline for most of the day.  NYSE Arca is a separate system that was not effected.
The floor is really nothing more than a TV studio with a few traders left.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:54:17
It effected the entire NYSE exchange, not just the NYSE floor.  All trading at the NYSE exchange was halted for a good portion of the day.  
The people on the floor of the NYSE are simply using computers that connect back to the matching engine located in New Jersey.  
NYSE Arca is a separate exchange and was not effected.  This is mostly because NYSE Arca used to be Archipelago , a separate company (before NYSE bought them) and the systems are still separate today.
Similarly, the options trading takes place on separate computer systems and was not effected by the issues today.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:49:44
The exchanges already have built in limit up/limit down circuit breakers for stocks.  There are also rules in place to halt the markets if the S&amp;P 500 drops too far within a day.
As far as the issue today, although NYSE was offline for quite a while, NYSE listed symbols continued to trade on other exchanges.  So basically NYSE being offline did not prevent any stocks from gaining/losing value today.
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:01:29
I agree, I'm not saying people will never understand it or embrace it but if you ask your friends or family or some random Joe on the street why they don't own or use Bitcoin they'll probably tell you they don't understand it.
Most people have heard of Bitcoin at this point but they don't know enough about it to know how to get or use it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:53:49
I think the current tax laws are a hinderance to usage in the US.  The fact that buying a cup of coffee triggers a taxable event that must be reported is a big issue IMO.

Why on earth did they pick today of all days to run this again?  Multiple providers are already having outages dealing with the damn leap second.

Currently they don't get anything.  Previously the bonus was $5 for both parties.  Coinbase changes it around from time to time.

The floor of the NYSE is basically just a TV studio now, it's just for show essentially.  All of the trading takes place in data centers in New Jersey.

COIN is still waiting on final approval from the SEC, Nasdaq isn't what's holding them up.
The reason BIT (GBTC) is already tradable is because they used a loophole rule that did not require them to have SEC approval.

Any decent CPA can help you address the notice and file the appropriate paperwork.   If you need legal advice you can go to a tax attorney.

But what good is moving your money out unless you feel that her viewpoints represent Schwab's view on Bitcoin?  Which is why you should contact the branch manager to get clarification.
You should also consider that you'll only end up moving your money to another bank where you will just encounter a similar person.

The problem is finding mining equipment that can actually earn enough to pay for its cost.  If you plug in the cost and hash rates for the equipment into the estimatator at Genesis block ( you'll see most are not expected to earn enough to pay for themselves.
Not to mention nearly all mining equipment is a preorder with no guarantees you'll receive it before it's worthless.

Coinbase is a good recommendation, I recent bought some bitcoins there and the process went very smoothly.  It took about 4 days or so to get my bitcoins.  After purchasing bitcoins, waiting 30 days, and completing the extra verification steps you can purchase bitcoins instantly via bank transfer.

Well, mining was fun while it lasted!
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:48:19
I'm not sure there are any viable options available right now.  ASICMiner is essentially the only place to buy instock miners that ship immediately but at current prices they're unlikely to make ROI.
According to the Genesis Block mining calculator many of the pre-orders won't make ROI either, and they are not guaranteed to ship on time.
Of course there is always the possibility that BTC could see a big jump in value some day but as many people are quick to point out if you beleive value will increase you should simply buy and hold.
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:50:19
