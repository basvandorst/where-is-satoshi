You should be a comedian bro. Never heard anything so witty.

MGTOW doesn't even necessarily preach celibacy, just no committed relationships or marriage.
You moron.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:52:09
Oh please no. I'll be crying myself to sleep tonight without your compassion :(
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:36:22
Why dont you go and fix the plumbing or something instead like a good house husband?
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:30:00
You are like a broken record. 
Amusing how I've been working out for 9 years and you're probably this chubby little balding cuck.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:31:29
Hahaha. I'm literally copying and pasting from your comment - 'Celibacy is the state of not being married'.
And now you're going to deny saying it? 
You are truly one dumb motherfucker.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:20:22
Haha you know absolutely nothing about me.
Go fuck yourself.
Do it.

Well good for you. 
However the young western girls these days are nothing like those of 25 years ago. 
They are now manlier than most young guys. And with a far worse attitude. In the UK at the very least...

Doesn't mean you'll enjoy it though.
I have never met a man older than 50 who is glad that he got married.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:07:24
It's already pretty great thanks. But you too.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:26:49
I never said that sentence though, you cretin. I said manlier than most young guys. Which is arguably a fact. 
I'm all about the self improvement thanks, which is why I don't want to throw away my awesome life for a fat 50 year old hog wife like you did.
I'm sure she's patting you on the head now. I pity you.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:38:19
That's because it's not a cause you idiot. We don't care.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:23:38
Celibacy is the state of not getting married?
Wow...  you're far stupider than I'd ever suspected possible.
@_date: 2019-01-05 12:19:57
It's kind folks like you who help me renew my faith in humanity.

Such original content everywhere on Reddit.
