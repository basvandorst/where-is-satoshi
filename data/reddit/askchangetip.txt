Hi there. We just looked into your withdrawals and found that they are still pending. Unfortunately some withdrawals are being delayed by long waits for blockchain confirmations. We're improving our fee calculations to help avoid further delays. Thank you for your patience!

Your profile doesn't show any record of recent tips. Maybe it was another account? You can email support if you prefer.

We are processing withdrawals around the clock. It is normal to see a zero balance while a withdrawal is pending, but our records show that your withdrawal a couple weeks ago was delivered. If you are referring to a different account, please PM us your username or your email address so we can review your support email and account. We have a backlog of email support requests, so we must not have seen it yet.

We were able to find the relevant account info that shows the transaction was sent very recently. Please let us know if you have any other questions. Take care!
