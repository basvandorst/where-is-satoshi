Well if I cash out into fiat then I have to pay taxes, for starters. And that's why I'm wondering if other types of crypto would be accepted, etc. I get paid in crypto and having a bank account is becoming an annoyance at this point.

Don't forget stupid references to bachelor parties and showing his *pay* around for a good time in Vegas. The OP and his coworkers and families wouldn't have much money to spend in Vegas due to his royal fuck-ups.  Hashtags were certainly out of place and referring to other customers "killing it" was actually rubbing salt in the wound.  Of course this is assuming that the OP is telling the truth.  
Would love to hear Robocoin's response to this.

I would think that, in general, unless you are the first one to one of these stories that it's highly unlikely you'll beat the whales to acting on the news. Heck they even have bots now that scrape the internet and look at the verbiage associated BTC and act in real-time (or nearly).  
Plus, since these aren't actual shares of a company the individuals at Coinbase can buy and sell Bitcoins without having to worry about insider trading laws.

You mention this sort of stuff as a side-thought but I've seen this exact thing happen to my younger brother. As a kid he was severely punished for just about anything so to survive he learned how to deny and avoid confrontation, and now he does it all the time as an adult.  
Exactly how someone like this comes in to positions of power is beyond me. Maybe he can handle the heat better and deflect it where others would have resigned or whatever.

"Totalitarian" is such a ridiculous hyperbole. Ultimately everyone involved with Bitcoin is free to move to other crypto's or fiat, using terms like "totalitarian" in this debate just undermines whatever argument is trying to be made.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:27:51
I think a lot of us feel, at this point, that both subs are echo chambers. The block size debate has gone on long enough and now the other cryptocurrencies are knocking on our door. A resolution to the debate needs to be found in a relatively quick manner.
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:16:12
That would be essentially as close to a free trade as you could pull off. Even so, there are laws about using BTC and whether it's supposed to be reported and just because you are breaking the rules doesn't necessarily mean it is a free market.

So there's a good chance this was just some transaction related to Shapeshift or one of Erik's businesses, right? Sweeping Shapeshift tx fees or something, I guess?
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:26:09
Yeah my guess is that it's one of his Shapeshift transactions which is not representative of most users' transactions, although to be fair it might be representative of what some large companies would experience.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:31:52


Wait, one transaction had $1876 in fees? I thought BTC amount sent in transaction didn't affect the fees. Was this transaction more complex than just send / receive?

I see your point, although I would on a Trezor someone would only need the device and could brute force the PIN (unless I am mistaken). Maybe the best balance of convenience and security is a hardware wallet for large amount, and smaller amounts on your phone. I'm assuming most people don't carry their hardware wallets around with them, right? And for the record I use both Airbitz and Trezor.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:34:52

Sounds like you know more about the details than I do. Just seemed like once China started putting on restrictions that it killed the momentum. As you pointed out though it may have just been coincidence... it'd be interesting to hear how (un)popular Bitcoin is in China at the moment.

@_date: 2017-05-12 05:37:25
Airbitz can recreate your wallet (if you lose it) simply by using your username and password. With Trezor you have to have a copy of your mnemonic key (which is more difficult to remember than a username and password). Flip-side is that Trezor supports 4 cryptos right now whereas Airbitz only supports 1 (BTC).  
Just my opinion, and I wouldn't be surprised if Airbitz adds support for additional cryptocurrencies in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:00:31

Our early assertions of Bitcoin hitting $10,000 may have seemed pie-in-the-sky 5 years ago but now it's looking more like we low-balled it.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:54:32
Yeah I just realized Trezor's mnemonic has 2048 words to choose from. For some reason I thought the word list was shorter (maybe confused the length of the mnemonic with the length of the word list?).

Total crypto is *definitely* in a bubble if you ask me. Things were tripling in a week or two... there wasn't enough development or actual adoption (use, not hodling) to justify the increase in prices. 
At least BTC'S increase was tempered.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:27:46
If you're only using Bitcoin, you should consider using Airbitz.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:50:37
Wouldn't that depend on the password used, compared to how big the list of possible words is for the mnemonic? I am asking genuinely because I want to know how the two compare. I know when I set up my Trezor there were only so many words in the list which made me concerned.  
Edit: Yikes, I am mistaken here. There are 2048 words on Trezor's word list so you are right that a mnemonic using that word list would likely have higher entropy than a password. A separate point, however, is that if you keep a copy of your mnemonic written down somewhere then someone can steal it. If you memorize a username and password it is unlikely to be physically stolen (because it can't), although the keylogger argument is a valid one.  
Anyway thank you for the discussion, guys.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:44:55
Meh, maybe I am mistaken but keyloggers aren't as common on phones (at least right now), and it's unlikely the keylogger would be able to log either the username or password since those are more or less entered only once and then cached.  
I guess for me, losing a private key or having it stolen for a hardware wallet is a bigger risk... just by my estimation.
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:11:57

"We"? This idea that we can collectivize everyone in the region of the US together as if they are homogeneous is at the core of the problem. Many of us don't approve of what the government does but they claim they take their actions with the consent of the governed... even though approval ratings are dismal and last time I checked only ~10% of the country actually felt that the government has the consent of the governed.  
I live in San Diego and don't have to really feel guilty for the shitty things the US government does because their actions are never my idea and I rarely agree with them. This "consent of the governed" crap is the illusion that keeps people in check for the time being.

If Joe so much as discusses Bitcoin every so often, his fans will absolutely start looking into it.

Ok, thank you for the heads up. I assume a bigger block takes longer to verify and hash, etc? And by saying "large miners generate more block on average", do you mean that they find new blocks faster? And by "larger" miners are you referring to the size of the pool or literally the size of the hardware being used?  
Sorry for all of the questions. I am not too familiar with the mining process.

You may be underestimating just how greedy law enforcement is. If they can seize funds without any repercussions they will at least seriously consider that option.
