I was just wondering why there hasn't been more traction .. I suppose there is in reality.  Implementation is a slow burner in fairness.
Thanks for the link

No, don't think it's unreasonable at all.  Just from a 'Utility Value' perspective .. it's waaaay undervalued (at the moment), imo
Hence my asking, others with more knowledge have shed some light on my query, so thanks all.  MortuusBestia's point, especially the "Clear evidence of Business to Business growth" is not going to happen overnight.  
I suppose when one reads about all the applications that are coming on stream that involved BTC, from Real Estate / Coloured Coins, legal applications, medical applications, integrating one's genome into the Blockchain etc ... you'd expect such an innovation to be worth more.  
And with the big names taking an interest, in my amateurish analysis, I thought the big names' investors might have shown just as much interest and bought in too, threby increasing the value of the Blockchain.
Alas no, 2015 is certainly shaping up to be an interesting year for the blockchain.

These dudes have disabled my account after my requesting a change of password - which was done last Monday - 5 days later and still have not heard anything from them.  I've recently deposited a lot of money with them too ... service ain't the best now ...

Speculative Sensationalism?  Don't know enough about the background myself, but just thought I'd post it out of interest for y'all .. but this section ... 
"After seizing Mr. Ulbricht’s computer, the F.B.I. spent several weeks analyzing data, determining that the laptop contained a digital wallet with 144,336 bitcoin, currently valued at more than $122 million, which the agency has attempted to freeze."
If such an amount was 'frozen', mightn't it bring another crash?  OR is such a thing even possible within the BTC chain?

Cool thanks for that... that article will come in handy for a BTC intro if needed. I did consider Seans Outpost, but can't find an email link on their site
EDIT: Just replied to one of his posts on here .. we'll see how it goes ..

Just listened to [this episode of LetsTalkBitcoin]( this morning and Eric is on here also discussing the same themes ... and makes a very good point around the 42min mark with regards to the 150Million transaction that was done recently - in that it was probably the first time in the history of financial transactions that such a large amount of funds was transferred with no fees incurred ... 
The whole episode is worth a listen actually to garner the flavour of both sides of the argument ..

I've checked out GYFT but seems to deal in USD?  It's all good and well holding onto your BTC, but a market isn't a market unless the currency is being used, so I'm trying to spend a little just to keep the market 'active' so to speak ..

Hi Jason...
I really appreciate your efforts for the homeless and the BTC communities and would like to try and replicate the same over here in Ireland.
But I was thinking of approaching one of our established charities and suggesting they start accepting bitcoin donations...
Would you have any advice as to how to go about this?  I realise there would be some education required as to the security etc ... and they would need some marketing chops to raise awareness, but is there (for example) any technical requirements I might miss out or gotchas?
many thanks
I'm just replying to this as I can't see an email link on your main site ...

A scaremongering, misinformed piece from an Irish newspaper ...
