There are other alternatives that would work just fine, have low or zero transaction fees and that are not controlled by a despotic government that let their own currency go into hyperinflation.

Right, I see what you mean. Personally I don't think backing is needed and in fact I mistrust it a bit, like Tether.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:34:05
The Bolivar would logically also be backed by its oil supply, it being the national currency. Even so, the 2017 inflation estimate is in the 4 digits and people are **weighing** the money to determine its worth. Why would their crypto be any better?

I suppose the majority of transfers for Bitcoin are in and out of exchanges to trade alt coins. The majority of alts can only be bought with BTC. And once it's in the exchange it's off-chain. From that point on, who cares about BTC transaction speed and fees.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:35:07
One can only hope.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:30:32
Yes, I'm sure that will be a big success. I'm sure the Venezuelans will be willing to trade in BTC for the fantastic equivalent that Maduro will give them. /s

It would add to the discussion if you would actually support this insight with data. As far as I know the bigger exchanges (like Bittrex) only let you buy/sell in BTC.

Wow man, what a story, and great to see that Bitcoin at least offers a way out. Thanks for sharing and hopefully things will get better soon.
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:02:51
Perhaps. But next time I'll have to sell I'm sure I will remember this story. I'll probably just mainly remember "Localbitcoins = bad".

Man, this sucks. Unacceptable response from them, ridiculous it takes this long. For me, good to know; never sold through them, guess I'll never will.
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:42:51
Fair enough. But it certainly motivates me to search for alternatives.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:38:52
Treating everyone the same sounds great to me. In that context I don't understand that you would tell someone who obviously went through a lot that nobody would care about their personal happiness, and more so if you wouldn't do so if it would concern something trivial like a new car.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:46:01
I do, that's why I felt your response was odd. On the one hand you sounded nasty, on the other hand you didn't.

Buy The Fucking Dip
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:48:32
Would you have responded the same way if someone would have written a story about how BTC allowed them to buy the house or car of their dreams?
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:18:29
Amazing story. This is what BTC is about: personal freedom. Glad to hear you're in a better place now! Stay strong.

Holy crap. 7 dollars. Yuck.
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:16:20
Sure you did, son

Where is the title based on? He does not say that. At least not in this video.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:49:08
Which is annoying because everyone should have learned the same stuff at the same time as you did?
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:13:41
You must be fun at parties.

It’s not going to be the sole cryptocurrency because it’s technically incapable of doing what is sometimes needed in certain situations. It’s processing speed makes it wholly incapable for micro transactions for example. It’s not 100% anonymous. And so on. I think it will be more like gold. Not so much used for daily transactions but fantastic for longer term value store. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:22:33
I understood that, but I have trouble believing you think this is overblown.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:51:05
Everything is relative... If I send dollars overseas the minimum fee is USD 100. Sure, don’t buy chewing gum with it at the corner but there are a lot of situations where that kind of fee would be fully acceptable. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:16:47
Based on what? Who would use it for illegal activities nowadays anyway? There are better alternatives. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:54:44
Wow. That’s just insane. I hope you’ll get this resolved eventually...
