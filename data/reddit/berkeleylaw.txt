Meaning ETH's share will go down? What gives?
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:29:48
I've got 5 grand. Tell me more
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:12:39
Thats what I want to know 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:13:25
Why the 28th?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:17:30
While it is true that today that was the case, generally it hasn't been like that. I will comment on this post again tomorrow and you will see that it will drop during Asian trading hours again
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:14:33
Yeah but predictability is boring
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:32:16
What did you pay for yours? I am looking at site right now where they are selling it sub 2k for a s9 and it just doesn't add up. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:57:03
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:23:53
How do you sell? What method do you use?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:09:25
 Just saying you can't buy anything with Gold and people still use it as a store of value
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:43:18
I could create a bitcoin lending app, would it be profitable? Probably for me. Would it look more like a stock market? Yeah. Either way I'm interested in this idea OP
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:57
On what exchange? Gdax is saying otherwise
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:07:49
What is their fee?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:54:04
People short currencies all the time- long them as well. Also, bitcoin is more than a currency, just an FYI.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:25:13
Who was the one keepong track of bitcoin in the pic?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:28:49
So much this
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:21:04
What do you think about storing on localbitcoin.com? Is it regulated and licensed?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:57:44
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:54
I have mine in another exchange, can you walk me through it? God bless.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:10:41
Please state source. Please. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:42:18
Short it then and then send me a message a month from now:)
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:45:47
It's adoption isn't what it is today, though you might argue that adoption hasn't taken place, the CME Future agreement is HUGE for taking bitcoin to the forefront. I say this: put your money where your mouth is and short it then and remind me in a month what happened. Didn't think so.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:40:59
This is just bad speculation. Everything is speculation but you are in for a surprise, especially considering that BTC has a limited supply and your LTC doesn't. HUGE difference.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:46:42
Short it then. Exactly:D
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:02:49
Make a run to a western country?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:14:00
How do I get my private key? I bought on localbitcoin.com and would like to know. I bought about 5 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:06:11
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:48:10
Short it then. Exactly!
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:00:40
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:14:17
Oh my!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:46:54
But localbitcoin doesn't have that option. Can I transfer it elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:08:55
Na, I'm in for more if anything baby. Alpha males on this side
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:37:47
There's always amtnxfreeride in the comment section fact checking everything.  Gotta love em
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:33:38
Send one to a new account on localbitcoin.com (meaning open one up). I don't believe in paying taxes for something the government had no part of. Don't want to share much details here but pm me and I'll walk you through it. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:25:30
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:13:37
I think that this platform will eventually take over coinbase
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:58:23
Got you. I have been having bitcoin in my wallet for almost a year and was just wondering about it. Do you know what are the trade limits on Bitfinex? What's the most you can sell?
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:12:19
I don't think they told him the proper meaning of decentralization 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:29:58
My question remains: when bitcoin increases in transaction volume, will the mempool be this clear (or somewhat clear, compared to Dec 2017 levels)? I understand Segwit will have a lot to do with the answer.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:25:10
I'm interested in testing your bot and potentially marketing it after redevelopment. Pm me.

So there's  a few individuals with  all these coins? I'm really not understanding
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:03:34
This guy is the nerd in school people want to be friends with 
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:08:49
I'm just seeing a lot of bcash trolls on this subreddit as of late
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:26:42
Communism aimed for transparency but could never achieve it. Bitcoin is an example of that and it gives the power to the people. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:05:06
It was seen as an asset when the price rapidly increased and people wanted in, though they don't know much about the blockchain tech behind it. Once people understand blockchain, it will increase exponentially once again
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:46:21
I have always thought that cryptocurrency is the only true form of Communism as communism in its purity has never existed. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:46:38
 Just link us the .mov file already
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:47:49
That is a ludicrous amount for very small equity. What makes your company worth $2 mil?
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:07:13
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:30:28
y'all swear y'all are experts
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:35:04
As long as that coinbase app is still relevant,  btrash will stay at the .01 btc level. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:43:22
He got mad!!! Triggered!!!
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:05:19
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:33:34
Amen. This is something that should be posted more. Blessings.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:01:47
Why would anyone give up US citizenship? You have no idea what you are talking about
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:02:08
Triggered much? I've lived in Norway and Sweden (longer in Sweden, though). Just came back from Sweden in October, actually. Our cultures are very different. American men are masculine, and proud. Let's just Scandinavian girls wear the pants in your neck of the woods.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:55:26
There is nothing free, anywhere. Someone always foots the bills. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:57:47
Take care effeminate boy ����
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:39:58
It really is awesome. The visa alone is wonderful
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:37:22
In one of the articles, it explained the lady was crying as she gave it up (she was living elsewhere and American taxes were killing her).
American citizenship is worth a lot, many people give up their lives on our southern border just to get a chance of living here (albeit illegally).
I'm guessing that you are a liberal that hates America or a foreigner that hates America.
