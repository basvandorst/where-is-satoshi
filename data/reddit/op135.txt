**no, this is the downfall of a unsound "currency".** christ, what the fuck do you expect to happen when you can't even hold in your hand what you own?

FDIC creates moral hazard because it gives people the impression that any bank is safe, and therefore people don't research their bank, they just go to the closest one without knowing how they operate. whereas if FDIC didn't exist, people would be more weary of keeping their money in any bank.

there is an infinite number of cryptos that can be created. there is only so much gold and silver in the earth's crust.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:13:44
because it was decided a long time ago that gold is already money.

there is no reason for any particular crypto to be more valuable than any other. unlike cryptos, precious metals have a finite amount in existence.

if that does happen humans will become wealthier as a result, because we value the properties of gold and it adds value to the human experience. we don't become wealthier as a society because of a certain arrangement of 1s and 0s that can be created on a whim. you may say i don't understand those laws, but i do understand what constitutes money, and cryptos aren't it. together as a whole, cryptos can be useful, but any crypto in particular is a speculative asset, however.

you're forgetting that it takes REAL resources to keep bitcoin and other cryptos running. why spend more on resources when you could be spending it on cryptos that cost less to get into?

why, according to you, is he unable to sell gold and also legitimately criticize bitcoin at the same time? 
you might want to check YOUR bias.

but goldmoney transfers gold, AND you have the choice to spend your gold as dollars. 
bitcoin you must exchange your bitcoins into dollars.

there are an infinite number of cryptos that can be created which dilutes the value of all existing cryptos. it's just like printing money out of thin air.

remember when "currencies" weren't speculation?

@_date: 2017-06-07 06:10:17
currencies are supposed to hold a stable value over time. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:16:25
i honestly don't believe you price things in bitcoin like you would with dollars or any other currency. more like you speculate that bitcoin will grow in value and can then sell it to a greater fool in the future before it drops in value again...or permanently. there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, the only reason bitcoin is so expensive is because people buy into the speculation, nothing more.
the "greater fool theory" in action, folks.

believe it or not, currencies didn't use to be a race to the bottom in order for governments to live beyond their means.
