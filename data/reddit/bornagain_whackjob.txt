I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. 
Is this still the easiest / most foolproof way of redeeming a private key? 
That seems to defeat the entire purpose of going to these lengths to ensure a safe, secure and anonymous wallet.

This is about where I stopped reading, can we get a tl;dr?

or the guy giving them out on halloween
@_date: 2012-12-12 21:28:01
yeah, exactly. it would suck to be a kid at that house on halloween.

I hope you have a paper backup of the blockchain, then.

Good to know! Again, I only had about fifteen minutes to play with this before work. I'll check when I get home.
@_date: 2011-11-04 15:39:57
Would you explain how this works, exactly?
@_date: 2011-11-03 15:06:37
I was being somewhat sarcastic. The point being, it doesn't matter if the gas station accepts bitcoins if my employer still pays me in USD: until the dollar is removed from my cashflow, I'd still be participating in the fiat currency system.

Evidently, yes - with the newer version of the client, I could only see "Synchronizing to network" last night and then a percentage as the block chain was downloaded. This morning it was "synchronized". 
Again this is the newest linux client, version 0.5.0 and I haven't had that much time to look into it. Is there a way to see the total number of blocks downloaded, as in 0.4.0 ??
@_date: 2011-11-03 14:23:19
Yeah, additionally it won't happen until my employer pays me in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2011-11-29 14:58:51
Interesting. I've always had transactions from them show up within a few hours. I guess I'll have to check after work and then do as you suggested. Thanks!

How could the value of Bitcoin *not* be pegged against the US dollar? Let's say that I paid for my haircut, my rent, my phone bill with btc. When those service providers need to pay their cut to Uncle Sam, do you really think they can do it with bitcoin?

I understand what you're trying to say, but that doesn't really apply to what I said.

Of 8 successful deposits using Bitinstant, 7 have come through within ~2 minutes of handing over my cash. I complete the Moneygram transaction and seconds later they show as "on their way" in the Bitspinner app on my phone.
The other time, though, it took about 30 minutes, so I feel your pain.
I don't get the hate for this service. Sure it's pricey, but I don't mind paying for a convenience.
EDIT: Are you sure you didn't screw something up during the process?
@_date: 2013-03-10 01:31:30
Sorry if that sounded dickish. Any chance the person handling the Moneygram transaction might have messed something up? 
Where I go, I give them a (fake) phone number so they can pull up my previously used (fake) information, which includes theZipzap receive code. More than once I have had to slowly explain to them that I needed a new account number to be entered. This seems to confuse some of the old-timers that work the machines.

Yeah, he needs to seed it like a guitar case, or a bum's Styrofoam cup...
...and after taking that thought to it's logical conclusion, I now envision a future where the homeless have QR codes tattooed on their foreheads, which I can scan via Glass from the comfort of my car to make a donation.
