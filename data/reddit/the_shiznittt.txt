I’ve been buying in increments. True if I put 10,000 all at once 6 months ago I’d be rich mofo, but I’m just a regular person and can’t afford to lose that much, plus the whole dollar cost averaging logic helps you if you get burned in market doesn’t work in your favor.
I started out with bitcoin and I’m going to hodl, I have yet to sell anything. If you truly believe in bitcoin and aren’t looking to get a quick buck you’ll hold for a while. A lot of people have regret for selling at the wrong time, bitcoin is still hot and rising so it doesn’t make sense to sell. 
But if you want to some riskier investments  try getting some ethereum and exchanging some of it for alt coins. Do some research before hand and understand the white paper and tech behind some of them and invest in the ones you believe in. 
I think a nice portfolio is 60%bitcoin 30%ethereum and 10%alt coin of choice

My ledger nano arrived, I opened the shipping box. And the ledger Nano completely missing, like it wasn’t even packed in the first place.
I dunno what’s going on with their quality control, their warehouse is probably swamped with all the new orders.
Don’t even try their customer service it’s a nightmare

Same I have 5 friends and couple cousins into it now, cause they heard about it from me. But I always come with the disclaimer of please dont put in more than you can afford to lose, and if this all goes crashing tomorrow this was your choice ok?
I kinda wish I didnt say anything cause whenever i see big fluctuations i almost get more worried for them than myself now. But so far it has been nice to see most of them make some money and be pleasantly surprised

Looks like you should have bought 2 hours ago instead

Same a lot of friends are waiting for it to fail so they can tell me they told me so, or rub it in my face. Lack of self awareness from most people.
