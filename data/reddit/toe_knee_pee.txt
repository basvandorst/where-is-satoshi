You...are not...alone.

I'm guessing those who bought in late and holds will get screwed over. Someone always gets the short end of the stick with things like this.

Gahh it sucks...but here's to hoping all the media attention will help to rally it up further. For what its worth, I recommend the Bitcoin price checker app. I just input the values I want to be alerted to, and it does the rest.

Hey there, I recommend the Bitcoin checker app. It checks the prices and alerts you to any values you input. Saves alot of headache.

Good look
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:11
Exactly. Not sure how I feel about all the media coverage. Its unsettling yet one of the main reasons it has skyrocketed.

A little too quickly if you ask me...hoping this isn't the beginning of the end. I bought in again at 17530 only to watch it drop to 16000 5 minutes later.

Don't forget to panic sell only to watch it gain overnight. Looking at you LTC.

Story of my life. Sold 1k of ltc at a loss of 3 ea to get in further for BTC at 17.5k. Btc stagnates and drops literally 10 min after and ltc goes up 40. Idk what tf I'm doing over here.

Hi there! It took me a minute but from what I understand, your implying the Chinese negatively impact BTC? How so?

I do believe he said 'a few', not 'a couple', my good sir.

What's that other 10% of you saying?
