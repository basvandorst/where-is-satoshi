I have a prepaid Mastercard card from Paypal I use for online purchases.  It is not tied into my bank account in any way, neither is the paypal account. This way I can make purchases without worrying about a website's security problem exposing my bank account. 
What do you need to get this card? $5, and various identification information for the Paypal account - no credit check or bank account info involved at all.  You can buy the card at numerous retail stores. You can get the same thing from multiple other credit card providers, including American Express. 
Not knocking Bitcoin, just pointing out that if you have money to put in bitcoin you can use that same money to get a prepaid credit card.  
Edit: I have used my card for every online purchase I have made in the last 2 years.  I've even used it for real world purchases a few times, on accident, since it acts as both a debit and credit card. I have never had a single instance where it was not accepted for a purchase.

I worked at a credit union years ago.  The funds on deposit were used to generate income by making loans and some minor "safe" investments. In the event they were low on funds they borrowed from another bank, if another bank was low on funds they loaned to them.  They were able to generate a very large profit on these transactions, enough so that the customers paid nothing for normal banking transactions and all of the bills were paid.  Most years they distributed profit to the members because they had more than their charter allowed them to keep in reserve.
I would assume that they are doing something similar to this.  But, they are having an AMA so someone should probably ask it there.

I can see myself getting sued very easily doing this.  I make my deposits on Tuesday for the Friday payroll. Even if I waited until Friday morning to make the deposit, the value could potentially drop between the time I paid them and the time they collected their payment. It could potentially drop dramatically. I can't see the labor board, or a judge, not supporting the employee in this case.

The way you have your instructions written shows you installing Vnstat and opening port 80 using ufw.  The next part has you installing ufw and opening a few ports.  I think you should reverse those if this is supposed to be a set of steps to follow.
Also, most Linux newbies aren't going to be very comfortable with vim.  I could be wrong, but I think nano is installed by default in 12.04 and 13.04.  It would probably be better for them to use that.

I'm not sure why anyone would use Paypal for large transaction.  They have a history of freezing accounts with little to no explanation and making it as hard as possible for people to get their funds back after they do.
I use Paypal for small online payments so I don't have to reveal my credit card info to merchants.  But I stopped using them for business transactions long ago after the first report of them freezing someone's funds for no good reason popped up.

If he is taking the entire 3% the processor charges out of your tip, you are being robbed and should contact a lawyer.  If he is simply taking 3% of your tip, as in 3¢ for every $1 of tip, then you are not being defrauded in any way.  
The credit card processor charges a certain percentage of every transaction. It doesn't matter if it was a tip or not, your company is going to have to pay it.  So if the customer left a $3 tip the processor is only going to pay them $2.91 and that is all your employer owes you.  It sucks, but the only way around that is to demand the customer tip in cash.

Ford competitor: General Motors clearly doesn't know what they are doing.  Their cars are running into our cars and causing all kinds of problems.  We think you should transfer ownership of their company to us because we can run it better.
Judge:  Sounds good to me.
I am absolutely amazed that the court was able to do this.

Be that as it may, it doesn't change the fact that they are a a known quantity.  If you were trying to sell a product marketed at Microsoft customers which would you rather have an "Official Microsoft Approved" label, or a "Official Obscure Company Approved" label?

It is an idiom.  If you aren't from the US, which is something I should have considered before making the statement, you probably are not familiar with it.  A better term would probably have been, "commercial software package that people are familiar with".

Ubuntu is a known quantity.  Anyone who spends any time reading technology news sites has seen the name at one point or another even if they aren't a Linux user. By licensing Ubuntu and the rights to use their trademark they get a little of that "known quantity" for their own product.

I was a systems administrator for a small bank back in the early 90s.  Part of my job was producing a report of various transactions and sending it to the IRS on a tape. It seemed like every month I had to rewrite the script that produced the report because new things had been added.  Unless something has changed I suspect that by now they are simply sending a report of everything about you and your account.

The London Police Department acts like it has authority over the entire Internet.  They have attempted to shutdown or take over numerous business without any due process in the courts.  Sure, I'd love to setup an Internet business there!

Stop pretending it isn't a real currency.  No one buys that arguement anymore. There are big differences between FIAT and BTC, but use case is no longer one of them.

You are correct, I was off by a year. Price 1/1/2017 was around $900 USD.  So, only a 2200% gain.
Groups who manipulate currency for profit eventually expect its value to rise.  When they stop investing in BTC there is a problem.  Until then, it is more of a valid investment today than it was in 2013 or 2017, so I'll continue buying until that changes.

I'm investing in something I believe will have value in the future. I believe it is a solid investment unless you are looking for day-trader returns.  I think anyone suggesting otherwise has an ulterior motive.

Every crypto rises and falls with the value of BTC.  All of them.  With the exception of Ethereum and XPR, everything else is is a scam. 
When it was $20K the pump hadn't even started. BTC is the hottest thing in old money investment right now. It is has become the default currency in places where Fiat has failed. Expect volatility and revel in it because chaos is a ladder.

Last time we had a bounce back we went from $375 on 1/1/2017 to $20,000 on 12/17/2017.  I'm totally fine waiting a few years for that to happen again.

I purchased on Thursday and initiated the transfer on Friday.  It finally processed last night after 32 hours. Yesterday, after hearing someone else say it was only Coinbase having the delays I bought $20 on Paxful and transferred to the same wallet.  The Paxful transfer arrived in about 15 minutes.  
First and only time I'll be using Coinbase.

That douche is the guy who took the $25K Fox gave him to promote a movie and blew it all taking food, water and supplies to the Philippines  after a huge typhoon struck.  In my opinion, he is about as far from being a douche as any YouTube celebrity can be.
