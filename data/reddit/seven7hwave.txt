We have an exciting guest lined up for this month's meetup.
Joey Krug (not pictured here; that's one of our beer-drinking meetup regulars) is the Core Developer at Augur - one of the most exciting projects currently in development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Augur is a decentralized predication market that seeks to leverage the wisdom of the crowd, giving users the power to buy and sell shares in the outcome of the event. If you remember InTrade, the centralized predication market that shut down several years ago, you're in the right ballpark. The key difference here is that Augur will exist on the blockchain, leveraging Ethereum's unique capabilities and taking advantage of everything decentralization has to offer.
Augur's innovations have received a lot of attention; the project even been selected as a finalist in the Singularity University and CNBC XCS Challenge. Joey will be joining us remotely from the Bay Area, discussing the latest and greatest about Augur, as well as answering your questions.
7:00-7:30: Grab a beer and settle in.
7:30-8:00: Intros and a brief discussion on Ethereum mining
8:00-8:45 (ish): Joey from Augur
8:45-whenever: Hang out and talk crypto

I wish we could fast-forward 6-12 months and see what's happening. This is a fascinating area that is set to explode with the advent of all the "Bitcoin 2.0" protocols - Ethereum, Mastercoin, Colored Coins, Bitshares, etc. It won't be long until it'll seem utterly ludicrous to trust a third party like Mt. Gox. IMO of all the emerging protocols, Ethereum's contract functionality seems like the best fit for decentralized exchanges.

Shoddy reporting here:
"The fact that Wilson and Taaki’s Backgrounds are shady have caused some people to express their concerns about the project. Taaki is allegedly said to have worked for DarkMarket, a proto-decentralized online exchange linked to Silk Road."
Far from allegedly working on DarkMarket (the wording sounds sensationalized and implies wrongdoing), Amir helped conceptualize and code it during a hackathon a few weeks ago. Furthermore, DarkMarket is not linked to Silk Road; it presents a possible exchange for all sorts of goods.

&lt;&lt;This level of transparency might be a bit too much though, because it could compromise the privacy of the company's customers.&gt;&gt;
That's true...privacy could be compromised for customers who had addresses that were readily tied to their identities. Any ideas on how those concerns might be allayed?
&lt;&lt; On a technical level, if the company used only hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets...&gt;&gt;
I was thinking any old wallet, as long as it was secure. What would be the advantages of an HD wallet in this context?
&lt;&lt;In some ways, this would be considerably more transparency than offered by companies traded on public stock exchanges.&gt;&gt;
Fuckin' A! I'll bet a lot of investors wouldn't mind that sort of transparency. Score another point for the disruptive power of BTC.

This would be a fun one to tackle, using a multivariate scenario planning type of approach. The steadily increasing difficulty is predictable and can be extrapolated with reasonable accuracy. The key factors for profitability: The price of Bitcoin and the price of hashing power.
There are already some calculators that take these factors into account, but it would be cool to analyze them from a big-picture standpoint. There are also black swans: what if unexpected advances in ASICs blew the hashing rate through the rough? What if the Bitcoin community - in an effort to further decentralize mining - began to collude to keep mining pools from a small percentage of the overall network - say, just 5% or 1%? How would mining be impacted by huge government and corporate actors entering the arena? Are we truly headed, as some think toward a mining world that's solely the domain of the Googles of the world?
Lots of interesting questions to analyze and ponder here...

The city is Hong Kong, where the album takes place - or more specifically, Kowloon Bay.
I've never done this before, but here's some insight into what exactly the music represents:
*No Passengers* - You're on a futuristic subway into HK. You're holding a hypo filled with nanobots. Yes, these nanobots will get you high. You are surrounded by sheep and drones who are mindlessly using their devices. Nano is your escape from the drudge and monotony.
Halfway through the track, when the 8-bit hits? That's when you inject the nano. Shit gets real crazy.
*Kowloon Bay* - You emerge from the subway station into Kowloon, teeming with life and insanity. Better yet? You're tripping balls. The nano is taking hold.
*Memory Subtract* - Your original memory will never be fully restored. Yes indeed. (Ghost In The Shell fans will dig this one).
That's the first three...

Vitalik's article pertains to m-of-n multi-sig transactions as a way to improve security, mitigate risk, and handle chargeback/escrow issues.

This is a valid argument, but there are big factors in favor of Bitcoin remaining the "reserve currency" of the crypto world:
- VC's are primarily supporting Bitcoin, rather than other currencies, as they build out a broader ecosystem.
- Wall Street will soon be getting onboard with the Bitcoin ETF.
- Retailers continue to adopt Bitcoin, as opposed to other currencies.
- New tools like Ethereum and Mastercoin are not mutually exclusive with Bitcoin; they can live aside BTC, with Bitcoin remaining the currency of choice while other tools are used for smart contracts and other transactions.
- Bitcoin itself will continue to improve and offer new features/benefits as its devs work toward a "Bitcoin 2.0" release.

I think it's likely that banks (and large corporations in general) will eventually co-opt blockchain technology for their own use.
One approach would be to use an internal blockchain, combined with [Triple Entry Accounting]( to paint a clearer picture to auditors of assets and liabilities.
On a more Bitcoin-specific note, I think some banks will be seek a competitive advantage through BTC-friendly practices. As the perceived risks of Bitcoin are diminished, banks will be more likely to offer guarantees that involvement with Coinbase, etc., won't lead to nastygrams and closed accounts.
The one potential fly in the ointment could be Federal regulations, harassment from three-letter agencies, etc. There will probably also be some variation at the state level. Banks in crypto-friendly states - for example, [CA]( where the state house passed a law declaring crypto to be legal tender - would face less regulatory risk in pursuing Bitcoin customers. The opposite might be the case in, say, NY, if they get all crazy-go-nuts with the financial regs.
Between VC's dropping millions on startups and Wall Street getting involved with ETF's, the perception of Bitcoin as the wild west will start to subside pretty quickly. On the same token, it's way too early for bankers to see crypto as a threat to their way of doing business. Larger banks, like Chase, might see an opportunity to gain exposure to this financial innovation with strategic investments in established startups, or even acquisitions.
On a more basic level, banks could also provide hybrid accounts where information about their account balances is combined with information from their blockchain. A nice time-saver, seeing everything in one unified view. A deeper integration would allow the customer to actually send and receive Bitcoin, right from the same screen where they manage their fiat accounts. This could be especially handy for businesses conducting a lot of trade in BTC.
Oh, and they could give out Bitcoin suckers at the drive-through.

Haha back in the day when triple digits were a mere mirage on the distant, uncertain horizon? Sounds like a long time ago now. Thanks again for the tip!
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:03:20
Those days are already starting to recede. Accountability and transparency were harder to come by in Bitcoin's first few years. But as money flows into startups and existing companies, reputable names will be established and this sort of thing will be less frequent.
Whereas before you might be forced to trust someone who, say, had a solid reputation based on their activity on the Bitcoin Forums, you'll now be able to choose from companies that are backed by millions in VC money.
The question does remain, though: with the scaling difficulty, is investing in mining technology a smart move, or a fool's errand?

I would leverage the public ledger to provide complete transparency over the source and movement of funds.
For example, let's say I have a Bitcoin business and in exchange for your investment, I've agreed to give you a 1% cut each month on all my revenue.
I could set up my business so that all income went to just one publicly-known address (or a small set of public addresses).
This could be easily tracked by investors. It could also be tested; investors could make a test purchase, for instance, and verify that those funds actually went from their address into one of the revenue addresses.
Agreeing to provide a percentage of net profits makes it trickier, since the investor is now put in a position where they have to trust that the company is spending money on actual business expenses, rather than skimming all the net profits for itself.
I'd probably start with the company outlining, in advance, all its fixed monthly expenses: server space, salaries, etc.
A company could then take advantage of Bitcoin's inherent transparency by confining all major business expenses to BTC, rather than dollars. Investors could verify that the stated expenses are indeed being transferred to the server provider (who also maintains a public address).
Stating expenses in advance means the company can't easily justify siphoning off funds. It also provides allows investors to more accurately vet the company; if you think the expenses are too high, you might steer clear.
Finally, I imagine over time there will be some network-of-trust type organization to provide a function similar to that which is currently provided by the SEC - an organization whose function is to take care of some of the due diligence.
One of the problems with most of the investments I've seen on Havelock and their ilk is that while companies provide a laundry list of numbers and data, there's no way to verify those numbers. In those cases you're better off going to Satoshi Dice.
One major credibility boost would be firms that manage to secure major outside funding - especially from VC firms. While this doesn't provide a guarantee that you won't get your ass handed to you, at least you'll know that the company has some degree of legitimacy.
On another credibility-related note, I'd be a lot more comfortable getting involved with a company that's owned or operated by a known entity in the Bitcoin Universe. Does this person have a good reputation? Are they well known in the Bitcoin community? To put it a different way, I'd feel a lot more comfortable investing with - say, Andreas Antonopoulos or Vitalik Buterin - than some random dude in Romania.
Finally, I'd want to see a company that clearly explains is business model. How does it plan on making money? Does it have a track record of making money in the past? How much of its profitability depends on a rising BTC/fiat exchange rate? How much would profits be impacted by high BTC volatility or a sustained downtrend in Bitcoin?
TL;DR: A company that could provide a VERIFIABLE monthly/quarterly/annual earnings report would make for a much more attractive investment.

The fundamental concepts here are that a.) one shouldn't be in a position where they have to trust a third party with their Bitcoin (or any other virtual monetary unit), and b.) while it's very easy to shut down a single service (a la Silk Road or Napster), it's impossible to shut down a decentralized P2P network (a lot BitTorrent).
Compelling stuff; you get the feeling that these sort of projects will help Bitcoin, Colored Coins, etc, reach a whole other level of usefulness.

I hear you. was a great place to be until about late-2013. Not sure what exactly happened, but the community turned from a positive, optimistic, welcoming place (for the most part) into a toxic environment that punishes minority opinions and is constantly negative. People like to blame the mods for this, but it goes much deeper than that; the most outspoken people tend to be, frankly, assholes. This applies to other forums and chat rooms as well.
Things are much, much better in the community that's based around a certain smart-contract focused blockchain. It's like the old days over there. Hopefully it stays that way.
This subreddit was incredibly welcoming back in 2012. My life probably would be very different if people hadn't been so cool and willing to answer a newb's questions. Those type of people are still around...it's just that they're in the minority.
There was a certain sense of optimism back in 2012-2013 - a "this is going to change the fucking world" vibe that permeated everything. These days I have a feeling that a.) a lot of people are underwater after buying BTC during the Gox bubble, and b.) hopes and dreams have given way to negativity, due in large part to the blocksize debate/civil war. But it's important to note that this switch to anger and toxicity preceded the blocksize debate by a good year or so.
It's ludicrous when you think about it. All of us in crypto - no matter which ecosystems or projects we're involved in - are part of something amazing. It's not every day a new world-changing technology emerges. For negativity and aggression to dominate the proceedings against this backdrop of amazing technological innovation is utterly insane.

@_date: 2013-11-07 05:12:26
Huh that's a good question.
Short answer: I believe it would be legal.
Insider trading laws generally deal with a company's employees buying or selling their own stock based on news that hasn't been released yet. But for BTC - a digital currency that doesn't currently fall under the SEC's insider trading purview - that doesn't currently apply AFAIK.
There's also the pseudonymous aspect of BTC being able to cloud what those eBay insiders are doing. So even if it were illegal, they'd find it much easier to get away with it. This same dynamic could come into play if/when Bitcoin-based stocks really take off.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:34:12
What you put forth there is IMO a very good perspective on the risks/rewards of Bitcoin. Definitely not single-minded bullishness, but something that you've reasoned through and calculated. Depending on your timeframe, the binary scenario is a great way to think about it. That's kind of the approach I'm taking myself.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:40:58
As I noted, it could also be symptomatic of single-minded blind bullishness. Thinking Bitcoin will move higher, in and of itself, is not dangerous to your mind or your wallet.

In a situation where Bitcoin replaces fiat, I think Gold and Silver skyrocket. The most likely scenario IMO is that fiat - rather than being "defeated" by Bitcoin, is inflated into nothingness by central government banks trying to inflate their way out of untenable debts.
Inflation is generally positive for gold/silver. So in this situation, where inflation is extreme and/or central banks are defaulting en masse, precious metals would skyrocket as a.) a store of value, and b.) a safe haven against weakening fiat currencies.
In the current climate, where things are more stable, Bitcoin offers an alternative to PM's - another way to insulate oneself against the risk of defaults, inflation, and tanking fiats. But in the shit-hits-the-fan scenario, both Bitcoin and PM's would probably soar.
What are your thoughts, OP?

Why's that? Let's assume you do the following:
- You use TAILS to load up bitaddress and brainwallet, guaranteeing there's no malware to steal your password.
- You turn off wireless after you load up the apps, guaranteeing no data is captured or returned to a remote server.
- You enter a strong password with a high amount of entropy - something above 128 bits: 
- You cross-check the BA/BW information to ensure that the resulting address/private keys are accurate.
This seems basically foolproof to me, as long as you remember your password.

The advantage to a brain wallet is that as long as you remember your password, you're always good to go. No worries about keeping copies of your paper wallet safe and secure - plus, a brain wallet is with you, wherever you go, as long as you can access the interwebs.
(Unless you happened to forget your brain that particular day.)

ZANG. That movie scared the ever-living shit out of me when I was young. Mechanical spiders with deadly poison syringes. Evening more frightening in hindsight when you consider Gene Simmons' acting.

Seriously though, congrats on your success. What was your path to success? Did you invest early? Start mining back in the day? Bought $200 BTC back in the day?
You might want to get a tax attorney and financial advisor; most people here have no idea what they're talking about.
One fact of interest (assuming you're not fully cashed out yet) is that it looks like the IRS should be issuing clear guidance on Bitcoin in the near future. This should clarify those capital gains issues.
While I'm not a millionaire (yet?), I'd definitely be thinking about wealth preservation and the threat of inflation eating away at your money. Perhaps protect yourself with TIPS bonds, gold, etc.
There are other people here and on the bitcoin forums that are in a similar situation. It shouldn't be hard to find them as they come out of the woodwork.

"There's an easy lesson to learn here: Don't store your Bitcoin on the internet."
QFT. But good god, Gizmodo is out of touch with all things Bitcoin. They have this unwarranted skepticism - a constant undertone of "let's pigeonhole this as magical internet money" - that isn't backed by the facts. It smacks of linkbait rather than well-reasoned opinion.
I'm no Bitcoin syncophant or to-the-moon fanboy. But Gizmodo is often guilty of just the opposite.
I guess we're expecting too much from the Gawker people.
For those seeking solid, balanced, fact-based coverage, check out The Verge and Ars Technica. Very good stuff on those sites.

Huh. Well, nice to see the government is doing its due diligence and taking some time to learn the facts - as opposed to, say, the kneejerk scheduling of MDMA back in the 80's or the fear-induced passage of the PATRIOT act after 9/11. No guarantee of a favorable outcome, but at least there's actual knowledge and information being passed back and forth.

Yeah, that's plausible too.
It's interesting that he didn't have all the trappings of a classic "drug kingpin." It seems he just cared about creating a free market for black market goods, and living/breathing the free-market philosophy he espoused. If he did order hits, maybe the sheer fear or power got to his head?
In the Forbes interview he expressed a willingness to martyr himself - die or go to jail for life, IIRC - for the cause of freedom. Now he's living that scenario. Maybe he knew, in the back of his head, this would eventually happen.
It's a weird mix of tragic and fascinating, eh?

Right - but the passphrase in my case is a string of random words and characters that doesn't occur in *any* database, anywhere; in terms of references something that's existed before, it's the exact opposite of the copying-a-known-popular-phrase example you provided.
Assuming you're using a random selection of words, mixed with various character types, mis-spellings, and foreign words, don't these entropy tools still provide an accurate reading of entropy and difficulty to crack?
Agreed that the watch strategy does not provide reliable protection; one can't assume that the hacker/program will gradually "build up" to the correct passphrase. However, it would provide a cost-free (well, maybe a few bitcents) advance warning if someone were employing that approach.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:51:06
Note that I said it's *starting* to turn into a household name. That's a slow process, but getting covered in the likes of Time and other large media outlets is arguably the beginning of that process.
Anecdotally, I've also noticed that when talking about Bitcoin IRL, more and more people have heard about it. This was not the case, say, six months ago.
I get the feeling that, given current trends, it'll be a year or two before Bitcoin truly is a household - or at least, very well-known name and concept. But your comment about spending time in a vacuum is absolutely spot-on.
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:03:53
I've done okay, especially last year when I posted the album on this subreddit. I suspect CoinDL might get more traffic as BTC gets more popular; there aren't any alternative sites AFAIK to support artists with BTC.

I love the origin story they give for SatoshiDice - something to do with Quantitative Easing, a lost cellphone, and spirits from beyond.

Out of curiosity I looked at my local CL today and some dude was selling for a 35% premium over market. You'd have to REALLY want some BTC to pay an extra 35%.

Slightly O/T, but it's part of the broader crypto/encryption ecosystem. It's also not hard to image possible use cases for Bitcoin - for example, a secure offsite wallet backup.

Maybe not their exact worth, but I'd say most people - at least here in the States - have a basic notion that a silver dollar is something of decent value.
Speaking of silver/goldbugs, I wonder how many are already seriously embracing BTC. Solid inflation hedge? Check. Lack of central agency controlling monetary policy? Check. Limited supply? Check. It has all the attributes the bugs typically like - with the exception of physical availability and fungibility in the event of societal meltdown/zombie apocalypse.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:42:56
Thank you for clarifying. Heh...every time I feel like I have a better grasp on crypto, I find that I've misunderstood something.
Incidentally, [this article]( does an awesome job of explaining ECC and why it's superior. The curve Bitcoin uses is secp256k1.
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:34:11
Nice...the beauty of this process is that it also eliminates the possibility that you'd wind up with an address or private key that bitaddress erroneously computed.

The tediousness of personal attacks against those who are even slightly bearish or sell their BTC (like the dude today who managed to pay for school with his investment) is exactly what led me to post this. I enjoy this sub but the negativity just gets tiring at times.

I can't help but think the alleged hits could be character assassination. Can't put it beyond the government to make shit up. It's so incongruous with DPR's oft-stated philosophy.
If he did try to order hits...well, that's just fucked up.
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:39:35
Let's say you've come up with a passphrase that has 200-220 bits of entropy, as calculated by one of the widely available tools...such as [this one.](
You are not using phrases ever uttered before, and are employing different character types, foreign languages, mis-spellings, etc.
This would make using a dictionary or wiki-based attack much less effective, while the high entropy would render brute-forcing impractical.
As I missing something here? How is this passphrase not very secure?
On a related note, one interesting defensive tactic I've heard of is to place a small amount of BTC in a "watch" passphrase that's somewhat shorter than your passphrase. So if your phrase is "goddamn that was an excitinng Basset hound," you'd place a watch on "goddamn that was an excitinng." If the watch BTC is nabbed, you find yourself a new passphrase.

I think Bitcoin is definitely headed higher over the long-term. Shorter-term it wouldn't be surprising to see a rollover from current levels, since we're hovering near resistance at the all-time highs. A breakout would be awesome.

Can you elaborate? It looks like the jury's still out for some bitcoin devs:

bitaddress is by all accounts and appearances legit. (Even if it wasn't, you're protecting yourself against remote server password theft by disconnecting first.) However, there's still a very slight possibility that the software itself could somehow spit out the wrong address/private key, which could be a very costly programming error.
To mitigate this threat, also load brainwallet.org, then crosscheck that your password is producing the same address/key on both. Unless both sites were using the exact same code, this would mean that your address/key has been calculated correctly.
The crypto-paranoid would rightly point out that even Mac's can be infected with Trojans. For a truly safe environment, download TAILS and boot from there. More on TAILS: 
EDIT: Ahh, you said paper wallet. The above applies to brain wallets - but you could probably use similar cross-checking techniques on the address/key generated by BA for your paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:00:00
Yup, good experiences overall. The site takes a small cut and the BTC winds up in my address within a few days after the sale. The owner is chill and responsive to any questions you might have...I'd say give it a shot!

It's important to note that Bitcoin actually uses another algorithm - SHA256. But a good read nonetheless,  if you're trying to get a better grip on the wily beast that is crypto.
