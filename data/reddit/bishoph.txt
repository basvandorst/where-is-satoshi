Some insights if you are just interested in the outcome of the analysis:
- Best day to buy seems to be Wednesday
- Best day to sell seems to be Sunday
- Best month to buy seems to be April/May
- Best time to sell seems to be around new year
- End of February respective beginning of March looks like a bull trap

Good that I'm currently playing with FB Prophet, a forecasting and prediction engine. I know of course that the past isn't a great indicator for the future but ... it can tell us something about typical indications. And the typical January fall or the steady rise beginning around May is only one "learning".
This is in no way a technical analysis, but gives some interesting insight nonetheless and at least you can learn something about Python and machine learning:
Have fun :)

Yup, this topic is very fascinating and the amount of data we can use is gigantic. The idea or thought beyond the analysis is that the demand and therefore the price is based on something. Attracting new users, FOMO, FUD, buying, selling ... the price of Bitcoin reacts. But how do people get the notion about Bitcoin, crazy investment returns, massive losses, spectacular new technologies and adaption? Talking to friends, FB posts, reddit or other news sources. I admit that the used data basis is not the best - but I wanted to start somewhere. I'll follow your updates and in your latest one you are talking about "negative publicity connected to news" - which makes so much sense and cements my claim quite a bit ;) Keep up your good work!

I thought about your attempt and within another analysis I had the change to incorporate it in. I came to the conclusion that the search you see on Google Trends is a result and not the driver. Here is my analysis and view:

Hi. I did an analysis based on FB Prophet to learn more about the tool and used the data from the link OP mentioned. At least in the € version are significant gaps (see  for details). Do anybody know why there are gaps in December and more important, where to get a version with complete trade data?
Thx in advance!

Hi. I'm playing around with FB Prophet (a forecasting engine for time data) and with Bitcoin historical trade data. Based on the past - I know this is not a good indicator for the future - we should see a visible drop in March. Maybe you find something useful in the forecast, or at least learn something about Python/machine learning ;). The code, links and the forecast is available on GitHub:

You are right, my analysis shows this very clearly:
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:42:14
Both. The last graph shows a huge news bubble around 2014 and a downtrend which we know was the collapse of Mt. Gox. Good news drives demand and therefor higher prices. Bad news drives users away and the price drops. Nothing spectacular, but I wanted to show that this correlation exists also for Bitcoin and that Google Trends follows the news and not the other way around. Currently the articles in the news pick up whatever appears to be interesting on a ticker and the articles are heavily biased based on the reporters position. There is no instance that works against fear and uncertainty or on the other hand does promotion. Sure, a decentralized and open community does not need "real" marketing ... but I think it would not hurt on the long run.

No, for me this is more about learning and practicing with the tool. I'm still working on this to optimize and enhance here and there. In the latest version I've incorporated holidays like Chinese New Year to see if there are visible effects. Maybe I make a post when I think that the outcome is interesting for a public audience...

With pleasure ... but in the next weeks I'm very involved into time consuming projects. Let's "meet" in a few weeks and see where we are and how we can collaborate and exchange :)

Interesting view, thanks for the link. Let's check back in one year and see what happened ;)
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:26:16
At least the past data tells us exactly that ;)
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:10:54
Between 12623 and 18115. Forecast is based on this analysis:

I uploaded the newest version with season and holiday effects and visible insights. Maybe I will submit a post later today as I find this extremely interesting and helpful and the document should be shared with a wide audience :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:44:16
Thanks for the note. Right now I have no meat on the table but this may change some day :)
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:41:00
As I need complete data without gaps and not necessarily *all* trade data for my analysis I've used this data  in the meantime. However, for future analysis and forecasts your answer is highly appreciated. Thx for sharing!
