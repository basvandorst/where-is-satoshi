I had no trouble with them. It took a week to get here, but I got my coins in good condition. I have heard with some bulk orders though some people had issues.

I'm not mad. I've known he was a dick for months and haven't trusted him since.

I think they only take the trifecta of Bit, Lite, and Doge, but I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:16:22
Except you can actually purchase things with it. It's hilarious how bitter you guys are towards doge! Lol
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:23:54
I bought 3 oz. of silver a few weeks ago with Dogecoin. We circlejerked ourselves so hard businesses started accepting it. I look forward to buying some precious metal with Bitcoin, but am holding out for a better price.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:58:49
Dogecoin is for fun, but I've also used it to buy silver among other things.
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:03:57
I get what you're trying to say but it really doesn't make sense. Cryptocurrencies aren't precious metals. Apples and oranges.

Ahh okay, thanks. I've registered with some tipbots before so I wasn't sure.
@_date: 2014-09-01 21:42:27
Uh, that's a Dr Pepper car.
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:24:45


This is the truth. Just look at Changetip. The Dogecoin spirit is real, no reason to downvote this dude.
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:02:10
Thanks for the tip! I have a changetip account with some bits in it. Is that all I need to tip or do I have to register with a bot?

While it could be said that [intellectual property lawas]( go back just a teensy weensy further back, no I'm not claiming that and don't put words into my mouth for the sake of your side of the argument. I'm make no innocence regarding piracy myself but I do have respect for content creators. The world is a smaller place now than there was then. It's a lot easier for me to steal your idea from across the globe than was even fathomable even 30 or 40 years go.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:38:07
Who had a lot of Bitcoin and gave away money? That's awesome!
@_date: 2014-08-07 03:27:26
Yeah no.
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:07:08
Welp I'll just see if it works sometime. I got the tip so it must work, thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:06:42
If you market it and take donations? Yes. And the love and fame if you do something special.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:58:23
Props to him, giving is good!
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:42:32


That could not be more incorrect, though I don't see why BTC couldn't add these features if the devs decided to.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:34:05
I even know some that accept it ;)
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:34:33
It must suck shaving with all that edge.
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:18:17
Whaaat thanks. I usually just lurk this sub since it seems like there's such a strong montra that I support in general but still question aspects of, I'll join discussion more :)
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:25:33


Not necessarily, for instance I am a small time musician myself. You can buy my album on iTunes, Stream it on Spotify, or watch/rip my music from Youtube, it's really your choice. For me this is a hobby, something on the side, all I want for is my work to be protected, to be credited to me.
I would not want for someone to, say, remix my song and claim it as their own, a principle which I see implied throughout this thread, though not in your comment.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:09:00


I answered your question loud and clear mate.
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:57:35
And what is the reward for progress if those ideas can be stolen by others? I'm a Bitcoin supporter but it's easy for a bunch of internet nerds to claim this, quite another for content creators.
@_date: 2015-05-17 22:16:12


Umm, yes obviously? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:58:38
:0 thanks for the bits I'll head over there.
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:57:27
That's a shame. Doge was one of the best things to happen to Bitcoin. Stop being a bunch of fascists mods.
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:44:23
I don't really know what you're trying to say, I think maybe you meant "hey what about Bitcoin", but I digress. Assuming that holders of Bitcoin want more people invested and the price of BTC to rise, I maintain my statement that Doge was one of the best things to happen to BTC. Also, Reddit is not the only place that crypto is discussed. The  IRC channel is very active and awesome to chat in.
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:54:04
The only reason I'm here is because of Dogecoin. It got a ton of new people interested in crypto. The only reason I hold any BTC is because of the mythical beast that is Dogecoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:59:43
(° ͜ʖ°) I can't, OP is to calm and collected (° ͜ʖ°)
