The lack of transparency tells me that it is probably not like this. My bet is that they had at least 2x the amount that was already lent in USD sitting there.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:28:47
They don't, but that's when everything is working normally. Negative balance on someone's account occurs only when the trade goes the other way and he has to buy at a lower price and cover their position.
This time the users didn't actually have to buy back anything. So you either remove any obligation from all parties or you don't and you get to take the other side of the trade for both of them. This way they just stole money, that would go into the market.

The first coinshuffle was done in NXT. That's a good use case for an altcoin. They put it in their protocol and now the Bitcoin wallet developers can take their feature and put it in their wallet!
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:48:53
Ok. How the heck did they settle all these positions? When you start start selling because you are closing long positions the price would normally go down. How far down? Who gets to get the lowest bid? There are so many factors, I don't understand what you don't understand in terms of them making money by creating fictional orders etc

Hey man, can you please show us the payment you did to the core devs asking them to build this feature for you?
I'd love to see segwit in the GUI. I run a full node using core, but I rarely do txs using that node. The reality is most of my txs are done via a hardware wallet.
I'd love to see more scaling solutions and not just a feature that would save users some fees temporarily. Still most wallets don't have payment channels, time locks, rbf and segwit, when core has already build all that shit more than a year ago. I am really struggling not to curse from the BS I just read.
Anyways, the devs build this feature that took many months, and until a few months ago they didn't even know if it going to be accepted. They did their best, and the got was bullshit for 8 months. 
So you want Core to write code to scale, you want em to fix all the bugs so that our chain doesn't get rekt and you want them to add something in the GUI (something they are already doing), while you are trading making a shit ton of money, yet they are all doing this for free.
As if Core has to do all the things you want. They do as much as they can, on the time they have. If all the Bitcoin rich people invested in getting new devs in the space, not for profit, but for actually making their coins more valuable, it would be great.
What a pathetic sucker. Check yourself man. Honestly
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:44:52
Nobody? Seriously? They just stay private. They have licenses and everything. Not being in the centre of attention is a different thing.
They have a license in Bulgaria and have bank accounts with Mayzus in 2 countries. Doing business with Moneypolo, Okpay etc, would definitely require them to have some sort of verification. It is impossible to stay anonymous in this business for 5 years. Some people know them and the authorities definitely know who they are.
@_date: 2017-02-01 10:52:52
Well at the moment we don't have that, but we will. I updated my post to include these as well. Bitcoin is scaling and will scale, and before a hardfork a ton of this should happen.
Also people do just magically pay more and more fees for as long as they can afford it and are willing to do it. Some times high fees will discourage some people from using Bitcoin, so fees won't rise forever and ever.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:41:54
Difficult? No. Expensive? Yes. They have many ways to get in. You can also use okchanger to get BTC-e USD. The fees they charge are significant though...

@_date: 2017-03-29 11:14:34
I feel the same. I just don't want anyone to fork off... I'd rather have status quo than split. 
UASF should be thoroughly tested and given enough time. August isn't enough time imho. A UASF should take place after Nov 15th. Give miners, users and businesses enough time to upgrade to Segwit. If SW signalling is above 50% then we should consider it, otherwise the risk of splitting isn't worth it.
UASF and PoW change should be there, but kept as weapons to keep the miners in check, not weapons to force miners to do something.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:08:26
Thanks for the correction.
So what are the risks of a split? There must be a reason why Core didn't propose it straight away. Last time we had way fewer people in Bitcoin. We are talking about 3-4 years ago...

@_date: 2017-03-14 18:30:03
So? What is the point of telling the world about it? Most people already know BU is crap. People exposing BU bugs from now on, should be considered anti-Bitcoin. I know this might sound crazy and harsh, but this is how I view things. Let them fork and die. They know they can't fork and I just want them to add more and more commits, so that when they fork, their stupid chain definitely dies. Exposing their bugs is no good, as they might be able to fix them, which gives them higher chances to survive.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:49:58
It's very existence is malicious, users will have issues. And most of all, users have no say in BU, as miners fully control the chain. If you think, Gavin, Hearn, Ver, Bitmain and most BU shills, want Bitcoin to succeed, you really need to open your eyes. If there was a fork, that would have ever had a chance of me supporting it would have been B Classic. BU is total and utter crap.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:39:59
For a few hours yesterday, there were many missed blocks. In 2.5 hours there were less than 4 blocks which is a lot less than expected. There was an already high volume of transactions send at the time and that created a huge rise in the size of the mem pool.
There were more transactions due to the increase in price which broke the 720$ and then a spam attack started peaking (most people claim that the spam attack was on-going before, but I mainly blame the missed blocks, regardless of people actually spamming the network).
Also many people were not using appropriate fees and they don't know how to use RBF. As a result, they might have send another transaction with a higher fees, without being able to drop the previous one.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:31:39
But Bitcoin Classic will. LOL. I said for the time being and I didn't say that they help bitcoin scale. 
Thanks for mentioning that. I knew people were going to be predisposed, but I didn't wanna change the structure.

I've been made whole in the past and I didn't expect it to be honest. However, I don't know how many hits can they take. There aren't many good exchanges at the moment, that could satisfy all customers.
BTCC and Kraken are the only ones I could possibly trust. BTC-e and Bitstamp follow.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:20:19
Bitcoin wasn't made for people to spent 3.7$ for a cup of coffee. It was initially, but its design is for completely different things. Sorry man, but if you think Bitcoin was made for people to save on fees, you are a moron...
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:15:10
Because, without a block size limit, the nodes wouldn't be able to validate these blocks and therefore the miners would be able to do however they like. They could enforce whatever rules they like.
The guy on the whalepool explained very well. Nodes, are active as a check on the behaviour of miners. If they can validate these blocks, Bitcoin can't function. And without a blocksize limit, limitless Poison or massive blocks could be produced.
@_date: 2016-11-30 16:45:26
Cool story bro. When you understand how Bitcoin works and that nodes (users) need to be able to download the blockchain on a timely manner, then come and write something again.

I pointed it out retard. Storing wealth without anyone being able to confescate it. I didn't mention transactions. I mentioned apps and businesses. It wasn't designed for that. It clearly wasn't. Decentralization is extremely inefficient. Bitcoin is nowhere near paypal. WE HAVE P2P (NOTICE NOT BUSINESS TO PEER), GLOBAL, IMMUTABLE, CENSORSHIP RESISTANT TRANSACTIONS. THESE CAN'T BE CHEAP (for now)! 
Do business need cheaper fees? Yes, but they don't need to destroy bitcoin for that. I don't give a damn if shapeshift stays on business. Bitcoin is saving my fucking lifesavings in this shitty country I live. Most people all over the world are struggling and that's why satoshi created Bitcoin. So that people can transact when others tell them they can't. If a business can use paypal I DON'T FREAKING CARE ABOUT THAT BUSINESS. USE PAYPAL. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT AND SO DO THEY!

What kind of survival are you talking about? It has touched the bottom man...
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:30:36
I think I got it. But if controlling 6% gives you so much power over Bitcoin, then that could eventually become very problematic. Trying to maintain a 10% control, would be way more costly, that controlling 5%.
The other problem is that if people don't fail, they will never learn. I understand that core tries to be safe, but there will always be a small percentage trying to harm the network.
From Ethereum, we learned that about 10% went with Classic. They don't want to hard fork on their own, because they will fail. The implementation is just an excuse. That's why they want to have most of the network with them.
I understand that 95% is a good limit, but it might not be optimal. These people are determined to hard fork. They will do it one way or another. And I am pretty sure they might even turn to attack Bitcoin with their hashing power, right after they fail. Temporarily it would create chaos, shorters would profit massively and users would be scared.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:32:16
I really need to educate myself on segwit at the moment, so i can't say anything on that matter.
At the moment, the adoption rate isn't high enough to justify an increase in the blocksize. If the blocksize was raised today to 2MB, that space would be free for spammers and it would be used to 'bloat the chain'. Not Ethereum style, but it wouldn't be helpful to anyone. And again, not all of the curret transactions are meaningful. I admittedly, make a few useless txs every now and then, because I like tipping miners and playing around with coinjoin, rbf, shapeshift etc. I might be considered a mini-spammer, cause there is no reason for me to do this stuff.
How is a 0.1-0.2 unnecessary? I would be against a block that is 3.7MB, just because it uses Segwit without being able to fit more transactions in it than a 5-6MB block in the near future. That has been my understanding. That eventually, more transactions will fit in a block (on average), than they normally could. At the same time segwit does many other cool things that I understand, but if we are going to lose on the blockchain size and bandwidth, fuck that...
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:59:19
Removed the link. Thanks
@_date: 2016-11-29 22:42:38
Wtf man. You really are confused. It removes some unnecessary parts of the tx and thus it fits more transaction in the same space. On testnet it recently even mined a 1MB sized block, which was equivalent to 3.7MB (with a lot more txs in it).
Enabling scripting, reducing signing times, increasing capacity with consuming bandwidth or space like a blocksize increase and fixes tx malleability. How isn't that good?
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:10:40
Solutions :
1. Pay high fee. Use a wallet with dynamic fees. (Core, electrum)
2. Child pays for parent (feature of Bitcoin where the next transaction can pay the fee for the next one to unstuck it)
3. Replace by fee (replaces transaction with lower fee, with a transaction with higher fee)
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:16:56

Well, proving vulnurabilities and causing a natural allowable bloat, isn't exactly an attack. DDoS is indeed, but the rest are simple exploits, that confirm that Bitcoin should never run on that implementation.

I think we are above 5k nodes, but below 5.5k. coin.dance , coincap.io and  seem to indicate something between those numbers.
Only by running your node over the Tor network, but then someone could potentially find that out. Not your ISP, but a hacker/gov.
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:40:41
LOL. Once again : For nodes to work, there must be scarce block size, by limiting the size of the block. Otherwise, nodes can't function. They would require unlimited speeds, disk space, processing power and bandwidth to work under unlimited blocksize. You really can't accept that without block size limit bitcoin can't work. If you wanna play with the words as of : Bitcoin can't work without block size limit, isn't the same as Bitcoin block size scarcity is what makes Bitcoin work, then I am fine. I am all in for Autistic people in Bitcoin (no pun intended and I don't have anything against autistic people)
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:02:37
Required more resources of all sorts, so the cost of running a node goes up, while you aren't getting a return for running one.

@_date: 2016-12-04 10:40:30
There is a difference. A tx spam attack is paying the miners, who can use that money to run more nodes. These attacks are feeding Bitcoin and users that are in a rush can always pay a higher fee and get their txs confirmed. But if all nodes are down, the network becomes unusable and people can't even agree on the state of the network.
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:56:29
I explained why this logic is wrong I think both in my post and comments. Bitcoin has become more popular, yet there are less nodes / not increasing in numbers. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:46:36
I thought I was clear on what I am afraid of. A big attack on the network that could take most if not all nodes down.
Bitcoin has been going up for a while, but I don't see an increase in the number of nodes. To me, about 15% of the nodes to me are currently useless (XT, Classic, BU, Core below 0.12 and some other implementations). The number of nodes has been static even if there are many more users and that is a problem.

That's not a big perk. It isn't even a perk. I mentioned it many times before : p2p, global, immutable, censorship resistant, nearly instantanious transactions are bitcoin biggest perk and they can't be cheap.

1. What is the right blocksize? Any arbitrary number will be problematic.
2.  Just posted that. Looks like people really don't understand the importance of node operators. Making it heavier and heavier for them, is a massive burden to the network.
3. There will always be people that will oppose the HF. 20-30-40%? That split would destroy Bitcoin. You think the core devs are stupid by setting the activation limit at 95%? Isn't what satoshi said clear enough for you? 'Bitcoin being hard to change is a feature, not a bug'.
4. 0.2$ fees aren't helping Bitcoin grow?  It might be long and it might be the response on Oliver's nonsense, but I make a case (only a small case) on why high fees are important.

I was talking about the scale of the attack. 1 TBPS! That was huge. I made it clear : it is going to be harder to attack Bitcoin that DynDNS. But that was only one attack and there are many many botnets out there...
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:12:15
I explained that it can be maintained for long. I guess you read my post if you quoted me, but you didn't get the gist : A. our opponents have way more money than we do B. They can make money from the attack, so it can be long. If they open a short and the price keeps going down, a 50% drop could make the rich and that would keep going.
Even if they stop after a few hours, the damage in the reputation of Bitcoin will be huge and I don't know how are people going to react. Old users might be ok with it, but new users are going to be skeptical and it might harm adoption.
I am talking about nodes that might eventually be useless or have bad intentions behind them. So I am not really counting them in the security. The are still there and are helpful, but at that point they might be useless. i.e after the segwit upgrade (if it ever happens)

There are quite a few people running a couple of nodes and there are certainly companies like BTCC that run 100s. What really strikes me, is that if some people/companies run more than 2-10, then there aren't many operators and that is a problem.
If the security/quality of the nodes is identical, someone could easily hack them and turn them into malicious nodes or even delete the blockchain from that nodes and make the node useless. That's why I also think everyone should backup their stored blockchain frequently, which means more storage costs. I know it might sound crazy, but hackers could easily access a node and destroy the disk. That node would have to download the entire chain again which would take days...

To me, 1,2,3,4 MB without being able to 'squeze' the contents of each block, are meaning less. Spammers will be able to feel the free space very quickly, at very low costs. If fees get near 0, they will be able to produce near 0 spam txs. Again, any fee below 10$, for a p2p, immutable, censorship resistant, nearly instant, global transaction, is a bargain.
Depends on what you consider a user. I think Bitcoins killer app is storing wealth without controls. Coming from Greece, I really appreciate having somewhere to store my wealth. I doubt Bitcoin will viable for simple transactions and storing crap on chain (i.e shapeshift txs, low value coloured coins like bitcrystals or storj, coffee payments, tipping etc). Real users, the ones that care about immutability and preserving wealth will use Bitcoin. The rest can use litecoin, dogecoin and dash. Why would you care if you litecoin fucked up and you lost 5$? Litecoin is much better now for this stuff. I am all in for using it for tipping. Stable price in USD and stable clients. Litecoin can hardfork and you lose nothing. Bitcoin forks and many can potentially lose a lot. 12B USD is a lot of money to play with.
In my opinion, Satoshi created Bitcoin to save people from Banks. That was his main goal. Not to help them save money on CC fees or to buy drugs online. 
And fees are important now and will always be. I mentioned how the fee you pay adds to the immutability. Higher fees = Higher mining reward = More miners = More immutability. It isn't about sustaining mining. Fees could become benefitial in incentivising more miners to mine!
Btw, if core devs didn't know what they were doing, I wouldn't be using Bitcoin. It is thanks to them that Bitcoin has gotten so far. If I was going to use another implementation or cry because they are not listening to me, I'd rather dump my coins today. If 100 people haven't started writting code for a blocksize HF, then there is a reason. And my gut tells me that it is the right reason.
Edit : In conclusion, to me, any user that is here not to save himself by the banks and the government, isn't a user.
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:04:31
You probably are. If there was no limit there are profound problems and Bitcoin would seize to work. He didn't mention the 1MB specifically, it might be 8MB, but that is essentially keeping Bitcoin alive. If there were 1GB blocks, almost nobody could validate them and therefore Bitcoin would be dead (No check on miners by nodes aka users)
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:17:29
If you don't want to understand or can't understand, that's not my problem.
Bitcoin can also function with 1 mining pool and 1 node and the rest being SPV. But what would its value be then? Saying the whalepool guy is a retard, is like saying the entire whalepool club is a retard, when olivier is clearly the retard and you are probably more of a retard. Sorry man.
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:38:05
There were many more nodes, but the number dropped due to SPV nodes.
You said it very well. Enthusiasm. That's what you want. I don't buy hype. That's not what Bitcoin is for. If you are a speculator it is good for you. I just don't care about that. I am not gonna get into a blocksize debate here. Especially in r/bitcoin.
1.5 year data not good enough for you? jeez... Also as the costs went up, it is clear the number dropped. And we already had SPV by the date the count started.

@_date: 2016-12-04 03:57:47
I personally don't feel happy with the current numbers. Even 3x the current number isn't enough for me, especially for an emerging network. I can't give an arbitrary number, but every single extra node is valuable. That was my main point. Additional quality nodes are always useful and welcome.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:59:20
Man, you really need to educate yourself.
1. It happened 1.5 year ago in July. There have been full blocks before. People were not really incentivised back then. Now that they want to push a fork, now that's a good incentive to ruin Bitcoin.
2. You make no sense. Most spam transactions pay fees as well. Just not 'priority fees'.
3. 10£ for transfer to an EU bank from the UK is expensive. 4Euros for an incoming transaction is expensive. 0.1-0.2 isn't unnecessarily expensive if it helps nodes save bandwidth and disk space, and help miners buy more equipment and pay elec bills.
4. From articles I've read so far, you are making numbers up. This is clearly wrong. Give a normal source (not Ver's crap) and I will believe you.
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:20:24
That's very true. I did cross the line. I am bored of this debate and people coming in, trying to convert Bitcoin to something they imagine it should be. 
I wrote an entire article debunking this thing and he came here to write the same thing I was attacking. I pointed that to him right on another comment, and what he did was make another different comment, with the exact same things he wrote on his other reddit post.
I am bored of people demanding without doing anything. Want change? Code and let people judge it. If they don't like it, there is probably a god damn reason! People want Bitcoin to scale the way they want, without willing to understand what Bitcoin is and that it is hard to change. They don't understand how fragile the network is and that there are lots of people trying to seize a moment to attack it.
People don't understand what a node or what spam is, nor that Core devs are about 100-200 people that are volunteering their time and have been around probably more than most of us, yet they demand what they feel is best. Telling, that Bitcoin wasn't created to enable financial freedom (when Satoshi specifically stated so), because he saw what was happening with the banks and governments, because people want to buy coffee without fees right now, is fucked up. This behaviour is unacceptable and I'll show no respect to it.
Spoiled Americans, people who have grown up by destroying others, that have harmed this world more than any other country, are the ones that are mainly coming out trying to convert Bitcoin to Paypal 2.0 and 3.0. 1 mistake and it could potentially destroy many people, who have found refuge to this new amazing technology, because they want more business to use bitcoin so that the price goes up.

@_date: 2016-11-30 10:01:52
I don't know if you are new or not, but being able to put something, somewhere where nobody can alter it, that's immutability.
That's why it is used as store of wealth. It doesn't mean that it can't be p2p cash, but this p2p cash can't be cheap. Transaction costs are relative to the use case. You might consider buying a house as a transaction that doesn't have to happen with cash, yet if you have that money in a bank, you risk losing it. 
People want to use large amounts of cash. P2P cash, doesn't mean all cash for all people, all time. Even if I am poor as fuck, I understand that someone not losing shit loads of money due to a failing bank, is much more important than me buying something stupid like an Steam item online. It would be nice that I could and it is that I still can, but I am not going to cry if that doesn't happen if that really changes the world.

50$ per node per hour (if not less). For 5500 nodes that makes the cost about 275k
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:34:07
I don't know the cost. I think they are pretty efficient and their costs are lower than what I mentioned. If you posses the botnet yourself, the cost might be minimal. The only thing stopping you is that there might be a more profitable use case, not how much you pay to maintain the attack.
The price isn't high enough for them. They might not even believe Bitcoin is worth attacking at this point. Trust me, I am not saying this because I think I thought it first. I am just stating something that it is possible and feasible. I am not making a prediction. I made that clear. Possible != probable.
I am not saying all are malicious, but useless. If you someone really understood Bitcoin and was up to date with everything, he could bother upgrading his node and he wouldn't use clients that want to fork Bitcoin. I am mainly doubting the quality too. Remember how all those random XT and Classic nodes popped up? How can I think that their quality is high?
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:03:51
I don't know why you are saying this. Namecoin's and Emercoin's technology might prove useful one day, but I currently doubt it.
I was refering to nodes mainly, not DNS.

Supply will always be capped. Unlimited blocksize can't happen.
Bitcoin can handle loads of 0 fee tx, as they will all get rejected eventually. 
Spam for me is when someone creates a large amount of txs, whose only purpose is to flood the network (with a small fee). Slowly and slightly filling the mempool, so that other people's transactions get stuck (because even dynamic fees can't be determined appropriately during the attack, depending on the intensity). A spam attack like the ones observed at the moment, cost about 10k USD.
Read the comments man. Even Johoe isn't 100% sure whether his research is correct. 1 year of segwit and this data just came out? 
 
The 3.7MB block was a random block on the testnet. The rest are just numbers people are shouting. Until I see some proper research and debate on a paper, I can't say anything. Comments on reddit, by anyone isn't enough for me. Segwit has been on testnet etc for months, how did all this come out now? I am not saying they are wrong, but it is too much talk just from two people.
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:51:01
I am mainly talking about those that want to increase the blocksize. There are also some people that have come out and said that Bitcoin is supported just by the miners and that running a node is stupid and that only companies should do that. Many people value it, but not many are doing it. This sub has 195k subscribers, yet we have only 5k nodes of which most are run by the same people/companies.

Unfortunately, I doubt that there are cheap DDoS defenses (you pay for services to protect you) and security is pretty expensive.
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:06:39
The way Bitcoin has evolved, it seems like it is just about your security and privacy, but it isn't just about that.
Decentralization, check on miners and censorship resistance are some of the reasons why nodes are valuable.
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:14:28
We need to educate people about that, not fuck with the protocol just for their convenience. And if people are here for the long run, ie people from India, China, Greece, Cyprus, Iceland, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, Argentina, Mexico, UK, Italy, where they have all faced, are facing or will face issues with their traditional banking, they won't mind. When you use a new tech, that you don't understand, whose fault is it? You fail once or twice, you do some research and you learn. I failed so many times using the internet and my computer when I was younger, yet it didn't make me feel like I wanted to quit.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:28:44
Both ETC and ETH have the same problems, apart from Vitalik. That's the only bonus ETC has. ETC's low hash rate and that it still has Vitalik's premine are two huge negatives too. 
To me death would be that nobody would be mining and that's how ETC stayed alive even with near 0 marketcap after the split.
They are both failing useless projects. People will realize that pretty soon.

The problem is that some clients will accidentally replay them. That's part of the reason why Core and 2x are playing hide and seek, in terms of Core banning 2x nodes. Because 2x nodes can communicate with core nodes and replay their txs.
Now the most simple thing you can do is this, but you need to be fast and... lucky! With what I proposed, you just created an output that doesn't exist on the other chain and you can taint thousands of transactions with it and use it as a replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:21:35
Before you send it, enable the Replace by fee option. Before it confirms, left click on it and you will see the option to increase the fee. It is very simple and you don't have to type anything. Just press a few buttons. I suggest you do a dummy transaction before to be sure you know how to use it.

Leave the client, but why the wallet? If you empty the wallet and someone 10 years later found that wallet, he would be able to see the history. So his knowledge of Bitcoin at the time was limited. Just copying the wallet wouldn't be the best idea. Replacing it with a random wallet would be one though... I usually change my wallets etc and many times I delete old ones. Nothing unusual with that.

I would really like to hear from Erik, as to which projects aren't scams. An obvious scam was Nubits, yet people can still trade it on Shapeshift. Most appcoins are scams, but Erik doesn't really see it that way. For him, that's innovation! 
I tried very hard to find decent altcoins that weren't premined/instamined/PoS and I ended up with : Litecoin, Namecoin and Monero only.
Nxt, Nem, Maidsafe, Ethereum Classic and Zcash are some interesting projects, but for many reasons, they don't seem viable to me.
Design an innovative and working chain, and then people can decide themselves. It's been 7 years since the birth of Bitcoin and there still hasn't been a serious competitor (Ethereum just makes me laugh).
I was into altcoins and altcoin trading for about 1.5 years. Now that I look back at it, I feel plain stupid for trading scams and being interested in scams, just because they looked like they had some usecase or they solved something Bitcoin hadn't yet solved.

That's true, but that still means that he probably knew about his Bitcoin stash. I don't know how the fingerprint stuff work, but I am talking about fresh ones. I mean ones that are newer, like 2 years ago rather than 5. Maybe carbon analysis? Non an expert, just trying to think anything possible.
I was talking about the guy that stole the coins. After stealing the coins, why leave the client and the wallet there? You must be a bit dumb/clueless if you don't finish the job...

Hi man.
I am really sorry for what happened to you. When I read it and when I was reading the comments, my stomach was upset... What a bad situation to be in.
My advice is to contact as many people in the Bitcoin space and if you need money try to get people to donate for this case. I am very sure that many lawyers that are involved with bitcoin, would be eager to help for little to no money, as that would give them valuable experience. I wish I was a lawyer to help you, but I am not...
I think there is hope. I would not touch the laptop and try and get as much evidence. His phone calls to your parents, to others, everything you can. If you know any of your brothers friends, that are not really related to him, ask them too. But don't let him know that you know what he has done...
Bitcoin is traceable and you should be able to do something if he didn't mix his coins and especially if he cashed out immediately. You could easily make a case if he got a lot of money quickly, without being able to prove how... The hard bit is to get him in a trial. If you do that, I am sure that you'll have enough evidence. He is not in a much better position if he cashed out 100k USD, that was used for drugs.
1. Don't touch/turn on the laptop. Even his fingerprints could be useful. I know you already have, but it might not be too late. As you can see the transactions in his wallet, it means that he was too stupid and didn't delete the wallet and erase all evidence. Hence you can prove that the wallet was owned by your brother.
2. Try and get advice from computer experts and not just normal lawyers/police. If it was a windows laptop, an expert should be able to analyse some of its logs.
3. The amount of theft we are talking about is massive. As long as someone that fully understands bitcoin is involved in your case, you could definitely get something out of it. If they don't, don't even bother.
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:52:26
His own home? We must have read a different story. I don't seem to understand your point as to whose house. We are talking about a man that died and someone walked into THE DEAD'S MAN house and looted his coins, rather than letting his family know.
Bitcoin's ledger is transparent. The early set of transactions is of great importance and many people don't really get that. Before coin mixing, coinjoin etc were available, there was total transparency. No monero, no dash etc, just drug users and dealers transacting. Bitcoin's Blockchain is transparent and during the early days there weren't that many transactions. 
So let me tell you the story again. Someone bought coins in 2011. Someone in 2014 took them and put them in an exchange or mixer. Probably straight in an exchange. Now the brother of the man that passed away, 2 years later found the wallet of his brother, that was looted 3 years after his death and he can see where the Bitcoins went. Not 10 years later, 2. The amount stolen was probably worth more than 80k$ at the time. It is like no wearing gloves when you are going to rob a bank. If someone doesn't know that he owns 146BTC (like the man's family), you make sure they never know he owned any.
Why wouldn't you care? It is a matter of time that bitcoin becomes adopted by many millions and then even more people try to denonymize it and that data might become public.
Again, how the heck were the coins rightfully his?

Which are the two sides? Mike, Gavin, Roger and 5-10% of the community that wants bigger blocks via an alternative implementation?
From the node statistics and the subscribers the big block camp is tiny. I want bigger blocks too, but I want them implemented right and when the time calls for it. It is just not time yet. 
Who am I gonna listen to? P. Todd, A. Back and most of the community or Gavin and Ver? The answer is pretty clear to me.

Well, he is a moderator. That's what you want this sub to be. Reddit is a centralized company and Theymos has no contract with bitcoin, as to how to treat the community. could be the sub that serves the community.

First of all speaking in an other language about something that you need to use specific terminology in order to explain is not that easy and I don't won't to miss out things. 
Also I very inexperienced with presentations (used powerpoint once in my life) and also when it comes to bitcoin I get so overexited that I don't know what to say and in which order. 
The presentation must be short as well, ~5-7 mins max. That is why a good presentation in Spanish or a good website would be useful guides.

He could be funding Core rather than Unlimited. Some of the best programmers in the world are coding for Core, yet he is funding unlimited. He is truly something else...
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:39:04
The ideas of XT, Classic and Unlimited, were all posted in . It was the heavy spam about these implementations and the extreme amounts of posts about them, that was 'cencored'. It wasn't even censoring. They were constantly spamming and they still are. Moderators are needed to control spam on reddit, as there is no other viable way. 
Let's be honest, there is twitter, medium, other subs, bitcointalk.org etc, where people can go and talk about this things. Just because Theymos 'censored' some utter bullshit, Ver started using 'free speech' to act as if he is oppressed, when he is just an egomaniac. That's his way to attract attention. Look, I don't know Theymos and I don't pay attention to what he does. This is his sub and he can do what he fucking wants. Why was BU, not in Scaling Bitcoin? Because their proposals were crap!!!
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:54:08

I want the free market and Bitcoiners want it to. 
When someone lies, you just kick him out. In your life, if a friend of yours lied to you all the time, what would be in your best interest? I think that the best interest for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners is to kick Ver out and I layed the facts. 
I took 2 months worth of tweets, put them here and said that it was BS. If someone wants me to talk more on why they are utter bullshit, I can do it. This isn't a just a free market. It is an open source project, not a company.
Edit : That's what a free market is btw. I can do what I want, in terms of what I say, what I think and which opinions I will endorse. I am free to say that Ver is a threat to Bitcoin and I know most of the community has started realising this.
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:56:39
Not by MIT. MIT doesn't fund core specifically, neither does Blockstream. Blockstream gives some donations and some of the devs work there. The devs are still working for Core on their free time (that's my understanding). I'd also rather avoid MIT, as they want to add AML/KYC on Bitcoin (jesus fucking christ. KYC on Bitcoin, on a protocol level...)
There are lots of people that are coding for core (more than 50), so any additional funding won't hurt.
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:17:48
Oil is valuable, but why is it cheaper now? Gold is extremely valuable, but why is it cheaper? There is a big difference between price and value. Price is what you are required to pay or what you are willing to pay. When Bitcoins were at 1000 were valued, when they were at 150 they were undervalued. Bitcoins value arises from its technology and community. Its price from the exchanges and traders. Got it?
I didn't explain anything poorly, as I just made some statements, over which you made many false assumptions, which you tried to push. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:38:20
Thanks for your response. I am a big fan of yours and of Monero.
Point 2: I don't disagree. Your point is really good. My point was that sybil attacks on masternodes level are not more important than sybil attacks on other nodes. Chris just didn't make sense, as there are normal nodes as well, something that he probably didn't know or neglected. Masternodes just have additional functions, so a big sybil attack just because someone has masternodes has the same probability, if not a smaller one than in Bitcoin (at least if more people get in dash).
My Bitcoin classic example was that when there is no collateral and random non-important nodes of a different variations pop up, they can be used to manipulate people. i.e If classic had managed to have 50-60% of the nodes, we might have had a completely different story. It would be better to see how many people/how much stake is supporting each proposal, rather than by looking and counting client versions.
If a big sybil attack was launched on bitcoin, by many bad actors, the damage will be huge. I am not an expert, so please correct me if I am wrong. With 5000 nodes, of unknown quality and security, Bitcoin could be still get in trouble. Think of the scenario where someone has managed to control all TOR or Chinese nodes, and blocked transactions from these two categories. My guess is that the qt will try and find the peers closest to it. Then that would cause people to start new nodes to start new nodes and that could lead to chaos. I can't see why intelligence agencies couldn't potentially control or create many nodes and attack Bitcoin. Even by controlling 1/2 - 2/3 of the nodes, there is a good probability that all 8 connections are bad. In my opinion, the so called collateral and the rewards can incentivize people to have better quality masternodes, as their stake and payouts are at stake (its value would decrease).
Point 3: I didn't know about it, so thanks for enlightening me. However, I've never heard of 10B open-source project other than Bitcoin. We are talking about people that have 'shares'/'tokens' and their current total value is about 10B USD. Think of how much better it would had been, if Blockstream was a company hired by the Bitcoin blockchain, rather than a company whose employees spend some of their time developing for the Bitcoin Blockchain. What did you think of MIT trying to push the KYC thing in Bitcoin? Have a look at TOR as well. Funding open-source development via corporations and organizations might have been a good thing in 99% of the projects, but I really don't want Bitcoin to be in the 1%... 
Dash and its community might be shit, but that doesn't make the self funding experiment a bad one. Dash will probably fail, but that would be due to its scummy nature, not because of the governance model. If Monero tried a similar model, it would have had much better results. In terms of the desires, have you got a better example on how to represent the desires of the community? Bitshares has a similar system, which has more flaws, but is 100% about what the community desires.
Dash is full of shit. I know that you know and many more people should know. CoinJoin in my opinion is worthless, even in Joinmarket. Instant transactions have not been tested. The instamine and the masternodes can't go together. Instamine can't be overlooked anyways. It all looks like many gimmicks were added so that Evan's premine increases in value.
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:25:45
You must be really stupid. I can't explain it otherwise. I never said that it doubles, nor that satoshi said that. 
I SAID THAT ITS VALUE INCREASES. IT IS MORE VALUABLE, NOT MORE EXPENSIVE.
Disinflation = gradually decreasing inflation. Please, if you are new or have no finance knowledge, don't try to cover the things that you've said.
@_date: 2016-07-04 10:47:47
1. Giving 45% to miners, doesn't mean that they are getting less in terms of $. The fact that masternodes require collateral, increases the price of dash. It is like the Bitcoin halvening. Rewards go down, but price goes up. Also all the additional functions increase the value of the network. Giving just 45% might be very small, but when the value of the network increases, this number can be increased again.
2. In terms of Sybil attacks, I really can't see why Bitcoin is that much safer. Who tells me that a botnet isn't controlling all these nodes, which have no collateral or reward in order to incentivize me to protect my node. Remember what happened with the classic nodes? What would prevent a few ISP to create many nodes and perform sybil attacks?
3. How hard is it to understand that having outside companies funding development isn't as good as internal/community funding? I am not saying Blockstream is bad, but who guarantees that it won't turn bad? Or that another company would offer more money in order to harm Bitcoin? Oh wait, MIT has already tried this!
4. Look at Dash's hashrate and you'll realize that there are ASICS. Dash has a plan to fix the security problem, but that will require deep changes. Masternodes will be the main thing and in my opinion proof of stake or any variation of that protocol will be inevitable for dash (which will probably be a bad thing).
5. Dash is a fork of Bitcoin, so they are building on top. They don't have to be the brightest in order to add stuff on top of Bitcoin.
Sometimes the questions asked on this show seem pretty bad to me, but it is even worse when people can't answer them. I like Amanda and the way she was talking about cryptocurrencies, but she isn't an expert. 
I want to see Dash succeed, but it has way too many flaws and the community is full of sheep (Amanda included). When I pointed out some of the problems, trying to make the so called Monero FUD sound more like advice rather than attacks, they were dismissed pretty quickly.

I agree with most, if not all of your points to some extend. However, the problem is that Amanda couldn't answer this stuff. I really liked the daily decrypt, but going out and preaching about Dash, when you can't understand it, what is the point in promoting it?
They are asking questions, because they want to know. Some of their questions are badly phrased or hard for non-techicals, they are sometimes completely clueless about what they are asking, they have biases etc, but if you can't answer them, why would you promote dash or crypto? They made many false assumptions, but why couldn't Amanda say what you just said? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:16:00
Oh thanks Mr. Smart. Did you ask Satoshi about this? He definitely thought : I am gonna halve the rewards and people will keep mining because fuck it, they have ASICS... I am not saying that this how it works, but in the long run : less inflation = appreciation. Your Bitcoins gain in value, not price. I am not talking about the USD price increase. 1 Bitcoin is 1 Bitcoin. But 1 Bitcoin has higher value when inflation is lower.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:30:07

ASICBoost allegation don't go away. Bitmain has been cornered in many ways and they have no other option. In my 'theory' ASICBoost is a small part of why Bitmain has been blocking Segwit. 
If you want to nullify the danger of a BIP148 split, get all these companies to sign that they will test and run BIP148 by August 1st and signal for Segwit!
Users don't even know what they want or what the results will be, if these things don't come from the best developers.

I've been watching this chart since Dec-Jan too. I believe that them selling hashrate is of low probability.
What I believe they are doing is that are distributing their hashrate to various pools like Bitmain. I noticed that Bitmain controls directly and indirectly about 50-60% of the hashrate. As Bitfury was seen as the only 'opposition' and the 'go to good miner' they probably tried to hide themselves from the spotlight. Especially with all this UASF and NYA crap.
The increase in hashrate doesn't justify them going below 4%. Even if the hashrate doubled, you can't go from 10-11% down to 3%. Bitfury is heavily invested in Bitcoin and I believe they would even mine at a loss.
