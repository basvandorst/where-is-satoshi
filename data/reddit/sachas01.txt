"Legally" No!
Morally depends on how you feel about it. If the cashier making low wages gives you too much change and finds out at the end of the day. And is forced to take it out of her paycheck. How do you feel about getting something free plus extra money? 
You maybe happy when you noticed you got something free and made money but... how do you feel when you find out she cant pay for a meal at the end of the week.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:48:16
So... OP you posted this saying that Bitcoin will succeed cause we believe in it. The man will make us believe it will fail in the medium. But it will be successful cause we dreams n aspire to change the way people will look at it.
Most will ignore and run away like Stephane says. Cause we have opened the door but people have been in the negative state forever and won't change their views.
Development and options that will interest them, maybe more persuasive in the future. Keep on the goals and dreams you have and people will rise up as they see the change for a huge group of people. Wanting to join that change rather than bring those people down with them.

I think it will be okay. I have an account there where I put in the minimal amount of btc. Them the guy who started it sold to "Global Capital Alliance"
What has happen is that they are making sure that all old deposits before the take over are in a legacy fund. Where they will release that to your main fund once they are confirmed to be your. I still have faith in this and since my deposit was small and still make me a few bits everyday I'm not too worried.
I made another deposit since and that bitcoin has made it into my main fund and is available for withdrawal anytime.
Just my opinion. It's gonna be okay.

Hodl your Bitcoin. Control your private key and don't move them till all forks are done and stable. Then scan private keys in future using each blockchain. Hodling all forks in one wallet. Till you decide to split them. I Still have BCH on an original private key. Easy to manage all in one rather than trying to keep track of all forks separately.

Most ways to get into these markets is Bitcoin being the trade for fiat. 
Your looking at these compared to USD.
eth/btc = 0.08
ltc/btc = 0.01
IF Btc is up 100$
in example 
ETH would be up 8.00$
LTC would be up 1.00$
All moving the same way. Only way it would differ is if ETH or LTC would gain or loss on BTC.
Bitcoin is the gateway into these Alts. Most do not trade directly into fiat.

WaveCrest was the only one that gave out these cards to companies that were trying to integrate Bitcoin on the card payment system. Visa killed the service. All companies are trying to find new issuers. Now they must go threw a bunch of BS. Where Visa and other card issuers are holding these companies back from going mainstream and losing business to crypto. Most cryto service was prepaid cards. Even Tenx was a prepaid service that converted instantly from Bitcoin.
Pre paid is not a good business plan for them... Because they don't make interest from card holders only make money from merchants who accept the cards. Cutting out a lot of their income. This is not good for business and will try to hold back all issuers of crypto payments for as long as they can.
