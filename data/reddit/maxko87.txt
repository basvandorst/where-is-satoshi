We handle the returns, cancellations, and all other customer service related issues -- part of our goal is to make the entire purchase experience better for the customer.
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:37:21
We will take care of the returns for you. We get you the return label and get you a full refund as soon as Amazon receives the item.

As it turns out, we can't support affiliate programs (very much against TOS policies). Sorry!

We have over [10k people using the extension.](
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:07:24
We can make it happen.

Thanks for the feedback! We are currently developing Firefox and Safari extensions. If you want to use a different browser right now, we offer a bookmarklet that you can click at checkout to see our "place order" button. Check out our blog post about it [here](

We always match the cancellation and return policies of the merchant you were purchasing from, and often times exceed it. Some of our reviews [here]( highlight our customer service in particular.

We only support the .coms right now. We don't have as much experience finding savings in the EU, so it would be harder for us to maintain our core product there. This is something we will do in the next few months, though.

We don't use Amazon affiliates -- there's a short blurb about where the savings come from on our [FAQ](
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:16:49
That's a good question. We estimate savings at checkout-time with our own algorithms, but these estimates aren't always exactly the savings we come up with. If we're able to save more, we keep the difference, and if we couldn't save as much as we promised, we actually lose money. 
We are using Coinbase to facilitate the transaction. We're cashing out as soon as the purchase is made, so we are not taking a position on the currency.

Hi there! We don't use affiliate links for our purchases, as this violates the TOS of a lot of these retailers. Instead, we often cross-source from other (equal quality) retailers to get savings. We also use the best rewards cards and promo codes if they are available for a particular deal.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:45:20
No catch! I [posted this last week]( on as well -- you can check out the discussion there to read how it works, etc. We just added support for Newegg and Best Buy today, though.

Right below the prices, you can see that "Gift balance will not be applied." We don't use your Amazon gift card -- you're still saving money :)

We have a bookmarklet! Firefox extension coming soon :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:16:02
Absolutely. See [my response here.](

Right now we only support Amazon.com, since it's difficult for us to find better deals for items in Europe. Click "Stay Updated" on [our site]( and we'll let you know when we launch support for .co.uk, .de, .fr, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:39:09
Just click "Get Updates" on the home page and put in your email!

We don't support two-day shipping with Prime -- Amazon loses money on it, and we haven't been able to find a way to get discounts on those orders. Even if you have Prime, for larger orders, we let you sacrifice the faster shipping speed for a discount on the total price.

Wow, seems like there is a lot of demand for this. Will talk it over with my team and see if there's any way we can support this.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:16:41
We currently don't support digital purchases, but this is something we're thinking about.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:54:08
Sorry about that! Shoot me an email or PM and we'll debug.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:29:30
Thanks for the kind words! You were one of our first users, so there was still a few hiccups in the process, but those are all resolved now.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:45:15
There are a few:
1) Instead of charging 2%, we give you savings of around 3-10%
2) You can buy more than one product at once -- this saves you money on shipping fees, which is significant a lot of the time
3) We give you accurate costs for the shipping
4) It's more seamless -- clicking "place order" takes you right to the order page, and you can see all of the orders you've placed online on your Zinc dashboard
We do have fewer retailers supported at this time, but we are actively developing support for more.
