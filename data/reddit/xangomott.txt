80% of the human population doesn’t even HAVE hundreds of bucks to send.  Bitcoin was not made to make rich people happy.  
You like that BTC has effectively outpriced the majority of the human race and will never bring financial sovereignty to the people who need it the most?  Really?  You’re fine with that?  Cuz “muhhh security”. ?
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:16:10
A thing doesn’t need to be so secure that it’s unusable.  
A thing can be sufficiently secure and remain usable.   
A thing that is so excessively secure that 80% of the human population can’t afford to use it, will never get used.  
This “security has a price” crap needs to die a quick death.  
Nothing says you can’t keep bitcoin cheap AND secure.  There are ways.

And 80% of the human population who make less than $10 a day.  Remember them ?

False. A digital shiny yellow rock in electronic format is not utility. 
Using it as a payment system, currency, transfer of value, public ledger, and censorship resistant money, is its utility. 
I wish this whole community would stop with the store of value/electronic gold nonsense. Bitcoin didn’t get to where it is today by pretending to be Gold. It grew to well over 100,000 merchants accepting it as a payment option for a reason. 
This is our number one priority.

I love that a blatantly anti crypto post gets 500+ upvotes on the bitcoin sub.  ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-13 06:49:17
Reasonable isn’t allowed here anymore.  Only vitriol and misinformation to dupe the uninformed into hating the fork which seeks to scale bitcoin on chain.  You should know that by now.  
Calling it “Rogers sub” is just more falsehood intended to malign a huge project with nearly 6 dev teams (that have zero ties to Roger) and support from the entire industry (companies that couldn’t care less that Roger even exists).

Fourth’d.  Lightning is doing fine.  We always want new tech under development to stay ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:47:40
Are you new here?  Blows my mind how people can be so dense that they actually think USING bitcoin for what it was made for is a negative. 
Spend and replace if you’re so bent out of shape over Bitcoin pizza guy.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:12:42
It used to be under a penny.   Stop allowing yourselves to be desensitized to high fees. 
80% of the human population makes less than $10 a day.  
If Bitcoin isn’t affordable for them, it has been changed in a manner that ruins its entire reason for being invented.

What’s so hard for you to understand about his comment?  He’s 1,000% right.   Bitcoin was made to be a currency. Not a shiny fake digital rock that does nothing.

I’ve got to know: what’s the rationale behind the guy who posts something that 75 people have already posted in the last 24 hours? 
Like what’s the thinking that goes into that? AMA?

To be honest it’s really really weird you just wrote three paragraphs of text and you didn’t even know what the case was about. 
But welcome to Reddit, right?  
Who needs actual facts when you’ve got a bias you need to push to influence other people’s opinions?
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:10:42
Without users, the miners are not going to “like” it for very long.  
Miners would prefer 70% of the worlds population using bitcoin as a worldwide currency with tiny fees, versus only a few people using it to buy a house with big fees. I can guarantee that.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:04:41


I’m sorry, what? 
You’re going to brush off the fact that 90% of your population can’t afford these fees and say they’re “paying anyway because they’re used to paying fees“?
Yeah, no.  
If these people are making $11 a month, they’re not paying $4.50 for one transaction. Let’s keep it real here.
Either you are fairly well-off and completely out of touch with your own people, or you’re not being honest about the fee problem. 
You say they’re trying not to starve. 
These fees will help them starve. Bitcoin is not usable in Venezuela. Why are you pretending like everything is fine with it?

OP, you incredible noob, please feel feee to ask me any noob questions.  I’ll be available all day.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:21:36
Just out of curiosity, what are you going to do in 12 months when BTC trade and transaction volume is quadruple what it was during the last bull run?
Fees likely pushing past $100 and taking 2-3 weeks to move.  SW and LN are not adopted / ready yet so that’s not a valid response.  
Bitcoin will be more expensive than every other existing financial transfer method on earth. 
More expensive than every bank. 
More expensive than every overpriced remittance company. 
In other words, it will have absolutely no benefit to anyone. 
So all these “idiots” you refer to will actually end up being right.  Because this is been their message from the start.  
What then?  More blind denial regarding how poorly this project has been managed?
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:37:32
The ideals of the original Bitcoin are already lost.  Have you not been paying attention the last 2 years?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:26:54
Honestly this is such an annoying response, and there’s always one guy that has to say it.
The whole point is that it’s being accepted as a payment option. 
Do you grasp how massive that is? It doesn’t matter what they do with it. They could throw it against the wall, stick it in their ear, or frame it and worship it all day. 
It doesn’t matter what they do with it.
This is encouraging the use of bitcoin as a payment option. It’s a step towards worldwide acceptance as a currency. That much bigger picture is much more important than whether they HODL or convert.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:12:01
We did not create bitcoin to be equal to, or more expensive and slower than the existing banking system. That’s why it matters.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:44:31


What???????   ����‍♂️
You guys have lost your marbles. 
Who are you people? 
Three years ago this is literally what it was ALL ABOUT. 
Merchant adoption. USAGE.  
Every single fucking person in this ecosystem said the very opposite of what you just wrote. 
EVERY single person here. 
That’s how Bitcoin EVER became what it is today. 
Wake up.

No.  Literally anyone with an IQ over 12 who isn’t so lost in their lines of code that they can see the obvious problem on the table.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:13:48
None of that is an issue with rational, moderate scaling on chain to a certain level.  
And as bandwidth and storage space becomes cheaper over time, you will have a growing number of people who are able to afford to secure the network. 
This is literally a non-issue.

100% agree regarding Shrem.  
His reputation in crypto is quite literally “the cocky childish guy who royally fucked up”.  That’s pretty much it.  
He did a good job acting natural, self deprecating, and not cringey though.  I’m thankful for that.  
Aside from that - yeah - it’s Andreas who needs to be on a 30 minute segment with 60 minutes.  It would blow EVERYONE away.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:40:25
Because the potential it had, has been killed by making it no longer usable as a currency.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:03:52


Interesting theory. Please provide the documentation proving that “X MB” block size equals “Bitcoin is now centralized”. 
To phrase it another way: do we become centralized at 2 MB blocks? 6 MB blocks? 10 MB blocks? 
I’m sure the research has been done right? You guys wouldn’t make a massive decision that causes Bitcoin to lose 50% market dominance and loss of merchant adoption without actually having verified facts to back it up. 
If there are 10,000 nodes at 1MB,
7,543 nodes at 6MB, and
6,988 nodes at 10MB, 
has Bitcoin become “centralized” and in risk of failure?  Complete loss of this important status called “secure”?  
If not, at what point does this ominous centralization monster actually appear?  
And why don’t we raise the block size limit until it gets to a point where there’s actually a concern?  So bitcoin can remain cheap and usable until we have perfected and built-out layer two systems to help take the load off?
