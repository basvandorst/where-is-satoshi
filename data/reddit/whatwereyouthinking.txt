Just say "hey, look it up on Wikipedia, its really awesome! Have a nice dayy!!"   
  
If i said that I'd feel like I went above and beyond in my people interactions  that day.

Eating up cheap btc!   
  
Dammit Coinbase for using MtGox for your pricing. They're obviously not interfacing with them, why would they do that. CB price dropped big time overnight. Good news for me though. I doubled my btc holdings and couldn't care less what it does over the weekend, or month, or hell this year!!

Primecoin was up around 7 bucks for a while.

Easiest way.

Because that would require more effort. i pulled my phone out of my pocket and made the transfer.

After the spike of over $1000, i bought 1btc at a "low" price of $920. Sounds scary right?  From an investment standpoint maybe, but from a currency standpoint, not really. Here's why: even that dramatic of a shift only "cost" me ~$250 and I still have 1btc!! Which is really all that matters. Once you go into btc, you cant look at dollars anymore. 
  Its also worth mentioning that in the subsequent waves i was able to profit over $200 with that 1 bitcoin on btc-e. So i guess you could say i kept up with deflation.

correct. i'm just pointing out what I had to do to convert A (bitcoin) into D (a nice TV).  
  
The only fee i paid was getting the money off of Coinbase. which I think was a few bucks, no worries though, i knew that going in.

Like Primecoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:44:57

That usually won't get you in trouble. Its telling them you smoked a bowl/bong and have more. NOW they have something to look for. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:45:35
yes. or you will find yourself trying to register a variant of my username in the near future.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:24:11
Agreed, especially if you are sending/receiving money offshore.

What I don't understand is *WHAT* is making everyone think that this liquidation is going to cause a drop in price? has anyone come out and said "hey, i ran the numbers, and..." Not that I know of.  
  
I think what's happening here, is this is a new currency, and it recently had a major price spike, now everyone wants on board and they're trying to get their finger on the pulse of this to find out if they are going to ~~double~~ triple their life savings, or lose it all in a day. The problem is, there is very little pulse. there is no one government, agency, authority, central bank, central exchange, or anyone to give bitcoin a rating.  
  
that said, we read a story about bitcoin, and lets be honest, you do this too. you say to yourself "is this good, or bad? will the price go up, or down?"  
  
"Netflix announces they will accept bitcoin" UUUPPPPPP TO THE MOOOOOOON!!!!!  
  
Ching Chang of the Chinese Central Bank says he swallowed and shat a bitcoin this morning. OH GOD NO!!! SELLLLOLLLL!!!  
  
For this currency to mature, we need to mature.

Never have a big wallet on a system. Spread them out or go cold.

Most good keyloggers capture anything going through your clipboard.  So while lastpass is great, be cautious of the "copy password" function.
