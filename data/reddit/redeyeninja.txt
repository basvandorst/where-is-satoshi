80% of these comments are why people hate bitcoin's community

I don't think I would sell if the price dropped because I don't think the currency will stay low for long. Virtual currency is here to stay imo, its just a question if someone can gain momentum faster than bitcoin.
I am 22 and making the money back wouldn't be easy, but I'd survive. I have a fulltime job which maintains me but doesn't always allow me to put a lot in savings.

My main thought is that even if it does crash, I can hang onto it until the market recovers. I just see this as something that isn't going away anytime soon, especially with global economic uncertainty. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:42:30
I didn't consider that, thanks!

You sound like your wining at craps right now lol. But your plan of holding onto them for a while is basically what I'm thinking. I wish you the best of luck brother, hopefully ill be on the roller coaster ride up soon enough.

I've seen this mentioned, but I don't know much about it. I need to do some research into paper wallets.

I know its a gamble, but the odds seem to be with Bitcoin. Do you realistically see the market tanking soon? If so, why? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:33:47
I'm scared of a loss, but I'm even more anxious about a missed opportunity. And I wouldn't expect that, but I figure this community is more knowledgable than most on the subject. I am still doing research on the economy but I figured Reddit is a great resource for the opinion of people actually involved with the market

I think I fall into the not very smart category at the moment, but hopefully that will change soon. Thanks for the advice!

I am totally lost in what I'm doing, thats why I asked you kind folk! But I know I have a ton to learn about the market before this is a serious investment.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:18:49
This is great advice, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:04:41
Shit man, one of the most helpful posts so far. I appreciate your honesty. I don't have an eye for the markets yet but I am going to be watching them to spot trends. Seriously, thanks!

I know it's too late for millionaire dreams, but I figure my idle money can do a little better than it is currently in a savings account. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:22:39
I'm young and dumb enough to be ok with some risk. But I think Reddit is a great resource not an authority, so I take the info with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:52:48
That is what I'm thinking as well after all these comments. 10% to start and see how that works out for me
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:20:42
I already started exploring that site, really useful info. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:01:36
Jumping to conclusions a little? And Reddit isn't a determining factor, just a great resource for info
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:26:37
Well my reasoning is that Bitcoin isn't going to just stop being used at this point. It is made up of a bunch of little people that believe in the concept (enough to invest) and even if the price did dramatically drop, I don't think it would be too long before it rebounded. The philosophy of Bitcoin is what attracts me to it most and I guess its giving me an almost blind faith in its success.

Nothing in this world if a sure thing, I just think this has a ton of potential. It would really suck loosing 50% of my savings, but its collecting dust right now in a savings account. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:44:54
Very true. From all the responses, I'm thinking my initial % was too bold lol. 10-15% sounds like that is the max, which would leave me with enough reserve to play around with the market if the time arose.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:52:02
Great post, thanks! I fit your criteria but I do have student loans. I am currently still in college so I don't pay those until I graduate but its my only debt. I have been seeing them in the news a ton recently. And economics is mostly speculation in my opinion which is why I think the media attention will increase btc's value.
So you put 100% into btc? have you seen a gain or loss since then?
