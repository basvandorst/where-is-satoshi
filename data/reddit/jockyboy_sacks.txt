If I use bitcoin CLI to generate master key it should work fine with master public key?
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:01:17
So what you're saying is use electrum to generate the addresses then save them to a file or the database so the server software can pick one thats unused? I've been developing it using RPC and I need to be able to use getnewaddress()
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:58:09
So getnewaddress will work with just a read only key?
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:09:47
Thats exactly what I'm looking for, going back to documentation now.

If it doesnt require xpub or priv key then obviously the coins arent getting sent from client to your control.. You have no way of generating your own addresses deterministicly for orders without them. The only way theres address per order without using pubkeys and third parties is you're trusting the third party to handle the money and send it to an address you provide. I know enough about it that thats what you did. Not an option the second it leaves the clients wallet it needs to land in one of my wallets. No having to trust third party.

I use the MPK to generate addresses and verify using RPC. I'm interested in the be your own bank aspect of bitcoin. I dont want to have to have a third party handle my money or keep information about the transaction.
@_date: 2019-10-12 04:24:29
So that would work for running wallet and blocknotify scripts on the VPS?
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:26:59
Master Public Key, you can generate wallets on a read only basis with it deterministically. You can find it on electrum by going to wallet information. Its also called "xpub". But as I said if I wanted to just track one wallet all I'd have to do is run a walletnotify script that tells my file the balance and sends me a notification, I just want to be able to do this with multiple wallets with one node. I'm going to try the older executable and try using accounts. If anybody has the 'new' way of doing it I'd appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:20:21
any providers that accept bitcoin at those prices? I want to support the ecosystem by going through other crypto accepting merchants and service providers
@_date: 2019-10-13 04:42:44
Sounds like what youre doing is having them handle your money and they send it to you afterward. I'm not interested in using BitPay or anything like that. I already have working code I wrote for a full node to manage it myself.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:49:30
The servers for the apps have DBs that keep track of payments. However on my computer I dont have the same scripts running and I dont want extra copies of the DB there. I need it to be able to detect payments for any deterministic address for each wallet. What you described with accounts sounds exactly like what I'm looking for but since its depracated I dont want to implement it for it to not work in the next year or two so whats the replacement for it?
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:17:36
I'm only asking about SSH so I can run my walletnotify and blocknotify scripts on the server cause the scripts interact with the database to keep track of payments. If my blockchains on the host how will SSH cause walletnotify to trigger on my applications server? From my memory of when I was programming the script wallet notify is triggered by bitcoind. Running normal RPC commands through port forwarding is the only part that sounds intuitive. From my understanding the bitcoind port is only for connecting to other nodes for syncing blockchain. Like if bitcoind that has the full node is on my local computer then wouldnt it only be possible for that bitcoind to trigger walletnotify on my local computer which doesnt have access to my DBs?
This question has nothing to do with other services running on my web server, it only has to do with bitcoin core and SSH. The host OS is a Linux distro so thats relevant but its assumed by your link. I'm confused as to how walletnotify would trigger on my web server since bitcoind with the full blockchain would be on the local server.
@_date: 2019-10-12 05:23:11
Do you know of any guides or resources to help set this up? I'm assuming that I need to have bitcoin core installed on machines and that in the daemon on the app server make a setting to use SSH to another machine for accessing walletnotify. Does using SSH like send a walletnotify event to the app server and then trigger my walletnotify or how would it work?
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:29:26
Oh yeah then elaborate. Cause thats the only way possible to deterministicly generate addresses under your 100% control. Who are you trying to impress?
@_date: 2019-10-19 00:25:01
Thats what literally every store that accepts crypto ever does so that its easier to keep orders and payments from different customers differentiated LMAO thats how bitcoin was designed to work begin with. Why do you think they make one Master Public Key and Private key to derive multiple addresses to begin with, just to waste memory?
@_date: 2019-10-19 03:43:15
Yeah if I was building a darknet market I wouldnt be worried about not being able to afford hosting as stated for the original reason why I asked for a cheaper node hosting solution lmao. Just dont reply if you dont have anything of value to offer to the conversation. Bitcoin was made to be able to control your own funds and all the bitcoin software even says you should only use addresses once. I have working code for accepting bitcoin as originally intended and I simply asked about ways that others cheaply hosted their nodes.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:23:46
Yeah, the way I said. Has nothing to do with being cleaver. If you dont have the MPK then theres no generating address per order. You'd have to provide addresses to third party and query third party periodically vs having an instant notification through a full node. I know enough and I know I cant use third party APIs for my need.Third party APIs are only useful for fetching exchange rates.
@_date: 2019-10-28 07:18:30
Because MPK has unlimited addresses and I cant generate them all on my computer to specifically watch them. I just want to know if a wallet has received any money and my script to tell me which wallet it was so I can go check orders on the different apps. I thought if you use old versions it wont send to the currect chain and that each chain is attached to each release.
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:31:43
So couldnt I then on the bitcoin node server instead of connecting via SSH put a URL in there and put transaction info in the URI through GET? Asking as a hypothetical as to whether its possible and not suggesting I think it'd be a better way to do it. That way you could potentially do it over HTTP requests back and forth with a custom API instead of perpetually connected via SSH.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:14:39
Ok I cant find any guides to do that. Do I launch the first "bitcoind -regtest -daemon" to get the .bitcoin node then do I use "bitcoind -regtest -daemon -datadir=/test/" to get one started for my /test/ node then "bitcoin-cli -regtest addnode [127.0.0.1:10340]( onetry" to connect /test/ to /.bitcoin/ then "bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/test/ addnode [127.0.0.1:18443]( onetry" to connect /.bitcoin/ to the /test/ node?
Also how do I pass rpc login parameters? Seems to me when I launce bitcoind it always defaults to the RPC user and password I set in .bitcoin because when I had a different password for /test/ I would get authorization failed and that went away after I set both to same user name and password.
Ok so I did this:
./bitcoind -regtest -daemon -datadir=/test/
That did generate a regtest folder with a wallet.dat and everything.
So I used ./bitcoin-cli stop to stop it from running because I wanted both blockchains to be the same. So then I did
./bitcoind -regtest -daemon
./bitcoind -regtest -daemon -datadir=/test/ -connect=127.0.0.1:18443
The second statement produced a warning:
Warning: Config setting for -port only applied on regtest network when in [regtest] section.
Warning: Config setting for -rpcport only applied on regtest network when in [regtest] section.
Bitcoin server starting
I continued though:
./bitcoin-cli addnode 127.0.0.1:10340 onetry
That should of synced my nodes right? How do I check if /test/ and .bitcoin are using the same chain? I continued:
./bitcoin-cli -datadir=/test/ getnewaddress
returned: 2N6FG3zaKSdH5sXb1TRvp3ebp4P6Rfgn8Lk
./bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress 2N6FG3zaKSdH5sXb1TRvp3ebp4P6Rfgn8Lk 3
returned: f932ff4488958d29f714d2f8270add94875a4bce39cc82c5292100edeb34c0ec
./bitcoin-cli gettransaction f932ff4488958d29f714d2f8270add94875a4bce39cc82c5292100edeb34c0ec
That ends up returning with the same exact problem as before, where did I go wrong?

So I found this
I created the second node and used -datadir=/test/ with a new bitcoin.conf with basically the same settings as in their example and same rpcuser and rpcpassword (because bitcoin-cli would say authorization failed when they had conflicting passwords). In my datadir nothing generates nor does ./bitcoin-cli -datadir=/test/ getinfo work, it always returns:
error code: -32601
error message:
Method not found
but I can use ./bitcoin-cli -datadir=/test/ getnewaddress
and it does generate a new address. However if using the RPC to connect to the datadir=/test/ node and I try to sendtoaddress from that node to the default regtest node no transaction ID is returned.
In .bitcoin/regtest/debug.log I have a whole bunch of these:
2019-09-03T23:50:01Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:10340 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)
2019-09-03T23:51:02Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:10340 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)
2019-09-03T23:52:02Z connect() to 127.0.0.1:10340 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:28:47
I started the first one using the "./bitcoind -regtest -daemon" then I used "./bitcoin-cli addnode 127.0.0.1:10340 onetry" then "./bitcoin-cli -datadirr=/test/ getnewaddress". That returned a new address but I get that error using getinfo. When I tried on the command line to make a transaction using datadir in CLI it makes transaction but when I use gettransaction with either it still says amount: 0. I followed that post I found pretty much exact.
Is this running the multiple nodes? My /test/ folder doesnt have its own regtest or wallet files or anything like that.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:47:54
I am definitely using same regtest node. I have a simple controller I made that uses getnewaddress to generate new addresses, generatetoaddress to generate a given amount of blocks and give coinbase transaction to address to create a balance, then a function to send given bitcoins to a given address to test walletnotify and blocknotify scripts. 
The regtest documentation I used doesnt say anything about it just how to set up the regtest mode and then goes on to basic functions of the CLI.
Could you point me to a guide to setting up a second node? I dont know intuitively because I assumed there can only be one .bitcoin to store a bitcoin.conf file to set it to use different nodes.
From there I'm assuming I do the following. I should use the node with my applications wallet to generate getnewaddress and then for my sendtoaddress plus generatetoaddress calls I'd use the node for a wallet that is a separate spending wallet. This would make sense right?
