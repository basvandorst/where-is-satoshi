ayyy HODL GANG 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:10:16
the one and only true cryptocurrency, man. Bitcoin. BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:18:15
hasn't RSK already launched for bitcoin? 
Smart contracts for bitcoin are already underway. correct?

coinbase isn't ready for primetime yet again
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:26:59
off the exchange and into a wallet (such as paper wallet or hardware). basically, off the grid
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:18
everyone who hodls now, is earning their stripes in the army that is bitcoin. 
after this coordinated attack period is over and BTC rises again beyond ATHs, everyone who hedl, will also rise new, glorified, and strong.
just like BTC.
the hodlers become an image of the coin they hold. 
Unable to be controlled, battle hardened, and strapped in for a ride to the moon. 
never give up, never give in. give them nothing, take from them everything. HODL.

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:28

i registered to gemini today and am in the process of taking everything off of gdax/coinbase. 
we have to vote with our money. we have to speak with our money. 
enough little guys combined, can do it.
like in Horton hears a who 
or in DBZ with the spirit bomb.
except when im raising my hands all my money is going to gemini
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:00
this is some cheese. almost at 20k, exchange crashes and now we back to like 16k?
some cheese for real
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:41:17
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:32

@_date: 2017-12-04 16:56:42
Mmmm.. Love me some moon math..~

COINBASE AIN'T READY FOR PRIME TIME
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:03:05
you have my bow
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:36:44
there is no real war. bcash is just making noise like a crying baby while Bitcoin is doing it's own thing. not caring at all.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:30:40
always hold your bitcoin in a personal offline wallet where you own your own private keys.
exchanges are vulnerable to hacks (they have happened in the past) and they are not legally responsible if such an event were to occur to your precious coins.
I'd recommend a trezor to store your btc.

congrats to those who hedl
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:50
of course, man. we are in this for the long haul. lol HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:13
gdax? more like, stupid dax. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:44
we might see 20k today...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:12
this. so much this. 
this comment is speaking more about people's irrational demands and desires.
Not so much about BTC, itself.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:23:13
wow, what a guy!
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:34:04
LOL this was the funniest post I've seen in a while
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:44:27
lol dyor... 
but I will say one thing about Koreans. Koreans are the FOMO kings and queens of the universe and due to the confuscianistic nature of korean culture, sending btc to one address is not unlike what the power rangers try to do when they assemble the megazord- pooling their resources together and becoming one in an effort to gain strength/position over an evil alien bad guy (probably now in the form of abject poverty or enslavement to Samsung Corp.)
and yes, I'm a korean.   
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:31:45
cash app hasn't rolled out support for everyone yet in places like georgia and ny, hawaii...etc. 
dunno why.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:40:45
What a good man!
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:47:17
my credit actually is higher than 800 doe... lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:30:56
Yes! Tried to put it on the debit card lol. But I also told the boa rep earlier that day that I would.  
The kicker to this whole situation? She actually told me while chuckling through some small talk that it's my money. 
oh the humanity
