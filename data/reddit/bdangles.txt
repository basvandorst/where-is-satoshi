gemini or gdax. free ACH deposit/withdraw. ~0.25% buy/sell maximum fee (little different depending on maker/taker, but thats the max fee).
gemini has "immediate deposits" meaning you can buy coins immediately after you deposit cash. the only limitation is you can't take your coins off the exchange for 4-5 days until the deposit formally clears. gemini verification also takes like a week or so. get on it now!

I should preface that my understanding is cursory.


Yes I believe you are correct. In theory, gemini could support both chains. This is unlikely because gemini is owned by the Winklevosses, who are bitcoin maximalist. There's a reason why LTC is not on gemini.


This is a tricky answer. If the split chain happens, yes price will inevitably fall because of panic. If the it doesn't happen, then price will probably rocket up. It's hard to predict what will happen, as none of us can predict the future. My recommendation is to read as much as you can -- both factual information of segwit2x and USAF as well as analysis/opinions.
Once you come to an understanding, I would say do not make an exclusive buy or wait decision. Buy as much as you are willing to lose. If you don't think the split will happen, buy semi-heavy. If you think the split will happen, buy lightly.
It is also not a bad idea to buy over time. I.e. if you have $2,000 to spend over the next 3 months, buy in $40 increments if you think theres still possible downside. Once it hits a big dip (-20%), buy a $200 increment. Ideally overtime, your average price per bitcoin that you've paid will be *much* lower than some of the buys you made at the top.

yes they do. the reason why gdax exists is to compete with conventional exchanges (and mostly to compete with gemini). coinbase exists for the sole purpose of unknowing plebs just wanting to get into the crypto game and don't care about fees.
