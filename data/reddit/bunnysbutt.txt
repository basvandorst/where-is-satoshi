Honestly speaking, whether this is a bubble being popped or not, it's a good lesson we are all learning. (Given that no idiot would've put in more than one could afford). Cryptocurrency is, whether you like it or not, the 'medium' we'd be using instead of the current dollars, yen, yuan, won, etc. Just enjoy the ride and see what you can get out of it.
