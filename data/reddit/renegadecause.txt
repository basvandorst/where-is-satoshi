The US equities market is something like 25 trillion (yes, trillion).  Cryptos all together (including all the alt coins) make up $373 billion. Bitcoin makes up $226 billion.
This is a drop in the bucket.  Additionally, I don't believe a collapse in the crypto sphere wouldn't spur a sell of in equities or bonds. They're not exactly correlated in any sort of way. If anything, equities and bonds are my "safer" havens and I would never consider selling them off to pick up more cryptos.

I'm not just a straight up "fuck Coinbase/Bitcoin Cash." I'm really only interested in profits, I just like stability and think the roll out could have been handled better. I do question to some extent the run up that preceded the announcement, but I'm seeing there was some evidence that there it was as soft a rollout as possible - totally legal, just underhanded IMO. Why not just send out an email to all users stating: "We'll proudly be offering Bitcoin Cash in two days."?

Basically, there's two main ways to look at investing - based on value and based on growth. People investing in value buy what they feel are undervalued assets. They're making the assumption that they have identified these assets and expect them to rise to their actual value.
Growth investors are expecting momentum to build and sustain price of the asset. You can think of this as pie-in-the-sky or the next-fool construct. In essence you're buying something regardless of what it's actual value is in the belief that some poor schmuck will buy the asset for more money. This happens until people realize that the asset itself isn't worth what people are paying for it, and someone ends up holding the bag as people are trying to sell at prices that no one is willing to buy.
The underlying problem with cryptos is that it's such a new field we can only guess what the true values are (there aren't financial statements like there on stocks or bonds). That means it's difficult to assess their true, underlying value, which leads a lot of people to rely on momentum trading. This also leads people to talk about "entering bubble" territory.
In my opinion, though, we only are in a bubble *once sufficient numbers of people believe we're in a bubble and price growth not only stalls but reverses*.  Which is essentially what happened with the dotcom bubble, especially with a lot of the nonviable companies (like pets.com)

In the short-term yes.  All the cryptos I have positions in are still above where they were a month ago. But do you stop DCAing just because VTI is snowballing? I'd also like to point out that not all stocks offer a dividend.
There's an undeniable higher risk value to cryptos, but the basic principle is the same.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:28
I'm not sure. Wasn't involved in cryptos when they did, but soft, mid-day rollouts aren't responsible, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:42:37

Hey, if it's a tremendous hassle that you have to go through to just use a *$100* bill (because they think it's fake and they have to document it just to make sure), don't complain when they have to document it to be sure because after the **FIRST** time you ought to recognize how that's how things are done in the country you're living in.  If you're stupid enough to continue breaking $100 dollar bills, then you kind of lose your right to complain because you know the **custom**, which is the exact word I used.
