I think it's better to choose carefully projects to invest in. Because too many projects are scam. I trust only such projects as Svandis.

2018 is not ended, so we will see lambo. Especially those one who invest in Credits. It's very unique and promising  project. Their Alpha version of CREDITS showed a speed of 488 403 transactions per second during the testing.

So world accepts crypto, even Uganda, that's awesome. And one oof the best projects for our future is Credits. It is blockchain of new generation. They use new type of consensus – dPoS and BFT. It gives an opportunity to perform more than 1 mln transaction per second with very low fee.Credits platform will have several types of nodes: common, trusted and main.The requirements to become a node - good internet connection, computer where a complete network client is installed.Main node receive 50% of the transaction fee as a reward, the rest 50% is distributed between trusted nodes.

Agree, an I think that most of us here in are for making money. I'm waiting a lot from such projects as Tron, Eos and Credits
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:42:56
Unfortunately, yes
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:34:21
I'm really sure about Credits and Vechain. ANd I didn't mention that I didn't invest in Bitcoin. Just think that long-term projects such as Credits will make me rich
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:39:13
You're fucking right, guy! I want the same. That's why I invested in Tron, Credits and Vechain, I think they will be successful
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:02:41
I don't see the future of bitcoin, because young projects are more prospective than bitcoin. They're faster, more secure and can use blockchain technologies to solve many problems of people and companies. One of these projects are Vechain and Credits
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:54:36
So I agree with it and do the same. And most of all I buy Credits. I believe in this strong project. Excellent platform with good information delivery, everything is available and understandable even for beginners. I think everyone who is involved in the crypto should take part in it.

Credits's also an amazing platform with good information delivery, where everything is available and understandable even for beginners. I think everyone who is involved in the crypto should take part in it. It will change the future 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:21:35
Of course, I believe in blockchain technology and that they can solve many problems, too. I meant that the first reason for many of us is money. But I don't ignore the profit that blockchain technology will bring us in the future

Do you have Credits tokens? What Cristophe Ozcan said about Credits: "Patience leads to salvation, rush to misery. Who wants to do great things must think deeply about the details because evil is behind. Be patient the revolution is coming soon".
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:36:50
Agree, + hardworking team and reliable partners

Good choice. But I think that Credits has more opportunities to become project No 1 in the future. Some of them are: Why Credits is faster than other blockchains - 
 Credits platform security technology -

They defo will survive, agree, but as for me, Credits is more competitive than others. One of the reasons is that they have unique consensus type that consists of dPos and BFT and that gives them a great advantage of achieving 1 mln tps
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:25:27
For me it's not strange, and about Credits, too. They develop really fast, so no wonder that they are one of the first in it
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:32:40
Not only. There are also many organisations that Credits partner with. For example, this: It's an article about how CREDITS offers a blockchain solution for human capital management to Andhra Pradesh Government and cooperates with a university in India

Credits platform is secure because Cs team use unique security technologies, such as BLAKE2s hashing algorithm, Homomorphic encryption, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Improving the compression function, Reduction in the number of constants
