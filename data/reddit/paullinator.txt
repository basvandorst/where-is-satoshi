What device are you on? On iOS all those things are optional, the OS asks you for permission for each thing individually and you can deny each one and the app works fine. 
On Android it was an all or nothing. We couldn't only ask for some of the permissions. Not until Android M did the system support having the app be granted only some of the permissions. We simply haven't had the bandwidth yet to look into Android's new API to allow partial permissions but we do intend to within our next couple releases.
Note that if privacy is what you're concerned about, Airbitz ranked  in Android apps for privacy by the OBPP report. We've tried hard to strike that balance of usability and security/privacy. I appreciate your feedback. Keep it coming as it helps us improve.
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:39:39
We honestly would prefer NOT to force any of that on users. It was simply an all or nothing until Android M. However for us to create the popup requesting for permission, we would have to increase the minimum Android version to 5.0 thereby eliminating old Android versions from using the app at all.
However, I looked into the permissions in Android, and as of Android M, you can now revoke permissions from any app in the Settings and simply not allow Airbitz (or any other app) to have access to contacts, location, etc. Airbitz can run perfectly fine without any of those although we have a small crash bug when Location services are revoked. This has been fixed in our internal build so the next release of Airbitz can have all those permissions revoked and still run fine.
Thanks again for the feedback and applying the pressure to have us look into this.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:58:08
I don't understand your point. Sure you can go overboard the put layers upon layers of encryption. But the reason to "stop there" is that at least one layer of encryption (plus auto backup) on the private key means that the private key is never displayed to the user and therefore not prone to the attack of keyloggers or screengrabbers.
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:18:20
While I respect your opinion, we'd like to learn what triggers your comments regarding unnecessary "services" and "bloatware" as we of course want to improve. I assume the bloatware you are referring to is in regards to the plugins that are in the wallet. Much of those are in response to some of the most requested functionality (buy/sell bitcoin, and how to use bitcoin). And we've made it as non-impacting to the UI as possible. None of those 'services' are forced on the user. There are absolutely NO "popups" in the wallet for those services.
Some of the services are listed on the Transaction List screen only when that screen is blank, ie. for a new account. Once transactions come in, those listings are pushed to the bottom where they make zero impact to the UI.
So while I understand differences of opinion, we would also appreciate constructive criticism to help improve the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole vs hammering a product w/o reason. I will happily make myself available for a brief chat over phone or Skype if you'd like to discuss.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:51:54
Thanks for the feedback. Everything the app asks for is to improve ease of use. Note that a common misconception is that the app accessing this info also means the company has access. In the case of Airbitz, that's not necessarily true. Here's why the app asks for all the above. And note that the entire platform is open source so you can verify what I've said:
Identity/Contacts: To autocomplete transaction payee info to help users tag their transactions. All tagged info is encrypted local, client-side and nobody has access other than the user.
Location: Simply for the merchant directory to help find listings
Photos: Allows users to scan QR codes from their photo album
Files: Allows app to include QR code attachments in email payment requests
Camera: Needed to scan QR codes
Bluetooth: Allows sending public address over Bluetooth/BLE so you can pay without scanning a QR code. Great when you're at a table with friends to pay back dinner or outdoors where glare can make it hard to scan a QR.
Hope that helps you understand how all this access is utilized to really improve experience and not compromise privacy or security.

Issa just left our office and I have to say that he is a VERY balanced voice that heavily believes in minimal govt. He's a bit of a gold bug and didn't have nice things to say about the Fed fiat currency. He's the type that would happily be asked and answer these types of questions.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:11:28
Give Airbitz a try. It's far easier and more familiar of a user experience. Designed for mainstream adoption, not failure. Keys are auto-encrypted and auto-backedup.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:50:08
Yes it is. But to be sure you can use this link to get to the correct listing on the app stores.

Yes, you're safe linking with Glidera. They are a trusted financial service that's fully compliant and regulated. I use them to buy/sell bitcoin all the time.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:31:04
They have probably spread their funds across many different exchanges such that a loss in bitfinex doesn't drastically affect their users. I've used them a good amount and been happy with the service.
@_date: 2016-04-18 14:55:41
For some people the Q &amp; A solution is still a better option than losing access to their account or writing down a password on a piece of paper. 
We do have a password recovery 2.0 feature that will reduce the complexity to just 2 simple questions and an email the user send themselves. Look for it in the next few releases. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 19:14:34
Airbitz just pushed out a major update yesterday with much improved speed, reliability, and cleaner UX. Also now has a referral program to let you earn Bitcoin for people you refer.

We're quite happy with Ramnode and server crate. Pretty reasonable prices especially for SSD and they do take Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:51:46
Airbitz supports sweeping mini private keys
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:11:43
Hi The security questions are entirely optional. You don't need them at all to setup an account and they are not asked when you first create an account. The app only suggests setting it up after you receive 100mB. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:37:33
Hi Ben,
We realize that the SDK is more restricted of open source, but consider this the equivalent of utilizing other third party server based APIs which are fully closed source, except that instead of using code on a 3rd party server, you're using code that runs in your app. Many apps use blockr.io, blockchain.info, blockcypher, at one point, chain.com. Airbitz is an option that provides some of that functionality but within your own app, not 100% relying on third party servers. Plus it also gives you Edge Security built right in for securing private keys and arbitrary data which other server side APIs can't do.
We are happy to open source the backend as well as there is no real 'secret sauce' in there. Just basic server databases that act like dummy storage for encrypted data. The client-side code by itself proves that there no real trust needed in the server infrastructure. Just give us some time to clean up the code, apply the licenses and push it out to public repos.
In addition we are considering a different license that allows for non-commercial modification and use.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-04-09 19:12:57
Give Airbitz a try. Very different from all the rest with a focus on UX and familiarity to most people. 
It's the only wallet with transaction tagging, recorded fiat value at time of transaction, simple acct creation with auto encryption, backup, and multidevice sync.
And now with an SDK to let you control your wallet from other apps. Let us know how you like it
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:00:11
Nope. It's still a decentralized wallet. You can export your private seed if you like. However, the private keys are generated on your device, encrypted with your username/password, then backed up on to Airbitz peer-to-peer storage nodes. 
The wallet is fully clientside in the sense that it directly accesses public bitcoin supernodes (Electrum/Libbitcoin) to do transactions.
Even if Airbitz servers were 100% down, you could still login with your username/password, which decrypts your accounts, and then send or receive bitcoin.
Airbitz is a finely tuned blend of decentralized, user-controller, privacy minded access to bitcoin while still giving the user experience of a mobile banking app. Note that we were rated the  Android wallet and  iOS Wallet for privacy by the OBPP. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:31:54
Correction. Airbitz does not support Segwit but Edge Wallet does although it is still in early beta. It also works on both iOS and Android. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:44:59
I think you'll find some powerful use cases for the SDK regardless of the established user base. It's the only platform that provides data encryption, backup, and synchronization in less than 3 lines of code. Perfect for crypto private keys, transaction metadata, personal info, etc.
ie. for iOS/Mac Objc
    // Create an account
    AirbitzCore *abc  = [[AirbitzCore alloc] init:
    gAccount = [abc createAccount: password: pin: delegate:self error:nil];
    // New account is auto logged in after creation
    // Use Airbitz Edge Security to write encrypted/backed up/synchronized data to the account
    [gAccount.dataStore dataWrite: withKey: withValue:
On second device
     // Log back in with full credentials
    gAccount = [abc passwordLogin: password: delegate:self error:nil];
    // Read back the data
    NSMutableString *usersEmail = [[NSMutableString alloc] init];
    [gAccount.dataStore dataRead: withKey: data:usersEmail];
However if you do build some cool apps on the SDK, we're happy to promote it to our current userbase, email list, social media following, and can even push notifications to our 50000+ mobile wallet accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:36:32
It is available as an early beta release that you can try out. You'll need to sign up for an invite at 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:45:24
We've thought about it but it's not on our roadmap yet. Due to the support of a multitude of currencies, it's difficult to let users pick a single exchange rate source, as it may not support the variety of currencies available.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:40:02
Only use the beta to test with small amounts. It is still an early release. Yes, Edge will allow you to export a private seed and the private seeds will be standard BIP44 and BIP49 for segwit. 
And yes you will still have your coins after the beta is over.
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:32:14
Correct but you get a far better user experience with it integrated inside edge. No need to login to Liberty X and no need to copy and paste addresses. Give it a try let us know what you think.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:39:10
This is not actually true. With Edge, keys are held on your device and even if our servers were down, you could simply login with biometric or your full password and extract your keys. You would even be able to send and receive funds since the app talks directly to the blockchain networks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:22:44
Airbitz fully supports CAD exchange rates. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:11:14
Airbitz is still fully supported and the company only rebranded to "Edge". Edge Wallet is a separate app that is currently available in beta but is separate from Airbitz and will not automatically upgrade on top of Airbitz. Once Edge Wallet is in production, you will be able to use it by just using your Airbitz login in Edge and your Bitcoin will show up there. In addition you'll have better support for other currencies like Ethereum, tokens, and Bitcoin forks such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:32:28
It’s still in beta but Edge Wallet supports segwit on iOS and Android. Also supports multiple other cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:32
Airbitz has rebranded to Edge and just released a new app, Edge Wallet, in public beta. It supports segwit on bitcoin and litecoin. 
The current Airbitz app is still supported but will not get an upgrade to segwit.

Don't ever pay full price at Starbucks again. The new Fold integration is making it dead simple.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:51:57
Mycelium isn't SPV to my knowledge and can only connect to their servers. They don't connect to full nodes directly. 
Electrum lets you launch your own Electrum server/node and connect to it.
Airbitz uses libbitcoin nodes and we'll soon be adding the ability for people to connect to their own libbitcoin server/nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-14 18:08:49
That's actually my preferred option! I'm there with you. I can make way better coffee (especially a good cappucino) at home. But when I'm travelling, with 10 mins between flights connecting at some random airport. Sometimes, Starbucks is all I've got. And for those moments, I now use Airbitz &amp; Fold :-)
@_date: 2015-12-03 04:46:48
Glad you enjoyed your experience with Airbitz. Let us know if you have any questions or feedback
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:28:50
I've tested Starbucks in the UK and it works fine at most locations. I never found one that didn't work although I've heard a few don't. Although the same is true in the US.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:19:33
Note that this is an unofficial, and unlicensed use of Fold's webapp. They are not using Fold's official API and there's no guarantee that this will continue to work. Nor would there be any guarantee of support from Fold from an unauthorized app.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:56:15
The account is really a username and password that encrypts your keys locally on your phone and gives you access to an encrypted backup on other devices. It doesn't work like a traditional "account". Only you have access to the keys and once the keys are on your device, you don't even need Airbitz servers to login into your device or send out funds. 
It's the easiest to use, yet still decentralized/private/autonomous wallet out there. In some ways even more decentralized than Mycelium since Airbitz doesn't require Airbitz servers in order for you to detect or send funds.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:59:23
I'm biased but of course like Airbitz as you do control your own keys, don't need to deal with encryption or backups (wallet does that for you) AND you can now buy/sell bitcoin from within the app in most US states and Canada.
It also now has integrated discounted gift card purchases through Fold. 20% off Starbucks at the swipe of a finger.

Airbitz uses a sliding scale for the mining fees and it ranges between .1 mBTC ($0.02) to .01mBTC ($.002) per kByte per transaction. The app targets a .1% mining fee of the amount you send with a minimum of .01 mB to a maximum of .1 mB per kByte. 
ie. 100mBTC ($25) gets the maximum fee of .1 mB per KB
10 mBTC ($2.5) gets the lowest fee of .01 mB per kB
This range fits within the range of fees used by BitcoinJ (.01mB) and most others (0.1mb) while offering lower mining fees for smaller value transactions. We felt that smaller transactions are likely less important to get confirmed quickly so the lower fee would be acceptable. This scaled fee also allows higher value transactions to get confirmed more quickly by using a larger fee.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:27:10
For now, you can only get the Target integration through Airbitz and you get a much smoother interface. Refunding your cards doesn't require copy and pasting a bitcoin addresses. Just tap the refund button. No QR codes to scan or bounce between your browser and wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:33:57
Although the cards are denominated in US Dollars, they should work fine at most UK Starbucks. Give it a try and let us know.

Similar but super beefed up. Encryption/password hashing runs in native C code, not javascript, so it's much stronger, harder to brute force passwords. There's no website to phish or man in the middle attack. App does certificate pinning on the client so SSL hacks can't fake the server. Bitcoin network access goes through public libbitcoin nodes/servers, not just Airbitz. ie. decentralized access to the network instead of one central company. Allows wallet to mostly function even if Airbitz is down.

@_date: 2014-10-19 17:48:30
Exactly. Chain.com does a good job but in the end they are providing a centralized service to a decentralized bitcoin network. Open source nodes like Libbitcoin/Obelisk are getting better, faster, and easier to use such that we can now access the bitcoin network directly. My company, Airbitz.co, uses Obelisk and this gives us the redundancy of accessing not just our own servers but also public servers such as those hosted by Dark Wallet, Coinkite, and Open Bazaar.

Trezor and other hardware, off line wallets exist because they are MORE sandboxed. It's not a hardline between sandboxed and not. There are many shades of grey just like security. No such thing as true cold storage since 'something' had to execute code to create that private key. It's simply a matter of how cold (secure) you want to be and balancing that with usability.

We realize that as a new company we still need to build the trust of the community, and we will do our best to achieve that. We are a real company with visible co-founders who are out in the community. Our entire team was present and hosted a booth at the Apr 2014 New York Inside Bitcoins conference and Toronto Bitcoin Expo. We've also hosted a booth at the London conference in Sep and our whole team of 10 ppl were present at the Las Vegas conference for our launch two weeks ago. 
We've worked closely with Amir Taaki and the Dark Wallet team on the Libbitcoin project and contributed significant code to that project. Two of our co-founders, William Swanson and Damian Cutillo, were part of the Dark Market hackathon project which has now spawned into Open Bazaar.
I've given numerous talks at various meetups here in San Diego including at UCSD and Qualcomm, as well speaking at conferences such as the Inside Bitcoins London conference, Vegas conference, Cryptolina, and strongly represented Bitcoin at the IMTC (International Money Transfer Conference) surrounded by a bunch of legacy money transmission companies. Our code will also go open source at the end of this month / early next month.
If you want to meet me in person, I will be talking at the following events:
Tue 10/21 - Silicon Valley Bitcoin meetup
Tue 10/28 - San Francisco Meetup
Mon 11/17 - Seattle Meetup 
and will also be attending the following conferences:

I simply don't recommend a web wallet. Website interfaces are incredibly difficult to secure with phishing attacks, MITM attacks, rogue plugins, etc rampant on many systems. 
Airbitz and Pheeva give you similar functionality to a web wallet (login &amp; password is usable on multiple mobile devices) but without the major security issues of browsers since they only run on mobile. 
Pheeva however is closed source and single address but still decent.

Any app cannot just steal your coins. They need to be given access to the environment of your wallet which isn't that easy. Replacement keyboards are given access, and so are apps running on jailbroken or rooted phones. iPhones have pretty damn good sandboxing to keep apps from interfering with each other (except for those kb replacements which they enabled in iOS 8)

Here's a few places you can hit up:
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:42:38
The reason why people have given bitcoin value is the ease of owning digital money with no counterparty risk. The ease of transferring the value in seconds with very low fees
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:06:59
Note that Airbitz now has RFC6979 deterministic signatures to help prevent RNG attacks.

Check out humble bundle. 
Also, since newegg and tigerdirect take bitcoin, you can get any games they sell with BTC. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:22:18
For the most ease-of-use functionality and security you'll find in a mobile wallet, you can't beat Airbitz. 
- User owned private keys
- Multiple HD wallets per account with user specified names
- Super strong Scrypt password key stretching
- Pay via Bluetooth BLE instead of QR code
- Payee, Category, and Notes tagging per transaction
- Transaction history search of above terms
- Auto complete payee info from address book or business directory
- Export of transaction history to CSV
- Multi device sync across android and iOS devices
- Send payment request via email or SMS
- Pay those email Sms requests with a single tap on link
- Easy transfer funds between wallets in one acct. no copy pasting addresses or scanning QR codes
- Drag and drop sorting or archiving of wallets
- Partial payment detection. Generates new QR code with remaining balance
Give it a try.

Personally I would stay away from web wallets in general. Too many possible security holes from phishing attacks, MITM attacks, rogue browser plugins, compromised server javascript, etc. I stick to native apps on desktop or mobile like Armory, Multibit, Airbitz, Mycelium, or BreadWallet and which are all open source and leave private keys 100% in your control. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 07:58:30
Totally agree. I mentioned this in my presentation at the Bitcoin Online Summit. This also applies for any wallet that holds your private keys as most keep a lot of funds offline. 
On another note, any wallet that requires a centralized server is also prone to not be able to spend your coins at a merchant when you need to even if you do own your keys. This applies to most multisig solutions right now, any web wallet, or wallets that require their own blockchain server. 
I won't mention names but many of us have experienced a well known web wallet constantly go down. Often right when I wanted to buy at a merchant. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:17:58
The key is to truly frequent these merchants to keep them trained on how to take BTC and realize it's value. Then help promote both bitcoin and the merchants by sending them some social media support. ie Twitter, Facebook, yelp. 
Although we only have coverage in 16 countries, the Airbitz directory (and wallet) is hand curated and we verify each listing with an email to make sure they do take bitcoin. We just launched in April, but we will be sending regular emails to merchants to double check that they accept BTC. 
You can use our directory on the web at  or on android and iOS. Head to  to download the mobile app. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:14:37
Note that multisig might still have this issue if it is the same company providing the random number generator and they introduced the bug into the code that generates enough of the keys to spend funds.
This is very applicable to Armory, Copay, and Greenaddress. Not sure yet how Coinkite and Coinb.in work but I would be surprised if their common use case is for the user to use a different company to generate their key.
The real key is proper testing before launching such significant and dangerous changes. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:04:14
Not necessarily. There are different levels of centralization. A multisig wallet where the provider holds one key as a cosigner on all your transactions is still centralizing all of your transactions to go through them vs directly to the bitcoin network. This gives up some privacy and reliability. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:40:08
Give the Airbitz Bitcoin directory a try next time. I don't believe there are any pizza places in Long Beach but we'll be adding them as soon as they come on board. 
Also check out our app on iOS and Android. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:16:39
Consider trying out the Airbitz wallet. Like Blockchain, you can access it from multiple mobile devices but it has a much friendlier UI and much richer ease of use functionality.
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:31:09
Desktop - Armory, very secure but not user friendly
Web - Green Address - make sure to backup
Mobile - Airbitz.co - Simplest to setup. Automatically backed up

Hi Insiderinformation.
Thanks for all the feedback and we've already put efforts into addressing most of your concerns.
For security reasons, we don't hold unencrypted data on the flash storage of the phone. iOS and Android will occasionally kill background applications thereby "logging out" the user.
In our next version, we've implemented server assisted PIN based re-login which will allow you to "re-login" to the app on a device that was logged into prior with a full login/password. We've carefully done this in a way that doesn't give up the security model we value. (a compromised device or compromized Airbitz servers will still have no access to user's funds).
This should alleviate that annoyance and we'll be adding touch-ID support for iOS to make it even easier.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:27:05
If you are ok with mobile-only (ios &amp; android). Check out Airbitz. We just implemented RFC6979 which is a major security feature that most wallets don't do. 
Our wallet is always encrypted, always backed up, and synced across all your devices with Airbitz installed and logged in. And you control your keys, not us.
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:18:31

Is that feature available for the single signature hot wallet? I find the multisig too cumbersome for regular spending but I'd rather not use the hot wallet feature if Coinkite is holding the priv keys which is the default. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:58:21
Being a small startup, we don't have resources to work on a port of Airbitz ( for Windows but for anyone interested, the code is entirely open source and 90% of it is in a C++ library which can compile under Windows so the GUI is all that's needed. Contact me if you'd like details.

Just because the nodes aren't in San Diego doesn't mean there's aren't people running nodes. Airbitz hosts several nodes using VPS providers and they won't show up as being in San Diego.
Also nodes is only one measure of adoption, and a poor one. Our merchant adoption is going amazingly well with quite a large number of merchants accepting bitcoin.

iOS applications have no ability to launch a "chooser" popup to select an app to handle the URI. This is entirely in iOS and it currently makes the decision on your behalf. We wish this was more like the behavior on Android but we don't have that level of control.

Slightly modifying the javascript on the server could compromise users' passwords thereby giving the attacker full access to funds.
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:21:35
I don't recommend Breadwallet as a POS, it doesn't clearly notify you when a payment comes in, nor does it let you specify an amount for the customer. Mycelium or Airbitz can do that. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:19:31
Yes agreed. But it's good to know a former federal official who was in the thick of the 2008 crisis sees the value too. With enough of them seeing the light, times WILL change, and change quickly

How about instead just send the basic info (business name and URL) to  and we'll add it to Airbitz for you. Far more user friendly to search with better listings details, and iOS/Android apps. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:31:01
Very good point. Note that Mycelium does not implement any encryption based on that PIN. It is strictly app behavior preventing access to funds. Someone with access to the storage of the phone could get the private keys.
You'd have to implement full device encryption to alleviate this.

Very cool. Do you know if that offline generator uses the same code as the generator they use for the other private keys?

I gave this talk in Queenstown, New Zealand late November at the Bitcoin South conference. I stick it right in the heart of these ‘legacy’ mobile payment providers and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Hope you enjoy the talk.
Topic Description:
The battle to dominate the mobile payments space has raged on for the past several years with major players such as Google, Square, Paypal, and now even Apple competing for a slice of a potentially massive pie. Learn how Bitcoin can revolutionize and capture the mobile payment industry in ways these big players can’t. We’ll take a look at the history of payments and see how bitcoin is actually similar to the most successful payment methods we have ever used.
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:19:08
The Airbitz wallet is auto-encrypted and auto-backed up. "Feels" like a hosted wallet but you actually own your keys. A login+password get you access to your funds on any iPhone/Android device
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:04:00
Just because you import your private key into a new wallet doesn't mean you can double spend the funds you just sent the merchant. That transaction is already in the blockchain even w/ 0 confirmations it will still take precedence over a double spend coming seconds later. Processors like Bitpay do propagation detection to help reduce chances of a dbl spend before they claim a payment is made.
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:27:16
Note that bitWallet is closed source, to the best of my knowledge. I wouldn't strongly trust a wallet that isn't open source. Might as well be a hosted wallet at that point.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:21:28
Definitely have to be careful when doing this with most wallets, especially if they generate new private keys. Only HD wallets generated from the same seed would be safe. Note that Airbitz already does the sync of private seed/keys between multiple devices automatically for you so you can use the same funds from two, three, whatever # of devices.
If you "import" meaning you sweep private keys into a new address, the funds will be gone from the original wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:19:58
Here are some tips to help make lives for merchants easier. I sent this to a merchant in San Diego after noticing customer/employee issues:
1. I'd highly recommend a large phone or small tablet for the merchant app. The staff gets confused when they have to scroll up and down to find buttons due to a small screen. And the QR code can be so small that some phones have trouble scanning it. 
2. Get a phone/tablet such as a Samsung which has a physical home button which can turn on the screen. Staff can take quite some time just to find the ON button on the sides of most Androids.
3. Turn off the screen lock. For many people, swiping to unlock the screen is not so intuitive. Some staff try to tap the swipe button unsuccessfully unlocking the screen.
4. Wipe out the home screen of all icons other than the Coinbase/Bitpay (or whatever they use) app. That way there is no question as to what they need to tap to launch the program. Coinbase also has a kiosk mode whereby it is the only application running and can't be easily shut down.
5. If they are using a credit card swiping machine that's separate from the POS, consider moving to using that same tablet/phone for CC transactions via Square (or any other mobile CC processor). This makes the device very readily available since staff uses it regularly. Normally they are hunting down the phone since they rarely ever use it. By using it for all digital transactions, it is always fresh in their minds and always available. It will also help unclutter the point-of-sale area by reducing the number of devices. It also looks a lot cooler than a conventional credit card machine. My wife did this for her dental practice and is quite happy with it. Here's what she uses
6. Use an app specifically designed for merchants. ie. Coinbase merchant, Bitpay, etc. Regular wallets do not always allow you to enter the $USD amount but instead require a BTC amount thereby requiring the employee to figure out the conversion.

I was interviewed by Kevin Cruz of Bitcoin Magazine. I spill the details of Airbitz: our business directory, upcoming wallet, and core values and why we're convinced Bitcoin needs our focus on ease of use and ease of security.
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:32:21
At minimum, use a wallet with changing addresses such that every transaction is a new address. Airbitz, Mycelium, Breadwallet and many others (except Blockchain.info) do this. Spend the funds to yourself a couple times and you're decently mixed. If you're totally paranoid, then yeah, use a mixer.
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:57:02

This isn't necessarily true. If you use the blockchain API to send money, they decrypt your private keys on their server, not client-side. They don't store your funds but there is a window of server-side vulnerability.

Note that blockchain.info wallets have very weak password hashing. About just a 10 pass SHA. Unless you use a VERY complex password, brute forcing it is quite easy. 
On GPUs they could easily get billions of password brute force attempts per second.

Thanks for the kudos. 
Airbitz actually requires VERY little trust other than that we are actually compiling and shipping what we put in our open source github repo. But that's true of all mobile apps.
Our wallet doesn't actually *require* any central authority to send out funds. If Airbitz ceased to exist, you can still login to your wallet and send out your bitcoin. Logins function so long as you've logged into that device before. All it's doing is decrypting the data already on your phone. And sending of funds uses 3rd party bitcoin nodes in addition to ours.
Here's a test you can do. Login to your account once, then logout, then go to airplane mode, then log back in (full username/password, not PIN login). Notice you still get into your account. Can't really test actual sending in airplane mode, but you get the idea that the wallet is really all local on your phone. You can still export your master private key while in airplane mode, too.
Airbitz servers are just for backup of your pre-encrypted keys &amp; data and to sync them across devices. That's really it. We're almost like a mobile Multibit but with auto-encryption and auto-backup. We never see any of your private OR public addresses. Hope that alleviates your concerns. Let me know if you have other questions.
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:20:49

As a strong supporter of Bitcoin wallet transparency and security, Airbitz has released its Bitcoin Wallet and Map/Directory mobile app in open source. Airbitz source code is available to download from the following Github repositories:
Architectural documentation is coming soon. Utilizing the source code as-is will require API keys to Airbitz servers. API keys can be obtained by emailing developer
We strongly believe that full transparency, in key security components, is a must for Bitcoin wallets. Our entire client-side mobile app on both iOS and Android, including the wallet and business directory user interface, is now available in open source.
Our open source codebase includes the powerful Airbitz Core API/Library which implements nearly all of the Airbitz Wallet functionality including client-side encryption, user authentication, transaction signing, blockchain caching, backup, and device-to-device synchronization, all in a cross-platform, native C/C++ library already packaged for use on Android, iOS, and desktop. We welcome other projects looking to utilize this amazing platform for development of other Bitcoin applications.
Airbitz source code is released under a modified BSD license with full permission to use in open and closed source projects. Use of modified source code in commercial applications is allowed with written consent from Airbitz.

- BIP32 HD wallets
- Login + password on any iOS/Android device gets access to funds on multiple devices, simultaneously
- Scrypt password hashing for uber security
- Decentralized access to bitcoin network. Does not need Airbitz servers to Send/Receive
- Request via Bluetooth or NFC (in addition to QR codes)

The Airbitz wallet works great on Android &amp; ios and is built using a cross platform c++ "wallet core" library that runs on Linux just fine.

The problem you're having with Airbitz is likely due to your phone's clock being off by more than 1 min. The 2FA in Airbitz (like Google Authenticator) requires time between your phone and our server to be within 1 min of each other. Check your phone's clock against

Almost all mobile wallets register as handlers for the bitcoin: URIs. This is generally a feature and provides a better user experience for when users click on "bitcoin:" links in webpages and other apps. On android, you can choose which app you'd like to have handle these links upon initial click.

Don't be too nervous about the ability for Airbitz to restore all your transaction data. Everything is first encrypted with your credentials before even being stored on your phone. Then it's backed up and sync'ed to your other devices. It's a fully "zero-knowledge" app with a key focus on privacy.

I don't recommend printing a QR code and putting it at the register. This is the worst merchant and consumer experience possible. The consumer has to type in an amt to send and the merchant has to check if the amt sent is "close" to the correct amt using another app. 
Better to just use a mobile wallet. If you don't like bitpay or Coinbase, use Hive, Mycelium, Pheeva, or Airbitz. Airbitz even has a merchant mode that will detect partial payments and update the QR code to request the remaining balance. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:59:15
Give Airbitz a try. It implements a similar username/password style accounts system with full clientside encryption and auto backup. But Airbitz has no access to your keys or data. Zero knowledge platform but with th familiarity of just logging into a mobile app. It's also far more decentralized than Blockchain and lets users login and send/recovery money if Airbitz servers are down
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:12:32
Maybe rassah can chime in here but last time I checked, Mycelium couldn't have multiple accounts on one phone. I could only have one HD seed, and to utilize a different one, I had to reinstall the app and import the different seed. So if I wanted to share an "account" with someone else, say my wife or business partner, I'd have to reinstall the app to switch to that account. Maybe I just didn't find the option.

For the multi device functionality that Blockchain has, I'd recommend Airbitz instead. Yep, I'm biased as I co-founded Airbitz, but having HD addresses and 10x stronger encryption is nice. 
Give it a try and give us your feedback. We're always looking to improve. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 09:30:03
Depends on the wallet. Most require you to write down a 12-24 word seed on a piece of paper that you have to make sure you don't lose. I'd give Airbitz a try (disclaimer: I'm a co-founder). It gives you the familiar feel of a regular mobile app with a simple username/password account creation. Also has fast PIN or fingerprint relogin and password recovery. All your keys are encrypted on your device then backed up. You also have the option of super-easy 2FA to really harden your account security. And only you have access to your bitcoin. Unlike Coinbase, Airbitz staff does NOT have access to your keys. Only you do. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:02:10
Private keys are generated on the device, then encrypted with a strong hash of the user's username/password, then backed up to Airbitz servers. Nobody, including Airbitz, has the password to decrypt the private keys, other than the end user.
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:26:05
I'd recommend a more decentralized wallet. One that can work even if the wallet provider's servers are down (or they just don't have servers).  
Unfortunately, no web wallets can provide this. 
For a good mobile wallet, give Airbitz or Breadwallet a try. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:51:46
Simple and straightforward is a very subjective thing. For some, Breadwallet is very straight forward. For others used to a mobile banking type of app, it might not be. We've designed it to be the most familiar and friendly to setup while still providing super high decentralization, and privacy. Check out Airbitz and let us know what you and your friend think. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:35:06
The server model provides zero knowledge encrypted backups. All data including private keys and all transaction meta data is encrypted locally on device before being backed up. And only the user has the keys to decrypt (their username and password). If you at all feel concerned by this then simply use a random 12 word password, much like other wallet backup phrases, and that would be impossible to brute force making your data impenetrable on our servers. But make sure to write down that password and keep it safe. 
You can also enable 2FA which will protect you against an attacker who might have gained access to your password
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:08:20
Airbitz does the following that to the best of my knowledge, Mycelium doesn't:
1. Automatically encrypt and backup the private keys for the user. No written down passphrase is needed. Only a username/password. For users new to bitcoin, private key backup is one of the biggest causes of bitcoin loss. 
2. Provides password recovery capability but designed such that Airbitz still has no access to the private keys.
3. Encrypts the private keys before saving them on the device. Protects against malware that simply swipes your device storage.
4. Allows users to tag their transactions with meta-data. ie. payee, category, fiat value, and notes which are all client-side encrypted and backed up for full privacy
5. Send payment requests via email/sms which are auto-tagged when payment is received. ie. Send bob a public address via email. When he pays that address, the transaction shows in the wallet as coming from "bob
6. Export transactions to CSV or QBO (Quickbooks format)
7. Full functionality across iOS and Android and ability to sync account across devices with just username/password
8. Optional fingerprint login on iOS and Android instead of PIN
9. Utilizes public bitcoin nodes to query and send transactions vs only Mycelium servers

It is mobile only for now although the core wallet code is cross platform. Location is only for the integrated business directory which also helps you tag transactions after you spend. All info is local, client side encrypted though with a high level of privacy. Neither Airbitz nor any third parties know anything about your transaction info.

I won't claim it's the best but our wallet Airbitz has received amazing reviews from the community.

True. A good programmer can sling code in any language. There, however, is a huge value in understanding what your language is doing underneath all the abstraction layers to help write *more* optimal code. Lower level languages like C/C++ make that clear which is why they are so often used as educational foundations before moving to higher level languages like Python.
Either way. If you're starting off, just start coding. Code often. Even make shitty code. But learn from mistakes, have an open mind, and have fun.

Airbitz is fully functional to send and receive funds even if Airbitz servers are down. You can login using your password on any device that's been previously logged into before. Once logged in, Airbitz uses public electrum and stratum nodes to query and send transactions. See this FAQ

The server provides backup for the private keys and transaction meta data such as payee, category, and notes (the exact thing you'll want to export). It also allows for secure but fast PIN login, password recovery, synchronization of keys and data between devices, single sign on for our partner apps, and a host of other useful functionality. We believe the key isn't to eliminate the server, it's to put little or no trust in it and make it less critical to the core functionality of the app. But if you are compromising usability and functionality in the name of "eliminate the server" then we fundamentally think that's an incorrect direction to go.

Tap the buy/sell button in Airbitz. Then continue to create an account with Glidera inside the app. Once verified (could take a few days), you can buy/sell bitcoin right from within Airbitz

In Airbitz, go to Request and then tap Copy. This will copy your address the the clipboard. Then go into the Coinbase app and choose to send out your money. You can then paste this into the address field in Coinbase. Choose your amount and send. This will then get received into Airbitz.

Thanks for that reminder. So many things I forget sometimes. Overall I'd say the two are very different products designed for different markets. Many people would agree that Mycelium is a power user tool with advanced features. The aim of Airbitz is make crypto as familiar as possible to the mass market, with functionality that makes it feel like a regular mobile wallet while still proving privacy and full control of bitcoin.

If you're only looking to store small amounts for purchases, then definitely go with a mobile wallet. It's a cinch to scan QR codes from your computer using your phone. And if you purchase something while on your phone or in a store, your wallet is ready to go as well. Desktop wallets are pretty inconvenient for anything but online purchases while on a desktop. Some good open source mobile wallets:
* Airbitz 
* Breadwallet 
* Greenaddress 
* Hive 
* Mycelium
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:15:56
Airbitz and Bitwage both support the Request for Payment Address protocol 
This allows a website to request an address from a wallet via a button or QR code. The wallet can service that request by scanning the QR code or servicing a URI link from a button. The wallet then sends an address back to the website via a return URL. This prevents the awkward user experience of having to copy an address from your wallet and pasting it into an email to yourself on the desktop to then copy and paste it into a website.

It would be great if a third party would push out a comprehensive review of the top 10 wallets. I feel like it's been over a year and the landscape has changed a lot. 
I generally stick with autonomous wallets vs hosted wallets. I want to control my private keys so Circle and Coinbase I only use for buy/sell. Xapo I don't use at all. 
For cold storage I go with Armory but I'm evaluating a few other easier options like Ledger Wallet. 
For a spending wallet I of course use Airbitz (co founder) but before that I used Mycelium and Blockchain. Both were great for the time but I wanted more functionality for me and ease of use 
for the people I introduce into Bitcoin. 
Whatever you use, make sure it is at least
1. Open Source
2. Rolling/changing Addresses
3. Client side encrypted
And make sure either you or the wallet platform back up the keys.

Just to clarify. Airbitz refers to an account as a single username/password. Each account can have multiple wallets. Each wallet is a separate HD master seed. There is no connection between wallets nor between accounts. They are cryptographically separate keys. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:50:15
It would be nice if wallets would support scanning an http URL QR code which would forward them to a bitcoin: URI with the actual address. That way you could change the address at will. In the meantime you are kinda stuck with the same address and there's no real future proof way to deal with it. 
If you do embed an http URL for now, most anyone with a generic QR code scanner on their phone can use that and it will launch their wallet. They just wouldn't be able to scan it with their wallet directly although we are looking to add this to the Airbitz wallet
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:16:10
Great question and a tough one for people to evaluate. One thing to look for is an open source implementation so that if anything happens to the company, you know someone *can* extract out the necessary code to reclaim your funds from the keys. 
Coinkite isn't open source and I don't believe either Coinb.in is either although that's just first glance.
I use Armory, although I admit it's crazy complex. Copay is open source and a significant improvement but still in beta.

Airbitz does exactly that. Account will not allow user to receive funds unless it has been encrypted and backed up  
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:58:51
Correction on  Airbitz can handle multiple accounts and wallets on one device. Mycelium can handle multiple wallets from the same HD seed, but you couldn't switch to a new account (with different seeds) on the same phone. ie. On Airbitz, I have one account for personal use with my personal wallets. I frequently switch to a business account with multiple business wallets.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:33:38
If you don't want to deal with the complexities of a hardware wallet, I would suggest keeping your funds on a mobile device, especially iOS devices. Mobile devices are arguably the most secure devices that the average person owns. Apps are well sandboxed from each other and the app stores filter out a good amount of malware. Just make sure your device isn't jailbroken.

Challenge with paper wallets is that you need not just security against theft, but also against loss or destruction. That means you need multiple copies. And if you EVER need to spend from them, then it's re print a new wallet &amp; place in deposit box again and whereever you have copies.
Although it requires an IT dept and an extra computer, Armory is what i'd consider ideal cold storage.
Stupid strong private key encryption on offline computer. M of N key splitting for the backups which need no password. Print 5 splits of a key and place them around town. You need 3 of 5 to recover. Damage or theft to any 2 is ok. And offline computer can sign transactions without compromising private key.

Airbitz has no fear of venturing into the Dark. We aim to make privacy features not just easy, but invisible. ALL users should be using great privacy features whether they care or not. Only then will those of us that see the value gain the privacy we want. 
I'm proud that Airbitz has and will continue to utilize and support the libbitcoin/obelisk project which Dark Wallet is built on. In that manner, we contribute to and also take advantage of great privacy features put into the foundation of this project.

Airbitz isn't really an online wallet. The entire wallet functionality runs from within your phone including all encryption of your private keys. Encrypted private keys are then backed up to peer to peer servers. In some ways security is actually stronger than mycelium since your private keys are encrypted even before they are stored on your phone. Private keys are not encrypted at all on mycelium. 
Even without Airbitz the company, your wallet can still login and send out money. Here's a little test. Login to your account. Now enable airplane mode then logout and log back in (full login, not PIN login). Notice servers aren't needed to login. That's because Airbitz isn't an "online" wallet. 
Also, Airbitz accesses open source, public, libbitcoin nodes to access the Bitcoin network. Mycelium can only use their own proprietary server for network access.

Try Airbitz. No need to backup or encrypt your private keys. It's all done for you in the background and sync'ed between your devices. This will give you the most familiar experience to Coinbase/Circle but with you having full control of your keys. Not to mention the ability to tag your transactions, buy/sell in-app with a linked back account (like Coinbase), buy discounted gift cards in-app. And it's rated  Android wallet and  iOS wallet for privacy by the OBPP. Give it a try and let us know what you think.
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:27:42
Airbitz has no sending limit since it is fully user controlled. You own and control the private keys so no limits can be enforced. 
But like Coinbase and Circle you can still buy Bitcoin from within the app by linking a bank account. Once Bitcoin is purchased, it's stored in private keys you control. It's never held by a third party custodian that could enforce spending limits. Give it a try.

Full drive encryption is a plus, but more importantly the wallet should encrypt your keys before storage on the drive. I think this is optional w/Electrum meaning your keys are temporarily stored unencrypted on the drive. Encrypt them right away as soon as the wallet is created.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:26:16
Also, to answer your question, Airbitz is an HD wallet and changes addresses with every transaction. Each wallet in your "account" has a master private seed which it uses to create all addresses for that wallet. All this happens automatically without any extra effort. If you explicitly want a fully separate wallet with separate keys, just create a new wallet within your account. Hope this helps clarify things. Feel free to ask if you have other questions. Here's a link to more info

As a point of reference, Airbitz will look forward 10 addresses on each wallet (wallets are inside accounts) and you can have unlimited wallets although things will slow down a lot over 5 wallets. You can login to multiple devices with the same login/password and each device will know about all the transactions that have occurred on every other device regardless of the address skipping.

Airbitz is usable without syncing the blockchain or using centralized services. It connects to open source, public, bitcoin nodes running Libbitcoin/Obelisk.

@_date: 2015-01-26 04:37:13
I'm biased towards Airbitz of course but I'll try to give an objective response.
Breadwallet is fine if you want a bare bones wallet and you want to deal with the backup yourself. Most people are not accustomed to the "write down this passphrase and keep it safe" part of many wallets. 
BitWallet is not open source and I don't believe in closed source wallets. 
Blockchain.info is a long time, mostly trusted player, but does not have auto changing HD addresses (poor privacy) and has relatively weak encryption (SHA password hashing). 
Mycelium was my favorite until I found out that there was no encryption for my private keys on my phone.
I exclusively use Airbitz on my phone. So much simpler to setup and secure than any other wallet, but I'll be honest with it's short comings.
1. The encryption strength (Scrypt password hashing) slows down the app a bit. Logins takes longer than most apps. 
2. Since Airbitz keeps all keys and transaction metadata encrypted client side and auto-synchronized with peer-to-peer servers, wallets with a ton of transactions can be a bit sluggish. We're improving this significantly as I speak.
3. There's no 2FA option, yet. But we're implementing that now and it will be the EASIEST 2FA you've ever used.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:17:40
Also, you might just be able to ask Coinkite and Coinb.in for the actual multisig script. Not sure how'd you'd test it if you're not a developer, but if you can, that can be your backup if anything happens. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:40:21
Airbitz should be about instant and usually less than 10 seconds. Times when we've seen issues are when users are connected to some wifi hotspots that block the type of traffic needed to connect to bitcoin nodes. Airbitz specifically connects to Electrum and Libbitcoin nodes. Usually switching from wifi to cellular or vice versa fixes the problem. We ourselves have never ran into a wifi or cellular that specifically causes this problem so it is hard for us to troubleshoot but users almost always have it resolved by making that quick switch.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:16:47
It will be buy/sell like the way Coinbase/Circle work. But without your bitcoins being held by a third party. REAL bitcoin get sent directly to your Airbitz wallet which you control the private keys for. 
And we'll quickly be offering this in multiple countries as we don't do the buy/sell but rather our exchange partners. Like the Uber of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:31:13
Take a chill pill, for Pete's sake. I didn't even mention our wallet. I gave pretty objective advice and if you read enough, you'll notice I even suggest reach out to you guys for the redeem script. Airbitz is a mobile hot wallet, not a large fund multisig or cold wallet. We're looking for a good solution ourselves and I'm just sharing my experiences. I would have liked to consider and recommend Coinkite's multisig if it weren't for such animosity.

I wouldn't recommend any web wallets as there are a ton of attack vectors against websites. For blockchain, either don't touch their website and only use them via their mobile app or don't use them at all. I'd recommend either a native mobile or desktop app. Mobile devices tend to have FAR less malware so that to me is my first choice for a wallet platform. For more security, I go to offline desktop wallets. 
I always recommend people look for the following things in wallet software:
1. Open source code (even if you can't audit it yourself, the transparency helps keep the developers in check)
2. Own your own private keys. Hosted wallets have historically been a danger.
3. Private keys encrypted WITH YOUR PASSWORD so a compromised system doesn't necessarily get to your funds. Look for those that do strong, GPU resistant password derivation (key stretching)
4. Easily backed up keys.
5. For extra security, multisig but make sure to use it correctly. Multisig by itself isn't more secure unless keys are properly distributed between multiple parties
On desktop, I use Armory and have heard good things about mSigna. Both do multisig and are advanced wallets for large fund storage. Electrum is a bit easier but you have to make sure to encrypt and backup your wallet.
On mobile, I use Airbitz (strong bias as I'm a co-founder), but i've also used Mycelium (note that it has NO encryption) but has good power user features. ie. spend from paper wallet

Trust is a vague term. There will always be some level of trust, even if it means trusting that the wallet developer didn't maliciously modify their code before publishing the app. WRT to trusting servers, in Airbitz's case, you aren't trusting the servers. They don't have access to your private keys... only to encrypted data. If you are paranoid, then use 12 random words as your password and then write those down. You increase your risk of losing your password (the much much more common way people lose bitcoin), but you make your account immune to any attack on our servers and thereby eliminating any 'trust' factors.

Passwords are inherently weaker but that is compensated by the fact that password entry can be severely rate limited by our servers and the password can be very strongly hashed to inhibit brute force attempts in case an attacker gets a hold of the encrypted data.

Hive is no longer supported to the best of my knowledge. Best to pull out your private seed and sweep the funds into another wallet. Most out there won't require you to jump through the hoops you mentioned with history and cookies.

Airbitz lets you buy up to $1500 a day and $7500 per month and has no sending limits since it's a fully user controlled wallet. You control the keys 100%. Give it a try and let us know what you think.

In talking to a couple of the LN devs, my understanding is that if LN gains enough market adoption, one could open a channel and keep it indefinitely open for a VERY VERY long time without closing it, all the while doing hundreds if not thousands of transactions without a mining fee. Don't get me wrong. This sounds AWESOME. So awesome though that there has to be a catch, and that catch is that it 'could' sufficiently decrease mining fee revenue. While there is a chance that the economy scales large enough, with enough channels opening/closing, to make up for the loss, I don't think anyone can definitely prove that. We've just never had such a type of digital economy like this. Hence why there aren't any good analogies. I don't pretend to know the actual affects of a system like LN, but I think it's premature to definitively say it will increase miner revenue in every way shape and form. I sure hope it does though.
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:31:26
Yes. You missed that the username and password are not the words used to generate the private key but they are rather the key to encrypt the data and authenticate to download your backup. Therefore they can 2 factored, server rate limited, and very strongly hashed to inhibit brute force attacks. And you don't have to enter it every time as Airbitz supports PIN login after first Logging into a device and touchID on iOS.

Hi there. For now, Target is exclusively available inside the Airbitz wallet. It's fully integrated so you can seamlessly buy both Starbucks and Target cards in just a couple taps. It also fully supports Starbucks refunds without having to copy and paste pub addresses to/from wallet and Fold website. And all transactions are auto tagged with gift card info so you'll know what you spent your Bitcoin on.

Try Airbitz. It works even if Airbitz the company goes down. It's auto encrypted and auto backed up onto p2p servers. It connects to free-open source nodes instead of proprietary, closed-source servers. And the app is open source as well.
Let us know what you think
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:29:33
Hence the reason why blockchain APIs that require third party servers shouldn't be used as much as possible. Access nodes directly with your own code. There are great SDKs to do just that. Libbitcoin for C++, BitCore for JS, BitcoinJ for Java, and soon Airbitz is launching ABC for iOS and Android. Keep your implementation decentralized and gain the full benefit Bitcoin has to offer. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:48:12
I use Airbitz for mobile  where I used to use Blockchain.info. It's data model is similar but it's not web-accessible.
For longer term, safer storage, I use Armory

This seems to also imply that miners will prefer the fork that generates them the most revenue from transaction fees. While I fundamentally hope for offchain scaling solutions like lightning, it effectively takes revenue from miners. If miners are whores then they will want to stay away from pimps that take their money.

May I (biased'ly) recommend a wallet doesn't require a "backup" process? Give Airbitz a try. A simple username/password on any iOS Or Android device and you're back into your funds. Still fully user controlled, fully encrypted and private ( Android and  iOS wallet for privacy by OBPP report)
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:52:38
Airbitz gives you the simplest interface for securing a hot wallet. No extra 12-24 word seed to backup, easy login across multiple devices. Fully client-side encrypted and user controlled keys. And it's rated the  cross platform mobile wallet for privacy by the OBPP
@_date: 2016-03-28 01:27:09
Not at this point, although our soon to be released SDK will allow someone to easily build either a Mac or Java based desktop app with just a bit of UI code as the SDK takes care of a LOT of the wallet code. If I might ask, what draws you to using a desktop app?
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:24:00
Private keys are generated on the device and are encrypted using a strong hash (and salt) of the user's username and password. The encrypted data is then backed up to Airbitz peer to peer servers. A user can authenticate using a new device with their same username and password which is hashed (with a different salt) to authenticate with our server to download the encrypted data. Add One-Touch 2FA to the account and even if an attacker knows the username and password of a user, they won't be able to authenticate with our servers to download the encrypted data. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:56:39
Airbitz is heavily researching the possibility of supporting both chains in the wallet. We are still assessing the work involved and how we would implement it. We'll let everyone know once we have something to announce.

Airbitz has buy/sell built in for US users through an integration with Glidera/Kraken.

Give Airbitz a try. Easier to use and setup than Blockchain and without all the verification headaches of coinbase. It's easily the most familiar, forgiving, and easy to secure user controlled wallet. Keys are auto encrypted and auto backed up with an option for password recovery. You won't find that in any other user controlled wallet.

Give Airbitz a try. It can sweep paper wallets into your mobile Airbitz wallet easily. 
It's also a very decentralized wallet providing strong privacy and redundancy. All while giving people the familiarity of mobile banking.

Yes you can simply spend the entire balance back to yourself and bump up the fee manually. Tap the fee amount at the confirmation screen (where you see the Slide to Confirm) and that will let you set a custom sat/byte fee. This will do a Child Pays for Parent. You'll need to pay a pretty high fee since you'll be paying for both transactions at once.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:00:24
Correct in that it is a balance of all forms of revenue. One cannot just discount mining fees completely and need to realize that it is a contributor to total revenue and it becomes more significant after every halving.

If you have already logged into Airbitz at least once, the keys are already on your phone. Your username and password (or TouchID on iOS) allow you to decrypt the keys. Even if Airbitz goes down, you can still login and send out your money. Airbitz is just an encrypted backup in case you lose your phone.

Not on the roadmap at this point. We're not comfortable enabling easy 0 confirmation double spends as a feature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:41:23
Agreed with that there is no 'best'. Beauty of bitcoin is that our choice of wallets are varied unlike the mostly identical banks.
I'm a co-founder of Airbitz so it's obviously my primary wallet. It's great if you like being able to tag transactions with meta-data, have multiple HD wallets in your account, easily "login" on multiple devices. But I also use Copay for multiuser-multisig support when sharing access to funds between multiple people. I've also used Armory for large fund storage (not easy to use though) and now hardware wallets as a replacement to that.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:14:13
Your backup was probably the weak point in this solution. If the backup was stored in email, which is the default by which Blockchain will send the backup, then someone with access to your email could attempt to bruteforce the backup. A strong password, as defined by blockchain might still be pretty weak. ie. "HowDoYouDoToday" is considered strong using their website, but that is a trivial password to break. Add the fact that the password is hashed using javascript using a client-side browser means that brute-forcing becomes much simpler.
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:21:24
Thanks for the kudos and good to know you're seeing 1%. We love BitID too and are trying to push more sites to use it.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:47:24
Airbitz is actually quite decentralized. It accesses a few dozen public electrum and libbitcoin nodes for validation. At the time the profile was made, the wallet only accessed Libbitcoin servers most of which Airbitz ran. Now it accesses Electrum servers as well, most of which Airbitz doesn't NOT operate. We will look to updating the Bitcoin.org profile soon to better reflect the decentralization status. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:37:48
Which wallet are you using? With Airbitz the fee should only be 1%. Each wallet integrated with Glidera has control over what fees they charge and we keep it at 1% in Airbitz.

Please give Airbitz a try and see what you think. Baked into the interface is the ability to tag all transactions with rich meta data like payee name, category, and notes. And as you requested, you can export all that info to CSV or a Quickbooks compatible QBO file. 
Plus, all the info is encrypted locally on your device so nobody can access it but you. Full zero-knowledge privacy.

Keep an eye out for the next Airbitz release 2.1.0 due out around next week. It will incorporate not only dynamic fees based on network averages but it will also tweak the fees based on the amount of Bitcoin sent. This will reduce fees for smaller value transactions to help micropayments while keeping solid fees for higher value transactions. 
On average, most transactions are averaging $.07 in fees in the app. Email info if you'd like to join the beta.
@_date: 2016-06-07 01:54:02
Send us a txid and we'd be happy to help. It's very possible the fee sent wasn't sufficient to get a fast confirmation. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:18:14
Thanks for the feedback. Technically speaking, Airbitz could support storing the decryption keys on your phone's keychain. Once you login you could always be logged in. Only on new devices would you need your password. Note that it would compromise security a little bit. Would this suffice for you? 
You can get part way there with Airbitz on iOS by setting Auto Logout to 60 days. So long as you launch the app within 60 days, it will use the keychain to log you in with no PIN, TouchId or password. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:25:34
Airbitz is probably the easiest to secure hot wallet on mobile. The app auto encrypts and backs up your keys and unlike Coinbase, only you have access to funds.

@_date: 2017-08-25 19:04:32
Paul here from Airbitz. We looked at this transaction and conditions of the network and found that the problem is due to fee estimates retrieved from 21.co.
As of Aug 25 11:42am PT, these are the fees reported by the fee estimating API at 
For a "High" fee, the Airbitz app chooses the "maxFee" value in the row of fees that has a minDelay and maxDelay of 0. This means there is high confidence that the transaction will confirm in the next block. Looking at the API output, 21.co is reporting this to be 28400 sat/byte which is why your transaction paid a huge fee. We've never seen such a discrepancy in the fee amounts like what we see above and are unsure why 21.co is reporting such a value. The Airbitz code has a hard coded "insanity cap" of 0.07 BTC so the fee will never exceed that amount. This is there just to catch any possible code logic bugs. The fee you experienced was just below that threshold.
To anyone using any wallet, please always verify the fee you are about to send before sending the transaction. With the way the bitcoin network operates, we are seeing fees skyrocket in the blink of an eye. We've contacted 21.co to let them know about the issue to hopefully get it resolved.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:48:21
You can link a bank account directly from Airbitz. No need to buy with Coinbase and then transfer to a wallet. Rates are cheaper too. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:08:06
Not sure how well it's being updated, but if development is slowing down, I'd recommend migrating to Electrum or Multibit as desktop alternatives.
If you're using the strong multisig offline signature capabilities, then consider Cyphrex. It's developed by Eric Lombrozo who's a well trusted Bitcoin Core dev.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:34:11
We hope so too hence why we've reached out to 21 to hopefully get this understood and resolved.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:47:44
Depends how you define safe. For the average user, I'd say Airbitz as it protects them not just against device hacking but also against their own negligence of having to backup keys and secure their paper backups.
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:21:04
Private key generation is based on cryptographically secure random numbers. 
A strong, GPU resistant hash of the username/password is used to encrypt/decrypt the private keys and other account data. A different hash is also used to authenticate with servers to download backups of the data. 
We also agree that passwords are a pain. But we feel the biggest pain is having many different passwords. That's why Airbitz also supports and promotes BitID and similar tech. This allows users to have one strong password that can authenticate to multiple services utilizing public/private key technology.  
Asking users to write down 12-24 words FOR EACH app they use is arguably even worse than passwords. That's been the pain point we've heard from users and have addresses this with our architecture
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:02:29
Haha. Mine is at 982.12. Been awhile.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:16:15
If you have already logged into Airbitz at least once, the keys are already on your phone. Your username and password (or TouchID on iOS) allow you to decrypt the keys. Even if Airbitz goes down, you can still login and send out your money. Airbitz is just an encrypted backup in case you lose your phone.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:30:49
Give Airbitz a try. Great combo of easy of use, high security, and familiar/forgiving interface for securing bitcoin vs the cryptic key management that most other wallets require. And you still have 100% control of your funds with no 3rd party custodian.
Make sure to enable 2FA for added security. It's just a push of a button in Airbitz and doesn't require any 3rd party apps or SMS/Email.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:06:31
Also, paper wallets are only as secure as you are able to make them with your own physical security without also losing them. Far more bitcoin is lost from people losing them in cold storage offline hard drives and paper wallets than from phones getting hacked. 
If you want vault like security in Airbitz, enable 2FA, use a good strong password, disable PIN and fingerprint login, then you'll have a super secure wallet that's still more usable then paper. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:05:07
Not full SPV but Airbitz uses public Electrum nodes of which some are run by Airbitz (about 2) but most are public over 30+. The wallet can always send and receive using public nodes even if Airbitz servers are down.

Airbitz supports detecting RBF transactions but does not allow sending them.
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:37:36
Install Airbitz and you've got buy/sell build into a wallet where you control the keys with super easy security. Make sure to enable 2FA. For uncomfortable large amounts, KeepKey, Trezor, and Ledger are good hardware wallet options but practice with small amounts first to make sure you know how to use them. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:06:42
Airbitz is on Android and let's you buy and sell in app. Also does auto encryption, auto backup and sync between devices. You fully control the keys. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:39:09
Private keys in Jaxx and Mycelium are unencrypted on your device. 
With Airbitz they are encrypted with a strong hash of your username and password. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:44:07
Yes and no. Airbitz auto backs up your keys so if you lose your phone, you can still access your funds. Also, your phone is a backup of Airbitz. If Airbitz completely goes away, you can still decrypt the keys on your device using your password and either export the keys at that time or even just send out your funds as normal since the wallet directly talks to the decentralized network and doesn't require Airbitz servers to send money.
If you do decide backup your keys to paper, you put yourself at risk of screen capture malware seeing your keys as well as actual theft of the paper backup so make sure that piece of paper is in a physically secure place.
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:48:33
Enable 2FA and make sure you have a strong password and you're quite very secure. If you choose to go with a hardware wallet then the frequently underestimated challenge is securing your backup. Make sure it is out of other people's reach but that you also won't lose it. That hardware may be nearly impenetrable, but many people are careless with the written backup, either making it quite accessible to thieves or easily misplaced. Second to exchanges getting hacked, the biggest reason people lose bitcoin is due to losing their keys. 
Note that you do not need to backup your private key with Airbitz. Keys are auto backed up so long as you have and remember your password. Having a second backup is just another point of access and a potential attack vector. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:36:27
This is not necessarily true. All three wallets require the user to backup their private key by showing them a pass phrase to write down. Should the user have a screen grabber malware, the bitcoin would be compromised. Same would be true for a keylogger while they are entering their private key on a new device. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:15:29
This app doesn't appear to secure private keys the same way as Airbitz. From what I can gather, it is a fully hosted solution like Circle or Coinbase where they fully control your private keys.

In all fairness, has a point. All software you use requires some trust in the developers. Unless you intend to audit every line of code yourself, you'd have to trust that the software does what the devs say it will do. But there is no wallet where this isn't the case. 
To help minimize that trust, it's recommended to use a wallet that's open source, mature code that has been around for years with no decernable problems and from a public facing team 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:46:04
Totally fair. While I have a large amount of funds in Airbitz, we also incorporate multisig wallets for security for larger stores of wealth. I'd sooner recommend multisig as a solution for higher levels of security than offline paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-01-04 05:23:54
Airbitz is the only wallet of the wallets mentioned that actually keeps your keys encrypted on disk with a pass phrase that only you know. And with the addition of 2FA, it protects you against keyloggers and screen capture malware. Both of which are THE most common types of malware you have a chance of getting. If your wallet shows you a private key on screen it or has you type it in, then these types of malware can steal your funds. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:49:27
The 12 word backup phrase IS the private key. It's actually all the private keys in one. What is the the backup phrase encrypted with? From what I recall, it is not encrypted with a user generated key/password but a static value encoded in the app. This is trivially extracted as seen in this blog post
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:11:57
Even better. Install Airbitz. Link your bank within the Glidera/Kraken plugin. Buy bitcoin and it's automatically sent to your Airbitz wallet that you fully control. No need to transfer between exchange and wallet.

Hi Doug. This is independent of Airbitz edge-security. Really, BitID and other private key authentication schemes use digital signatures to authenticate the user. Edge Security is what secures the private key for the user regardless of what the private key is for.

Look more carefully and you'll realize Airbitz gives the user full control of their bitcoin. Client side encrypted, zero knowledge security is NOT "giving someone else control of your money"

That one login is used to encrypt the keys on your device as well as back them up to p2p servers. If you lose your device, the credentials can redownload the encrypted keys and decrypt them locally. 
Since Airbitz never sees your credentials, we can't get to your keys.

Should be worth mentioning that in the US people can use both wallets to purchase bitcoin in-app in 49 states. No need to go to the local or online options. 
Also, with Airbitz, the PIN by itself doesn't protect against a lost phone. User's secure and backup their wallet by simply setting a strong password. It's also recommended to enable 2FA.

Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of Airbitz. But let me describe our fundamental theory behind security:
No security solution is perfect and security cannot be defined on a linear scale. There are always compromises in one direction or another. We design Airbitz by considering what are the biggest causes of Bitcoin loss.
1. By far the biggest cause: Hacks on centralized wallets &amp; exchanges
2. A close second: People losing bitcoin from not backing up keys or losing an encryption password
3. And a distant 3rd: Actual devices getting hacked via malware or entry via internet connection
Most suggestions on these forums point people to what are considered the "most secure" solutions which try to protect against  above. ie. paper wallets, offline computers, cold storage, hardware wallets. But with their intimidating backup and security process, many people roll the dice and just hold a vast majority of crypto on exchanges and hosted wallets... causing problem  Those that decide to try and manage keys themselves using the recommended "super secure" solutions then fall into 
At Airbitz, we try to build the strongest solution against device attacks ( while making the user experience as familiar as possible to not alienate users away towards centralized wallets ( and also making the security as forgiving to user error as possible to prevent 
With that said. I think there will always be a place for the uber secure solutions like cold-storage, multi-sig, offline, hardware wallet combos. But they will likely be for the enterprise users, IT managers for companies like exchanges, hedge funds, or even businesses that transact in crypto. They can and should dedicate the resources to learning how to properly secure funds that are touched by multiple people and affect multiple people (see the C4 certifications). But for the 90% average consumer, I predict that our own computing devices will become more and more secure and capable of securing a larger amount of wealth via better app sandboxing and hardware secured storage, and software wallets like Airbitz can become the defacto standard for the general population.

This problem has been mentioned numerous times over the past several months. If this is critically affecting your ability to use bitcoin I'd recommend switching to another wallet until they are able to resolve the problem. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:38:12
I would agree. We support BitID in Airbitz and there is no reason why it can't be used for general public/private key authentication that has nothing to do with bitcoin functionality
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:55:53
It does but in an indirect way. 
Here are the steps for a transaction that you sent
1. Check that there are two output addresses. Tap on the transaction -&gt; Advanced. Look at destination and see if there are two addresses in the destination. If so, good.
2. Go to Request. Tap Copy
3. Go to Send. Tap Address then paste the address. Verify it's the same address from Request
4. Tap Max
5. Tap 'bits' blue text next to the fee. Choose "High" fee.
6. Send the transaction.
This might cost quite a lot in mining fees as it will spend your entire wallet balance back to yourself.
If this was a transaction of incoming funds, just start from step 2.

As a slight clarification, the username and password are hashed and that is used to encrypt your private keys and then back them up. Airbitz doesn't directly derive your keys from the username and password as that would be insecure. I would recommend enabling 2FA for added protection. In addition, you can also enable password recovery in case you lose or forget your password. In all cases, Airbitz never has access to your funds.

Admittedly the bitcoin payment option isn't ideal for US residents as ACH is much cheaper. However for international investors, which are fully allowed under Title III, the only option prior to Bitcoin was a wire transfer which could cost $30-40. For a $300 investment, that's 10%+. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:14:48
Give Airbitz a try. Even though there is a signup process, you'll notice there is no email or phone number. The credentials turn into an encryption key to secure your private keys and back them up. You have full control of your funds and Airbitz can't access them, but with the simplicity of a normal mobile app. You might even like the design :)
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:01:11

Hardware wallets require similar trust as a paper wallet. They still have source code that can be malicious. I guess one could argue that hardware wallets require more trust because you can't audit the code once it's embedded in the hardware. You really have to trust that the hardware is running the intended code.
I do think in the future, 3rd party audits of wallet software will be the norm. They are just very expensive at this point and hence open source gives the transparency needed to help alleviate trust issues. But in addition to the source code being audited, the entire process of deploying the code into hardware or production software is worth random audits to prevent sneaking in of malicious code. As the industry matures and a few key players arise, this will become pretty standard I'm sure
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:53:08
Why would you want the user to authenticate with an existing key? Ideally private keys should only be generated by the user. I'm not sure what your implementation looks like but a generally good idea is to let users generate a key on their device and simply register the pub key with what whatever service needs to know their identity.
@_date: 2016-12-10 07:30:22
Airbitz has been built to not rely on Airbitz servers for Bitcoin transactions or even just logging into the user's device. Use a full password or fingerprint and you can login even if Airbitz servers are down (on any previously logged in device). 
This has allowed us to have 100% uptime since we rely far less on any servers but instead keep keys on the user's local device and directly access the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:02:32
No, Airbitz doesn't have access to your account. The username and password, which only you know, are used to encrypt and backup your data and private keys. No one has access to them but you. At the same time you don't need to backup the keys yourself as they are already backed up. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:14:56
As much as people may hate Apple in the bitcoin world, their products seem to be the lesser of multiple evils. They design their own chips for mobile so any backdoor in Intel or AMD chips wouldn't necessarily be in Apple devices. They've publicly defended consumer privacy and security against the government and the government has outwardly hated them for it. For the average consumer, a simple iPhone with a good mobile wallet utilizing encrypted storage of keys is likely your best bet. Just don't install any custom keyboards. 
@_date: 2016-11-04 21:03:58
To address your concerns:
1. Regarding the concern of Airbitz being compromised and issuing an update that could destroy keys. This isn't any different than any other wallet or dapp issuing an update that could simply spend all the funds. This basic trust exists in most all wallet software. 
2. Cryptolocking our servers would not detrimentally affect our users as the keys also exist on the device and users can always decrypt their keys locally even without airbitz servers. In addition, data is revision controlled locally on the device so cryptolocked data on our servers couldn't overwrite data on the phone. We can always rollback the local data to a good, non-cryptolocked version. 
3. The case of Airbitz getting shutdown AND a user losing their phone, we would consider to be an extremely rare, blue moon occurrence. It takes less than $50/mon to host the server infrastructure needed to make sure people are able to remove their funds should Airbitz go out of business. Unless you consider us to be a malicious company, it is in our very best interest to notify users of the need to transfer out their funds should we go out of business. And if we were a malicious company, a malicious update to the app would be far more profitable than just shutting down servers with no notification. And once again, any wallet app could do that. 
No security solution is perfect and security cannot be defined on a linear scale. We design Airbitz by considering what are the biggest cause of Bitcoin loss. 
1. Hacks on centralized wallets &amp; exchanges 
2. People losing bitcoin from not backing up keys or losing an encryption password
The concerns you have above aren't even on the radar as a cause of Bitcoin loss. 
Why not promote a solution that tries to solve the two biggest problems vs a solution that tries to solve the non-existent problems while contributing to the two biggest problems. 
Typical wallets with the intimidating backup and security process is why so many people roll the dice and hold a vast majority of crypto on exchanges and hosted wallets... causing problem  Those that decide to try and manage keys themselves using the recommended "super secure" solutions then fall into 
We're trying to bridge the gap by offering a familiar and forgiving solution that prevents both 1 and 2
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:11:52
If you are in the US then I'd recommend Airbitz to both buy and store your coin all in one app. You fully control your private keys using the app. Outside of the US you can still use Airbitz to store your bitcoin but you'd have to use a different exchange and then transfer your coins to Airbitz. I'd recommend the following exchanges
Europe: bity.com
Phillippines: rebit.ph
India: Coinsecure or Unocoin
Canada: Kraken
Mexico: Bitso
Brazil: mercadobitcoin
Australia: Independent Reserve or Coinjar

Actually using Glidera within Airbitz has lower fees than Coinbase. Coinbase charges 1.5%. Glidera through Airbitz charges 1%.

The user experience will be much the same as Circle &amp; Coinbase in most developed countries. People will add their bank account details and issue a buy/sell. The difference is that buys immediately send bitcoin to the user's wallet vs sitting with a custodial account. How long the buys will take will depend on a variety of factors that are in control of the buy/sell partner. Estimate 2-4 days for new accounts and possibly down to instant buy for small amounts with established accounts. This will be mostly out of Airbitz's control.
Note also that the buys and sells are not visible by Airbitz, only the buy/sell partner. These transactions don't go through our servers but instead go directly from the app to the buy/sell partners providing a higher level of privacy.
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:28:10
Airbitz is very much NOT a hosted wallet. The registration is just a username and password. No name, address, or phone number. The username and password are used to encrypt your keys and backup your data. They don't reveal anything about your identity. They are even cryptographically hashed (encrypted) before they leave your device so Airbitz doesn't even see the plaintext values of either.
See our FAQ:
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:13:27
I'd recommend trying Airbitz. You still control your own money but you don't have to deal with backing up or encryption and security. Just a username and password automatically encrypts, backs up, and synchronizes your wallet across all your devices with full privacy and only you control your funds. 
It also has the most simple implementation of 2FA ever. 
Disclaimer: cofounder
But I built this wallet to address the issues with ease of use and ease of security of all other wallets I've ever used.

SPV is actually quite taxing on your battery. Wallets that use super nodes that index the blockchain are much more efficient at the cost of requiring trust in the super node.

Give Airbitz a try. I think you'll find it the easiest to setup and use wallet for the average person, but it also has some great security and usability with transaction tagging, transaction search, and other hidden usability features.

You can login to devices that you've previously logged into before even in airplane mode as this only decrypts your data. Note that you need to use your full username and password. PIN logins do need Airbitz servers. 
Note that encrypted versions of your keys are stored in a P2P network as a backup for users and to sync their wallet between devices. The data can only be decrypted by users' credentials. As a company, Airbitz has no ability to decrypt the data. Even more so, we (nor anyone who might hack into our servers) can't even associate encrypted data with public addresses to know where any value is stored. 
Our merchant directory is currently under our control. This isn't  specifically for the business model but rather to help reduce garbage listings, increase accuracy and quality. We manually verify every listing before it gets on the directory. We aim to make this a more crowd sourced effort by opening up additions and removal to the general public but only after we add code that allows the community to achieve consensus on good vs bad listings. 
That's pretty much limited by development resources. If someone wanted to work on it, that would get us much closer to fully opening up the directory content. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:38:47

Yes but only because it will be replaced by Edge Wallet which will have multi currency and advanced functionality like Segwit baked in. Users should be able to seamlessly transition. By entering their Airbitz credentials in Edge.

Note that the backup is distributed across several P2P storage nodes and your own phone/tablet is a backup as well. All of our storage nodes PLUS your own phone would have to be taken out in order for your data to get wiped out.
Nevertheless, for those that absolutely want a paper backup, you can tap the Export button in the Transactions -&gt; Wallets dropdown and export the master private seed. It's not a friendly 12-24 word seed yet but a future release will support BIP39 mnemonics.

That's like saying that Linux has the only official internet protocol implementation and that we shouldn't be using Cisco's because critical code could cause a disconnect of large portions of the network.
Remember that Bitcoin is NOT open source software. It is a protocol, a language, which is implemented in open source software. It can and should be implemented in multiple software implementations for the health of the eco-system. Even Gavin Andreesen has stated this on stage at conferences.
The more different implementations we have that share the hashing power of the network, the less likely that one bug in the software could cause a long lasting fork for the entire network.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:46:00
The option and freedom is absolutely there. No one is forcing anyone to do one vs the other. But part of the freedom is also educating people on the differences, their pros &amp; cons, and on their opinions. I honestly think that unless MOST people use decentralized bitcoin, then bitcoin will eventually fail in its current form. We will see arbitrary inflation, we will see biased access to the financial system, we will see fractional reserve and a house-of-cards economy. All of the core benefits of bitcoin rely on individual, decentralized ownership of funds. Without which we lose all its advantages.

Your Nano S is only as safe as how you backup the keys. I've heard of numerous people putting their hardware wallet keys into dropbox or google drive as a backup mechanism. Bad idea. I've also heard of people leaving them on a piece of paper at their office desk. Also a bad idea. If you can't figure out how to secure that backup where you both 1) won't lose it and 2) won't allow someone else to easily see it, then a hardware wallet isn't for you. 
I'd instead recommend multisig with something like Copay and have the keys split between yourself, another person you trust, and possibly an old phone you never use, sitting in a closet. This way you have both redundancy but also added security in that multiple "things" need to be compromised to get to your money.
If you are good with physical security (like many gold bugs are) and have things like a fire proof safe, then a hardware wallet is cool for you

Xapo is not a wallet. They are a bank.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:22:12
You do control your keys with Airbitz and no email is needed to use the wallet. If you want to buy bitcoin with one of the integrated providers (Glidera, Bity) then you'll have to provide THEM with your email but it's not in any way tied to your wallet. They do not get your private keys or your transaction info.
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:45:23
It depends on your definition of a wallet. For all of history, a wallet has held funds that the user/owner fully controlled. It was your cash or coins. For the first time in history, someone can control their own digital cash the same way they controlled physical money. That's what bitcoin brings, but that's only true with a real bitcoin wallet where users control their private keys. With Xapo, you have a bank in every way, shape, and form. They fully hold and control your funds. Funds can be frozen, seized, fractionally reserved, squandered, or mismanaged.

We are still looking to close our full round and we have plenty of interest. With that, we'll have plenty of runway for our next major milestones. And we run pretty darn lean with a team that's super focused on the long term success of Airbitz and bitcoin rather than the short term goal of individual wealth.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:46:16
Yes. That's the case for all implementations unless they have a full node. But yes, they'd have to query addresses on a regular basis since there is no push notify. That keeps the impact on the server much lower as the server does not have to keep state on the client connections. That may change in the future if someone can put the resources into adding push notify
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:36:44
They could shut down our servers, but the Airbitz wallet accesses not just our servers but also decentralized, open source public bitcoin nodes and multiple 3rd party APIs not controlled by Airbitz. The wallet can at minimum send out users funds even if Airbitz goes down. 
A user can always log into their wallet on their phone by using their username and password even without Airbitz servers so long as they have logged in at least once before on that device.
@_date: 2015-07-18 10:26:05
Your best bet for a secure experience with little effort or knowledge is a good mobile wallet. Give Airbitz a try as it only requires a simple username &amp; password to setup a wallet and you are auto-encrypted and auto-backed up. Then enable 2-factor authentication in settings and you've got a very secure but super easy to setup and use wallet. (disclaimer: I'm a co-founder). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to let us know. Some other good options that are decently simple to setup are Breadwallet and Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:58:46
Not much you can do. The phrase is cryptographically secure and can't be 'guessed'. 
Coinbase on the other hand is a bank. Bitcoin as an ecosystem gains very little if everyone just uses a bank to store bitcoin.
Try Airbitz instead. Feels like a bank, but you control your own money with full privacy and autonomy. Access it with the familiarity of a username/password. You can even enable password recovery (it's a bit tough to use at this time), and even use our One-Touch 2 Factor which is super easy to enable and invisible to use.

The functionality you require, while interesting to the extreme power user, doesn't cater to the common user that we are trying to serve with Airbitz. We try to provide the highest level of security and privacy for a user that doesn't care to incorporate any extra work to gain those benefits. We strongly respect all the various wallets in the space and the beauty of bitcoin is that unlike banks, which are more of less the same, bitcoin wallets provide a huge range of options and people can choose which suits them best.

They are only insured for 3% of the funds they hold which is equivalent to how much they hold in their hot wallet. Also, should they become large enough, nothing stops them from inflating or fractionally reserving their holdings. Then we're back to the legacy banking model and have gained nothing from bitcoin. What happened in Greece could happen again even with globally mass adopted bitcoin. People would be camped out at the front doors of their custodial bitcoin wallet companies wondering why they can only pull out 60 mBTC per day.

CEO of Airbitz here. 
This is definitely a tough challenge for newbs at this stage in bitcoin. It requires quite a bit of due diligence to determine a trustworthy wallet and all of us in the development space are each trying to do our best job. Even those who have had problems. 
Definitely track record is a major one to look at. You are right that downloads and even App Store placement isn't a definitive metric. Good timing by an app could easily get it great numbers in the stores. The current  app for "Bitcoin wallet" on the App Store is almost a year old with no updates, closed source, and has no visibility on who the developers are. 
I would say that if you spend any time researching a wallet, research the people behind it. The team, their ethos, their understanding of bitcoin. Are they publicly visible? Have they contributed through written content or public speaking. 
I think in the end, the plethora of wallet options will whittle down to a few players who weather the storms of hacking attacks and attrition. Those who can consistently provide a great balance of security, customer service, functionality, and ease of use. 
We hope and are convinced Airbitz will be one of those players and our team is working damn hard to build the best product we can to make that happen.

Definitely keep it in a wallet that you control. Otherwise you're using a bank. I'd of course recommend Airbitz on mobile (most familiar user experience to mobile banking but you control keys 100%) or apps like Multibit, Electrum on the desktop although be careful of malware on the desktop. On average, your mobile device is likely your most secure device

If you use a wallet such as [Airbitz]( then as soon as you create an account, the private keys are auto encrpyted and auto backed up. But in such a way that only you have access to them.

Works like mobile banking but giving you real bitcoin financial autonomy &amp; privacy

If you are going to recommend Mycelium, the most important thing to walk them through is backing up their seed. Or simply use Airbitz and know they are automatically backed up. 
I think this is a good start but there is almost too much information. Start simpler to not overwhelm. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:24:19
Good requests. Scan pub address for balance is a reasonable request. We'll consider this as a small added feature to Airbitz.
IAP is most definitely restricted by Apple. However Airbitz will be offering buy/sell integrated in the app through third party providers. We'll give the vertically integrated feel but with a real bitcoin wallet vs a custodial bank wallet.
Given that Airbitz holds meta data per transaction, we can store locally entrypted data regarding location info per transaction. Some freak out with privacy concerns, and we do care a lot about privacy though.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:44:26
It does do instant address lookup. You can query by address or txid or stealth address. Coming soon: query by prefix query. You do have to poll though. SPV isn't available yet though.  Maybe you guys can work on it :)  The spec is in place and it will provide super fast SPV. As opposed to one by one headers, you'll be able to request a header range and get everything blasted down to you in one call.

Libbitcoin has a client and server component. Airbitz uses the client component to do various bitcoin/blockchain operations, public private key operations, public address generation, and also accessing of the libbitcoin servers. The server component hosts the full blockchain, does full consensus and transaction validation and propagation.
an iPhone can easily handle all the client-side logic as it only hosts information for the addresses in the local wallet

One thing that should be mentioned is that people should generally use browsers that are not logged into persistent accounts like Facebook or Google. Having those logged into in the background, even while using Tor, will divulge your web behavior from a lot of sites to Google.

The ability and ease of securing private keys is a task for the wallet software. Developers at companies like Airbitz are the ones tasked with building software that makes securing private keys not just easy, but ideally invisible. You do what you're accustomed to with mobile banking but you get bitcoin private key security without realizing it.

In all honesty, I fundamentally believe if the world needs to use a Trezor like device to secure their savings, we won't have mass adoption of bitcoin. We need to make it far simpler and more familiar than that. It is a great device for us early adopters but an unfamiliar, intimidating challenge for the 99 percentile.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:58:18
Give Airbitz a try, for redundancy we use multiple, 3rd party APIs and servers to send transactions independent of Airbitz. We also use open source, publicly available libbitcoin servers to query the blockchain. We try to make the wallet is independent from us as possible. You can even login if Airbitz servers are down.

The Airbitz app supports both brick and mortar and online shops. Just choose "On the Web" as the search location.

Awesome hear and that's our goal. We like to provide the complex logic in the software so that users don't have to deal with it in the UI. Let us know if you ever have any comments or feedback.

If you want a super familiar experience, try Airbitz. No technical experience needed. Simple username/password and everything is auto-encrypted and auto-backed up. No fear of losing your phone with your money. You can even access your money from multiple devices.

Per what said, there are tradeoffs between SPV and supernode wallets but the Libbitcoin project is looking to combine the best of both with a very fast SPV header download protocol that can even go through an encrypted channel while also giving very fast indexed queries. All in a free, open source, supernode server anyone can run. Airbitz already uses Libbitcoin and we look forward to adding this support. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:47:09
We'll be doing SPV but still by accessing Libbitcoin nodes, not Bitcoin Core nodes. The SPV spec going into Libbitcoin provides super fast access to download the headers. Instead of slowly syncing the blockchain, we could do it in a couple seconds. We're hoping for that this year, but it depends on resources put into Libbitcoin which are slim at the moment.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:28:25
Awesome. Glad to hear it worked for you. Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:10:01
Based on the feature list you show, sounds like Airbitz already has you covered. Although not simple, you can backup the HD master private key of each wallet using the export feature. This can generate the private keys for every address in your wallet. You can of course tag all your transactions, it is open source, has very active development, and you and only you control all your keys. Now of course it is still a single signature hot wallet but so is BitWallet, which you were considering.
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:25:02
This is not specific to Airbitz. The protocol has a minimum threshold for what is not dust. In addition, high mining fees due to the blocksize limit effectively make smaller transactions effectively dust. Try to send anything smaller and it will cost you more to spend that output than what was received. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:24:00
This is entirely untrue. Airbitz has zero control of private keys other than a fully encrypted backup that only the user can decrypt. You can simply login to your account using any other iOS or Android device and your account will auto-sync and decrypt the data on the other device.

Luckily for banks, people have short term memory. 2008 wasn't that far away. The govt practically flipped a coin in deciding on doing one of two things. Bail out the banks, or let them deal with it (lose people's money) Listen to Edmund Moy's (38th Directory of the US Mint) keynote at Cryptolina in 2014 (wish I could find the video!)

Don't listen to this troll. He's referring to his maximalist support of Bitcoin Core at all costs. Even if it's the minority chain with little or no hashing power. Airbitz believes in supporting the strongest chain with the most hashing power and therefore the strongest security. Feel free to read the blog post and decide for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:37:31


Did you not read the part about Bitcoin Core currently having the most amount of mining power at ~70%? I never mentioned Jihan. And what part about "Should Bitcoin Unlimited achieves 75% of majority mining power, it would become the strongest chain" could you possibly have issue with? That's plain technical truth whether you like BU or not.
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:50:10
I would not expect any mobile device to handle a full node, whether it be Libbitcoin, Bitcoin Core, BTCD, or any other such implementation. Even with pruning and other optimizations, the phone would need an uncomfortable amount of bandwidth and consistent cpu utilization to not make it a smart choice. Not impossible, but not smart. And it would only get worse.

My of the people in Greece are no libertarian, they simply care about being able to user their money when they want to. Centralized wallets don't provide that capability. Even without govt intervention, they can't guarantee your funds are available for use due to most of it being offline at any one moment in time.

@_date: 2015-07-31 18:49:59
We've thought about it a lot, but a few things render it challenging. First and foremost is the lack of transparency of the App Store. And since no app can look at the binary of another app, there isn't a way to verify it. Unless of course the phone is jailbroken but that presents other problems.
Second is the fact that the app utilizes several API keys to access our own servers and for several 3rd party services such as Google Maps and several blockchain API providers (we are not dependent on any one so still no single point of failure). The keys would inherently cause a binary mismatch from a separate build utilizing different keys. 
We can reduce API key dependency in the future but it still comes down to the issue of being able to look at the binary using a separate application which to the best of our knowledge, isn't doable.
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:12:04
Note that Mycelium and Electrum use two very different categories of servers. Mycelium uses their own proprietary server of which they run three of. It's worked great for years so until the stress test, who could blame them.
Electrum is an open source server than anyone, and many people do, run independently from the Electrum developers. Wallets that use Electrum can effectively access any publicly known Electrum servers.
Airbitz, which uses Libbitcoin, uses the same model as Electrum. Obviously anything can happen to any number of servers, but the more decentralized you are, the better your chances of connecting to an available node.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:15:56
I talked in detail with OBPP guys and they agreed about several points where Airbitz lost up to 5 or 6 points due to misunderstandings about our architecture. We're looking forward to the updated ratings where we are confident our privacy rankings should improve, even with little to no changes to our code. And we definitely do not collect any personal information about the user.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:20:07
Same but different. It feels like online banking, but private keys are created on your device, encrypted on your device, then backed up to peer-to-peer servers. Even if Airbitz goes down, you can still login to your phone and send money. Check out this FAQ

Hi Paul and thanks for the kudos. Even with our raise (which is not yet completed) we still don't have the resources to do a desktop wallet and it's still not our focus at this time.
We do hope to lead in the merchant directory department and as we build out our team, we intend to incorporate functionality that will allow the Airbitz directory to be crowd sourced in a similar, but far more user friendly manner, to Coinmap.

We never said such a thing. We will go with the strongest chain which is looking likely to NOT be BU. We've supported segwit from the early days and even had Core dev Eric Lombrozo speak about it at our offices for the bitcoin meetup. We want segwit and bigger blocks to push through. We don't really care which order. I'm mostly frustrated by the in fighting, stubbornness, and unwillingness of either side to compromise. And by the overexaggerted FUD and mis-quotes like yours above.

That's an extremely poor analogy. By trusting a 3rd party node you are not trusting them with the ability to walk away with your money at any point in time the way a hosted service could. That's a typical maximalist view that thinks everyone should be running their own node. Not even Satoshi believed that.

Clevercoin would clearly have information about your purchase of bitcoin and the immediate address in Airbitz that it goes to. However, they wouldn't know about all the future transactions you do with the money since that is held in Airbitz which is a zero knowledge platform. This is a marked improvement over buying Bitcoin through Coinbas or Circle and using their wallet where they have full knowledge of all transactions. 
Using Clevercoin integrated into Airbitz is no different than buying Bitcoin from Bitstamp with your bank acct then immediately transferring it to a wallet like Airbitz or Mycelium which gives you full privacy and control of keys

@_date: 2017-04-29 07:31:53
Airbitz is very much not like Coinbase. Notice you never enter an email, name, or phone number to use the wallet. The username and password are only used to encrypt and backup your private keys. It is the most private wallet that still gives the usability of a hosted wallet. Airbitz was ranked the  most private cross platform mobile wallet by the OBPP. In contrast Coinbase ranked last. 
The permissions the app asks for are for the app itself to access to help in usability (such as tagging transactions). That data isn't sent to Airbitz for us to see. The app is open source so that can be verified as true. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:12:14

Airbitz has been supporting BitID since late 2015 and is also supported by Ledger and Mycelium. Glidera supports it as an authentication mechanism and we certainly hope that crypto exchanges start supporting it soon as well as it makes perfect sense.

Unfortunately, Airbitz only offers buy/sell in the US through an integration with Glidera. It doesn't (yet) offer a localtrader type of functionality. Although the open source code is welcome to be modified to add it. It already has an integrated merchant map that can be easily modified to offer peer to peer trading.
@_date: 2016-09-03 18:37:06
The new password recovery can work on old accounts but they need to first set it up on the latest version of the app. Unfortunately we can't simply recover lost passwords for old accounts that weren't setup. 
We know this is one of the biggest challenges for crypto which is why we put so much work in recoverability. At least new users will be easily protected. Note that they do have to go through the setup process but it is pretty simple and they will be reminded to do so after they receive at least 100 mB in their wallet. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 20:03:34
Paul here from Airbitz. Thanks for the feedback We're in touch with Glidera and are working with them to improve the registration process. Admittedly we've seen quite a number of customers failing verification. Those that pass have a smooth time, but too many are getting caught up. This is one of the hardest things for us to put quality QA on as each person is only allowed to register once for the service, so we can't go through a lot of tests, and the verification is partially done by a 3rd party identity verification provider which will generate some red flags on rare occasion that we can't easily duplicate. In the interim, we do suggest using another exchange provider and simply Airbitz as your user-controlled wallet. As a company, we do the same as Glidera is only a consumer product and doesn't yet service business customers such as us. We hope  to improve the experience going forward and thank you for your patience and communication with Glidera.

Try buying something on Fiverr.com for $5. Save 15-20% on Amazon using Purse.io. VPS services (if you're a developer) on servercrate.com or ramnode.com. DNS registration on namecheap.com or check out a local merchant in the Airbitz app. Do make sure to contact them before making a long haul to visit a physical merchant just to make sure they still accept bitcoin.

Apologize for the inconvenience. We launched Edge as we needed a new code base to be able to support new functionality such as Segwit and other blockchains.

Anything is possible. But we have dual db servers that hold the encrypted data, each one backed up every half hour onto offsite servers. AND the user themselves has the private key on their phone which is also a backup of our own infrastructure. We'd like to believe that's a damn good architecture for fault tolerance.

This is a bit misleading but if you tap the [?] next to that statement, it gives details of what that means.
"This wallet gives you control over your bitcoins. However, this service
is retaining an encrypted copy of your wallet. This means your bitcoins can 
be stolen if you don't use a strong password and the service is compromised"
So YOU have full control of your bitcoin and Airbitz only has an encrypted copy as a backup for you. This copy is encrypted with a strong hash of your username and password which only you know. Airbitz has no visibility of your credentials and cannot unlock the data. Choose a good, strong password and it's a solid security model and also quite easy to use.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:44:36
The username and password are strongly hashed to encrypt the private keys and hashed a second time as credentials to upload the encrypted backup to the servers.  This is entirely separate from access to the bitcoin network. The app accesses publicly available nodes much like Electrum and will even work if Edge servers are down. In such a case, a user can simply decrypt their account by logging in with their password. The app can then send/receive funds as it directly accesses the network.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:59:29
Airbitz has no control over your money. Your private keys are encrypted on your phone with your own password which nobody but you knows.

Airbitz gives users full control of their keys. Master private keys (seeds) can be exported at any time and the individual private keys can be derived using a recovery tool. This is how BCH can be extracted from Airbitz wallets and after the S2X fork, this is how users can control coins on both sides of the fork.

Merchant Mode makes a very small change to the UX flow. Normally after payment is received, the user is taken to the Transaction Details screen where they can tag meta data to the transaction. In Merchant Mode, the user is taken back to the Request screen to input a new amount for another payment. This works similar to the POS apps of Bitpay or Coinbase.
Note that if you request a 0 amount while in Merchant Mode, then the app stays on the QR code screen forever. Popups with the amount received will show up then fade away. This is great as a donation QR code sitting on a tablet. Note also that the bitcoin address will always change after a payment is received.
Thanks so much for trying Airbitz. Appreciate the kudos and please send comments and feedback if you have any in the future. And if you really like Airbitz, app store reviews are of course appreciated. :)

Merchant mode does a small subtle change.
Normally after a payment, the user is taken to the Transaction Details screen where they can tag the transaction with meta data.
For merchants, they generally want to go back to the Receive screen to punch in a new payment request. Similar to a POS terminal. Therefore Merchant Mode does exactly this.

If you want the simplest and most familiar mobile wallet to setup, backup, and secure, give Airbitz a try. Lots of great ease of use functionality like transaction tagging, multi - device concurrent access, fast switching between multiple accounts, and the worlds easiest 2FA. 
All of that with a high level of privacy that rivals all wallets short of Dark Wallet. 
Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of Airbitz but I built this wallet to address the short comings I found in all other solutions. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:10:58
Hard to pitch coming from a competitor but I did use Mycelium (on Android) for a year and here's what I liked about it
- Quick and easy to get going. Download the app and you've got a QR code ready to receive funds. It's not yet secure and backed up, but I could demonstrate bitcoin in seconds.
- Proxy support made Tor very easy and usable from the get go.
- Had a MAX button to spend full amount of funds from an address. Was surprised how many other wallets didn't have that. I'd have to guess how much to send, factoring mining fee, to sweep an address
- Was one of the first wallets to support a server super-node (although closed-source, proprietary) for fast blockchain access. No waiting to sync
Now here's why we built [Airbitz]( for those that are looking for a mainstream wallet
- No need to backup wallet. All wallets are auto-encrypted and backed-up. And concurrently accessible across iOS/Android devices
- Support for rich transaction tagging. Payee, category, notes. All 100% encrypted client-side for full privacy.
- Utilizes open-source super-node (libbitcoin) that multiple parties host. No 100% reliance on Airbitz to send funds.
- Open-source license that lets users compile and use the code themselves.
- A more familiar and friendly user experience.
If you want power user features such as spending from cold storage, Trezor integration, watch-only x-pub keys, Tor integration, etc. Mycelium is your choice. If you want a wallet for the masses that still provides true financial autonomy (own your keys) and privacy (all data 100% encrypted) but with a tons of ease of use functionality, then I'd humbly recommend giving [Airbitz]( a try. If you do, please send us feedback.

We've considered this idea, and in actuality, you can simply save the QR code from the Settings screen once you activate 2FA. You actually can scan that QR code using Google Authenticator. The only issue is that GA doesn't let you view the raw token once you've added it to GA. It only lets you view the 30sec One Time Password which we don't let you use.

What is the encryption key used? I hope that the 4-6 digit PIN is not considered the encryption key as that doesn't have nearly enough entropy on its own.

Airbitz encrypts the keys and stores them on your phone AND backs up those encrypted keys on Airbitz P2P servers. Even if the service went down, you'd still have your keys on your phone. Just dont forget your password.

Thanks for the offer. Our co-founder William can help get you setup. It's not super straight forward right now, but it's getting better. Feel free to email william'at'airbitz.co and he can send you instructions.
It would definitely help support everyone using our wallet and anyone using the libbitcoin platform.
Thanks so much.

Airbitz does full AES256 encryption of private keys, public address, and all transaction information all before it ever gets saved on your phone or backed up.
It also uses native C++ compiled code on both iPhone and Android for the encryption and password hashing. Since we use Scrypt running in native C++ code (vs Java or Javascript), we can crank the password hashing strength VERY high. Much higher than most wallets which simply do SHA256.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:03:43
The beauty of bitcoin is you don't have lose your money if you lose your phone. Like mentioned, with a wallet like [Airbitz]( your keys are auto-encrypted for security, then auto-backed up to peer-to-peer servers. If you lose your phone, just punch in your username/password into a new one. Your encrypted keys get downloaded to your phone and decrypted locally.

Be a bit more cautious. it's not about the amount they lose, it's about the fact that they lost it at all (if they do lose it). I've had a few adopters feel alienated by bitcoin because they lost $20. Once you lose $20, would you want to put in $200, let alone $2000, $20000?
I'm a firm believer in getting people setup on "solid, best practice security" from day one so that new users don't stumble into disheartening experiences, even with small amounts of bitcoin.
Give my company's wallet, [Airbitz]( a try. It really is pretty straightforward to setup and they won't have to deal with backups or encryption. It just works "out of the box" and users' private keys and all data are auto-encrypted and auto-backed up while ONLY they have control of their funds and privacy.

If you're interested in trying out to another iOS (or Android) wallet, consider giving [Airbitz]( a try. It is open source, an we have had great testimonials lately with people calling it "The wallet of the future". We'd love to hear your feedback on it and are always looking to improve. Thanks

Great point. And with multi-sig web wallets, it's important to check that the architecture creates the keys using different devices as opposed to a single browser running javascript.

Best user experience is definitely a subjective point that many could disagree on. However, I would recommend giving [Airbitz]( a try. Our focus from day one is to deliver a lot of ease-of-use functionality in a familiar user experience. 
Users fully control their own bitcoin, but they do not have to deal with backing up or encrypting their wallet. You simply create a username and password and everything else is taken care of for you in the background. And we have also designed in a lot of subtle ease-of-use functionality.
Please give it a try and let us know what you think.

It depends on how you are using the API. If you are integrating it into a mobile or desktop applicationand need full bitcoin functionality along with securing the private keys, I would look into Airbitz. 
Unlike the Blockchain.info API, the Airbitz API is a library that you put into your application which can then access the decentralized bitcoin network. The Blockchain.info API utilizes their servers to decrypt your private key, so you are giving up control to them when you use it.
The Airbitz API isn't very developer friendly right now but may be worth the time investment to build a more robust app.

Give [Airbitz]( a try. It's for iPhone and Android and it's designed for the average joe. The design takes the complexity of encryption and backup of private keys and makes it invisible to the user.

Check out Airbitz. You can set a 0 daily spending limit so staff can't spend without the password. 
Then set Merchant Mode on to make the UI flow more conducive to merchants. 
It's also the only wallet that detects partial payments then changes the QR code to request the remaining balance.

 "Plus if someone reads your key or guesses your password you are not screwed"
This depends on the rules put in place by the multisig oracle. If they will sign any transaction below a certain threshold, then you wouldn't be better off than single sig when dealing with amounts below that threshold. Someone with username/password (if not 2FA) would be able to spend those same amounts either way
@_date: 2015-04-26 00:30:00
Unless you are standing there next to her to set her up, I wouldn't say so. Backup by 12 word seeds isn't a familiar process that we have EVER had to do with a financial app. I've lost a few new possible bitcoiners because I told them they had to do this. 
A username and password is a familiar process. And to help them remember their password, the app will remind them after they use their PIN to login every so often. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:09:34

Encrypted with the user's username+password, hashed using Scrypt, dynamically tuned to the users' phone speed. 
We sync the data to Git based peer to peer servers which we host. The servers auto sync to each the user's logged in devices so it feels like mobile banking but in reality it's end-to-end encrypted synchronization.

Thanks for the feedback. Sorry the directory felt 'adverty'. We really made it a "background" feature. And there aren't even any ads on it. Purely closest listings, and what you search for.
Thanks for the heads up on the "location warning" bug. 
Note that your location is not in any way tied to the wallet acct or any other info. It's purely to query for listings. But I can still understand your concern. We'll get that fixed.
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:12:31
Not at this time. But keep an eye out for integrated buy/sell coming out of Airbitz. 
You keep your money and privacy, but can link a bank acct to do buy/sell. You'll need to give personal info to buy but the bitcoin will always be held in private keys that you yourself own and control. Significantly better privacy then any hosted wallet buy/sell service
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:37:26
Ack. Here's the right link. Sorry
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:57:55
Absolutely. A new address for every receive and and new address for all change from sends.
We also do a lil extra UX candy with HD addresses. If you send a payment request via email or SMS, the wallet saves the email, name, or phone number from that request along with the amount requested and the fiat value at the time of the request.
Once money comes in to that address, the transaction meta data is prepopulated will all that saved info so you know who you requested the funds from, and how much you requested. It's like having a merchant invoicing system in your wallet
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:19:16
With respect to man in the middle attacks, Airbitz users are pretty much immune to them. All information that is saved on the phone or sent over the network is first hashed or encrypted. Our servers do not store anything in clear text and the application does not transmit anything in clear text. We assume a fully compromised network in our security architecture. But to prevent a compromised communications channel, we also implement certificate pinning to know that the application is talking specifically to our servers. 
Phishing attacks are also near useless. Airbitz does not have a website for wallet access, and users never enter their username or password into anything but the mobile application. In addition, we do not send two factor verification to users email address. An attacker can create a phishing attack to random email addresses, but it would be an obvious attack since users are not accustomed to logging into a website to access their wallet. 
Our one-touch 2FA also makes it near impossible to gain access to an account from an attacker's device even if they have a user's username and password. It basically implements Google Authenticator built into the app with time-based, tokenized, One Time Passwords. 
Malware on the phone is a difficult attack to thwart. We cannot prevent all forms of malware attack, but one thing that we do is prevent any private keys from being saved on the device unencrypted. Unencrypted keys only live in the temporary memory of the application. Malware that looks for sensitive information saved on storage will only find fully encrypted keys. 
Here is a great video that was recently done from a third-party auditing our security architecture
With respect to our UI design, have you tried our latest releases since late February? We have cleaned up and simplified the design and have received very positive feedback on it. 
Know that there is a tremendous amount of functionality built into the wallet so we do our best to balance simple user experience with functionality that makes for an easier to use experience. We are always open to hearing specific feedback on how to improve the user experience without compromising the functionality. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 07:10:54
The restore process requires custom scripts to extract the private keys. But you can send out your money even if Airbitz goes down. You can login to your phone using your username/password (not PIN login) even if Airbitz is down. Then you can send out your funds since Airbitz directly accesses bitcoin nodes and other 3rd parties.

That's a pretty old video but I don't believe I said that Coinkite isn't multisig.

@_date: 2015-04-05 09:04:28
A password is at least much higher entropy than a PIN.
Our solution in Airbitz requires a server but is much more secure than encrypting with a PIN. You can encrypt the data with a full 256bit key. Call it a master key (MK). Take another 256bit random value (KEY) and hash it with the PIN. Call that PINk. Create another random value (deviceID). Upload deviceID, MK, and PINk to a server and save only KEY and deviceID on the phone.
To PIN login, hash the user entered PIN with KEY (PINk) and send to server with deviceID. If server matches deviceID &amp; PINk, it sends down MK which the phone can use to decrypt the data. Server can also rate limit the PIN attempts. If server dies or gets compromised, all it has are MKs which are useless without the phones' data. If the server goes away, the 12 word backup does the job.
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:26:07
Better than no encryption, but no amount of key stretching will make an 8 digit PIN secure and still usable to login to an app. 
IF a user chose an 8 digit PIN (I'm sure many people don't) and if your scrypt took 3 seconds on a mobile device, then brute force attack on it would take 3472 days. 
That sounds like a lot. But if you consider that an attacker would pull the data off and brute force it on a desktop, then a decent couple of graphics cards bring that down several orders of magnitude.
I guess it's then a race between getting to your backup and someone brute forcing the data.

Is that solution works for you then keep with it. However since you asked why you should consider other alternatives, here are a few:
Blockchain.info still does not rotate addresses automatically. This is the most important and easiest thing to do to gain significantly higher privacy.
Although you do own your private keys, BC.info is still rather centralized in that you are 100% dependent on their servers in order to send and receive funds (outside of utilizing your backup). This affects reliability, security, privacy, and potentially your ability to send funds to specific parties. Your computer or phone is having to give 100% trust to BC.info when it comes to determining which transactions are in the blockchain.
If any of these things are a concern to you then I would consider some other wallet solutions like [Airbitz]( (FYI, I'm a co-founder), Bitcoin Wallet (for Android), or Breadwallet.
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:30:25
If you think BC.info is easy, give [Airbitz]( a try. Also on both iPhone and Android. Just a username &amp; password creates an auto-encrypted and auto-backed up wallet accessible across iPhone and Android. Give it a try and send feedback.

The reason for the 7 day wait is because our privacy measures have the app not collect any personal info such as an email or phone number. Without such info, we cannot verify the true owner of an account to reset the 2FA. During those 7 days, any devices that did have access to the account would be getting a warning notification that a reset was requested. 
Your suggestion of warning users of the case of uninstalling and reinstalling the app is a valid concern and we'll incorporate it into our next release. 
Apologies again for the inconvenience. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:15:06
I don't recommend it as it's closed source and info on the developers/company is nowhere to be found. No address, phone number, non-existent social media

Not really. And they could claim it was a bug in their code. No one would know for the better.
Looking at the publisher (Sollico Software), their webpage has NO information about the company. No names, phone number, address, team information, nothing. In the dozen+ conferences I've been to, I've never seen or met a representative of the company. They've never published any blog posts on Bitcoin, done any interviews, and don't even seem to have an active social media account. Their twitter acct has one post from 2009.
It's almost disturbing to see that they are the  bitcoin wallet in the iOS App Store.
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:31:38
Are you looking for a POS solution? 
Having the private keys on the device isn't a terrible option so long as the app doesn't let a user export the keys or spend from it. Then you can just sweep the funds every few days to another account. 
Airbitz offers an option to enforce spending limits. It prevents an account user from spending over a daily set amt without the password. You can give them the PIN to login but require the password to spend. 
You can even allow a small amt of daily spending to allow refunds.

Right now the receipt would have to be a traditional paper receipt. In the future we can fix this with the payment protocol which can send a receipt back to the user. We're looking at supporting it but are a bit hesitant due to the need for Internet connectivity and the requirement of a centralized authority to issue x509 certs. But it is a very valuable use case that can make bitcoin payments surpass other mobile payment methods. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:14:43
Very good point. So we strike the balance by encrypting the keys using a full password (10 digit, upper, lowercase, + number). But we allow quick PIN logins using a 4 digit PIN and the architecture mentioned above. PIN login needs a server, but we could transact w/o a server in those times of need by utilizing a full password to "login". If on iOS, you could also use the hardware enclave if you trust it (ie. Breadwallet).
I fully agree with the need to support offline transactions via BLE etc. We'll be adding that. We just consider an architecture that more fully takes advantage of what conditions you have but offers a graceful fallback.

Although Airbitz still has the merchant directory, rest assured that the two operate very independently so as to not compromise privacy. Nothing you do in the merchant directory is associated with the wallet. Even if you tag a transaction with a local merchant, that data is encrypted, local, client-side. No one sees it but you.
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:00:09
Not that this time. We will be supporting shared-wallets in a few months. This will allow one account to "share" one of its wallets with another account. The access granted can be either receive-only (pub keys), full spend access (1 of n multisig), or variable consensus (m of n multisig).
We think that this concept and implementation of "shared wallets" is a much more user friendly, familiar, and mass adoptable piece of functionality than "importing of x-pub addresses" which would alienate many non-technical users
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:12:04
The libbitcoin implementation of SPV (which Airbitz will use) will offer the most privacy and performance of any implementation on the market. Unlike current SPV wallets which only connect to nodes using unencrypted communications, a client can connect to a libbitcoin-server using encrypted (SSL-like) communications. This provides higher levels of privacy against man-in-the-middle snooping attacks. 
In addition, it will also support a fast and light API endpoint to quickly download all headers in a specific block range. It will only take seconds to synchronize the entire list of blockchain headers. 
Airbitz wallets will also support connecting to arbitrary libbitcoin-servers including those not operated by Airbitz. This provides a high level of decentralization and protection against any attacks directed towards Airbitz.
@_date: 2016-10-24 00:36:17
I think those that can handle the complexities of cold storage and hardware wallets do so because from the viewpoint of security against an outside attacker, those solutions are more secure. But when you factor in all the causes of bitcoin loss, the likelihood of loss comes more from user error than device hacks. The ranked causes of bitcoin loss are
 Centralized services getting hacked
 User error with self controlled wallet solutions
a distant 
 Actual hacks on user devices
Ironically, people use centralized services because of fear of  Likely because the community advocates some of the most difficult user-controlled solutions which lead to  
I believe firmly that security is about shielding against the most likely forms of attack, even if the attack vector is the user themselves. We don't deny that user device hacks and malware are a reality, which is why Airbitz never writes unencrypted keys to the device like many wallets do. But we choose to draw the line in security solutions that create largely unfamiliar and unforgiving situations for the 95%+ of users in the world.
Granted if you are a business and securing bitcoin on behalf of your customers or even just for the business itself, then you should have the time, patience, and expertise on staff to utilize more advanced security such as multi-sig, hardware wallets, or cold-storage as you likely now are incorporating multi-user access to funds which significantly increases the risk of theft.

For some parts of the world, investing via fiat can be quite costly. To make our minimum investment of $300, it would cost an international wire transfer fee of typically $40. That's over 10% of your investment. With bitcoin and a 1% fee that comes down to $3 making international investments very reasonable. This is why we're excited about this integration. It's very good use-case for bitcoin.

Great talk MK. This really connects the technology and ethos of decentralization and helps realize how it can bring about incredibly positive change.

I wouldn't necessarily consider them vulnerable. Modern phones have pretty darn good security with app sandboxing, disk level encryption, and remote wipe. I'd say mobile is a far more secure platform than most desktops. 
With that said, if you look at security, it isn't a linear scale of 0-100. You have to ask what are your biggest security concerns and how to mitigate them. In bitcoin the top 3 biggest causes of loss are 
1st: Hosted wallets/exchanges getting hacked
2nd: Users losing the keys due to complex backup or encryption processes
A distant 3rd: Individual devices getting hacked. 
This would imply that more time should be focused on  and 2. 
So first and foremost, DONT keep your money on hosted wallets and exchanges. Second, since you'll be controlling the keys yourself, use tools that make the process of encrypting and backing up the keys very simple and relatively forgiving to error. If the process feels foreign and intimidating, you'll have a good chance of messing it up. 
Keeping funds on multiple, encrypted paper wallets scattered in various places is just asking for user error. A good mobile wallet that's easy to backup and keeps keys encrypted is the best bet for probably 95% of users
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:59:56
Sure it does. A stolen phone gives someone full access to the phone's storage but not to encrypted data.
It is also much easier to read other files on the drive vs actually log keystrokes. App memory sandboxing is far harder to break than reading other parts of the drive. And a basic keylogger can be defeated using a custom app keyboard.
Just because it's not fool proof (which nothing is) doesn't mean it doesn't improve security.
@_date: 2015-09-10 12:09:17

Multisig does not automatically mean "no single point of failure". It all depends on how it's implemented.
Almost all web based multisig wallets actually have a single point of failure. Most all of them generate 2 of the 3 keys using javascript on the user's browser. Compromise the javascript, you've compromised the keys.
Please analyze the full threat model before stamping a wallet secure-for-mass-storage just because it has multisig.

Technically bnktothefuture is not crowdfunding. They only accept accredited investors (about $1MM networth or $300k income/yr). For US companies, the Jobs Act is the first time non-accredited investors could invest in startups. And this launch is the first with bitcoin.

Actually a very little portion of the raise goes to lawyers for compliance documents. WeFunder focuses on exactly this type of fundraising hence the docs are nearly boiler plate. We had to do a $1500 financial review with a CPA and mostly just marketing expenses of updating a website and creating a video which is not any more than an ICO. 
WeFunder is the crowdfunding portal and they are taking in the bitcoin payments themselves utilizing Bitpay. Both WeFunder, Bitpay, and their partner bank have done a rigorous amount of compliance work to make sure everything is clean for this launch. An ICO would incur far more liability since we don't want our platform to require another cryptocurrency to be able to be used. We'd prefer the flexibility of other monetization strategies. Therefore the ICO for us would end up having to be for equity which would be very non-compliant.

To my understanding, the keys are only encrypted with the PIN (if you set one) and a key inside the app. Note that a PIN is quite low entropy and easy to brute force so really you are relying on your phone's security to protect you if the phone is stolen. I believe the iOS version uses the secure enclave to store the keys encrypted.

This is Paul here from Airbitz. Can you elaborate on how Airbitz "lost" a private key? Airbitz is an HD deterministic wallet and all private keys in a wallet are generated from one master private key. Airbitz can't lose just one key but would have lost them all which our wallet has never done. Were there some funds that were inaccessible from within Airbitz? If the recovery tool worked to pull out your funds then the private key was never lost.  I'd be very grateful to better understand the exact situation you ran into. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 01:50:53
And the backup process for Airbitz is simply knowing your username and password. For extra security, enable One-Touch 2 Factor and password recovery. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:10:15
My keys at encrypted using AES256 with a strong scrypt hash of minimum 10 character password making brute force attack very difficult. Then they are backed up to redundant peer to peer cloud servers to make sure they are never lost. As I use the keys on multiple devices (iPhone and Android tablet), I synchronize them between devices also making each device a backup of the other. My encrypted keys are easily decrypted with TouchID on my phone or a PIN on my Android. 
Oh yeah, my wallet Airbitz does all the above automatically for me with no extra software to setup. :-)

Without a running a node, you can still do transaction detection using various SDK packages such as Bitcore or Libbitcoin which can access publicly accessible nodes. Airbitz Core would also let you do this and actually run a full wallet on your server but the SDK language binding is only in C at this point. You'd have to wrap it for most website frameworks.
@_date: 2016-10-30 21:27:29
The wallet part is easy because that's pure Bitcoin. You probably setup an Airbitz wallet in like 30 seconds. Now linking a bank account can be a pain. Bitcoin and banks are like oil and water and few companies can get them to work well together. Give Circle a try for buying coin but make sure to transfer your funds out to a real wallet like Airbitz. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:27:40
You enable 2FA on an Airbitz account and that protects the username and password from a keylogger or someone just guessing it. And you don't have to write it down like a mnemonic. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:03:49
Hi Thanks for your feedback. I don't disagree that we're definitely not as 'snappy' as other wallets. The need to encrypt and decrypt transaction metadata slows things down a bit but we've recently put in some big performance improvements to our latest release (waiting app store approval but we can send you a beta if you'd like). And we've got even more performance improvements coming. 
If super simple features and snappy functionality is your things, then BW is great. We target simplicity in securing bitcoin for the average non-bitcoin user who gets alienated with a 24 word backup phrase. We also see transaction meta data as an important piece for long term adoption of bitcoin and have put huge efforts in securing that data.
WRT intuitive interface, I'd love to hear what part of UX flow could be improved and we'll look at improving those aspects.

For short or long periods of time but more specifically for medium amounts of value (spending funds) I'd recommend Airbitz (disclaimer: I'm a co-founder). You can buy/sell in most US States integrated from within the app. It's available on iOS or Android.
For anything larger, a hardware wallet for now like Trezor or Ledger Wallet although they are definitely tricky for the avg person to use.
For trading, give SFOX.com a try. They don't support all US states yet but they have solid trading functionality.

Yes if a user BOTH lost their phone AND Airbitz fully disappeared, the user would lose their funds. But at least one is the backup of the other. More people have lost their paper backup than lost data from a cloud storage provider. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:40:14
The warning is telling you that the transaction was flagged by the sender as "Replace by Fee" (RBF). This allows the sender to double spend the transaction by just resending it with a higher mining fee. This is only possible before a confirmation. Once the transaction is confirmed, the RBF flag has no meaning. Therefore, there is a higher chance of this transaction getting double spent and you should therefore wait for a confirmation before accepting it for payment for anything of significant value.  Note that the Airbitz wallet will not let you spend those funds until they have confirmed.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:58:32
Most users do NOT have to have the complete blockchain. They can hold just a portion of the blockchain that contains information regarding the transactions they care about. For additional security, they can also hold the headers of the blockchain which helps provide proof of the transactions they care about. Headers take on the order of just 10s of megabytes vs 10s of gigabytes. No wallet available on mobile will download the entire blockchain. Check out [Airbitz]( for a super simple to secure and use bitcoin wallet on Android or iPhone. It only downloads a few MB of data to your phone
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:36:12
I especially wouldn't recommend users use a custodial account like Coinjar as a hot wallet. I've had too many transactions take a long time because hosted wallets run out of shared hot wallet funds. I'm pretty sure only a fraction of hosted wallet funds are online at any time. And when that gets drained, good luck spending right then and there.

Are you referring to application settings or phone settings?
The iPhone has always let you deny apps access to personal info so there you can do that. Android only recently added support for this. Prior to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, you either gave full access or you just don't install the app.
If you're referring to an app settings, then irony of such a setting is that you are still trusting the app actually not access your personal info if it already has the need to access the info encoded into the application manifest. And for everyone still concerned about Airbitz accessing personal info, reminder that we are open source for people to audit and see that their personal info never leaves the device unless it's encrypted with their password which we don't have.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:10:02
2FA is only useful for authenticating yourself to a 3rd party. Multibit doesn't have any 3rd party you authenticate with. The password in Multibit is an encryption key and can't be 2FA'ed. 
Note that Airbitz is a hybrid solution that both encrypts your keys with a hash of your password but also uses a different password hash to authenticate with Airbitz server. This allows you to recover your encrypted data in case of a lost or damaged device by using your password. In such a case, 2FA is a very useful and recommended security measure. I'd recommend enabling it if you use Airbitz as a wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:47:06

Mycelium is secure so long as you don't:
1. Get malware that is looking for private keys in the phone's storage

Bitcoin seems volatile. Is it safe to invest?
*Investing is never safe. But that doesn't mean people won't do it. Invest based on your risk tolerance. I'm not an advisor, but many financial-types say 1-5% of liquid assets into bitcoin is reasonable*
I'm trying out a site called CardForCoin. Is it secure?

*That is the original implementation of Bitcoin but it requires the entire 20+ gb blockchain to get downloaded on your computer. As a new user, I'd steer clear if you just want to transact. I'd recommend a mobile wallet as your mobile device is likely your most secure platform right off the bat*
Is it possible to buy Bitcoin with PayPal?

Use a wallet that adds encryption before your private keys EVER touch the storage on your phone. Give Airbitz a try. All keys and user data are always encrypted and always backed-up. No extra steps.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:25:36
The sign up process needs to be greatly simplified. And I'd much rather not give my email address. 
I've always thought that forcing users to write down a 12 word passphrase was pretty foreign and inhibiting of mass adoption. With Ninki, you make them do it twice! And use a hard password AND confirm an email. 
Way too much friction in starting a new wallet. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:07:01
The username and password are the keys to encrypt your Bitcoin private keys as well as a way to authenticate with servers to backup and recover your data.
The "centralized" service is actually a bend of the truth since Bitcoin.org doesn't have a proper category for what Airbitz does. Airbitz accesses many different public Bitcoin nodes running Electrum and Libbitcoin servers. Some are owned by Airbitz but most are public. Airbitz doesn't use the SPV model yet but it definitely doesn't rely on purely centralized servers.
You can actually login to Airbitz and send out your money even if our servers were 100% down. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 17:04:49
Very true. Hence the importance of backing up the keys or using a wallet that automatically backs them up for you.
@_date: 2016-05-12 04:45:54
If you are willing to trust an app setting, then you can trust us when we say that the personal info never leaves the phone and no one sees the info but yourself. 
There has been a misconception that an app accessing personal info means that the company behind the app accesses it too. 
That misconception is understandable given many companys' desires to hoard user data. But it's not true of Airbitz
We're trying to usher in a world of zero knowledge apps that keep your info fully private while giving the user experience people have come to expect from our socially connected applications. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 07:03:03
2FA token recovery is tricky. If Green Address can't verify that you are the account holder, then technically they "shouldn't" reset 2FA.
The way we handle a 2FA reset on Airbitz is by requiring the username and password AND a 7 day wait before a reset will occur. During that time, any devices the user had logged into will get daily warning notifications in case of a fraudulent reset request. This allows for a fully private implementation of 2FA (no email or phone number required) while still allowing for an objective, impartial reset request.
So far, feedback on this method has been pretty positive. I'd urge GA to consider this option as well.
Here's a vid on how our 2FA works. Feedback welcome and encouraged.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:34:34
On Airbitz, you simply enable 2FA in settings and you're done!
Never have to copy and paste 6 digit codes. We basically took Google Authenticator and built it into the app. Since we're only a mobile app we streamlined the copy of that 6 digit code from Authy/Google Authenticator/text msg app and we have the app do it for you inside Airbitz. No external app needed.
@_date: 2015-03-01 06:48:17
Thanks for the Airbitz recommendation, Andreas. if you don't wanna deal with encryption and backup and just want a very functional wallet, give Airbitz a try.

Airbitz is a hot wallet and targets the usage case of everyday spending. I am constantly looking for and evaluating cold/Multisig solutions for us to use and recommend to other people. Problem has been that all current solutions have significant barriers to adoption for the average user and hence I haven't been able to recommend anything. I'd love to see a solution that I can personally recommend as this is critical for bitcoin adoption. If I seem critical of solutions, it's because I truly want better, easier, more familiar products to help this industry. Therefore I will call out implementations that don't meet that criteria. I expect other people and companies to do the same of Airbitz. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:11:57

Here's a copy of a post I made to someone else about Coinbase and Circle types of accounts:
Hosted Bitcoin accounts like Coinbase and Circle can't ever be good spending wallets. For security, they hold most user funds offline so just a handful of people spending their money will drain the shared hot wallet making wallets unspendable to everyone else. This makes for a VERY bad user experience for bitcoin and has caused us to lose users.
I myself have had a Coinbase transaction take 45min, 2hr, 4, and 18hrs to hit the network. Talking to Tony Gallippi from Bitpay, he says most of their support calls come from users using hosted wallets like Circle and Coinbase and expired invoices due to those wallets not sending funds out immediately. Why do you think there are no hosted wallets on their list of recommended wallets? They even explicitly do NOT recommend Coinbase.
If you want the familiarity and ease of use of a hosted wallet, but the ability to own your keys and send money immediately, give Airbitz a try.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:06:00
Agreed. Although mass adoption is severely hampered when you tell people they have to write down 12 random words and keep that safe. It's a new model that most are not accustomed to. 
The idea of 'backing up' your money is weird, foreign, and cumbersome. Also, once payment channels take off, a 12 word seed won't be enough. Wallets will have to backup actual data per transaction to retain funds. Most wallets can't currently do that although Airbitz is full prepared for it with peer-to-peer encrypted storage built in.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:25:30
I think if you look deeper beyond the anonymous trolls on reddit such as this person above, you'll find that Airbitz is pretty reputable company with strong visibility in the community, meetups, conferences. Just because I have a different opinion behind what defines consensus rules doesn't mean that I'm a liar. Note that most of the leading mobile light-client wallets share the same stance that I do regarding the "strongest chain"
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:27:11
I'm not saying encryption is fool proof, but it DOES help. A malicious app has to target the very specific memory footprint and behavior of an encrypted wallet vs just swiping all of storage and sending it off. Memory is much harder to compromise than storage. It's temporary, content location is non-deterministic, and access to it is much more restricted in general.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:01:13
Yes Airbitz can connect to a trusted node if it is running Electrum on top of the bitcoind software.

$.50 is about the minimum fee you're going to pay right now for a bitcoin transaction to have a decent amount of confidence that it will confirm in a reasonable amount of time (60 mins or so).
Note this fee chart from 21.co
A fee in the range of 120-140 satoshis per byte will get a confirmation in approximately 80 mins. To help you understand, a bitcoin transaction is at minimum about 230 bytes. At 130 sat/byte, that amounts to a fee of about 29,000 satoshis which is 0.290 mB which right now is about $0.44. That's for a fairly small transaction in bytes. Any larger and the fees go up. Note that the fees have NOTHING to do with how many bitcoin you are sending. It is related to the number of bytes of data.
Check out this FAQ for further details on how the byte size of a bitcoin transaction is determined

Airbitz uses 3rd party nodes and servers to send money. We do use public Libbitcoin nodes to query the blockchain. Those nodes happen to be ours right now due to a version mismatch. However, several new non-Airbitz nodes are coming online in the next few days. This will mean the wallet can fully function for receiving even if Airbitz goes down. We'll be submitting an update to bitcoin.org immediately after.
@_date: 2015-03-16 05:44:01
Hello and thanks for your feedback. The username and password are used for two things:
1. To encrypt your keys on your phone so that a stolen phone won't have accessible, unencrypted keys
2. To synchronize the encrypted data with our peer to peer servers. Yes that does mean data leaves your phone, but only after it has been encrypted by your password, not ours. Neither we, nor even any MITM attacker, will have ANY capability of decrypting your data. In fact, so much of your account is hashed and encrypted, that we cannot even associate your hashed username/password to the encrypted data-store.
Note that even if all Airbitz servers go down, you can still login into your account with your username &amp; password. Try it. Go into airplane-mode then login (not PIN login) with your full username &amp; password. That will simply decrypt the data on your phone.
In addition, just because we utilize a username &amp; password doesn't mean all communications go through our servers. To send or receive a transaction, the Airbitz app communicates directly with peer to peer nodes running open source Libbitcoin. Unlike Mycelium in which ALL bitcoin network communications go through ONLY their closed source, proprietary servers.
The reason we've chosen a username/password is because it is by far the most familiar experience that 99% of the population is accustomed to and won't be alienated by. I've come across tons of new users that get lost as soon as they're told to write down a 12 word passphrase and keep that secure. Then to "login" to another device, they have type in those same 12 words! 
Airbitz also allows users to tag transactions with rich meta data such as Payee, Category, and Notes. All of which is local, client-side encrypted for full privacy and then synchronized with the peer-to-peer data servers and then onto the user's other devices. All of which is enabled by the username &amp; password for authentication and encryption.
We've effectively mimic'ed a mobile banking app to make bitcoin 'feel' familiar to users while still retaining the core principles of decentralization, privacy, and financial autonomy.
Please see our FAQ which helps outline some of these details  
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:05:13
The process will be similar to Coinbase. You'll have to provide KYC info such as name, address, photo ID, SSN, and bank info to pull money from. Once verified you can buy and sell bitcoin directly from/to your Airbitz wallet. No need to transfer from Coinbase to a real, user controlled, wallet. All buys/sells are non-custodial. They go directly from USD bank to your Airbitz private keys (which you control), or from your Airbitz funds to USD in your bank.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:21:15
Note that Mycelium is not encrypting your private keys on the phone's storage. Hence if a provider like Tmobile wanted to pull files off your phone, they could get access to your funds. 
This does provide a more seamless ease of use experience as users don't need to login or decrypt their data--faster access to the wallet.
A wallet like [Airbitz]( only saves encrypted data to your phone's storage so even if your storage is compromised, your private keys are kept secure. It may take a few extra seconds to get into your account but that's the tradeoff for increased security.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:06:32

Airbitz does let you change the fees. Tap on the bitcoin fee amount in the send confirmation screen and you can then select Low, Standard, or High. 
Note that the default setting of Airbitz uses the network recommended fees for a confirmation between 2-5 blocks. This is not generally considered a "really high amount" except for the fact that fees are generally expensive now
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:43:21
Try Airbitz. You can set a password of your own level of difficulty. If you don't like PIN based security then disable PIN login in the settings. Just DO NOT forget your password as that's what needed to login and recovery your account if you lose your phone.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:57:04
Give Airbitz a try. Many consider it the most secure but newb friendly wallet. It's fully user controlled like breadwallet and only you control your private keys. 
And you can buy Bitcoin in Canada and many US states integrated in the wallet. It automatically goes from the exchange to your wallet. No need to transfer from Coinbase. 
And best part is, a simple username and password is all you need and your wallet is fully encrypted, backed up, and recoverable on any iOS or Android device.

It just isn't there yet for usability for the 99% of people. Doesn't mean you shouldn't use it if you are capable. 
Re: location info, you can simply deny access to the location info and the wallet will still function. And even with the location info, no personal info is every associated with your account. It is just a side query to the merchant directory server.

Tx malleability issues can be partly alleviated but not eliminated without protocol changes. We put in a couple changes into Airbitz to help. These are in Android 1.6.0 (in the Play Store now) and iOS 1.6.2 (available through beta TestFlight). If you have an iOS device, feel free to email us for an iOS beta.
1. Notice duplicated transactions (malleated transactions) and keep track of both for confirmation status.
2. Do not spend from unconfirmed malleated transactions. Note that it's possible for a transaction to get malleated after you've spent funds from it.
Hope this helps.

It's possible your transaction required a lot of inputs and became a very large (in kilobytes) size transaction.
Also, if you happen to send an amount which creates a small amount of "dust" change output, then that could cause a very low priority transaction.
What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:59:09
The data connection is needed to backup your encrypted data including encrypted private keys. We make sure that before an account/wallet can be used, it's been backed up on multiple (5 actually) separate peer to peer servers. I've heard too many stories of people losing funds because they didn't "backup their money" which is a VERY foreign concept in our world. After account creation, no data connection is needed to login with your username/password. PIN login does need our servers since it is server assisted for security. Try it out. Login using your full username/password while in airplane mode.

You'll need Airbitz on a smart phone to get the funds. Ask a friend to install Airbitz and sweep the funds and you can then have him send it to a desktop wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:00:59
Please consider trying Airbitz on ios or Android. We're likely the easiest wallet to secure for the average new user. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:14:10
Yes, Airbitz ( is actively looking at it. Challenge is that tumbling isn't cheap, and it is slow given that you need other players on the network to join in. It's just no reasonable to ask users to wait until there are enough people joined in a coinjoin type of tumble. Better to do it in the background with some set small % of the user's funds. This is easy on Android but harder on iOS since you don't get a chance to run in the background arbitrarily. Rest assured we do want to do this. Just need time and resources.
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:34:34
As mentioned, malware is likely the biggest concern and with desktops the average person is installing software from anywhere and going through minimal malware detection through a cheap virus scanner that runs for &lt;1s on each app install.  This is even worse on browsers as people install browser extensions that have full access to all webpages they visit. I'm predicting that mobile will be the future of bitcoin wallets as the app sandboxing and significant malware detection run on app store/play store applications far exceeds what consumers run on their own. Yes, people can get Tails, and boot from a clean CD, but this is not likely to be accepted by the masses.

And per the OBPP app privacy rankings, even with those permissions requested, Airbitz scored the highest in privacy for an Android wallet and  for iOS. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:48:45
Attackers might at any time have a reason to DDOS a service. Including Airbitz. However, for the sake of the concern mentioned by the OP, we don't utilize a centralized DDOS prevention service like Cloudflare. We instead try to decentralize as much of our system as possible. Access to the bitcoin network is through p2p, open source libbitcoin nodes. Our encrypted storage servers are also 100% p2p using the Git protocol. While not claiming to be 100% bullet proof, I'm convinced decentralization is a better route to DDOS resistance than centralized services such as Cloud Flare.

The location info is used to lookup nearby businesses in the merchant directory. This is for the functionality of the directory by itself and to help autocomplete transaction info after a send or receive. The business directory query is not associated with any account info.

I've said this to people hundreds of times.. Hosted Bitcoin accounts like Coinbase and Circle can't ever be good spending wallets. For security, they hold most user funds offline so just a handful of people spending their money will drain the shared hot wallet making wallets unspendable to everyone else. This makes for a VERY bad user experience for bitcoin and has caused us to lose users. 
I myself have had a Coinbase transaction take 45min, 2hr, 4, and 18hrs to hit the network. Talking to Tony Gallippi from Bitpay, he says most of their support calls come from users using hosted wallets like Circle and Coinbase and expired invoices due to those wallets not sending funds out immediately. Why do you think there are no hosted wallets on their list of recommended wallets. They even do NOT recommend Coinbase. 
If you want the familiarity and ease of use of a hosted wallet, but the ability to own your keys and send money immediately, give Airbitz a try.
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:37:54
If you had paid 5c then the transaction would have never confirmed. 
The low vs high issue is really dependent on your frame of reference. In bitcoin the frame of reference is not relative to conventional payment methods. It never can be because the cost of a conventional payment method has no bearing on the cost needed  to confirm a bitcoin transaction. 
Low vs high is relative to the normal default of the wallet. This is true for all bitcoin wallets. You can probably set "low" on any wallet and you'll get what you would consider a high fee to send $10. That's unfortunately the current state of bitcoin at this moment due to the blocksize issues.

Airbitz can sweep non-encrypted private keys from QR codes or even pasted from the clipboard or from an image in your photo-album.

One of the simplest wallets to secure is Airbitz. Give it a try. Simple username &amp; password will auto-encrypt and auto-backup your keys and data and sync them between your devices with end-to-end encryption. No one has control of  
your keys but you and you get uber high privacy. No name, address, or phone number needed. Wallet even works if Airbitz servers go down since it can access the bitcoin network directly.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:42:37
The Airbitz wallet has an integrated business directory that is supported and curated in 15 countries. 
Give it a try and send us feedback. Companies like Bitpay are looking to automatically add their new merchants directly into our wallet's directory. We hope to have that working in a couple months from now. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:23:50
Be aware that by holding your funds in Coinjar that you are effectively using a bank. Coinjar controls 100% of your bitcoin and they can be:
1. seized or frozen
2. fully tracked (no privacy)
3. restricted in who you can send to (Coinbase in the US already does this)
4. fractional reserved
Get a real wallet where you own the private keys. ie. Airbitz, Breadwallet, or Mycelium

It will only take a week if you lose your phone and don't have other devices that you've logged into. During the reset process, Airbitz sends a notification to previously logged in devices warning of the 2FA reset in case of fraud. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:41:28
Admittedly the verification process can be daunting. This has been a limitation of our partner, Glidera, and we have no control over that process. I apologize.
With respect to basic functionality of send/receive of bitcoin from another wallet, there are two big buttons when you first login, [Request] and [Send]. 
Request shows your address as a QR code which can be scanned by another wallet and a button to Copy if you needed to get the address into another app.
Send allows you to scan another QR code to send money to or enter the address manually ([Address] button). These are the basics of bitcoin and we try to put them front and center as soon as you're logged in. Let us know if there was some part of this process that was unclear in the app, or if it is the general way of using bitcoin that may have stumbled you.

Airbitz. You'll never have your funds held by a third party. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:14:08
Per the App details for Airbitz:
********* Privacy Notice *********
The Airbitz application requests access to the device contact list, location, and personal information. This information is used on the device to provide an improved user experience in the following ways:
1. Autocomplete contacts from the user's address book after a transaction
2. Autocomplete contacts from the user's address book to send Email or SMS payment requests
3. Autocomplete business listings names after a transaction
4. Geolocate user's device to find nearby businesses
No personal info or contact list info ever leaves the device without first being encrypted by the user's credentials (username/password). Neither Airbitz nor any 3rd party can access the information requested by the application.
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:22:22
With Airbitz you can simply take a screenshot of that QR code then choose that photo to scan from within Airbitz. Just go to the Send screen, tap on the photo icon, then choose a photo from your gallery. Done :)
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:23:48
You don't lose access to funds if Airbitz goes down. You can actually login to your account on your phone without any Airbitz servers so long as you've logged into that phone before. All that's happening is decryption of the data already on your phone. The 2FA basically restricts access from other devices even if an attacker already has your username and password. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:40:09
Here's a great 3rd party overview and architectural/security review of Airbitz: 
@_date: 2017-07-03 01:31:18
What part of Airbitz do you not understand how to use? I'm happy to help.
If you're in the US (anywhere but NY) you should be able to Buy bitcoin right from within the app by linking any major US bank account. This goes through our partner Glidera/Kraken. Once bitcoin is purchased, it ends up directly in your wallet. No need to transfer it out of an exchange like Coinbase.
Just tap "Buy Bitcoin" on the main screen to get started.

It would be very difficult for someone to access your Airbitz wallet by trying to brute force your password. A very strong hash of the password is used to authenticate to Airbitz to download the encrypted bundle of keys but the server has rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. In addition you can, and are encouraged to enable 2FA so that even if an attacker had your exact password, they couldn't access your account without your device.
In addition, the use of a password allows a user to gradually scale from the low complexity of a 10 digit password to a 24 random word seed like a hardware wallet. One could always choose a password that IS 12-24 random words, then you'd have a cryptographically secure random password. But since the password is not THE bitcoin private key but rather just rate limited server authentication and a decryption key, a much lower entropy password like 3-4 random words, can be VERY VERY secure and nearly impossible to brute force while at the same time being very memorable for the average user.

James D'Angelo has awesome videos. Highly recommended

Check out Airbitz. Looks great to me. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:16:24
Sorry for the late reply. Our rationale is that 99% of the population with smart phones are accustomed to a username/password combo. People have NEVER had to "backup" their money and especially not by writing down 12 word pass-phrases. This is a VERY new, unfamiliar, and intimidating paradigm for a financial application. As a bitcoin evangelist, I've lost several, would-be, bitcoiners because the process of backing up their keys scared them.
People are accustomed to having a username &amp; password which they can use on multiple devices as if they were logging into mobile banking. We've delivered the familiar feel of mobile banking while retaining true bitcoin decentralization.
We believe VERY strongly in decentralization. If you ever hear my talks, you'll know I'm a firm believer. But I also know you have to deliver it in a way that will get people to use decentralization even if they don't care about it. SPV is coming to Libbitcoin this year, and Airbitz will be incorporating it then. In the meantime, we at least utilize multiple, independent, Libbitcoin-Server (open source, public) nodes to do transaction verification. There is no one server or DNS entry an attacker can compromise and guarantee to compromise the transaction verification of our users.
I know many people have concerns over online backups. Especially with the many hacks of encrypted data from wallets like BC.info. Our data model is such that even with online backups, we disassociate users hashed usernames/passwords from their encrypted data to significantly increase privacy &amp; security. If someone knew you used Airbitz and had 100% full access to our servers, they still wouldn't know where to try and brute force your account. We don't hold any unencrypted user data, including public addresses, to retain that security.
And to further secure data, we implement dynamically tuned, scrypt password hashing running in native C++ code on Android &amp; iOS to achieve the strongest hashing/encryption possible on a mobile device. Orders of magnitude stronger than any wallet that runs on a browser, doing encryption in Javascript. And the encryption key is the user's password which is stored in their head. With Breadwallet, the encryption key is created in the factory by Apple and placed in their secure hardware chip. It sounds like a great solution, but understand that your private keys are being encrypted with a key that lives on the same device. That's like putting the key to your house under the dirt of your front yard. A stolen phone has the potential to have encrypted data ripped out and decrypted should a weakness to the iPhone secure storage be found.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:39:23
The user's device always holds an encrypted copy of the private keys which they can access even if Airbitz goes down. You can test this by simply going into Airplane mode and then logging in with your full password (not PIN).
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:30:58
You should be able to just enter a 4 digit PIN to re-login to Airbitz. There's a current bug in v 1.4.3 that breaks PIN login if you logged in with a capital letter or space in your username. Just relogin w/o the space or capital letter. It will still work, and PIN login will work as well. Will be fixed in next version
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:56:22
In addition, Airbitz lets you choose which nodes you'd like to connect to in the case of a chain split/fork. See this blog post for details:
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:54:33
But I would highly recommend giving [Airbitz]( a try. If you end up using Bitcoin a lot, it's got a lot of ease of use functionality that's missing from every other wallet. Plus you can access your wallet concurrently from multiple iOS or Android devices using just a username/password and it's fully private. You own the private keys. Feels like mobile banking but with real bitcoin functionality.
And unlike most wallets mentioned here, it doesn't use proprietary servers to access the bitcoin network. Airbitz uses open source, public, libbitcoin nodes which increases privacy and reliability. Please let us know how you like it.

I definitely carry more than $500. I frequently buy plane tickers with bitcoin, and $500 doesn't always cut it. I don't usually hold $500 in my leather wallet, but I think a physical wallet is way LESS secure than a mobile hot wallet. If your mobile wallet is encrypted and backed up then the risk from loss or theft is far less worrisome than with a mobile wallet. Especially if you are only installing software thats been decently vetted by an app store, and on a phone with good sandboxing of apps, like iOS.

You make it sound like getting 75% is easy. Like any miner can just do it. If miners wanted to make 21 million more coins and got 75%, they would have made that decision with community feedback, not in a vacuum. POW makes that change very difficult and the community threatening to leave bitcoin and drop the bitcoin value keeps miners in check. But in the end, the miners decide. Hashing power is the only measurable vote. Everyone else just influences them.

It's generally best practice to keep private keys encrypted on any device that holds them. Especially if they are single signature keys. Most mobile wallets give the option of encrypting keys or do it by default. Not to overstate the obvious, but use a strong but memorable password for encryption. 4-8 digits PINs as encryption passwords are easily cracked even with the strongest of hashing algorithms.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:43:45
Note that [Airbitz]( provides the simplest, most secure, encrypted, and most familiar method of distributed storage for a bitcoin wallet. Users don't have to be concerned with 12 word passphrases and securing a physical piece of paper. Private keys, meta data, and other account info is encrypted, local, client-side and synchronized on peer-to-peer git nodes and onto any other devices the user may have. It's most familiar usage case for a bitcoin wallet for anyone who has used mobile banking while still letting users have 100% control of their funds w/ no 3rd party access.
@_date: 2015-02-20 07:10:37
We've been chatting about this feature and have a few proposals we want to run by you. We're still a bit concerned about opening the flood gates and letting the wallet spend unconfirmed funds with no restrictions. 
For the use case of educating new users, would it be sufficient to allow the first (or first 3) spend transactions in an account to access unconfirmed funds? That way new users can easily spend their first bitcoin, but it teaches them that future transactions *really* should have a confirmation before being accepted.
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:56:55

@_date: 2015-02-17 22:38:08
Thanks for the feedback We've thought hard about the ability to spend unconfirmed funds. It walks a tricky line. Funds might be spendable, but as double spend attacks get more widespread, merchant processors might start 'not' accepting spends from unconfirmed funds. So that coffee your friend might buy might end up showing as not received by the merchant for an hour.
In our minds, it's better to not be able to spend the funds immediately, but when you can spend them, you have a high chance that they'll be accepted. What are your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:28:17

We have seen many small transactions with fees as high as $0.20 not confirm at all and get dropped from the network. With a $0.05 fee, it's not just about waiting a long time, it's also about getting lucky that miners quickly find several blocks one after the other and clear out the mempool faster than it is being filled.

Don't recommend hosted wallets at all since they are unreliable for sending out your money, they kill your privacy, restrict who you can send to, and defeat the purpose of bitcoin's decentralization. 
Hold your money in a real wallet where you control the keys. Try Airbitz for simplicity and functionality. Green Address for extra Multisig security, and offline storage like Armory, Trezor, or Ledger for your larger funds.

@_date: 2015-02-24 16:48:06
The keys are stored on the phone. But they aren't encrypted. The PIN you use is just app behavior preventing the app from allowing someone in. But a dump of the phone's storage will show the keys with a small amt of digging. 
Even if they did encrypt, a 6 digit PIN is easily cracked in a matter of seconds with a brute force attack on any computer. 
Yes, you 'can' backup your wallet, but it's not automatic. Many have fallen into this hole as they've used the wallet without first backing it up. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:52:14
As a wallet for both personal and merchant use, Airbitz is a good choice. One big feature of Airbitz is partial payment detection. You punch in an amt to collect. If the buyer pays you a smaller amt, the app will popup saying it was a partial payment then generate a new QR code with the remaining balance. I don't believe any other wallet does this aside from merchant processors. 
Airbitz also lets you have 2 or more wallets in an account and name them as business or personal or whatever you want. 
If you needed employees to collect money from customers, you can create an account with spending limits to limit their ability to send out funds. 
And of course, the transaction tagging will make it sooo much easier to know what all your transaction were for.

Keep that in mind when accessing wallets off the web. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:08:28
Airbitz. You can send your money even if Airbitz servers go down. The wallet connects to multiple APIs and nodes to send money so you are not reliant on any one company or service to send/receive bitcoin. Not true of many popular wallets including all the ones mentioned so far on this thread.
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:19:11

By brute force, do you mean
1. Brute forcing a private key from a public key?
2. Brute forcing someone's password on a website?
3. Brute forcing someone's encryption password?
1. Would take longer than your lifetime and your kids, and their kids lifetime
2. Depends on the complexity of the password and how well the server rate limits incorrect tries
3. Depends on what type of password hashing is used for encryption. SHA1/SHA256 passwords are known to be easily broken. Scrypt or other memory hard algorithms do FAR FAR better in protecting the user.
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:47:31
Keep your bitcoin encrypted and backed up if your wallet doesn't do that for you. I recommend a mobile wallet for spending (smallish) funds. Your mobile device is likely 10x more secure than your desktop. For long term, high value storage, look into hardware wallets and offline devices. But play with them using a small amount first before committing a large amt. As new user, you probably shouldn't be buying enough bitcoin to *need* a hardware wallet just yet
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:32:27
The word list backup is very safe on Mycelium. Cryptographically hard to brute force. The risk with the wallet is physical theft. Since the private keys are not encrypted on the device, a thief could easily rip out the keys and use them. I try not to quote fiat/btc amounts that you should keep on a wallet like that. I'd rather say that I'd keep a fraction of a percent of your liquid assets on it. Enough for a couple small purchases.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:44:50
There is still value add in a wallet that encrypts your keys and backs them up automatically. Writing down a 12 word passphrase, while acceptable to many, is unfamiliar to 99.9% of the population. We are used to a login &amp; password. On vacation and lose your phone? Use the login &amp; password to get back access to your money on another phone.

Agreed. Neither biometrics or a PIN are ever sufficient to prevent someone from cracking into encrypted data. Unless you have at least entered a decent entropy, full password, assume that you data on the device can be compromised if the device is compromised. 
I believe Apple assists in the security by putting the decryption key for the PIN login &amp; Touch ID inside a hardware enclave. That's better but the decryption key is still in the phone vs in your head. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:41:01
I'm sorry you had that experience with your wallet file. Wallet software has advanced tremendously since plain old Bitcoin QR/Core. Encryption and autobackups are already common on many platforms which would have saved you. If you feel that I've been biased just from being a wallet company founder, then I still urge you to use a real wallet like Mycelium, Breadwallet, or even Blockchain.info.
I'm not saying that Coinjar IS doing any of the above. But the fact is they *can*. And worse yet, governments can force them to. And that is the root of most of the banking system issues. Once we need to put trust in a central party then we've lost 90+% of the benefit of bitcoin. The issues might not yet manifest themselves, but I promise you they will.

Although it was quick and smooth. This type of setup requires a lot of trust on the side of the merchant. Without a device they are 100% trusting the customer to have actually sent an appropriate amount of funds.

I would transfer some to a mobile wallet. I biased'ly recommend Airbitz. Great spending wallet as you can easily tag what you spent money on. Plus it's got Fold integrated for 10-20% off Starbucks and up to 10% off Target. And you can easily replenish spent Bitcoin with integration with the Glidera exchange. 
All with the  ranked cross platform mobile wallet for privacy by the OBPP.

Give Airbitz a try. Not a lot of complex steps. Create a username &amp; password and you're done. Account is auto-encypted and auto-backed up. 
Break your phone? No problem. Same username and password can access funds on another phone. Lose your phone? No problem. Data is very strongly encrypted to protect against hacking attempts.
All in a true, decentralized bitcoin wallet that can even function if Airbitz servers are down.
Starts to feel like Coinbase &amp; Circle? I'd say even better. No email, phone number, or any other personal info to give out. New accounts setup takes maybe 2 mins. Coinbase &amp; Circle will take you 10 with all the info you need to give.

Yeah. Spurlock would've had a much easier time using Airbitz to find merchants :)

If you want a similar wallet to Blockchain.info but with significantly improved ease of use, give Airbitz a try. 100% mobile, a simple login/password will create your HD wallet, encrypt your keys, backup your keys, and sync across multiple devices. No pairing with websites or writing down 12 words. App can even function if Airbitz goes down. Significantly stronger encryption too. Disclaimer:I am an Airbitz founder, but I did build it to address the problems you faced with other wallets. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:27:51
I don't know of many but thanks for the push on this. We're strongly considering it for Airbitz now

I've heard several people state that they've created tens of thousands of wallets on BC.info. It would be interesting to know how many are active and by how many unique IP addresses. It could be a huge bullish sign for bitcoin if there really are even half this many active users.

If you're worried about malware, be wary of any wallet that has you write down your private seed to back it up. A screen grabber would instantly have your funds. If you have to type it in to get access on a new device or to "verify" your backup, then a key logger would also have your funds. 
Lastly, make sure the wallet keeps your keys encrypted on the device. A lot of malware will sweep the contents of your device and send it out for the attacker to sift through.

They have established a name as an early player in the bitcoin space. Search for "Bitcoin wallet" and that's what you'll see. However there are many better wallets out there that just haven't achieved the SEO that Blockchain gained by being around for 3 years. I credit them for being early innovators in the space. However, bitcoin has evolved and the other wallets have evolved past them at this point.  I'd check out other solutions. Ie Green Address or Copay for Multisig, Airbitz for privacy, ease of use, and functionality, Breadwallet for absolute autonomy.

This is a common problem I've experienced w hosted wallets. 
I've experienced sends take anywhere from 45 mins to 18 hours to get broadcasted. This is a nearly unfixable long term problem with hosted wallets. Since they necessarily hold most funds in cold storage, a "run" on their hot wallet can cause huge delays in spending while they reload the from cold storage. 
Hence the reason you shouldn't use hosted wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:31:03
Definitely give Airbitz a try if you are using multiple devices. You can do any number of transactions on one device and they automatically sync onto the other. Including all the meta data you add such as Payee, Category, and Notes. Just a login and password on each device will sync and decrypt your account. It's also 100% private and only you control your keys. And unlike most other wallets, the keys are encrypted on your device automatically. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 05:00:40
Give Airbitz a try. Fully user controlled private keys, always encrypted, automatically backed up. Full privacy. Rich functionality GUI like no other wallet has. Transaction tagging, integrated buy/sell, TouchID, and much more.

Super thanks for the feedback. We put the QR code on the second screen as almost all financial apps that people are accustomed to have the process of first entering an amount to request, then continuing with the request. Not that they are a shining example of great UI, but Circle and Coinbase work this way also. 
It's much more common for a merchant interface. Also, the [Next] button is when we generate a new, unique, HD address for that transaction.
We tried to fit the QR in the 1st screen, but it made a VERY tight squeeze. And it was more awkward for the use case of requesting a specific amt.
Maybe we were thinking too much of the merchant use case and how it applies to our app. We'll continue to think of a better balance to this use case.
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:57:49
Both are good wallets. Mycelium has the advantage of your keys ONLY existing on your phone. However Mycelium also does not encrypt the keys or back them up. A stolen phone can mean easily stolen funds. Airbitz encrypts keys before they are saved on the phone. Then they are auto backed up in case the phone is lost. 
Airbitz also has the great feature of rich transactional meta data you can add to each transaction, such as payee, category, fiat value, and notes. All info is private, encrypted, backed up, and synchronized. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:08:37

Copay's security is rooted in using Multisig. You would need at least 3 devices each having a 2 of 3 key and then you'd have a super secure environment. 
You would need to have two of the devices to sign each transaction. 
If you want an easy yet secure single device solution, give Airbitz a try. Enable 2FA with a good password and you'll be solid.
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:43:43
The most common type of malware a user will get on their phone is a key logger or screen capture. Any app that shows you your private key and requires you to back it up by writing it down is VERY susceptible to theft. This is ironically the most common form of wallet backup. 
A better alternative is a wallet the stores keys on the device encrypted at all times with credentials ONLY the user has, and it auto backs it up and syncs it across their devices. Add 2FA to this solution and key loggers and screen caps are defeated. 
With the prevalence of custom keyboards now on both iOS and Android, do we really want people typing private keys into their apps?
Marshmallow or not, this is a huge security hole in many current wallets
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:55:04
To the best of my knowledge, the 12 word seed in bread wallet is non-standard. There may be tools to use this seed outside of breadwallet but I'm not aware of them. Airbitz uses a standard bip32 master private key however this isn't utilized by many wallets either. You can put this master private key/seed into the wallet recovery app and extract all the individual private keys if needed. 
You can get access to the recovery app on  or using the github repo
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:22:53
Airbitz allows you to specify a fiat currency for each wallet in your account. Then each transaction in that account will get tagged with the fiat value at the time of the transaction. Transactions can also be tagged with Payee, Category, and Notes, and the fiat value can be edited at any time and also exported to a CSV which you can give to an accountant.
All of this is done fully anonymous as all the data is encrypted client side but then backed up on our peer to peer network. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:44:07
Awesome. Note that also for the average user, Airbitz auto backs up the keys. So even if you lose your phone or keys, you can get a new phone and use your login and password to download and decrypt your keys on the new phone.

[Airbitz]( keeps it super simple (and familiar) to create a wallet. A username &amp; password and that wallet is auto encrypted, backed up, and concurrently accessible from multiple iPhone and Android devices. All with uber privacy and users fully owning their private keys.

Desktop and especially web platforms are incredibly prone to malware, and are the worst platforms to hold a bitcoin hot wallet. Keep your hot funds on a mobile device and your large funds in cold storage.

Happy to answer some of your questions:
Edge holds all of your keys encrypted on your phone. If Edge were to go away, you could always decrypt the keys using biometric or your full password as long as you still have your device which was previously logged into. The app also accesses blockchain networks using public nodes or multiple third-party APIs. Therefore you can actually send and receive funds even without Edge servers.
The private keys for each wallet can be viewed by the user by tapping on the three dots to the right of each wallet and tapping master private key.
Note that each wallet has its own master private key so viewing one does not give you access to the funds of all wallets in the account
Also, the most recent and updated white paper is at this link below.
Disclaimer: I am a cofounder of edge
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:49:37
You'll notice that after a new account asks for a PIN, the password screen has a [Skip] button if you don't type anything into the password fields. The app will then give the user a daily reminder to add a password which is needed to backup the wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:06:45
Target is already available and supported through Airbitz. It's directly integrated into the wallet along w/Starbucks so no need to verify payment addresses or supply refund addresses. It's all done for you in the background.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:45:23
Put in a solid password and you won't need to worry about the online storage. Many people on the forums actually backup their private key by putting it into an encrypted file then backing it up onto dropbox or google drive in case they lose their phone or their house burns down. Airbitz automates this process entirely plus it puts thousands of 'fake' wallets into the system so an attacker would have to brute force many more accounts before finding an account of any value.
Note as well that the password hashing on Airbitz is cranked quite high and even dynamically tuned to your device. The faster your phone, the stronger that hashing will be, and hence the harder it will be to brute force your account.
Here's a 3rd party review of the Airbitz security architecture. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:05:30
Call it what you will but our biggest set of support questions from the past two years has been from users asking how they could acquire and use their Bitcoin. 
We are simply addressing those questions and making it as seamless as possible for people to do those exact things. All within one app. Even Copay, which you rave about, integrates Glidera and unlike Airbitz, Copay bounces you out to your browser. Mycelium does the same thing with their Glidera integration. And expect that Bread will be incorporating such services soon. 
The Airbitz team worked extremely hard to make the experience with Glidera as integrated as possible. Same with the Fold integrated Starbucks and Target gift cards and we hope to do the same with Purse but are limited by their lack of APIs.
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:30:01
Note that Airbitz auto backs up your keys in encrypted form so you don't need to rely on iCloud. Plus it works cross platform so you can use your keys across iOS and Android. It also has TOTP built in that you enable with one touch in Settings. No extra app to use like Google Authenticator or Authy. And it allows for 2FA recovery via time based delay.

With Airibitz, keys are auto encrypted with a strong hash of your password and auto backed up. Lose your device, just enter your credentials on another phone? Add one-Touch two factor and youre protected against someone else who might find your password. 
It's quite resilient to malware as well as your keys are always encrypted on the device. Also, since you never have to show your private keys on screen, you're not susceptible to a screen grabber.

@_date: 2016-07-26 05:46:13
is correct. So long as you remember your username and password, you'll always be able to login to your account on a previously logged in device. In the chance that you lose the phone at the same time that Airbitz goes down, then keys would be lost. However, realize that even if Airbitz were to cease to exist, we can still temporarily provide access to servers that allow users to get to their accounts to make a seamless transition. So when you say "Airbitz goes under", that would have to mean that all our redundant server copies of user's encrypted data would have to become unavailable and destroyed. Not very likely, and highly unlikely at the same time that you lose your phone.
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:56:00
Not true. Airbitz on iOS and Android connects directly to bitcoin nodes running libbitcoin. These may not be the Bitcoin Core nodes but they are free, open source nodes holding the entire blockchain that anyone can run.

Airbitz leaves private keys in FULL control by the user. It's one of our primary core values. Own your keys. Own your money. 
Neither we nor any 3rd party can access funds. If govt wanted to subpoena us to freeze someone's funds, we give them our white paper instead.
Bitcoin was built for financial autonomy and privacy. We built Airbitz to achieve those goals.

Use a user-controlled wallet with integrated exchange services (ie. Airbitz/Glidera). Once you buy bitcoin it shows up in keys you control. No one can censor your transactions after that.
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:22:31
Disregarding BIP75, would collecting PII punish a wallet if all PII is only stored encrypted, zero-knowledge, with only the user able to access it? PII in a client-side encrypted wallet is very useful when a user wants to send the info to 3rd parties. It can auto-fill applications, forms, etc via protocols like BitID. Similar to Lastpass without the form filling guessing game.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:47:15
Airbitz is a deterministic, rolling address, BIP32 compliant wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:17:27
Note that Airbitz stores private keys on the phone fully encrypted. All account info is also encrypted including even the settings of the app. Malware on a rooted phone would have to get access to the app memory to hijack the private keys. Enable One-Touch 2FA and even a keylogger wouldn't be able to access your money.
@_date: 2015-02-19 05:12:25
Start small since cold storage is pretty complex right now. If you don't want to deal with *securing* your wallet and all those complexities, try Airbitz. It's probably the best security you can get in a hot wallet with minimal effort. Then take a small amount of bitcoin and play around with more secure storage such as Armory, Trezor, or Ledger. Once you feel comfortable with the offline solutions, go ahead and make larger purchases. And yes, stay away from using banks like Coinbase &amp; Circle to store and transact with. They are great buy/sell service and offer a promising multisig vault. Other than that, use a wallet where you own your money
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:49:13
The Glidera, Starbucks, and Target options are tight integrations with the wallet that are anything but advertisements. They seamlessly integrate the wallet with the ability to buy and store gift cards in the app. Please send any screenshots to support on how these are causing any popups on your phone browser. They should be isolated plugins.

Give us about 1-2 more days and Airbitz will have custom fee support in Android. We just launched the iOS version with custom fees and Android is following close behind.

Or just use a mobile or hardware wallet where phishing attacks don't work. Coinbase's insurance will only cover so many losses until they realize they have to make money on all those funds they *store* for people. They will either charge for that service or have to loan out the money. Once they loan money, welcome back to fractional reserve.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:27:48
The functionality is moderately hidden so people don't just stumble on it and we have some significant warnings when people see the popup. If anything it makes up for all the support tickets of people complaining about not being able to manually set their fees

Be sure to enable 2FA and have a strong password that isn't reused. If there is any chance you'll forget the password, then write it down or setup password recovery. Don't root/jailbreak your phone and you should be good.

A lite client does not inherently create any risk over a full node for securing large funds. It is only RECEIVING funds that is made more certain by a full node vs a lite client. If you can verify a confirmation using another source like a block explorer then you can have very strong confidence that money you've received in a lite wallet actually confirmed. 
For the sake of securing your funds over a longer term, I would claim that a full node wallet is actually more insecure as they require operation on a desktop. Even bitcoin.org classifies desktop wallets as running on an "insecure environment". Airbitz only runs on mobile which is a more secure, sandboxed environment. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:57:55
That's pretty damn good for security. The most important being the strong password. If you want even higher levels of security for large fund storage (call it luke-cold), you can disable PIN login, TouchID (if on iOS), set autologout to 1 min, and add a daily spending limit of 0 btc. This does trade convenience for security so I wouldn't recommend it for spending funds. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:59:22
It is not dependent on a 3rd party. Users can login to their wallet on their phone with their password even if Airbitz were down. They can send and receive funds from the wallet even if Airbitz were down. Airbitz is only a backup service to sync their encrypted keys to new devices. Once a user has logged into a device, the keys are stored there and usable without Airbitz services.

Blockchain.info app is available on iPhone. I just downloaded it a week ago. Has full wallet functionality and its not "really" a web wallet as you still own your keys, not blockchain. They just facilitate syncing the keys between devices. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:29:00
An encrypted copy of the keys are kept on our servers. Since they are encrypted, a compromise of our system would not necessarily get access to your funds. There is no personally identifiable info that can associate encrypted data to you or your public keys so an attacker wouldn't know which accounts have any value to even try to brute force your password. And we put blank accounts in our system that have no value to make it even harder to find valuable accounts. 
Coinbase on the other hand owns your keys 100%. They are a Bitcoin bank in every way. A compromise of Coinbase will absolutely compromise your coins. Just look at all the exchanges that have been hacked. 
Chose a strong password that isn't used on any websites and you'll be quite well off in Airbitz. 
Airbitz is the equivalent of encrypting your keys with a tool like TrueCrypt, then backing it up with BitTorrentSync and synchronizing it between your devices as well. But with all the complexity hidden from the user. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:08:23
Check out Airbitz. Unlike the "Bitcoin Wallet" or Mycelium, it actually encrypts and auto backs up your keys so if your phone is stolen, the theif will have a hell of a time trying to crack the encryption. It's a bit slower to get into the wallet initially but well worth it for the added security. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:18:12
Windows is a big factor, but so is 'desktop'. Desktop systems require users to install apps from many sources that haven't been vetted against malware the way app stores have been. Even linux can be very insecure if users install apps from random sites. Take KeyPass as an example.  Many people visit keypass.info to find a download link. Keypass.info isn't even on SSL/https. That site could be easily MITM'ed and a download link to a hacker's site could be injected.
Now the arguably most important app on your computer could be infected.
It's not that desktop *can't* be secure. It's just that normal behavior on desktop creates far more security risks than on mobile.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:19:16
Those are great way to buy bitcoin, but don't use them as a wallet as those companies fully control your keys. They're effectively a bank. Use a wallet where you control the private keys on your own device.

I would say the Coinbase app on Android but they're instant conversion to fiat does not work with their mobile app. I've emailed them about this issue but haven't received a response. I would recommend Bitpay like everyone else but they have a major UI flaw. Once you take a payment, they don't give you a button to return to the screen to take another payment. Idiotic. I've setup some businesses and they struggle with that issue.

Easiest way if you don't care about anonymity and you want to buy a small amt is to use coinbase.com. It may take awhile (week or so) but its simple to setup and you don't pay wire fees. After getting level 2 certified (give them complete personal info) you can make small instant buys and sells direct to your bank account. 
For wallets, I'd recommend blockchain.info. They have a decent app on all OSes (ios, android, Mac, pc, web) and they sync between all of them and also auto backup your wallet to email or google docs. 
If you happen to be in San Diego, I'd be happy to help in person.

There are currently no native applications on IOS for purchasing and selling bitcoin. Your best bet is to go to coinbase.com and do all of your dollar to bitcoin exchanging there. Then have coinbase transfer the coins to a wallet such as Blockchain.info which is an app you can use on iOS.
Transferring bitcoin out of Coinbase simply involves clicking the SEND button then copying and pasting your blockchain address into the coinbase "send to:" field.
Note that I highly recommend you create your Blockchain.info account on their website and not using the phone app. It's easy to create an account on the phone app but lose access to it by failing to create a login, password, and associated e-mail.
Good luck

I have been a huge fan of your iOS devices since the iPhone 3G and have owned every single generation of iPhone and iPad through the iPhone 5S. The last several weeks, your actions have forced me to buy an Android Nexus 7 tablet and recommend several other Android devices to others.
My wife, a well respected dentist here in San Diego ( decided to accept Bitcoin in store for her services. As we ran through the process, we realized that there were no good merchant [bitcoin] solutions for the iPhone or iPad. After reading many forum posts, it came to my attention that Apple has been refusing Bitcoin Apps from the App store. We decided that an Android device was the better option with its large installed base of Bitcoin apps. Many other businesses have approached me inquiring on how best to proceed to accept Bitcoin, and I have had to reluctantly recommend Android devices.
Your company is losing a lot of potential sales, not to mention the respect of hundreds of thousands of bitcoin users, by denying apps that clearly do not violate your terms of agreement on iOS. It has been reported that your basis of denial has been the legality of bitcoin transactions. Please view the Senate hearings on Bitcoin from Nov 18 where US officials clearly state that bitcoin use is NOT a violation of any laws. In addition, they agreed that the government must take care to not stifle this revolutionary technology.
As the community of bitcoin users grow, and they are growing exponentially, the value of your iOS devices diminishes at the same proportion.
Please reconsider your stance against bitcoin apps. I would like to think Apple can be more revolutionary minded than a handful of US Senators.
Thanks for listening.

Went to place an order, but it gave me nowhere to upload the design. How does that work? Do I upload after I pay?

I placed an order last week, too. So looking forward to the coffee. I really love how bitcoin opens up a whole new world of international trade.

Awesome, Evan. Thanks for supporting Bitcoin. I'll be at the restaurant in the next few weeks

It's not an ACH withdrawal. Just a bitcoin withdrawal. That should be instant. 18 hours and it hasn't even hit the network.

What's your turnaround time?

I just bought about 2 pounds of beautiful wild salmon and cod this afternoon from Jarret Stevens at Bristol Bay during the Hillcrest Farmer's market in San Diego. Nice smooth transaction and Jarret is a huge fan of bitcoin. Please send him some support if you happen to be in the area. He works both the Hillcrest and Vista farmers markets.

Join us for a great night of mixing and mingling with other folks in the Bitcoin space here in San Diego.
This month, I'll be doing a quick presentation on how to use the Armory wallet and its off-line capabilities to secure your bitcoin. Armory provides some awesome off-line, cold storage capabilities which allow you to have a secure off-line wallet that you can still make payments from without exposing your private keys to the network.
Those new to bitcoin are welcome to come and learn what this amazing technology/economy is all about. Anyone looking to trade is welcome to come and do a mini Satoshi Square. :) And as usual, everyone else is welcome to come by and banter about cryptocurrencies and the future of money.

I'm in SF a lot (live in San Diego) and have been using Lyft, but would love to support you instead. How can I contact you if needed
