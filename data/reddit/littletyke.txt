Just wanted to add, that I'm also working on getting them to make their book available for bitcoin when it comes out. So, I'm hoping that if they see any response from their tip jar, that will prove that there are professional people who use bitcoins out there. So, it makes sense for them to go to the trouble of making the book available for bitcoin.

I like this, I'm going to 'corporatize' it a bit and use it as a Why Bitcoin blurb.

This big investor group also happens to be registered at a mail drop service and calling that their office location...  ( See:  )

I've audited US banks and their software and infrastructure sucks on a massive scale. Regulations have nothing to do with it.

The list of stuff that GAW has bought and broke is getting longer and longer. I would say that he's trying to scam, but occam's razor says that he's just terrible with technology.  This is a guy that didn't even pay the bill for his company's internet point of presence for his customers' access. The more I look into his history (through even his own writings)... he comes off as a money hungry psychopath with NO technology skills... the guy didn't even know what bitcoin was in the middle of 2013... then got ripped off in late 2013, so learned his lesson by deciding to set up his own scam and it's just snow balled from there.

From the emails... I think he pawned that one off on Joe Mordica who was trying to GAW to pay the internet broadband bill before they got shut off in late Feb... so, your link is from 2012... so, darn.. I'm thinking that those people somehow don't have Comcast as an option.

Do we know it was used for paybase? Can you provide a link to someone that reviewed it? It would help me a lot if you could. thanks.

Well, a key point was that the debit card promise (you can pay anywhere at any shop with a debit card) and BillPay were supposed to be moving over the mineral.com ... BUT, if they don't have access to USD on the exchange, how's he going to make that work? I'm thinking that Walmart in Kansas isn't going to be real keen on getting paid in HK dollars, not to mention the local electric companies in the US.

It's going to suck if it really is located in Hong Kong and Hong Kong goes through with their idea to ban all crypto currencies because of that other scam... Right now 1 HK dollar = $0.13USD.... would be just too funny if he talks them into setting up shop there to avoid US authorities only to have the HK authorities to come in and confiscate it as a crypto-currency trading platform. And all the 'investors' get back out of it are HK dollars. 
Garza has all but said that the reason for HK is because he wants to evade US regulations. Not sure how he could paint a bigger target on his backside.

Banks don't usually cross any borders with cash in hand. They have an internal network to send transactions across. That network is from the 70s and it sucks.
The delays you see on money posting to your accounts has nothing to do with regulations. You notice they debit a check w/in hours of you writing it... but when it comes to a credit, it takes 10 business days that end up extended out to nearly 20 calendar days... that's because that money is held in float and used for their cash reserve account for those 20 days. So, yes.. they're required to have cash reserves that cover a percentage of your account balance so they have the money to hand to you when you want it... but it is the banks that decided to make up that cash reserve by floating all transactions for as long as possible instead of actually assigning cash to those accounts. AND, if you're unhappy about banks being required to have cash reserves... .then you're saying that when you want to take $400 out of an ATM, you'd be happy with them flashing you a note that says "sorry, no actual bills on hand, can you try back tuesday?"
I agree, they definitely could improve if they wanted to... but they don't because they value profits over service. AND some of the 'bad service' you get is by design because the do a constant shuffling of the books for the sole purpose of maximizing profits. So, I imagine they're attracted to the simplicity of the blockchain idea and the definite savings that they would experience... but their biggest question is how do we make it less transparent so we can keep shuffling the books like we're doing right now.

WOW... thanks, that's exactly what I needed.

no, their current systems suck big time. it would make sense for them to replace it with a customized version of the blockchain that only 'approved' banks can ad a node to.

unfortunately you won't be the first person to have flushed thousands of dollars over paycoins and right now, you'd probably have better luck selling it over on HT for paycoins.
