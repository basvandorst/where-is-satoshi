I am ok with ROI and what stands for RIP regarding fiat?

Is it true that people in Japan take pride of BTC as it was Satoshi Yakamoto who invented it???
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:54:32
See Max Keiser reports there on RT. This guy rocks

Was it an orange Lambo?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:27:03
Wow! Such currency.. To the Moon!!!

It is not exactly a BTC mining farm. Because they were all mined back in the 3rd millenium. It's transactions place... Planet. How many transactions does it confirm each single hour? Minute? Second?

Is it because the search algorithm was designed for blockchain by blockheads?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:03:42
right. people tend to forget about bad thing faster. Is that what you mean?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:20:12
Don't  worry even if you would see that all, Putin will fuck it all up as usually 
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:48:52
Right. Because it is like a chain made of coins. ��

in 2025 kids 8 years old will look like middle aged asian women.

That name has had a different history for sure. The earliest adopters. How about naming them all here and creating a separate subreddit?

Who's gonna bring you any evidence till you believe? Come on he's 65 years of age and he looks like that pony ass on that picture. Either way you prefer. Cheers!

And boom goes  BTC from 100K down to 88K a piece. 
Guessing the news in a year...
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:31:11
That's not an issue of bursting or not. That's a set of coŕrections possible. But take BTC and other cryptos as a reality. I know guys who hated it at below 10USD and never takled again after around 700. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:09:40
Because they think it's  BADcoin not  BITcoin. When actially it is a BATMANCoin standing for BTC.

Попиздить и проебаться. Зачем еще?
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:23:42
On a scale from 1 to 10, how shitty is this? Next they'll shut up about BTC for a while. Eat it ☺
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:03:28
Let us all hope he truly enjoyed those 10K BTC pizzas back there in 2010?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:32:54
We'd better ask Peter Schiff himself to get the straight answer. I guess it's the only option :-) 
Come on, look at the nicest guy - he came to there to market good ol' gold coins... Just to compare let's mark the day today and 'invest' into  &amp;  today - and look at this in 3 month / years? 
I know bunch of guys bought silver when  was about $2 per piece. I never ask them about  
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:27:28
Bye. I'm off to fuck much &amp; deep....
BTFD!!

The weakest post ever. Who cares about this prince and   his princedom. He most likely takes his financial advice from a fairy or a unicorn? 
So when a fairy will get connected to his office via  USB or Bluetooth and Saudi arabia will accept BTC it will be already on  the Moon. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:17:02
CryptoRuble? I guess it is because Vitalik Buterin met with Vlad P and CryptoRuble is going to be Ethereum based, not BitCoin based?

I upvoted for your downvote...

 i love them arguing
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:17:57
I guess when 100% people in Japan will associate with BTC it'd go to Mars.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:40:35
tulips you say?

precious metals are the greater bubble. We had been taught they were precious and not going to pay for them being gleaming. leave them to my mom ��

Antonopoulos is a tough Crypto Champion for sure. Good idea actually.

Seriously, I switched from goooogle 2  - the ads free results are amazing. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:38:13
This is cool to see it works in vo.mon places too. And rebuy and stuff not to get worried as some  blockheads.
How I wonder from your check it shows $ and  BTC. How much was this coffee in satoshies ??
