Absolutely, it's midnight here where I live and I reckon there should be at least some news in the morning already, can't wait!
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:54:22
Yeah, I am 99% sure that not updating my Windows regularly was what made this attack possible. I am not part of any LAN, I do not have Wi-Fi on the affected machine either. Still trying to figure out how I got it too!
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:02:00
That is some solid advice! Thank you for that, I will most definitely check out BackBlaze, seems reasonably priced indeed + screw Java! I'm already keeping an eye on bleeping computer's Twitter account, also the Malware Hunter Team which seems to be posting updates on this recent attack more frequently. I will bookmark this page though, can't have too many bookmarks, right? Also, you're most kind, thank you for taking the time and effort to write your replies, I wholeheartedly appreciate It!

Whelp, I'm not NHS but I got infected too. Closest I've ever come to 15 minutes of fame. To pay, or not to pay?
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:38:46
Hard to disagree with that. I am ready to go on a crusade as soon as I recover my data.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:58:38
Will most likely do that as well just to be on a "safe side" (sounds funny given the situation). I'm not 100% sure the files will get deleted though, as far as I understood the attackers will just not release a decryption key if payment isn't made in a week. Will look into this further.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:44:05
Agreed, lesson learned the hard way.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:51:21
Nope, no ID of any kind, just the wallet address. When I click the "check payment" button it connects to the server, then says that I did not pay. There are multiple transactions registered for that wallet with varying number of confirmations. Doesn't look good :(
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:24:44
Not even one verified report. Spent a LOT of time trying to find a single "success story", no luck.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:44:28
Solid advice, thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:31:29
No, it's because there has not been a single verified report of anyone who paid ransom recovering their files.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:29:03
Stupid (?) question from an affected user, how would the attackers be able to verify if a payment has been made if they assign the same BTC wallet address to multiple users? When I click "Check Payment" it says they have not received it, even though there are a number of transactions registered in the blockchain for this address..
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:17:14
And that's an optimistic scenario. The realistic one that I'm leaning towards is that they won't at all (unless they're captured and forced to).
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:04:59
You will get BCC right when the fork occurs on August 1st at 12:20 UTC, I am not sure how long it will take for the network to stabilize. Waiting a few days is no issue, they will stay yours and untouched until you decide to move them (your BTC public &amp; private key will be duplicated on the forked chain), please read up on replay attack possibility since that's apparently an issue, check out [this thread]( for example!
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:37:19
Yup, that's the thing, over 100 BTC extorted and not a single report that would at least give a ray of hope, seems shady as hell! Just as you said, seeing that this has blown out on an international scale and affected multiple governments, public institutions and companies, it's reasonable to assume that some top specialists had their weekend plans ruined and are actively pursuing a solution to this mess. Tough lesson for me, I've been delaying implementing a full backup solution for several months now because I couldn't decide on an external HDD. I will probably order one tomorrow and hope that I'll get my stuff back and have something to backup when someone manages to crack this thing. Appreciate your reply mate!
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:57:36
I haven't yet because I am fairly sure that won't help at all, this is the one though: 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:49:49
Cheers man, appreciate your kind words. Shady as hell, last I've heard (over 12 hours ago) they extorted over 100 BTC and not a single testimony from anyone that would recover their data ;(
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:23:45
I've spent nearly 40 hours trying to find one since the outbreak. I've had a few leads, but not one reliable report.

@_date: 2017-05-12 20:16:13
Yeah, I'm genuinely considering paying the ransom, just not sure whether I have an actual shot at recovering my data. I've been trying to look up information about people who paid and what happened next, no luck though.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:45:23
Only my flash drive which I have used with 2 of my computers exclusively (out of which only one was affected) , this couldn't have been the source.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:13:12
Thanks man, appreciate the kind words. I'm actually royally screwed, had backups of most important docs on a flash drive which I've been using at the time of attack so I lost the copies too. I just hope there will be some kind of a solution for recovering files at some point, lost most private things that aren't replaceable like photos, videos etc. :(
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:49:36
I'm really sorry to hear that man, let's hope that someone finds a way to recover the files soon!
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:47:47
Windows 7 64bit ESET, Malwarebytes, SpyBot, CCleaner and Ublock. No clue (haven't visited any suspicious websites, no shady e-mails, haven't opened any attachments, installed any new software recently etc). I'm maybe 2 months behind on patches so I've been vulnerable, but still no idea where and how I caught that shit.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:41:07
Everyone has 72 hours to pay an equivalent of $300, it becomes $600 after that, and then after a week they say you lose the possibility to recover your files forever. It would make sense indeed, I just don't think they can track a transaction to the sender. They have so far extorted over 100 BTC and I've been unable to find a single report that someone got their files decrypted which raises doubts as well..
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:20:49
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:40:43
That's what's worrying me. They got about 100 BTC so far, I've spent quite some time trying to find a single conformation that someone got their files decrypted without luck. The outlook isn't very optimistic :/ I still have nearly 3 days until the price is doubled, I guess I'll wait and see.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:19:01
Question  from an affected user, have any of you come across a report of someone paying the ransom and recovering their files? I've been searching for hours, no luck..
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:49:35
Amen, I've lost photos and vids from the last 10 years approximately, my whole music collection which took me even longer to accumulate, but this seems really irrelevant compared to LOTS of people not being able to receive proper healthcare because of this attack. Some guy in UK had to have his heart surgery delayed, ffs. For this they should get life sentences.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:42:35
People here seem to be keen on Mycelium. I would personally not store a big amount on any software wallet - I think a paper wallet generated on a secure machine should do the trick, there are plenty of guides in here on how to go about setting one up!
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:11:13
That's 100% right. However, as much as I despise BCC, you'll be missing out on potential gains (you'd be able to sell the shitcoin for BTC shortly after August 1st).
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:26:12
This is different. It's true that with a number of previous ransomware attacks (not WannaCry) the attackers would actually decrypt the files. There are no reports of WannaCry victims getting their files decrypted.
