Will do, thanks my friend. Let's just hope I eventually reach that $1000 value. I've been reading up on crypto for weeks and hesitant to pull the trigger. I finally decided to go for it yesterday with a small initial investment. Do you think its best to put it all in bitcoin right now? Or a little into ETH and litecoin as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:01:07
TAKE DOWN THAT WALL!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:13:18
I know it's free to move between coinbase and GDAX, but won't there still be a solid fee for moving from GDAX to wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:05
Yeah I was expecting a significant jump as well, oh well. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:13
any ideas? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:49:01
I'm holding you to that order. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:22:23
I would tell them that's what you're getting them, and help set them up with their account, but let them make the first purchase at the price they think is right. That initial buy is a lot of the initial fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:28
Got it, thanks. I’m just a little nervous/paranoid since this is the first time I’m actually using all of this stuff after reading about it for weeks. I appreciate your help though answering my questions that I’m sure have been asked a million times! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:46
I know some of those words
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:10
Here is a youtube video that appears to be from the developer. Maybe you can find a way to get in touch with him from there? Sorry I can't be more help at the moment but I'll keep looking. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:20:53
Transfer from coinbase to GDAX (free), then from GDAX to your wallet (GDAX covers the fees). You can get your BTC to your wallet for free this way if you intend on hodling. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:09
If you actually had an application error then please provide more info so the devs can recreate it and prevent it from happening in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:06
Where can I learn more about and buy this magical ripple you speak of
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:38
That’s an unfortunate but really good point. Thanks man. What would you say is roughly the threshold amount where it’s worth moving off coinbase/gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:49:32
Someone was trying to sell 1000+ BTC at exactly 17250 which stops people from selling above the 17250 price point so the price stayed uncharacteristically stagnant for a few hours while people slowly bought up the large volume this person was trying to sell.  On the bottom chart of gdax, it appears as a vertical red “wall”.  Once all of the BTC were sold, the price was free to rise again.  Hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:52
Makes sense. Bitcoin has so much current support and momentum behind it, I agree with you that it would be easiest/best to fix the problems here, then try to transfer all of that support somewhere else. Cheers to that and hopefully I can in some way help make it happen! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:15:08
Completely get what you're saying here and I agree with you. The amount of stress that comes with seeing my student loans accrue interest is out of this world. If I could start making serious dents in that with the small amount of money I put into BTC, I'd jump at the opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:19:24
___ BTC * 19,000.00 = Your BTC value in USD
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:38:33
Amazing, just did it and it’s showing up in my electrum wallet but says “unconfirmed”. Any idea how long that confirmation takes? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:30
I agree with you, and I upvoted his initial post because of it. It is a problem, and one without a current solution. I gave him a way to get invested at a small value, and avoid fees, something I finally did just last week. I never claimed to have the solution to the congestion/fees issue. I was just giving him a workaround for his specific problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:59:25
Gah yeah I shoulda spread some of my money into ETH yesterday but I only had done the research on the BTC wallet I have (electrum). I haven't heard of ripple but will research that as well. Thanks for all your help and I hope you continue to have success!  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:36
Wow, nice. Fuck right off Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:10:32
Also fees are higher with a card. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:55:34
Looks like I can only buy ripple with BTC on that site, is that correct? I can't just pay in USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:06:45
click on depth chart
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:08
Electrum is the exact wallet I use. I moved my .01 BTC off coinbase/GDAX and to electrum because I'm in it for the long haul. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:15:21
Lol I dream of the day I have $1000s in crypto. But yeah it actually sounds reasonable to hold it on the exchange for about that long given the fee rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:16:54
Thanks again for all the info! Very helpful stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:12:54
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:22:58
So what you're saying is I invested at a terrible time (17,800). What coins do you think could capitalize on bitcoin's missteps? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:54:26
That might cause a small blip, but it's not that the price will be completely fixed right on 17250, drop right to 17200, then pop right back up to 17250. A huge sell like 1000+ BTC at a single price just keeps the overall price hovering in that range, which given the recent price history, is uncharacteristic. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:48
No worries man. I'm a relative noobie who's been lurking for a couple weeks and finally invested 200 USD last week. I wish I had all the answers you're looking for because I've noticed a lot of frustration and doubt increasing over even just the last week. But I'm still delving into all the different variables at hand (segwit, lightning, etc.) while also trying to find some worthwhile altcoins to back. But that lightning network demo currently on the front page seems to show some promise. Maybe that's the beginning of the solution we're looking for...?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:33:19
Oooo snaps, ok I guess that's the way to go then. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:53:43
I have roughly ~200 USD of BTC on coinbase. It's pretty much impossible for my transfer that to my personal wallet without paying ~20% in fees I guess? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:48:59
Transfer to GDAX (free) then to your electrum wallet (GDAX covers that fee). So you effectively get your BTC to your own wallet for free. You’ll just have to pay to send them elsewhere...or, you know, hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:05:43
And this appears to be only rising, no? As someone who bought with the sole intention to hodl, I’m wondering if I should just bite the bullet now before it gets worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:03:31
Man that's awesome. If you don't mind me asking, how much USD was the mining rig? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:31:33
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:04
already down to 360
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:35:19
That’s my exact problem. I bought about 150 worth of BTC. It’s worth ~200 now. But it’s going to cost me 10+% to just move it to my electrum wallet. I’m not sure it’s worth it and don’t know what to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:01:57
It depends on how much you have and what you want to do with it. If you're definitely holding no matter what, then transfer from Coinbase to GDAX then to a wallet so you're safe if any site gets hacked. But just be aware that you'll have to pay the fees when you eventually wanna transfer the money back out of your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:15
Yeah I backed Bitcoin with all I could (only ~200 USD unfortunately) for similar reasons, and I'm not considering taking my money elsewhere. I'm just mainly looking towards the next year when I may have more money to put behind other coins, and wondering if you saw a coin implementing the ideas you like more efficiently. But I've tagged you on here and will definitely look forward to learning more from your posts about Bitcoin in the future! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:39:35
What are your thoughts on electrum? I'm investing less than ~300 dollars to start so I find it hard to justify paying for an $80 physical wallet unless it increases in value rather substantially. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:13:12
How do their fees compare to coinbase/GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:14
Just read the post you linked, and it was interesting. I guess the best thing we can do with LN at the moment is hope it's adopted at the goldilocks pace needed to reduce blockchain pressure gradually, and not overload it immediately. 
But back to the segwit issue, what are the primary reasons that you think the big players aren't applying segwit? I assume they, and the miners, are loving the current fees they're getting and don't have a motivation to change anything? What about a hypothetical situation where everyone just held, and wouldn't buy/send BTC until the adoption happened? Would this provide the impetus needed to make them apply segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:33:49
And I’m over here stressing about my 100 USD I put in yesterday lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:14:05
It's really amazing how much I see him after tagging him in RES.
