I think this is the key point, if a coin mirrors equity that is publicly traded on crypto exchanges. Does it have voting rights / claim to companies assets, not a private stake sale / fund raise but publicly traded, expected to receive dividends etc. Then investors need to be protected and companies need to report:
"The laws and rules that govern the securities industry in the United States derive from a simple and straightforward concept: all investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to buying it."
The SEC uses the "Howey Test" to determine if an asset is defined as a security. If you are interested in the details, you should have a look at the report.

THe SEC will define if new coins are securities by the nature of the capital raise (private placement no, ICO and subsequent secondary trading, yes, for example). If they are, they need to be registered and regulated like any other security (equity, derivatives etc) to protect consumers.
