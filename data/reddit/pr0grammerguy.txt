There were at least 9 shows who peaked at around 100k.  That's a fact.  In 2014 we've already broke 100k a time or two as well.  You're either a liar or you're deliberately spreading ignorance.

It may *feel* like SC2 has been going down, but it's actually going up.  Esports getting bigger helps *everyone* in Esports.  The reason some games died out of Esports is not because others got bigger but rather because the publishers broke the competitive market for their games (e.g. COD).

I said ~100k didn't I?

The only person I see in this subthread lying is you.
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:32:23
That's one event.  2 out of the 3 showings were *over* 100k, the other was 99k....  Sorry, I'm not going to spend any more of my preciousness time educating your ignorance (assuming you're even arguing in good faith and not blatantly lying assuming no one will call you on it).

This is a fantastic idea.  Personally, I think your best bet here is Starcraft 2.  It's true that LoL and Dota2 have larger numbers of viewers but that means you'll be competing with a lot more advertisers as well.  You would be able to get huge names in Starcraft 2 while with LoL/Dota2, I doubt you could get the big names without investing heavily.

Citations that SC2 is dying?  Tournament viewership is consistently up.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:34:14
Demonstrably not true.  Last year there were about 9 tournaments that had ~100k.  In SC2's "hay day" it got that maybe twice.
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:30:35
Source for this supposed decline?  Viewership has *increased* by quite a bit.  It's gone down *relative to LoL/Dota* but that's a very different thing.

It's not easy talking to someone so slow.  These tournaments peaked at ~100k and over.  Back in the SC2 hay day **it only managed that twice, not ~9 times like these days**.

So what?  There are more people streaming now.


What does even this mean?  SC2 viewership is up.  Yes this year.  Compared to other esports?  Who cares?

Dude, wtf are you talking about?  My statement can only be misleading if you're mentally handicapped (which it appears you might actually be).  I said 9 of them, not 90% of them.  The phrase "9 of them" implies there were more than 9 and those 9 were the only ones that were around the 100k mark (otherwise I would have said something like "90% of them" or "most of them", etc.).  No person with a normally functioning brain could take that to mean "virtually every single SC2 show was around 100k viewership".  **You** worry for **my** life?

Why do you feel threatened by SC2's niche success?  SC2 doing better doesn't mean your game has to do worse.  There are enough fans to go around.
