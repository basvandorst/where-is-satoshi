Yes,we tried it(oil), and not bad.The temperature of board is stable.However, we are not sure whether immersion cooling will work, when mass production is coming.So,do u have any suggestion for us?

Actually,R-BOX is focoused on experiencing,bu blades are coming in few days, which are more suitable for mining farms.

Take it easy,you can contact the technical support of BTC-e.I ever met the simmilar problem on cryptsy,which is another BTC transaction website, the technicist will help you step by step.Finally, if the 2FA is not work, they can reset or cancel it for you.So, don't worry too much,and God bless u.

I state that, our miners,which are equipped by AM's gen 3 chips,are not in stock.But will come soon,just like we said on our official website.
Please be patient to AM's gen 3 chips, all things are OK,they will make public announcement at the right time I guess.But I wont say anything about it. 
Thanks, we'll do good job,but we need time. We'll prove it by our miners!

We are testing immersion of Asicminer's cube miner, it's running well, so,both air cooled and immersion are ok, but which type will be choosed will condiser customer's demands and the cost of products.

Chap.2:The Satoshi Block
先不说它是不是货币，但首先他是一个非常牛逼的软件产品，我当时就立刻意识到，这个东西本身存在着极大的投资价值。当时也没有思考多么深入，做出这个判断的主要有以下几点：1、比特币总量有限； 2、有这么一群人愿意接受它，并且这个群体还在不断扩大。
另外一个消息俄罗斯将举行比特币峰会。这个消息倒是个好消息，毕竟之前老毛子已经对比特币下过禁令，看来战斗种族并没有被这个禁令吓倒。

Huobi just wanna show positive attitude , does it work? Risk from transaction platform hits people's faith of Bitcoin,only third-party supervision can restore trust.

Thanks for your attention, no one can be more suitble than Rockxie, who is one of the most famous partner to friedcat's Co., to be our escrow. We only sell products in stock now, we stick that honesty is the most basic and important element for transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:46:23
Why did u say that?
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:53:13
yeah, air cooling is the mainstream technique, and also our preferred one. immersion cooling is a radical test, but we dont definetely deny it,maybe use it for some special target. Asicminer PCB design will public sooner, maybe before next friday,I guess.
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:50:12
we dont accept preorders in first batch. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:26:57
Thanks for your words, we just do real transactions, and maintain our reputation carefully.We only sell products in stock now.
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:14:07
You know Rockxie very well, he wont offer an escrow,and he will do what he said.
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:09:31
means everyone can be miner,if u are willing to.

I can't agree with more,and we are doing the translation now,please wait for a while.
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:28:31
bitcoin price is too high to growing,if the transaction unit can fall down to mBTC, the real price of BTC can grow tens or houndreds times.
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:36:32
competition is becoming more and more stronger, especially in mining. We're ready to face it, thanks my friend.
P.S. I'm not rockxie, but his spokersperson of the rockxie miner project.

I'm so sorry for your horrible investment by google translate.We are working on translation now,English version will come very soon, thanks.

We've been working for days to our products,  but not finished yet, it'll come out later than ReddiquetteAdvisor guess, maybe  at the end of Apr.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:18:17
Why do u think that more powerful hash rates per miner means less competition?
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:05:28
Power consumption will less than 600W/T(considering loss,and theoretical value is only 300-400W/T), which is lower than other miners on market, but the price has not yet been determined, we'll update immediately,if it's figured out.Thanks.
