This is definitely a challenge and why we're connecting as many homes as possible with automation devices. Nest, belkins, etc.

Awesome! It's called "Demand Response." 
From a smart grid standpoint, it's the best technology to quickly alleviate capacity issues and has the added benefit of improving your environmental footprint. Other tech (like battery arrays) can meet acute supply demands, but are very expensive to implement.

Exactly - we send you a text notification on when to turn down and you can choose what you want to turn off.
We're building in some connected home features, so you can hook up your Nest, EV, or use Belkin WeMo (wifi power switches) to automatically turn off hot water heaters, spas, pool pumps, or a fridge (if you don't mind the chance that the light might be off for 10 minutes)

Just as a head's up...we haven't built in the Bitcoin feature just yet. However, it sounds like there's some interest here, so we'll put it on our roadmap.

Any deregulated energy market in the US. We're focused on California and will soon be on the eastern seaboard and Texas. 
It would be awesome to go international...but we're a startup and need to stay focused for now.

No catch. The only thing you might consider a "catch" is that you need to turn down when we tell you. 
If that's an inconvenience you'd prefer to live without, you can also connect to home automation devices to do it for you.

This is exactly what happens, but it's done at a level above the utilities. Utilities actually purchase power on energy markets, which is where we offer our "virtual power plant" resources. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:44:35
When we tell people to turn down their energy, utilities are actually paying ~10x what they're charging customers. The reason prices are so high at these times is because large and inefficient power plants are turned on to meet short-term demand. 
Utilities would prefer to pay companies like us to turn down the demand on the grid instead of paying an expensive power plant to turn on.

Cool. Here's a brief explanation about how this works:
Capacity (i.e., unused electricity) is now treated the same as generation (i.e., the electricity that your local power plant produces) on deregulated energy markets. 
This means that when an energy customer reduces their consumption (as compared to their projected consumption (this is calculated using your past 45 days of consumption behavior), that customer can now sell the reduction into energy markets. 
Regarding the "who wouldn't want free money" point...sorry, I should have worded the question more specifically. 
We've projected that the average user could generate up to $130 / year (.25 Bitcoin) or up to $250 / year (.5 Bitcoin) if you connect a Nest or Plug-in Hybrid / EV to our system. 
We haven't built in the BitCoin payout feature just yet, but if anyone is interested in signing up, you can check it out at 
Any and all ideas are welcome too.
