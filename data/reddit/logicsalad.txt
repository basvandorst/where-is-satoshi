Oh, the irony.

You call his tactics "thuggish" but are ok with this horseshit getting rammed through? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:18:45
Paul's the only anti-war candidate. Btw, bernie totally screwed audit the fed. He's a goon. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:14:28
You mean he'll never poll 20%? 
Polls are total bullshit, btw. Consider the group of people who still have landlines and don't screen their calls. That sample is utterly meaningless.
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:25:40
Nope, still China.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:55:40
Sure didn't take long for the au thugs to remind everyone why bitcoin is so important.
@_date: 2015-12-21 13:50:51
I KNEW IT!

He's actually a very nice guy.
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:41:31
It was actually pretty rude.
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:06:05
None of those things are paid for by income tax.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:16:32
False. Go read the wiki.

Right on. If doog was going to run, he would have done it when he had over 50k btc in the bankroll. Definitely not after purposely downsizing the operation.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:03:45
Much better so far.
@_date: 2015-08-08 04:04:43
He will die in Japanese prison and nary a tear will be shed.

By that absurd logic, so is bitcoin core. After all, it's been hard forked many times, including the change to add the 1meg block cap in the first place.
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:56:55
Almost guaranteed.
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:52:56
Gold bug's what?
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:40:09
Can we remove the stop gap 1Mb block size already? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:19:30
I have no idea what this nonsense is, but JD4Life.
@_date: 2015-04-22 04:41:32
What a ripple-off.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:12:01
I hope it's not too late by then. Lots of big money is looking at using bitcoin, seeing the crippled transaction limit, and moving on. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:47:13
Not everyone...and I think the most vocal were people who just hated the idea bitcoin would succeed.

For one thing, they are required to report cash purchases to the irs. Enjoy your visit.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:45:52
I used to, and I still do.
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:37:50
Roger has done more for Bitcoin than most other people combined. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:15:49
That was inconsequential compared to China's buys.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:06:01
Goodbye weak hands.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:42:26
And some of us simply don't want to hold dollars when we have a choice.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:45:23
You seem like you are considering bitcoin as a forex investment. The success of bitcoin depends on whether enough people will put their money in to see it through. Not the same situation. The acts of the participants will directly affect the outcome. There are many of us who are investing in the system, not in a "position." This is an ideological move as much as financial.
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:05:39
People don't "move" bitcoin to a geographic location. That's not how bitcoin works. But they might move themselves.
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:39:50
Been ignoring this horseshit since the price was $2. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:08:10
You say that like there is no risk holding foreign fiat in their reserves, despite the insane race to see who can inflate the fastest all the central banks are in.
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:32:47
Hells yes.
