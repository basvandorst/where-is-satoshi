I’m making an appeal to crucify him

You look like a huge disappointment. You pulled it off well.

Someone tell me how HODLing isn’t speculation and mass delusion.

You should invest in some spelling classes

I sold all my coin just to get you all to shut the fuck up

Bitcoin is having its death throes

This is a perfect thread

I’d be more concerned with paying to retake English courses, if I were you.

Pump and Dump, I expect. Make profit and destroy a competing system.

That was when they weren’t invested in bitcoin. Now they are, so they’ll publish pro-bitcoin pieces.

Broad-based index funds all the way

I followed what you were saying until you mentioned bitcoin illiquidity. How so? It seems extremely liquid.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:21:04
Thanks for the solid explanation.

You’re a moron

He doesn’t look Han enough
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:43:11
 I wish you all the best of luck. I’d just rather make money the slow and sure(er) way.

Thank you. More people need to realize this too, before it’s too late.

It’s slightly less than the number of times I’ve banged your mom.

I’ve got $394 left in bitcoin. I just want it to get past $400 so I can sell it and be done with it. It’s just a speculative circus now. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:31:47
Speculators are so stupid. You might as well be placing bets as to which direction a leaf will blow in the wind at any given time.

I lived in China for 3 years. It’s a country of liars and scammers. I would never do business with the Chinese.

This stinks of desperation
