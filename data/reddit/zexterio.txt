I think it's more like 35x or even 100x in some cases.

How would you declare exactly? Like your initial transaction with a FIAT exchange and the sum you used then?
They're not actually expecting people to declare in real-time all the cryptocurrencies they hold at a given time...right?

Fiat moon when?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:34:55
Today maybe. It wasn't on the high side before 2008. At least not in the US. European banks have been much more reasonable.

Are you suggesting Bitcoin should never get anonymity/privacy features?
We're at most a few years away from having all sorts of companies track most of the big blockchains and identify people by name in real-time. Our transactions should not be *public*. At the very least we need an "HTTPS" protocol for cryptocurrencies. Right now everything goes in plaintext.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:33:39
Which is kind of a BS reason.

Doesn't LN centralize things a bit, kind of like exchanges do?
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:46:07
Huh? What about more centralized coins like NEO that grew 1,000x in 2 years? I also think plenty of the top 20 cryptocurrencies don't use PoW, which technically makes them "less secure". But the demand seems to be quite high for them, too...

No, in fact companies have kept salaries the same in real power for decades.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:16:18
Their value can swing, just like that of gold, especially when central banks make it easy to buy homes on credit, which means a lot of people will buy homes they can't afford and also that the prices will go up as demand increases. After the dust settles, the prices will plummet.

Hmm, aren't most private cryptocurrency moving away from mixing coins? They're going for ring signatures, SNARKs, and STARKs soon. I think Bitcoin should have adopted privacy features 2 years ago, but if it's going to do it no, it's probably best to do ring signatures like Monero, and then maybe switch to STARKs if they can deliver on their promise (and are proven to be secure).

Which will still not wanted to be audited.

One of the reasons for that is there are more people with investing experience in BTC, and also more people invested in general, so the (huge) volatility is less now. The more people use a cryptocurrency, the more stable it becomes. That goes for everything from pump and dump coins (which tend have very small community before the PnD) to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:02:41
Then I would suggest at least reducing your risk *slightly* but increasing the potential reward significantly by investing in a few top altcoins as well as "new" altcoins, too.
So maybe put 30% in BTC, 30% in ETH, 20% in XLM, STRAT, DASH, LTC (5% in each), and another 20% in EOS, ANS, Factom, Lisk, Ark, PIVX, Ardor, BAT, STEEM, UBIQ, LBC, and maybe a few others (like 2% in each).
When BTC will increase by 2-3x, some of those will increase by 5-20x in the same period.
You should *not* expect to withdraw the money from your coins for *at least a year*, maybe two, especially if you want to "get rich" off of this strategy.

It's just digital tulip money. It's not like it's *real money*.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:42:36
It would be nice if BTC would get a client written in Rust. It would be great not just for BTC, but for all the other cryptocurrencies that fork the client.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:41:09
Does the Bitcoin community intend to keep PoW forever, even if say the Ethereum network or other networks become 100x more efficient?
If not, then there's no point in building ASICs.
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:18:13
That's just not true. A few years ago you "couldn't even buy a pizza" with Bitcoin. Until you could.
