Probably not much at this stage. How will you buy bitcoin when you don't have access to your funds? 
I am from Europe, but worked as an independent bitcoin trader in Beirut a few years back. The market is very small, and transfers to exchanges is/was banned by BDL. I only traded back and forth in cash which is quite limiting if demand is only on one side.

I predict that in the future, the nation states will compete for mining power just to gain influence. So it doesn't have to be economically viable, because it will be subsidised by the taxpayer.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:17:37
When/if Bitcoin gets big enough, other actors who will mine at a loss only to obtain influence will enter the market. States and big companies etc. This will be the end China's dominance.

"The timeline of this proposal is recklessly short to such an extreme
level that we have never, to the best of my knowledge, seen a prior
proposal so hasty.  Nowhere does this specification provide
justification or assurance that this is at all safe.  The time line of
it violates the most minimal of responsible engineering practices, by
being shorter than even a fast development and release candidate
timeframe.   This proposal carries an extreme risk for parties to lose
money due to transaction reversals at two distinct points in time and
provides no proposed countermeasures to avoid these losses." Greg Maxwell (

The status quo will not be the status quo if a hard fork happens. Is that so hard to see? The current status quo is maintained by all participating agents, and if that dynamic changes you no longer have the status quo of today.
