Apparently (it seems at least plausible) this was done since 80% of stolen bank funds were transfered away to BTC exchanges.

FYI, there's a continuum of PC-savviness. It's not like there are only "hurr durr my internet doesn't work halp plox" and "hardcore commandline geek masterrace" people. Running a full node is not that different from hosting e.g. a game server.

Outgoing connections have a limit of 8, and incoming (ie. to your open port) default to a maximum of 125.

You got to be kidding. Running a full node isn't something very sophisticated. Redirect ports, keep it running at &gt;8 connections, update when necessary. That's it.

Well, Japanese is one of these language in which every random sequence of characters means something. [No kidding. I just made this up using charmap.](

I think that being able to put arbitrary data to the blockchain can be as dangerous as it is useful currently. Imagine that someone put information deemed to be a state secret (like encryption keys). Or just offending one very friendly religion ;) Given the power that theocracies have over their citizens, they can easily ban Bitcoin and actually have it filtered just like they did with other major seemingly can't-do-without sites.

    - How many bitcoin users does it take to change a lightbulb?
    - It's not the protocol's fault.

If Steam refuses, how about asking GOG?

I'm tired of this China bullshit and following crashes every now and then. To be honest, I'd be happy if they had outright banned Bitcoin exchanges back in the December. Give people in the civilized world who own BTC and other cryptocurrencies the peace of mind they deserve. &lt;/rant&gt;

At this point you might just as well ask, why not WiFi and VoIP?

So would I be safe by setting a trusted node in Schildbach's wallet?

More like Blyatcoin.

This actually is very interesting question. How a 9-to-5 person ever manages to get anything done if others work at the same hours?

Nothing to be ashamed of :P Probably the worst Polish mobile operator :v

Well, if any evidence of a vulnerability or a hack surfaces, the value is going to plummet.

Well, in Poland, [Biedronka]( also doesn't, though they do have ATMs (mainly Euronet, some eCard) at almost every outlet. Recently, they've even introduced mobile payments via [IKO]( and [PeoPay]( but still no credit/debit card payments.

I think that the current no-fees period invites HFTers to spam even more transactions than usual.

As a Pole, you got to be kidding me. The current gov't has a track record of pushing their legislation despite social opposition. Example: People opposed that 6-year old children go to school (for a number of good reasons) and the ministry of education insisted on it anyway. This was obviously done due to imminent teacher lay-offs because of demographical recession. They also grow administration despite promising otherwise. It doesn't take a genius to notice this is done in order to get loyal electorate in the public sector. Then you have all this subsidies that are granted for young people to get their own flat, but this applies only to new ones. So clearly housing developers were at it. 
tl;dr: Vox populi my ass. Polish government is a bunch of lobbied and cronyist liars. (Exceptions may apply, but party discipline overwhelms them).
As far as solidarity goes, only in the face of common danger. Other than that, social trust is low. Stereotypically: "My neighbor bought a new expensive car. Surely he stole the money somehow (corruption, fraud, etc)."

I think it's quite pointless to use QR codes for such a short and memorable domain (Not that normal people would scan them anyway :P) Also, you wasted a possibility of tracking how many people actually scanned these stickers (using a suitable URL shortener or your own script). The dot-based design in conjunction with very large logo (you actually went with it over the "timing" area) make it quite hard to scan, even when  the image was rectified back to a square in GIMP.
Another cool idea would be to give away small amount of BTC to first X people who have scanned them.

As an OpenStreetMap editor: Please check your edits before adding anything to the map. Also, the name field is not intended for a (promotional or not) description. There are many places only with name and payment:bitcoin=yes, without specifying what it really is (eg. an office, shop or a restaurant). Go to the [Wiki]( if you want to know how to map properly, eg. providing details such as opening hours.
edit: If you ever happen to catch the bug and get yourself involved in OSM, iD editor is too shitty to be used on regular basis. Download JOSM and you will thank me.
