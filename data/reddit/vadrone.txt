[Is that what's going on right now?](
The transactions are literally making my browser lag

That's the joke
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:00:26
That's not what he means. He's asking how the different markets decide what price to charge per BTC, not how preev gets their numbers.

0.018 BTC :(

I think he means that the fun part of a rollercoaster is the fall, and the fun part of owning Bitcoin is watching the price rise (among other things). So it could be judged both ways.

A human being denier, as well

I'm 18 with 0.018 BTC. It's not all bad
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:37:12
Yeah ofc I do
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:45:44
And another thing to remember: 1 mBTC ≥ 1 USD. Let's hope it stays that way for a while, since it makes things so much simpler.

Yep, came out yesterday

Yeah. Nowadays it requires entire rooms dedicated to rigs with special hardware specifically designed for Bitcoin mining, just to have a chance of receiving the prize of 12.5 BTC (the reward decreases by 50% every 4 years).

See that long, vertical string of "50 BTC" to the right of the image?
1 BTC is currently worth 891 US dollars.

Oh look, it's this post again.

Nigeria and Ghana are the two countries who are googling the most about Bitcoin right now, at least.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:25:58
Thanks for confirming your stupidity so we didn't have to do it for you.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:10:26
"Just" is relative. It can mean lots of things.
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:00:06
Hi, thank you very much for doing this!
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:33:36
Feels like that great, hollow feeling you get after taking a massive shit
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:50:11
Completely doable, considering we just passed both $800 *and* $900 in three days. It'll likely crash back down eventually, though, since what we're seeing here is a bubble in development.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:35:18
Where's @_date: 2016-11-30 09:17:22
TIL you buy coffee with Starbucks

LMAO, best Twitter response I've ever read
