Dcabtc.com is a great tool to test how much you want to put in
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:15:36
Better off with cash app or coinbase
@_date: 2019-11-27 06:52:58
Yea... Get back to me when they start selling optical computers with photonic chips at Best Buy

Dollar-cost average at any time is the safest method if you are long term bullish
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:06:03
I’m planning on trying. Will update on how it goes

This product is new. They were in beta for a bit but must have been another service of theirs

How you know this many big words but don’t know what a run on sentence is

Should have leveraged 4x

I feel like “spend your crypto” products are only being released to prove ppl wrong who say you can’t buy anything with it... Who wants to go through the trouble &amp; fees of buying crypto just to spend it?

Good post

Keeping BTC in a bank completely depletes the purpose of BTC
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:00:29
Press release didn’t mention a payment processor.
@_date: 2019-10-28 22:04:05
Does pro banking pro government necessarily mean anti bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:17:58
What’s your concern here
@_date: 2019-10-08 03:47:31
My easy recommendation would be to buy on Cashapp if you’re poor or Coinbase if you’re rich. Other option is Gemini but haven’t tried it.
Then send it to exodus wallet. It’s super easy to use, has a clean UI and can link to a ledger hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:16:26
Mind explaining what you mean?
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:08:20
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:08:56
Oh. It's worked pretty nicely for me. Sorry sir.
@_date: 2019-12-07 06:38:54
Explain your cash app reasoning.
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:46:45
I feel you. On the other hand it sort of presents Bitcoin to the people who are looking to invest in stocks.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:39:18
Download cash app. Send it to the deposit address on there. Sell it for USD on there. Spend on cash app or transfer to your bank account.

As I said, corporations come together to form a blockchain network. I don't think they have some big criminal scheme to collude and f\*\*\* over everyone they work with. Especially with their reputations. But think as you may. 
&amp; nobody said anything about using the same PoW algo as Bitcoin. Corporations don't mine in general.

Gotcha. I put “conservative” in quotes because that’s how I heard Vitalik describe it lol. &amp; I’ll definitely start trying to keep up with the governance discussions. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-11 06:42:15
I slept on this aspect because I learned about blockchain governance through Ethereum and I guess it’s way easier for them to get their miners/nodes on the same page because of the size of the operation.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:07:08
You must be new

I once stole my brothers wife
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:41:13
Yep. You might have to give them a bunch of your info but it’s one of the easiest ways in the U.S.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:09:58
Unchained is cool because the host doesn’t hold crypto, therefor is less biased. She’s super into it though. Great interviews
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:50:23
It's not physically settled, so you don't have rights to your crypto. Cash App has cheaper fees than Coinbase but only has BTC. I'm pretty sure Gemini is only like 1% but also has limited coins. 
Most cost effective way is probably to buy BTC off of Cash App, send it to an Exodus wallet and then swap for another coin through there.

1. They’re in legal contracts with other nodes, so they have to trust them, but still benefit from improved security over other models of data keeping. Simply because no entity in the network is powerful enough to go back and change consensus. 
2. ??? Proof of Work only works with bitcoin? Are you okay???
