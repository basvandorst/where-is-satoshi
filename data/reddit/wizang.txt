Which is interesting because shelters where I live (pdx) actually import dogs from other regions because people snap them all up. Which is a great problem to have for sure. I've had friends who got shelter dogs where they have been misrepresented in things like age and temperament so it definitely goes both ways. Of course a well bred puppy doesn't gaurantee you in a perfect dog either. Lots of work either way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:57:37
I agree about puppy mills and did a lot of research before getting our guy. I hope everyone does their research and at least considers a shelter dog but feeling obligated to get a rescue is just wrong. I can go on about the pros and cons we considered but ultimately I feel it's a personal decision and the love you have for your doggo is the most important thing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:52:37
This rescue only shaming has gotten way out of hand. Everyone should at least consider a rescue but getting a dog a different way doesn't make you Satan. Fuck off your high horse.

At least they ran the country who's currency displays their image.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:39:25
Honestly sort of bullshit to use someone's image on something they have literally nothing to do with or opinion about considering they're dead.

What kind of bandwidth does running a node go through (assuming you already have the blockhain downloaded)? I remember my miners using a shocking amount back in 2011.

Well I'm pretty sure this game is written in javascript sooo...

You writing it in javascript? If so, how do you plan to wrap the game up for a desktop app? A friend and I have thought about this for a steam game but wasn't sure how plausible it was.

Not upgrading your OS then complaining when it's not supported anymore is pretty silly.

Let's compare wages in 1919 vs now as well.
@_date: 2015-08-02 19:28:10
Something I didn't see mentioned is that while you have the bandwidth for a full node, make sure it wont kill any usage limits you have on your service. Full node uses a surprisingly large amount of bandwidth when you total it over time.

Oh no no no.

It's possible the price could go up, really anything could happen.

You really can't know that.

Best single card yes. Best perf/$, depends on your system, but probably not.

Why start your own pool when there are plenty of good ones to join? A 2 or 3 person pool is practically the same as going solo anyway. 
@_date: 2012-06-04 20:55:24
How does that work? I assume you are referring to your name.
@_date: 2011-06-30 19:21:36
CPUs are much easier to cool and in a way are simpler. The video cards have not only the GPU but the memory, voltage regulators, capacitors etc, all that can and will degrade over time. Video card death rate is much higher than CPUs in general, even under normal gaming use. I think it would be naive to think that just because you're keeping your mining machine relatively cool that you will never have hardware failures. Also, supercomputers go through parts regularly, its a big part of their upkeep cost.
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:30:08
I vote for this.
@_date: 2011-10-18 22:54:43
I would say it's gotten EVEN less appealing now with price dropping yet. It was the insane difficulty spike that drove a lot of miners out (myself included), except for the well established, the server farms and the idiots.
@_date: 2011-06-29 18:55:08
Wait, so was the trojan author really stupid enough to make their worker name/pass the same as their deepbit login? Is that how this person got into their account? Seriously what an idiot.
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:01:36
It now seems to be working at a decent pace. My BTC are there and all seems to be well... for now.

Memory has next to zero performance, in fact you can downclock the memory and get a few extra Mhash's out with less wattage. 5000 series is generally bettery than 6000 though 5850 and above are generally difficult to find right now. 5970s are going for around $1000 each on ebay. Here is a comparison [chart](

For the second card non xfired/sli'd (which you don't want) under windows you must do the dummy plug. Not under linux.

Mine was denied. I submitted Dwolla account number and primary IP address. I've resubmitted with estimated account balance... hope that's enough.
EDIT: Update, about 12hrs later I received an approved email. Yay!

So you're the one that bought them all.
@_date: 2011-06-02 11:24:03
Replace the thermal paste and increase ventilation if possible. Running that high for sustained periods will most likely decrease the life of your card. 
@_date: 2011-08-12 16:17:13
Seriously, don't bother.
@_date: 2011-06-29 00:17:12
Don't bother with that card.
@_date: 2011-06-06 21:30:41
It all has to do with architecture and is not directly related to gaming performance. Nvidia cards are just not designed well for this application.  6000 also did not really offer performance boosts over 5000. They seem to be a bit worse at hashing.
@_date: 2011-06-25 01:26:29
If you really have access to RUNNING/Installing software of a top 300 super computer I think you should be able to answer all of these questions yourself in an hours reading tops. I also know that HPC centers usually doll out time on their machines because the power is in high demand. I doubt you'd be able to run stuff behind the scenes without someone noticing.

No there is a cycle, on/off, for different stages in the plants life. This is what the power companies look for most.

I had an admittedly shit password for my Mt. Gox, but a good one for my email. Gmail locked down my account about an hour ago due to "suspicious activity" and had me reset my password. Just a reminder to everyone to change their passwords...

I think everyone in r/bitcoins have heard of bitcoins... but anyway, there is a lot of discussion on getting websites to use bitcoins. Most places never will, since their value is volatile and their usage as currency is in dispute right now. Though, doesn't hurt to try I suppose?
@_date: 2011-10-17 19:00:03
Bitcoin price was initially driven by speculation. Once mining became less appealing, price fell. The price is now returning to a more realistic value considering the people who are still buying are smaller, and not generally doing it for investment. The true test of bitcoin will be its continued use outside of trading on Mt. Gox, not its value compared to the dollar.

Mining solo on 400Mhash/sec would not be statistically wise as difficulty would change faster than you could reasonably expect to solve a block and you would get no reward at each difficulty level. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:08:52

In terms of cost effectiveness 5830s are quite a bit better. If you're interested in getting the highest raw power out of a single mobo, then yes 5870s/5970s are best.
@_date: 2011-06-12 00:38:14
Because nvidia cards are shit for mining.

Those temps are pretty reasonable at least for the higher end cards, though the 6770 may just run cooler due to the fact its on the lower end. Running a video card at full load for any extended amount of time is most likely running the chance of shortening it's lifespan. However, the lower the temps the less that is an issue.
@_date: 2011-11-01 08:47:30
I think the real problem is eliminating greed. If tomorrow the entire economy changed to bitcoin hypothetically, how do you think anything would change?

Not sure if this is legit or not. I saw a list earlier that was only hash and cracked password, no account numbers or user names, but my pass was on that list. This list does not contain my admittedly trivially easy password.
