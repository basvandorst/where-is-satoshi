100% correct, although the "registration" isn't a simple process and requires **a lot** of effort.  Including getting tons of information about participants (which is going to be a no go).
This is kind of an expected development though, bitcoin is popular and there are very clear rules about transmitting money.  Somewhere along the line the US Government decided that BTC is money.
Unfortunately this will make transferring BTC in and out of USD substantially more difficult (expect all the other exchanges to be targeted as I haven't seen one that's in compliance).  I wonder what portion of the world will follow suit.
Also, if you are a US Citizen and you have made any significant profit on BTC I would recommend you either consult a tax attorney or pay at least capital gains (if not income) taxes on the money.  Otherwise you open yourself up to numerous problems once the IRS catches up with you... And they will be looking.
(Sorry to be a naysayer but it's how the US Government operates)

I was just thinking that the fees would typically get bumped up when users want to jump into the head of the queue, which would happen when the queue is long.
The circumstances leading to people paying higher fees are the same circumstances leading to increased wait time.

Assuming that this post ([link]( is accurate there are 2^160 possible addresses/private keys.  Just using the birthday paradox formula from appendix B ([link]( to get an idea of how many addresses need to exist to hit the birthday paradox number we see ~1.4e24 possible addresses required for a 50% chance of just *two* addresses matching.  Lets assume we can generate and check 1 trillion addresses a second that means only 44,000 years before there's a collision...
Absurdly large, however if there is some weird interaction going on that causes the output space to be limited that number could readily drop into the realm of reasonability.

Care to make a bet on that?  I'll paypal you $10 (USD) if the mt gox exchange rate closes higher on friday than open on monday, you paypal me $10 (USD) if the exchange rate closes lower on friday than it opened on monday.
I'm willing to bet on my prediction for the next week :)

Stop watching, this bubble has popped.  Keep your coins safe in place and just wait.
The price is slowly bouncing down to it's pre-bubble levels but the reality is that there will more than likely be another bubble in the coming months as the currency sees another spike of adoption.
Don't sell, don't give it away, don't watch obsessively, just wait.

Because my skin isn't in BTC right now.
My money is where my mouth is.  I'm hoping by the end of the month it'll hit my buy price again.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:14:04
Does it matter really?  Speedy adoption isn't necessary and it actually fuels instability in BTC prices (as we observed before).  I prefer a slow steady rise to predominant usage over a surge of idiots jumping on a bandwagon.
I avoid the word hacker in general but the core concept of that term as it originated (in MIT) is *exactly* what the Bitcoin developers did.

Vorter, you are quite the generous one.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:40:47
The birthday paradox creates a more representative answer from how large a randomly generated set you need in order to hit an arbitrary odds of a collision.

If it hits $250 again I would sell enough to cover you initial investment or 2x.  Then when it drops again (if) buy back.  Wash rinse repeat.

I was interested in bitcoin a few months ago right before the mania started.  I wasn't proactive and didn't buy any coins, then the price went insane and I held off because I didn't want to get stung.
Even once the bubble bottoms out (if it's like last time) the bump in adoption will lead to an average monthly return of ~20%.  Bitcoin is great if you buy it when everyone stops paying attention...
I'm thinking ~$60 is a good price.

I learned about RES a couple days ago after someone posted a screenshot of a comment.
I completely did not realize it wasn't a reddit product until this posting.  Thank you for your work, you have created an excellent application.

I really like the idea of your service but I turned away when I saw there were no details without registration.
You should put up an info page, available pre-registration, that explains all of the features offered by your service.
Sounds like a really good idea though.

I don't think the tax issue is that large of one as long as he treats the BTC as a cash equivalents (so just pay normal taxes on the service provided).  I'm not a tax attorney but from those that I've spoken with this issue is somewhat overblown.

Hey Ian, so one issue you'll encounter with trying to accept bitcoin as payment right now is that transactions take over 20 minutes to confirm.  As a smaller restaurant owner/operator I would not bother trying right now.
There's still room for a payment confirmation service in the market space.  Someone to act as a trusted intermediary to confirm that the BTC have been sent.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:30:38
In an efficient market there are no arbitrage opportunities.  Bitcoin is so far from efficient right now...

Currencies can't be FDIC insured (nor can investments if you want to call bitcoin that).
Akin to saying "but my keyboard doesn't have a screen protector!"  More a statement about the person making it than anything else...

I ran the numbers a while ago, if the generation algorithm were truly random the odds of a collision (based on the birthday paradox) was absurdly low.  This is a *strong* indication of a flawed implementation somewhere, depending on what proportion of the wallets use this implementation it may be feasible to--nevermind, nothing, I'm going to go write some code now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:03:46
"Confirmed" just means that the transaction has been added to the blockchain (think of it like the permanent record of transactions).
For larger transactions you'd want to have a couple blocks completed after the transaction to ensure that someone can't try to reverse the transaction.  As cowboy coder pointed out it's unlikely someone would attempt to reverse a transaction (or double spend) for a restaurant bill given that it's such a smal amount.

bitfloor is trading at ~$96.5/BTC.  If you bought $5k worth of BTC the price would move up by ~$2/BTC.
MtGox is trading at $95.2/BTC (I can't find the cumulative volume charts but I imagine you'd have less price impact).  
On a $5000 investment that would be a difference of 1.8 BTC, not that substantial really.
Were I you I'd wait to buy in, or maybe only buy ~$2.5K right now, the price will probably still drop.

In the long run the barrier to entry for bitcoin needs to drop to zero.  The problem here was that it dropped too much too quickly and caused a speculative bubble.
In the long run, if we want to see bitcoin as a stable currency, it needs to have a steady liquidity demand.  A minimal barrier to entry is the only way to ensure that happens.  The problem we observed here was that the currency wasn't being used for it's advantageous transaction properties but as a speculative investment.

I would vote the 5.  I think Satoshi as an outline of a shadowy figure with a question mark for the 0.1 would be appropriate
