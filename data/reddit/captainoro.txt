This is good for Bitcoin

You must be an absolute idiot to think an actual felon who forked into an alt-coin, 2 months ago lol, who believes insider trading against YOU is ok, will ever have your best interests at heart. Like, a genuine idiot. Try thinking objectively for 5 seconds, you're an idiot. You can't be anything but. Get your head out of your arse and read the first sentence to yourself again. Otherwise it's a game you simply can't win.

Thanks for putting him in his place, The moment you present even an ounce of quantitative reasoning to 's wayward postulation, he backtracks with "wait and see", and counters with 'IMO's, and the 1/10 darts that managed to hit the board.
Weak :)

I think by this point it's well established is a troll user with zero credentials whatsoever
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:54:54
You're basically a total idiot then, by the union of your own admission and definition.
These bcash shills try so hard it makes me laugh to think they care about this as a money source so much.
Ver-min has no credentials, he's a felon who forked then started shilling a centralized coin, 2 months ago lol. You can only be an idiot too to think he has your interests in mind. He cares about himself, long before he'll ever care about anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:52:35
LOL, most definitely a tard of extraordinary proportions.
: No poster on this subreddit, nor any casual reader/lurker who chances upon will ever believe an iota of the nonsense you have chosen to spew in this thread. 
Thanks for playing :D

As well as I managed to keep a balanced view throughout this thread, you sure did well to disappoint the argument you tried to put forth.

S/F = Store of Falue
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:02:17
Eh, I'm willing to bet in line with this prediction, so that's something
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:04:02
Let me think...
Yeah it's probably worth it.
That's what I think.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:25:46
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:53:48
The two aren't mutually exclusive
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:25:51
I'm also very interested in this particular question. Can I ask what processes develop this sort of scenario?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:17:23
How do you define rich?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:18:51
I see.
Then, maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:07:21
Surely that can only happen if the amount in question changes.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:07:29
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:46:39
You're just alluding to an increase in value in the limit of Bitcoin's inception...
By that definition, everything with any current value at all would have increased by a similar amount since it began, namely infinite percent. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:36:38
Serious question but who is they?
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:48:42
OK thanks dude! /s
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:48:59
Thus the weakminded individual slithers back into hiding ^^^ 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:42:15
At no point did OP suggest or even insinuate that the hashrate has to keep going up "ad infinatum" as you put it.
Downvoted

I'm genuinely curious: Could you link your sources for this please?
This is a pretty assertive statement to make, so I'm confident you have material to support both the action and Peterson's underlying motivation... After all, making something like this up would just be ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:34:58
Are you going to support this with an objective interpretation of his motivations, proof of causality, etc etc etc?
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:35:36
Eckhart Tolle's cheery, geeky brother
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:58:28
How, exactly, am I moving the goal posts? I'm just asking for the same information I requested in my original post.


I'd love to know how you drew these conclusions. I duly remove all political and ideological leaning from my posts where appropriate - at least this way I can maintain a balanced view on a given subject. The same reason I've taken an appropriate amount of time to listen to some of Peterson's speeches and interviews in the first place.
How you came to those conclusions about me I have no idea. Anything deemed a personal attack won't exactly help your cause.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:08:50
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:18:41
Probably because a lot less people give a crap about those
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:57:21
Poor grammar makes an article tough to take seriously
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:50:29
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:56:42
LOL you really need to fix the tilt buddy
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:13:04
Understandable that he'd say that
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:29:44


Could you post any facts/figures supporting this claim? I'm genuinely curious about any statistics on the demographics that think well of him.
Obviously I know you're not going to misrepresent the data backing your argument, by focusing exclusively on a subset of social categories which might tarnish his reputation.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:32:23
This user seems passionately in favour of misrepresenting the man in question. She's failed on basic propositional logic, and reading comprehension in other posts here
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:47:53
I'm genuinely curious: Could you post some sources quoting the people you're referring to?
You sound pretty adamant, so I assume they exist. 
Honestly, thanks v much :)
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:59:32
My own experiences make me inclined to agree with this
