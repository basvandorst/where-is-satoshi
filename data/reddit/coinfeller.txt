*throws up* 
Wtf is this design?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:30:51
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:46:24
That's why I stopped using it :(
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:59
I don't see the point of making everyone aware of the bcash rebranding. Bitcoin cash community is growing and they won't stop saying bitcoin cash. I really love crypto, this wars are totally useless now. We can win together.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:20:33
Ok. Let me put it this way:
Nobody is confused by Bitcoin cash except r/Bitcoin and it's thought police. Kapish?
Bitcoin cash is a different name than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:35:47
Ok i see your point. Yes it's alarming to see that Wall Street is here while Bitcoin was designed against them in the first place. What bothers me is that the only thing that matters is price right now. 
Steam stopped using Bitcoin a few days ago which I found much more alarming than futures.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:38:46
Yep :) 
I already have been accused of being paid for the same type of comments you wrote above ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:10:43
Follow the unconfirmed transaction here:
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:03:03
Parity will be found with mempool soon ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:56:03
Or maybe you should grow up and try to focus on something useful?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:23:35
I thought I was the only paid shill around here! ��
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:46:00
Biggest threat for Bitcoin is r/bitcoin mods
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:33:05
Nice argument, care to elaborate ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:11:15
Fees would never be high if Bitcoin could scale
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:44:48
Community should just fight for commerce adoption, it was the only plan at the beginning: buying stuff with crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:31:50
Please do some extensive research! Don't let one guy on reddit stop you from finding the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:26:29
It's only spam if you disagree ;) 
Anyway, no one will stop saying Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin. So keep going ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:45:21
Past price gives no indication of future price. Value is not driven by the past
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:00:24
I'm just stating a simple fact: if you can read, you can see the difference of two set of words. But maybe it's hard for you to understand this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:34:40
You're right! It will be interesting to watch
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:43:48
You can store offline with a ledger nano s or a trezor, if you can afford it (I use ledger nano s personally)
You can also use an app like bread to store your bitcoin on your phone which is also very safe (I use bread on iOS don't know about android)
Coinbase stores your private keys: this means that they hold your money for you. If coinbase goes down, your money is lost. That is why you need a personal wallet.
Remember : no private key, no money.
Personally, i have a few money on websites like coinbase and exchanges, most of my money is offline.
Also, be careful of sending money to the wrong address. When in doubt send the smallest amount you can to check that your transaction is correct.
Let me know if this clears things up
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:54
It's true, never seen a "Thank you Roger" on top or It's weird we spend so much time talking about one guy. As if Bitcoin was limited to Adam Back, Ver, Jihan, Andreas, etc. Fuck this
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:05:53
Issue is that if you have a ton of LN nodes that closes on the same time because people want to get back their money, you will have a ton of unconfirmed transaction on chain. Back to square 1.
LN also increases centralization, which what Bitcoin was against in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:56:38
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:15:47
What happens if you lose 90% of your hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:52:20
Hello, obviously you live on the planet mars so here is the news: 
Can we stop with this childish fight now?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:05:54
I stopped using BTC because of this. Here you can look unconfirmed tx:
Bitcoin allows 7 transaction per second
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:18:05
Wait that futures kicks in then will talk
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:45:03
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:00:21
I don't know, probably you will have to wait that the mempools clears up
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:09:30
No offense but telling people to stop using their money sounds really extreme to me
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:38
There is no cult in r/btc from what I've read. However, I find it sad that top posts of r/bitcoin are people bragging about buying a lambo and new posts are about newbies losing money on fees and stress about transaction time. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:27:06
Thanks for your answer.
I would love to debate with you about that matter, but I think users should focus on being users, not miners or tech experts. So I don't see this as a problem if the network is distributed among companies and not decentralized to every users.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:38:43
What about Bitcoin gold then? Ethereum Classic? I can't believe how dumb this argument is. 
You just get triggered because Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin, am I right ? :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:57:28
Sucks to hear this, you probably have to wait more... 200k unconfirmed transaction right now :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:41:54
oops ! you're right! thanks :) just wanted to have a debate about adoption here
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:30
On chain scaling is a viable solution today. Metrics given in this debate would imply to have a huge market adoption right now with thousands of Tx/second, which is not the case so your argument is invalid.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:15:40
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:43:25
thank you for your answer
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:06:59
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:47:12
I've never read anything more dumb than this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:03:22
Is that important ?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:15:56
"The other sub" you sound like a cheated spouse
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:01:31
Character assassination is a despicable trend in this community.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:28:42
I don't understand why there is such a heavy moderation here. Bitcoin is about freedom, not about being banned if you don't fit the narrative.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:42:47
That would include them in the global economy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:43:48
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:38:26
Is this sub only circle jerk about price?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:58:01
yes ! Free will is the best
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:03:05
Can you elaborate? I'm not here to discuss other coins than btc, so please give me arguments.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:51:36
I can't seem to understand how on earth you can see toxicity while people are trying to defend a brand? Why is it toxic?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:25:56
No I disagree. It's not nonsense, since you defend so vehemently the immutability of bitcoin make it impossible to add new features. This is because you seem to defend your own agenda.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:04:19
Zero technical content is untrue, have you watched it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:09
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:09
No it's only about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:43:59
I would say that consciously putting the brand of your competitor is the worst move you can do. You guys are desperate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:54
Yes but I did'nt mention any other coin, only bitcoin! What is wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:00:37
Such momentum! Wow
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:39:49
Is this sub only focused on destroying competition instead of building its own stuff? This is getting ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:37:49
Around 20 min he talks about lightning network, segwit and quadratic hashing: it's technical stuff for me. But I'm not a techie, so maybe it's not technical for you.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:49:24
Only a sith deals in absolute!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:56:11
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:01:16
BCH went 50% up since you posted this pic, that didn't age well
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:38:30
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:33:10
Making BCH a top post is always shooting yourself in the foot, i don't understand why you guys are talking about BCH that much.
And i thought that it was censored to talk about altcoins around here, so it's really confusing
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:30
You can call it whatever you want, it's not important. I don't know what is a sockpuppet, I've been in crypto for 3 months. I just want to debate that's all :(
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:49:26
Bitcoin core is Bcore! Okay?
