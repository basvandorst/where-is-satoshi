So you’re saying it’s impossible and that I’m the one saying retarded stuff. Interesting.

I don’t think you understand how much a 2% fee is robbing from you. These banks are making risk free money hand over fist off of your dime and you are the one taking all the risk. Also, these crypto markets aren’t guaranteed to get returns close to that ever again. Although crypto had a huge rise, I’ll bet it will be balanced out by a huge fall.

They just want to try and set you up with the right type of investment account is all. They just want a profile because their account managers try to make a “personal connection” with you. Investment firms are also old school. 
I went through the hiring process at Edward Jones after I got my finance degree out of college and they touted their sales tactic: door to door sales. I noped out of there so fast. 
I hadn’t really read into the crypto market a whole lot as I mostly go into blue chip stocks. However seeing as how they have bitcoin “index funds” of sorts, that changes my opinion of it completely.

Yeah, but passive Index funds have been proven to outperform actively managed mutual funds/hedge funds. So you are essentially throwing your money away.

Is $8,000 not a significant barrier to entry?
