And again general sense of this statement is "wait a little, we are still working on it". Why do you call it breaking news?

Welcome! And good luck! I am certainly not a leading expert on Bitcoin.  I am perhaps best described as an “early adopter”, so I am glad to another one "early adopter" here in the 'ocean' with experts.

I'm afraid they will never accept BTC. It not worth trying
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:39:25
I don't believe there are any Bitcoin startups in NY and that likely isn't a coincidence.   
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:36:02
It's fake.. No Caribbean country recognizes Bitcoin as a Currency yet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:01:31
Hilarious pic! very sad reality by the way

No charge-back risk and small tx fees are huge advantage from the seller's point of view. But they should share the benefits with the buyers by offering discounts for bitcoin payments. They still would pay less fees (comparing to cc payments) and buyers are happy to save some money. Everybody wins.

Any links to official report?

such a bad feeling when you believe that your brother is many times smarter than you are

Banking be definition is generally boring. The amount they can earn is low, but they use leverage to allow them to make more money

kuwait finance firm.. i really doubt they are good guys. they just want the US to keep their paws off of influencing everything in the mideast.

It's pretty typical how courts and governments will classify Bitcoin as whatever they feel, suits them for the given situation.
When it suits them to classify it as a currency, they do so.   When it suits them for taxation, it is considered property or an asset.   When we are talking about money laundering, then all the sudden it is cash.
Whatever is best for the government, and costs the most for it's people, that is how they classify Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:11:41
I don't think that it will just do harm to the BTC community
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:02:49
Nice a part 3 Thanks for sharing it and ah Zoltar I feel old for getting that reference I wonder if it can take bitcoin  
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:01:53
Bitcoin is hardly anonymous in itself...

It doesn't seem like CIA is controlling the Bitcoin system, does it?
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:36:33
If they are meant to be sent to me by some mad bitcoin millionaire or some kind of bitcoin lottery9aka not fruit of years of work):
10 BTC to giveaways that will make BiPolarBob's deals seems like common ones.
Some bitcoins to invest in something
Wharever left I will put on freezer for cold storage
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:49:48
Indeed I do remember it quite well. It was handled in a good manner.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:43:26
Maybe it would be a lessno for a mass media not to ruin someone's life or a least to think what are you doing. Seems like they WRITE and TALK a lot and THINK a little 
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:16:45
Shitty gambling adverts from people's signatures. You do nothing to promote a positive all inclusive image of Bitcoin by pandering and trying to profit from others vices/addictions.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:54:16
In last few days there was a lot of posts about goverment/banks wants to control BTC. As it is quickly growing market it will attract more attention in future. So it's just the beginning
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:10:08
Looks like you are right, after I read about the problems I checked it by myself and so I the transaction didn't pass 
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:02:22

I used to watch UFC and that is pretty cool Smiley
I'm not big into donating, but I would if an athlete advertised it some how, especially if its on clothing as you say.
I shall check out your link.
Wierd though.. thought most UFC peoples were already covered with certain sponsors ?
this guy a very new person ??

We  should give this brilliant idea to Manager of the restaurant
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:42:26
I would also agree with it in this case! Good point that blockhain is not so powerful to support millions of transactions per sec
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:15:58
What about "BTC"?
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:29:37
People who want banks should just use cash.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:28:30
railway station is a nice place to have ATMs, but there many questions to them, can I exchange btc for cash for example?
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:06:48
Agree! But billdoard itself is a good commercial) 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:22:47
Ok, thanks for noticing about rumors about the site, will spend some time to read more about it's reputation 
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:58:34
there are lots of other very good sites telling about bitcoin everything
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:56:18
Who is fucking Karpeles? Posts about him are everywhere!

I hope it will be more merchant apps for Android soon!

Braintree is a subsidiary of PayPal. It doesn't mean PayPal completely embrace BTC. There are many factors to be considered, such as state regulation, security etc.
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:39:26
Does France hava a Bitcoin legal right? How operators considered legal?

I've always liked Dell. A 10% discount is pretty good and a great incentive to use the coins. How long does this offer last? I could do with a new PC or laptop.
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:49:44
probably just a recycled email address. original one would have being cleared out after period of non use. Its just a troll looking for attention.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:01:58
it's not the most relevant information
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:49:23
Bitcoin conference in NC? Hot damn, hope I can make it there!
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:44:10
Kind of open up all kind of fund raising issue if they do that. There are rules for taking money and limit on how much money politician can accept per person
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:29:17
Honestly, please someone tell me how wrong this is: I would create an electrum wallet. Memorize the seed. Repeat it to myself everyday. and ALSO keep it on a piece of paper in two different locations in a safe or so.

Finally, the goverment decided to cooperate with a business owners who are wiiling to accept BTC. BTC can replace U.S.dollars in future, so it's better for the Federal Reserve to know more about their "enemy"
