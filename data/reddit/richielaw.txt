Dude. Do NOT sell at a loss. Just don't. If you don't have strong hands then don't use money you can't afford to lose.

Tax cuts helped with wealthy and large corporations. They did not help the small guy. 
Dropping the Obamacare penalty doesn't help people either because it provides less reason for people to have insurance which makes the whole marketplace more expensive for every one else. 
And Trump has done nothing to help the economy. He inherited it from Obama and is trying his best to run it into the ground with his stupid tariffs and trade wars.

What is one thing that Trump has done to 'help' the little guy?

Then take your money that you want to use for mining and purchase Bitcoin. 
The amount you want to invest will NEVER make more Bitcoin than what it could purchase today.

I'll sell everything except my eth. Let's not forget that eth was as high as .14 BTC at one point. I'd wait for it to get back to that before I would sell for BTC. Look how much it has grown just in the past 6 hours.
Personally I could give a fuck about USD value. I've lost 15% of that nut gained 20% in btc.

There is a difference between FinCEN guidelines for MSB's and state money transmitter laws. The FinCEN guidelines are for money laundering purposes, whereas the money transmitter licenses are more to protect consumers. Theoretically, the kiosk as envisioned prior to this development does not hold anything of customer value. You purchase and sell bitcoins only. The operator sells bitcoins in its possession and then receives fiat for them. That fiat then goes from customer money to operator money. There is no money transmission. 
With this development, you have de facto money transmission going on with the kiosks which presents an exponentially larger regulatory requirement. The operator by being a "branch" is holding customer money and property and the states will want to protect the customers. The best part of Robocoin was that you were not holding onto customer bitcoin or fiat. You could go perform your transaction and now you're done. The holding of bitcoins opens up robocoin and the operators up to a serious amount of additional liability. 
I personally think this was a stupid move to try to bring bitcoin inline with modern banks.

This. The company has now made these kiosks into normal ATMs and will subject the owners to egregious regulatory requirements. Before you could argue that the kiosks are not ATMs and simply exchange property (per the IRS). This will make all transactions even more subject to Banking regulations and guidelines. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:56:56
Thank you for the link. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:41:12
Question: How does this coincide with the FinCEN guidance? My understanding is that bitcoin businesses are forced to comply with banking regulation requirements, yet if bitcoins are a commodity/property and not currency, should a bitcoin business be forced to treat bitcoin as a currency for purposes of money regulations? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:26:27
The regulatory environment. A lot of state's are not sure how to license bitcoin related companies. For instance, Illinois has a moratorium on bitcoin related money-transmitter licenses because they just don't know how to deal with them yet so they are sticking their heads in the sand. 
If you want to do things the right way, and make everything legal, you need to jump through the hoops. Some states are more progressive than others, see Texas (shockingly). 
Now all that is further complicated by this development.

If you are getting advice from an accountant who is adequately insured, what red flags are you talking about? Cash it out via coinbase and pay your taxes. End of story. You're not doing anything illegal, why try to hide it. 
I've known people to cash out tens of thousands of dollars in crypto without any worries at all.

Cost average savings. Pick an amount and put it in BTC each paycheck. Do that till it hits a million a bitcoin. You'll see pretty massive gains. Even if you're only putting in 50 a paycheck. 
Ether is actually really undervalued to now. But people need to stop waiting for 10000% gains. Invest now. What you can afford to lose. Preferably on a schedule. Don't throw your life savings into it. If history is a viable teacher this shit is going to crash and it is going to crash hard. Stock up then. But buy now.

I did start the sync on my first computer on an old node. I had not synced core in about 47 weeks. That was a disaster so I went to my wife's comp which was newer and did not have bitcoin core installed on it. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:00:30
My hardware has never had a problem with bitcoin core till recently. I've tried on both computers. One with a six core AMD 3.2 GHZ and another with a two core 2.8GHZ Intel. Both computers have 8 GB RAM. 
Also, in both cases the data files are on newish hard drives.

The other one would not get past 2 years. 
And as it happens I was able to get Core running. I updated the OP: 
So I finally got it to sync. I'm not sure if I did anything different, I just kept on restarting my computer after each time it crashed and it finally got current. I have no idea what changed as I did not change any settings or run core from the command line. I'm completely lost with this piece of software.
Still have no idea what changed or why it started working. But it did. And it is.

FWIW - I purchased an order and this is what I'm banking on. There was a HUGE demand for the Avalon chips and these exceed them by quite a bit. 
The chips are being produced and the main delays were a result of board issues. I'm hopeful that the board schematics and other information being released will encourage hobbyists to start DIY kits or other services like they are doing with the Avalon chips. Either way I think they'll be a product to sell.

I do like the interface (when it is up) but I can't stand how the prices are so different from other exchanges. Yesterday bitstamp and btc-e and even Mt.

@_date: 2013-06-02 19:25:20
Just luck my friend. If I would have known about bitcoin a year ago I would have bought several BFL machines. I didn't get into btc until mid-April of this year. It took too long to get money into an exchange during the climb up and right before I purchased btc it crashed. 
I have been very, very lucky with timing. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:55:10

@_date: 2013-06-02 20:29:14
It is actually considerably lower than what they are going for in most of the auctions. Those are approaching $500 or even more. 
It is what the market will bear. These things are very expensive per G/Hash so I am selling some of these to pay for the ones that I am going to use mining. A lot of people do not have access to or the knowledge of the group buys, further I have been offering international shipping and free shipping to those in the US. 
I also have them in my possession and can ship immediately. 
So it works for some people.

@_date: 2013-10-22 17:29:39
I'm sure I'm going to be down-voted to hell for this, but here goes: 
By using bitcoin you're making a business decision that bitcoin value will stay static or increase over time. Either that or you'll need to be willing to wait for bitcoin to increase in value prior to cashing out your bitcoins should the value crash. 
Bitcoin is volatile and there is a real risk that you could sell a product for .5 BTC when it is at $200 per BTC and then prior to changing that to fiat, the value could crash to $90. You've lost over half your value in an instant. 
Further, it depends upon your location. It is becoming harder and harder to get bitcoin into fiat in the US. It could take days or even weeks to get that money into your bank account. 
So, it really depends on your business goals and the profit margin of your goods. If you have a slim profit margin then BTC might be very risky. 
Now, if you believe in bitcoin and are willing to just save it till it pops and do not need fiat for the running of your business or dispersing profits in fiat, then you can feel free to ignore everything I've just said.
Regardless, good luck. 
EDIT - Was reading some of the other comments and went over to coinbase and saw that they are offering instant conversion to fiat. That would allay most of my concerns above. I'm leaving them up there for sake of clarity in regards to this edit. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:52:56
True. I actually just saw them on another thread in the subreddit. I do like their site, but to be honest I was looking for an exchange with a little bit more market depth as I'm hoping to leverage down the cost of my BTC holdings by playing the dips.

Hmmm. I would be interested in some feedback on this as well. I can't seem to find anything outside of their own produced content on the net....
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:30:49
That is a question that I'm still thinking about. I am actually averaged at about $96-105 a BTC right now. I would probably sell some if it reaches $110.
I do believe in the value of bitcoin and I think that it definitely going to go higher. The questions are:
1. Will it be another 6 month climb? 
2. Will there be ways to buy bitcoin if you're American in 6 months? 
So, I probably would kept more of it in fiat if there weren't concerns with regulatory agencies freezing exchanges. It is a risk, but this is money that I'm not reliant on to live and something that I can honestly be patient waiting for.

I know!! My move yesterday seems to have paid off. I'm not sure if I'm lucky or good, but I'll take either!

@_date: 2013-06-12 14:37:44
I have been thinking the same thing. I worry that the share price will crash if the dividends stop being so large....

Thanks for this. I'd be interested in more of a technical explanation of how you plot your trend lines. If you wouldn't mind explaining, or if you could point me in the direction of some material to study I would appreciate it.
Now, I've been posting about that I feel that the market is going to crash again, at least to 80/75 before this storm of volatility settles. What are your thoughts on that? 
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:46:31
I did. We'll see if anything comes up. I also updated the OP as I found a thread of someone who had their paypal account frozen for selling bitcoin mining hardware. 
Apparently it is against the TOS since at least mid-May to sell anything to do bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:18:13
Yeah. I'm actually okay with the size as I feel it gives you added security against the difficulty increase.

I feel you. To be honest, I'm not advocating a sell now and buy later approach. I'm just curious as to thoughts on whether the price will crash or not. 
Btw, if you're still holding AM you might see a bump in share price over the coming months.

True, but their Jupiter is about 5k less than what it would cost to buy 5 25GH/s machines from BFL. It also comes with a 2000$ voucher for the Jupiter.
My assumption is that they are using this money to purchase product materials for the Jupiters.

Yeah, I should probably do that. My PSU has been on overdrive lately. If anything below 85 is fine then I shouldn't have a problem. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:14:26
I don't that. That is the rub. I think in order for btc to be used as a currency it needs to maintain at least a constant value. Right now merchants using it are gambling that the value will increase, or dealing with processors that directly exchange bitcoin for fiat. 
In order for it to reign as currency it will need to be used as currency, e.g. when you purchase something for bitcoin from a merchant it goes into a bitcoin wallet, not a processor who exchanges the bitcoin for fiat. 
As far as your last question, I think that when mining peaks and an increase in demand, you will see a MASSIVE value increase in bitcoin. I think bitcoin becomes valuable as a currency when the block rewards are small and the value large.

That is really only a good idea when there is no volatility. How can you go to someone and say, "you should buy this umbrella for .1 BTC" when one week that umbrella cost 10$ and the next week it cost 90. 
You will not see widespread use of bitcoin as a currency until the volatility stops.

I've been saying this for a while, but I do think there will be another bubble bursting. I'm not saying this because I do not believe in bitcoin but from a market perspective the rise is too high with too little support. 
Yes, we have had a round of amazing press and media lately, but there is still not enough merchant support to have this high of a price point for BTC. Just last week it was at 55! 
Further, there has been the entrance of very wealthy people and corporations into bitcoin. They have become market movers and will be actively influencing the price of BTC. This is a completely unregulated market with no rules, it is very easy for them to do a classic "pump and dump". 
I'm not sure what the ceiling will be or what the corresponding floor is, but it will definitely be interesting to see how it all plays out.

That is a great point. That being said, I feel that an increase dealing with such a larger starting point (in $) would preclude such a large percentage increase in the future. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:04:59
Yeah. Maybe. I'm sure that has been said before and to be honest, part of me hopes you are right. I have about 25 BTC in cold storage just waiting for it to really pop, but I had averaged the rest of my holdings to about 75/BTC and sold between 130-145. I'm happy with my gains and do not regret selling at all. 
I do think that the market is going to crash again. There is too much volatility (prime example from earlier today). If the crash is sustained just a little bit longer then it might very well drop sub-100 and even further to sub-80. But this is all conjecture....
Good luck to you as well!

I got an email and trying to transfer into Mt. Gox with Dwolla is not allowed. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:29:59
This ^. I look at it this way. 
1. If you believe in BTC and want to hold out for value over the long-term, take the money you can afford to throw away and buy BTC. Put it in a secure location and back up your wallet.dat file. Then promptly fucking forget about it.
2. If you are looking at making profit off of the market volatility, then you have to make decisions. Sell when you think it is high and then keep fiat in an exchange to purchase when you think it is low. Don't panic anything. You know BTC can get up to $250 a coin and was $160 a coin a couple of days ago. Wait till you see the price you want. 
If you don't get that price, adjust your expectations and start over.
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:47:05

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:33:04
I know! I'm thanking my lucky stars! 
I think it is a great buying opportunity. I think there is rampant speculation akin to penny stocks. You are starting to have individuals and entities who can act as market movers and affect price. I think it would be worthwhile to ride out the dips and wait for the inevitable climbs. 
In addition, BTC and LTC are finite resources. Even if the technology only exists in the periphery of currencies, the price should go up as supply decreases. 
But then again it could all be declared worthless tomorrow. :)

@_date: 2013-04-21 02:05:31
Completely agree with That being said, you do not have to buy BTC in whole increments. If you REALLY want to invest, then take an amount of money that will not impact your finances and savings. Even if it is only $10 a week, you can still purchase some BTC. 
Granted, if you do not have a savings or are living beyond your means, then a risky investment like this is definitely not something you should partake in. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:02:58
I was referring to the chips. They have a firm date that my purchase is contingent upon. I do not have any skin in the game for their rig production. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:56:52

I do agree. Although when will the volatility end? With the mining of the last BTC? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:41:43
I think it will get close to previous lows of $70/$65. I've been saying this for a couple of weeks now. If it does I'll stock up again after selling at $115-$140. 
I don't think it will go below that as that floor was tested and held firm twice. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:27:55
I'm in the USA as well. I'm currently looking at options to put the chips in an actual rig and falling a little flat to be honest. I don't trust myself to DIY and the thread above with someone making the rigs wants 80 euro per 10 chips, which for any actual amount of hashing power is quite a lot of money.

I just increased my holdings by about 70% so I'm hoping that it is. Indicators seem to point in that direction. 
A more interesting question is where do we see the next peak. The last peak was at about 160$. I'm thinking if we see a large spike it is going to move to 185-200$.
