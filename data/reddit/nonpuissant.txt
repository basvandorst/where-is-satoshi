Not only that, when cars did become mainstream, the early car owners were simply left with an older, inferior car while everyone else was driving around in new ones.

Yet. That could always change though. To loosely use the early adoption of cars analogy that's been floating around, BTC might not end up being the best car around since a new manufacturer/model might come along and replace it.

Yo, I've noticed that before too. Do you have any insight into why that is? I always interpreted it as an extra long verbal pause, but always wondered if there was some other meaning/intent to it since it makes the rhythm a bit odd sometimes.

Possibly, yeah. BTC could be like buying Ford stocks, but it could also be like buying [Auburn]( stocks as well.  
There are a lot of unknowns still since crypto is so new. BTC may end up reigning supreme, or it might end up merely an entry in history books as a revolutionary turning point. We'll just have to wait and see. Just because something is first doesn't guarantee that it will last.

That's my point. It's not only the bleeding edge early adopters that benefit from new technology.  


I didn't say 'left behind with', I said 'left with' - whether or not someone had the means and desire to upgrade is beside the point. The resources they spent on the first car were tied up in that car until they could liquidate it, and with the ramped up production you mentioned it only ever got harder to do so. Wealthy people had the option to simply eat the cost and buy a new one, of course.    
Overall point being that a lot of these memes poking fun at people not investing in BTC specifically come from an assumption that BTC will remain the one supreme crypto in the long run. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. I'm not well-versed enough to make any predictions about that, but historically speaking most technological leaps branch since that is indeed how innovation works.
