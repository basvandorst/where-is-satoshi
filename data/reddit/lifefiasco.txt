Just do like the "magic eye" posters and save yourself some cash.

Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that...
These posts are not new, and a vital part of the community.
You can keep your “play nice” attitude.
I’ve been around here for years, censorship is not welcome.
Sincerely from me.  Go Fuck Yourself!

Just please tell me you aren't keeping it inside...
Please visit r/Bonsai if this is your first tree.
If the tip is as brown as it looks she is already beyond rescue.
Unlike bitcoin's demise this isn't FUD...

Please keep reading...  I don't think you begin to understand what Bonsai is.
I will put this as gently as possible.  No malice intended.
Your post reads like an article talking about the "CEO of Bitcoin".
Your tree is likely already dead.  By the time a juniper starts to show browning it's been long dead.
There are tons of unscrupulous sellers who will go as far as to paint trees green.
The same sellers prey on unsuspecting buyers and tell them they are indoor trees.
Think of it as buying "bitcoin" and getting a few "coins" made of wood with a lowercase "b" stamp.

I paid out within an hour no issues... Go figure...

I hope this actually happens.
The last thing we need is another bitcoin scam site.
Not that I'm saying this is, mind you.

Once I registered and logged in I only get a blank green screen with the site name and my username at the top...

I agree I have standing orders in the single digits just for fun.
