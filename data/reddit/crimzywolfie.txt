I'm not sure what exchange you're on, but I'm in the US and on Binance  and I didn't have to link a bank account. If I'm buying crypto on an  exchange, I'd just get a prepaid card and pay that way.

He said electoral votes. America is not a democracy, I don’t know why everyone keeps getting that wrong.

Well if you're buying **that** much bitcoin, why would you use a centralized exchange when you could use P2P like Bisq?
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:53:04
This is why you use non-KYC exchanges.

So it's mayhem when there is no government/authority, but it's not mayhem to put those same people in power to rule over us.

As with every decision you make, there are consequences to that action/inaction. In this case, human trafficking and rape of any kind is against the NAP (non-aggression principle) and you have the right to defend yourself from the perpetrators, but you seem familiar with the ideology so honestly I don't even know why you brought it up knowing I was going to knock that down. As for "slave labour" if both parties consent, then it's not slavery. Why anyone would want to be in that kind of situation is beyond me. 


Never said that it was unnatural.


That's the problem, *everyone doesn't* *have the same interests*. Some people are pro-gun, some people aren't. Some people are pro-LGBT some aren't I could go on. In a democracy everyone has to agree (which is impossible) in order to be this ideal society you believe it to be. Again, democracy doesn't care about the minority. If I held a vote to rob the rich and the rich were the minority and everyone who isn't rich says yes. I have a feeling you wouldn't be in support of that even though the solution was made democratically. I highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with *The Trial of Socrates*, genuinely interested in your response. 


*Tyranny -*  
*Unjust or oppressive governmental power.*  
*Arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power; despotic abuse of authority.*
*The government or rule of a tyrant or absolute ruler.*
*Tyrant -* 
*A sovereign or other ruler who uses power oppressively or unjustly.*  
*Any person in a position of authority who exercises power oppressively or despotically.*
Yeah I know what tyranny means, rest assured. I'm legitimately posing these questions to you with the expectation of a meaningful response. The least you could do is answer them and not brush me off as a "moron-troll".

Use a wallet that allows you **to set** a lower fee ex: Electrum.

No, I'm not. Politicians only care about their self interests, not yours nor mine. How long have we've been speaking out for criminal justice reform, and to hold police accountable to their actions again? But I digress.


6. The minority gets f\*\*\*ed over, whoever has the most people on their side wins. 


This is tailored to be an argument towards other forms of government but not so much to anarchism, in an anarchic society, everyone self-regulates and tends to their own. If anyone wants to be taken care of by someone else it is done by free association and no authoritative figure imposing others to conform to their views.


Yes there is, majority wins, minority loses. Every time.


You are either a ruler or a subject, pick one. You can't elect a ruler and not be their subjects.
The problem with democracy is that although it sounds good to most people it can easily be used to force other to comply and submit unto the majority's will. This is why we don't have democratic elections and an electoral college. Anarchism is the complete opposite, offering the most individual freedoms than any other form of government. I prefer this than any other.
Democracy is tyranny of the majority, anarchism offers freedom in it's purist form.

License to sell/buy bitcoin? Why does *anyone* need to have a license to trade *their* crypto?

Buy gift cards, then buy bitcoins with said gift cards.

On Binance, you don't have to do KYC if you're trading under 2 BTC. Just don't give them your info.

On certain issues, yes, some things aren't dichotomies like political parties for example. Let's go with the pro-gun vs anti-gun issue, if a law is proposed to limit the guns people could buy, you're telling me that there's a middle position to take? The best "middle position" is indifference but indifference has no say in a vote.


Define gun reform. Also, it's naive to believe that gun reform *doesn't* take away guns from people. Mainstream media after a mass shooting it's **always** calls for the banning of "assault weapons". Even though statistically [more gun violence is committed with handguns](


This sentence contradicts itself. Ridicule requires for there to be a fairly high amount of coverage.
I take it you've just ignored my response in regard to the Trial of Socrates, because that's a pretty damning piece of history antithetical to your worldview. But hey, as evidenced by the fact you've downvoted all of my comments, I don't think you're here for an honest discussion in the first place.

The earlier the better, but keep in mind that you should spend only what you could afford to lose. As for storing your bitcoin, **do not** store them on web wallets and exchanges; Poloniex is a good example of what happens when you do. Most importantly, if you do not have access to the private key of your wallet, you don't have control over your coins.

Hardware Wallet &gt; Paper Wallet &gt; Software Wallet &gt; Online Wallet &gt; Exchange Wallet
Preferably you’ll want to move your coins to a hardware wallet but if you can’t, paper wallets are good, and second in line are software wallets like Electrum. When people say “Not your keys, not your bitcoin” we’re talking about the private keys of the bitcoin address. The private keys grants the ability to control the funds of the address in a wallet that supports it without having to move the funds into another address. An exchange will NOT give you access to this which is why it’s such a high risk to store any of your coins there for the long term. Hope this helped.

If you import your wallet to [blockchain.info]( you can manually set your fees there.
