This is a lie. Bitcoin died. This is what all the experts on Facebook keep telling me every fucking time it loses a dollar

As I stated on another thread, I lost about £160 over the convenience of the online wallet. Of course I was putting it into a trusted third party wallet, just so happens the day I go to take it out someone beat me to it lol. While I can make that money back in 9 to 10 days, it's still a large sum to vanish into thin air.
The people I feel sorry for the most is the poor and the students etc who put huge time into some much needed extra cash with low end systems and got taken for a ride :/

I genuinely feel bad for the people who picked some up only to forget about them or sell them way too early

Annnd it's back
Bitcoin does that folks, calm the fuck down.
Although it is always amusing watching the media knowing nothing and claiming through death of bitcoin every time it drops a dollar

I accept on my youtube channel still but I prefer knowing who has donated so I can thank them! So it's just there as another option really but I do talk about crypto a bunch
