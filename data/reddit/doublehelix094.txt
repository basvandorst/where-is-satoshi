An announcement from !! bCH will be ready in 2 weeks. Note tacked to the top of the prior message which stated BCH would be ready on January 1st. So, basically, this means nothing. Surely Mar. 12 will come and go.

Frustrated is an understatement. Ill remove my comment because it has no factual basis, but this wait is absurd.

Honestly doe dude...reading some of these poor guys' stories here and on the boards makes me wonder how anyone worth an iota of a conscience could sleep at night. My heart aches for you brothas that have more skin in the game than my couple of BCH
