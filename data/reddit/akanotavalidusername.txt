math is hard sometimes. try just more powers of two.  9 more doublings makes mid 6 figure coins.  I think its unlikely bitcoin ever get there however

I believe he's talking about a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, which uses the time derivative/integral and a proportional factor to feedback to a system and stabilize them when they deviate from a set value
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:35:38
soo, just the tip
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:34:05
I believe he's talking about a PID controller but one that only uses the P, which is like when you were in that bouncy house that one time and it sorta had a leak so that when everyone jumped it let out more air and deflated faster and wasn't so bouncy, and so everyone got tired more quickly...  but in the end there was still moon cake and everyone had a good time.

has been doing some analysis regarding this question.  It's not easily answered for lack of precise information about the makeup of the miners and their kWh costs, but its interesting to try to figure out:
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:20:46
interesting. thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:17:43
actually...

coinbase usually takes 4-5 business days to process (this is due to the bank ACH, not bitcoin of course) until you are fully verified.  It should say in the history tab details what day to expect it to arrive in the account

What exactly is your thesis going to be?  This abstract suggests I am about to read a 200 page review paper, and while you have some insights that could be interesting, what is it that you intend to do that will advance the knowledge of your field?

It didn't surprise those of us who were being solicited for 0 down preapproved jumbo loans in '07... i didnt even have a job then!  I declined, and then saw all kinds of immigrants take loans and buy garbage homes next door for 350k or more while i rented.  All of them were forclosed within 12 months and i was not at all shocked

I'm not a beginner but I am wondering if there are twitter bots like reddit bots that can be used to automatically micro-tip unique users who tag/mention a particular product in order to make it trend or go (inorganically?) viral?  I am trying to figure out what the implications would be... would it become yet another way for corporations to dominate the space of information?

Yea this is looking like the only option currently

Personally I also prefer to keep those institutions out of my relationships, but for those to whom its not a bother, why contractualize a relationship into a system which does not confer any of those special properties (tax breaks, medical, inheritance, insurance etc) to the spouse of any kind?  It's kinda the only reason the state has a definition of marriage.  If you want special rights granted by the state, you have to have your contract recognized by the state.  Otherwise this is simply bloating the blockchain

Show me on the blockchain where the bitcoin touched you

(speculation) Exchange rate being kept low so big OTC buyers can get in quietly and cheaply before a price rise and liquidity increase-they can then unload later on retail traders without as much slippage.
