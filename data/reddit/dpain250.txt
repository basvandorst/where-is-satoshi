Fair enough, even considering that you would receive your gift card immediately after the first confirmation (~10 mins)?
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:32:26
Similar, our advantage being that the gift card would be for the exact value where Gyft sells denominations of $5, $10, etc. Would that be enough of a convenience to consider using the service?
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:07:08
We are working on that for revision 2
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:20:38
Bitcoin will stay in your wallet and will only be converted when you want it to be, whether that be all at once for spending throughout the week or several times a day as you pay for things. It's all up to you but you can effectively play the exchange rate if you'd like
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:48:15
how long are you thinking?
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:08:38
Yes, coin is a similar idea except they do not allow for external funding such as BTC/other currencies and we have a few other nice features over them such as a rechargeable battery, form factor that can be used in "Dip" style readers, and the ability to unlock and use the card if your phone dies.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:51:57
Our target is approximately $50 at launch
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:06:46
It is converted at the time of transfer. However, the system we have developed minimizes this time and you can go from BTC-USD in less than 10 minutes so you could effectively make the conversion near the time of transfer.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:52:15
Yep, already worked into the system :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:42:04
In a few months! We are still in development but sign up at  and we will keep you up to date on our progress
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:34:48
The difference is that there is now an easy way for bitcoins to be used in the real world. We're looking forward to the day when BTC wallets are as good as cash everywhere but the truth is that we are at least a few years away from that point. This solution  allows bitcoin more exposure and builds its value by increasing its utility in the mean time
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:22:49
You are pushing from your balance - just as secure as any other BTC transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:52:18
Haha sorry, gotta let you guys know about it somehow!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:20:21
It's the same level of trust you need to place in any young company. We hope to operate as transparently as we can while building the trust of our users and are always open to new ideas. What would make you feel comfortable doing business with us?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:16:13
Hey there, Dave from BitStripe here. The conversion can be made whenever you choose. The entire process is quick so it could realistically be done as you need it but for practicality most people will probably load enough funds for a day or two's use at least.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:54:30
ding ding ding!
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:11:49
We are definitely considering one
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:10:47
Any credit card transaction a merchant completes costs them 1.5% - 3%. This comes out of their side and is the current industry standard with every card transaction. 
As the consumer using a bit stripe card you will only pay between 1%-2%. Hope that clears things up a bit?
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:28:33
Due to some of the anti money laundering regulations that are in place, it is possible that we will need to get some information from you to issue you a card. We  are considering other options that wouldn't require this. We take privacy very, very seriously and are trying to minimize the amount of info required.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:43:34
It's not finalized yet but most likely visa. Is there a reason you would prefer one over the other?
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:42:03
Any time a credit card transaction takes place, the seller is charged 1.5-3%. this is priced into pretty much everything you buy and is how visa, issuing banks and everyone inbetween make their money
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:10:13
Definitely, we will be rolling them out in the US first then elsewhere. Sign up for our mailing list at gobitstripe.com and we'll update you when we are getting ready to ship!
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:52:33
Nope, our system is designed so that it can be used with any merchant, and any POS system. The card is processes just like any other visa or mastercard transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:11:51
Oh we know, we have come up with a few creative solutions that keep the card issuers happy.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:30:03
We're all about the API. Anything specific that you would like to see implemented or available?
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:59:54
You can fund it whenever you like and top up as needed. The only thing to keep in mind is the bitcoin transaction verification time. If you have a few extra minutes for the verification to come through then by all means you can use the exchange rate at the time you make the transaction!
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:06:03
Be careful with them, people have reported getting ripped off.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:51:30
We are going to be working chip and pin into the second revision of the hardware. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:53:14
That's a great idea for a future version thanks! In the mean time we made the decision to seperate ourselves from the user's bitcoin wallet in the beginning as we want to focus on releasing a high quality core product and then add functionality from there.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:51:00
Fair enough, we are trying to keep the fees as low as possible while still being able to support a card issuance program. Ultimately we will be able to do away with fees once we have a large enough user base that the system can be supported in other ways. At that point the card will essentially be free to load and use by the end user
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:37:31
Yes, the merchant transaction is treated just like any other credit card transaction which is why it can be used anywhere - by leveraging the existing infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:05:06
Nope, the only communication with our server is to complete the BTC-fiat transaction. Other than what is required by the card issuers to assign the cards we don't keep track of anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:55:15
We are considering this for the next release. To bring the first version to market as quickly as possible we decided to focus on the core functionality and expand from there.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:31:57
Nope but they're doing some cool stuff too!
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:54:32
The system is setup so that if you dont wan't or have bluetooth for whatever reason (phone is dead for example) then the card can be unlocked and operated completely independently.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:34:41
Exactly, we see this as a great way to help bitcoin make the logical leap into the physical world.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:56:35
Exactly, we are still negotiating with issuers on specific terms but the estimate is somewhere in the 1-2% range when you make the transfer
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:53:28
*1-The card itself is powered by a small microcontroller and has Bluetooth connectivity. It communicates with our app on your smartphone to dynamically update its magstripe to emulate whichever of your cards it needs to. We have security features in place that block attempts to add cards not assigned to you.
*2-Your BTC stay exactly where you have them now, basically when you want to add cash to your card the application gives you an address and once the BTC are received we automatically authorize the funds to be spent on your card. The timeframe for this is dependent on the BTC transaction confirmation time, otherwise it's essentially done in real time. This allows you to time your, say BTC-USD per the market s
Whenever you need cash.
*3-See 1 - magnetic stripes are pretty low security and can be cloned with $10 of equipment if your wallet was ever lost or stolen. Going to a dynamic card actually greatly increases your security by requiring authenticating via either checking to see if your phone is near (and so are you hopefully) or by needing to enter a PIN on the card itself.
*4-About 11 meters per second
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:51:29
The card transaction is processed as a Visa or MasterCard so you will be able to use your BTC at any merchant that current accepts those with our system
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:49:59
Coinkite is dependent on special infrastructure: either a coinkite terminal for the merchant or a coinkite ATM. Our system requires no special infrastructure and allows you to use your BTC at literally any place that accepts credit cards
