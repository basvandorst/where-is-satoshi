I like the *idea* of Bitcoin, but there are so many flaws it's funny.
From the Bitcoin whitepaper:
The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.
Seriously??? Not to worry though, it would be really difficult to amass more computing power than the honest Bitcoin nodes, unless you were a national government, a major corporation, the existing banking industry or you're a hacker with a decent botnet ?

I don't have an answer to how I'd do it differently, I'm not claiming to have an alternative currency (sorry).
@_date: 2011-08-04 08:21:45
When I buy something online, I use a credit card because the credit card company *guarantees* that the item will be delivered as described or I'll get my money back.
If anyone ever manages to steal money from my account, I simply contact the credit card company and they reverse the transaction. It's as safe as anything gets in this world.
For this *fantastic* service they charge the *vendor* 1.5% of the transaction amount. I don't even particularly care what currency I'm purchasing with, the credit card company automatically handles the currency exchange at the market rate.
Now, tell me why I would want to use Bitcoins ?

as i heard it, in the California gold rush, the only people who made money were the people selling spades ?

I have quite a lot of experience with algorithms, distributed and otherwise. I just have a hard time believing that anyone would think this offers a reasonable level of security for a global currency ?

I hate to tell you but this kind of wishful thinking and/or naivety is the reason Bitcoin values have soared (and then crashed).


only right now to draw people into the economy and because transaction fees are being "paid" by mining.


Well yes, until you borrow Bitcoins, then you're hardly likely to have a debt balance to pay interest on.


that's of minimal benefit to me but of *massive* benefit to the early adopters


I'm a law abiding nobody, the government isn't going to freeze my account


This is just funny.


Again, funny. If you think government accountants won't be able to trace Bitcoin transactions once they see the need, you're skating on very thin ice. And when they do trace you they'll make a major example of you. 


Um no, your transaction needs to be written into a block by "the network" run by many 3rd parties


actually for most purposes my credit card transactions are far more anonymous since the only people who can see them are me, my bank and the person I transacted with. With Bitcoin, everyone gets to see all transactions and some people are capable of mining the data to map Bitcoin addresses to individuals.

Well, lets be on the safe side and say it's going to cost $200 million to completely dominate the Bitcoin network (I'm a bit hazy on the technical details).
If any of the major vested interests get even slightly worried that Bitcoin was going to "take their lunch", Bitcoin will be going "bye-bye".
By comparison, lets take that $200 million and imagine trying to use it to destabilise the Dollar or Euro. Um, yeah.

ah, worth knowing, thx.

Like you, as a libertarian I initially thought Bitcoin was a great idea. The more I learn about it, the more I see it's flaws and actually start to wonder if it may have started out as an honourable idea but now has become an epic scam ?
One of the many great things the mainstream banking industry achieved is making it safe to trade with unknown people in distant locations. for example for a percentage of the transaction (10% IIRC) banks will guarantee that your invoice will get paid. in the early days, this ability to deal with people you didn't necessarily trust  was a major enabler of international trade (and probably still is).
There is a reason people are prepared to pay 10% of their revenue for this service !
My feeling is that by the time Bitcoin has fixed all it's *major* issues (which bizarrely are presented as positives) it will look a lot like the banking industry in that it will have centralised wallet services (bank account) and transaction fees of around 1.5%
The big difference of course is that whilst mainstream banks can create (and reverse) a transaction by adding a row to a sql table, Bitcoin needs the complexity and overhead of blocks and hashes.
I would love to see an AMA by a knowledgeable person in the banking industry about what they think of Bitcoin. I can only imagine they are falling about laughing at the idea that Bitcoin is a threat to their business and genuinely incredulous that anyone could take seriously such an inferior solution.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin is a fascinating idea and I wish it could be a success but I don't see that happening. What I do see happening is a whole load of people losing a whole load of money on mining hardware and / or speculating on Bitcoins.
Disclaimer: I don't own any Bitcoins and other than common sense I have no qualification to know what I'm talking about. I've read the Bitcoin whitepaper and it seemed incredibly naieve and full of convenient and wrong assumptions. The whole thing looks like someones college / university project that's got out of hand.

here's a source suggesting that NVIDIA ship 20 *million* cards per quarter. 
now, I know ATI's have better hash rates, so maybe you'd need to buy a few more NVIDIA cards to compensate. I don't imagine it being that hard to get hold of 20,000 (out of 20,000,000 shipped) if you've got $20 million plus to spend. (Not to mention I bet you'd get a great volume discount).

an attack doesn't have to be directly profitable, it would be about the ability to prevent the operation of the Bitcoin economy.
accepted that it *might* be possible to develop some heuristic to prevent "cpu racing", but where is this heuristic?
@_date: 2011-08-05 10:08:58
No, in effect I'm comparing all methods of payment.
I use credit cards for online transactions, direct debits for regular bills, cash for small, "in-person" transactions.
Why would I use Bitcoin for any of these things (even if I could) ?
@_date: 2011-07-06 13:58:00
good point. but the availability of graphics cards is a red herring.
If you have $200 million dollar kind of resources, just get someone to build you a FPGA or ASIC based mining farm.
Better still, since your Rockefeller, or the Federal Reserve, who ever, why not just buy AMD for $5 billion and be done with it ?
@_date: 2011-08-05 10:10:59
Not strictly true. Bitcoin may be a currency but the exchange of Bitcoins is inherently bound up with the currency itself.
@_date: 2011-07-07 21:58:48
from  -&gt; an arbitrary decree or pronouncement
How is the Bitcoin algorithm *not* an arbitrary decree or pronouncement?
In what way are Bitcoins any more "convertible into coin" ?
@_date: 2011-07-06 11:00:38
One important aspect of this "deflationary currency" is that it transfers wealth from people who get into Bitcoin late to those who got into it early. 
Imagine if Bitcoin were extremely successful - ie it largely replaces all the major world currencies and Bitcoin becomes the "global currency". 
Since the supply of Bitcoins is *arbitrarily* limited, the value of Bitcoins will increase phenomenally. The people who computed all the easy to reach Bitcoins when the difficulty was low will essentially be grabbing a *huge* slice of the global wealth store. Makes the US Federal Reserve look like Greenpeace.
1. Create a new "currency" based on *arbitrarily* difficult computation that gets more difficult with time.
2. Calculate yourself a *whole load* of that currency while it's still easy
3. Leave enough easy currency available to get an army of fellow conquistadors to "buy in" and give your scheme credibility
4. Publicise your new currency under the banner of "sticking it to the man" 
5. Profit. Although the word "profit" doesn't do justice to the *terrabucks* you can get for your early Bitcoins if you only grab even a small percentage of global trade.
Maybe I'm just being cynical, but if the early adopters of Bitcoin didn't understand the *massive benefits* to *them* of a deflationary currency, I'll eat my computer !
@_date: 2011-07-07 06:53:06
Could we stop using the term "fiat currency" as if Bitcoin is not also a fiat currency.
@_date: 2011-08-03 09:20:08
it amazes me that you think anyone who has doubts about Bitcoin must be a troll ?
@_date: 2011-08-05 09:59:55
Yes, that sucks but merchants have to accept a certain (small) percentage of people ripping them off as a cost of doing business. Also credit card companies aren't stupid, if a person requests lots of "refunds" the credit card co are going to get suspicious and investigate.
My question is a purely selfish one. Why should *I* use Bitcoin to pay for things online? (And by *I*, I mean any consumer)
@_date: 2011-07-06 12:35:21
so currently, for an approximate hardware cost of 18 million dollars you can de-stabilise the entire Bitcoin network ?
 
@_date: 2011-06-04 05:50:23
seems like a reasonable prediction, but wouldn't the "wallet service providers" want to charge a small commission (eg 1.5%) for handling the transaction?
@_date: 2011-07-06 13:10:09
You're assuming that the number of honest Bitcoins nodes continues to grow, outpacing the ability of "bad people" to build a bigger network.
Given that it's apparently no longer commercially viable to build a profitable mining rig, why would the hash rate of the honest nodes continue to grow ?
@_date: 2011-07-07 07:07:08
The upper limit may be 21 million, but essentially "all" the economically viable Bitcoins have been mined. 
It seems to me that if Satoshi has 1 million BTC he mined about 50% of the "easy" Bitcoins, left another 50% to build an army of freelance PR people and what's left now are the crumbs.


lol. oh yes, Bitcoin is designed to be "phased out" over time, if by "phased out" you mean slowly selling of the EPIC store of value that gets created by 1 milllion Bitcoins rising in value to replace other world currencies. 


I believe in fair reward. Were Bitcoin to be "maximally successful"  Satoshi would be inline to pocket a little less than 1/10th of the total global money supply ... 


The major banking families (Rothschilds / Rockefellers etc) were simply the early adopters of the fractional reserve banking system, which despite it's faults has resulted in the creation of the existing world economy. 
@_date: 2011-07-06 19:28:58
lol, I don't think it's a conspiracy either. it's just a system that vastly benefits the early adopters at the expense of late adopers.
@_date: 2011-06-14 10:13:03
since each bit coin contains a history of all it's transactions, it's a "simple" matter to add all the histories into a database and create a (partial) picture of where the money has been going.
Of course, you could have different bit coin accounts for each transaction, but how many *businesses* would actually do this? Also, given a tracking database, I'd bet it would be possible to to data mine it to link many of the "anonymous" accounts to an individual ?
@_date: 2011-07-06 19:26:21


And am I right in thinking there are about 9 million currently in existence ? So Satoshi deserves about 1/10th of the entire Bitcoin economy that will ever exist ?
Am assuming other early adopters have similarly large stockpiles ?
This is why Bitcoin is exactly like the Federal Reserve. The knowledgeable few own the vast bulk of the money supply to the entire economy 
@_date: 2011-07-06 18:04:48


firstly, gold is inherently valuable and worth having. it is attractive, rare and has many uses other than as a currency.
gold is neither good nor bad, but the very uneven wealth distribution is bad.
Would be curious to know what percentage of Bitcoins were calculated at a given difficult, and who owns what percentage of the easy Bitcoins.
Might it be true that the people getting into mining now are actually investing more in terms of graphics cards / electricity than the founders.
@_date: 2011-07-06 13:38:34
arguably, the supply of Bitcoins has already been exhausted. we're well into the "oil sands" of Bitcoin mining ...
