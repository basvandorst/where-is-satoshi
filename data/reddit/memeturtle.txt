I didn't do it yet, it's my brother who did it this morning I'll ask him when he comes back from work
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:23:06
As I said I've never used it, that's the first time cause I needed to send him money
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:28:39
Nope nvm I sent it to a wrong code, if the code doesn't exist will I automatically get back the money?
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:37:09
Read what I added, I sent it to an address that doesn't even exist maybe I can get it back by contacting the support. At least I have  a change when the address I sent to doesn't even exist, no?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:21:06
I waited for like 13hrs at least
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:04:21
I even logged to his acccount and I didnt find anything
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:34:44
Okay so, new updates:
My friend didn't receive the money cause I sent it to a wrong address which doesn't even exist
My friend's address starts with "329i" and I sent it to one which starts with "329j" and the J one doesn't even exist and I didn't get back my money or anything. Any further help?

@_date: 2017-06-02 02:38:57

@_date: 2017-06-01 22:01:14

My address says "329i" and the guy we sent the money to has "329j" can I even see if it's valid? And if it's not will I automatically get back the money or what?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:32:15
Here's the address I sent to: 329ik6YtrRykhz6DuqkMxt2HoKpJM2dczp
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:47:25
Hm I sent the money this morning with my brother's account, I gotta wait for him to comeback later..
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:03:27
I don't know how this really works I only used btc cause there's no way to send money to Turkey except BTC (paypal is not supported)
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:13:08
Oh really? I thought this is same as PayPal. You gotta wait days that's how btc works or it's only cause it's to Turkey and is it normal that he didn't receive any email or something saying that a payment was sent?
