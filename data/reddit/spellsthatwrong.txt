In what world is an investor happy to see that regular people also are betting on the same thing?
What famous investor ever said “do what everyone else is doing”?

Are we supposed to respond honestly, or do the groupthink thing?
Sorry, I’m new here

Also, if there is a major economic downturn, people will still need fiat. We are so far away from a crash crunch leading to a dumping of fiat. People need to pay their bills.

This is almost identical to the dot com bubble in certain respects.
1) great ideas, low adoption
2) prices based on pure speculation
3) public awareness that it has been going up
4) public unsophistication in terms of being able to properly value it, which leads to
5) retail holders prone to panic selling
6) paving the way for the future, while perhaps not being the future
This bubble will burst, but the tech is here to stay. What that will look like is basically lycos vs google, myspace vs facebook. 
Bubbles make people very rich. I hope this sub can be able to help people time that somewhat, rather than just being a fanboy sub

Right now you can sell it for money. But no, it is not money. Or, at least, mostly not.

Pretty sure it’s a shit ton of speculative retail buyers with no balls. Expect volatility

I heard an old lady on the bus asking a child about how to buy bitcoin. This feels like a poppable bubble

Oh right, governments, rules, and guns

Speculation like this attracts sophisticated players. Something is going on. They dont like everyday folks making money
