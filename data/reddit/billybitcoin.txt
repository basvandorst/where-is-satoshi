Dish has over 14 million subscribers.  If even only 1 percent of their subscribers paid in bitcoin it would be 140,000 people spending bitcoin monthly

How would major unexpected news put downward pressure on price? Its not like people were buying the rumor and selling the news. There was no rumor.

someone set up a crowd funding effort for a Circle SUPERBOWL commercial.  They cost a few million dollars and increase in cost every year because companies report how ridiculously valuable the airtime in front of literally a billion eyes is.  few million dollar investment by the community for a moment then would surely create mass adoption

Dish has a market cap over 27 BILLION DOLLARS.  Overstock.com has a market cap of 368 million.  So what you are telling me is a company 75 times the size of the largest bitcoin accepting company just started accepting bitcoin.....moon.....that is all

Honestly I think the insurance aspect is by far the most important.  If holdings can be insured without having to take coins offline, it will prevent hoarding and improve the bitcoin velocity through transactions.  Confidence in a simple buy and hold system without having to freak out if your account is going to get hacked could get people (such as myself and close friends I've spoken to) to hold 10x as many coins online as before too.

considering bitcoin trading is relatively illiquid at certain times and its early morning for most people who would buy on the news, I would not be surprised if a move on the news occurs over the course of the day.  I just doubled my investment at 561 and am feeling pretty good about the direction.
