A website being written with an ugly editor doesn't have to be ugly itself... Has 0 connection

Some distros have graphical package managers that make it trivial to install software. For example, openSUSE has YaST.

And he didn’t say it isn’t bad. But trusting banks too is also bad and most people don’t seem to care.

What do you mean by this? Armed with guns, or with something else?
In my country, there are no guns, so you can’t get attacked with a gun either. Simple as that. If someone wants to hurt you and has a gun, there’s little point in you having one anyways. 
If people are getting their homes invaded, there are underlying issues much more important to tackle than people not having guns. When people are living comfortably they don’t tend to go around assaulting people. 


Well you could have a tank at home as well, to protect your family. But turns out people having access to more destructive weapons isn’t something that improves your security. Same as everyone having guns doesn’t.

Do you think this is the norm? Do you think there's a real gun blackmarket in most european countries?


Why am I delusional? I'm talking about normal people having guns. Of course, police and military have it. Still, I don't see any shootings in the news. If you think people not having guns, or a country not having shootings is delusional, maybe you should travel abroad.


If I want to kill you with a gun, then I go and shoot you. What are you going to do about it? This isn't some wild west movie where you can pull your gun faster than him and shoot him first lmao. Functional societies don't need people being armed to deter others from attacking them.


Not really, more like a fact of the way you choose to manage your country. The inequality in the US is astonishing. That isn't "a fact of life", it's americans being dumb as fuck and voting for people who defend the interests of the top 0.1%. Look at the tax rates for the rich, it's laughable and sad at the same time. Believe it or not, in some countries people don't go bankrupt because of having to go to the hospital.


It's called reduction to the absurd. Just an easy way to show that your reasoning doesn't make any sense.


If you've had to use weapons to stop crimes many times, I wouldn't like to live where you live. The deterrent works when the policeman has a gun and you don't. Not as much when you have it too and can kill some people before they manage to take you down. Just go read the statistics.  "Although it has half the population of the other 22 nations combined,  the U.S. had 82 percent of all gun deaths, 90 percent of all women  killed with guns, 91 percent of children under 14 and 92 percent of  young people between ages 15 and 24 killed with guns". Nice deterrent there, stopping those children from killing you.


Turns out it's pretty suitable here. There are no shootings, there are no murders with guns. There are less murders in general.  Criminals get caught by the police. I don't have to go around with a gun just in case someone tries to kill me. I can just live my life like a normal human being.
I'd rather have a functioning society than a group of neckbeards walking around with guns because they have to "protect their families".


Of course military and police force are armed. You're just being obvious here. Criminals are not armed with guns here, believe it or not. It's actually crazy that you think a place without armed criminals is some kind of unarchievable utopia. You should travel more often.

I didn’t say a single word about bitcoin. What the hell is this answer? Who are you arguing with?
I’m starting to think you’re trolling.

The hell does Costa Rica have to do in this?
In the US there were 5,3 murders per 100.000 in 2017, in my country there were 0,7. 
In the US there were 4,46 gun related murders per 100.000 inhabitants in 2017. In my country there were 0,15. That’s almost 33 times less. “GuNS mAkE tHe Us vERy sAfe AnD fReE”
Of course, everyone having guns has nothing to do. Because “CriMinAlS haVe ThEm aNyWaYs”.

There are virtually no crimes with guns in my country. Criminals do care if it's legal to have a gun, if they can't get their hands on one otherwise. Which is the case on many functioning societies.
If you think this is disingenuous and not true, that speaks volumes about your lack of perspective on the world.

Yes, there's people living worse. What's your point?
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:50:07
Yes your country might be very wealthy. That doesn’t mean 99% people aren’t living like shit. I guess it doesn’t matter as long as they don’t “take away your guns”
Edit: obviously the 99% isn’t a literal figure... I’m just saying there’s a lot of poverty in the US

Apple drives down the cpu frequency in phones with old batteries because if it didn't they would just shut down with 40% battery or so. I personally find that perfectly reasonable. Get a new battery for 30€ and your iPhone 6 will be back to its maximum speed. And in the next version of iOS there's a setting where you can choose not to throttle your Ghz, obviously exposing yourself to unexpected shutdowns. 
Please don't spread BS.

The problems bugs can cause aren't only "payments failing". Anything can happen, and I doubt it's smart to risk money you depend on when the developers themselves are telling you that you shouldn't.

Well to be fair USD isn't in beta and its price is stable, so I'd say it's much safer for merchants fight now.
