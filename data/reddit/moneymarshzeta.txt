I’ve ran into people like him, my question is why are you still friends people like that are so toxic and end up failures because they can never point out and fix their own shitty personal problems

Personally I prefer Gemini over Coinbase. Essentially the same company but I believe Gemini has better leaders and supporting cast and just overall works better than Coinbase I actually started on Coinbase but switched over due to what I just stated. As for storing your coins honestly all these 20 year olds forget that people don’t want to be responsible for a nano ledger with $10k worth or more of crypto! Can you imagine a 50 year old having to to set up a nano ledger and than copy down his phrase code and all the other steps to really insure safety when you have more than 1 btc putting your nano in your sock drawer and phrase code in your favorite book ain’t gonna cut it we need companies like Coinbase and Gemini (need them to be better to) for storage purposes, checkout Gemini’s whitelisting feature basically disables withdraws from your account so even if a hacker gets in he can’t to move your crypto

Coinbase is whack they have the first mover advantage but are constantly adding features that other companies install first I use both but I do not trust/like Brian and his team from my own research.

They are a US company they would be held responsible to a degree... sec would not let it slide
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:10:11
Literally all these comments are from noobs, try out Gemini they allow you to whitelist your account which in my opinion besides a biometric is the best security and exchange can offer. The next step is to hold it a nano ledger that you would have full responsibility over keeping safe and that requires researching how to properly use one.

Master nodes were just a fad, they are overhyped and will lose you money over time
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:57:35
Dude I was you two years ago, unless your comfortable with loosing money as you learn do not try to day trade because you see everyone trying to do it, you will fail and I’m correct in saying that just as in how you would fail to do anything you knew nothing about. Just buy and hold and man we’re in a bull market the price isn’t going lower than 8k so I would start just buying now.
@_date: 2019-08-18 19:30:27
Honestly you could have just googled this whole question online and it would have saved you so much more time

Coinbase and Coinbase pro are two very different things

Go read a book about it
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:51:56
Wow I hope you aren’t trolling man, but look into a company called Gemini they are a bit better than Coinbase in my opinion but they offer better security For your crypto, so people like you don’t have go through the trouble of trying to story it Safely
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:06:51
Unfortunately yes, but there are some politicians that recognize that the taxe laws on bitcoin are ridiculous and are working on getting them changed
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:56:53
First make sure you coins are still there and than move them to a ledger nano s but fully research the product first it’s the most safest for a individual use but places all responsibility on that individual to keep it safe.

(I may be wrong)I assume your talking about bakkt? The main thing is that the contracts are settled in bitcoin which means users profit in bitcoin instead of cash so deep down anyone using this platform even if they’re shorting bitcoin would want bitcoin to rise in price eventually. Every other futures prior was settled in cash so it didn’t really matter if bitcoin went up or down people would just make money on the percentage swings mostly only intermediate to advanced traders can accomplish that feat I should add. Bakkt is a little bit more special because they have other plans besides just being an exchange

Also I’ve been told robin hood doesn’t let you actually posses the crypto currency and we have a saying around here “ not your keys not your crypto” meaning if you don’t own the private keys you really don’t own the crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:51:57
There’s a lot of factors your not counting in, you honestly sound kind of ignorant about mining and computers so i recommend you do more research it’s been years since it’s been proven it’s not profitable to mine on a computer or labtop. A computer consumes more energy while it’s doing something so I bet you have spent more money on electricity than you have even earned if at all. What your really doing is just wasting your money doing something in a very inefficient way
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:54:43
Nope it is not at all, I recommend Coinbase and Gemini. They are both simple to use but I prefer Gemini because they offer better security options that you will have to learn about. Coinbase only offers sms protections which is still hackable. As far as the fees go, your gonna get charged wherever you go just suck it up and buy already in a year it won’t matter
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:00:33
Your right, last thing to understand bitcoin you have to realize its multidimensional there are many area of learning that must occur first in this space. Don’t give up

I haven’t seen this comment yet but another reason is because most companies that use bitpay the receiving company doesn’t receive the crypto they receive the cash equivalent of the crypto worth at the point of sale and most don’t like that they want companies to fully accept it and use it themselves
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:06:21
Gemini or Coinbase

Don’t get married to a alt coin, these coins will pump than it will dump regardless of how you feel about it
