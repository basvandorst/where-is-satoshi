With a crystal ball like yours, you must be a billionaire! Why are you surfing reddit? Shouldn't you be on a yacht somewhere?

it will spread even fastlier if google and musk get the satellites they want for global internet

Thank you for the response. Doesn't the capacity reflect on the number of nodes available to facilitate transactions though? A decline in capacity would therefore signify a decline in incentive to run a node?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:29:10
I don't personally run a node, but I assume the reason to do so is the financial incentive. I know it's not super profitable at the moment if at all, but I just figured a decline in network capacity signifies the incentive just isn't enough.

This comment nailed it.

This guy has an interesting video on the subject [
To summarize: Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin is being purchased OTC (meaning not on standard markets) and being put into a handful of wallets. Miners are selling OTC to keep prices from falling while these mystery wallets are purchasing supposedly to keep prices from rising. The theory in the video is that financial institutions are buying as much Bitcoin as possible right now under the table before a coming bull market. It's possible they know behind the scenes something like a Bitcoin ETF is imminent.
On the other hand, I think it's also possible that wealthy individuals could be the ones purchasing OTC, not financial institutions. Hundreds of millions is not much to a Saudi prince or Russian oligarch.

Seeing your last two sentences, it looks like you love saying I told you so...
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:13:50
This person clearly created a Reddit account 5 days ago to troll this sub, don't feed it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:20:21
Just stop. No one cares about your arbitrary price predictions.

HODLers haven't lost any money, a digital number went down when looking at their phone. You lose money if you panic sell your BTC.
Edit: to the folks talking about "current value" and saying hodlers have indeed lost money, the US government treats crypto as investment assets and not currency. If I'm wrong, then why do I only pay capital gains once I sell my btc, not based on it's current value at the end of the year? Ok, done with this discussion.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:13:05
Wow, somehow in your long reply you failed to answer any of my questions about why regulations that would protect consumers would be so bad and why exchanges would bend over backwards to avoid them. Instead, you keep steering the conversation in weird directions saying I'm trying to "scare" you? I'd introduce you to a female if I wanted to do that.
My original post was about my hopes that Bitcoin could lead to a distribution of wealth that is better than the current world economy. You don't seem to have any interest in discussing how crypto could reach mainstream and prefer it to stay a niche playground for technophiles and created a Reddit account a week ago to regurgitate crypto-isms. Therefore, this conversation is pointless and I'm done with it. Have a good night.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:19:17
Incorrect. HODLers are using BTC as a store a value, not a medium of exchange. If you purchase that $1k worth of gold, it doesn't matter to you how much it is worth at the moment, you are not going to the super market with it to pay for milk and bread. The only thing that matters is the price point at which you sell it. Same as with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:04:49
When the market is bearish, all the naysayers come out to say I told you so. The exact same thing happened with Tesla in r/investing with their recent struggles, I got ripped apart for defending the company. Now that the stock is doing much better, the haters are all quiet. Maybe not this year or next, but I suspect the same will happen with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:38:01
Not necessarily. I think there are plenty of early adopters who were able to buy a ton of BTC for $0.01-$10 each as a speculative investment. If they wanted to become rich in fiat, they'd have to sell their BTC at some point. Even if they missed selling at ATH, they could sell at current levels for enormous returns.

Ok there R Kelly, maybe dial it back with the blow...
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:00:51
Do you understand what a free market is? Name one that has been successful on a large scale with absolutely zero regulation. When there is enough money involved, there will be people using their wealth to manipulate the market in their favor and if you think otherwise, you are being naive.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:08:35
If you bought in to make a quick buck, I recommend sell and don't look back. Hodling ain't for everyone, no shame in it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:04:13
[sigh] Ok bud, here's how exchanges work on the internet. To be effective, they need a large market of buyers and sellers, aka transactions, aka liquidity. People don't want to wait 3 months to fill a buy or sell order. If big countries block exchanges avoiding regulation, people aren't going to go out of their way to set up a vpn or Tor to access an exchange hosted in Uganda.
Why in the world would an exchange like Binance want to be like The Pirate Bay and face constant shutdowns and domain seizures? It would be way easier and profitable to just comply with regulations. Also, why do you act like regulation is the worst thing imaginable? Ask the people who lost all their coins and money on Mt Gox if they're in favor of regulated exchanges...
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:22:08
Cool story...
Too bad we're not talking about the protocol, we're talking about the exchanges on which crypto is traded which are by nature centralized. These can and should be regulated in order to prevent market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:17:18
The way you lump a whole group of people together and label them all as ignorant is concerning. The fact that you go out of your way onto a Bitcoin sub to do it is even more concerning. I sincerely hope you figure out whatever it is in your life that is making you so bitter.
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:14:52
Do you think 95% of society understands how the internet works? Most people don't even understand simple concepts like the cloud. But that didn't stand in the way of adoption once layers were built on top of the infrastructure that made things convenient. Now people just google things and complain when the wifi is slow.
All people need to understand is that Bitcoin is a secure and efficient way of transferring value globally. Once layers like Lightning are built on top of the settlement layer and the network effect takes place, presto you have a global currency.
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:37:03
Inflation... Yea it's still $10, but what it can purchase is slowly erroded over time, that's an accepted fact of fiat.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:17:51
Why not?
1. Timing the market is a fool's errand
2. You'd be subject to short-term capital gains
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:27:20
Ah yes, but if you believe in the Reynolds power bottom theory, the price will soon thrust upward in a candle of gooey nonsense.
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:29:22
Yes, you're right, but I wouldn't say looking at addresses tells us nothing...
If you look at the list of top 100 addresses on bitinfocharts, the top 5 are exchanges, but outside of that it looks like mostly whales. I would think there are far more instances of single wallets having many addresses than one person having many wallets. This would only make the distribution I mentioned worse.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:28:56

Yup, go away.

If you're talking about smuggling and trading cash, just think about how ridiculous that would be with a fiat inflating at a million percent. Also, people would run the risk of the government confiscating the US dollars. Yes, Bitcoin is the best option.
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:33:44
Lol wtf are you on about. Going with my internet example, there were plenty of "self serving" companies at the forefront. Netscape, CompuServe, Internet Explorer making browsers. Yahoo, AltaVista, and Google with search engines.  I won't be the one to convince you though, you'll see soon enough if you're alive in ten years.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:30:49
If it's easy to google, try that first 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:58:02
Reading comprehension must not be your strong suit... In my first reply, I outlined how layers on top of the current network will make a high volume of small transactions possible. This is not speculation, some of the smartest engineers on the planet are working on it and the Lightning network is already scaling.
Ever travel internationally? It's annoying to have to exchange currencies each place you go. Or having to wire transfer through ACH and wait weeks. Then there are the countries who hyper inflate their currencies, making Bitcoin's drop in value seem like a nice summer breeze. I'm the one laying out valid arguments, you're the one sounding self-righteous, coming to the BITCOIN SUB to put it down as if you're trying to save poor souls from the devil's fruit. Kinda sad.
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:15:02
Dude, your ignorance is laughable. Venezuela's inflation rate is around 1,000,000% and you're talking about a 60% drop?
They're using it as a store of value, not buying groceries with it. They can purchase BTC with any savings they have and convert it back to bolivars when needed.
