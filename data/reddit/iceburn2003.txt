I went ahead and sent some Bitcoin to this address.
You have the Encrypted Private Key and one of the Distributed Password Backup Shares... The coins are yours if you can get in. Best of luck trying to decrypt it. :)
Edit: I went ahead and swept the coins back to another wallet. Don't worry, no one broke in.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:56:29
Just to clarify, 6 characters is the minimum, although still extremely secure.
5-7 words is overkill, but it doesn't hurt to be extra secure, especially when you have the distributed passphrase backups to fall back on.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:35:38
Ah that is a good thought. I will see about removing it.
This does not expose any of the secret data from the site, but I can see how someone may not want Google to even know that they visited a site called encryptedbitcoinwallet.com.

You can have multiple deposits into the same paper wallet address, the risk comes if you ever spend from the paper wallet.
In order to spend from the paper wallet you would have had to expose the private key to a computer somewhere. That computer could be compromised.
In order to be completely secure no address should be used after the private key has been exposed.
I will note there are advanced techniques that could be used to prevent the private key from being exposed to the network by signing a transaction offline.
Re-using addresses (even for deposits) also makes you a bit less anonymous since multiple transactions are linked to an arbitrary address. It would be more anonymous to have independent addresses for each transaction.
Edit: TIL there is a difference between the Public Key and Public Address. Even if you spend using a offline signed transaction your Public Key would be exposed which presents at least a bit of additional risk.

Their website does not seem to mention the technology that Espinha describes, so maybe they did discontinue it.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:30:03
Thanks BashCo. This is the best solution for now.

Edit: TIL there is a difference between the Public Key and Public Address. I will have to find out more about the risk of exposing the Public Key though a spend.

You can try it yourself here: 
Note: Internet Explorer users, be prepared to wait over a minute to generate your wallet.
After making a few wallets manually in an image editor I decided to customize bitaddress.org to make encrypted wallets to my specifications including support for distributed password backups.
Distributed passphrase backups are a key feature of the site. The shares of the passphrase backup can be distributed to several people or places without exposing the passphrase itself. If the passphrase is forgotten or the passphrase holder is gone, the passphrase can be recovered by combining the requisite number of shares.
Let me know what you think!
You can download a copy for use offline for even greater security. Here is the zip archive with everything you need:

Mind you I said that I recommend 5 to 7 **words**, not characters. That is a relatively long passphrase.
I consider 6 **characters** the bare minimum, but even then it should be extremely difficult to crack due to BIP38 being intentionally slow and resource intensive.

Thank you. It looks like this is normal. The 'blob:\\' url is local data.
A blob: URL does not refer to data the exists on the server, it refers to data that your browser currently has in memory, for the current page. It will not be available on other pages, it will not be available in other browsers, and it will not be available from other computers.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:16:39
I added browser detection to the site and put an alert for Safari 6 users. Could you test it for me? I would definitely appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:03:40
Ok thanks for your feedback. I will see what I can do to get it working on Android in the future. It would be nice to be able to demo from a phone.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:05:59
Your designs look great! Are you releasing these under a standard license? Do you mind if I incorporate the designs into my open source paper wallet generator?
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:40:55
This is correct. The ZIP archive contains everything you need to run the website offline. You can encrypt, decrypt, and recover passwords.
Keep in mind encryptedbitcoinwallet.com uses standard encryption protocols. Even if encryptedbitcoinwallet.com is gone in 10 years, the underlying technologies of BIP38 Wallet Encryption and Shamir's Secret Sharing will still be available.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:35:16
It sounds like you may be expecting the behavior of a Brain Wallet.
With a Brain Wallet it generates the exact same private key each time you enter the same password. If you entered 'mypassword' one one Brain Wallet site then 'mypassword' on another Brain Wallet site you would expect the keys to match.
With a BIP38 Encrypted wallet it generates a new, completely random private key for each wallet then encrypts it. Entering 'mypassword' in one wallet generator will result in a different private key than when you generate a second wallet or entering 'mypassword' in another wallet generator.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:06:00
It would be better if he had explained that he could not process the wallet rather than just not responding, but I can understand why he would not take on a small wallet like that. A wallet is extremely extremely difficult to crack even if you have many clues of what the password might contain.  His $20 cut of your $100 wallet would not even approach the expense involved in cracking the wallet.

Thanks. I will have to add a 'remove share' button in a later release.
Trust is difficult, but I have published the website under my real name. I have created the site as a fork of bitaddress.org to make it easier for folks to analyze my code.
To be extra safe you can always download a copy of Encrypted Bitcoin Wallet and run it from an offline computer.
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:55:57
Unfortunately you would need to use some other sort of converter to create a private key out of your dice rolls. Once you have the private key you can enter it on the site to generate the printed wallet.

Try  for generating BIP38 encrypted paper wallets. It has a built in feature to print distirbuted passphrase backups using Shamir's Secret Sharing. The project is a fork of bitaddress.org that includes several new print styles and some additional features.
One of they key features is a distributed passphrase backup using Shamir's Secret Sharing. The shares of the passphrase backup can be printed and distributed to several people or places without exposing the passphrase itself. If the passphrase is forgotten or the passphrase holder is gone, the passphrase can be recovered by combining the requisite number of shares.
Here are a few example wallets:

One thing that bothers me about this security measure is that the fake webpage can simply pull the personal image and/or personal message from the real website by passing the information that you have already provided it.
1. You provide the fake website your username.
2. The fake website uses your username to retrieve your personal image off the real website.
3. The fake website displays your personal image to just like you would expect on the normal website.
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:53:31
Yes unfortunately that is the case. My site is based on bitaddress.org which is also affected by this issue.
Did you plan to print your wallets directly from your Android device? If not, then the site is of limited use from your device anyway. You cannot easily save a generated wallet without printing it.
I will keep this issue in mind for future releases, but due to the limited usefulness of running the site on Android, a fix may not be implemented unless it is released by the bitaddress.org project.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:09:24
Thanks. When you are ready to get the Bitcoin off the paper you can use the 'Decrypt Encrypted Wallet' feature on the site to create an unencrypted wallet that contains your private key. You can also use any BIP38 compatible tool (bitaddress.org, etc.) to retrieve the private key.
The next step is to use the private key to import or sweep all the funds to another address. Here is some more information:

Thanks for the feedback. It is not currently under version control and I do not have an easy solution to audit it against the original sources, but these are good thoughts. I will see what can be done.
For now the only thing I can offer is an HTTPS download via my personal website: 
I was unable to get a free SSL certificate for encryptedbitcoinwallet.com, but I may purchase a certificate in the future.
Edit: I added the project to Github -

 does not load, but  works. Not an ideal configuration for a website in 2014.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:16:52
That is a good idea. I will add a wallet label in a future release.
I am concerned about this 'unique value back to the server'. Where did you find this? Does it appear in your address bar? Are you sure it only appears after generating a wallet? What browser are you using?
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:38:44
BIP38 is designed to prevent brute force attacks. Each attempt to decrypt the key takes a considerable amount of time.
I implemented a minimum of 6 characters for the passphrase on encryptedbitcoinwallet.com. I consider that sufficient for a BIP38 passphrase.
I would recommend a 5-7 word passphrase.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:47:26
The problem with test runs is that you have (almost certainly) exposed your private key to the internet. Once my private key has been exposed to the internet I consider it compromised.
Of course you can do a test run by generating a wallet, going through the full motions of using it, then when you are comfortable with the process you can create another wallet for long term storage. Just make sure your private key is never exposed to the internet.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:31:25
This is correct. Do not use the site with Safari version 6. I will see about disabling the site for Safari 6 users for now.

This has been suggested before and is not a bad idea.
The zip file is currently offered as an https download from encryptedbitcoinwallet.com, so the validity of the site's certificate ensures that you are downloading the file I published to my server. 
A signed zip file would only be a benefit if a third party monitors and publishes those hashes for later reference. If the site was compromised or the operator chose to publish a malicious version of the site, the hash published to the download page could be updated to match the malicious version.
The signed zip file would be more important if the download was available from other servers.
Thanks for the suggestion and I will continue to consider it for future versions.

Try  for generating BIP38 encrypted paper wallets. The project is open source and available on github as a fork of bitaddress.org that includes over 40 print styles and some additional features.
One unique feature is the ability to print distributed passphrase backups using Shamir's Secret Sharing. Using the passphrase backups can help ensure that a forgotten password does not result in losing access to your encrypted wallet.
EDIT: I forgot a pretty important note!  does not (yet) have the design from the original post!
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:59:57
Yeah I was mistaken. I didn't realize there was a Public Key as well as a Public Address, you caught me before my edit.
If it was possible to brute force a Public Address we would definitely be in trouble, but if and when that time comes we should be able to adapt the protocol.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:28:59
This is a good thought, but I do not have plans for a secure printing feature at this time.
I would argue that most printers do not store copies of what you print, and those that do would be reasonably difficult to access without physical access to the printer and possibly its internal components.
It is still important to consider this issue. Printing to a 'dumb' printer from an offline computer is probably your safest option for now.
