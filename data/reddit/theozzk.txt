BTC is not working as described on the White Paper.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:30:10
I have read the white paper many times. Bitcoin indeed worked are per its definition up until the fall of 2017. 
Then the speculative component began and the principles didn't apply anymore.

For folks that are willing to question mob mentality, and are truly connected to their portfolio and the sustainability of the BTC market, reading past calls for caution (generally heavily downvoted) is a good exercise. 
This was 3 weeks ago:


When you have brick and mortar "exchanges" through out Asia and Africa selling people crypto on the spot and renting out their "mining" equipment by the hour you know this is unsustainable. 
Keep in mind that these so called "exchanges" are manned by 75 year old ladies with sharpie written signs that say "Buy Bitcoin here!"
It is reality; and it's ugly.
Keep an open mind and always be critical.

Yesterday was Tether, today will be "the full day after the Tether news" and so on...
When Bitcoin reached critical momentum during the first week of December, experts stepped aside and many sold their positions.

Exactly. When you see products allegedly all "different" from each other but with the same audience and these products behave the same, it should be an indication to serious investors that this is a speculative market.

The point he's making is not about the fee. He is OK with the transaction taking 24 hours but more than 2 days is not acceptable to him and he is questioning if that is how a currency transaction should be.
Given the following quote from the White Paper, many of us believe that he has a point.
"The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party."
Bitcoin has become the very problem its definition wanted to solve.

You're reading the environment correctly. Nothing to do with China or S. Korea.
The real problem (the one some very eager "hodlers" are missing) is that this is not a currency anymore. It's a speculation token.
When you have brick and mortar "exchanges" through out Asia and Africa selling people crypto on the spot and renting out their "mining" equipment by the hour you know this is unsustainable. 
Keep in mind that these so called "exchanges" are manned by 75 year old ladies with sharpie written signs that say "Buy Bitcoin here!"

@_date: 2018-01-26 22:46:47
More like some big players taking advantage of your next door “hodlers”. 
Small hodlers (cubicle dreamers) build it up during the day and whales dump it at the end of the day. 
Rinse and repeat. It’s not a currency yet and at this point, it’s unlikely it’ll become one.

I truly hope it goes up to give an opportunity to those who can't afford the loss to get out and learn the lesson. Sadly, we all know that won't be the case.
The most vulnerable gamblers (not investors) are precisely those who won't learn the lesson and will hodl until the bitter, $3700 end.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:36:36

I saw so many of my friends and family lose it all during the housing bubble that I’ve made one of my hobbies to at least warn people when I see something that doesn’t make sense.
And that bubble was even tastier because some people were able to actually see their money grow. Derivatives were juicy and evil.
If I can make someone at least pause before they sink their hard earned money into something that has not been completely flushed out yet, I did good. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:49:45
I understand that there is tremendous animosity towards regulation in the BitCoin crowd but if you think about the ease of realizing your profits with ease, I would look into Ripple. 
Yes, banks are involved but that's exactly why I'm interested. The potential for cross pollination of different portfolios and being able to convert a volatile commodity directly into a more stable holding is very enticing to me.

BTC *is* depressed and deflated. It *did* happen, BTC hit $20K at the end of *last* year.
Most people are now aware of BTC and FOMO would be much less this time around. Specially when most people are aware of the 70% YTD price decline. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:05
It's straight up speculation what's driving BTC prices. If you can't see that, that's a problem.
When you have Nigeria and Venezuela opening up "mining" operations for something they can't even define or understand, that's speculation.

It doesn’t make sense. People transfer money from their bank accounts to other people or accounts for much less. Bitcoin was supposed to end the third party fees with seamless, instantaneous, peer-to-peer transactions. It’s not worked so far.
Heck, I can send an email transfer to anyone for free. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:42:37
Past behavior doesn't predict future outcomes. You might be the one left holding the empty bag. I really hope all the best for HODLers but I'm here for the money. The only money BTC has given investors back in the last few months has been through shorting.

What would be the reason for a bull run?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:11
You make a profit, pull out your initial exposure and keep playing. 
Ideally, your original exposure is not life altering if your ROI doesn't pan out in the timeframe you've set for yourself.
Completely up to the investor, go 50/50 and withdraw or 100 return and take their position back to diversify and let profits do the heavy lifting.
That's how serious people do it. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:07:05

Probably related to the SEC announcement. There are many potential scenarios. 
One could be, "great! no regulation from the system! wee!!!!" temporary pump but then here it comes the realization that institutional money was watching closely and now they'll stay away.

@_date: 2018-03-12 13:05:43
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:16:48
Perhaps. TBH I don't know many traders who would trade based only on one or two indicators. Everyone is different. I use statistical analysis, charts and volume, and known previous patterns of in-kind commodities. Then I validate with others. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:07:59
I don't trade cryptos exclusively and my exposure in the crypto market is limited. However, there is an inverted head and shoulders that might play out and bring us back to $9.8-10k but these patterns have been negated in the past so I would combine that with the lower volumes at $8.3 and pretend that is a quasi-resistance point. These are the times for daily traders. All this is just my opinion of course and BTC has proven to be everything but what the rest of the markets are.
Keep in mind that the case for a sub $4k is there too. No easy answers I'm afraid. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:14:06

A couple of things. I never said anything about never seeing $10K again; you did. You can save the name calling for your friends.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:00:01
It depends on your perspective. If you're a bitcoin believer, then yes. For a hypothetical $100K value, anything between $5K and $10K is noise.
If you're a more skeptic investor, there's a case for $3500-$5K bitcoin in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:09:57
A bit of a gamble but inverted head and shoulders might be at play. $9.8K-$10K possible within the next few hours, hopefully. The alternative is not good at all... 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:45:42
Be a whale. I say it everyday. Stop the "buy the dip" mentality and look at volume/price objectively. Not the time to buy yet; but keep your eyes open.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:07:56
A whole matric ton of "dip".
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:34:02
It would seem so. I don't think it would go past $10.2 but this is pure speculation. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:12:32
If you actually think this is good news you need to do some real reading. Not just reddit reading.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:07:22
There is a case for $3k... It has happened to BTC before and could happen again. There's no certainty about anything but it may happen. Just be aware.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:57:07

Because those are pretty much the boundaries of volume support.

I do.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:43:58
Perhaps... but at $10.6K volumes in the $500k range is asking for trouble IMO.

If you would've told people here a week ago that bitcoin was going to be $8.8K next week they'd downvote you and ridicule you to oblivion. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:27:40
It sounds counterintuitive but if NAFTA gets signed, investors may come back to more *speculative* markets such as cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:24:14
That's fair. But think of repetition. Can you imagine if we could get out emotions out and play this bear market and make $100 in 12 hours everyday? 
$2000 of supplementing income a month until you see a clear sign of capitulation and get in. That doesn't sound too bad.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:54:30
IMO there was a clear pump earlier today, currently being maintained by smaller buyers. Volume has decreased dramatically in the last few hours. 
If I was a whale, I would realize some quick easy earnings without much drama.

I'm sorry, Joney. I didn't mean to be rude but it is the cold hard truth.
The legal minutia of the S. Korean court system is a micro cosmos that is unlikely to have any consequential impact on markets. 
At this point most investors agree BTC is not performing as a currency but a commodity. And a weird one at that.
Sadly, my comment is a reflection of the general sentiment.
 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:31:23
Apparently we were in the ballpark. Hopefully people made a little profit. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:06:36
That's how you make money. Good for you! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:19:10
Absolutely. Always a possibility. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:07:08
Because the BTC "market" IS speculation. I'm just tired of seeing people get swept away by snake oil salesmen.
Hopefully people realize that screaming "HODL!!!!" while they waste away their savings is not the way to financial independence. Observation and calculated risks are.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:59:42

This man speaks the truth.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:26:17
Why do you think that? The only evident, true resistance point looks like under $6k but really, who knows. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:10:41
Really? why?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:54:14
Staying away until capitulation.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:51:00
More like "Billions"
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:09:04
Sub 200 SMA at the moment. Not good news.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:25:27
That's exactly right. TBH the only true resistance point seems to be at around $5.3K but who knows, really.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:44:30
More like 6K is the new 8K. No body knows where it'll bottom but volumes don't lie. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:47:39
"Hey hey heeeeeeeyyyyyy!!!!!!"
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:56:50
It was a beautiful dream because now we’re headed to under $8k...
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:26:20
On point.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:47:38
You know we're starting the capitulation phase when BTC crashing is "Hillary's fault" XD lol
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:28:45
In my opinion, it's doubtful that random, anonymous comments on reddit have any impact at all on the markets. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:34:57
The case for $3k is there. It was either inverted head and shoulders up to $10-10.5 or sideways roll down to $8.4... and from there, shit gets real around $3k.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:19:13
I would wait for a full 24h session above the 200 SMA but it's a sign.

A painful awakening awaits you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:22:43
It is.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:17:51
Comparisons to previous crashes are abundant these days. The volume lost this time around is orders of magnitude larger. There's no comparison in my view.

They've always been here and will stay until there's no more money to be made off people's emotional "investing".
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:39:29

That's how the sausage is made. On point. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:46:43
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:04:45
There's another selling opportunity coming. IMO this $7250-$7500 band is a great jumping off point to lock today's gains from $5.9.
Sell on the way up (don't time the pick) and buy when the volume tells you to.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:58:21
For those who bought at $17k these past few weeks should've been a great opportunity.
Let's say a small investor bought $500 worth at $17k. If they bought another $500 at $6.5k they're looking at an average of $11.75K.
They could still be in the game.
If I was in that position, I would wait for the next up swing, sell my position @ $11.75+ and wait for the next correction to get in again. Another correction has not been negated yet BTW.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:29:29

Always trust your instincts but you're not alone. The amount of pressure that the mob mentality here on Reddit put on investors was brutal.
Very few had the clarity and curiosity to look into critical comments. 
Some of us have called for caution for months now.

"Hey hey heeeeyyyy!!!!"
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:59:10
You see it as them “slowing up the climb”. For some of us looking in from the outside (emotionally speaking) that’s actually just slowing down the decline.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:55:53
On point 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:07:31
I thought it was a currency...
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:01:22
I don't know what percentage of miners are corps. I do know however, that the countries I've mentioned are aggressively promoting tech companies and linking that support to sustainability initiatives. There's too much to this topic for this comment section. Some investors see models like HIVE very interesting moving forward. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:44:02
uh... never mind.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:51:23
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:55:36
It doesn’t matter what it “is”. If it’s perceived as such, that’s it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:30:11
XD lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:03:48
No need for name calling. You see, like I said, your propositions are not sound. They are “valid” but not sound.
Then, no consequent scenario is sound.

@_date: 2018-02-22 14:39:20
I don't get any satisfaction off people losing their hard earned money. There's actually good money to be made in this market riding on whales backs. FUD is not a bad thing. FUD is where opportunity lives.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:02:08
So much genius stability. XD
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:35:10
I understand your view but I don't agree. I don't think BTC is "it". For now I see it as an opportunity for day traders and people who want to sharpen their skills as traders with a "commodity" that moves very fast. I said "commodity" because in my view BTC does not behave like a currency. But really, it's all speculation on my part.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:55:18
Don’t we all love Mac and cheese? Mmm...
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:56:52

Fear, uncertainty and doubt.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:24:55
I don't think so. We haven't seen capitulation volume yet.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:43:50
I would take a hard look at those assumptions.  


That ^ has no viability. 


That^ is not wishful thinking; that's dogma.
Man, I mean this in the most sincere way, please re-think those assumptions or at least don't bank on them. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:17:00
The fundamentals are there. All of them.
It's an emerging market but by next year it might be too late to realize life-changing gains. The time is now.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:24:09
Who knows, but nice little session for day traders, which is ironic given that BTC is supposed to be a currency.
I still think this is a sideways market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:24:22
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:48:38
This might be the best advice of the month.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:10:29
When did you sell and when did you buy? This is a great experience that maybe others can learn from. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:46:02
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:45:51
Exactly, and the system's weapon of choice? Huge, red dildos...
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:48:52
No. But I wouldn't have offered any projections either. In fact, what I did say 7 years ago was that any real applications for BTC where at least a decade away. I believe this still "hodls" true.
At this moment (at least) BTC is a virtual commodity. I think we can all agree that it's not a currency at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:30:44
On point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:26
It would take gains of roughly 300% to make up for the value lost since the ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:50:03
Consequents (sic) of what?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:02:38
It seems like you're missing his point. A good trader doesn't "buy the dip". A good trader waits for the signs and a steep decline is not a good one. A good trader waits for the market to start the bull run to take positions. And most importantly, a good trader doesn't ride a bull run through its entirety; he gets out when the point of resistance is on sight or his target has been reached. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:24:58
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:55:00
I guess it needs to be clarified. Big boys don't only make their money at $19K.
Big boys make money multiple times at your expense. They sold back on Dec 18. Now they're waiting for a volumetric floor, no one knows where it is exactly price wise but a range between $3K and $4K doesn't seem too crazy.
Then they will buy again at $3k and sell it at $5.5K when your next door HODLer is screaming "Lambo!!!" like an idiot.
It will crash again, so massively, that even HODLers will demand gvmt regulation. And the big boys will come again to the rescue and run it.
Vote me down if you want, but this scenario has played out over and over and over...
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:14:54
If anything, it seems like a sign that capitulation is starting. Bottom is not on the radar yet. Not even close.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:39
Sell again and wait for capitulation. Then you're into some money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:41:54
That's a fair comment. However, my impression is that mining has become too expensive for "independent" miners.
The future of mining is huge operations where corporations can make a good business case for "green" investment to offset energy consumption and perhaps qualify for sustainability government grants. We're talking Scandinavian countries, Canada, Japan, etc.
The fact that "mining machines for rent" have been reported in southeast Asia and Africa should be an indicator that independent mining is not sustainable.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:42:55
What do you mean? How do you do a chart analysis without zooming in and out plus reading volume charts?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:07:14
Salty... got burned by the dump? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:04:18
Right, because the wishes of one individual will make BTC go down magically. XD Price is set by whales movements/wishes.

@_date: 2018-02-06 16:04:16
Volumes say it's not over. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:58:23
There are no technical (trading) reasons to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:50:41

@_date: 2018-03-20 19:58:24
Not yet. It would seem as though whales are preparing a big dump.

Correlation does not imply causation. Interesting nevertheless. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:44:16
Just because he expresses a bearish view it doesn't mean it's not constructive. You know what's really unconstructive? Silly people screaming "Lambos NOW!!!". His observation is factual and accurate. Cheers.

In the financial world, yes. Very.

I just don't see the fundamentals for "hodling".

Not asleep but away from cryptos. I didn't trust the move up and I sold when it hit $8.5k. I might jump back in at some point but not now.

Have you ever tried to make 10 libertarians agree on something? OK, now try organizing thousands... I wouldn't hodl my breath.

It ain't. Not yet.

Hopefully most were able to make a nice little profit this weekend. Be a whale; now wait out the storm.

No one knows. There's a strong case for under $6k levels.

There seems to be no serious bulls at these levels. Around $6K seems to be where the action is.
