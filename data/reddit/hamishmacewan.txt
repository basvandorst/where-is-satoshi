The full public key (and private key signature) must be presented for redemption.
Correction: As the earlier poster correctly noted, any public key that hashes to the address (and its corresponding private key) will suffice.  It does not require a unique key pair.  It is called P2PKH, pay to public key hash for a reason.  The assignment of control of the bitcoin is made to a non-unique hash, the payer cannot set conditions more rigorous than that.
Mea culpa.  Quite disappointing to add this misconception, after so long a period, to the list I held about Bitcoin.

Which, as it is related to difficulty, really means only the target difficulty is used to calculate total work.
Which is unfortunate because although it might have led to more orphaning of the current terminal block, would have meant the fanatical pursuit of "first post" would not have arisen and miners would have had to consider that as an innate part of the deal.
Thanks for the assistance in understanding this matter.

But wouldn't that mean the terminal block could be displaced by a later block with higher difficulty, and yet it seems "first come, first served" as long as the difficulty is met.
[I held the same opinion as you expressed, "work" was the decider, but from other statements and conversations I'd been convinced it was merely order of arrival as long as the difficulty was minimally met.]

A good argument that such an index would have so many variables of indeterminate value and be subject to such debate that any number that came out might as well be 42.
If, as is often argued, decentralisation is a core value of Bitcoin, the market's assessment, by way of price, should be a sufficiently accurate indicator.

You would have increased the risk by 2^96, yes.
In decimal, a smaller example.  If you said only one digit was required in a two digit private key, would it be easier to guess 0x than xx?  Yes 10 times easier.
And once you have guessed the private key, OP_HASH160 on the public key isn't going to change the fact your Bitcoin is gone.
Save the venom, you haven't really misled anyone, as the numbers are vast even with 96 of the 256 set to zero.  It's not a risk anyone is seriously going to take by tossing a coin 160 times.

"Direct Payment Communication"
"The Bitcoin mesh network currently serves two purposes: communicating payments from sender to recipient and communicating payments from originator to miners. By communicating payments directly from sender to recipient, the mesh network can be used exclusively for communicating payments from originator to miners. The network is then free to propagate or ignore transactions without adversely affecting the communications between sender and recipient. This allows for the emergence of a true market in transaction fees. And by reducing the load on the mesh network to just those transactions which are profitable for miners, it improves Bitcoin’s scalability."
What does that mean?   For a peer to peer network, there seem to be a lot of non-peer parts in play.

Interesting perspective.  However with the costs of entry being so low, how you gonna stop new altcoins?  It's a matter of the market selecting, and that's mostly going to be on the community the coin attracts.  Bitcoin has such an incumbent lead in all areas, it seems unlikely to me there will be more than a few altcoins in distant second place.

The spender provided public key is hashed to check against the public key hash in the output, and so any private key that corresponds to a public key that hashes to the RIPEMD160 works.
But that isn't sufficient
It needs to satisfy 
So unless the actual correct unique private key signature matches the public key, no spend.
This would also avoid public key hash collisions permitting spending outputs intended for other, colliding, key pairs.

How can anyone claim any conscience when their modus operandi appears to lurk until a down moment arises during which their gall and spite can be spat out on the premature corpse of an idea they didn't have.
And FFS, its not a Nobel Prize, it's the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.  Alfred would roll in his grave if he knew the shamanism that is economics was awarding itself prizes in his name.
"The Economics Prize has nestled itself in and is awarded as if it were a Nobel Prize. But it’s a PR coup by economists to improve their reputation,” Nobel’s great great nephew Peter Nobel  told AFP in 2005, adding that “It’s most often awarded to stock market speculators .... There is nothing to indicate that [Alfred Nobel] would have wanted such a prize.”
Members of the Nobel family are among the harshest, most persistent critics of the economics prize, and members of the family have repeatedly called for the prize to be abolished or renamed. In 2001, on the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prizes, four family members published a letter in the Swedish paper  Svenska Dagbladet, arguing that the economics prize degrades and cheapens the real Nobel Prizes. They aren’t the only ones."

If swift operating cost and narrow margin pricing comes to the market as you describe, average users are participating at near par.

I'm steppng past the limit of my competence here so I might still be missing something.
Any keypair can be used to make a digital signature, but unless each private key  produces a unique signature, what is the point?  And since the private key is not revealed and (cleverly for space and privacy reasons) not even the public key is revealed until the outputs are spent, the spender must know it and it must generate a unique signature.
If the public key confirms the signature was produced by the uniquely matched private key, then the hash collisions are resolved, and are not alone sufficient to spend the output.
There is a signature malleability though, "In addition for every ECDSA signature (r,s), the signature (r, -s (mod N)) is a valid signature of the same message," but that doesn't appear to reduce the need to know the private key to spend outputs.

Higher efficiency has no effect unless all other miners can be denied it.  If they are not profitable (and this article is illustrating how broad the definition of "profitable" is, when costs are low and public/private good is involved) they will stop mining.
Bitcoin was mined for nothing more than amateur pleasure in the past, as Wikipedia is edited today.  That time may come again, or the incentive will be less toward cheap energy and pointless "efficiency," instead more toward co-mining opportunities like home and commercial heating.

Once there's a rush for the exit prompted by low fee TX's the price can runaway.  
It's cheap for the attacker since their transactions are priced low and so don't get confirmed, or bounced on congestion or timed out.
The defence, which I believe was removed, is  prioritisation.
However I suspect the attackers discovered that the high transaction fees applied in the public mind to all Bitcoins.  So if the attacker had intended to blacken Bitcoin Core, they discovered they'd shot themselves in the foot, and remarkably, stopped doing it.

The hash is only of the block header.  All the transactions are represented there by the Merkle tree root.  And the extra nonce in the coinbase transaction has it's effect via changes it makes to the Merkle tree.

The interview is littered with errors and attempts to colour the perception of Bitcoin.  The comparison with play money like Linden dollars, I mean, if he wanted to make that kind of slur, why not call it Monopoly money.  His grip on exchanges vs mining was loose.
All in all, very much like this cartoon conversation: 
@_date: 2013-07-14 19:18:16
I understood that changes to the extra nonce in the coinbase transaction were propagated into the header by recalculating the Merkle tree root.  If that is so then then the individual miner would need to have the complete block available.  Or does the client receive only the coinbase transaction and the hashes of the other transactions in the block.
This is done, AFAIK, to reduce the load on the miner supervising server, particularly with the high performance ASIC mining that is now prevalent.
