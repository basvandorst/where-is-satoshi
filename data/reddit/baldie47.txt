how can you claim forks?
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:29:36
I have a ledger nano and I looked and apparently the compatible wallet is EXODUS. I was checking about how to login with that one. but I don't really know. I think I have to import the private key to the exodus but I'm not being able to get it to work for now

For storing bitcoin is perfect. But now I bought the nano S as I also have some Ethereum. Also super satisfied with it

I use mycelium, but I would like to know if there are better recommendations here.

Why you say that?

Use a "pandora tomorrow" dead man switch

he probably uses a stencil though :P

I am aware. But I wasn't sure if the coins from the fork were dependant of the exchange or not . 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:08:42
Yes. Sorry  I meant exchange. And thank you. This replies my question . I didn't do anything with the previous fork. I have all my coins in the hardware wallet and I haven't touched them.  (Ledger nano)

And he charges to teach people. Around 17 usd. For a month of help with any questions and help with setup. Good luck OP. I hope you get people to use it.

Pretty much what you need. They're quite big. Last time I remember you could sell 600k pln in one operation
@_date: 2019-12-29 17:05:29
you can both in these
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:30:43
Sorry. I expressed myself wrongly. Last time I checked it had to pay at the moment in one transaction 400k pln. So you can sell that on btc
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:02:38
literary after pressing "post" the transaction arrived, I'm super happy but that was a tough half an hour

I love these projects, is there any subreddit where I can learn about these? like with raspberry or stuff?
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:02:27
One question. I have my coins in a ledger nano  (Not the "s") do you know if they're safe there? With this fork and stuff I mean . ..
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:18:34
thank you, I know about the coins not being there, but I wasn't sure if this changes that are coming might affect the way one can access the coins (something like the key access not being compatible or similar.)
thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:41:37
I have them in a ledger nano. (Not the S)   should I do something with it?
