Are you being sarcastic? It is 'your' money. Money is simply a representation of the value created by an individual. Society benefits from the value you create, your reward is money.

How is it more socialistic because of her ideas when she spent her entire life fighting against socialism? If anything it is more socialistic, despite her ideas, not because of them.  
"She does not understand that the weak will be always stronger in direct hit attacks, because they are simply scared and they join forces." 
She was well aware of this tendency. In fact, that was the central theme of Atlas Shrugged. The 'weak' continually encroach upon the freedoms of the competent until the competent go on strike and disappear, leaving the rest of society to deal with the consequences of the world they built and the 'morality' they always said they wanted. Hence the title Atlas Shrugged.

Taxes diminish production by diverting capital from where it is most productive to where it is least productive. This is and economic truth. Hoarding has nothing to do with anything.

Taxes discourage production, reducing taxes incentives production. The public is on the whole, better off with less taxes. The book covers a number of economic fallacies, but chapter four and five deal specifically with taxes.

What are you talking about? The poorest countries in the world with the lowest standard of living tend to be the ones that are centrally planned and re distributive. Nigeria is in the shitter for a variety of reasons, but it isn't because of a lack of taxation. Literally Google the tax rate of Nigeria. Meanwhile, Lichtenstein is prosperous with only a 1% individual income tax.

It was an ad hominem. Yeah, Rand was hard-headed and an abrasive person to be around, she didn't single handedly wipe out socialism, and Greenspan is swine, but none of those things are valid critiques of her ideas. 
I find the idea that another person must/should sacrifice their own well being because of my own incompetence repulsive and demeaning. If you actually read Rand and you're still sold on the idea of altruism, there's not much I can do to sway you apart from telling you Atlas and Anthem are more convincing than The Fountainhead, if you care to read them.

It’s in there, both links I provided address that. The rich don’t hoard money under a mattress, they put it into savings accounts, stocks,  bonds etc. all of which spurs and bankrolls new industry. You cannot have a prosperous nation by continually diverting capital from the most efficient, productive sectors to the least productive ones. 
But get this: even is they were to literally bury their money in the ground, it doesn’t change the fact that they produced that value. Assuming they don’t have outstanding debts and they justly acquired that wealth, they have a right to do whatever they want with their own property. Necessity does not give you  a valid moral claim on someone else’s property.

What !? Reagan wasn't and economist and his economic policies were a mixed bag. Nothing that I've been saying comes from "Reaganomics". In fact, Hazlitt was an Austrian economist and the Mises Institute (the url where that book is hosted), is devoted to Austrian economics. Mises and Hayek (who won the nobel prize) are the most famous of these.

The concept of property existed before the modern nation state. Just because governments exist (in theory) to protect property rights, doesn't give them the right to take it from you involuntarily. You have your cause-effect relationships backwards. 
Winning wars is not an accomplishment of government when they're started by governments in the first place. You also make the mistake of assuming private funding wouldn't cover beneficial goods and services in absence of a coercive regime. 
If something is important, people will fund it voluntarily. If people aren't willing to fund it voluntarily, then it isn't important enough, or it isn't important to enough people.

"Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?
 "When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor – your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money.”

First of all, those millionaires have a right to 100% of their billions so long as they were justly obtained. You do not have a moral claim to the wealth of another.  Second, all the services you mentioned would exist without taxation. The mere fact that privately funded cancer research exists alongside billions of dollars of government funded programs proves this. Would the total contribution to such research be equal, greater, or less than the total amount that occurs today? No one really knows, but the free market allocates funds towards the services people desire more effectively and morally than any centrally planned system based on mass coercion , where funds are allocated based on political privilege.

Individuals produce goods and services. Value is ultimately a measure of the relative utility of those goods and services. Money is simply a standardized representation of value that facilitates exchange. No government decree necessary. Your conclusion that without government we'd be trading "rocks for bails of hay" is baseless, unless  of course, you mean gold.

Rights don't come from government, government's purpose is to protect rights. Otherwise, nothing government does can actually violate your rights, so long as it's written into law.

It's sad really. The entire point of Bitcoin is to establish an ecosystem free from a regulatory authority and centralization. The problem is that when enough people start making bad decisions, they want to get together and employ the force of government to make them whole. Never mind the fact that you have no one to blame for your bad decisions but yourself. Yeah, Roger and Coinbase are pretty scummy. Guess what? You can do something about it.

My love for the price memes doesn’t detract from it’s libertarian appeal to me. One day we will measure value in bitcoins. Until then, USD is the most convenient way of communicating value. 
You’re right though, mass adoption is bringing in a lot of people who couldn’t care less about ideology. Hopefully, a good chunk will realize the ideological implications along the way, but whether people realize it or not, bitcoin will bring us all greater freedom as it gains popularity.
