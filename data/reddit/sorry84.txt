No, the implications are not widely understood. 
Fiat currencies never last more than 40 years because they are inherently corrupt. Even the USD has gone through at least three major incarnations. The gold standard, Bretton Woods Agreement, and currently an unbacked system. 
Fiat is considered worthless by many because: 
1. Fiat always loses purchasing power (i.e. WORTH LESS than it previously was)
2. Banks and government have complete discretion to control or confiscate fiat currency
3. Fiat is used as a means to punish, control, and censor individuals
4. Fiat funds wars, democide and other state sanctioned violence (i.e. the leading cause of non-natural deaths worldwide)
5. Fiat is the primary currency of crime, such as terrorism, major drug deals, bribery ... etc

Best case scenario: It’s more than likely they’re not into Bitcoin. Meaning they won’t have a clue what to do with it. Even if they do, most newlyweds would probably prefer cash or a practical gift they can actually use. 
Worst case scenario: The Bitcoin price goes up to a stupid number in the next few years. Word gets around you’re into Bitcoin. People speculate that you’re sitting on a fortune. The wrong people (criminals) get to know. You’re now the target for a violent home invasion.
