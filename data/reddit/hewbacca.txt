What do you recommend we look at instead?
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:09:46
Yup same.  I will keep an eye on it for sure.

Great idea; they need to add merchants that people actually shop at though.

Lol.  Amazing username.

Yes I did; that is the list I saw.  Two or three of those are brands I use, and I would purchase from Amazon or another online retailer.  I've never bought something directly from Sennheiser, for example, the prices are about 50% on Amazon.
I think most of those companies do most of their business in brick &amp; mortar stores (I've never ordered online from a Macy's, Banana Republic, etc).  Maybe it is just me.
Might be very situationally useful but I think they need to add a lot more brands before it'll be worth thinking about.

It's somewhat ridiculous that you don't support debit cards for that use.  Keeping in mind that when I say debit cards, I mean a Mastercard or Visa issued by a bank that draws directly on a checking account (your site calls that a debit card, but it isn't).
It seems irresponsible to let people buy bitcoins on credit, and strange that you wouldn't allow them to do it with money they already own.  Especially when linking a checking account does the same thing.

If you want a save haven for your money, and don't like your country's currency, I would suggest buying dollars, euros, etc.  Alternatively you could buy low-risk securities like short term bond funds enumerated in those currencies.

Yes.  That's what I meant by the "advanced" mode, where you control the keys.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:27:47
Bookmarked.  Can find this elsewhere but not as quickly or easily.
I somewhat disagree with the conclusion tho; some of the "crap coins" are eating BTC's lunch right now.

How?  All of the complaints with Coinbase are complaints with fiat and banking.  Unfortunately to get fiat into Bitcoin, one needs to deal with fiat.
This morning three of my friends took an interest in Bitcoin, and after I sent them their first 0.001 they all opened Coinbase accounts.  How else does one get Bitcoins?
The "average" user is not a paranoid anarcho-capitalist.  They are just slightly to very geeky people who want to see what its all about.  They aren't going to meet some dude at Wal-Mart to get some magic Internet money, nor should they need to.  That is not useful to what Bitcoin can be.
I'm not sure how we do "better" at converting fiat to Bitcoin than a site that converts fiat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:48:05
Correct.  So in a "real" wallet, the keys are stored in your wallet file, or some give you an HD phrase as well that you can recover from.  No one else has the keys/phrase because they were generated on your machine for your eyes only.  Those are your bitcoins, essentially.  The Coinbase vault claims to be that, but since they are giving you the HD phrase, you don't really know.

Good article with some good economic background.  However, the author calls into question his authority to be speaking on the topic with words like "unsignificant" and the phrase "full retard."
Either you're writing an academic-level paper (blog?) or you're another guy on the Internet.  Make up your mind.
Anyway, worth the read if taken with a grain of salt (like everything).

Good article

Yes but individual fees don't have to go up if adoption increases and there are many more transactions with the same low fees.  That is what we are seeing now, more transactions, but because the block is limited, fees would have to go up.  If block size was increased, you could see low fees AND more money go to miners in the form of more transactions per block.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:00:10
Could be, but I've seen no issues with anything else.  Will keep an eye on it at least.

Anything on Amazon?

So what happens when you are getting recurring payments from something like a mining pool?  Or you post a BTC address in the documentation of your software for donations.  These both use the same address forever.  You're saying that only works "by accident?"
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:23:47
Gemini appears to be more focused on trading.  They have the ability to put in limit orders and such.  Coinbase seems to be more focused on long-term buying and holding/using.

Maybe there will be.  It's not lunch time yet.

I suppose that makes some sense, I just look at a service like PayPal, and I have a bank account linked (slow), and the "debit" card associated with that account linked (fast), and it serves as two forms of payment, and I can get instant transfers.

Every certain number of blocks, the BTC reward for mining a new block is cut in half.  It started at 50 BTC, is now 25 BTC, and approximately June/July of next year will halve to 12.5 BTC.  This will continue until ~2150 when all 21 million Bitcoins will have been mined and there will be no more block reward (miners will be compensated entirely by transaction fees).
The thought is that this will increase the price of bitcoin, as the supply being created will slow down.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:26:14
I believe it is uBTC which is equal to .00000100 BTC (put in 8 decimal places so you can see that 1 mBTC is 100 satoshi).
One satoshi is .00000001 BTC, not .00001 BTC.

Yeah I was thinking that.  I've never in my life paid to have a bank account.  Sure there are costs that are hidden or picked up by others, and there are fees for ATMs, bill pay, overdraft, etc, but if you want a free bank account it can be completely free.

 I did say "I also am not a big fan of online wallets".  I do not use Coinbase as a wallet or store coins there.
That said, are you saying that Coinbase doesn't want you to use them as a wallet?  I find that inconsistent with their marketing.  For example, no fee on transfers between Coinbase users' wallets.  Or their Vault, which is designed for long-term storage.
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:42:00
Hey did anyone catch the part where mining doesn't really "validate transactions?"  Mining creates new blocks which include transactions, Bitcoin nodes validate transactions by confirming that they are X blocks old and that the chain hasn't forked.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:52:23
No, it's not (super helpful).  I really appreciate the insight though.
The hardware is a month-old Macbook Pro.  The wallet file is stored on the built-in SSD.  At the time of the error, I was connected to wired Ethernet, power, and in dock (not that movement would affect an SSD).   I was playing a game causing the fan to be on, so there was some heat maybe, but this all feels like a stretch in terms of being the cause.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:46:00
I also am not a big fan of online wallets, but that aside, I would use Coinbase if I was going to go that route.  They seem large and legit enough that they are probably the most trustworthy.

I think the answer to your question is that full nodes should be run on servers with server resources.  Hard drive space, memory, and network access.  I believe for the casual user, running a full node is not a good idea.

Bitcoin fees are substantially lower than Paypal.  The fee on a Bitcoin transaction is an absolute based on the data size of the transaction in bytes, not as a percentage of the amount being transferred.  Therefore, for microtransactions Bitcoin may seem to have high fees, but once you start transferring amounts in the multiple dollar range, it is generally cheaper than Paypal.
That said, if you are pirating video game keys, you should continue using Paypal until you eventually go away.  Bitcoin doesn't need you.  If not then I apologize, but that is sort of what your post sounds like.
@_date: 2015-10-30 00:40:34
For all the reasons that Bitcoin is cool other than as a speculative instrument, which appears to be what you're using it for.
Spend and replenish.  Maintain your hoard.

Coinbase has two wallets, the regular wallet, and their vault.  The vault, in "advanced" mode or whatever, claims that they give you the HD key and then they don't retain it.  If that is true, Coinbase is as secure as your own wallet.  If you lose your HD key, you can't ever get the coins back.
The problem is, you have no way of knowing for sure if they throw away the HD phrase or retain it.  If they retain it, they own the coins along with you.
If your coins are in the "regular" wallet, they are Coinbase's coins, and you are trusting them to give them to you if/when you want them.  Not saying its a good or bad idea, just understand what it is.

Profitability is linked to BTC value.  What do you think Bitcoins will be worth when you want to sell them?
If you want to convert to dollars as you mine, find a mining calculator and plug in your specifics to see if you are making money.  I like this one:

Depends on your definition of adoption.  I don't think price affects real adoption, meaning people using BTC as currency and not as an investment.  Stability helps adoption though, and I think price and stability will be well-correlated going forward, though I do not believe there is a causation between them.
