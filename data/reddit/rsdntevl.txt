why would you recommend gyft, it's a scam
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:34:38
Gemini is trash, 1% fees is straight up theft.
@_date: 2018-08-23 12:37:23
Google 
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:34:58
Lol so they been etfing for 5 years

Enter tether 
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:51:12
Didn’t even know these existed 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:05:08
How is USDT a good indicator of side money if it can only go up and not down 
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:05:24
You’re saying they can’t buy BTC with the tether they print?
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:27:25
It’s spelled “bought”
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:53:45
It was a joke
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:03:02
I support Bitcoin and all, but bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes while visa clears in a couple seconds. How is bitcoin “fast” and visa “slow”?
Edit. I see, if your talking for a vendor’s perspective of getting the funds then yeah bitcoin is faster.

Ever heard of a real estate bubble
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:30:19
Not viable if you do short term trading, otherwise holding is okay.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:28:19
What do you mean Bittrex involvement? Like they scammed you?
@_date: 2019-04-01 02:19:32
That’s how jokes work
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:20:48
Who even thought local bitcoins was ever a good idea
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:24:20
Even billionaire are subject to FOMO

How is it not sustainable? When prices drop the difficulty adjusts and less hash rate is needed to mine.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:53:20
Did you not read the thread at all
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:07:04
Repost how many times..

How do you plan for energy at night?
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:55:45
Wouldn’t you make less with the 10% discount? I can’t imagine paying cash would incur more than 10% more in fees.
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:35:46
How did Tesla mess up the solar industry?
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:37:01
You’ll still have excess leftover energy depending on your mining capacity

Only if you have the property paid off, which was the point I was trying to make.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:47:21
That’s assuming you paid off the property 
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:43:49
Where do you plan to live if the only property you own is leased out?
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:51:56
SF is not somewhere people stay long term, makes little sense to purchase a home there.
It’s really situational, there’s no general rule for buying or leasing.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:58:39
Honestly the best way is to find a remote job and work in a place where costs are cheap.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:10:41
That’s great you’re helping with adoption, nicely done 
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:12:40
Ughh did someone say EOS?
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:00:07
Why not receive 100% in fiat payment then just buy on exchange to hold. You’ll end up with 11.1% more crypto than if you received just 90%.
@_date: 2018-07-20 04:35:07
Right but you can’t live off the rental income, which is what OP was referring to when he said he doesn’t need a second job.

A private blockchain is not a new internet. It’s just an alternative form of persistence storage, that is designed to keep un-alterable historic data.
Think a chain of traditional database, where each block is the new database state.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:29:48
Private blockchain with private nodes where private institutions can maintain validity among themselves.
Database can be changed 
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:03:59
You could have a private blockchain, it won't be decentralized though.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:36:31
Yes you should
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:19:46
Been hearing this for years

There’s enough dumb people in the world to sustain his debacle
