Well, a stolen wallet would compromise adresses generated after the fact as well. Could easily be fixed with a new seed every time you click the backup button or something though. I think the benefits far outweigh the problems and I hope it'll be implemented.
@_date: 2012-01-17 22:56:45
I think that's the most likely answer since there hasn't been much upward movement lately. Weird thing to do before the results of the Good Wife episode is apparant though.

Downvoted because of the completely nondescriptive title with mostly caps and the shortlink which could as well be a virus...

Since many bitcoin users are male you would probably gain from selling things like fleshlights and such as well.

I wouldn't remove the hologram (if it hasn't already been removed), keep it as a pretty coin instead, they seem to be selling for 2-2.5 BTC on bitmit.

I don't think gold or any resource other than solutions to hard mathematical problems will stay scarce forever, primarily since all gold on earth come from asteroids and asteroid mining is starting to become a real thing.

It did say For official use only iirc.

A thin default client would make this problem a bit less severe, then the average bitcoin user woudn't have to think about this.

It's mentioned in the article that their computers are tailored for specific types of alghoritms. I don't think elliptic curve cryptography is among them since it's not among the most common ones. Further, ECC is much stronger than many other alghoritms - the standard used by Bitcoin is secp256k1 and appears to have a strength of 2^128. For comparision, the NSA intends to increase their computing power by 2^3 by 2015. I can't foresee the future, but my guess is that secp256k1 wont be surmountable for hundreds, thousands or millions of years, if ever.
My math might be wrong, but you get the gist.

Both Slush and Gavin (and one more?) lost funds from two different VPSes, it must've been an error on Linodes part.
@_date: 2012-04-05 16:30:36
Yeah, I don't blame you. I thought it was real as well until BLEAOURGH reminded me that this same person were behind Bitcoin Magazine.

This has already been discussed a couple times, it's because of satoshidice, a casino/gambling website.
[edit] Here's excluding popular addresses: 
@_date: 2012-03-19 23:57:52
Totally didn't expect that. Of course "Fix Win32 RPC Crashes" was the first commit I looked on when I read about the vulnerability, but I definitely didn't expect that code to be the potentially exploitable bug...
The only thing they could've done better regarding delayed disclosured would be a less eye-catching commit message. Regardless, good job.
@_date: 2012-03-02 15:15:17
So Linode apparantly had a customer support account compromised; am I correct to assume that the these support accounts can't access the VPS but only change the manager administrator password et cetera, which requires a restart of the system? So an encrypted installation on Linode would have been safe against the attacks? Or can Linode log onto the system using the password?
@_date: 2012-05-10 22:43:21
Could users mining in the main pools and users listed as unknown on bitcoincharts together do a 51% attack, or does pooling somehow prevent you from doing malicious things? And a follow up thought, could changes be made on the pool administrators side to prevent their users from being malicious, and thus letting Bitcoin users worry only (or mostly) about the solo miners? At least it would be much more difficult to do a silent attack.
@_date: 2012-01-12 14:07:00
It can basically do things like 2 keys needed to allow spending so that two individuals can have one key each and both have to agree to spend them. It can also do contracts, shares in companies and a lot more.
@_date: 2012-02-11 21:18:18
It takes a few days to change from BTC to USD, so you should have dollars ready and exchange in good time before they run out, so that you have some usd to use when needed.
@_date: 2012-05-20 23:22:06
They're trying to distribute tainted coins, same reason they sent some to the bitcoin faucet. They probably think it will be easier to launder them if they aren't the only ones having the coins from the hack.

How long will this be allowed to go on though? I think chinese users realize that the government wont like this and are hoarding, except in a good way.

Someone should totally start a clone of that site and call it the bitcoinchallenge, I think the crowd would come up with some great ideas.

He stopped making an earlier edition of the coin, I presume it's those that sell for 2BTC.

Why not?
@_date: 2012-02-22 20:55:30
Maybe arrange with theymos to have a sidebar ticker ad thingie with auctions in it in exchange for a donation to the proposed reddit  advertising campaign.
@_date: 2012-02-26 18:02:06
Yeah it does contain every transaction that has ever occured. But in the future clients will probably hold only the headers of the transactions (i.e. a minimal database); or nothing at all and recieve only the data needed on a case basis. Further most transactions will probably occur internally; i.e. mtgox starts issuing debit cards and in-store-payment; and all transactions will only occur internally in MtGox's databases except when you withdraw or deposit. 
@_date: 2012-06-06 09:46:43
I'm on, but we should create a  channel on freenode or something, would make collaborations like this easier.

People are so fucking gullible (me included, I apparantly fell for his bitcoin magazine scam). That Facebook page has existed since the day before yesterday and there is no verification whatsoever. Matthew is obviously a scammer. Could someone report his post?

I can't find that faulty fee announcement mail in my inbox, was this really sent to all? Either way, we can probably expect tons of scam mails shortly.

I can't really see the cause for this liquidity though, The Bitcoin usage haven't grown *that* much nor can I see how speculation could have worsen the liquidity so much. Anyone has a plausible explanation?

I posted that yesterday: 
@_date: 2012-04-06 11:23:51
I'd guess it's in a raid configuration, so they rather have something like 70ish TB, and they store multiple lines of logs on every single trade which amounts to several terabytes and want it to be futureproof and able to store logs for a foreseeable future.
@_date: 2012-01-22 04:43:40
Of course. When is a different question though.
@_date: 2012-02-22 20:57:15
A working and populated auction/classifieds site is essential for the Bitcoin economy; but I am as well a (tiny) bit annoyed. Maybe Theymos and bitmit could arrange sidebar advertising.

I recommend using Dropbox together with Truecrypt for regularly backing up your wallet.

You generate an address and discard it if it doesn't start with dice, and do that a lot of times.

On bitcoincharts the markets are ranked by total month volume so the spike probably wont make it show up in the charts.
I don't really know much of chinese internet culture and what not, but could the popularity of Bitcoin in China perhaps be a result of a combination of semi-widespread use of Tor, pornography being illegal and relatively low economic freedom?
@_date: 2012-01-09 12:47:12
This could very well be the "killer app" of bitcoin.

No offence, but this is a shitty idea and I hope it's never implemented - it would severely degrade the quality of this community. I'd not be able to take this subreddit seriously anymore.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:32:26
So what I'm mostly worried about is; does the MtGox software have the ability to do rollbacks, and did these 500k BTCs leave MtGox?
@_date: 2011-08-15 19:38:51
Interesting how some people don't get it's a joke.
@_date: 2011-06-23 00:01:13
What does this have to do with Bitcoin? Are you saying that if you encrypt your wallet hackers will rob you physically instead?
@_date: 2011-12-19 23:17:20
Haha I bought 50 BTC just before this started :D
@_date: 2011-06-27 15:43:33
Besides, all of those are probably possible to create using bitcoin scripting, so it'd be likelier that a mod to bitcoin was created rather than a completely new currency.
@_date: 2011-08-13 15:59:36
Yes but KFC want to sell you their chicken to make a profit. Since I make profit buying from them, and they make profit from being bought from we both made profit. Thus the needed pennies has been generated out of thin air and we're both happy.
@_date: 2011-12-19 14:29:25
The point of the currency is not mining and speculation is only harmful for it's stability. I'd prefer you stay away if you're only in it for speculation and mining.

Don't forget to keep a printed record of your wallets md5 hash. That way you can always detect bit rot and corrupt files. Remember to update your hard copies as they get destroyed by age and don't forget the password...

When is the pool used? When you create new addresses and when you do a transaction?
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:20:48
Hmm I realize now that he probably hardcoded the first block in the client; a chain must start somewhere. But could someone embed a string in a bitcoin using the scripting system, and could you find it by looking in the blk0001.dat-file?

I don't quite get his point because I'm personally not looking to make a profit in every transaction and I doubt others do either. I want to trade my currency for goods that I personally value higher (goods that I want). In reality I make small losses all the time, such as exchange fees etc. Could someone elaborate what he means practically? People are not trying to create a profit when buying from KFC.

As far as I know everyone has the ability to hand-create specialized bitcoins using the scripting engine which can include strings. I have no idea how it works though.
I don't see how Satoshi could do something that no one else could do.

What the default bitcoin client really need is instant on. I never realized how flawed the client is until yesterday when I tried to send a couple bitcoins to my little sister.

It appears people are nervous about the big rise which is why it stalled momentarily at ~4.1, but in the long term it will go up because of the buy/sell ratio.

Exactly. If it actually leaked from the auditor he probably sold it or did the attack himself.
