Hey Guys, I work at Revel. I'm new to Reddit, but thought I would chime in here. 
One of the main reasons we wanted to talk about Bitcoin was that our end users have been using it without our push.  We created an open platform that can accept any kind of payment, and some of our clients ended up using bitcoin.  We thought that was rather cool.  Its one thing when a brand says we accept this, versus us building a open platform POS and finding out the creative things your users are doing with it. 
We are really interested in how payments are changing. The market is becoming fragmented and evolving, but we don't feel its our role to pick the champions of this race, but to allow our merchants to choose the ones that their customers are using.  Whether Coin ( which is really just credit ), Bitcoin, Paypal, cash, or whatever is next, we want to give our customers the tools to grow their business. 
Thanks for the mention.  If you know of any retail or food services restaurants that want a better register, let us know. 
Best,

I know I came across Bitcoin black friday - 
Not sure how many retailers participated there, but I think it was a noble effort. 
I think what is interesting here is there is a gap between using digital currencies in online settings versus brick and mortar.  Many of the online players are trying to bring digital payments to physical settings - with mixed results. It will definitely happen in certain groups, but maybe not in certain clusters.  I think retail establishments with higher price points with tech savvy user bases ( cars / luxury items ) with go first.
