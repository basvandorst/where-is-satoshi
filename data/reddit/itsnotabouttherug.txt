ha! true. i've heard that CB is almost completely overwhelmed. 
yes, shapeshift's response was not even comparable to one week so i'm thankful / lucky!

first- the issues was kindly resolved by Megan (see above)
second, i hear you. how were your issues resolved?
this was my first experience with customer support and i was worried about price volatility.

does the last chart imply BTC at 3000USD by 2020? 
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:14:52
price is going up but historical volatility is going down. 
bubble? I don't know, but the number of buyers and sellers is growing steadily. the trend is strong.

wasn't a straight shot to reddit... regardless, reddit is a resource listed on the website so it seemed like a logical place to go. 
is your username ironic? :) what is the purpose of your comment?

shapeshift resolved the issue so i am not a disgruntled customer. not here to criticize them. (THANKS Shapeshift.io / Megan!)
i'm not in the business so i'm only guessing here -&gt; i doubt that an exchanger in this industry (ie exchanging volatile assests) would survive let alone do well with a business model that had customer support times of 48 hours. exchangers are probably shooting for a response within an hour or two. if it were up to them i'm sure they would answer immediatley but as a new exchanger experiencing explosive growth it is probably difficult to balance the number one priority (security) with number two (customer service). it's a balancing act that will hit equilibrium eventually. but no way does that equilibrium have a 48 hour wait time for customer support, not in this industry anyway.

companies like  are betting on it too.
