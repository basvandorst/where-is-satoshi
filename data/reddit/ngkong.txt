It means if I have latest version of openssl, i do not need to upgrade bitcoind
Am I correct?

The article is new but the info is a bit outdated.
Bitcoin.co.id is now in open beta stage and registered member just passed 3000 only 30 days after it launched
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:23:22
if i've upgraded openssl, do i still need to immediately upgrade this released?
Ubuntu has not release the latest version and I avoid compiling.

I think it's true. If attacker got your password &amp; 2FA private key (from memory leak), then your account is doomed.

for now, are there any good reasons to use server side Bitcore to replace bitcoind?
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:12:21
use bitcoind
1. listunspent
2. split them to 500 input each
3. createrawtransaction
4. walletpassphrase
5. signrawtransaction
6. sendrawtransaction
7. WIN!
i have a php script to do this, but got no time to install new bitcoin daemon

If you don't mind to answer, what OS your team are using which store the ssh private key?

this attack is disaster for exchanges. exchanges send hundreds of txs each hour, they can't wait for 1 confirmation for each tx.
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:15:14
some companies need to send hundreds or thousands of txs per hour. it means they are forced to use previous "change output" with 0 conf as the input of the next transaction

sure it is not a coincidence! they try to make some money short term since long term is no longer promising in china.

The point is the monopoly of hashing power is not healthy. Even 20% is already not healthy and contradict with decentralication system which bitcoin is trying to build. What if ghash.io is controlled by russian gov or any goverment? Or the people behind ghash.io is a real asshole or a psychopath, or threatened by someone? It's not likely but there are little chance. If they intend to do attack, it might be only temporary for few minutes, but the impact will be massive.

We don't store people money/bitcoin. Our website is used for submitting exchange request only. All transactions are made manually.
And converting to https protocol will effect our search engine ranking. That's why we decided to not implement it yet. But since it became a concern https will be installed today or tomorrow.

"a hint - it involves another major bitcoin app. ;) sshhhh.."
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:55:29
most of the hashing power is coming from cex.io, which they have 100% control.

Beside trading fee btcchina also charge 1% for withdrawing Renminbi.

maybe they are going to support dogecoin

To reply your statement we are not some random dude, we are a legal company registered in Indonesia.
The spread is fair since it is very difficult to deposit/withdraw money from most of international exchanges exist today. Deposit to/withdraw from mtgox takes about 7 work days. We are trying to help Indonesians who are interested in buying/selling bitcoin. Of course we are not perfect but we are trying as hard as possible to promote bitcoin in Indonesia.
As stated above by other commentator, real time exchange/trading service is impossible right now with such low of bitcoin supply in Indonesia.
And we process transactions almost instantly in working hours. The min. 1 hour gap is for precaution if we are overloaded, since all bitcoin transactions is done manually.

you sure need to worry about this:  
the entire bitcoin system is threatened

Bitcoin could be Twitter for the Key.

If you want to sell 1000 BTC then you are not our target audience (yet) :) I'm sure mtgox, coinbase or bitstamp is better suit for your need for now.
