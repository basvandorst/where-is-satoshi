My parents call it bitcoin, but they say it in a derisive tone.

Some bears lately have been saying that a lot of people are investing in bitcoin on credit, tether is causing unbacked price inflation, volatility may be increasing, etc.
All this has me wondering if bitcoin's prospective hegemony of the world financial system could be threatened not by a direct attack in the form of hacking, but by market control by the big banks and establishment forces which have a vested interest in destroying a free, decentralized form of money.
I don't know much about how finance works, but is this plausible? All this talk about institutional investment has be worried that manipulation could happen while bitcoin still has a relatively small market cap.
This article in particular:
The guy seems like he has an axe to grind and is openly hostile toward cryptos, but he still brings up some good points it seems.
What effect will opening the floodgates to Wall Street money have on the price? Could it become like gold and silver which are artificially held down?
From article:
bitcoin, by setting itself up as a sort of decentralized bank, was also creating an unreasonable expectation to its new "depositors" that they will always be able to redeem their assets at par, given a wild mismatch between its $200 billion "market cap" and new investor money – which is clearly well shy of that number.
This expectation is dangerous as it means, in the event of a liquidity crunch, people will behave not as people necessarily behave when there’s a sharp sell-off in a stock, but more along the lines of when their bank’s solvency is being called into question. Remember bank runs?
As bitcoin qua decentralized bank is running a fractional reserve with a chronic shortage of dollars, a shock therefore has the potential to not just drive the price of bitcoin down a little bit, but also lead to a major liquidity crunch and abject panic.

"eyes at the top of the pyramid", "orbits of global commerce", "large pools of capital", "respectively" "existential threat"
Admit it OP, you're a 16 year old who just discovered weed.

I agree. Due to network effects I think there will eventually be only 1-2 cryptoCURRENCIES, and right now bitcoin needs to race toward being 'transactionally useful' or risk being overtaken by superior alternatives. Bitcoin has a huge head start due to the already existing network effects, but that lead is being eroded.

I'd slow your roll on the whole "my parents are idiots" thing. It kind of makes you seem immature.

Let's also listen to Linkin Park and slit our wrists.
