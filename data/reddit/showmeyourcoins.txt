Problem is btc is moving in new directions. Faster than before. 1 year 2 years ago is now only 6 mo this.

btc only goes the opposite of what you're doing. whatever you choose, you're still screwed.

this is not 1 guy collecting this money. it's given back to creditors.

missing the point here guys, anyone can invest by using crypto style payment system is the cool idea behind this. A farmer in China can buy a piece of that hotel. This is the beginning of something special.

Beware boys, BTC likes to listen to what we say and do the opposite.

some of these comments are ridiculous. Maybe I would understand the doubt in 2013. It’s over guys, it’s adopted and continues to grow. It’s way past it failing. Other coins may be better, faster bla bla. Btc is king. Love it or hate it, it will bash you.

I wouldn’t complain about more money coming in. We shouldn’t care about how many diff ways bitcoin is spread across the financial marketplace. All we care is that it’s happening.
