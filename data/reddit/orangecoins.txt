Pro tip: take the amount you put in + the taxes you’ll have to pay, otherwise you’re not recovering your initial investment : )

The amount of nonsense you put on a single sentence is mind boggling. Nobody cares how much you paid for your bitcoin, if it drops 50%, you lost 50% of your money.
Also: don’t use candy bars to talk about basic math, that’s offensive to candy makers all over the world.

Move your coins from Coinbase to GDAX (free, instant) and from there to your wallet of choice (free for you since GDAX pays the fees, pretty quick)
