The fed doesn't print money. The treasury does. The fed has some control on the multiplier, but today the multiplier I'd under 1.

I don't believe you.

The fact that it's at $100k and you think it's a store of value like money is the problem.
If it ever stabilizes, then there is a reason to mock the doubters. Why would any normal person use bitcoin for a business transaction, when the value changes so drastically? 
The fact that it keeps deflating (each unit being worth more over time) doesn't work against the haters, it works for them. It's an investment in something that has no intrinsic value and is clearly extremely unstable. 
Bitcoin needs stability, not higher values.

A currency that is not worth spending isn't a currency.

It is because 90% of people have very very little education on the subject.
Probably 99% of people don't understand money at all.

it is one of like 500 crypto currencies.
The fact that it is so unstable makes it unlikely that it will be used as currency.

M0 is hard currency. There is no equivalent in bitcoin.
The crypto equivalent is basically M2. M2 hasn't moved much at all.
The reason M0 moved is because the multiplier  (ie the effect of fractional reserve banking) dropped below 1. The options were what is advocated here (no new money supply - historically a fucking disaster) and having the supply of money diminish by about 2/3rds, and cause a run away depression where no one will spend money...
BTW, do you really think that crypto works without loans?

This is not why at all.

Who is using it as currency? Seriously. 
What dumbfuck is trading it for a pizza when tomorrow it can buy 10 pizzas?

FWIW, this matches the data I provided previously. Pretty good video explaining the graphs in more detail.

What? LMFAO. Why can't this sub police itself better?
It's like they gathered up all the illiterate people on reddit and dumped them here and The_Donald.

In a thread that is completely ignorant of money, you think you understand a new currency?

m is short for mil. mil is 1000. 
mm is 1000 1000 and equals 1000000, also known as million.
