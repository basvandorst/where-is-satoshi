I think as far as users believing they will get rich off of BTC may be true for people just getting into it, but the general subscribers to want BTC to be treated as it's own currency which is what it was intended for and not something to be traded for fiat if the value rises.

This isn't something that has been studied or peer reviewed as far as I know, but simply based on how people upvote and downvote particular posts.  For example, one of the most upvoted posts from [today]( is about disproving the myth that BTC is a pyramid scheme promoting it's use as an alternative currency.
There are also frequent [posts]( on from people asking how to turn a profit from investing small amounts of money towards mining hardware, but with the hardware available now it would be more viable to put that money towards BTC alone and hold or use it as you wish.
The other thing I have noticed is praise and legitimate suspicion for [new companies]( accepting BTC in exchange for various products and services.  The suspicion also solidifies the value of BTC as a currency that people do not want to lose as well as something people have invested their fiat into.
Of course this is what I have gathered from the community and what you take in from it may be very different.  It's exciting for me to see people embrace BTC as a currency so naturally those comments and posts stick with me, which may not be true for you.
There is also [this]( highly upvoted meme that was posted recently, but memes are memes are memes.
**Edit:**  I strayed from what you were originally asking a source for, sorry about that.  As far as it's intended use on creation it is a digital currency and may or may not have been developed for financial gain.  Good catch.

Yep, the way it's painted on the outside makes it look like two different buildings, but it's not.
The one cool thing was the wall of tannerite, but it's mostly MRE's and mall ninja knives.

Explosions are the best reactive targets.

I used to work by this place. I went in once out of curiosity, and half of it is an AstroTurf store.
