Yep, still a realistic concern. I tend to believe we'll see a million before we see zero, though, if either of those ever comes. Bitcoin has a certain gravity that has already pulled in countless people (and great minds) across the globe.

Yep. The significance for Bitcoin, the fact Facebook is developing Libra, and of course, Trump as president.

Plenty of weak hands and impatient types to go around. Luckily for the rest of us, they create downward price pressure when they fold.
Nobody knows what the future holds, except for those without vision.

How are you feeling today with WF's continued incompetence and tens of thousands of customers having issues accessing their money, getting their paychecks through direct deposit, etc.? This has nothing to do with the "moon" and everything to do with accountability in the backing sector.

It's been offline for over 24 hours for many WF customers. Threads all over Reddit with people who are completely screwed because their direct deposits haven't come through, and who at best are hugely inconvenienced by having to go to a branch in person or implement hacky workarounds to access their money.

Yes, I have seen plenty. Furthermore, I am not suggesting crypto exchanges aren't seriously flawed. Just that the Bitcoin network itself is extremely robust, while the networks underlying traditional stable structures like Fiat banks are not.
The decentralized and cryptographically protected model of data storage, code execution, etc. is fundamentally stronger than a highly centralized and inadequately redundant model - and this is the single most important difference between the two.
One is prone to failure, corruption, and vulnerability in a much bigger way than the other. As a case in point, if you were running a huge Bitcoin node and had the same fire WF experienced in their data center nobody would ever know (most likely). Your node would go offline, but the impact on the greater network would be insignificant.

It's a huge +1 for crypto and -1 for Fiat. You have to understand there is a sliding scale of trust, reliability, and reputability. Even incremental events such as this eventually contribute to a greater consensus being formed (or not) that can change outcomes in a big way for society. This is the precise reason politicians care about fractions of percentage changes in poll numbers. You always want the momentum moving in your direction.

The Satoshi paper. The independence. The deflation. The existing and anticipated future price appreciation. The fact existing currencies suck balls.

What do you recommend for business banking?
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:32:15
Agreed. The ongoing development and investment in crypto is exciting, and I think it's important to value the cumulative effect of many small deeds... but 2.9M could easily just be a rounding error for Samsung.

What's interesting is that many things do have value (and increase in value) because of the "consensus" that grows around them. And yet if there isn't an additional "fundamental" value beneath the consensus, it's easy to begin labeling the thing as a Ponzi, or herd mentality, or whatever.
At the same time, plenty of things (including Fiat) that are no longer backed by the gold standard are held up entirely by the consensus that exists along with other intangibles, but are considered "legitimate" by most lay people because it comes with government branding. But really it's just a strong enough consensus to become a self fulfilling prophecy.
Where something really starts to look like a Ponzi, however, is when it's a financial investment opportunity that is marketed as superior to other investments.
For that matter, I think HODL memes may contribute to the Ponzi perception because a big concept within HODL is the idea of joining a superior investment opportunity.
But there is also another concept that underlies HODL, which stems from a very real belief in the potential of this industry, and which basically says "we need some people to HODL to stabilize this thing." And in that regard it's more socially motivated.
The other reason I don't think HODL necessarily gives a Ponzi perception is that most everyone involved (and especially those not involved) are reasonably aware of the risks, price changes, and general instability of the industry.
Not to mention true believers (HODLers) are playing a long game, like any other patient long term investor, which feels like a lot more like Benjamin Graham than Bernie Madoff.
For that matter, I would say HODL at least equally gives the perception of legitimacy even while some may perceive it as something different.

Not very good if the economy is not growing, however. I agree stagnant wages are the main issue.

Reporting for duty. And luckily, I bought at $2K in 2017. But even if I had bought at $20K I would still be hodling today. If you believe in the tech, the idea, and the social movement behind it all, then it always makes sense to hodl.
