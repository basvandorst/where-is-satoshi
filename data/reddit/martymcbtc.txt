If you sit down in the back seat of a car and there's a gun pointed in your face, having a gun on your ankle probably won't help you. Could make things worse.
Not saying you shouldn't have a CCW, but it won't prevent this type of thing in most cases IMO. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 06:13:59
You're putting the cart before the horse my friend. The cost of mining approaches the price, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:19:39
And my pick.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:18:48
What am I arguing?
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:41:38
It may be small now, but the advantage it will provide is monumental, and the game theory choices are clear to those who understand. As the other reply says, the rich and powerful don't get that way by revealing their plans. Whoever doesn't jump on the blockchain will lose out because someone else will. Therefore it is inevitable, like certain choices in a heavily weighted prisoner's dilemma. But just because the choices are clear does not mean they will reveal their plans and it also doesn't mean that more than a small fraction of the population will understand it right away (or ever, even after this comes to fruition).

Seems like Peter Todd is a plant whose motive is to undermine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:31:40
Let's not forget the Bitcoin is potentially self-financing. The economic benefits of Bitcoin may be more than enough to pay for the technical improvements required to scale it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:53:16
Yeah, but the point is mining will increase or decrease such that the cost of mining is roughly equal to the return. If someone figures out how to mine more cheaply, eventually they (or others copying their methods) will ramp up mining such that the cost of mining approaches the price of bitcoin. Discovering a cheap way to mine does not drive price down!
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:45:50
I was looking at bitstamp
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:37:23
Absolutely. Essentially a consensus is forming that this is the basis for the new global economy, that even Goldman Sachs is in on. Think they will just go ahead without creating a little doubt and shaking out some more weak hands? 
But then again, are Peter Todd, Adam Back, etc. actually in on that? I wouldn't make that claim, but I don't know.

Maybe he meant politically untenable...
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:02:06
Not May :-p

That's compared to 1gbps spec for 4G.
Doesn't mean that bandwidth will all be reaching an individual phone. Still, 20x in 3-4 years is pretty cool.

With decentralization (unshuttabledownness) will come liquidity. Agreed that today Augur couldn't serve the function OP talked about but one day it can.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:08:15


I take it you are one of the exceptions? 
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:17:14
Nah, there will be more money to be made by the billionaires in defecting from fiat to this new system (Bitcoin). The whole thing will fall without a shot being fired. Classic prisoner's dilemma.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:15:20
They can at the same time slow down development through bikeshedding and "simple sabotage" methods (courtesy of CIA), and make Bitcoin stagnate and seem untenable while they usher in their next-best thing (which won't have to be as good as Bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:20:36
It's not ideal in the short run but in the long-run it might actually be better. It would create some temporary brand confusion, but would demonstrate the truly earth-shaking, decentralized character of this evolving cybernetic organism. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:10:12
Did you read the headline correctly?
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:25:21
I like Gavins non-partisan approach to contributing to multiple clients. Maybe whoever threatens to leave over this we are better off without. A bump in blocksize is not worth leaving over and the potential for a new dominant client only demonstrates a decentralized character of the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:08:07
To me, classic has legitimacy, and deserves the name Bitcoin, so it is not spam on and therefore does not go hand in hand with ethereum spam. To each his own. Economic reality is what will rule the end of the day, not my opinion, or your opinion.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:08:40
They will. Check alternative subs
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:30:19


My comment was in response to that. Many miners ARE  requesting a bump in blocksize. If you think what miners desire is relevant (as I do), then I point you back to my suggestion above. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:02:33
I wouldn't lump Bitcoin classic interest with Ethereum spam. Look into it on subs where this is not considered offtopic if you're sincerely interested.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:39:16
Seems like a reasonable question, lol.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:08:11
I do think it's Mike's strategy. He knew that his blog post could be simultaneously a warning call (with him as Martyr) to the community as well as being perceived as a "propaganda" win by R3. He's a smart guy, if perhaps a lower frustration tolerance threshold than some others.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:11:16
So then go with something like Bitcoin Unlimited. Let the miners decide. An artificially limited Bitcoin will die. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:49:18
This is such a ridiculous statement that it makes me wonder if this is his way of signaling that he is hostage of the Chinese government.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:18:41
I'm a believer in Classic and a blocksize limit bump, and have suspected the small-blockists to be part of a sabotage movement. This move would demonstrate the courage of their convictions, and would gain my respect. Let the best chain win.

Bitcoins can remain BTC. bits can be the native unit on Lightning network.

He wasn't making an argument, therefore it's not an ad hom. He was just giving you advice.
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:58:02
I'd say less. Much of the early bitcoins were mined very cheaply and then appreciated in value. If the cost of mining roughly approaches the value of those bitcoins (MC=MR, or whatever) then the total amount of electricity put into mining is something like the sum of the value of all the block rewards *at the time they were issued* (minus hardware costs).
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:36:52
It'd be nice to hear something a bit more substantial.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:06:00
If it's more than that... then miners are at major, major losses. It is simply not the case.

He's already put together a plan which will not be implemented until January at the earliest. He is taking his vacation now so he is fresh and ready for what is to come.
