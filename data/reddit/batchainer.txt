The devs are independent, they work on what they want or what they are paid to work on. If you disagree you get your hands dirty coding or hire someone. Same as Linux.

Miners should be allowed to pick their policies.
I wonder if the additional complexity required for the priority policy means this policy should be maintained separately by interested miners

Unbanked != Poorest!
Fees are inevitable in a decentralised system. You can reduce them and optimise them but the result is at the cost of more centralisation.
What is cheaper, Walmart or the family run shop? Do you know why?  It's because economy of scale and in Bitcoin one would want to optimise everything but not the decentralised nature.

@_date: 2015-12-22 10:01:35
If you had a clue you would know that it would hurt Chinese miners only if they had the minority of hashrate. If they have 66% then bigger blocks would give them a big advantage. They don't have to wait for propagation outside the great firewall of China before they start mining on the next block on top of the one they just found.
Read again: it's the people with the minority of hashrate on whichever side of the great firewall of China that will suffer the most.
Buy a clue.

Sad you are a prominent wallet developer with such confused views. You believe miners are in control and not nodes? 
Of course there's a chance an spv wallet developer would think that.
You think leaving 25% hashing power + many unknown nodes behind or forcing them is good?

Hi mike

Most of the devs want a Bitcoin resistant to political whim. They won't move to classic, you only get left overs like Jeff and Gavin who haven't contributed for a hell of a long time. 
Good luck Bitcoin ~~original~~  ~~xt~~ classic benevolent dictator :P

@_date: 2016-01-26 09:41:21
You'd think that but no. what is also interesting is that coinbase is not listening to their own CTO. They just want to fork at any cost. Maybe they  have too many liabilities in Bitcoin?
The same as Cryptsy recently "hacked": remember the founder of classic is the CTO of Cryptsy Marshall Long. The relation with Garza of Paycoin should be enough?
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:45:54

Dude it is unreasonable, there is a road map signed by the super majority of Bitcoin contributors which provides a similar capacity increase in a safer manner, do you know better and think they are all wrong?
Gavin is just a man he can be wrong. He has been wrong in the past.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:27:31
And don't trust some random CPU! :)
@_date: 2016-01-26 09:45:30
It counts as a capacity increase. Or would you rather have double the block size but triple the size of each transaction?
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:05:44
Nobody is forced you can always use litecoin, nxt or classic

The problem is that you already agreed on Bitcoin classic. I don't think you are a good CEO. Imho coinbase should not be added back but I agree the drama was too much.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:32:42

It's great, I love what Jr did for Bitcoin, to think that Gavin wanted to ban him from development ... it would have been totally crazy

You call it backlog but with dynamic minimum relay fee and mempool limits there won't be any backlog just underpaying transactions that never got propagated

Should Bitcoin hard fork every time two developers out of dozens think they know better? Tired of this shit!
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:43:56
He said that but you need consensus that we clearly don't have
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:49:28
And where do you plan on finding these developers, on a tree?
@_date: 2016-01-31 11:37:33
The attack to Bitcoin came from them, they knew?
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:50:50
I am concerned and disappointed by Gavin's continuous attempts at splitting Bitcoin first with XT now with classic. There is no confidence left in such things
I would feel better if he collaborated more instead
Should he not then it would be professional to renounce his Bitcoin core git commit privileges
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:56:37
Why should we care shapeshit a scamcoins brokerage you kept secret for a while doesn't support core? You will support anything that may make you money including the two/three? branches of Bitcoin after a contentious hard fork.
You are a good business man I give you that

It ain't real. It's not about the limit. It's about setting a centralised and regulated path for Bitcoin and its future.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:34:14
Because you would need to know the future and the results of sw + weak blocks etc before you know what can be safe

I'll pick Peter. An adult is worse than a child sometimes. Clearly Peter can think smarter outside of the box without calling for banning Luke like Gavin tried.
@_date: 2016-02-06 20:19:00
Really? Just core? No wallet use that and core only with 0.12
@_date: 2016-02-02 12:52:33
Coinbase is still there and it supports classic. Same goes for bci and bitpay/copay, never removed. FUD much?
@_date: 2016-02-19 10:07:39
Wtf??? Addresses have checksums
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:17:52
Agree but still better than mytrezor . com and both devices can be used with Electrum.
@_date: 2016-02-06 10:32:46

Decentralised is not useful by itself what is useful is that it makes censorship impossible. We need to be extremely careful when we adventure in making Bitcoin changes that reduce our effectiveness against censorship. Once you go over the tip it's game over.

Buttcoiners other than jstolfi can be very reasonable. They often joke about justified limitations or meme. They often bring reality. They find important things from scammers, moon claims, shitty code, incredibility incompetent people you name it.

Why is the method written to include privacy leaks if not used?
To have any credibility you should not have used bc or any service from the alliance of spying.
What are you waiting for to open source it? What is it that are you worried about?
You can't call this a privacy wallet. Implementing payment codes is not going to change any of that.

 Only XT has done that.

It's not obvious why would they need a proof of payment? Don't they know already?
