* $1 Million dollars in forum funds on a "new forum platform" which when reviewing the code is nothing more than a stand alone version of drupal's forum module which you could hire a guy in India to do for less than $20,000 usd.
* over a dozen DDOS attacks in the past 90 days.
* They cant afford $20 a month on DDOS protection. 
When is everyone going to wake up and realize whats going on?
The entire forum is so quick to jump to conclusions and lable anything a scam without cause or the slightest shred of evidence. But when the most OBVIOUS scam in bitcoin history is well past underway everyone sits idle like nothing is going on. 
Bitchcointalk.org users are hilarious.

It's convenient, I like that i don't have to handle printing myself and don't have to keep inventory. Would be better if they accepted bitcoin directly themselves. but that goes for most any place. Although i have had only 2 orders for the prints since i posted them on bitcointalk.org . I am starting to get the feeling that bitcoin is starting to settle down and a lot of people have jumped ship. Last year when i posted a print i did i had sold over 100 of them in a week. Now, everyone on that list is not around any more. Inactive on BCT for months and "not interested in bitcoin any more" when i e-mail them.
