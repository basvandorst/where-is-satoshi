Anyone that owns less than 10BTC should not be allowed to have an opinion at this summit.

I am not sure I agree with you here. That’s what happened in Argentina in 2014.

Reddit has lost its sense of humor or failing to understand sarcasm.
Edit: added sarcasm.

I invested in NASH ICO.

No, if I am being honest but I have good relationship with the buyers.

I agree with all the previous answers but I think they are failing to answer your KEY question, which is - IS IT SAFE FOR YOU TO EXCHANGE YOUR EUROS FOR BTC IN REVOLUT?
The answer is - YES. As you are not actually holding any BTC yourself. Revolut is actually the custodian/you only get the price exposure.
But, again, as mentioned by others, you won't be able to transfer the BTC outside of the Revolut eco-system.

I'll edit that to 'for' instead of on. My bad. Thank you! Ha

Question for any experts...if I bought coins for $115 like this chap and buy a Lambo - with the coins, would I not be paying tax?
Novice here.

I agree! I think it means he bought it 'with bitcoin'

Jeez, take a joke penny.
