Your entire comment is incorrect.


So what? That is irrelevant, **it doesn't make the dollar less fungible**. Fungibility has nothing to do with banks and how they treat cash.


This couldn't be farther from the truth. People and dealerships sell houses and cars for cash, usually at lower rates.


That's why there are bank runs right? Because cash is useless when a bank fails? If a bank fails, your cash is still good.

Just cuz they didn't have success doesn't mean it is fungible.


That's now what fungibility is. Fungible simple means each unit is the same as any other. All USD are the same and worth the same.
Now that I think of it, cash dollars have serial numbers on them and a quick Google revealed that [people sell dollars with amusing serial numbers for more money]( Does that mean cash money isn't necessarily fungible? I'm not sure if it does but I guess you could make that argument as every unit is not exactly the same, but electronic dollars (as in those in your bank account) would be fungible.

I heard (could be wrong) that miners sell their "fresh" bitcoins for considerably more than market value. Even if the answer to your question is "no", bitcoin still isn't considered fungible because every bitcoin is different.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:13:06
Perhaps, I could be wrong but I read somewhere that they are worth more. In either case, bitcoin is not considered fungible which is supposed to be primary characteristic of money and currency.

Wow there are so many retards here. Even more than I previously thought.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:03:21


Fungibility means each dollar is worth the same amount. This is true for cash. Just because it is hard to deposit a lot at one time doesn't have to do with the fungibility of the cash but with policies and regulations.


Lmao I know the claimed reason (may not be the real reason), but it doesn't change my point. If a bank fails, you would be much better off with cash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:18:09
How do inactive coins influence the price? If the amount of inactive coins is not counted in the "circulating supply" figure and doesn't influence the market cap, how would it change the price? Isn't the price just the most recent rate that someone paid in an exchange?

It hit 25K CAD earlier today according to the xe.com chart.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:37:11


No you didn't, you showed me one specific case where you made it sound bad to have 100k in cash. Consider this, what happens when your bank becomes insolvent? Then your 100k is gone and in that case, it is much better to have it in cash.
Anyway, it doesn't even matter if cash isn't fungible - it doesn't change my point that bitcoin isn't fungible. My point has nothing to do with USD.

Bitcoin should be renamed shitcoin cuz the median tx fee is over $14 and it is not usable as a currency anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:32:47


Last time I went to a dealership a few years ago, they took cash and it was cheaper if you paid cash. I just googled it and dealerships still do. Maybe it's different in the US but it's always been like this in Canada.


What kind of shitty logic is this? Do you even know how the economy works? If a bank fails, money is still used. A bank failure doesn't mean they just stop using the fiat currency. If a bank fails, depositors in that bank lose their money **but their cash is still good**.


Bruh we have had bank runs IN THIS CENTURY. I'm going to stop replying in this thread - Idk if you're trolling or just really poorly informed. Literally everything you say is wrong and it takes too much energy trying to correct it all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:21:55
It's also not fungible - not all BTC are equal. Freshly mined btc are worth more than older ones.

Comment thread OP wasn't talking about millionaires outside America.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:40:43
I know, this is exactly what the OP of this comment thread stated. He didn't say there are 11 million in the world. He was talking about American millionaires.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:37:56
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:17:49
How so? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:46:22
16 million bitcoins - 11 million millionaires = 5 million BTC left over for us plebs  
Where is the problem here?

No, America is the only country in the world. I don't exist because I am in Canada. /s
Look at the OP of this comment thread, he is talking about American millionaires.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:45:42
Tell that to the OP of this comment thread. What he said was logical and that is all I'm defending.

I understand, but one can always think bigger and get greedier. I'm no expert but I have a feeling it could crash at some point, and I just have the fear of waiting too long.
Mind if I ask what you plan on doing? I don't see any alternative to choosing an arbitrary point to start selling at.

Hmm interesting... Your right about fiat becoming obsolete. The collapse of the dollar is not just anyone's opinion but a mathematical certainty - I was getting in to precious metals to insure against that scenario. The Zionists/Illuminati/central-banking-cartel will try to implement a cashless society with one world currency, making all of these decentralized cryptos a huge threat to their plan. Cryptos certainly do seem to be a thing of the future and I agree that eventually, it is all we'll have; I'm just interested to see what the globalists' move will be to do to take down the cryptos. The economic collapse will be interesting. Good luck!

Lol. I'm basically in the same boat as you, but I'm looking to hold for years and I think eventually it will shoot up beyond 10k. The drop we are seeing now only scares the shit out of us because we have only been in the game for such a short time.

Haha god damn, that sucks. Definitely is a shit feeling watching the value drop. I suppose it's best to consider your money gone soon as you put it in, that way you'll be less disappointed when it tanks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:13:53


Economists have been warning us about an economic crash and collapse of the USD. I guess that has something to do with it. Here's to hoping!

@_date: 2017-05-26 00:56:28
Why not sell at 10k? That was my plan but I don't really know what I'm doing so I'd like to hear your reasoning. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:18:50
I'm no expert but from my understanding, the value will drop if the hard fork occurs but you will also have bitcoin on two separate blockchains. I'll stick around for an answer from someone who knows what they're talking about, though.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:46:34
Lol you seem to have accidentally a word or two; also wouldn't hurt to include some punctuation in your sentence/question.
It seems you've got public debt confused with private debt. When the govt borrows money from the central bank, they run up the public debt. When I buy something with my credit card, it increases my own personal, private debt.
The $19 trillion figure is the US public debt. The whole economy is just one big scam, see [this comment]( of mine for more info.
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:20:58
I see what you're saying. The discrepancy between the two would just grow wider over time. Is this what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic?
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:49:16
Hmm interesting... Is there any chance (even a small chance) that both would become successful and competitive?
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:31:59
Hmmm I was told you'd have bitcoin on both chains. I have no idea how it works so I could be totally wrong. Doing my best to learn it all before Aug 1 lol.
