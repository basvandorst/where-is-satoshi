When you say “inequality”, are you ignoring the fact that only a small percentage of the world are either poor or rich? It seems as if you are focusing on the extremes.
Bitcoins won’t save the economy. The economy will crash again. Actually, some banks are even doing the very same thing that helped cause the crash in 2008! 
And you don’t need that much. You can own class B shares as well. They are cheaper. Although, who said you had to invest in Berkshire Hathaway? As strong as they are, there are countless of good businesses to invest in!

That was... mean.

There are very few countries in the world where they would just take those things away from you (if any). Taxes doesn’t count. Taxes is just a way of contributing to society. We all benefit from taxes.
At the end of the day, you are depending on the next man to be willing to pay more for your bitcoins than you did. A farm will provide you with food either way.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:23:43
It doesn’t. I don’t think you understand what I am saying. Bitcoins literally doesn’t produce anything.
No, I didn’t come here to learn. Do you really believe I do my research on Reddit? That would be foolish! No, I came here to hear your perspective on things. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:21:11
No, because I agree with him. If he talked highly of it, I still wouldn’t have touched bitcoins. 
And, let’s be honest, Charlie Munger understands bitcoin better than we ever will.

A strong and dedicated consumer base is very important. 
I wouldn’t say dismal. Overall, their investments usually turn out to be quite profitable. 
Can you give me some reasons why I should be able to invest in bitcoins AND feel good about it? How am I supposed to feel certain that I will actually profit from this in, say, the next five or ten years? To me, it seems like pure luck if you make money from this. I think it’s a trend that will sooner or later fall out.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:05:18
Hah! I thought that analogy was quite funny. 
If you know who Charlie Munger is, you’ll also know that, statistically, he knows more about this than all of us.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:24:52
But it doesn’t even have to be stocks. It could be something like a farm. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:28:43
Let me put it this way: most people in the world are able to afford everything they need. Are they poor? No, not at all. If you look at the American standards, or in my case, Scandinavian, it’s certainly below the poverty line. However, it’s not actually poverty. At least not on the extreme end. It’s all relative because we are used to high standards. Most people are in the middle, which means they can’t afford fancy apple products etc. They can still afford everything they need though.

Hah! 
Perhaps my soul is old (I’m 22), but I see no immediate value in crypto currencies. I can see what you are saying, but cellphones were revolutionary. Crypto currencies are not something this world actually needs. I’m not saying that there are no positive sides, but they still don’t actually produce anything of value. It just seems like a foolish and risky investment in my opinion. How are you supposed to know what the next ten years will be like? Banks are fine. People don’t need bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:42:14
No, it’s the truth. You can look up the statistics for yourself. UN does a lot of good work in this area.
What is your definition of poverty?
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:05:00
71 percent of the world does not live in poverty.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:51:11
Sure. Once you put your money into the bank it is basically their money. They can just keep it if they want. They don’t even have to inform you. And if the government wants your house tomorrow, you better start packing your bags tonight.
No, it doesn’t. 
I haven’t brought up Berkshire Hathaway once. What I do with my money won’t end up on Reddit (or anywhere else online). It’s certainly an admirable company though.
I don’t have to know everything about it in order to be interested. The technology is fascinating, but I would never invest my money in something that doesn’t produce anything of value.
 I understand what you are saying, but people can’t live without cellphones. People can live without bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:19:17
No, not really. That’s not the way democracy works. Even in North Korea they’re not going to just take people’s properties away. 
Sure, but some of those things produces something of value. I don’t think neither you nor anyone else here actually understands what I mean by it. Bitcoin produces nothing. A farm produces food. You don’t find food valuable? You can either sell that food and make a profit off of it, or you can eat the food so you don’t starve. 
I’ve stated this at least once already, but there is no way I will ever invest in bitcoins. I will never regret it because it makes me sleep better. If I invest in something that I believe in, fluctuations won’t matter. I’ll sleep well and, if I am correct, I will also make a profit. Bitcoins feels like pure luck. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:05:43
Nor do I invest in any of those.
But how is this a sound investment? A good investment should produce something of value. 
This isn’t meant as an attack of any sorts. I simply want a perspective different than my own. I know why I wouldn’t invest in bitcoins, but why are there so many people who wishes to invest in it? What is it that I am failing to see? As a side note, bitcoins also opens up for more criminal activities. This is something I feel shouldn’t be ignored.

Well, I’ve read books and watched documentaries where defectors have shared their experiences. I don’t know how things are today, but Kim Jong Un seems to take better care of the people than his father did.
A farm does produce food. Whether or not it is easy doesn’t matter. The end result is food on the table. 
Maybe, maybe not. My point is that it isn’t necessary. It doesn’t produce anything of value. How are you supposed to know how people feel about it in ten years? There are a lot of people who are critical of bitcoins, who’s to say that this number won’t increase?
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:01:19
80 percent of the world!? Are you insane!? Where do you get your numbers from?
And bitcoins will save the economy? 
Did I ever say this? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:07:56
A decade of growth doesn’t necessarily mean anything.
People being interested in it now doesn’t guarantee any future interest in it.
The bank doesn’t control me or my life. What are you talking about? And what you are talking about might be enticing to some, but it still doesn’t produce anything of value. It’s not something that the world needs. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:21:57
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:24:14
That depends on what you invest in. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:03:54
The companies do. 
This was just an example. A farm produces something of value.
