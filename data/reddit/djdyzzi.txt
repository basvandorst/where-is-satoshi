If only they had bitcoin cash support. I've waited too long for coinbase to add it, sorry.

Ok, so 1 person lol. Just check all the posts down the page.

If you actually read my comment. I clearly state "the main posts on here", meaning not by me. Please take your meds homie, and calm down. Nothing here could possibly incite that sort of anger in a sane individual xD

My friend bought $5 bitcoin, then freaked out when she only got 3. Needless to say, that's one less crypto user, and she will most likely spread that story too. So I don't think fees are "just a detail".

What lesson? Bitcoin is shit? Cuz Idk about you, but I don't think that's a lesson people should learn...

Does trazor have altcoin support? Idk is I read about that or not haha.

Doesn't that drive away mass adoption? Don't be an elitist dick.

Didn't get to read the comment btw

Isn't core the one that wanted segwit? Then why has it taken this long to update? Kinda sad really, pretty sure core should have been the first, if that's the case.

But you would pay the person telling them to work, then proceeding to do absolutely nothing, that wage
