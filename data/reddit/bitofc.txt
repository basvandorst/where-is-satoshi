no worry at all, those are separate entity in China that may have 51% of total hash power.  Also as pointed out earlier, for example likes antpool has many individuals in other countries point their miner to antpool.  I doubt antpool has any motive to manipulate the blockchain.

The probability of rolling a six from a dice is 1/6 but you are not going to roll a six in every six rolls.  This is normal and within std deviation.

Glad to see that Nick has the same view as mine.  I certainly do not understand why 2 ways replay protection is not being implemented for segwit2x?  That is a good thing for both parties and everyone else who use bitcoin network.

no proper replay attack protection by segwit2x is simply a clear big no-no for anyone to support segwit2x.
