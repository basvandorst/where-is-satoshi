Don't throw your money away with those scam sites. Hope you didn't lose too much.

It's about bitcoin

Just keep buying a little every now and then. Set aside a certain amount from each paycheck and make a habit of it. Before you know it, you'll have a nice chunk of coin. In the long term the price will keep rising so you'll be ok. If you keep waiting for a drop, you'll keep kicking yourself saying you should have bought yesterday.

I haven't used Coinbase. Besides having poor support, how are their fees and verification process? I refuse to use any exchange that requires a photo with payment card or ID or SSN. I wanted to try CEX.io but they wanted all this and more. I quickly deleted my account. The support was at least helpful in those regards.

Here's where it got started...

You want to head over to localbitcoins. But be aware of scammers. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:04:41
Cool. Let me know when you win. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:32:28
I'm not sure about other wallets, but Jaxx lets you pair your wallet with multiple devices so you can access it from your phone or computer. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:07:38
It's better than not buying any bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:02:40
They have the most insane verification process I've ever seen. I didn't feel comfortable enough to hand over so much personal information to set up an account with them. If you're ok with sending them your SSN along with pictures of your credit/debit card and I.D. then go for it, for me that was a deal breaker. In the TOS they mention that they can share your info with their affiliates and third parties. No thanks.

I plan on hodling regardless, but what makes you so sure it will be heaven?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:33:39
Yeah I'm kinda nervous to do that. I don't want it to reset. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:55:48
Nice try IRS
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:36:48
If you control the keys to your wallet your coins should be safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:01:45
If it drops I'm buying more. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:11:04
I have some old worn out boxers. How much you think I could get for them?
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:29:18
My only critique is that you used quite a lot of tech jargon that is likely to go over the heads of most lay people. Otherwise, great job!
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:21:57
I wish I would have got in sooner too, but in the grand scheme of things, we're only in the beginning. It's definitely not too late. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:48:23
Be careful what you share with these exchanges. Make sure you read the TOS. Some of them have no problem sharing your info with their affiliates and third parties. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:36:09
Don't let your emotions get the best of you. If you don't even know where to buy bitcoins, you probably shouldn't be trying to buy that much in one go anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:51:58
What are the alternatives to buying with credit cards? Bitcoin Atm's have hefty fees too. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:28:35
I keep fighting the urge to hit the buy button. Gotta get some sleep at some point tonight. Do you think it will keep dropping tomorrow?

See if she will agree to starting out with a small investment. You don't have to buy a full bitcoin. Just buy $100 worth and watch it grow for a little while. Seeing the gains for herself may convincer her. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:36:25
$10,000 by end of year
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:58:47
First, get a wallet...  
Then register on an exchange... 
Then buy bitcoins with either your bank account or credit card. Note: there are fees on most transactions. Once you have your bitcoins, send them to your wallet. It is not a good idea to keep them on an exchange... Look up Mt. Gox. 
Since you're a noob, just start out small. You don't have to buy a full bitcoin. Most people start out with about $100 worth. Hold it in your wallet and don't let the fomo get to you. 
Hope that helps a little. There are lots of videos on YouTube that will teach you in much more detail. Just absorb as much information as you can. These are exciting times we are living in.

It's going up to $4800 by Friday night. Watch.

Who knows. But the trend has been up for a long time now and is slowly starting to creep in to the mainstream. If you don't have faith in it, get out just as you would with any other investment. Its all speculative so you shouldn't have any more in than you can afford to lose anyway. Personally, I believe in it and plan to ride this rollercoaster all the way. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:29:13
This guy is just mad cause he doesn't have any bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:20:17
No Jaxx?
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:45:55
14 year olds that will soon be millionaires. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:50:21
Good thing bitcoin isn't a stock exchange. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:23:25
I know the answer I'm just not telling. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:41:55
True, but bitcoin is still new. As it gets more exposure and becomes more mainstream, more and more people will be buying and hodling than playing the market.
