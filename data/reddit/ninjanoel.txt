Can't tell if this is an attempt at humour or something?

Well you kinda made it sound like "because no inflation therefore rich and poor will exist", when I think the disparity between rich and poor is exactly BECAUSE of the inflationary money supply.
Many economists may point out that quantitative easing (printing money) is often so poor people can eat, but in reality, yes it feeds the poor but it also impoverishes the rest of us in the process, making more people dependant on the printing of money

I've never used an exchange for fiat, because OTC is default for fiat, but lacking adoption means exchanges are essential, but if everyone has btc then exchanges aren't really needed

Wish they would declare Bitcoin illegal, that would 100x the market cap, hardly anyone takes cryptocurrencies seriously (as a percentage of planet people) but making laws about it would introduce the other 99% to Bitcoin and it's ilk, which means lambos for every one in here probably.

The "haves" will need to spend, and the "nots" will want to provide services for the "haves" to spend on.
Really the biggest difference is that when you acquire bitcoin its value is not being stolen via printing more notes like fiat currency. The "nots" are "mostly" not responsible for "not having", the system funnels money upward, which Bitcoin will change.
Fiat and governments printing money is one of the causes of much wealth inequality

well.. i know the urge to day trade is strong, but honestly, just use coinbase or bitpanda or kraken or a something similar. coinbase lets you buy and sell btc into fiat, in the UK i can sell for GBP or EUR.
It's like you wanna start juggling so went straight to flaming swords while walking a tight rope, start slow and small and say within your ability and knowledge or you'll end up hurting.

friend, etoro doesn't sell bitcoin!!!!
You're placing a bet, which could net you ZERO dollars return, buying ACTUAL bitcoin means you ride the volatility but are never left with nothing.
Buying $2k of ***real*** bitcoin is a way better 'bet'
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:18:59
fyi... the fact that these platforms call it 'trading' is a huge problem
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:34:52
well... if you can withdraw you always should anyway, so take them up on that offer of withdrawing, never leave coins on an exchange, if you don't have your own private key you don't own your own coins, etoro is miles worse than 'leaving it on the exchange' because i dont even think it is an exchange (despite what CS Rep says)

I get the best prices on coinbase

Only every buy direct from manufacturer, anything else could be compromised

real crypto exchanges have no need for account managers

CFD platforms are so full of fraud and you can NEVER trust a salesman, DO NOT USE ETORO for 'buying' bitcoin.
It's a contract for difference, and CFD's always have 'account managers' that have to hit targets etc, price manipulation is a serious an issue, cause if they prices moves beyond your margin for a SECOND you lose it ALL, so it's really easy for them to put humps and bumps in the price that close your bets and leave you with NOTHING!
Also, on their front page they state 66% of people lose money, that is ALL the money of those 66%, it's not like they spent $100 and walked away with $80, they spent $100 and got NOTHING back, nothing. DON'T use etoro!!!!!!!!

you are betting on the price, etoro, as far as I'm aware, is for CFD trading (contract for difference), i.e. margin trading. They allow you to bet on the movement on the coin, but thats all it is, if you look for the withdraw option, if you cant put in a bitcoin address anywhere, and can only withdraw fiat, that proves all you are doing is betting.
CFD's are a financial instrument used for hedging, you are given a 'margin', usually a ratio, i.e. 1:10, means you deposit $10 and can make a bet on $100 of some commodity, in this case you are choosing bitcoin. Fancy finance people use hedging as a DIY insurance tool (see 'for instance' below). 
The danger with CFD's are that if the price moves in the opposite direction of your bet, then the price movement eats into your margin (your REAL smaller amount that you used as leverage) until you've no leverage left, then they 'close your position' and steal yo woman and don't give you your money back.
for instance: buy $100 of REAL USD (bought with GBP), then use etoro to buy a $10 CFD for $100 worth of GBP. if USD goes up, you lose your etoro bet, if USD goes down (in relation to GBP) then you start winning on your etoro bet but your REAL assets in USD are worth less, but either way you come out OK because you hedged. retailer investors like you and me hardly ever use CFD's for hedging as it's intended.
Please, i would love to be proven wrong, but just signed up to etoro to make sure I'm not talking out my arse, and I could only find a withdraw in fiat, no crypto withdraw. Can anyone else confirm etoro is ONLY cfd's?

$100K in 10 years? $100 Million more like :-D

Well, on etoro you are allocating 5% of your portfolio to a bet on bitcoin

You don't need a hardware wallet to keep funds safe. Just don't store anything on an exchanges
