This proves only that he has control of that address,  so unless that (unused) address is yours, don't waste your time on this very poorly executed scam.

Yes, I agree with all that. But he literally claimed that that specific address holds 58 BTC. I'm not joking.
And, as I mentioned in another comment, OP should be able to at least show us an address with funds that haven't moved in three years. It wouldn't be hard proof of anything, but I'd still like to see it.

Then I'll blow your mind: Just ask OP and he'll give you the entire address.

None of that makes any sense.
  
OP has given us an encrypted private key. If you find the passphrase, you can spend the 1 mBTC available, proving that someone has the passphrase in the process. It's very simple to do if you have the passphrase, and there's no downside to doing it, so the fact that the 1 mBTC hasn't moved makes it a virtual certainty that you don't have the passphrase. You're either attempting to scam OP, or you have no idea what this is about.   
You won't find false positives. And a billion passphrases isn't a lot.

Has anyone received indication that OP has any funds, locked or otherwise, at all? I've asked him multiple times over the past 5 days, but he keeps giving me the same address (ending with YfD9ZK) claiming it contains 58 BTC, when it in reality contains 0.001 BTC.

On the off-chance that you're not trolling:  
By prefix, do you mean 1124jx (which is the only part of the addr that OP has disclosed publicly, I'll give you that)? If that's the case: Is your tactic for recovering OPs funds just to attempt to find valid bitcoin addresses with that prefix?
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:41:07
You're correct, and that's why I said "indication". OP should be able to point to an address that has a substantial amount of funds, that hasn't been spent from at any point during the last three years. Also, the fact that he claims that an address holds 58 BTC, when it never held more than 0.001 BTC, doesn't exactly inspire confidence. (OP, please prove/indicate me wrong in PM. It's pretty confusing at this point)

Welcome back! And thanks. I'm happy with that address.
