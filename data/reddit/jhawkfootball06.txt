They've been reliable for me thus far. Just received my BCH from them as well a couple hours ago. I'd recommend them, it's a good exchange.

Cryptopia's BTC wallet has been offline for the past 12-24 hours. No withdrawals or deposits. Why'd you send your BTC to an offline wallet? I'm not sure what will happen to it. It may get credited when the wallet comes back online.

I don't think you understand just how much volume BTC has, and how much it takes to move it. As of this typing BTC is worth $3290. To move it to $3299 (a $9 difference), people have to buy through a $500,000+ sell wall.

Currently the best transaction fee on btc.com is 0.00116 which equates to $3.15. 
So I have to pay $3.15 for just one transaction AND have to wait a full day?

If my memory serves me right, Bitcoin was around $1,800 at the time. Absolutely incredible.

Correct, people buying and selling determine the coin's value. But let's look at this scenario.
Before split:
BTC = $2700
After split:
BTC + BCH = $3300. 
There was no fiat passed in buying BCH. You were given the tokens by the split.

You are able to transfer BTC, LTC, ETH, and BCH on Coinbase for free using the Gdax route. The same can't be said for Gemini.
