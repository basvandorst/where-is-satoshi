That's not money laundering, its tax fraud/evasion. Laundering is taking money from illegal sources (drugs, sports bets, etc) and fraudulently running it through a legitimate business or "front" to make it appear like a normal transaction.
In fact, laundering money generally means you will pay taxes on it through the front business

That's a weak excuse. No one is going to read your terms and conditions in order to check out a blog post they were linked to. I read the article, and the 'about us' and nothing in either of those pages gives an indication that the content is presented as anything but fact.
As it stands, the blog post is potentially damaging to his image and you are possibly liable for libel. Bear in mind I am not a lawyer, and it's clear he's just trying to censor you but as your site stands he may have a case. What you might try is a visible disclaimer on the top of the blog page that reads something like 'the following blog post is opinion and not to be taken as fact'

This really sucks to look at because if I'd known about bitcoin in 2010 I'd have been mining it during my military deployments. I didn't even hear about it until it was already in the low hundreds

Nah, make them earn their hourly. The more he has to employ a lawyer the more money comes out of his pocket. Make it as much a pain as possible until you're just not worth it.
Hell I'd make another blog post with this letter he sent (stating that it's opinion of course) highlighting that you believe he tried to use this strong-arm tactic and legal threats solely to censor you. Above all, don't take down the original blog or it could possibly be taken as an admission of guilt, and would let him know that such thuggish tactics are effective on you.

I don't think a judge is really going to care about that so much as they'll care about how the average person seeing the blog post will interpret the information and whether or not the person's image is measurably damaged by it.
As a rule of thumb a ToS can say whatever it wants, and usually isn't actually legally binding in any way.

Supply and demand apply. There is great demand for tobacco, if the supply was made illegal the demand would still be there and the price would go up.
If bitcoin were made illegal the supply would remain the same but the demand would go down, since there would be fewer places that would accept it vs other legal currency. Lower demand, less value.

ugh, i bought my first six a few days ago at 208, next day decided to buy another 3 but I'm locked out of coinbase until that first transaction goes through. Today it's at 236 and I'm kicking myself for not just buying 9 originally.

I have 2fa active on mine, but serious question, how much more secure does it *really* make it? If it's set up for google authenticator, doesn't that just mean they also need my gmail account (which isn't actually the email my blockchain is tied to) to hack it?
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:35:05
That's tricky though, bitcoins don't have the laws protecting them to enforce payment in the event that the borrower decides to just keep/spend the coins without the intent to pay back the debt. And as it's mentioned in the video, you have no capability to perform a chargeback with bitcoins, so any issuer would be in a very bad position when it came to fraud.

This poster is so egregiously wrong in so many ways it's impossible to decide where to begin to disassemble it.
For instance, since no one else has mentioned it, [Rosie the Riveter]( is a very pro american government piece of art, as it symbolizes women lending to the WWII war effort by working in factories and munitions plants. Pretty much dead opposite of a 'take the power back' message.

When I watched it drop I was glad I cashed out my initial investment. Now that It's back up I'm glad I didn't cash out the rest.

I'm amazed that he made no mention of the one huge advantage that makes credit cards what they are.
The entire video he just uses credit cards as a cash equivalent. But the whole point is that credit cards allow you to spend money you might not have at the moment, in the assumption that you'll have it soon. It is a loan for any small amount for anything you need, whenever/wherever you need it. with bitcoin you have to have the money on hand to make the purchase, so if you're waiting on a payday and low on btc, guess what? you're still going to turn to a credit card when your car breaks.

Your point is anything *but* clear.
You can't drink bitcoin like alcohol or shoot it up like drugs, nor can you get addicted to it and form a dependency like either of the above. This is not a valid comparison and prohibition doesn't apply.
As for your remark about Constantine I'm not sure what point you're trying to make, bitcoin isn't a religion mandated by a Roman Emperor to control the republic. It's a currency. If Caligula had suddenly said "Silver is now banned as a currency and all silver coins are to be melted down" it doesn't make the value of silver coins in Italy shoot up, it makes it tank because suddenly no merchants will take your silver coins and therefore they lose their value.
I seriously cannot follow your train of thoughts in thinking any of this draws relative comparisons to virtual currency. Especially I think you're confused about Constantine, because he didn't ban Christianity as your post seems to imply, he was the emperor that made it the primary religion of the Roman Republic. Maybe you should be the one to look into Constantine.

And that's how the location and amount of bitcoins being stored are kept track of, even in paper wallets? Because it's publicly available that the transaction was made to that address, so therefore the bitcoins must be there?
Forgive my ignorance, even after reading up on everything it can still be confusing. The idea of a paper wallet being able to receive deposits is especially hard to wrap my head around.
