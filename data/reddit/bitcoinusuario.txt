I like Bitsquare a lot. Thanks for this product.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:11:18
People should use decentralized exchanges like 
@_date: 2016-04-17 00:12:25
I think purse.io allows this kind of thing, but only for amazon products. Someone posted an idea on bitsquare github: 
I'm from Brazil and the bitcoin price here is higher than most of all other countries. I'm sure if we had a service like purse.io, but for products from aliexpress.com, will be a success. I would buy products from aliexpress, add a foreign shipping address, and receive bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:18:00
How users that doesn't have bitcoins will receive lightning payments? To receive lightning payments is necessary to open a channel?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:18:05
Donate to make lightning a reality soon.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:18:55
Fund a project to make a lightning mobile app. A beautiful one.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:03:25
You can, but they are using coinbase merchant. I think they should add a gateway that accept bitcoin lightning payment, like [globee.com]( Hope he consider it.
@_date: 2018-09-27 11:58:12
Great. Sent you the PM. Let us know when you integrate globee. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:04:45
Hi, as I can see you accept bitcoin with coinbase merchant. Please add the [globee.com]( or [coingate.com]( gateway, they support bitcoin lightning payment. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:07:21
I think Bitlendingclub is loanbase now, right? I don't think they allow users choose the interest rates.

@_date: 2014-03-04 21:04:39
Good. So you are saying that greenaddress wallet service is 100% secure from theft of bitcoins by hackers?
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:24:36
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:42:10
It's a disadvantage.

How do I know if someone accepted my bits that I sent to a twitter user? Will I receive any notification?

Anyone knows how to extract the private keys to other wallet? Which wallets accept import abra private key?
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:55:47
Hum, I think you should reevaluate this. I think will be very useful to see which of my twitter folllowers/following has Mobi app account.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:25:33
Do you think in implement options to create multisignature hosted wallets like what greenbits does, ex: 2of2?
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:23:29
What are the next plans for Mobi?
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:57:36
Why? I would like to see USD value in tx history of old transactions too. Any chance?
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:17:03
I would like to know why 2 dollars/month for the card. I think makes more sense if it's 2 dollars, but only in the months users use the card. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:36:50
I asked it because mobi support, when I had a bad experience with conversion, answered this: we found the root cause. We got a rule in place:
"User's which convert more than (or an equivalent of) 1000 USD within 24h are subject to a fee of 1%."
So this doesn't apply anymore?
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:29:42
Do you have information of how many people have Mobi app installed in Android and IOS? if yes, could you share?
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:33:29
What do you think about an option to add more than one wallet of the same currency? So I could categorize my money, like (bitcoin to food, bitcoin to travel, bitcoin to...)
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:12:18
It it possible to know which contacts that I follow or is following me on twitter use Mobi? If not, why?
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:31:02
What is on Mobi product roadmap?
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:11:26
I would like to know if, in near future, we will be able to send bits  to other social apps contacts too, like Telegram, E-mail...
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:30:22
It was fixed.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:22:56
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:13:55
I would like to know if you are working in a feature to be able to send bits directly from a tweet, like: send 20 bits to  
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:24:24
Do you think in implement a shopping option on mobi app? I think makes sense list open bazaar products , so inside the app I could buy or sell products for bitcoins. Instead of wallets /mobi/me, should be: wallets/mobi/shopping. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:33:58
What happens if the twitter user do not install mobi? Will I receive the bits back? if yes, in how many days.
And if the user install Mobi, will the user who sent the bits be notified?
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:07:25
Hi, I like Mobi app a lot, but always when I try to send bits using Twitter I get this error: send tweet or DM failed, please retry. (-100801)
Obs: I'm using the last version of Mobi app.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:18:33
I can't see version 3.9.7 on Google playstore yet. Anyway, thanks for supporting lightning. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:43:26
Do you know any wallet that accept import abra private keys? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:28:33
One thing that I like on Coinbase app is the charts, so I can compare bitcoin price with USD dollar. I think it's something that Mobi could clone. Could be something that list fiat currencies price compared to btc. One ex that I like is what this sites does:  
I can see how much % the price of fiat currencies gain or lose compared to USD
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:36:30
On Mobi, can I convert between currencies as many times I want, without paying any fee or worst exchange?
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:16:36
If I buy the card, will you give me a virtual card until I receive the physical card?
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:56:40
Great you listen Mobi users.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:20:42

Hi greatwolf,
I asked about the card to Mobi support and the answer was this:
Good day and thank you for patiently waiting for our feedback.
The Visa card will be deactivated after 7 days of not successfully deducting the monthly fee.
Thus, once deactivated and soon as you decide to use the Mobi Visa Card again, to reactivate, you need to pay only the previous fee before it was deactivated. 
This way, users will not be tied up on monthly fees that are not necessary according to their needs.
Should you have further concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us again anytime.
Thank you very much and have a nice day!
@_date: 2019-12-24 04:42:09

In the past I hated the greenaddress color. But this new version of the mobile app is beautiful. I like the mix of green, pink and black. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:50:48
My experience was: I bought bitcoin on bitsquare, but I did some mistake when transfering the money to seller account. So, to correct it, the transfer just could be completed on next day. I wanted to comunicate him about it, but I was unable, because I was not able to chat with him. Bitsquare accept 3 days (Brazil bank national transfer), before the transaction goes to disput. But I think it's too much. I think should have an option to decrease this time. Maybe he wanted the money at that time, and I was only able to transfer on next day. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:29:48
Do you think rebrand greenaddress? All this green colors is not good to my eyes.

I totally agree with you Jan. Are you bitcoinspinner developer, right?
I think a bitcoin plugin for osmand will be great. A plugin that is able to add/edit/filter places that accept bitcoin, directly on openstreetmap, from osmand app.
It's my suggestion

@_date: 2013-02-26 00:58:53
Hi, I like the idea, but I think you should use  to add the places location/information.
I had requested this for blockchain.info, see the posts:
1- 
2- 
What do you think?
I think the places informations should be added/requested directly to openstreetmap, that is a free source for any use.
