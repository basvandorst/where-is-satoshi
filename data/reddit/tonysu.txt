Bitcoin is not fiat, it’s backed by valuable electricity, and you can always go to your local electricity exchange to redeem your bitcoins for valuable jars of electricity.

I would measure the economy by the net amount of trade. Historically populations are sustained by active trading, there is strong correlation between life expectancy and GDP. Growing economies correlate with population growth, shrinking economies correlate with population shrinkage (I shouldn't need to point out the implication).


That's actually what deflationary means in terms of currency, that the currency becomes more valuable relative to the weighted average cost of goods and services.


So reduced trade, spending and investments, or in other words: shrinkage of the economy.

The rich people can. The poor people can't, so the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. The Winklevoss Twins own at least 1% of all bitcoin that'll ever exist, 2 people own 1% of all total wealth in this system you're dreaming of. There's simply no way for it to work out well.

In the real world rich people that spend all their money on lambos instead of investing don’t stay rich. In the real world a deflationary currency means either the economy shrinks or rich people can get richer without investing, which leads to the economy shrinking anyway.

Yep, they literally described exactly what a bubble looks like and thought it was a sign there was no bubble. Ironically people being that clueless about what a bubble looks like is another sign of a bubble.
