This is for people with money on Gox, not bitcoins .You can take the risk to gamble with Gox insolvency and buy every bitcoin you want in there. Then you'll have to wait for a very very very long time to have a chance to withdraw your money (only 1 transfer per account every 20 days) or you can make a nice profit with (almost) no risk and get your money out of Gox.
You can stay fiat on Gox but you won't get any profit and your money is trapped. Not the best option.

Goodman obtained his email from a company he bought model trains from. If we could find the shop then it would be easy to reach the dude without having his adress, we just ask them to mail him for a gift card available in the shop.
Does anyone know the shop ? Goodman knows.

That's not a suprise, nobody would have been selling coins on mtgox for 100$ or less if they didn't think that it was safer to own fiat for that exact particular case. Everyone seemed to agree about that.

Bitcoin is too high, people want to forget about mtgox and move on, I can understand that, but if mtgox is not sold to some rich compagny that can afford to refund everyone, then we won't forget that fast the lost of 750kBTC.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:18:06
There are people behind the lost bitcoins and they still have a hope, that Google decides to buy mtgox or some kind of childish naive dream.

I think MtGox was a ponzi scheme from the moment they discovered the truth about the thief, they should have stopped everything and  reported the thief to the authorities for investigation, at this time it was maybe just bad luck, but it turned very ugly when they decided to keep accepting fiat deposits as they knew they were insolvent. They were paying withdraws with new comers money until too many people ask for their money and the truth became impossible to hide.
For that reason I think Karpelès will end up in jail for a long time. He could have done things right, a thief can happen, but he has been doing exactly what a ponzi scheme is.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:44:54
there's no doubt Karpeles will go in jail soon

@_date: 2014-02-28 23:29:48
But they paid withdraws with new customers deposits while they had no bitcoin, that's a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:18:25
But that fact was already known when MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection. This is a damn ponzi, aren't ponzi illegal in Japan ? Karpeles shoud be in jail and MtGox should be definitely dead.

The guys asks us to don't ask questions to the staff... how funny is that ? "Trust us and don't ask questions". WHERE'S THE MONEY LEBOWSKI !?
And the bitcoin goes up, higher than it was when gox was still alive.
Well, sure, there's no problem and it will probably be to 1000 before week-end.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:34:18
that would explain why problems started when bitcoin was pretty high, they went out of money.

No, it came out like 20 minutes BEFORE gox halt trading. The bitcoin on GOX fell from 170 to 100 in minutes (with a rebound to 135), then everything stopped.
The site went down  maybe 15 minutes after that.
It looks like they stopped trading just after the leak, so it looks pretty obvious that both facts are connected. And this is bad, really bad.
But according to the message on their homepage, it looks like they found someone to buy the company so customers may be very likely refunded by the new owner (remember Pokerstars acquiring Full Tilt Poker).

I'm not sure the court will accept to refund bitcoins before fiat. Why would they ? If they don't how do they sell them ?
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:05:38
They mix customers funds with their funds, then waste that money on a stupid plan with no chance to succeed.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:45:22
Go on bitcoinbuilder.com if you have bitcoins and an account on MtGox (if you don't already have an account I think it's possible to hold your coins on bitcoinbuilder while you open it on gox ... I mean, if Gox comes back), you can still buy Gox BTC there. It's like 1 bitcoin for 10 Gox bitcoins

People talk to each other. In business we usually say that a satisfied customer talks about his experience to 3 people, an unsatisfied customer talks to 11 people, what about an angry one... a devastated one ?
We all know what happens is not bitcoin's fault, but honestly it doesn't make any difference when someone tells his MtGox story to anyone, he will give people a negative opinion about bitcoin.
Bitcoin just went above 600$ on Bitstamp so you can think MtGox is over and everyone is going to move on but honestly, in my personnal opinion (and I wish I'm wrong) this is just the begining of the mess.

I was trying to sell on bitstamp for hours before MtGox stops working and the price was 20-40$ below btc-e (usually bitstamp is 10-20$ higher than btc-e). Whales were selling mountains of bitcoins. Why on bitstamp ? Why selling so fast ?
I still believe MtGox was shut down because of the twobitidiot leaked document (I don't blame him for that), but this massive sell looks suspicious to me. Maybe they were twobitidiot's friends, I don't know.

I guess the fall on Gox, bitcoin going below 100$, was really unexpected so people did with what they had at the moment. It's still interesting but it won't last.
Few days ago arbitrage on bitcoinbuilder was totally different, when bitcoin on Gox was 80% of average market you couldn't sell your Gox bitcoin for more than 70% real bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-21 14:27:54
You're not trading your Gox bitcoins for money, you're trading them for "real" bitcoins. These guys may not have the money to buy on Gox but they have coins and they do it for more coins.
How long does it take to sell bitcoins, withdraw money on your bank account, deposit on Gox then buy bitcoins there ? This is the point.

I'm not convinced, Karpeles says that Silkroadmarket.org was registered by a customer through his company Kalyhost and it could be true as he was the first one to accept bitcoin as payment.
He also says that nobody asked him informations about the owner of the domain, and I believe it.
And how could it explain bitcoins lost on MtGox ? Karpeles lost 650k when FBI seized only 30k from Silk Road.

Take a look at their trading volume, the site is almost dead. Their plan to recover was stupid, no trading = no money.
This is free market, the market regulates itself and that's what it did. They failed, they died.
