I was creating a transaction from my bitcoin savings cold storage, and that's how I messed up the fee.

I was creating a transaction from my bitcoin savings cold storage, and I messed up the fee. I don't have a lot of bitcoins and that $140 is a lot to me.

Exactly, there are no incentives for normal users to run a full node.

When converting from BTC to Satoshis, I left the trailing zeros in...

Arc bit supports stealth addresses  Recovery seems pretty fast. So do they have a 24/7 node running and checking for stealth balance?

I would not use gliph. Never trust a encryption app that is not open source. Plus they use SSL which can't be trust because if the NSA have the SSL key, their encryption is pointless. They should be using OTR messaging instead of SSL which offers deniable encryption.

No one in America can really own property. Everyone rents it from the government.

I think Mike Hearn is mistaken when he said the agent is not owned by anyone and that it owns itself. Whoever makes the agent to begin with, owns it and therefore retains the profit that the agent makes. So there are definitely incentives for people to make an autonomous agent.

Yeah, even if you create a successful autonomous entrepreneur, you would retain some it profits just like an investor would. Can you imagine?
Step 1: Create a successful autonomous entrepreneur.
Step 2: Profit.
You can retire now because you are set for life, meanwhile society benefits from your agent's constant innovations!
