And still you call them a scam in every social media you can find? Ridiculous. 
If I'm not mistaken, it says when you place your order that it will be processed within one [**working day**](
Go cry wolf somewhere else. I bet you've been heard crying in a lot of places before, and more to come.

I have a raspberry pi and a system to monitor payments, I don't really care about the possible double spending, so doing _something_ when I see a transfer get in is not a problem. I just don't really have an idea of how to send the signal for the machine to deliver the coke.
Then I guess I can have a tablet displaying a QR-code with the updated price. Would be nice to have a static QR-code, but I guess I will have to make my own wallet for it to request a dynamic price (plus bitcoin address) for that to work.

I'll post here and PM you when/if I get somewhere with it. Would be a really fun project. And we (my company) can't be a bitcoin company with a coca cola vending machine in our office without it beeing able to accept bitcoins as payment. How would we be able to continue look ourselves in the mirror in the mornings :)

Thanks, I'm going to look in to that one. Allthough for this case I'm not so worried of double spendings since the machine is in my office. But the paper looks interesting

I have one coca cola that I'm allowed to tinker with, and also one of these:  . With the coffee machine you atm need a RFID-tag with points on for it to distribute a coffee capsule. Would be epic to make that one also spit them out for bitcoins!
