No.  Btc is aol off the 90s. Great,  until literally any other variant came out. Will the price continue to rise? Sure it will,  will it Ever amount to anything but a store off value? Not while omg, and literally hundreds of alts do a better job.

 To be honest,  I just feel like btc is a really popular Savings account, and for good reason.  But if that money went to new stuff,  we would be further along.
