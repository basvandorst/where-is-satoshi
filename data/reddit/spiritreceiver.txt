I'd say that there is no middleman who can decide if you may donate to WikiLeaks or not, for example. You still have to pay for the infrastructure (via mining fees). But it doesn't seem clear which one will be cheaper in the end.

Well, is there a "global tax reporting standard"?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:24:17
You don't have to use that slider in Electrum. There is a way to enter the fee manually. Maybe you must enable that in the options first, I don't remember.

The authenticator is not tied to your phone number but to a secret code that was stored on your phone only. To recover it, you'd need the secret/barcode that you used to set up the authenticator. If that's not available to you any more, you'll probably have to restore the wallet from the seed as explained here:

@_date: 2015-12-19 20:24:26
Thanks, the page also shows some "cost of conversion" at the bottom, I didn't see that before.
The difference in the account indeed seems to coincide with the difference between their mid and ask price as shown on the website. Presumably, a similar fee applies when money is sent from the account, as it incurs another "exchange".
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:28:30
You can't currently register for Coinbase in Germany. I'd suggest kraken.com or bitcoin.de, if the recipient is willing to go through the identity verification for this purpose. bitcoin.de uses Postident, i.e. you go to your nearest post office and show your ID.
Of course, there's always the risk of price fluctuations. I also think the price at bitcoin.de tends to be a little below that of more liquid exchanges, you can have a look at bitcoinaverage.com to get an idea.

I found the installation of both Electrum and the Trezor plugin on Linux a little difficult due to dependencies. Maybe the user interface could also use a little more work.

Andreas Schildbach's wallet has the option to sweep a paper wallet in the menu.
Regarding password protection: You're probably not supposed to use the wallet for larger amounts but rather for everyday purposes. For this, I wouldn't want another password. My phone is protected already, and my fiat wallet doesn't have a password either.
I'd still prefer if the wallet didn't reuse addresses, and I think this is planned for a future release.

It seems that you are using the terms wallet and address/key almost interchangeably. A wallet typically contains many addresses. Note that it is good practice to use a new address for each transaction, and this is what most wallets do by default, I I think. Paper "wallets", however, only include a single address.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:45:47
Yep, and it only works once ;)

That's probably a little too optimistic. I read about it in the beginning of 2012 and wanted to find out how it works. So I bought a little. I still think it is a marvelous technical concept and ideally will end up as the cash of Internet. With the two greatest advantages of being independent of central control like governments, and allowing money transfer that does not rely on monolithic companies that charge too much for a simple task and/or have too much control over our cash flows. For these two reasons alone, it is important to have an alternative to the existing infrastructure.
Now, it's great to see increasing adoption over time. But I wouldn't expect a major, sustainable price increase in the near future. There's far too much uncertainty. And I guess that five years ago, nobody would have expected the price to be anywhere near USD 300 in 2030, not to mention 2014. I'm still glad that I'm part of the experiment and curious to see where it goes.

Wow, that's interesting. Apparently, transaction times without using "MasterCard Send" depend on the size of the payment. Makes me wonder how those transactions work today. Didn't they realise that digital information can be distributed pretty quickly, irrespective of the content?

There are many wallets where you are in control of the private keys and you don't have to download the blockchain. Electrum and Multibit are probably the most popular ones.

The options probably haven't changed very much since last year. Coinbase.com works from Germany now (but not the exchange), but localbitcoins.com doesn't operate in Germany any more. I use bitcoin.de and kraken.com.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:57:41
Still sounds like a good idea, I think. People could collect several deposits in a single address, then revoke the address and empty it, which probably wouldn't count as address reuse as there's only a single payment from that address. Might also make sense for fundraisers, for example.
Wouldn't it be possible to have an address included in a PGP certificate? The infrastructure to have these revoked already exists, and it's free. But the process of creating/checking the certificates would have to be included in a wallet and its contact list.
Edit: Also, namecoin might be an option, and [Bitcoin Authenticator]( is working on Onename integration. But you still wouldn't register all your addresses (and have them associated with your name, of course).

That's correct. But I also noticed that Fidor is particularly quick. It only takes minutes until the funds show up in the Kraken account.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:29:02
Right, but that could be done with mytrezor.com as well, and it is the reason why the addresses are always shown on Trezor's screen when signing.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:59:07
But then it's called "technical analysis".
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:52:00

They are wrong here: "One the one hand, this freedom prevents corrupt governments from tampering with its value; the darker flip side, however, appears when something goes wrong and there is no one to turn to and no one to be held accountable..."

The result of a transaction are unique transaction outputs (at least one). Only these transaction outputs can be spent in future transactions.
The blockchain contains the history of all transactions. I.e. it can be used to reconstruct the current set of unspent transaction outputs. In case of double-spending, the creator tries to spend an output that has been spent already in another transaction, and that's how the double spend is identified.

Most wallets can probably do this.  For example Electrum and Mycelium can, I think. Look out for the feature called a "watch only" wallet.

As with any other currency calculations, I assume that the system internally uses integer calculations for the smallest denomination only. Floating point numbers should only be used for convenience in the user interface.

No, the bitcoins won't go anywhere. They should just be shown by the original wallet again if the spending transaction doesn't confirm, as if nothing had happened.
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:13:07
Unless you know what you're doing, it's probably better to wait. I don't know which wallet software you're using, but check if it has an option to "refresh" the wallet or something like that.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:58:44
Don't return it on the basis of the address only. Anyone can look up the amount on the block chain and find the address. Instead, ask the sender to sign a message with the secret key.

That's not how they'll secure the network. They will just make contracts and restrict access to the consortium. There is no need to  waste the energy if they can control the access anyway.

Great. Making a "news article" from a Reddit post, then posting that article on Reddit.

The network doesn't just reject transactions like that. It is purely an issue with that exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:11:52
tradeblock.com still knows about your unconfirmed transaction: 
But the fees are low, and if it doesn't confirm, the transaction will indeed disappear after some time. You should be able to resend it then.

@_date: 2019-10-17 08:02:10
That's how hardware wallets work.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:42:49
Almost. They won't "transfer back" because a transaction didn't happen in the first place. At some point, your wallet software should realise that there's still this unspent transaction output, and you should be able to spend it like any other again.
Just don't think of the network as a collection of accounts with balances, but as the history of all confirmed transactions, as this is what is stored on the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:10:09
This must be a joke, right?
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:24:21
Of course you can! This is what you do when you install a node on a device that doesn't have so much computational power.
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:57:06
You can run Electrum Personal Server on the node and use the hardware wallet with Electrum to connect to the node.
Setting up a node is described here:

Also, the documentation is very clear that you'll lose your money if you publish old channel states. This probably falls in the 'not done any research' category.

"We successfully tested the movement of money between a client account and a JPMorgan account using the new technology,"
Wow! Who would have thought that a blockchain can be used for something like that.
@_date: 2019-10-17 08:04:46
You still need to know the unspent transaction outputs to create the transaction, the private key isn't enough.
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:23:31
I find that the explanation lacks detail.

You can also use Trezor with Mycelium on Android if the phone supports USB OTG.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:19:48
Typically, a wallet creates two outputs. One of the addresses is the address that you wanted to send bitcoin to. The other one is the change address. It belongs to your own wallet, so the change goes right back to you. That's because the input transactions can only be spent completely, not in fractions.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:51:11
Maybe, if that's what you wanted to say...

The term "actual currency" doesn't make much sense here.

I work the other way round. A few people know that I have some. Only if someone asks, I explain a little, typically when Bitcoin was in the news again. Just enough to spur their curiosity. When they stop asking, my mouth is shut, and you can see them thinking in those moments of silence.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:35:38
But they can also turn it off if they don't want you to pay for something. As in WikiLeaks or backpage.

The phrase only contains the information which addresses belong to your wallet and how the content can be spent. The actual amount of BTC associated with those addresses is stored publicly on the blockchain, so it can be accessed by any client that knows your passphrase.

Your phone has the chance of getting infected with malware, and when it goes online, your private keys may be gone. And you may want to go online to spend some of your coins.
With a hardware wallet, on the other hand, it should be impossible to retrieve the private keys. Even if it's used with an infected computer.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:58:04

You shouldn't enforce using a single address only.
Kraken's approach is much better, in my opinion. The user can define a set of withdrawal addresses and lock these settings. Unlocking them again takes several days, and the user is notified via email when unlocking is initiated, so there's some time to react. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:32:04
You can use Electrum directly with the Trezor device. Or Mycelium (Android). 
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:48:40
It seems that it doesn't. And I totally agree with the developer here.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:09:04
I think you can transmit a raw transaction using Bitcoin Core from the command line/the debug console, even without syncing first. You'll find some instructions here:

Now that poor Nakamoto guy is even called an alien.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:20:27
No, they certainly don't. IBANs are permanent, the exchanges rely on a specific reference text in the remittance order to identify their client. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:33:12
I think you missed the point why the blockchain is needed in the first place. Since a new block must only include transaction outputs that are unspent, you need to know which transactions were confirmed already. That's why you need to know the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:42:23
While it certainly may be a little difficult to get them, bitcoin should probably be compared to other currencies rather than vacuum cleaners.

Right, "arbitrage opportunity" for the guy that maintains that website. Is that you?
@_date: 2016-02-21 09:05:36
I doubt that they pay anything at all, that makes it an arbitrage opportunity.
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:03:16
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:41:30
That's still a no-go. Virtually nobody reads those policies, and hiding in there that they are going to "pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes" is just unacceptable for a site that handles personal financial data.

@_date: 2016-02-20 22:27:36
What kind of scam is this?
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:22:31
Probably because Mycelium considers the different address types to belong to the same wallet, whereas the other wallets don't.
Using a change address of the same type as the other output increases privacy, because the external address is not immediately recognizable. I think that Samourai works the same way. You should be more careful with your accusations.
@_date: 2016-09-12 18:24:36

Presumably, most people that hold a noteworthy amount of bitcoin show up here one way or the other. Let's say that accounts for 50% of all bitcoin, or 16,615,475/2=8,307,737.5 according to coinmarketcap.

I was about to have a look at them, but they won't let me register with a spamgourmet.com email address.
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:19:18
Was 0.004 the amount that you wanted to send? The rest is your change, it goes straight back to a new address in your own wallet.
Basically, with bitcoin the amount that comes from a single transaction must be spent at once. So your wallet splits the transaction output in two chunks and one of them is sent back to you.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:21:14
"Movement of Concerned Citizens" - What a ridiculous name.

Yes, it is. They cooperate with kraken.com and bitcoin.de in Germany.

Yes, I do. And I verified my German bank account with them. But new registrations may not be possible any more...

Mycelium works. And if everything fails, you can still use  to derive the private keys from the seed. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 09:32:18
Having small differences is not surprising. Only above a certain threshold it would be profitable to make opposing trades on different exchanges which can reduce the gap.
Also, there's probably additional effort involved for a BTC seller on localbitcoins.com, so one would expect a higher price there. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:32:57
No, it is not. According to the current figures, buy 1 BTC for EUR 213.24, then buy GBP 163.12 (~ EUR 219) with bitcoin. However, for most of the exchanges in UK, bitcoinaverage.com even shows prices above localbitcoins.com, that's what I find strange.

Looks like we need a decentralised postal service.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:00:19
It is not clear what you mean by "ahead of time". With BIP32, a (virtually) infinite number of addresses is generated from a single seed, so they're all generated ahead of time. Have a look at   and  for more information. This is probably implemented with many of the lightweight wallets nowadays, so you'll only need the master key to derive all the addresses in a wallet.

There we have it! Did she recently get new shoes or anything like that?
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:45:24
Certainly not lost. Try using Electrum with Trezor.
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:36:31
While Electrum shows a new address for each transaction by default, the previous addresses remain perfectly valid. There should be no issue at all.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:05:36
Probably not. I'd assume that it's related to your network connection, maybe that peer to peer connection is throttled somehow? But I have no idea.

Transferring from EUR to GBP via bitcoin may in fact be a good idea. Have a look at [bitcoinaverage.com]( My understanding is that bitcoin tends to be a little more expensive in UK than in continental Europe. You'll also see on that site which exchanges those quotes come from, e.g.  .

Is this the modern version of Schrödinger's cat?
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:16:48
Should work with Electrum:
After importing the wallet, in the Addresses tab you can right click a specific address to spend from. In the Spend tab you can then remove the outputs that you don't want.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:55:14
It is good practice to use a new address for each transaction, and those addresses all belong to the same wallet. Without additional information, nobody knows if those addresses belong to the same wallet.
But Electrum relies on a server in the background, so in principle the server would be able to connect those addresses. Have a look at the "Console" tab in Electrum. You'll see which server you're currently connected to.

Yes, that's normal and even preferable for security/privacy reasons. Mycelium is a HD wallet and thus will provide a new address for each transaction. Previous transactions were performed with addresses that are not shown again.

Note that Electrum apparently follows a different approach:

There's been some kind of malleability attack on the network for about a day, see

If you get one bitcoin now, you'll own 1/21,000,000 of the overall amount that will be available now and in the future. If you get one Dollar and the central bank later decides to double the amount of money in circulation, your share will effectively be halved. This is called inflation. You see the difference?

It is not from the hash:

We do not agree.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:55:44
The fees are, by construction, the difference between the inputs and the outputs for all transactions included in a block.

OK, thank you for the information. So, the mechanics are different from what I thought. But is there an issue with how it is currently working? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:08:28
If shorts panicked, they'd close their positions and buy bitcoin, not sell.
@_date: 2015-10-09 06:46:11
Even if done with a computer, that's still market making. The point is that someone promises to buy and sell and to offer prices for a certain volume.
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:26:19
But we can elaborate on the idea. Like putting the alarm clock two meters away from the bed and having it burn bitcoin continuously as long as it isn't turned off properly.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:47:07
If that's an issue, you can just give some of your bitcoin away to fellow redditors to level it out again.

Yes. very alarming indeed. There's an orange rectangle on your screen.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:52:20
Green transactions are incoming, red ones outgoing. That's why the amounts have opposite signs.

If 1NYvs1QbKg4FbRaF6d8NqiYg55mayZPcS9 and JxBbeNbNCCaWnCbxpFvkyPsQ4pDJKf83E are the addresses that you have the private keys for, the incoming transactions look just fine. The addresses received about BTC 0.223 or USD 100 (as of now).
But the transactions were confirmed on 3 and 5 May already, so "just received two payments" doesn't make much sense. Something appears to be wrong here.
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:41:51
Wouldn't Coinbase work?

So, I guess you like whisky as well?
@_date: 2015-10-03 23:11:20
Probably related to this topic:
If you check the transactions on a block explorer, you'll see that both transactions spend the same inputs. That means that the unconfirmed transaction will be considered invalid and never gets confirmed, just as your transaction that moved the bitcoin further on. Both should just vanish at some point, or maybe you can refresh your wallets to that they show the correct balance.
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:32:03
You're absolutely correct.
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:23:50
We found the culprit!
@_date: 2015-10-02 10:01:55
This wasn't Mycelium, but probably related to this:
There's nothing you can (or need to) do about it. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:07:56
You can also use this site (offline) to calculate the addresses/keys from a seed:

You can also see on blockchain.info that 8218e7821939421302084e6ae9d64960f1e11f03cd2f1e1c3c98a2079416dee2 uses fcd06b91d4572dca5b36f3f634694db036f80c2f27c079797f7379ad348a8f00 as an input, they're not independent. That's probably why 821... ist not yet confirmed.
You could try to use a wallet that lets you construct transactions from specific inputs, I think that Bitcoin Core and Electrum let you do that. But it may stilll not be clear that a new transaction will be propagated and confirmed first. Better just wait.

Which would literally mean that 3% are already planning to ditch it again between year one and year three.

It can be estimated from the difficulty and how long it takes until new blocks are found.
The difficulty is set so that, on average, one block should be found every ten minutes. From this, one can estimate how many hashes are calculated in the entire network.

No. If all the dice in the world (number unknown) are thrown simultaneously, and as a result you know that 1 is thrown 10 million times, your estimate for the number of dice would be 60 million. This estimate includes the dice that didn't throw a 1.

There are a few now.

I even registered. Not sure if I'm qualified to contribute anything, but I'm running a node and I hope that it'll be fun anyway.
