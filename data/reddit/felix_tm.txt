It's a matter of security mostly for users. It helps to avoid haphazard orders.
For example you've got $5,000 on your single account and accidentally made an order to buy 1 BTC for $5,000 instead of $500. It will be executed immediately. Transaction is irreversible so you lose all your money.
But if you have 2 accounts, you fund trading with $500 and you have no opportunity to make a mistake.
All the major exchanges and brokers support 2 accounts.
