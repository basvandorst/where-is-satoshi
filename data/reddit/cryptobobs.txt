Joe Rogan Experience. Only the best podcast of all time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:33:39
If it aint on Gdax then it aint real!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:48
Thank you for clearing this up
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:36
fear, uncertainty and doubt, usually evoked intentionally in order to put a competitor at a disadvantage.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:16
Has this turned into everyone begging for bitcoin? Dont be so greedy folks. All these real comments are great suggestions though :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:54:03
Crypto Cousins, Bad Crypto, Joe rogan podcasts with Andreas, and many more!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:17
From where?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:05
Just keep hodling. Next week we'll all be happy again.
if were all not dead and broke
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:23:16
No worries it most likely sent! Your address changes after every transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:28:38
This is the real question. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:21:53
Sell the psp and just buy bitcoin. If it were able to mine you would just lose money and your psp would most likely blow up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:47
So if they pull out were all screwed basically? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:34:17
Yes, Ltc is super fast for transfers also
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:44:14
I doubt it. It may have one more dip but I would be suprised if it dropped passed 8.5k again
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:55:24
I think your fudged on this one. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:18
This needs to be one of the first things one learns when starting out in bitcoin. I see far too many posts on high fees due to coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:22:48
Crypto Cousins is good one. Its on spotify and itunes
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:23:18
That 1 million dollar dog better be worth it

Someday this photograph will be over in r/historyporn showing how a cup of lemonade in 2017 could buy a HoverTesla in 2074

As far as I can tell it's just a massive public shaming. The FCC vote doesnt occur until December 14th and even then it's poised to move to the court of appeals, not the Senate.
So yeah just buy off Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:12:12
Everyone please sell all your Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:42:59
First time hearing Andreas curse. Jeez la weeez
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:01:24

One lucky man..
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:37:09
well done! This is hilarious 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:18:18
This post is literally the definition.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:05:42
Blockfolio is a great app for that! It lets you enter all your cryptocurrency and tracks them for you without actually depositing them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:44:16
My parents made me sleep in the shed last night.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:27:04
It will hit 15k by the 10th then drop down to about 12k again for a bit.

This is great

Takes me about 3 to 6 hours for me to transfer funds from Gdax to Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:31:10
Teslas only!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:34:33
He makes most of his money from refers with his fans. Any youtuber pushing BitConnect On his fans is a scammer in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:39:29
I bet that hack yesterday fucked so many over
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:56:14
Did you write this OP?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:32:35
Bank transfers take up to 7 days. If you pay with a credit or debit card it is instant. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:26
Someone please disprove this. Its got me worried
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:07:34
Do not use bitcoin.com

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:38:56

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:46:40

Invest in a quality fleshlight and tempurpedic pillow.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:58:19

@_date: 2018-02-25 04:54:22
