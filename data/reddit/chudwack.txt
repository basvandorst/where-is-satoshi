adding more zeros after the 8 that exist now would not affect the total  supply of btc.  Instead of the current 0.00000001 as the smallest denomination it would be 0.000000001 if an extra digit was added. Its just a way of breaking a unit down further.

Until you consider any gains you would have made by holding the bitcoins you spent.

Im with this one.  If you're account was hacked for the second time its likely you have a keylogger or otherwise malicious software monitoring your computer.

Gyft sells gamestop gift cards which can then be used to buy steam cash cards.

Bitcoin is not going to be very profitable mining on 60 cpu's.  Maybe 4 years ago, but not today.

doesn't sound like an issue with gyft, but rather with burger king.

I bought two of these for about $35 in total over the past few days.  I'm extremely bummed now as this was a gateway to other giftcards and a whole range of daily necessities like gas and food.

Cryptsy has been a blessing to a lot of people in the crypto world.  They've made me very wealthy.  THat said, the latest update and increase in user accounts has really slowed the site down.  Getting refunds from canceled orders can sometimes be lagged for some time.  Support has generally been helpful, but I'm assuming they're pretty swamped with tickets. 
Cryptsy should NOT be considered a scam as I have deposits and withdrawals and go through daily without issue.  Cryptsy should be considered a work in progress and issues will arise.  Cryptsy has way more to gain by keeping the exchange up and running.
Further, the guy running the site, Vern, is open about his identity and will be quite easy to go after if they do decide to cut and run.  But I think that it is more likely to happen on smaller exchanges than what Vern has built in the past 6 months.

How long would it then take for someone to bet big on their opponent and throw the game?

you sent extra because the market had a crash?  Would you have asked for coins back if it had gone up in price instead?

Thanks, very helpful!  I must have overlooked it somewhere.

Just because you leave a job does not necessarily mean you were inadequate at it.  Only that you left.
