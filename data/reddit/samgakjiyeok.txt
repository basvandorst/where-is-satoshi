This is a good point and why I think even if BTC was 1000x faster and cheaper than Visa, no one would use it.   Why would you ever spend BTC over fiat? People tend to hoard deflationary hard assets.

90% + of all alts go to near zero. So why try to guess which alt will moon? BTC can reasonable go 10-20x from this point forward and thats a conservative estimate.  Its a safer bet

I agree but the last point is a bit of a stretch.  Govt is too incompetent. Remember Obama Care launch? They couldnt  even get the website to work. Lol.  'In a dystopian future where there are cameras in every room, I doubt half of them would even work' - Harry Brown

Not sure what is worse : To never have invested in bitcoin. Or to have sold all your bitcoin at $700 and becoming a nocoiner.

sounds tempting but wouldn't surprise me when coinbase freezes your account.

Buy both. Trezor integretes nicely with myetherwallet thus supporting all ERC20 tokens (ledger can't do that). Ledger supports stratis and some other coins that trezor doesnt have
