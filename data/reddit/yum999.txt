I am very sad that has become what it is, people accepts only positive facts and ignore negative facts, calling them FUD.
I appreciate your thread, not in a position to discuss it in a technical way right now but I think this is the kind of threads that I would love to have on technical threads discussing about something real instead of memes and delusional threads :)...
GL and keep going!
P.S. before anybody reply me in a bad manner, I think BCH is shit, both the community and the shit they've done, and the way that the implementation is handled doesn't give me any reason to prefer it to Bitcoin (but bitcoin shouldn't be a religion)

Interesting. 
They could also increase the block size and add a maximum fee, to let the miners have about the same fee per block there they get right now.
