Well they locked me out of my account, and I would like to verify my identity to get access again, but alas, their recovery process is trash and customer service sucks ass
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:38:36
Is this legit? LOL
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:50:42
No we only buy high and sell low

Satoshi moved on to slinging dope and smoking crack
@_date: 2019-11-30 03:34:47
Thank you for taking me back to Step 1. You are so helpful, dear friend. May Satoshi bless your soul

You’ll be waiting a lifetime for $3,300 to come. I don’t think it’s gonna happen. Only reason we went that down before was because of BSV.

I had a Camry and that shit was not reliable at all. It’s like every single month something went wrong. First some water pump broke, then the alternator, then the radiator broke down, etc. 
Ultimately I “lost” the car in a total loss accident. Really that was a win tbh. I took the money that the insurance paid me for the value of the car, and got a better vehicle

Get a room, you two

I guess he means like “showing” 21 million coins, by name, but realistically there being more, hidden. 
In any case the code is open source, so anything is verifiable tbh

I remember watching videos about a place that would use less land to pay less taxes, and so they would build up into the air, and make tall houses.

I have the ruby red card from them. I’ve also participated in their crypto earn thing and have gotten awarded. I think they’re pretty legit. Although I’d just use a cold wallet like ledger’s to store long term
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:32:51

Just make sure it’s actually Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Diamond or whatever
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:38:29
I’d like to see his trade analysis
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:00:16
Does it have KYC?
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:34:43
So long as it’s under $1,000,000, any price is good

Futures might be the first of many things that Bakkt can do. Later on they can offer more to the Bitcoin environment, or even the environment of other cryptos.
Institutional investors might feel more comfortable with something with Intercontinental Exchange in its name rather than whatever Chinese-hustle exchange name you can think of.
To me, it adds credibility more than anything. It should also give investors a sense of security knowing that there’s big power behind this, more than just some dudes coding in their basement.

Bitcoin isn’t a hedge against losing your job and going broke. If a recession happens people will have to cash out to pay bills
@_date: 2019-12-10 05:58:13
People (or bots) will ask you to send them 1 BTC, and they send you 2 back. It’s a scam

That’s a red flag.

Looks like a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:35:52
The best strategy is to just DCA when it best suits you. I don’t think it’s wise to go all in at a certain point, when you can buy in cheaper later

Don’t send your 1 BTC for 2 BTC

It was first viewed by my friends as a thing for terrorists. Something “illegal”. Now when I bring it up they just say it’s “risky”.
I think people are starting to slowly accept Bitcoin as an investment piece, albeit not stable. I’m curious to see how this changes with time.

I picture an environment where people get paid in Bitcoin similar to a hyperinflation scenario. Only instead of people rushing out to spend their money because the price of goods fluctuate by the minute, it’s their paycheck itself that fluctuates.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:25:11
Also pay down debts
