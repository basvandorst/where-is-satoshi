Wirex is the new E-Coin. The app and new platform will be ready soon. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 10:15:38
We are in the process of rebranding. You can get a card through  with either a plastic or virtual card. The cards automatically become Wirex cards once the platform moves over. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:45:11
The exact date is not yet determined. The new platform is in beta now. The Wirex app will be in the app stores soon and will work with E-Coin accounts. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:57:58
We use BitGo multi sig wallets. They are also insured by the XL Group. Fiat is secured by our banking partner.

Not all of the site has been updated yet. You can see fees on the card page  You can see more info on our E-Coin page.

You can choose which you prefer to hold your money in. You can load your card with fiat or leave it as bitcoin. You can convert it to fiat and load your card, and you can also take your money on your card and buy bitcoin with it. So basically its the best of both worlds. Wirex is the first 2-way card where you can buy and sell (use bitcoin).... So to answer your question if you have 1 bitcoin in your Wirex account(BitGo wallet) and you leave it as bitcoin it will stay as bitcoin. If you load your card and convert it to fiat then its fiat. The difference with our system is you can also convert the fiat back to bitcoin.

Hello Bitcoin_Forever. Nice to see you again on here. The more options for bitcoin users the better. We feel we make bitcoin more user friendly and thus more adopted. Bitcoin is a best P2P but at the moment its not widely enough accepted.

Hello. "Scam" is a negative and especially false word to use when talking about us. Wirex is a serious business, run  by financial professionals who understand how to build financial products based on Bitcoin. We appreciated your emancipative sentiment, as We love Bitcoin just as you do and we understand just how many things Bitcoin does better than traditional banking. But right now, in the present, **Bitcoin is not mainstream**. People **need to know options** to reach bitcoin, options that help them use it with what they call "real money", in the systems they are accustomed to. And that's what Wirex is all about: Giving more options so people can drive their money by themselves.

Then Wirex is a great solution for you. Good to have you onboard!

I hope you do not have an issue with one of the Wirex founders because he is from Russia? Dmitry Lazarichez is a very accomplished and professional financial professional. Dmitry is one of the top professionals helping bitcoin become more legitimate. 
Wirex is a registered company in London and has been at the forefront of bitcoin adoption. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:45:31
Yes, exactly. That's what everybody saids the first time they read Mister Forever
@_date: 2016-07-21 19:35:53
Hello! Wirex has an excellent alternative to combine both blockchain architecture with traditional Banking options. Also, Our first Visa Card is free if you request it through the app. Go check it out ;)

Hello! Yes, While you have balance on your Card, our baking partner applies the 1$ fee per month. If you have no balance on your card there are no fees.
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:40:22
I think you are, again, mistaken Mister Forever. E-Coin and Wirex are the same. Both platforms are working and our more than 130 thousand clients in more than 140 countries proved We are neither a scam nor defunct. Maybe you need to settle down your extremist views and let the people who is truly working to made the bitcoin mainstream work in peace

If looking to get a free card in USA. Register with an address in a region we support. You will be unable to verify your account to raise limits, but you will be able to redeem and use a card with a lifetime limit of $2500.

Actually, That's not true and a little baseless. Wirex is run by financial professionals who understand how to build financial products, and we have been working with the bitcoin community for a while with the idea of pushing the bitcoin into mainstream. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:37:59
Hello friend. Sadly, at the moment you can't use the virtual card at physical locations, as it is only for use online
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:52:29
You mean on our tutorials? Yes we do. That's why We blur them
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:44:12
Actually, that's not truth... Wirex is a brand form Wirex limited, a Fintech startup based on London, England, and founded by Pavel Matveev on 2014
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:59:45
Well, Actually Our Virtual Visa can be linked to Paypal. So what yoy said may be possible. But on samsung pay or android pay, they are not accepted yet
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:41:35
You could be able to redeem a virtual debit card in USA, but you are unable to verify your account. You would be able to have a $2500 lifetime limit on your card until Wirex moves officially into USA and users can verify their cards.

The technology is not as known as some people would believe. The idea is to create a bridge that creates real transitions from regular banking to bitcoins. We all know they are tons of thingd bitcoin does better than banking, and It is important to point out this thing and combine them with the classical bank systems and help the general public know more about digital currency. Everyone need the opportunity to learn more, don't you think?
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:46:15
Eh, not really. But hey! You are entittled to your own opinion. But try not to spread baseless rumors
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:12:17
Hello friend. You are being a bit inaccurate in your comment. We do not have ghost fees, we do not charge anything more or less to our clients than what this links reveals:
