It generates a wallet for you which you can then move the bitcoins out of.

That's terrifying.

Which is precisely why "Anyone can make a bot" is a dumb argument.

According to you, it costs 100 EUR.

In the context of this comment thread, it was used to refute the initial comment.

I'm starting to feel like it's going to be easy for any business which takes bitcoin to simply plug their advertisement here.
If I cared about wooden puzzles, or followed this business, I'd have found out myself...
I don't want to know about every little thing which takes bitcoin.

That's a really silly argument, not everyone has the means to produce a reddit bot, and it doesn't invalidate criticisms.

A bot identical to this one. How much would that cost?
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:22:46


I understand that. The point is that while the price may be fair as it is the cost needed to maintain the feature and extra load on the bot, "there must be a better way" (as the original comment puts it), because the price doesn't exactly line up with the gain. The issue isn't with some kind of absurd profits, or that there are no competing bots, it's merely the cost to tip someone reddit-wide.
(It isn't even an 'issue' necessarily, this comment thread simply stems from that observation.)

How much?
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:31:58
While I'm unsure, I believe the bot holds onto your bitcoins and keeps track that has X BTC, then will send them to you once you provide it your wallet info.

The point is that being able to give folks BTC in any subreddit isn't much of an incentive for a $13 donation. It's very simple to send someone a tip from a supported subreddit, for folks who don't donate, it just means that you can't send it in a reply to their comment.
I'm not arguing that the bot shouldn't need donations, nor is but the point stands that reddit-wide support isn't a strong incentive for that price.
The whole "do it yourself" argument is ridiculous, because for the reasons you stated specifically (programming, capital, maintenance), it is difficult to do. That doesn't mean the perk is actually worth the $13 it costs, though. You should check out [this post on thought-terminating clichés]( which was on recently, because you're using one right now.
Edit: Adjusting wording.

I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm saying it's a ridiculous solution to offer when someone points out that it's a little silly to pay $13 for added convenience in tipping folks.
I sincerely doubt suggested competing bots as a real, viable solution to this, it was a statement meant to shut down what I consider to be a valid point, that $13 is a silly price for what it offers.
It's not that anyone here thinks the price is unfair (for the bot needs money to run), or that there *is* an easier way to do it, it's just the simple point that $13 is quite a bit for what can be performed easily in a PM.
