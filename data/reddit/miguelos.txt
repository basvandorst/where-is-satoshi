Hi, I made the app.
Do you have issues with both Coinbase and Blockchain?
I wish I could support 2FA, but that's a limitation of their APIs.
Microsoft is unfortunately stopping me from updating the app.

Sure, I'll provide a proof sometimes in the next Two Weeks™.
One a more serious note, and as you might already expect, I don't have access to a proof at the moment. I'll see what I can do about it, but I'm not sure it would be worth the trouble, if a proof can be obtained at all.
I encourage people with similar stories to share them here with us, as that's probably the best way to validate the above claim and help us understand what is happening.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:26:22

Although Bitcoin for Windows Phone is a third-party app, it's somewhat "endorsed" by Coinbase. You can see it there: 
I wish I could update the app, but I had trouble with Microsoft certification process earlier this year. I'll probably have to remove Blockchain support if I update the app.
Give it a try, and let me know if you have any issue.

There's some stigma around the Microsoft and Windows branding. Yes, people think it's "uncool".
I heard that people that sell phones (at AT&amp;T and Verizon) usually are not familiar with Windows Phone, and simply never recommend them to people.
As much as people like to think that they're "different", they want to own the same phones as everybody else. As a general rule, people that can afford it get an iPhone, and others get an Android phone.
Most people don't even know that "Windows Phone" exists. And I would bet that most people that do think that it's some clunky "Windows Mobile" device with the stylus and Start menu. It is not.
Windows Phone is technically on par or superior to other smartphone OS. It's all a marketing issue. Sadly, I believe people are missing out on a great mobile OS (I don't know any honest people that did not like Windows Phone).

Oh, I'm not saying that the technologies used in Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies) won't help the Internet get better. I'm sure they will.
However, saying that "Bitcoin" (as a whole), which *is* just a system managing some currency, can be *bigger* than the more general platform that let people communicate anything is silly.
Can Bitcoin help the Internet become *bigger* (I'm not even sure what it means in that context) than it currently is? Of course. Can Bitcoin become *bigger* than the Internet? No.
Saying "its got the potential to be bigger than the Internet" is uncalled for and pretty much a lie.

1. I totally agree.
2. I'm actually doing research, and I would love to get paid for it. However, I'm not. I guess research is the "big risk" part of free market. Also, nothing stops people from donating to research. I want more research, but at the same time I'm not sure I want them to be funded by the coercion which is taxation.
3. This is the obvious solution, but I'm still not convinced it's the best. The old leftist top-down part of me thinks it is, but I have the feeling it's not.
4. Sure. Scams can still be dealt with independently, I guess.
5. Just give earth the same rights you give to humans. No need to create and enforce specific laws for earth. Make pollution illegal indirectly.
6. Again, I think donations should fund them.
7. Extremely complex issue. I'm still not sure about it.
8. Yes.
9. I honestly don't have any opinion on this matter.
Income tax? No. Tax lands and resources.

Show me recent examples of "Microsoft's abysmal handling of security". I don't believe that they're any worse than other OSes. If anything, that's only a side-effect of openeness, which you can also see in Android.
I would personally be much more comfortable "storing my money" (it's all on Coinbase in the above example anyway) on my Windows Phone device than on an Android device, simply because one is less open, and therefore more secure than the other.
As for Windows 8, it's not that different from Windows Phone. "Modern" apps running on Windows 8 are completely different from regular x86 apps running on the Windows "Desktop". They're probably just as secure as mobile apps.
I'm not saying that Microsoft is perfect, no one is. But the Microsoft hate is too often taken for granted, and mostly based on nothing but perception and a massive circlejerk.

This is much better. The analogy I use (which I understand is not perfect) is Bingo.
1. Everyone is in a large bingo room.
2. If you want to earn money, you can play bingo.
3. Players can get as many bingo cards as they want. The faster they are, the more cards they can play with.
4. Each bingo player also has a transaction notepad on the side, which he fills with all the transactions he hears from other people in the room. The more transaction he adds to it, the more money he gets (as most transaction include a fee which goes directly to the winning bingo player).
5. Each transaction notepad starts with a transaction of 25 BTC to the current player. 
6. For each transaction a bingo player hears, he adds two entries to his transaction notepad. One from the sender to the receiver with the specified amount, and one to the sender to himself (the bingo player writing these), with the transaction amount specified. For example, if John sends 1 BTC to Bob and pay a 0.001 BTC transaction fee, Tony (a bingo player) would write "John -(1 BTC)-&gt; Bob" and "John -(0.001 BTC)-&gt; Tony)".
7. Before adding a new transaction to his list, a bingo player must check on the "main board" (which contains the list of all transaction that ever occured) if the person's balance is equal or greater than the amount sent. If it's not, the transaction is invalid and ignored.
8. Anyone in the room (playing bingo or not) can send money to someone by saying out loud "I send X amount to Y person, and I give Z amount to the first bingo winner that lists the current transaction (aka transaction fee)".
9. Bingo players keep filling their bingo cards and the transaction list until someone says "Bingo!".
10. People verify if the win is legit. If everything is in order, the winner can pin his transaction list to the "main board", which holds all transactions that ever occured.
11. The difficulty of the game is adjusted so that a person wins in average every 10 minutes. Initially, a simple straight line could be required to win. As more and more people start to play, it may be required to complete two lines, or to fill the card completely (or to fill 2 cards, etc).
1. The next bingo game starts, and the cycle goes on.

The app basically let you generate "cards" that goes into your Windows Phone Wallet (which is part of the OS). In the wallet, you can have many different cards such as your Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Coinbase and Blockchain cards.
Windows Phone let you protect the wallet with a 4-digit PIN, which you have to input every time you want to see the cards.
Basically, yes. You can PIN-protect your Bitcoin wallets.
That said, there currently is a bug (in my app, not the OS) that allow people to go straight to the "send money" page without going through the PIN-protected wallet, effectively making the PIN useless. This is caused by the Bitcoin URI scheme support. In 99% of the cases, the current implementation protects your money if your device gets lost/stolen.
I will fix this in the next release.

After a while, you might encounter a problem refreshing/making transactions with your Coinbase "card". This is because Coinbase asks for tokens to be refreshed quite often, and this is problematic when the app runs in the background. There's no risk for you, you will simply get an error message when trying to make a payment, if the issue ever happen. In that case, you'll have to delete and recreate the card. I'm doing everything I can to try to fix this small issue for good.
Blockchain doesn't seem to have the same issue.

It's not less safe than any Apple product, your ISP, gaming consoles, etc. Heck, even the open nature of Android make it an easy target for viruses and trojans.
Don't listen to everything you hear online/in the news. You most likely only hear one side of the story. It's easy to hate Microsoft and Windows, but reality is that they create very nice products and people don't give them the credit they deserve.

I prefer this:
    
    min_order_btc = 0.1 * total_btc
If you have 100 BTC, the minimum amount you can trade is 10 BTC. 
If you have 1 BTC, the minimum amount you can trade is 0.01 BTC.
The 0.01 multiplier can change, based on lag or other factors.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:41:01
Would be much better to drop the value of a bitcoin by a factor of 1000 and make everyone have 1000 times more bitcoin. Unfortunately, that requires technical changes, and might cause more trouble than anything. Unless the change only occurs on the presentation layer.

I don't think they have bad intentions. They're just protecting themselves in the case they have to close (they give 6 months for people to get their money out). I think it's reasonable.
And if  and  contradict each other, then the whole contract is nil and they can get away with your money.
@_date: 2013-08-23 05:22:46
No, you were actually correct.
While I have absolutely no malicious intent (be it tracking, stealing, phishing), it's likely that other people have. Also, nothing proves that I'm not actually one of them.
The fact that my identity is relatively public might help with the trust factor, but it's still not a guarantee.
That said, I could be the most honest and well-intented person, but my application could still have hidden bugs and flaws that could potentially lead to financial loss.

It is assumed that everyone owns an equal share of all the lands. If someone wants land exclusivity, he has to pay dividends to everyone. Everyone can then use this money to voluntarily fund what they need (roads, health, defense, etc). In some Geolibertarianist models, a part of all rents goes to a central government who deals with a few core issues (such as defense, roads, justice).
Basically, the only time you *must* financially contribute to society is when you want to rent lands and resources.
I'm not an expert, though. I still need to learn more about it.

I would think they can make it much cheaper. The credit card infrastructure is huge, wasteful and expensive. Processing payments online (on a local server) costs almost nothing.

They use the same tools/interfaces other apps use to be useful, but they have their own definition of useful.The damage that a malicious app can perform on a platform such as iOS and Windows Phone is quite limited, because they're not really open (in term of API, not source code).

Thanks for the advice. I already know everything about this, and feel like Blockchain.info is the perfect mix of practical and secure. I prefer this over other online wallets (such as Coinbase) because it's a "true" wallet, which I can recover with any Bitcoin wallet. I keep a paper wallet of my Blockchain wallet, just in case.
But you're right. Going local would be a notch safer.

If they did not do it, they could be stuck 10 years later with money that no one is claiming, and have no right to do anything with it.

I made some research. Anonymous shipping is hard.
I found two "startups" that promised to made this happen. But I'm skeptical. They're all in BETA, and don't share much details about their methods.
The more I look at it, the more I realize that it's a real problem. Many people would use something like that.
The obvious solution would be to simply communicate your address publicly, so that people can ship things to you. But it most people probably wouldn't be comfortable with this. On top of that, it would be a chore to manually input someone's address every time you want to ship something. We need a one-click solution.
There's also the problem of black-mailing. Also, who will pay custom fees, or additional shipping charges?
I can't imagine a future where I can't send you a pack of beef jerky in a few click, without having to ask for your consent.

I will release the source code soon. That said, the source code wouldn't solve that particular problem, as there's no way to prove that the app in the store runs the provided source code.
At this point, the only thing people can do is trust me, or simply not use the app. I recommend people to put between $5 and $20 on it, if they don't want to take too much risk. My identity is public, if that helps with the trust issue.
I have nothing but good intentions. Still, use at your own risk. You never know.

Wasn't that bad.
Even if it was, I think that bad press doesn't hurt bitcoins. Being told by the media means that people will blame them when it's going to get mainstream. Blaming other people instead of themselves will contribute to the acceptance of bitcoin. If they were told bitcoins were perfect and still decided not to buyt hem, they would be mad after themselves, and wish for bitcoin to fail.

We should get rid of "coin" altogether.
Coin means:


That's what makes people so confused about Bitcoins. They think it's physical in some way, they think it's undivisable, they think it's exists somewhere. They think that the Bitcoins themselves can be stored on a flash drive, they don't know that only the keys are.
A coin is an old metaphor, and it's time to get rid of it. It's just as silly (if not more) as using a floppy disk as the "save" icon.
We should coin a new term that's more aligned with the ledger-like nature of Bitcoin.
But I agree with the use of the metric system (even though 10 is an arbitrary number).

If you can hash/sign an app and verify that it hasn't changed after installing it on your device, then I guess that works. But most of the time (except maybe for Android), this is not a possibility. This can't be done on iPhone, for example.
The other option is to encrypt your messages locally using an app that has no internet access, and then paste the encrypted message in a communication application that doesn't need to be trusted. But that's not practical, and people will end up not using it.
Personally, I don't believe in privacy, and don't see the need to encrypt most things. But that's a whole other debate.

Windows Phone is technically just as good as Android and iOS. Its design is also way more elegant and consistent than on either OSes. It's the mobile OS that provides the best experience out there.
Why hate Windows Phone when you don't know anything about it? That sounds pretty close-minded.

You're kidding right?
Windows Phone apps are not clunky, they're simple and elegant. I'm not sure what you mean by clunky...
As for [that specific app]( it's indeed pretty barebone. Still, it does the basic stuff:
- Add Coinbase/Blockchain "cards" to your WP8 wallet (pairing).
- Private key (or paper wallet) import.
- Receive money.
- View transactions.
- Spend money.
- QR code scanning.
- Bitcoin URI support.
- Contact book integration.
- Firstbits autocompletion.
Coming soon:
- Coinmap integration (show nearby places accepting bitcoin).
- Live tile (show current price of any market/currency).
- Currency selection.
- MtGox/Bitstamp/VirtEx/Coinbase trading.
- Push notification.
- Market price/graph visualization.

What's the difference between a "monopolistic corporation" and a "government"? There's none, really.
There are many solutions to this problem.
Road builders might be forced to offer a free "off-road" alternative to roads (no maintenance required).
We could also take the Geolibertarian approach, where road builders must first rent the land to the society. Since it is assumed that every person own an equal share of all the resources/land, everyone gets paid an equal amount. They can then use this money to use the road, or keep it for something else.
We might also exploit the Y-axis, forcing roads to be built underground/above ground, so that people can circulate "freely" at ground level.
Just use your imagination.

It seems like they did not use https before, that's right.
As for the pairing, I believe the QR code simply is a string containing the username and password in clear text. They're then stored on the device, and used by the app to query the API.
I think they added a pin to encrypt/decrypt the locally stored username/password (so that other applications can't read them).
I myself built the Blockchain.info app for Windows Phone. I hope their changes doesn't break it.

Blockchain's API work on the server side. You do have to send the credentials with every request, and they claim that they do not store them, but they still do the work on their server. My Windows Phone client only send commands and credentials to Blockchain's API, which does the rest.

1. I don't have much time to work on the WP8 version.
2. The WP8 version is missing many features, and require some bug fixes.
3. Porting the app to WP7 require quite some work.
4. I'm not sure if WP7 supports the Windows Phone wallet (on which the app relies).
5. Maintaining 2 versions of the app makes everything more complicated.
I don't really make any money with this app (I made maybe $7), and the WP7/Bitcoin niche is very small. It just doesn't make sense for me to spend 10+ hours making a WP7 that will be used by less than 100 users just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
I know how you feel. I used to own a WP7 device, and hated WP8 only apps. But you have to understand that in the case of this app, it's just not worth the trouble.
If my job was to do this full-time, and that I was paid to do it, I'd be glad to make it, even if it was just for you. But unfortunately, it's not the case.

I'll try to make that clearer in the next update. Thanks.

I'll read a bit more about thin clients (SPV). Not all .NET/Silverlight libraries work on Windows Phone (most don't), but I guess it's always better than nothing. However, I'm not sure I'll undertake such a huge project (not before being sure Microsoft will accept it it least).
For now, I'll just try to make the current app worth using, and then I'll see if there's potential for a more complete app.
Thanks for the luck :)

- Learn what money is
- Learn why Bitcoin is better/different (technically and economically)
- Learn how the Bitcoin network work (public key crypto, mining, distributed ledger)
- Learn how to use them (wallets, echanges, places that accept them)

I agree. I'm not looking for the perfect theorical system. I'm looking for a practical solution to this particular problem. And yes, it will involve additional steps.


I don't think there's any problem with a "debt system", and instant transactions are overrated anyway. Actually, the Blockchain is a ledger, which is pretty much debt-based. A currency always has this feature anyway. The only difference between regular "debt" and "currency" has to do with trust. In the first case, you must trust someone to pay his debt. In the second, you must trust the currency system. The latter is often (but not always) much more trustworthy. A trustworthy person with a debt has just as much value as a trustworthy currency that is accepted and has value.
Ripple only decentralizes trust in a more personal way. I think it's a good compromise, as it allows to trade pretty much anything "instantly".
Ripple is technically simpler than Bitcoin. I think that Ripple is much easier to understand and explain than Bitcoin. It's about people lending money to others, that's it. However, the whole Ripple network is harder to visualize/imagine than Bitcoin, which enforces some "central" uniformity.
Ripple is MUCH more versatile and flexible than Bitcoin. It's just such a better model. My only concern is with their particular implementation (slightly too centralized). But the concept is, in my opinion, much more elegant than Bitcoin. Consensus is what I dislike the most about Bitcoin, but I guess it's probably a necessary evil.

I'll first make sure the app works as intented. When it does, I'll see what I can do about that. But I think it's a good idea, and I probably don't have much to lose by doing so.

Maybe I should have made the instructions more explicit.
All my app does is generate a "card" and add it to the native WP8 wallet, which comes with every Windows Phone (that's where you store tickets, boarding passes, credit card, PayPal account, etc).
Once that's done, you must launch the Wallet app (not the Bitcoin app), select a card (or an account), and then you can receive money, view transactions, and click "open app" to launch the payment interface interface of that particular card/account.
After pairing your account, you never have to open my app directly again. You simply use the WP8 Wallet like you would for any other payment services.
I tried to integrate as deeply as possible with the native UI, but I overlooked the fact that it might confuse some people.

No, but it's the only OS where you can integrate Bitcoin to the native wallet.

The app problem is not that bad on Windows Phone. I mean, most of what you would expect is there.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:43:06
Looks like you are right. My app is just as unsafe as 99% of non-Bitcoin apps, and as safe as the Coinbase app.As you know, web wallets are a often a tradeoff (Blockchain.info being semi-included), and they bring convenience in exchange for less security. My mobile web wallet client is exactly that, a tradeoff.There currently is not any other Bitcoin wallet available on Windows Phone. I built this for myself, and thought some other people would have a use for it. I offer this app for free, as is, without any implied warranty. I can't possibly afford to build a fully-featured standalone Bitcoin client, and thought that using the API of services people already trust to a degree would be enough.Anyone who doesn't trust Blockchain probably shouldn't trust me.

If more is better, than surely using 100000 different website is better than 10 no?
Don't you think you use to many services? Don't you think you use too many apps? Don't you think that it's painful to create an account on all these websites?
When you think about it, 90% of services you use daily share the same mechanics/workflow. Why not create a single interface that let you communicate anything?
There really is no need for all these disconnected services. Heck, I could split Facebook into 10 different websites that do only one thing. But nobody would use them, because they like services to converge.
And no, it won't be like the portal thing AOL did.

Developer of [Bitcoin for Windows Phone]( here.
I'm well aware of the decimal point bug. I tested payment with lots of keyboards and languages, and everything appeared to work fine (with both "." and ","). Unfortunately, the issue comes from the regional settings, which I did not test.
I submitted an update (fixing the issue and others) last Thursday. It should be available next week.
In the meantime, you can change the regional settings to English (US). It should work fine.
Good luck with your lost Bitcoins!
**EDIT:** I'm currently trying to see if this could be a bug with the wallet. I can't see how it could be the case, but I'm still looking at every possible scenarios. If in doubt, I'll have to pull the app as I can't afford this kind of liability. I'm sincerely worried.

I'm currently redesigning the entire app.
I would love your feedback. Do you think you could give more specific suggestion/criticism?
I can understand that the app lacks features. But I can't see how the UI for current features could be improved. I mean, do you want me to add chrome and textures and crap to make the app look more complex? Do you simply want to see more information? If so, what?
Most of the UI of my app is actually made by Microsoft themselves. My app integrates with the native Windows Phone 8 wallet (which is what you see in most screenshots). If you don't like the design of my app, that's fine. But you also have to admit that you dislike the design of Windows Phone in general (which my app pretty much emulates).
Now, I don't have any problem with criticism. I actually request it. I'd love to hear what you think should be added to the app to make it more functional/beautiful (which to me are the same things). I'll even send you early screenshots if you want.
Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in doing.

Because I can't seem to translate my ideas to reality. I've been looking for a partner that would help me do this for years.
Basically, you start with a huge knowledge base that is flexible enough to accomodate anything you would need in a virtual reality (mirror of the world). Then, you fill it with real-world data (facts about the world, people, items, rules, etc). At this point, you have a more or less complete "snapshot" of reality.
Then, you manipulate the model to communicate your intent. Basically, you make changes to the virtual reality to communicate the elements of a contract. Once that's done, all you need is to let the system match complementing contracts/tasks together. Then, both (or more) parties agree to the terms, and the semantic tasks are added to their todo list. The last step is to execute the change that occured in the virtual reality back into the real world.
All with a WoT and support for multiple conflicting realities.
Now that I think about it, my description is probably very confusing and vague. I should write a manifesto or something.
