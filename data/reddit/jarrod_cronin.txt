A credible Source on the tradingview platform said Friday that if the 3600 resistance breakout happens that Bitcoin will go to 4300 in less than 2 days. We still have all of Sunday to reach 4300

I think that's a bit too low for the correction. I thought it was going back down to 1902 2500 myself last week but now that it's up to 3800 of course I do remember the drop three weeks ago that went down to 1900 I constantly do research and graphs I really think it won't go below 3400 ever again

How can you take advantage of the Arbitrage if you live in the United States because while getting around the restrictions of using OKcoin.com in the US with a VPN there is no way to get cash out of OKcoin.com  so if you sell for 200 more than you bought it for how do you take that out in Bitcoin you'll be buying back into Bitcoin at the inflated price.

Thank you for taking the time to enlighten people I wish this article would spread as I have seen the same technique on Poloniex with 50 to 400 btc and could not understand what was going on.

I am in Boston.  I know that if you want to start a platform like coinbase it with an online wallet aka holding peoples money you will need upwards of 50 million dollars to be registered as a money transmitter in every state that I required which is almost every state. So not just being registered with FinCEN but having state by state Msb licenses. If you're still interested in doing it without providing an online wallet service such as like bitquick.co that is easier and you wont be holding customers money in an online wallet.  I wanted to start a platform like bitquick my background is in IT and marketing. I have access to a 50k domain name to do this as well but I do not have programming capabilities things like getting net verify by jumio setup. If you'd like to speak more about this please let me know it might be interesting to team up on this.

Trade back into Bitcoin, time lock for 180 days into bitconnect.co  do not sell your bitconnect coin each day because it will be going up to 300 to 400 in 2 years and you'll have your money back.  
Good luck Sir

Backup your HD wallet from mobile onto a thumb drive store it somewhere safe. Password protect that phone and the mobile wallet. 
I store my offline bitcoin in a bank safety deposit box.
