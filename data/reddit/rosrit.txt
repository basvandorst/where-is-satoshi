Also can we make it verbose so that we see what keys it has processed?

It's possible. Switzerland likes to move fast and silently when it comes to being at the cutting edge. You can buy bitcoin at train stations, funds are starting to take clients who request to have Btc in their portfolio seriously and some cantons are planning to accept part of tax payments in Btc.

I am not sure it is that cpu intensive. Mempool should be stored un the ram most probably also negligible. Do you have any metrics in your bandwidth? How about connection to other nodes? Do you transact with your node?

There are tools to analyse the data in an image to see if it is consistent with the compression. On the other side the tools to encrypt info try to be more efficient and hide that info better. It's a cat and mouse game.

That transparency is really an issue in my eyes too. Although other cryptocurrencies try to solve this issue they are not very successful at it. I am looking at how the masses are tracking the wannacry funds at the moment. They cannot hide nor seem able to cash out.

That is a very good answer. Also I would like to add that bigger blocks means we will need more powerfull computers and more bandwidth.

What is holding you back if you haven't? (regulations, uncertainty...)

It's good that the network is tested now rather than later. Let's see how Btc holds up. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:48:52
Usually Its a proof of address such as a bill and an official ID, passport or even driving licence.

Not at all. They are 2 different coins with a similar name. I am surprised nobody forked earlier. The lower price will bring more people in the ecosphere. BCH and BTC existing and competing is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:04:02
And who are you? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:08:52
Bitstamp through simplex. You get double kyc and high fees, about 10%. But it's convenient 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:27:25
My guess is institutional money testing the waters. Pour a lot in and then pull back. Study our reaction and then take a decision. We are an experiment. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:37:34
My bad, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:51:15

I agree, it's not normal all this money pouring in. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:55:29
That's very good. Are you the original artist? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:18:16
If they are really clever they would implement Segwit and then maybe dynamic block size. raspberry pi can work and 20k computer can work. This kills the bitcoin classic. Let's see. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:50:07
I have a feeling that there will not be decentralisation nor trustlesness. Let's see what it is when they announce it. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:42:05
All these attacks on bitcoin a good thing. They will test our strength and show the world how resilient and strong we are. Altcoins, forks, regulations, big mouths. Nothing stops the blockchain. Nothing stops bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:30:38
Epic, beats the Apache helicopter anytime
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:33:38
They often do not and a fork happens. After a couple of confirmation the network will follow the longest chain. The blocks from the other chain are orphaned and thrown back in the mempool. It takes less than 6 blocks (confirmation) before everything is back to normal. Can anyone correct if I am wrong somewhere? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:47:08
So comunism? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:12:27

@_date: 2017-08-02 03:22:33
You could maybe buy them normally then change them to monero and then back to Btc in a different address. Maybe that would work. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:55:05
That is a lot of requirement you have. The most fitting although far from perfect is poloniex due to so many trading pair. If you are just getting started then bitstamp might be a gentler place but their API is a bit funny at times.

The answer you are looking for is that bitcoin mining is very unprofitable unless you have very cheap energy and a large operation. You best course of action is to pass by an exchange. I personally use bitstamp. You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin such as 0.01 for 25usd if you wish. Welcome to this wonderful world and ignore the drama for now. (you will love it later)

We all are Satoshi Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:55:24
They are obviously baiting our community and we are taking that bait. We should just ignore it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:04:30
Most of the mining is already there due to cheaper energy and manpower. The problem is not the localisation but collusion as in a mining cartel 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:52:25
There is a lot of trading activity that looks like bot

The guy in the gif? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:52:47
Or they could activate all the miners with next gen chips they have been covertly manufacturing with the money we have been giving them and take over both BCH and BTC 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:05:21
Exactly, maybe OP should use a 1 year price chart rather than intraday. We are at a very good position. We need a bit of sideway to consolidate now.

Note the word blockchain. This is very different from bitcoin in the eyes of a company. Blockchain and bitcoin don't necessarily have to go hand in hand.

@_date: 2017-08-24 14:25:08
I do like this metric but who says they want to own a bitcoin. There are too many hidden whales out there that are manipulating the market and that is dangerous for stability 
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:31:35
What are you basing your predictions on? Genuine curiosity as I think inflation will get out of control but not in such a short time. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:45:35
One of the best article I read about Btc. Satoshi should distribute his wealth equally to all active addresses. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:41:10

not everyone is a seller, it will drive the price of the coin up and give Bitcoin even more power. It will end up being a weapon against the legitimacy of governments. If the FEDs are clever they are working overtime to find a way to kill Bitcoin not give it more power

Very interesting approach. But it fails into taking account of the banks, the buildings and rhe whole infrastructure needed so that we can make that single visa transaction.

Go on an exchange that does live trading. I always recommend bitstamp and see the price there. Different exchanges will have different prices and that is called arbitrage. Also there is no need to spell and bold the numbers, but we do appreciate the effort.

They are studying how to create their own. It goes even further, in the future everything will be tokenised. Your bank currency, your supermarket, even you can create your own "big_ol_dickhead" currency. And they will all be traded against each other and against bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-22 10:13:08
But why would electrum need servers to host a wallet? Surely my private keys are better in my possession rather than in "a cloud" of servers. I could then transmit my transaction through any node I please, wouldn't that be the case? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:03:44
That is very interesting, do you have a link to the official source?

Perfect answer right there.

It's up to the forking chain to implement replay protection. In the meantime make sure you have your private keys and wait for this whole thing to pass
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:02:12
That is scary.. I didn't know it was THAT bad. Surely this will have a negative impact at some point. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:53:59
They are most likely working in their own blockchain and coin. I am sure most banks are working on their own private crypto. I suspect that they will market it as money 2.0

To put it into perspective, after Mt Gox I was completely disgusted with everything blockchain and forgot about it for 3 years. Last month my girlfriend came and simply asked me "have you heard of blockchain, someone mentioned it at work" and it tilted. I Google it and discovered how much we advanced, segwit, altcoins, the dao... All of that under my radar. Me, someone who was obsessed with it a few years ago. So yes, we are still veeeeery early

You mean like singing a transaction with your private key and then passing the signed tx to a friend beyond the firewall to broadcast it to the nodes?

I was under the impression that the nodes relay the transaction and validate the rules while the miners secure the network. Can you correct me where I am wrong?

If it were to happen tomorrow then bitcoin would be very negatively affected, bitcoin is a bit of a luxury good at the moment. but once adoption increases and the barrier of entry are lowered then capital flight will definitely find refuge in bitcoin.

They are not decentralised, they are wallets that allow you to keep control of your private seeds. But you can correct me if I am missing something. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:39:05
wouldn't that have to be done dynamically? I am sure the government will start playing whack a node otherwise. This would render mining useless as the Orphan rate would skyrocket. or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:10:50
They want to sell mining contracts? Is that what all the fuss is about? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:05:41
It is an interesting point of view but I doubt that crypto is that big for nations to be that involved. But it could be possible. North Korea could be secretly trading for commodities in bitcoin. Buy 500btc worth of oil, coal or even prepackaged food with private companies in China or Russia. It would be interesting to Txs linked to that and inspect nodes coming from N Korea 
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:41:57
Does that mean they own ASICs? I wonder who sold them the chips. Is there any way we can find their mining activity or even a node relaying from within their territory? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:38:24
That Is good to hear. Congratulations to you and your friends. It's story like yours that will get people interested in Btc. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:21:37
Yeah the poison of margin has arrived to bitcoin. From what I hear is that it is backed by tether which is apparently back by nothing. All that smells really fishy. The whole structure is holding on a very thin line

@_date: 2017-09-27 15:53:51
If you can have large scale mining operation and special contract with a nearby electricity provider for near free energy them maybe. If you just want to buy 1-2 miners then they will just become expensive radiators. Just buy bitcoin instead 
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:28:48

They have a communist party meeting coming up in mid October. They usually clamp down on many shady things before that meeting. Beijing construction company have stopped, police is increase... A big thing for China at the moment is how to reduce capital flight. They limit the amount of outwards transactions for individuals and companies quite easily BUT for bitcoin and crypto , it is not an easy task. Chinese are buying these coins like mad and sending money in masses to other countries. Once the meeting is over and we see Xi Jinping smiling and praising China everything will slowly go back to its corrupt normalcy. This is my opinion, anyone feels free to correct or add.

You can get your 12 words seed key from your main wallet and once the dust settle import this seed into a bcc compatible wallet and claim them while keeping your Btc intact.

Don't let it consume you. I got in in 2012 and beat myself as to why I didn't know it before when you could mine it with a CPU. Look at where we are today. If you feel frustrated with bitcoin right now I recommend you to lock what you have somewhere safe and forget about them for a while. In a few years, when you come back you will realise how lucky you were and how early you got in. 
Imagine when all your non tech friends will try to get some to pay for their daily expenses. In your mind you will say: "yep, I saw that one coming and got in early" 
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:37:50
It is backed by the underlying concept of decentralisation and democratisation of the currency and the blockchain system. Everyone decides and play a role on whether it has a value or not. It introduce a new idea of value to the table that cannot be linked to Fiat, gold, other assets. It is a natural evolution of currency in the digital age. Same as we used to barter with goods then traded in gold and silver then traded with fiat. We will later trade with digital currency.
