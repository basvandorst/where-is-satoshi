Everyone lies.
You would think that people involved in Bitcoin would understand the risks that are involved with things like trust. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:20:23
... I understand why you would think the collapse needs to be like a big explosion or you wake up and zombies are running around eating everyone for no reason. Most people are desensitized. You need a big slap in the face for you to pay attention to anything.
It looks like anyone predicting the decline of the dollar since 1950 has been right every single day, all day long. 
Read a fucking book

Why the hell are you bringing the protocol in to it? 
People who trust other people with their Bitcoins again and again lose it. 
If someone keeps telling you "Oh yeah, funding is coming. I'll pay you later" you are taking the risk because you agree to keep working. The risk is you trusting that person. Are you dumb and daft?

So what is stopping Mr. Allaire from starting his own coin full of whatever regulations he wants? 
Oh wait, capitalism. No one would adopt that shit coin. God damn I love capitalism.

How did all that FUD work out for you?
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:28:55
Because they don't work for you.
They work for the person running the printing press.

Oh yeah? Who doesn't lie. Bring this person to us and let us bask in their glory.
Apparently fallacy is the new buzz word for millenials when they don't like what they hear. Chock that one up next to 'fair' and 'progressive'

I don't think you have a clue about Bitcoin if you think it is comparable to using another country's currency in the US. 
Actually that's probably the most luddite statement about Bitcoin I've read in a long time. 
Tell me, does someone have to wipe your chin so you don't drool on yourself?
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:07:52
Oh really, like what?

And on the next go around you get to be one of the people who bought when Bitcoin was cheap. Welcome to the roller coaster.
Someday you get to say "Yeah, you're the bag holder..."

Man that was great.
it was like a giant, elegant, middle finger to all the folks who have been crying out to be legislated. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:41:27
Why not just say "to keep the money you earn" and "prevent others from stealing your money without just cause or your consent"
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:38:28
lol lucky few. 
It couldn't possibly have been due to hard work, diligence and confidence in your decisions. 
It's not like we were never in your shoes. The only thing that makes me fear for the future are the sheer number of folks who are so willing to just give up. "You mean I invested $25k and now people expect me to work to protect my investment? Bolderdash!"
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:12:24
Oh yeah, democracy is so great. ::yawn::
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:07:50
I have zero sympathy for folks who work for free because of a promise. Those are the kinds of people who cry "It's not fair" when they make bad decisions. Working for free or for a promise is a bad decision.

I didn't elect shit!
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:26:09
I can't remember when their wasn't vomit loads of speculation. A couple years ago wasn't as bad but I'm not sure where this idea came from that in "the good old days" every one here gave to charity.
I'm here out of self-interest.

I sent Dorian $25. 
I wouldn't feel right spending more on promotion. I would pledge $25 in BTC at the time of donation.

if you're liberty minded this site replaces any need for Facebook btw
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:54:08
Disagree completely.
This is the beginning of the era of competing currency. No one advertises the dollar because men with big guns and bombs make people use it.
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:28:44
I'm confused. 
The only thing I didn't like about him that you mentioned was "lobby the japanese courts"
When you work for a startup their is risk. If you choose to work for free that's your burden. Saying investments are coming and investments being there are completely different things. 
Now... The big problem I have is that you seem to allude that the foundation **is** good for Bitcoin. It most certainly is not.
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:12:43
least bad tax. 
El oh El
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:46:21
Then you probably shouldn't use an **anti-authoritarian** currency.
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:10:11
The ideological basis was around long before. Satoshi's dialogue and message was clearly bringing those ideas to reality in this form - Bitcoin.

After 6 months of waiting they cancel your order?
Fucked up.

Well, they say that.
Statists just want to wipe out all non-statists. They give you a chance to conform but ultimately they want to destroy you.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:35:19
You're right.
Bitcoin is a control. It's the honey badger. People are the variables here. Bitcoin will keep getting better and its competition will continue to get worse.
We finally have the ability to bet against the government. It's as good a sure thing as there has ever been.
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:27:30
Because bitching on reddit is the epitomy of uselessness.
If you are sick of the hash rate getting consolidated go out and fucking do something about it. 
I don't have a solution. Doing the "Oh nos!" thing on boards is even more useless.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:10:04
And that's why they employ men with funny costumes, shiny badges and guns.
They're going to ask the shit out of you.

If the price goes low enough you effectively can.

If it's true it shouldn't be refutable. 
Total cop out.

You're talking about the free market.
Essentially saying, let's go full circle and get back to the point where the user's who have individual interests get to determine for themselves what level of risk is acceptable for them. If an actor is irrational or hurting the consumer then that actor will be hard pressed to find consumers willing to patronize them.
I am all for markets. I am all for a return to markets.

Good luck proving someone owned a number guaranteed by the heat death of the universe to be unique for the whole entire 15 seconds it was used before being destroyed
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:52:44
This is very much not true.
Just because you can track where coins are sent means absolutely nothing for linking a human beings identity with who controls the wallet.
Is someone paying you to spread misinformation?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:04:53
The dollar will become hyper inflated and people will instantly convert it to another currency and only use it to wait until the last minute to pay government bill's that require dollars.
It will become useless. Bitcoin is the end of the nation state
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:07:37
You know we can just shift the decimal right...
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:08:42
Dude you are talking about tracking fiat by matching your **EXCHANGE ACCOUNT** up to the **WITHDRAW TO YOUR BANK** from your **EXCHANGE ACCOUNT**
Holy fuck dude you are talking about the realm of fiat. At any point in this conversation did anyone make mention of fiat because I'm pretty sure everyone has been saying bitcoin.
I don't care, it does not matter and it is completely irrelevant to Bitcoin that people can be tracked through exchanges. You are trying to attribute the exchange process to the bitcoin payment system. Exchanges have nothing to do with the payment system. They're just built on top of them.
You're saying "Because the developers who made my video coded it poorly and it crashes my operating system sucks."
I'm telling you I can generate a keypair. Have people send bitcoins to my public key and spend and use those bitcoins as freely as I want, forever and ever and ever and no one will ever be able to figure out who I am.
You're pointing to a physical flaw. The fact that businesses can be seized by force and their property taken from them. Then using that stolen property the thieves can ascertain who addresses belong to by matching order shipment addresses to keys used in transactions. 
I don't know how many other ways to break it down for you. Regardless, you're incredibly naive and exorbitantly unimaginative if you think the exchanges are the only ways of turning bitcoin in to fiat. As if fiat will matter for anything other than paying bills in 20 years.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:38:54
That's the biggest endorsement I could get.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:51:16
No.
