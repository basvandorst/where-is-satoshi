They do in my city

Crypto is where email was in 1995. Hardly anyone used it. Give it a few years. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 00:01:44
I think your wrong. I went to post secondary in 1995 and we never had email.

Mass adoption starts one person at a time.

Local Bitcoin atm is best option. Can't buy with Coinbase anymore. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:34:20
There are more Bitcoin ATM's in my city now (800,000 people) than there are bank branches. Growing all the time.....when the dam bursts, it will burst quickly and adoption will be quick.

Where in Canada are you?
@_date: 2019-02-01 01:48:56
It was good while it lasted. Stay local from now on. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:29:32
No. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:15:47
True! I still have high hopes for my NYAN coin though. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:21:51
Bitcoin is the Coca-cola....they were there first. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:34:45
Now is the time to start educating the kids about crypto. I can't wait for the next crash from 100K to 10K. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:34:45
Mine too. Many stores will accept it now. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:55:37
You know, 10 years ago all the old people whined about Facebook. Now they are all on it. My FB friends list average age is 55 years old. My relatives all laugh at crypto, but in 10 years they will all have crypto wallets and will be using them. My thing is all about
teaching the next generation ...... 
@_date: 2019-02-02 06:37:47
You know, go fuck yourself. Some people had buy orders in on cryptopia. Some people tried to BUY crypto from Quadriga and in good faith sent them money and they never sent the BTC. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:12:06
Laughed out loud when I read that
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:40:13
I have closed all but one bank account. Pretty much don't need it at this point. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 03:57:48
I am thinking of moving out there.....how are real estate prices where you are? I had enough of -40
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:29:20
Next one is NYAN. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:27:55
Still early, we are only a few feet off the bottom now and rising 
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:28:41
Damn rights. Now is the time, sell when the hype is back and it pumps a couple thousand in a month
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:27:11
They will all pile in when it hits 20K
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:42:35
Shakepay if you are in Canada is ok, or PM me if not
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:18:55
Hiroshima and Nagasaki was nothing compared to what they did to Tokyo
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:14:35
Crypto for sure....Bitcoin, more than likely not. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:55:36
I can send you paypal for crypto if interested. Need about $1100 USD worth 
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:50:50
But American can do no wrong, they are always right and everyone else is wrong...don't you know?
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:25:02
What a tool you are, really. Get an education. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:01:10
After the cryptopia hack, I have lost money several times. I love the crypto space, but it is time to change my focus. I am going to help educate people one person at a time and I encourage you to do the same. Cryptopia delisted my favorite coin, NYAN (unjustly I may add) so I created 
Time to spread the word. Teaching a group of 4-H members about crypto next week, all will receive a NYAN and DOGE paper wallet with 100 coins each with their own private keys. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:39:33
I call total BS. When they say they are on the "verge" of a "discovery", they haven't discovered it. Meaning they have nothing. You either have it or you don't. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:24:20
When they won that money from CIBC and tried to cash the bank draft at BMO, BMO refused to accept it. Faster we get rid of banks the better
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:27:12
You need to get a grip and learn what happened. All played out in the courts, they are a honest company, I deal with them DAILY.
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:53:26
You got to get in early. I adopted a coin that has been around called NYAN. 
For more info about NYAN, we you can find it on TradeSatoshi (  ) and info at 
We are a small community, a few of us are working on a mobile wallet right now and also I promote it with kids (
It is really a crypto that needed some love....it is a POW coin that is 5 years old and just has some volunteers running it...no formal leadership, it isn't some pump and dump token. Watch for some exciting growth with it, we are doing a 100,000 flyers in my city shortly to take about the coin and crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:40:08
Welcome, it is a good feeling! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 19:08:00
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:54:57
Correct answer
@_date: 2019-01-23 05:26:14
I always use paper wallets. That way I never have to worry
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:49:48
I agree. In America (and other Western countries) people believe whatever they are told. Maduro was elected, and they have a solid system. American's don't like him, make his life hard, sanctions starve the people and American's fund the opposition and try to create a civil war for the oil. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:45:25
Soon there will be laws that make that the ONLY way to store your bitcoin legally. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:55:17
I am hoping that can be NYAN one day....I paid 500 NYAN to my buddy the other day for coffee.

Why would I need a company to do this when I can print out a paper wallet and do it myself in 30 seconds?
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:54:09
Angry much? 
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:54:12
Nyancoin .....trust me on this. Dirt cheap right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:55:07
I love when family laughs about it. Got in around $900. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:24:26
I will be laughing all the way up. I am buying each week.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:19:10
Thought I was in r/mgtow for a second
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:37:08
Was thinking about this the other day. It would be great to have a crypto alternative to paypal that can protect buyers.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:40:30
Clearly, not. Now is a better time to get in than at ATH
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:08:07
and they always get in just before the crash
