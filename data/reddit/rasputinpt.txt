I have some doubts here... I read a lot about this hash war and I understand that will be a significant hasw power involved in the dispute... (bitmain using 90 000 machines). My question is: that hash power war can make the BTC vulnerable for lack of hash? That's the reason for the deep, the pool have predicted that, and dumped some BTC so they can't be exposed???

Ok Bitcoin can or cannot be a Bubble... For me, the bitcoin is great, with great technology, and everybody says is backed on anything, I disagree on that, bitcoin is backed by trust, by a new kind of financial system that is totally new and we didn't even start to use the potential of it... bitcoin is going to be the Gold who is backing all the other crypto like gold/oil do for fiat... And that doesn't mean the fiat is going to end or disappear or the financial system is going to be replaced, sooner or later the big whales are going to have all the majority of the coins because they have strong hands, they have the means, they control governments, the media, and banking system, and they always win...  So, in the worst possible case I can lose 100% of investment (really doubt), but in other and we can make 2x; 4x; 10x; 100x; %, I'm going to ask you sincerely, Don't worth the risk to put that extra coin on crypto and hold to it??
