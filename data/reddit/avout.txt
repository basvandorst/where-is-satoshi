Oh that sucks.  I thought it was cool technology.

I don't get the issue is here.  If New York saddles it's exchanges with onerous regulations, why wouldn't people just take their bitcoin business overseas?
Am I missing some reason as to why this isn't the simple response?

Um...that is how legislation is passed.  Ever see a bumper sticker?

Bitcoin has not solved the problem of transferring real American money.

That's a little vague.

Sadly, Apple's two-step verification system rarely asks for the second step.  You can (or could) successfully brute force the password and not be asked for the verification.

I believe that is new behavior.

Isn't the problem buying bitcoins using cash?  Unless there is a machine with a cash receptacle it would have to go through some electronic path, no?

I don't see how ApplePay is a competitor to bitcoin.  ApplePay could easily be used to transfer bitcoins in some future, right?

OK. Then it must have been old fashioned phishing or the like.  Sophos was complaining that there was no limit on some aspect of logging in.

Solution to what problem?  I don't see the problem so there's no need for a "solution."

Just pointing out that Apple Pay could support bitcoin, but bitcoin could never support the the fake fiat money that we all actually use to buy most everything.
