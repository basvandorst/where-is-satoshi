Alice has a channel with Bob and can pay Bob. Bob has a channel with Carol and Carol has a channel with some Shop. So Alice can now buy something from the shop by routing the payment through Bob/Carol to the Shop.

Yes, hardcoded maximum
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:03:50
You would need to rely on other parties to signal parameters what they will finally do. It doesn't matter if the calculation finally is a hardcoded rule, because the parameters will not be hardcoded --&gt; Byzantine General Problem
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:58:51
Anybody can fork whenever he wants. There are already 1000s of alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:42:21
Yes. It is a consensus change.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:39:37
That's not how we should go forward. If your approaching a cliff you should not go forward, even not with half speed.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:56:23
No Hardforks for this kind of changes!
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:20:24
Yes, send me your bitcoins. I will too take care of, lol.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:50:15
That's not logic
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:40:01
Agree on consensus of a parameters --&gt; how do the miners agree?
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:42:26
Because only a fool shoots himself in the foot
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:57:05
Segwit is the compromise
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:36:27
There should be no split of coins, more something like a future contract of BU coins, not related to actual bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:33:40
I predicted it: see BCU on bitfinex. And BU lost!!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:19:11
When everybody sets this maximum or any other parameter: the network of nodes and miners has a problem to agree on it.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:28:06
They will simply lose money every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:07:37
There is no governance in bitcoin land
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:55:01
How do nodes agree?
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:23:58
Customizable size adds the Byzantine General Problem back into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:11:07
There will be no successful hardfork of BU or the miners!
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:17:31
There will be no HF
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:43:14
This should be a financial instrument to find out what the market wants before a HF is considered.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:06:47
Bitcoin is made to resist this attacks!
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:46:52
If if if if .... I would be a millionaire, the king of all kings and immortal.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:39:55
Things that threaten the survival of the p2p network.
@_date: 2017-03-11 06:36:14
Neither do I. So I should have written: no HF!
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:37:28
BU coin will be an alt coin! 
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:20:53
It doesn't matter how much, miners can fork when they want, but they will not get paid by the network.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:01:47
It's not about the hashrate defining if something is successful or not. The question is if it is technical sound and tested.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:13:24
There will be no successful HF of BU/miners!
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:35:21
There will be no HF
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:51:50
Why should we follow and jump off the cliff when technical people tell us not to jump.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:58:47
They would need to find out what is the acceptable block size by the network. They would need to trust other people what they signal.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:38:05
There will be no hardfork by miners!
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:09:56
In science you do not just hope. You try to find ways to simulate, test and check the outcome of it and then decide. You also should think about what could go wrong and have a backup plan ready. You definitely should not listen to the people yelling the loudest.
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:15:00
Yes, just made one tonight.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:45:58
Users of bitcoin will not let emerge that bug into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:44:56
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:23:25
Whoever listens
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:42:00
No hardfork for x MB.
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:57:57
There will be no HF
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:30:01
Not running blind in the direction where the loudest noise comes from is a very important feature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:59:06
Can we still change the Bitcoin protocol header?
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:48:12
Would be bad if only hashrate would count
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:46:32
Already dead
@_date: 2017-04-09 09:43:06
SegWit UASF - 29.4% = SegWit UASF
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:59:48
Hardfork is not acceptable
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:34:23
Miners shall signal when they are ready for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:46:40
You shall not lie
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:45:43
No hardfork for scaling, no compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:43:27
Miners tell us when they are ready for SegWit, no vote by miners.
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:27:56
BU is a bug
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:51:01
A HF will not increase trust
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:50:13
Doing a HF once, reduced trust -&gt; everything could be changed.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:29:27
Hashrate can fork whenever they want. But it's the nodes that count.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:45:38
Who do you trust changing the 1 MB limit? The people screaming the loudest? The ones with the money? Some developer? 
@_date: 2017-04-09 09:35:43
No hardfork, we can do everything with softforks, no need to empower the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:54:14
Core is a software source code and not a person or a group of people
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:36:06
BU itself is the bug to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-01 04:44:57
No, as long as there is no hardfork.
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:29:20
I'm ok with changes like segwit as long as there is no hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:26:32
BCC fork will fail. So they will be back in a very short time.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:05:40
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:34:55
Just built the UASF software for my node.
