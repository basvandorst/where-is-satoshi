It is early days in all fairness though. I agree for now but we need to see how it evolves.

Wait, isnt central banking just gambling?

Plot Twist: No transfer fees on fiat currencies
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:52:28
Altcoin pumpers? Some altcoins are manipulated yes but to consider all altcoins as Bitcoin clones or copies is wrong imo. Some are not trying to compete directly with Bitcoin and if anything they may help to bring more attention to the cryptocurrency space.

Could be true but we have to see long term what's going on. I think Ethereum is better from a general feature perspective. Also things like fees are not making a pretty picture at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:37:21
Except it's not. It's just a way of making more space in the same block. But I don't see what the options are when the same thing happens again which is inevitable. There is no long term scaling strategy. Segwit is just a short term fix.

If BU gains enough hash-power then it will be the dominant chain if there was a split

Swear the first thing you learn in science class is that correlation does not imply causation?
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:54:28
You could also say the other way round that Core is blocking block size increase. Both perspectives seem equally valid to me.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:05:13
Actually having multiple options of software is a good thing. It's actually part of the decentralised model Bitcoin follows. The fact that Core isn't the only one is what makes things work. Otherwise Core could do whatever they want and people wouldn't have much of a say.

Weird thing is both sides see it as an issue with the other side so good luck figuring it out! Looks like a joke now maybe something will sort out eventually maybe before bitcoin gets its place in the history books?
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:17:34
Coinbase has also dropped now.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:08:38
They are taking part in risk by being an exchange as well as offering the service so yeah they will want to make money. All exchanges have fees and when you have something like Bitcoin there is a chance for massive losses. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:19:12
And there's a chance it isn't a person but a group too!

Question is... Did she buy it with BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:53:30
It'll go back to $900, seems to be decent support there.
@_date: 2017-01-12 14:44:18
I think we'll see this maybe a couple more times who knows how many. I think what will happen is after a while of getting used to this happening eventually everyone will be caught off guard when it doesn't crash after a big increase. So far every big increase comes with a fall and at some point the fall will be so small in comparison.

Had a customer at work who had an issue with their phone and I sorted it quickly. I went to apps and saw they had circle installed so I opened it and they didn't have an account so I quickly deleted it! ��
@_date: 2017-01-18 08:36:42
Because no one needs the main blockchain! That's so 2009! 
@_date: 2017-01-09 11:22:16
Imo Core should always be criticised if they're the biggest node dev as they always need to be kept in check. Bitcoin will never be boring in that respect the more questioning there is the more secure the network will be. Any change such as segwit should be difficult because it opens up the possibility for control. 
Basically Bitcoin should always remain a wide community and that includes people with opposing viewpoints! 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:51:52
Why would anyone want it to hit 1.5k or more during this month?
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:05:08
Increase of UK volume with coinfloor's recent announcement and removal of trading fees.
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:03:39
Gotta think maybe one day the size of the blockchain now could one day be generated every week! 
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:30:35
He didn't state he thought that was the reason but I don't think anyone really knows 100%
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:47:47
Unlikely and you should hope not 
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:07:33
In the end this will happen because we want it to happen. Bitcoin will evolve over time and the best part of it is that it will get better exponentially the more it continues to be valued!

Some say bread wallet but I find Mycelium the best as it has more options

It was shown in New York State that it was actually mainly outside New York City but I'm guessing it increased everywhere.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:49:42
Yeah and he says that doesn't matter because the overall inputs is where the fee is spent. You could use an input of 100 bits and one with 0.1 and those combined would then be subject to the fee. It's difficult to assume because they could be tiny parts of a big wallet in some ways.

Still hasn't released his key and seems something may be up. Always good to continue questioning until we see him at the balcony.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:19:48
Well after this surely they wouldn't go back to Central Banking? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:34:12
I think it would be surprising to see it fall by that much. Some bad stuff would have to happen. Bitcoin is stronger now than it was then.
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:51:30
It works both ways? 
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:01:41
Everything dies though?
