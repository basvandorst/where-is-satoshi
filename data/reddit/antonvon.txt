Right. Bitcoin is the one and only crypto currency that will ever be used. Any other coin will fail. Noted. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:39:36
Are you really this dumb?
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:42:26
God, you're annoying. Yes, i realize that you and others here don't want to upvote bad news! Yes, i totally realize that! I answered your question many times already. And i also pointed out how sad this behavior is. 
You bought in at 400 and can't handle bad news so you have no reason to upvote it and many reasons to downvote it. 
You think it's perfectly fine and accepted to abuse the voting system. And i think this place would be nicer without people like you. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 00:51:42
I'm sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:43:13
Why would they?
There are tons of currencies they don't offer. 
I'm suprised you're acting so surprised. To 99.999% of the world out there Bitcoin doesn't exist. Try getting out of this sub every now and then. You seem a little detached from reality. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:49:55
Just don't click twice!
@_date: 2015-08-29 12:31:32
And don't forget reasons. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:05:53
I'm not gonna explain the voting system to you. You wouldn't care anyway. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:43:37
Americanaidiot owns -100k so no, he didn't spent 100k on a design. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:36:36
People are actively downvoting bad news, you clown! Just stop. It's dumb behavior and very typical of this sub. Stop acting like this is normal and decent behavior. It's not. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:48:58
The rest of the world has no need for it. Which is pretty obvious after almost 7 years. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:50:19
Based on what exactly?
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:59:22
The reply to our discussion was off topic. You have to be kidding me?
You're downvoting me because you don't agree with me. We both know that. And it's pathetic as hell. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:17:50
There's nothing to expand. 
He simply won't accept that less people pay with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:30:56
It scares me he doesn't even realize this. The voting system really could use an update. It gets abused more than it does good. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:44:16
Yes it is. Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:11:49
Or it will just go down more. You forgot to mention that option. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:43:43
Traders love price crashes. They will keep using Bitfinex. They don't care about you and the coins you "hodl" waiting to get rich. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:25:45
57% upvoted. You people are hilarious. 
Bad news = downvote it to hell. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:46:24
Ok, good for you then. Still not sure if you will make any money mining. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:22:53
You really can't think of even 1 reason?
Let me guess. I'm getting downvoted for implying that someone might want to use a different coin in the future. Obviously even hinting at that is not allowed here and must be downvoted till it's not visible anymore. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:14:38
Yeah, it's sad that you and many others abuse it because you won't allow bad news here. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:23:48
Are you downvoting me?
Do you people realize what the downvote system is for? It's for spam and off topic stuff. And not for downvoting someone you have a discussion with and don't like what they are saying. Downvoting someone you don't agree with is extremely childish. And just plain dumb. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:27:55
Sure. Gyft is one of the most popular places where people spend their coins. When their sales drop that much that says a lot. Keep telling yourself it means nothing and that everyone else has increasing sales. Keep living in fantasy land. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:49:45
Because? Your coins will be worth more? 
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:30:21
Where do you buy your weed. Looks like some good shit. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:41:42
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:49:04


Stop lying to this guy. There is tons of risk involved and he most likely won't make any money. You're full of shit. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:31:34
So you come to a public messageboard to virtually downvote people you have a discussion with? Fuck me. That's just so...sad. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:39:59
Internet currency of the future. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 21:07:37
Damn, that's crazy! Next thing you're gonna tell me those Nigerian mails i get every day are a scam. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:00:35
There is no such thing as free electricity. You're gonna piss someone off. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:54:20
Sure. Right. 
So why should he get in then?
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:00:23
Exactly. No such thing in the echo chamber. Only good news please. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:32:27
Man, i'm not saying it's impossible to make a profit but you claiming is pretty much risk free is just retarded. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 23:51:43
What is it with Bitcoiners and throwing their money at scammers?
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:50:44
Awesome advice!
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:34:13
Surprising that you can't handle reality. You're normally such a rational and sane Bitcoin cul...errr user. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:51:16
God, are you people seriously gonna do this now? It just shows how desperate you are. Believe me. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:40:39
and i'm sorry for your loss. 
Keep on downvoting bad news and acting all desperate and i'm sure the price will magically go up again. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:38:59
What does that have to do with my question?
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:26:54
Yeah same thing with the murder for hire thing. 
First they say no way Ross was involved in this. 100% lies. And then they blame the FBI that it happened and it was all his fault. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:52:56
Hilarious. As always completely detached from reality. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:12:14
Ok. So no fraud can exist whatsoever when Bitcoin is used?
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:48:00
Huh? Why exactly would he do that?
How do you people come up with these crazy thoughts?
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:35:23
Not many people left who actually want to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:30:02
You're not implying Ross got a life sentence for just selling some drugs are you?
I also wonder what about your comment people are upvoting. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:42:55
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:54:01
Yes, people making fun of you. You're new at this, aren't you?
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:03:41
What charge? The murder for hire? He is still being charged with it in the upcoming Maryland trial. You people STILL don't realize this? It's been explained 100 times by now. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:59:38
Sounds like the free market to me. And something many Bitcoiners would do if they had the chance. 
Also why is it when Ross got convicted everything was a lie, made up, a conspiracy but when this guy gets convited everyone is 100% sure he's guilty and should to jail for life. 
Can anyone explain that to me?
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:52:53
No. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:53:21
Because your thread sucks. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:47:06
You got downvoted because common sense is not allowed in these kinda threads. Ross is innocent because he provided drugs to these people and used Bitcoin. That's it. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:51:20
Well remove Paypal and start using Bitcoin then. Let us know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:28:50
Because how much should he get according to you?
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:31:33
Reminds me a lot of libertarian Bitcoiners. An awful lot. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:45:32
Sounds like the free market at work. Do you have a problem with that?
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:06:32
So you are saying that once someone pays with Bitcoin no fraud can exist? You are seriously saying that? Are you really this far gone in fantasy land?
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:45:19
What significant evidence exactly would've changed things for Ross?
He still did all the things he was convicted for. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:42:28
Ross tried to kill someone (6 people in total including a few innocent roommates) and he pretended he was helping him. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:10:14
That you are paranoid as hell?
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:02:28
Huh what?
