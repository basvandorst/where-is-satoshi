most of the selling pressure is from Japanese who own 55% share of btc, they are fed up of Binance 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:00:42
Reality is Japan owns more than 55 percent of bitcoin share in the whole world and most of their users use Binance exchange, they started selling right after the news came up, if 55 percent of bitcoin share is shaken then you can expect these type of huge falls, Its not fake news Binance owner commit it, you can check his tweet

Everyone is happy with this statement but no one is thinking of G20 summit also called Japan to crack down on few exchanges which causing hacked crypto to dark money, shutting down of few exchanges is expected in this week, which will cause huge selling pressure, smart traders knew whats gonna happen today and tomorrow, Japam owns more than 55 percent share of crypto and bitcoin, thats why Japanese showed bearish behaviour today and price is still in 8.2K everyone was expecting buying behaviour from Japanese morning but they are selling prior to meeting outcomes

@_date: 2018-03-23 21:49:46
It doesn't matter where ever Binance is based, right now they are based in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Then why they got warning from FSA Japan, its nothing to do where they are based its all about how they are operating in Japan with registration License or not. Binance owner try to over smart thats why he stuck. He never disclose real information If he do so he lose his business value. He got hacked and people lost money and he was saying all is good. At the end users suffer losses. He gives lollipop bounty to his users to keep the attention away of course. Its for people safety if they move their coins from binance later they can come back when they will get permission

Malta can't take the place of Japan, Japan alone owns 55 percent share of bitcoin market, Nikkei  decision not only shaken Binance but they indirectly affect bitcoin, because most of users in Japan are on Binance exchange, from 55% share 25% must be using binance , So it could affect 15% further downfall, Some people might not be agree with me because they every time shout bullish bullish while market is in Bearish cycle, We need to be realistic because many people invest their hard work earned money, so I recommend new entrants to wait for one more week.
