Hey guys,
with version 0.14.0 it is necessary for me to have swap enabled. Otherwise the syncing will stop with the following entry in the debug.log:
"Error: Out of memory. Terminating."
I'm syncing with 2048 MB swap at the moment and I don't have any terminations anymore.

The transaction just got the first confirmation.

could you please check the following transaction? It was sent about 7 hours ago.
It was sent with the Jaxx wallet and is a shapeshift transaction, so I had no control over the fees.
I'm aware that there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions at the moment and so on.

Hey guys,
I wanted to share something with you that I encountered while downloading the blockchain on my raspberry 3.
(I have a 1TB HDD mounted that is connected over an active USB-hub)
I thought it might be a good idea to have a maximum sized swap file, 2048MB, and increase the dbcache via the bitcoin.conf on 1024MB.
The result was that I had constant crashes of bitcoind  and had to restart over and over again. It probably didn't even run an hour, I haven't paid attention that close.
After removing the swapfile completely and reducing the dbcache to 100 I have had no crashes anymore since 48 hours.
(Chris Ellis recommends a dbcache of 50 in his guide

I can directly confirm one user who is has lost BTC through this wallet. (No, not me)

This article by Andreas Antonopoulos was the most understandable to me.

In a little bit more than 10 hours the BCH hashrate will be adjusted to +400% and it will be less profitable again. Hashrate will then go back to Bitcoin.
