Language us important! Thanks for clearing that up :) 
Any system on top of the blockchain would require systematic rules dictating return transactions. It would be a lot like now, basically you are screwed unless you get authoritative power from banks or law enforcement and courts to return a transaction. That's where the arguments get hazy for me, if I am implementing systems on top of the chain that require third party authority then why change at all?

Coinbase is the least random website in the exchange world. On top of of the only exchanges that have not been hacked!

It's like there is a lesson to be learned here somewhere.

Thanks for the well written comment, may I ask why blockchain is a  better solition for the secure land registry than a centralized database system managed by a trusted third party (if thats how it would work)?

Hey Mentors! What is the expected impact on price of GDAX offering the bch/btc pairing this week? Will both increase? Will BCH go wild like the last GDAX attempt?

I think you could argue that mutability could be implemented systematically while preserving the underlying immutability in the block chain. Basic example may be a reversed transaction in the system living on top of the blockchain actually ends up creating 2 separate transactions on the blockchain the initial transaction, and then the return transaction. This could preserve immutability in the blockchain. Is it practical, I don't know, but it is just an example if I understand things correctly.

Wait a sex, how would overstock be able to send back BTC to yuour BCH address? This would not be possible unless there was another step in which you enter your BTC address. Right?

This is why it is always awkward for me to discuss with others. Now I try not to but if the topic comes up my close friends always look at me as if I need to say something. The proble. Is anyone bringing it up now it is always to say how nothing backs it and it's going to crash. Or it's worth it for only a couple hundred bucks...I wouldn't waste my breath for a couple hundred bucks people.

Jesus somebody feels strongly. For many it seems to be the best starting place in the world of crypto exchanges.

My new years resolution is to give, then save, then spend. Scary for me, but I will start with a small percentage and try to increase that giving percentage each year if possible. I would like to be a generous person, and this is the order of money management to get there I believe.

This should be required reading. It has given me new perspective. Thanks!

Gov. backed blockchain defeats the purpose, for the most part. The whole point is to not have to trust the government or the banks to ensure your coins have value. 
FDIC doesn't protect your gold investments either, yet is still OK by many.
Unproven? Only to those who heard about it yesterday.

Another option is an offline laptop that you store your wallet/keys on. Then you connect online only to transact. No web surfing or apps or anything to risk the keys.

Dont understamd bitcoin? There is no physical bitcoin. You can take a blank coin print some shit on it and say it's a physical coin but bitcoin is entirely digital.

Literally a piece of paper can be stolen, ruined, burned, thrown away. Jaxx on a safe phone that required a password and then a pin to open Jaxx with your 12 word backup phrase kept with your folks or left in your safe deposit box and you should be good. If phone gets stolen you wipe the data safely and use 12 word code to reinstate the wallet.
If you are talking 100s of thousands of dollars then a hardware wallet is your best bet, but frankly I don't trust those things either.

- I think it can be part of a sound investment portfolio. In fact it is a part of many sound investment portfolios. The general consensus is to not risk more than you can afford to lose with 20% maximum of a portfolio total. Keep reading more about it and you will see the same opinions. I'm speaking in terms of crypto currencies in general not just bitcoin. I think something will come along to challenge bitcoin in the future almost certainly.
- It's obviously not as robust and the markets not understood to the extent of the other options you have listed.
- Tax rules have been in place for a couple years now regarding taxation of bitcoin and other crypto currencies. 
- Don't disagree about the tech. 
- I personally try not to be naive about this. It works until it doesn't I suppose?
- Perhaps the value in bitcoin isn't as a currency. Perhaps it is more like a commodity, like literally digital gold?
- There are solutions to the limitations you have currently listed, but it will take time to resolve and implement. This is why things are exciting, because it is early and you are early to the game.
There were naysayers in the early 90s with internet technology as well, but if you believe the technology will play a role in the future then I think you owe it to yourself to make a small investment in that technology. That's what I think at least.

"This isn't even 2 percent of my portfolio". 100,000 bitcoin! You have to be kidding me.

North Korea hoarding botcoin is a terrible sign for the futurenof biycoin in America, i believe. If there is serious build up to a conflict with western powers, it would be in the interest of such powers to devalue bitcoin anyway possible. Regulation, manipulation or whatever, it does not spell out good news for bitcoin IMHO.

My mom keeps saying that I have "supposedly" made a lot of money with bitcoin, despite the fact I'm driving a new jeep paid for with money obviously from bitcoin. Or I robbed a bank. Thanks Mom!

The kind of person in which coinbase has served it's purpose reasonably and literally sees tons of newbies entering the space through coinbase and it's application. The fact that it's one of very few exchanges that hasn't been hacked, the fact that it if6fers some insurance policy. The fact it took it's fight against the IRS public.
I don't know, what kind of a person could I possibly be?

Maybe last year, but what you are missing is the goddamned train of innovation and change that is crypto and bitcoin. Give it 5 years and the exact reverse may be true.
