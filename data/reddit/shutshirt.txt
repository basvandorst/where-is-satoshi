if if if. Currently there is a block reward so that isn't an issue. Individual fees never will need to be significant, only the total fees do. Miners do not need to make a large amount of money on every transaction especially when they mine a large number of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:56:40
When Bitcoin or an altcoin becomes mainstream it will not need to worry about empty blocks. In the meantime we have a block reward to make sure it is profitable to mine.
Full blocks prevent us from ever getting that throughput. Why do you want to cripple Bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:09:40
I appreciate the links but I am more interested in the short term now. I am paying $10 to send transactions and that is making Bitcoin unusable for me. I have to look for alternatives like Bitcoin Cash that work today instead of ones that might work tomorrow. This cannot survive long enough for RustyReddit to work out the kinks and grow adoption.

How can I know the future?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:14:48
Why exactly do transaction fees need to be significant? How much would it cost to run a node with 64 megs? Have you done the math or are you just saying this because others have told you so?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:09:34
Kinda like how the earth was made in 7 days*
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:19:35
What does organic smell like? Do you have experience with studying large network traffic? Do you have any idea how much it would cost to spam the Bitcoin network when fees are this high? Anyone doing that would go broke real quick
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:17:48
Yes, offchain is the solution. I reccomend Bitcoin Cash. Fantastic off chain solution
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:13:36
So we need someone else to act a certain way for Bitcoin to work?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:08:32
There is no certainty that Bitcoin will survive 100+ year especially when the developers refuse to scale. Cryptocurrency will survive that long but Bitcoin will not in it's current form. Scale or die.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:55:21
Yes but no actual places I can use it yet right? No companies offering themselves as hubs yet?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:00:52
It's been in development for 2 years. Not sure why this takes so long or why we need to hold up adoption while they figure this out.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:20:04
Where is the lightning network. Would love to try it

Confirmation times are not important. The average user will be unwilling to wait for a confirmation so unless it is under 10 seconds it would not matter if it were an hour.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:59:11


I would say the same to you. Please read the question before wasting my time with a reply.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:20:47


I am doing using. I buy things I need with it. Overstock is taking Bitcoin Cash now, and hopefully Purse.io will wake up and follow suit soon.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:10:52
I was talking about full blocks not the fee market
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:56:36
What is stable about their mining? They have yet to prove their willingness to increase the blocksize and scale. Also I would rather promote the original chain rather then a copy coin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:16:56
We have a blocksize to prevent a miner from filling the block with a terrabyte of transactions. When the transaction fees are $10 each, then it isn't a DDOS attack. Any miner filling the 1 meg block with 'spam' is paying $10 for each spam transaction by not accepting a paying transaction. This isn't spam, these are all legitimate transactions and you would have to be a fucking moron to think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:24:43
You claimed they were parasitic. This is not a common belief among any group. 
The link you referenced claimed sending traffic through them slowed down propagation. This is true, sending data directly to the miners is faster. That is different then saying they are parasitic. 
You also avoiding my question about CW. Why reference him and not Satoshi. It was Satoshi that first predicted that nodes (mining and otherwise) would be run in datacenters.
To be clear: this isn't something that people are in favor of encouraging, just an inevitable conclusion of global adoption of Bitcoin. Lowering the blocksize will not change the fact that mining nodes are typically run in large datacenters. Have you seen a way to prevent that?
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:14:17


What are you talking about? They are still using ASICS with Segwit. They cannot profit from off chain transactions, and that is the only problem they would have with segwit from a purely financial perspective. So moving off chain forces miners to share transactions revenue with LN hub operators.


AFAIK Mcafee isn't a miner. I wouldn't call Roger a miner either. Roger may have a pool, but I wouldn't say that is his primary occupation. Roger is primarily a user and a promoter. 


They are a player behind the push. There is plenty of community support for this. I don't understand why you are against a minor 2 megabyte increase. This compromise is the only reason we have Segwit.


There are plenty of people in the big block calling for innovation. Ever heard of extension blocks? Bitcoin Cash has a proposal to remove Tx Malleability. I think you are not talking to any big blockers.


It is not change that we are against, but terrible proposals. Segwit has a maximum block weight of 4 megabytes and will allow approximately 2 megs worth of transactions. A 2 megabyte block has a block weight of 2 megabytes and allows 2 megabytes worth of transactions. Segwit is a bad deal.

What is wrong with paying miners? They are providing security for the currency. I do not want to pay a large amount per transaction but I don't mind paying them ten grand for a hundred thousand or a million transactions. Do you? What do you think would happen if mining were to become unprofitable?
It isn't the miners that are calling for larger blocks. It is the users that are fed up with $7 fees. I do not mine and have been asking for it for a few years. Fees have been $1-$2 lately, but how much will that be as adoption goes up? We have lost a lot of market shares to the altcoins that aren't against scaling.
No, I haven't used Segwit. I am not interested in installing new wallets, as that requires trust and time to backup. If I am given the option to use them with my current wallets I may test it out.

How is Segwit faster? The speed is the same with or without segwit.
I get that it lowers fees, but so would 2x. 2x would lower fees even more as it does not require people to make special transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:51:05


Why do you think Segwit "has low fees, plenty fast and works great"? Is it because it enables a LN that does not yet exist? It is a blockweight increase. The merit to increasing the blocksize has been proven with Segwit. Everything else has yet to be realized.


The fees are not little, 1-3% is quite large.








You are right. We will need to increase the blocksize to about a gigabyte. I don't see a problem with that. A global payment system will require a large amount of data to pass through it and your home computer won't cut it. 
Let's do a little math. 7 billion people on the planet. Let's say 1% of the people use Bitcoin in 15 years. 3 transactions a second is approximately 100 million a year. That means each person will be able to do 1.35 transactions on chain per year. 
Using the LN will require two transactions. That means everyone will be able to fund a hub approximately every 17 months. You will not be able to fund more then one hub at that rate. Every transaction you send will need to go through that hub. Does that sound decentralized?
I am not against a LN. I think it is a great idea. It needs to be done in addition to increasing the blocksize. We need to be able to afford to do on chain transactions and we will not be able to afford on chain transactions without a blocksize increase.
Do you really think anyone will want to run a bitcoin node if they cannot afford to make bitcoin transactions? Why would I want to watch the blockchain if I am only able to afford off chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:23:15
According to who? You? Who gets to decide what is and isn't an altcoin?
Bitcoin was created by the whitepaper so I think that should be the deciding factor of what is and isn't an altcoin. Since Seg2x follows the rules set out in the whitepaper then whether or not it is an altcoin will be determined by hashing power. 1x, if it does not get enough, will be the altcoin.
In a two months we will see 1x called Bitcoin Legacy or some shit like that and 2x Bitcoin. Of course that is assuming 1x keeps enough hashing power to survive that long, and I wouldn't bet on that.

Not being up to date on the latest tweets != being new. 


You don't need to worry about offending me, I do not respect you enough to care what you think. 


I know why they are pushing things. It is for the same reason I am. Lower fees, bigger adoption, better currency. 
I have listened to enough interviews of Ver to understand his position. I have listened to enough interviews with Vay to understand he doesn't understand the tech. Mcafee is new here. The other Core supporters are trolls pushing nonsense or lies.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:04:02
You must be new here. It is Core that wants higher fees not big blockers. They have been calling for a fee market for a while and now we have one. Do you think shrinking the blocksize will somehow lower fees?
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:59:38
Citing a source involves linking to where it was said. Since Ver never called individual nodes parasitic you won't be able to do that.
Why mention Craig Wright for the second one when you could instead cite Satoshi. He was the first one to mention that mining and non mining nodes would eventually be done in large data centers. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:59:17








Huh? I am not following you. ~~The first comment about it being an altcoin. Were you talking about 1x or 2x?~~ Are you changing your opinion? Which is it? Is 2x Bitcoin or is it an altcoin?

I have been trying very low fee transactions and have learned that my fee estimator isn't very good. I made a few 20 cent transactions and they went through. I had to set it to the minimum fee and my wallet didn't think it would go through.
