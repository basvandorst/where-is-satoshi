May be fixed, but it works for me.

Would this mean that btc-eur will drop or btc-usd will skyrocket?

I was just surprised that BTC is worth so much more in euros. One question, wouldn't it make sense to buy in USD and sell in euros?

Use the coinbase app for verification. That only took a few minutes for me 2 hours ago, and also verifies for GDAX.

I made a few mistakes in my original post. Clearly i have made a bad mistake and lost some, but i don't know how.

Recently started using EXODUS, which i think is called an offline desktop wallet, which supports multiple currencies. Probably not the safest option, but alot safer than online wallets at least.

13k now
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:55:26
14.3k already!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:02:38
The price for btc is now 14300EUR, which is about 16900USD, while the price for BTC in USD is about 15k

One mistake, i bought 0.01 when it was about 9800 and 0.01 when it was about 11k.
I calculated that i paid around 30-40$ in fees, but i don't remember what the fees was for.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:19:09
Coinbase, and then transferred to another wallet. Did a new calculation, and it was around 18€, so about $20-21 in fees. I actually dont know where the rest went tbh, because i've been almost 40$ negative. May also have been some convertion fees from NOK to eur when buying, but it shouldn't have been that much.
EDIT: Seems like i've also paid about 6-10€ more than i bought. I don't know if the NOK has gotten weaker or something like that, or if the bank just charged heavily because i bought in euros. Makes a little more sense now.

I myself is very new to btc, and you probably shouldn't listen to me for advice.
I understood it as it is an offline wallet, but you'll have a backup online. You also have access to your private keys.
I may be wrong, but i know it is safer than online wallets atleast.

You can always take out some, you don't need to take out all.

Was ofc supposed to be €, fixed now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:41
They were on an ath of about €14,8-14,9k earlier today according to gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:24
Now i don't know what other coins you have. I only have btc and eth,  both are supported along with a few others.
