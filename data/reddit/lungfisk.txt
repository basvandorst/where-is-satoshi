Yup.

While I agree with the spirit of your argument, your use of the word literally can't be warranted. I would bet any amount of money that there is at least *one* person in existence whose interest in bitcoin is SOLELY technological.

Not what I was saying that in the slightest.
My goal was only to disprove the statement that 100% of bitcoiners are into BTC for the money. A single exception would accomplish that goal. No need to discuss any other bitcoiners. Of course there are many, many motivations, many of them co-occuring. I was only complicating an overly simplistic assertion.

Ideologically I'm on your side, and therefore recommend you stop before you make "us" look any worse. Stop the adolescent antagonism.

Crypto currency experts are spending their time coding or thinking about technological problems - the word you're looking for is "finance people" (or perhaps better yet, "hucksters").

Then I agree! 
Unless one is already ludicrously rich, money is a vitally important personally scarce resource - it would be disingenuous to claim to have no financial interest in what is at its core a kind of currency / payment / asset

If someone trips and falls in the middle of winning a race, the fact that they won doesn't mean they never fell. Collapse is a slightly dramatic but not incorrect description (*especially* if it continues to collapse, to $0 USD / BTC, even though I strongly doubt that will happen)

Sure, absolute "altruism" (where you help others with zero self-benefit of any kind) doesn't exist. But "feeling good" is a benefit that doesn't disadvantage anyone. So if only focusing on concrete, zero-sum type rewards (e.g. any given loaf of bread or bitcoin which can only be eaten / spent once) altruism does exist.
Being altruistic doesn't mean that you're a selfless paragon of virtue, but it does mean you're practicing a behavior pattern which is admirable and conducive to improving the common good. Which is what actually matters in life.

How is the supply cap a problem? Most seem to see it as a positive thing (no arbitrary printing of money).
Since individual bitcoins are obviously highly divisible, what's the downside of the 21M cap?

Sure, human brains, mycelium, and neural networks share certain properties.
So it's possible that Bitcoin was created by AI, but it may also be a mushroom.

Reference I'm not getting? Or just mental breakdown?

Great, now you've spoiled it - I'm shutting down the Bit Coin! This is why we can't have nice things. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:55:07
Just leave it alone, man... What's to be gained? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:06:28
The Truth is (already) Out There. 
Confirming it accomplishes nothing beyond breaking someone's anonymity/safety.

I have bought lots and lots of drugs from the Internet for several years now, and am not AFAIK in jail. Despite not being powerful or wealthy. It's not that hard. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:53:27
Exactly. Anyone who's paid attention agrees that OP is probably largely correct, but that there's nothing to be gained by further investigation except possible harm to SN (if still alive, in part). Just leave it be.

Nowhere near the same, but the feds got about 2000 of my USD. Bastards. Lesson learned though.
