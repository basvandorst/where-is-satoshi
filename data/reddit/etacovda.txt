thats not what the OP asked, you're just inciting here. Pointless post, people understand that btc was stolen. Jesus.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:24:15
hes saying whats gone, not whats hes bloody liable for. How is this difficult to understand?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:24:58
both the replies I've gotten from these comments explain why lots of people see bitcoin as a scam, cart before the horse mate.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:23:10
well, hes not wrong..

If you're all in, and you don't care about the price but more the core principles... why are you worried again? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:33:37
the irony is, theres a good chance they are to blame (with others) for the gigantic pump over the year anyway.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:53
yeah, i was around in 2013/14 - this is exactly what some were saying back then, and the market share was smaller too. It'll probably drop more.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:10:43
Well, it went from 1.2k to 200 bucks, and this bubble still happened. Bitcoin doesn't care 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:24:37
how the hell is that bullshit? Are you really that ignorant? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:56:13
oh no, and what investments return like bitcoin does? if you cant wait 2/3 years for huge gains you're an idiot - and thats if you're right, it could go nuts in 6 months.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:04:21

@_date: 2014-01-29 19:14:12
yeah but the credit card number isnt encrypted, is it... 
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:17:57
yeah, its utter crap on mobile. Horrible website.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:48:27
If you look at videos from back when the internet first started to take off, they were doing video streaming (albeit at like 3 frames a second) for video chat. It was poor in technicals so obviously didnt take off like skype, but it was discussed. Remember also that the only thing stopping the majority of uses for bitcoin is that they havent been invented yet, not the fact that there is technology holding it back.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:07:40
Hell, a lot of people would love to go away from the 'in god we trust' bullshit. Separation of church and state, anyone? its ridiculous that money and politics are tied to Christianity in the USA, what year is this again...
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:18:47
would be a good idea to get someone to look over things before you post them, if you can. Your inaccuracy here does not breed confidence - this is a security based product, rightly or wrongly accuracy of your spelling does reflect on your possible accuracy with your product - and people could be trusting serious money to you in this case.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:23:35
then everyone wins - the person creating the site would undoubtedly have bitcoins. If ebay accepted bitcoin, it would probably fuel another speculation bubble.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:59:08
They are selling on exchange not market. Days destroyed is irrelevant.

because china is all for getting outside cash inside the country, just not letting it leave. See every factory, sweatshop etc that services the wests consumer lust.

Uh where are you? In nz we have had direct deposits to bank acc since at least 2002.ive used online payment for the majority of my adult life. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:10:53
Do you have online services at your bank? I log into my bank account online, and it has everything I need. I can simply receive money by quoting my bank acc number and the other person just needs to deposit into it, all can be done online, including automatic payments.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:48:57
now it just needs to be internationally available. Go overstock minions, go! (i assume this might be something to do with regulations, can anyone confirm?)
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:23:08
Can I ask how old you are? Because the internet has changed the world immeasurably, The only way i can see that is by not being old enough to have seen it.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:36:40
gah, its definitely. Defiantly is something else entirely. Seriously dude, you need to get your spelling in order - as soon as i see any spelling errors from someone on the net i about 1000x less likely to buy anything from them or take them seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:20:41
Which is not a problem, and creates price stability, because if you spend and buy the same amount the result is zero. bitcoin as a technology (blockchain) is going nowhere. Bitcoin as a currency, who knows over the long term, but over the medium term, i very much doubt its going to dissapear.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:37:30
because you still have to put currency into that wallet, and it has to come from somewhere, so it can be tracked regardless. A new wallet does not solve this at all.
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:44:54
Loved the fence shortwave radio idea. Crypto really does feel like looking into the future these days, its going to be fascinating to watch it unfold.

This is a retarded idea. They will almost certainly paint it badly if they do anything at all.,
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:15:20
The important "wars" are financial these days, not actual men on the ground. Whilst the USA keeps it's unsustainable policies and methods the same, china will only go up, because they're playing the long game. Greed is going to kill the west, history repeats.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:05:27
Yeah, I have thought the same thing. There are a few companies who do not make sense on the surface, since they barely make profit, but they are extremely useful for monitoring the planet.

You do not need confirmations, you need network propagation. To fake a confirmation you'd need hundreds of millions of dollars of computing power and prowess... to skip paying dinner.

@_date: 2014-01-05 08:01:09
Yeah arrow town is not rural by any stretch
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:42:32
If you read section 3.2 of what you linked, the window is 2-3 seconds for network propagation - its quite low. It will not propagate if the coins are already spend on the network - the spend happens at propagation, not at confirmation. We wait at least 2-3 seconds for most creditcard/eftpos payments to go through. 
What i said hasnt changed, you'd still need millions of computing power to fake confirmation. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:57:29
And for Byrne, if that happens, bitcoin will go ballistic and he will be fine if he's holding coins. I'd call it a calculated move, albeit risky.

Yeah, you realise that that's what most rich people think of the poor - you are just as bad as them.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:00:07
Well, to put it in perspective, nz expects cheques to be completely obsolete soon; I believe we are the world leaders in electronic banking, but I do not doubt it will happen elsewhere. We have zero restrictions on moving money between banks; perhaps it is a tax thing in the us. I have used a grand total of 3 cheques since I have been running a business and receiving and paying rental income or fees.
It is as simple as depositing to an account number, and accountancy for business can be done automatically with csv or PDF downloads from your bank to make it even more seamless.

@_date: 2018-11-25 07:23:57
yeah, and people arent working on bitcoin and changing it constantly. You have to love it when people hamstring themselves.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:12:43
and if you'd thought that 'years ago', you'd still be up thousands of percentage points.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:16:17
what? have you ever even bought on an exchange?
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:54:46
The funniest part is that people want crystal ball certainty in a speculative market. Now the markets actually got a huge back end with a lot of development going on (id bet 4/5ths of the people here have zero idea about bitcoin, aside from price) they're asking if its ever going to be anything again.
, BTC was the news written on a sweaty nerds jock strap in 2012, and it still hit 250 a coin. If you're not in it long term, at this point, you're gonna lose out either way. Its a speculative asset, dont look for reason, look at the possible big picture and ask yourself if you're willing to take a risk for huge returns. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:24:38
I thought you were being downvoted for that godawful meme bullshit, turns out you were trying to be horribly sarcastic and just showed your ignorance. Lol.

in a while - but its still not there yet. People said that in 2013 - took 4 years for the next bubble to happen, not a lot had changed. Bitcoin was on the news etc in 2013, much like 2018 - it dropped, then everyone forgot. Theres no bullet proof 'final use case' for bitcoin yet, but its still an amazing idea that cant be faked by others simply due to the computer processing power thats thrown at it. Perhaps we will see its true colours when GFC2.0 hits, which its overdue to do...
I personally think the BTC price just run by manipulator whales, and we are just along for the ride - and i dont think that dec 2017 was the last bubble, but i have zero idea when the next one will be. I'm generally a pessimistic person - so whenever i have this feeling I tend to listen to it (take of that what you will)
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:43:55
Unsurprisingly people don’t sell for less than market price
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:28:57
are you people all new here, or what?
bitcoin was all over the fucking news in 2013.
Either people are shilling, or straight out retarded and werent here when it happened.
** I was there man **
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:26:53

@_date: 2018-02-06 09:26:09
happened exactly the same in 2013. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:22:54
which is exactly what happened in 2013. If you think the whales in bitcoin are just going to forget about it, if you think the people working on bitcoin and related tech are just going to go 'oh well, the speculative price crashed, better stop working on anything crypto related' then youre just as bad as those at the top of the bubble screaming 'this time its different, new paradigm!'
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:31:28
its actually easier than it looks. Just dont buy when it a giant fucking parabola unless you're willing to be burnt. I bought and sold on the way up the parabola, the trick is not to sit there thinking 'its going to 1 million'

I saw someone on a gaming forum win a block by himself, about 8 years back. 50 bitcoins. He sold them for 700NZ dollars - if he sold them right now, that'd be 620kNZD. If he'd sold them at the last bull run at the peak, he'd be a millionaire.
Do you think hes still enjoying that graphics card, or do you think hes kicking himself for selling a million dollar opportunity....

For a class A) dont swear B) remove the slang aspect, ie "pretty much" C) dont write things like 'what i forgot to mention' unless its a huge bullet point that you want to get to later on that reinforces another point. 
reorder your discussion so it flows properly. Other than that, a good  overview to get people interested.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:43:38
Might be a dump for pumping reasons. Dump the coins, let the crash happen, buy back in lower, wait till it's higher again, profit a shitload from market reaction.

best. bf. ever. Hows it feel being potentially a millionaire very, very shortly? (or did you sell?)

excepting? exceptions to what? english motherfucker etc?

as soon as i see an obvious grammatical mistake i automatically discount the writer as an idiot. This is one of those times.

im surprised this doesnt exist already. A slick short viral video would go around the likes of facebook very quickly

yes, in times of fear we seek familiarity.

people bought at 266 and the bubble popped - those people are sitting just fine now - assuming they didnt sell out.

er, i wouldnt count on it lasting another 16 years as a long bet, but if you keep an eye on it and cash out at the right time its probably worthwhile
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:01:18

Your life plan involving retirement with bitcoin suggests you are on fantasy island.

tldr; bitcoin will continue to cause issues as it will be used as a get-around mechanism which will draw further attention from govt who will then seek to shut it down. Exactly what bitcoin doesnt need :/

fair enough - i was thinking mainly of the use of it for online poker. i really think that could be damaging, since the US shut that down already...
