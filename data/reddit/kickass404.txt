What exactly did you think you bought when you put money into bitcoin? There is nothing behind it, nothing to eat, nothing to use, nothing to hold... In the start it was ideology that was driving the price of bitcoin, now it's hope of getting rich. Some people are getting rich right now, with the money people are putting in right now.

There was a post that said only around 1M addresses have coins, if that is true and people have multiple, there is only 250K-500K active accounts.  And they don’t use, they hodl right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:12:21
Of which only 1.000.000 actually have coins (according to some other thread).

My money in a bank account is covered by the government if the bank goes bust. (Up to a certain amount, they don't cover over something like $250.000). Also the bank is liable if they they fuck up my account. Regulations and stuff. Nobody covers your virtual monopoly money. If you loose it in a fire, gets stolen or something like that, though luck.

Ever heard of a letter, the infrastructure/people/asserts that was used in delivering them? That is struggling to stay alive right now and eventually it will be niche.

There is no value in bitcoin, it's just like a EA game. People receive trading cards for time spent. They sell the cards to each other for money. As long more and more people play the game, everything is fine, but as soon people stop and sell all their cards or no new money enters, your legendary card collection is worth $0.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:55:06

email didn't require you to buy it at $17K a pop. Try using pokemon trading cards instead.
You are buying a $17K card in hopes to sell it to someone other in the future at a higher price. It's the only reason you are here. Maybe there will be a buyer, maybe you just have a worthless card.

Eur/Dollar has the support of the people, government and sizeable and real asserts behind it. You think 9 trillion is much in that regard? The stock market blipped 2 trillion on the Brexit vote and that didn't put us all on the streets.
Bitcoin has hot air.

It says so in your own link, but just like most bitcoin owners you are awful selective of the things you read and just choose to ignore anything that doesn't suit your agenda.

None, until it’s regulated or declared gambling, you’re just playing high stakes monopoly.

It's only a dip if it goes up again. Considering mainstream people lost money this time...
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:09:30
As I understand you, you want to sell at a 35% dip. Just because you want to sell, doesn’t mean you will be able to sell, there needs to be a buyer, no buyer or huge supply, you just end out with a sell order in the backlog worth 0$ (assuming a total crash).
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:48:21
What you classify won't matter a lot in court. It's not regulated, if you broke the ToS, your legal position would properly just be the same as in world of warcraft, they get to keep your virtual stuff :-)

But can Bitcoin owners without money buy one.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:27:42
For you to withdraw $1.8M requires some one/others to buy bitcoin for $1.8M. USD doesn't magically appear out of thin air when you sell a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:04
The second supply in sell orders is higher than demand it won't rise any more. The second no one wants to buy a bitcoin it drops to zero. 
If the the coin drops  a lot and average people start loosing significant amounts of money, there will be a run for the door. Why do you think you constantly see coin owner make "HODL" threads, you think they care about other people? No, they know when people start running for the exit, it's over. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:23:17
The US dollar is backed by an elected government, 300M peoples work, the land and the resources on it, a military and law and order. That $1 paper note has power and resources behind it.  
Bitcoin is hot air, it is no different that the kickass404 coin. There is only one in existence, cypto signed and all that shit. I think it is worth $10.000.000, if you don't think that too, you are missing the larger picture entirely.

Every time someone cashes out, their coins loose value in fiat. Every time someone buys with fiat, their coins gains. Fear of loosing their chance to be rich and ending up with a huge loss.

Only in the form that people borrowed money from them to finance the coin bubble to get rich.

Because it's only worth in USD what people are willing to pay for your virtual pebble? Might be $1.000.000, might be $0.  Pray bitcoin never goes out of fashion.

If fiat crashes we are all fucked, if bitcoin goes down, it's just a bunch of people who lost money and they got told they would.

There is no value created in bitcoin and it is not used as currency. Every profit he makes someone else has to loose or HODL forever for it not to crash.

People selling
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:44
Banks aren't buying your bitcoins and giving you cash, some other person thinking your virtual coin is worth what you are asking and gives you cash. It's mainly people trading virtual coin on a forever increasing cash value... until people don't think it is worth what you bought it for. It's fifa17 on a hype train until people loose interrest in the game.

Sell 1.000.000 coins for $0.01 to one guy.
Then sell one coin for $10.000 to another guy.
You have $20.000 and two guy thinking the market cap is now $10.000.010.000 (1.000.001 coins * $10.000)
