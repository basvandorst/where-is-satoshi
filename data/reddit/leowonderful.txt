Kano.is all the way. Lowest fees, active owner, pays more than pools like Slush with a 2% fee compared to 0.9% on Kano. Plus Kano doesn’t mine empty blocks like Slush occasionally does.

The problem is the 1mb block limit. we're making too many transactions, and the last 48 hour blockz have been full to the top. Aand thats why people are trying to get 2mb blocks

Blockchain.info is moderately good but there are still many vulnerabilities to it. People have gotten hacked on there in the recent past and it's just not a good idea for storing too much money.

Don't think there are any ATM except for the ones where they just distributed the coins. I expect a drop tomorrow or whenever the exchanges get around to adding it as people start to dump again (people who didn't want to send all their coins to exchange, which is a lot of people).
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:41:55
I'd still be happy if we went down to $1200. I bought most of my coin near $700 and $300, even if this price stays for a year I'd be just fine.

@_date: 2017-11-06 17:41:59
I personally think you should go for a hardware wallet in case you get more in the future. Security is important for any amount and blockchain is infamous for being buggy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:24:11
Yep, can’t always take advantage of all openings but take advantage of the ones you can take right now. I missed becoming a millionaire then but it doesn’t mean I can’t buy up now and HODL.

Centralization at its best.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:26:22
I'm also 14 and I hold around 30k in crypto, most of it in Bitcoin. Keep holding and mining, I do the same by hosting my miners at various facilities and my miners are making more every day. Not life-changing money by most people's definitions but still a good sum for someone as old as me. Considering I started literally from nothing I find it good. 
Colocations or hosting services are a good idea if you want to continue mining. I find them on Bitcointalk and rent them to put my miners there. When my S7s became less profitable I sold them. No problems with noise and you still have full control of your miners. I had to work around my age and kept my age mostly anonymous on bitcointalk and now I am a fairly reputable green trust member.
Due to my age I have never sold and I couldn't easily do so even if I wanted to. I guess that's a good thing. I've only ever spent my coins. I probably won’t ever sell my coins in any event.
Finally, buy a hardware wallet and never forget the true purpose of Bitcoin. I feel people forget that these days.

@_date: 2017-09-14 12:23:08
Well if the exchange halts trading obviously some people want out and so they're selling, explaining the temporary $2500 on BTCC. US exchanges don't seem to be near $3000 yet. We could eventually reach $2500 in a worst case scenario but I find it quite unlikely. BTCC bounced back quite well after that dump as well, so I don't think it'll be the end of the world.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:06:47

They do, and Kraken allows you to buy without verification under a couple thousand. 
Gemini is sub-1% IIRC and Kraken is variable. Both are lower than the 4% Coinbase charges.

I actually heard about BTC when I was 10 in 2013 but didn't bother about it. I got into it later but it was good enough for me. Now I'm making enough money that I earn 10K a year in Bitcoin, and I can buy whatever things I want- new pc, clothes, etc. Of course I will continue to HODL ;)

Bitmain has enough money to support mining on their own chain for at least a little while to get their way, but like you said not indefinitely. It’ll be interesting to see what happens.

That's exactly how I thought it probably was in there when I passed by the building, there were a whole lot of stores cramped near there. I really didn't think it'd be too bad from the outside, but perhaps that's because I went past it during the late evening a few times and the place was probably more empty then.
Visiting family over the summer in another province, decided why not go to Beijing so I took the high speed rail there and went to see the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square and forbidden city. Really can't believe how much stuff has changed since I left a few years back, awesome to see how much progress has been made and nice to take a break from crypto for a bit. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:33:25
I visited Beijing about a week and a half back and actually saw Huobi's office in Beijing on a street corner (somewhere around Shangdi I think). I didn't expect to actually see their office there, but I saw their logo and after searching around a bit it seems it's actually their office. Not super related to what's been mentioned but I thought my experience was interesting considering I hadn't thought about crypto at all during my trip 'till then.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:14:44
Considering how much money Bitmain and co. make and have, they can afford a few losses to get their way in the long run.

It's always possible to use a VCC and VBA if you want to get verified at a cost, though be aware there is definitely some risk involved. I'm verified from a VBA and VCC from Bitify and it's been smooth sailing for about a year now.

Depends if you used a wallet on your PC and if Bitcoin-QT or whatever software you used was still on it. You might also have used Blockchain.info or some other web wallet, which in that case you can just scour through emails to try to find the wallet. I recall pulling up Litecoin web wallet accounts off my Gmail account recently after the price rose up, my first use of them since about two years.
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:07:43
Not as of yet. Bitcointalk forum member Sidehack is planning on building a pod miner, USB miner, and blades that fit in S1/3/5 frames and he has worked a deal with Bitfury for chips, but progress is slow on that.

I did that yesterday, fees aren't horrible right now and it's a hassle free way of doing it. There are risks associated with keeping coins on an exchange, though. If you don't have a deposit address generated right now I would suggest getting one asap as the generating service was very slow yesterday.

Most server PSUs are of high efficiency either way. Pretty sure my DPS 800GBA runs at near 90 percent efficiency even though it's not 80+ rated. 
These guys say the DPS 1200FB is platinum but I am not sure if this is true (probably is in terms of efficiency)
I can say these guys are hella reliable and will run even under the worst conditions, though. I recall I ran these one snowy night in the garage with the door up and it didn't even skip a beat even though the outside did rust a bit.

General upwards trend above at least $3500. We are seeing traders buying the rumor and selling the news right now (taking profits if you will), but this is temporary and once resistance at $3K is broken we will go upwards without much of a hitch. Some have sell orders at around $2900 to get in front of larger ones possibly at $3K.
