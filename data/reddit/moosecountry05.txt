Yeah litecoin is the only alt. coin that hasn't tried or said litecoin vs Bitcoin, or that litecoin is better than Bitcoin. Litecoins moto  from day one has been a complimentary coin to Bitcoin and wasn't created to compete and take over. The creator is very humble and wants Bitcoin to succeed heck he works for Bitcoin, all he wants is the 2 currency's to co- excist and work together and not fight

How can another alt coin take over when no one buys it? No ones going fall for shit coins anymore. Bitcoin litecoin and dogecoin will work together as one to solve this problem by sharing the combined block size to handle all the transactions from small to big. It will be the Fab 3

Hi Max iam a lawyer trying to sue you
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:50:14
Yeah Bitcoin for big transactions, litecoin for lite translations, and dogecoin for 5 cent candy transactions.
...gotta be a way to pay for an item at a retail shop using a pin pad then at that second Someone who pays In Bitcoin it then gets switched automatically to let's say litecoin depending on the amount you are buying I.e a smaller transaction, that litecoin can handle smaller transactions so it doesn't stress the Bitcoin blockchain out. Kind of a shapeshift idea when you pay in Bitcoin the users them self don't have to switch currency's based on the dollar amount they are spending so it's easier on the specific block chain.....
...does that make any sense to anyone? Feed back please
@_date: 2015-06-29 01:53:07
No that's why Bitcoin was created for things like this happening, choice is yours to safely secure your money

Bitcoin one day might become centrlzed from the big banks, and stock markets controlling how the masses use Bitcoin,and you guys wont even know it. other alt. coins may be the true de centralized currency's.

It just hit me why every country wants and will want the population using crypto currency. It's simple people are paying and receiving payments with virtual money and thus the banks and governments will hold all the "real" money and the gold. Which is kept in their own country and less money leaves to diff. Country's and they will have more buying power. 
Does that make some sense?

its not about greeks buying bitcoins, its a realization that this can happen to any country. Bitcoin was created for situations like this, and now people are aware of how dangerous keeping large amounts of money in a bank can be and now they have an option. people for the first time in history can protect them self by storing there hard earned money and information on the blockchain, even golds price is rigged and gold has no ledger.
.... its about awareness of other country's and how they can prepare and have piece of mind by learning from can happen and probably will happen to every country some time in their life time. Greeks arnt making bitcoin price go up its other people who now are aware and have the power to fight back against the big bank machine that will eat you alive.

I agree Bitcoin will be more anonymous when it hits critical mass, at that point there will be no need to cash out once it's accepted by everyone. It will truly be peer to peer with a wide range of acceptance.

Lol not now, so when the price goes up that's when you invest. Usually when people say don't invest, you should invest. And when people say buy buy buy, you sell. All the top investors buys when people panic sell and then sell when the markets hot

Hey man I bought in at 2.35 last year before the boom and cashed out at the high points, for the first time in my life Iam finically set I had 2300 Litecoins and sold them at 40 35 and 30 I was able to to get cash out because it is an active currancy, some people in this world like choices that's what crypto currencys are all about, that's why Bitcoin was created so people have a choice from the evil banking system and that's why other nations not only buy Bitcoins but ltc and doge and so on.My choice has been ltc/btc and with my profits I have donated over 5btc to the Bitcoin infrastructor and community so in my world Litecoin has complimented Bitcoin cause I was able to give back to the main crypto, Bitcoin is king and with out it no other coins would have value. Side chains are the free expressions and values that Bitcoin was created on...... So keep calm and side chain on
Is there anyone here that agrees with me or do you all think all other cryptos should be deleted or not created if it was possible, so no one has any choice and only option would be Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:27:08
Wow that's pretty expressive I love Bitcoin more and more each day and it is catching on at an incredable rate. The fact that improvements and innovated ideas for Bitcoin is frictionless due to the fact that no one company or corperation controls the rate of success, but now they are forced to compete at fast rates to be able to profit off ideas before the next competor does.

Bitcoin will never die, governments  around the world wants it as the new one world currency so they can hide money trails, and store hidden wealth to avode taxes. Billions of dollars will flow in from the drug trade, the masses will use it for micro payments, plus the average joe can travel world wide with out worrying about airport security stealing there money if it's over 10k. People in 3rd world country's are now able to have bank accounts and be safe from hyper inflation. 
..that's just a drop in the bucket for some of the reasons Bitcoin will never die that's why I don't even worry about the price and volatility right now because we are in the beginning stage and everyday there's gains and positive news.

There's to many groups that own large amounts of Bitcoin, there's to many rich and powerful men that own large amounts of Bitcoin. There's to many start up company's like Gemini and Coinbase and other multi million start ups we don't even know about and that's just in this one country let alone the whole world. 
......My point is there's already to much money invested in the infrastructure and acepteince from respected organizations that also have invested interests and the power to make it go mainstream at the right time. There's basicaly to much money to be made for them to just let the value of Bitcoin dwindle to nothing.

I read an article on how all the new big and exciting projects are being hush hush right now for that reason, also that big Bitcoin meeting with all the top Bitcoin start ups met in private, I assumed they talked and agreed on not to create mass hysteria because that would be bad for the stability. The twins once said once everything is in place for Bitcoin and the price skyrockets it will be to late to get in these prices ever again. Basically one day you will wake up to seeing the price of Bitcoin over a 1000 and every Bitcoin start up companies will be pumping and doing a huge Bitcoin advertising campaign on t.v news commercials magazines to push Bitcoin to the masses and make the price stable from not giving us pre warning on how big Bitcoin will really be

It's a free and open market I've made a lot off Litecoin and bought Bitcoin, and people like to have choice. The creator of Litecoin was the first speaker at the Bitcoin expo, he explained how Litecoin was not in competition with Bitcoin but to complement it. And of coarse any coin can go down or up, and truly its up to the public which one has purposes for there own specific needs. Maybe a lot of Americans may think it serves no purpose but other parts of the world like China are huge buyers. So buyer Coin on

So you give govt. all your cash and gold, and in return they give you coin that is backed by a currancy that is 10 trillion  dollars in debt, they track you and seize coins cause you got a speeding ticking, and when the dollar collapses so does your coins.....bahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

148,063 bitcoins is one ton of gold 
Yet again it only took 6 years for 148,063 bitcoins (a ton of gold) to equal $35,206,028 
It took gold 1000 years to reach that number per ton of gold ....you can't win cause 150,000 Bitcoin (virtual money) is worth more than a ton of gold
Also Bitcoin is flattered your comparing Bitcoin to gold *blush*
