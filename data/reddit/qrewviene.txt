During the cold war India was officially neutral, but they strongly favored the USSR over the US.  Their economic system wasn't called communism, but it was closer to socialism than capitalism.  Only in 1991 did they start to open up their economy, so I'm sure that the old mindset of centralized control still lingers among many.

The problem is your utility company isn't handling demand effectively.  This could be due to mismanagement or it could be because of legal constraints on its behavior.

Correction about the correction: from $32 to $2.
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:46:10
Actually, the high that day was $32.  I know because I was the sucker buying them at that price.

This really isn't a good idea.  Any sort of deadman's switch has a pretty high chance of failing, either giving them info sooner or (much worse) never giving them the info.  The risk is just too high.
You need to leave your keys with an heir that you trust.  That's really the best solution.  It is what I use for my large amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:24:42


No they won't.  They'll just write a check for whatever the price was before the price went up.

I have been involved with bitcoin since 2011 and I understand this topic well.
Block chains can be edited.  You can't improperly edit the bitcoin block chain because the cost to do so is astronomical.   A private block chain run by a shady company would be pretty easy to edit by that company.
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:48:28


I don't think so.  Maybe some did, but I think that most people stick with it regardless of the price that they get in at.  Everyone I know who bought bitcoin still owns it.  I bought at an all-time high.

Do not contact the thief.  If you want this money back you have to stop acting like a kid.  Use serious tools to get a serious job done.
Contact a lawyer.  Have your lawyer send a letter to the exchange, demanding that they freeze the thief's account.
Subpoena the exchange in order to get the thief's information.  Have your lawyer contact law enforcement in the thief's jurisdiction, to freeze his bank accounts and all other property.
Testify in the criminal case and sue for restitution.  Get your judgement and confiscate his property.

Bitcoin transactions are faster and cheaper than gold transactions.  Understand why gold has value (hint: governments can't print more gold) and you will understand why bitcoin is still underpriced.

As the first halvening approached, people said that the price wouldn't change because it was already priced in (efficient market theory).  It wasn't, and the price shot up.
As the second halvening approached, people were expecting the price to shoot up again. History did not repeat; apparently it was priced in this time.

Well then they should open up a massive node on the lightning network.
Bitcoin doesn't exist to eliminate middlemen, it exists to eliminate central banking (inflation/deficit spending).

Slush invented mining pools (and hardware wallets).  When his pool was getting close to having the majority of hash power he actually encouraged people to use other pools, so that Bitcoin would remain decentralized.
Bitmain supports hostile forks and was the major sponsor behind bitcoin cash and bitcoin 2x.  Bitmain is trying to bring Bitcoin under its control.

Bitcoin transactions are much faster than credit card transactions.  A credit card takes something like 90 days to settle.  A bitcoin transaction takes ten minutes to settle.
Bitcoin transactions are still cheap, only a few cents per transaction.  This is much cheaper than a credit card transaction.  Bitcoin transaction fees have been high in the past, and will be high in the future.  Fortunately, the Lightning Network solves that problem.

Those people aren't making as much profit as people who buy and hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:25:55


Nope.  We bought it because it is hard money like gold, but was priced at a massive discount.


I bought in 2011.  I still have most of my bitcoin and I'm a millionaire as a result.  I'm thinking of buying now.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:44:52
Yeah, Bitcoin undermines their whole world view.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:05:57
Fewer than that most likely.  The site you cite uses a ten minute block interval.  Historically, that isn't correct.  Another site estimates 508 days to the halving.

I bought a house with some, spent a little on solving problems, and keep the rest in Bitcoin.  I'm planning to sell 20% a few years from now, and my children will inherit the remaining 80%.

No, because he is a criminal.


Apparently not.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:31:28


That's not nonsense.  Nonsense is the average holder thinking that he can come out ahead by trying to time the market.

$6500 to $5500 is not a real dip.  Anyone who is bothered by this needs to do some research.

You think like a poor person.  In healthy families, the husband and wife operate as a unified team; the wife trusts the husband to make good decisions and helps provide input into the decision.  When the couple is not unified, short-term thinking prevails and opportunities to get ahead (such as bitcoin) are passed up.

I compare its main competitor: 1oz gold coins.  If Bitcoin captures 1% of that market then it should be valued at around $5000 per bitcoin.  As goldbugs die off and are replaced by bitcoin holders we're going to see more and more of that value transfer to the new form of hard money.
Based on that, I believe that we'll see a floor in the tens of thousands within a few decades.

It seems like the average transaction size is around 4 bitcoin.  Many people don't want to risk that $15,000 with a technology that is only a few years old.  Paying a few extra cents for a non-Segwit transaction is the obvious choice.

Nick Szabo (Satoshi) is far right.  Bitcoin undermines socialism.  It isn't surprising that that the bitcoin community will contain voices that think outside the box.

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the house always wins.  Unless you are much, much better at trading than the average experienced trader, you should just buy and hold.  Otherwise you're going to pay more in fees than you extract from your rival traders.

Trademarks are complicated.  The general principle is that you must avoid confusion.
There is a line of RVs called "Starcraft".  A game series of the same name exists.  The two industries are so different that there is no confusion.
Local business in different regions can also have the same name, again because there is no confusion.

Bitmain was the major force behind the creation of bitcoin cash.  Bitmain tried to force 2X on us.  Bitmain defrauded its customers.  Bitmain is an arm of the communist government of China.  Bitmain has constantly worked to bring bitcoin under its control, and has attempted to destroy what it can't control.

No.  They are located at hydroelectric power plants in western China.  They pay almost nothing for power.


It is, for Bitmain.  From wikipedia: "with a net profit of $742.7 million in the first half of 2018"


Five years.  This is basic research.


They financed themselves with pre-orders from chumps.  People paid for the hardware, then Bitmain made the hardware.  Then, instead of delivering the product, Bitmain used that generation of hardware until it was no longer profitable.  THEN it sent (almost useless) hardware to the customers.  Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:32:43
A complicated system that is prone to failure?  One that creates a security risk bigger than the one that you are trying to avoid?
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:26:29
That's a reasonable theory, but do you have any evidence?  Are you sure that a significant number of miners have investors?  Bitmain is huge: they make their own hardware, they have access to almost free power, and work closely with the Chinese government.  I don't see why they would need to sell.

Panel 7 shows that the comic creator is an idiot.  Poor people don't have money because they either (1) never had any or (2) spent all of their money.  In the latter case, cash is plenty accessible to them.  In the former, it would be accessible if they were to engage in commerce.  Bitcoin won't change that.

You have three options:
(1) You can sue.

That's just about the worst thing that you could do.  Which is more likely:
1) Someone smart enough to recognize a private key breaks into your house and steals it, then sweeps your bitcoin before you realize.
2) You grow old and forget your password.  Oops, the money is gone forever.

Bitcoin is and always has been a right-wing currency.  It takes power from the government and gives it to the people.
