Wikileaks dump?
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:25:49
There's far more to lose by sitting on the sidelines. I would rather regret the things that I do than the things that I do not.

I remember when Bitcoin was $1.20 per bitcoin. I didn't understand it fully and thought I was "losing" 20% value by trading dollars for BTC. 
I bought some at $13 though and sold a while ago when it hit $1000 that was nice.
Bought my GF fake tits and everything

How to get files 
[here]( 
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:44:29
use wikileaks' own files to get a nice header list
Some headers:
AVI 52 49 46 46 
Torrent 64 38 3A 61 6E 6E 6F 75 6E 63 65
PDF 25 50 44 46 2D 31 2E
Zip 50 4B 03 04 14
7zip 37 7A BC AF 27 1C
Some footers:
7zip 00 00 00 17 06 
You can find this in cablegate.7z you can also make a file in your computer and search for this near the end. footers are not always at the end of the file, they are usually towards the end.
Zip 50 4B 05 06 00
PDF 25 25 45 4F 46
dont trust any headers/footers you find online. verify them yourself by using a hex editor. 
you can use hex editors on windows. if you want to find PGP/GPG files for example, make a couple of them on different computers and then look at them with a hex editor. 
you will see the headers at the beginning. footers are usually near the end. use 7zip as an example. 
make a 7zip file on your computer and compare it to cablegate.7z, you will find the footer near the end. see what file types wikileaks commonly uses, get the info for them. once you have a nice list of these, you will easily find all files of this type on the blockchain.

NORMIES PAY ATTENTION
Stop relying on scripts and crappy software. The steps to find every single file in the blockchain have been posted here numerous times &gt;&gt;22945. A lot of you have been staring at the data for over a week now. Here's another attempt at being even more clear:
Every single file has a hex file header. You can see a list of some here:  However, this is not the entire list. The lists 'trid' and 'file' use are not complete either. Yet, you don't even need these lists. You can simply look at any file of a type you are interested in finding. Yes, any. Open it with a hex editor and look at the file header. If you want to find a zip file, just download any zipfile, look at the header with a hex editor and then search for it. The headers are not going to always be at the beginning of the file. Scan the entire file for headers and footers.
Yes footers. Files also have footers! You can find the ending of a file by looking for its hex footer. Here are some examples:  Again, this is not a complete list. If you want to see what the footer of a file looks like, open one with a hex editor.
JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING COMPLETELY CLEAR HERE:
If you find 37 7A BC AF 27 1C, you just found the beginning of a 7-zip file. If you find 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A, you just found the beginning of a PNG file. These are just examples. There are a lot more file headers to look out for.
If you find 50 4B 05 06 00, you just found the end of a zip file. If you find 25 25 45 4F 46 you just found the end of a pdf file. There are more footers and you can make your own list by looking at different files. These are just examples. There are a lot more file footers to look out for.
Stop looking at only the beginning of decoded data. trid and file both do this (and badly). It can be anywhere in the transaction!
