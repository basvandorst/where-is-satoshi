All seems to be up and running again. Looks like it was just a hiccup, although an explanation still would be nice.

There are no traders that have consistently beat the market over any amount of time. Which is why ETFs are so popular: Trying to just replicate the general market is both much less risky and much more profitable than trying your hand at day-trading.

In other words: Predicting where it will go, based on the assumed continuancy of assumed trends. Reading tea leaves while trying to make it sound like it was maths. It isn't.

Yeah mate, you too. Maybe drop by and get some feedback on your next investment idea as well.

Thank you. What do the single dots represent, and why do they cluster like that? I can imagine a each dot being a functional unit of code, but I have no explanation how that would be defined or what the clusters represent.

So does astrology.

I'm laughing at my own ignorance here. I had no idea you could mix programming languages within the same project, I always assumed you picked a language before you start and stick with it. Thanks for explaining this, it's much more interesting to watch with at least a rough idea of what it means.

...and they still can't consistently beat the market.

Can someone explain to a humble confused biologist what exactly it is we're looking at here? Changes to Bitcoin Source Code I assume? No idea what any of it means, really.

I love all the people saying TA works despite the fact that no trader has been able to beat the market over any significant period of time.

No. The entire point of day trading is to take higher risks in the hopes of achieving an above-market return. Any strategy that is promising above-average returns is also taking above-average risks. Anyone telling you they can deliver higher returns with less risk is straight up bullshitting you.
Also, most people don't understand how to assess the succcess of any given investment strategy. They see a banker offering a fund that achieved 20% profits over the last three months, and assume that this means it's a great fund. But if the general market went up 30% in the same three months, the Fund was actually losing money. It delivered a below-market return. 
This is what most "traders" do: Achieving below-market returns. This doesn't mean they don't still make money, it just means that the money they make is actually less than what you would have achieved by just running a boring investment plan on a well-diversified ETF that tracks the performance of the entire market.

No, it's not. I'll believe it the moment one of them drops their pants to actually *show* it. Which never happens of course, because it's bullshit.
Documentaries are movies made to be sold. There is a reason they don't put conspiracy theorists and magicians of all sorts through particularly dedicated testing. Go in, take some pictures of something that looks vaguely impressive and makes people think "HOW?!?", then GTFO before anybody gets funny ideas on how to actually answer that question.

But it means the team isn't getting paid. It's essentially volunteer work, which in most people's priorities lies behind their (main) work life and private life. 
I do volunteer work now, but if my child gets sick or I have to work over hours at my regular job (or whatever else happens that takes a bite out of my time) then I will put the volunteer stuff on the back burner until shit is back to normal.
I assume working on an open source project is similar in that regard, meaning people drop out of the team for work/private reasons all the time.

Oh dear god.

Yeah, I know. What gets me about this picture is seeing the concrete numbers the very first adopters worked with. I have traded penny stocks before, and buying something at 0.06 and selling for 0.30 is something I can relate to as feeling like a pretty sweet deal.
Also, I realize that in fact it *is* a pretty sweet deal. In the end, the guy made some pretty decent profit. It's just that human brains aren'd exactly made to think strictly rationally about stuff like this.

Btw, does coinye still exist?

Well fortunately your level of seriousness has no bearing on the truth of your claim.

Fair point. I'm no economist, I just stumbled across the interview with Varoufakis and found it interesting what he had to say about it. I would love to see a detailed answer to his criticisms from the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:01:11
Varoufakis gave an interesting interview in which he talks about the dangers of having no means to control inflation of Money. If BTC or something similar were used as a national currency, that nation would be completely helpless during economic crises. There would be no handle to steer the economy back on course.
