Good point.

Truth. Wasn’t suggesting utilizing for payment at this time. But if use cases continue to be limiting, true value of bitcoin may never flourish.

Literally just about to post this. 
Is someone buying and selling immediately? They can’t be making any money with this strategy.... 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:10:35
Nice. Thanks

Coinbase lags in prices sometimes. You’re safer trading on Gdax to get prices exactly where you want them. Not to mention there are no fees on Gdax

Yea dawg. Just backin you up 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:37:41
No one knows. Good chance of continuing to go up as banks start to trade. I️ think buying now is safe. Only spend what you are able to fully lose. 
Do your research and make your own decisions.

Totes man. Good luck to all of us.

That too. That’s how these walls work. Every dollar usually has part of a bitcoin. Small buys eat that wall up. Sending the price either up. Or down if Small’s are selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:17:37
Absolutely. This is a daytrading strategy. Big whales put walls up to stop the price from going up to far. When it starts to go down. People have stop losses. So it triggers the price to fall harder. That same whale might choose to buy cheaper coins. Or sell during the fall. And get in really cheap. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:09:14
Agreed on that front. Might as well just buy on Coinbase. But in the meantime if you want to make a deposit on Gdax. Do so.

It will not drop half because of the split. It may drop because people with sell BTC after the fork. They want the other form of currency right now. But the split does not mean the price is automatically cut in half, no.

It never failed. It’s still very much worth something. The reason it was overtaken was due to an easy way to exchange value. Dollars. Then debit cards. 
Bitcoin is both gold and an easy way to exchange value.

Soxxx is dead on here. A lot of resistance. If you’re not in now. The safe bet would be to wait until we hit ~8100 to buy in. If it doesn’t break. Wait until it we see a bounce at ~6800-7000 or if we lose that support, make sure you watch if we maintain above 5800. 
There are a lot of scenarios right now and technically we are still in a major downtrend, if we break 8100 look for a blast off. 
Disclaimer: I’m a huge bull and think we will be way up by year end. Pending ETF decision.
