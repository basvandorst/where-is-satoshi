Is the karma requirement post karma or comment karma? Also is there a minimum withdraw balance for the tippie? i.e. can they withdraw like $1 or is there a must be over $50 limit when doing withdrawals?
Regardless pretty awesome to have this setup, thought the fees would kill something like this for BTC.

What I'm guessing is that the early run up was due to speculators thinking that the opening for CME would mimic the opening for CBOE. The initial buy in before the opening in hopes for a price spike on CME opening caused the pre-increase; once the CME market opened for BTC futures and no spike happened those same investors started to sell causing the price to drop back down to it's "normal" trend.
