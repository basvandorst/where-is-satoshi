If you're an American you're going to have to hire a tax advisor to tell you what your legal obligations for paying taxes on the initial value in USD and what the tax burdens are when it comes to holding on to any of it in bitcoin as an investment are.

Tell them you won an online lottery, and the prize is in another currency. You should look for someone who is familiar with international taxes. The physical location of the website may be an international tax issue, even with the winnings in bitcoin.

This wasn't the mid 90's. The instructions lead me to believe it's that it's 92-93ish. I'm sure the direct connection (2400 baud way predated '92) was there first, with their Compuserve address. 
Delphi added internet e-mail in mid 1992, and I'm sure the paper added it as well then. I'm 98% sure by 94' and 95' the Delphi address, Compuserve address, and direct BBS line would all be gone in lieu of a hosted webpage/e-mail with their own domain name.

I have one that I get maybe 40,000-50,000 a week from, filling out a few surveys and visiting a few websites for them. I also visit one that every hour you get 30+ satoshi but you have a 1.5% chance of a bigger prize. Four days in and I won 30,000 satoshi in one shot already, and so did someone I referred, so I got 15,000 from that. Not bad for a capcha every hour on my phone.
