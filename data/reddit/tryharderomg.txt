holy shit YES I KNOW THE PROBLEM IS IN THE PROTOCOL.
1. mtgox did not address the protocol glitch in their software and therefore were affected by tx malleability.
2. bitstamp did not address the protocol glitch in their software and therefore were affected by tx malleability.
3. only difference: mtgox probably lost money while bitstamp probably didn't. they both failed to fix the protocol glitch that was known since 2011.
4. IF THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHY DID THEY BOTH STOP WITHDRAWALS?
i know mtgox is bad for hiding this fact. nobody ever said otherwise. what's your point?

you don't understand how pyramid schemes work.
bitcoin does not promise ROI to everyone forever.
we don't have to constantly convince people to buy into bitcoin to maintain bitcoin's value.
bitcoin has value as long as there are at least two people using it. the more people use it, the more it costs, but that is true of everything of limited quantity.

okay well there is no guarantee but there are tools that scan your hard drive for deleted files and try to recover them.
the problem is that if the part of the hard drive gets overwritten then the file can't be recovered, so the safest thing would be to boot from a usb key with windows or linux (best would be tails in this case) and run the recovery software.
such software can best be found via google.
if the wallet is on a different hard drive than the OS then you can also use your computer to do this, but make sure that no data is written to the wallet's hard drive.
unless you can afford to lose the coins, then just boot and install all you like and hope for the best.

we can tell people that soon there will be convenient secure hardware wallets for everyone and if they get in now they will have early adopter advantage.
that raises bitcoin's market cap and price and will speed up the secure wallet development, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.

can you explain to me how you would conduct a double spend that earns you more than the lost block rewards in case it fails?
if they had 51% they would still fail 49% of the time.
if they tried to double spend a 6-confirmation-transaction they would have to earn at least ~150 bitcoin per double spend attempt, assuming that nobody notices 51% of the hash rate disappearing for an hour and none of the miners notices that his solved blocks aren't published anymore.
how many places allow you to anonymously buy something for 150+ bitcoins, may i ask?
how often do you think they could pull this off before a few miners are pissed off that half of the time they lose the last 6 block rewards and leave?

it's either an advertisement by the olympia guys or some olympia fanboy, propaganda from putin, or part of some sinister attack on your pivacy or maybe some obscure FUD campaign.
if your client spends enjoysochi along with some other outputs the sender might learn more about what other addresses you use, so it might come from the NSA or some hackers. 
but i don't think your client will spend those outputs anytime soon and i don't think one can gather any valuable data from this "attack", so i think it's just guerilla marketing to make people post about sochi on reddit. satoshidice used to do the same.
you could create a raw transaction to send the satoshi to sean's outpost if you know how to do that, or just keep it. 
or create a raw transaction next time you want to send something and spend the satoshi as a fee to some miner.

at first only mtgox was attacked, now someone is running one or multiple nodes (has anyone found the IPs yet?) that change all the transactions going through. some of those changed txids will make it into blocks.
that's why bitstamp and others also had to shut down for a while and fix their code.
even many clients were affected because spending unconfirmed change will not always work now.
the reason redditors only insult mtgox is because they don't understand the attack and some PR shills are spreading lies then upvoting them en masse.
it is true though that mtgox takes a lot longer than other exchanges to fix their code, so they seem to be indeed less competent than others, even though they all fell for the same attack.

bitcoins are sent around as a chain of transactions.
me -&gt; you -&gt; coinbase
if me -&gt; you has enough confirmations then a you -&gt; coinbase transaction can be assumed to be safe to accept with 0conf by coinbase.
if me -&gt; you is unconfirmed and you send that output to coinbase and coinbase accepts that then tx malleability may change the me -&gt; you txid and make the you -&gt; coinbase transaction invalid.
to pull this off you need to run one or more bitcoin node(s) with really fast internet connected to as many peers as possible that is modified to change specific or all txids and hope that coinbase accepts such transactions.

it is somewhat true but ofc mu twisted and distorted it, like sauron controlling the palantirs.
bc.info tricked apple into thinking their app didn't allow sending bitcoins. apple found out their app can send bitcoin and deleted it.
now trolls and fanboys make it sound like apple wouldn't have deleted the app if bc.info had told them that their app allowes sending of btc, but that is not true.
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:07:13
ah well, then it might not be worth the trouble. if you have another computer you could also plug in your hard drive there and download some recovery tool, otherwise flash drive or just boot it up normally.

you don't even need internet for bitcoin...


see [this]( and read articles about the future of the internet from the 90s.
nobody knows, either btc will solve those issues or commerce will have to divide across various altcoins or use applications built on top of bitcoin like open transactions.

@_date: 2014-02-11 05:14:57
OP is a known troll and the attack doesn't exist.
you can spend 0 confirmation outputs in bitcoin.
afaik the standard client chooses outputs like this:
outputs with 6+ confirms
if not enough, add 1+ confirms
if not enough, add 0 confirms
if not enough, fail.
There's a bunch of comments about how tulipfutures is a 14 year old asspie of low intelligence and self esteem, so maybe just upvote this one.
(for reference: the last sentence was a copy of OP's begging for upvotes which he edited out. that's why he's now missing a full stop. ah, so many users to annoy, so little time for proofread.)

no, you are wrong!!!!
you can spend even unconfirmed 1-satoshi-outputs and your transaction will still confirm!

OP the idea is great but your service must work without javascript.
really, do you think you can send a message to some anonymous bitcoiner who doesn't want to share his email with you and to read it he'll go to a website that could potentially uniquely identify or infect him with malware?
especially after listentobitcoins and all the other malware ridden sites stole so much btc lately.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:15:27
the point is:
we hate apple for not allowing apps to conduct bitcoin transactions.
we do NOT hate apple for removing apps for breaking its TOS.
we hate apple for having shitty TOS.
we also hate apple for selectively enforcing TOS because other (non-bitcoin) payment apps are allowed.

can you explain to me how you would conduct a double spend that earns you more than the lost block rewards in case it fails?
if they had 51% they would still fail 49% of the time. 
if they tried to double spend a 6-confirmation-transaction they would have to earn at least ~150 bitcoin per double spend attempt, assuming that nobody notices 51% of the hash rate disappearing for an hour and none of the miners notices that his solved blocks aren't published anymore.
**how many places allow you to anonymously buy something for 150+ bitcoins, may i ask?**
how often do you think they could pull this off before a few miners are pissed off that half of the time they lose the last 6 block rewards and leave?
apart from that i didn't really mean the risk of double spend in general but rather the "THERE IS CONFIRMED PROOF THAT GHASH IO IS DOUBLE SPENDING RIGHT NOW!!!!!" fud.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:41:35
all of this could be implemented into bitcoin, your argument is void.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:56:11
well the browser brought accessibility to the masses, so bitcoin's equivalent would be something that can reliably and comfortably be used by anyone.
so probably something like a credit card hardware wallet that can be securely taken anywhere and requires no skills to use?
this shouldn't even be that difficult, but bitcoin needs to scale better before people will see the benefit in using it. lower transaction fees and some way to keep the blockchain small. maybe store the blockchain in distributed form so everyone can help hosting it but nobody needs terrabytes of storage space.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:09:46
