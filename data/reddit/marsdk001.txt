by the looks of it they just did tranquilize him, but it is sure gonna be pissed once it wakes up, getting ready for that huge rally ahead... give it couple months.

Any value in anything, crpto's or stocks is faith, no faith in it - no value period.

zoom out and you will see the more patterns over years not just months, like a ~7 year cycle of stock market boom - remember 2007? patterns are fractals really
Bitcoin is quite new though and just has a history of 9 years, but it's graphs mimic not just financial one's but adoption graphs too aka S curve.

Sounds to me like Roger is getting desperate, the way he is attacking "The Bitcoin Core" development team, denying the fact that Bitcoin rose to enormous heights.
Also despite his first vision of bcash being as close to the original satoshi's vision - he is now attacking the difficulty adjustment of bitcoin which remains unchanged till today while bcash has changed their difficulty adjustment algorithm.
He has lots of holes in his arguments, if you do your homework, or if you followed bitcoin's story from August (since bcash fork) you would see it all for yourself.
Furthermore have you noticed that mostly he is not heard of until the price of bcash spikes and all of a sudden he is on the news, isn't it strange?

Bitcoin has faith of the majority because of the belief that the development is heading in the right direction, also, get it out of your head - it is not about the value it is about the utility, to put it simply Bitcoin is accepted on all exchanges while other cryptos aren't, Bitcoin has BTMs around the world, it has futures in traditional markets.

Because consensus remains on the Bitcoin chain, this is the majority and the forked one is the minority.
Why would the main brand have to change when a small group of people decided to leave and do their own project?

Transferring value across borders with ease on all exchanges, sure as of lately fees are high, but it's being worked on.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same, as for holding your coin I would suggest having it on a paper wallet or a cold storage(offline wallet) just like u/FriendlyNegro suggested, watch the videos he listed you'll get it, if you are unsure about moving your coins out of coinbase start with a small amount experiment and see how it goes, can't really go wrong though since its pretty straight forward.

Sure have missed our beloved bitcoin coin guy, HODL on.

Don't forget that it is your wisdom that is now being put on the internet for some Millennial to read and learn from, don't just put people in a box and label them. You have your own experience other people have theirs probably in other fields too, and by the way just because there is parallel between things doesn't mean they end the same way, although I do agree a big chunk of the alt market is in a huge bubble.

He also said " This cannot continue", implying to the rise in the price of bitcoin.
But I disagree with his view on the price, maybe in the short term, but we are in for the long run.

0.16 is the next version of the Bitcoin Core client that is being worked on, you can read about it on their website  there is probably more information on their github though (for the technical people 
if anyone has anymore useful information for anyone who wants to learn more on the bitcoin client please reply and share.
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:44:58
my bad then. but from what I'm seeing they do have an exchange up, not a futures one

So much ignorance in a single news studio, can't call it news anymore.
But you gotta give it to them, at least they are trying.
No book explaining bitcoin? How about Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos or better yet, just read Satoshi's whitepaper what can be better than that?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:20:56
If post SegWit activation most transactions were on supposedly SegWit blocks won't that make fees on the legacy blocks lower? In effect lowering fee reward on ASICBOOST mined blocks aka legacy blocks?

I see, was not aware of that, I was convinced he was seriously saying that.
You never know with these people, much bullshit comes out from news lately.
PS. Bitcoin coverage ain't one of them, keep it up!

Actually bitcoin isn't deflationary, it is still in inflation until year 2140, after that year it will only maintain it's 21m coins (assuming no change to the consensus), it might be considered deflationary though, if people are losing their coins(not to nefarious actors but really losing access to their coins).
As for fractional reserve, I don't see that working with bitcoin, for fractional reserve banking to work you have to lend more than you own, unless you have a way to produce bitcoins out of thin air it won't work.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:19:59
Market cap is not a good metric for measuring value, a market cap of $329 billion only hodls true if all 21m bitcoins could be sold for $15.66k, but as you can see with the current correction, selling drops the price quite quickly and market cap even quicker.
In reality traders(and generally buyers and sellers) provide you with a service of protecting price levels really.

Wait what? when was bitcoin even over a $1000 in 2016? your graph shows ATH of $2000... am I living in a different reality?
What exchange is that chart taken from?

Bitcoin repo is the repository where essentially the developers deposit their code imporovement propositions or BIPs and other forms.
I guess Segwit2X wants to have the control over Bitcoin's development, think of it as dethroning the current leading developers of Bitcoin.
But from my understanding the only reason Bitcoin has it's value is because the users get to choose the crypto currency they support, the users are the one's that give value to the currency.
So even if Segwit2X would get a hold of the Bitcoin repo and users are not satisfied with their development they will just move to another crypto or just follow Bitcoin wherever it would move to.

It is Omega  [ 
Also the last letter of the Greek alphabet which fits perfectly here as sat is the lowest (last) denomination of a bitcoin.
But since it is a unit of electrical resistance as mentioned here, it could interfere with it being widely used, but who knows

play agario much? it is not that easy to split a coin of bitcoin's size to 2 halves, see Ethereum's horrible DAO split for reference, yet still Ethereum retains a 10x value over Ethereum Classic.
Not advocating for any forks here, I just think that an upgrade is overdue for bitcoin, the transaction's ridiculous costs will be what will kill bitcoin if anything in my opinion.
