What happens when all the coins are mined?  Do miners get a portion of the network fees for helping process transactions?

Cool, thanks.  I finally got mine to clear by putting another transaction to the same wallet and paying better fees.  I got that suggestion from reddit somewhere...

I'm using the ledger nano S that everyone seems to recommend around here.  Without this sub I totally would have just kept everything on coinbase...  My transaction says within 13 blocks so I got that going for me.
edit: a word

Thanks for the info.  I'm not too worried, I just wanted to cash out a bit of profit and buy an unnamed alt coin.  
Out of curiosity what do I search for on the tool you linked?  The sending address?

I think thats based on the exchange you use.  I've waited a week for a purchase to clear on coinbase when the money comes from the bank as opposed to a credit card and the amount locks in when you hit buy.

Been over 15 hours now and still unconfirmed.  I have to say I'm a little underwhelmed...   Is there a pre set timeout for it to come back to my wallet?

Been about 3 hours for me here.

I buy silver coins for a SHTF type deal.  Easier to spend and silver has more real world uses than gold.   I’ve been resisting the urge to trade them for bitcoin...

Was your transaction ever confirmed?  I've been sitting on one for over 24 hours now.  Was my first time transferring from anything other than my coinbase account so I didn't know that $.09 USD was too low to get things moving.

Cool, I picked "normal fees" on the ledger. Was like $.09 USD so I guess I'll just check it in the morning.  I wonder how much coinbase skims off the fees lol...
