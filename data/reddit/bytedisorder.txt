The Plaintext email is fixed, now you are not sent your password. Mind you the passwords were always hashed in the database. However for less security minding customers, or technical minded, this posses a bit of a conversion decrease (not sending the password in the registration email). However with security in mind we now no longer send the password in the registration email. Instead if you forget the password you set you are offered the opportunity to reset it with a token that expires in two hours. This should be a satisfactorily secure method of password retrieval. We value our customers satisfaction at Bitronic Technologies. Shiinee, hopefully this is a satisfactory resolution for you and we appreciate your business.

Certified organic soap goes for between 4-7 dollars on the internet. Sure you could get some crappy chemical poison to coat your skin in for 2 dollars a bar and have acne breakouts all over your body... But who wants that? :)

I would like to sell all of these domains to the owner of blockchain.info for now they will remain suspended and pointed at our nameservers so that he can't put the sites back up.
