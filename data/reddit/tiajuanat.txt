I'm concerned that the elliptic curve encryption is in place when I distinctly remember reading a white paper that there is a backdoor to it.

It seems to me that we want to balance several things simultaneously:
* Discourage dusting
* Low/no fees for large transactions
* High enough transaction fees to have a miner network
Maybe if we had a floating transaction fee dependent on the number of bitcoins days destroyed. Miners would ping the network, get transaction data for each block and estimate an appropriate transaction fee %. Right now, we're sitting at 6-23MBTC days destroyed/day; but if we put those in a log function, that's 6.7-7.3, which lends well when calculating a percentage. Whether 6.7% or .67% of a transaction, miners will always have some scraps to keep working for.
Of course, maybe I'm just naive, but when I see 55BTC in a dusted transaction, I get the feeling that there should at least .3685btc (.67%) going to the pool/miner that processed that transaction.

Sorry about that, sources and articles included since I found a non-mobile browser.

No problem! I always appreciate sources, and felt bad when I was trapped in a mobile browser.
