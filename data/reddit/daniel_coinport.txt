I don't like 'shitcoins' either, but it's really hard to define which ones have values or penitentials. The commonly-used voting mechanism often do not reflect cryptocurrency's intrinsic value at all (if they have any). Many cryptocurrencies that won the voting were driven by their developers and early speculators. Anyway, we'll make decisions based on our own evolving principles or personal reasonings, for the good of traders, instead of driven by short-term platform interests.

Mark, sorry to know you have a withdrawal problem. We have this restrictions that a withdrawal operation cannot be performed on a coin if the balance is less than 0.01. This information is displayed corrected in our Chinese UI but is missing from the English version. We'll fix that issue.

We are sorry for our the late response to this particular issue, but we promise to take every user feedback seriously. Mark, if you would tell me your user id via email (dong77 and cc d I'd like give you some non-shitcoins for discovering this issue.
As to why we have the withdrawal restriction I mentioned previously, here is the reason - all withdrawal requests, no matter how small they are, are currently handled manually for security reason. We are still in beta after all. In the future we'll consider removing these restrictions or lowering the thresholds.
Anyway, I look forward to your return, Mark, and would like to answer any questions our beta-users may have.
- Daniel, form coinport.
