CSW is the one true King.:

You should check out Coss.io... They had a rough start last year, but with the release of COSS 1.2 this past December, which included a brand new trading engine and user interface, they are beginning to prove all the doubters wrong. COSS 1.2 has received great reviews from the community and is only the first feature release on their path to COSS 2.0. It's also proof of their tremendous efforts throughout this bear market, when so many projects flat out bailed on their promises. 
Key Features:
- COSS token holders share 50% of trading fees
- CFT token holders get 25% trading fee discounts
- One of only a handful of exchanges working tirelessly to meet regulatory requirements (based in Singapore). 
- One of only 7 exchanges with a CCXT certification.
- Very communicative, open, transparent, and engaged with the community. 
Don't just take my word for it, see for yourself: 
I certainly hope you like what you learn &amp; experience with COSS and decide to join our community, but if you still prefer to look elsewhere, Coinbase is most people's first venture into crypto &amp; Binance is most people's top choice for Alts. 
Welcome to the Crypto Revolution. Happy trading. 
Edit: 25% discounts on trading, not 15%

I agree with you. 
I haven’t been involved nearly as long as you, but I was most excited about Bitcoin’s potential to the future of economics. Its ability to revolutionize our financial &amp; political systems, which in turn would revolutionize society &amp; bring us a hint leap closer to true individual equality. 
Sadly, I knew we would likely find a way to screw it up &amp; that the powers that be would never let this happen. This day in age, most people are too stupid/ignorant to think for themselves, which may allow the powers that be to either discredit to the point of irrelevance, or worse, gain control of the Bitcoin network. 
Whatever happens, greed will be a potent ingredient in determining the outcome.

My guess is they won't launch until the SEC approves the Bitcoin ETF or at releases some sort of detailed regulatory framework for crypto.

Until the overall crypto market cap is in the trillions of dollars like other major markets, it will be subject to &amp; the victim of market manipulation by people/organizations/govts with billions or even just millions of dollars. 
Sad but true... But I do believe we will get there ����������
