I don't think we go too far like $400k, maybe something around $100k and get back to $20k, my guess lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:27:28
we have to keep in mind that this pump is because of libra, to go to 100k or above, the ETF of SEC have to be approved and new people get into on bitcoin environment

our minimum was 3,5k \~ 4k, I think when bull run ends we will back to 6\~8k I think.
but I hope I'm wrong and you are right :)

no, I thought something like I can put in my ecommerce and receive in my wallet when customer pay for something in the ecommerce
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:48:08
