I feel the same way as cleantone. I started buying when it was at ~$580. I made my first purchase two days before it went down to ~$480. I've kept buying since then. I'm doing my best not to panic but I'm at a 22% loss right now. :'(

What the hell did they do? Why are people happy about this? They make ASICs, without them there wouldn't be as many bitcoins... oh wait are you guys mad because they help inflate bitcoin?

How do you get Mario from Fung-Wong...?

Yes, but what's the algorithm for these sites to determine what people are prepared to buy and sell it for? It's not like you can type in your own buy or sell price. At least not on Coinbase.

I bought some at $382 yesterday. Out of a total of 8 purchases, that's the only one I'm currently profiting from. Yesterday was a blessed day.

Welp, I just tried to verify again. Unlike the past three times I tried, this time it actually got past the first step and went on to ask me some multiple-choice questions:
1) in which city is &lt;street I used to live at&gt;?
2) which of the following people do u know?
3) &lt;repeat question 1 with different choices&gt;
4) in which of the following counties have u lived in?
And then it failed. What the hell? I answered them all correctly... ;-;
Anyway, thanks for clearing that up! I was worried about question A primarily, I don't really mind waiting for my coins but I do want the price to be locked in.

I accept Minecraft server donations through paypal, they only take a rough average of 9% (depending on god knows what, maybe currency and/or payment method?).
You just got rekt.

Hmm I don't know. I can't afford to buy any atm. At which point does it say you can't buy?

Yeah I did that, the button was there. I wonder what the problem was with that other guy (N0o).

I thought Coinbase only operated in the U.S. o.O

If bitcoin reached $10k, I would make $3.7k profit off my roughly half a bitcoin. This kind of post makes me want to throw all my life savings at it right now.
