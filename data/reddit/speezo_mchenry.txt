Ok one thing I'm not clear on, if I'm transferring out of coinbase into paper wallet, do I "sell" it to my paper QR code? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:53
I was told to buy the dip... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:28
[MRW]( I'm waiting to buy more...
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:20:45
Gotcha, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:10:56
I wish that was true. Been waiting to buy more! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:14:10
This is great, thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:20:28
Fuck it, I say let them leak it. I'm staying so far away from spoilers that it doesn't concern me. I'd bet other fans are too. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:18:34
I am that guy waiting for the dip. But I do believe that it's coming. Maybe after a big sell off after 10,000? Maybe later? I don't know... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:01
But you don't want to sell right away.  There's no replay protection so scammers can take your BTC if you sell B2X.

FUD FTW!

The best time to buy bitcoin was 2009, the second best was 6 months ago. The third best was last week, the fourth best is now.... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:42:43
Really? That would be great &amp; might keep me from moving my very small fractional coin off coinbase if I can sell there with replay protection.
Do you have a source of this info?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:26:14
God, I keep waiting to buy more in the dip and the dip just isn't coming! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:24:29
Holy crap. Congrats to you. If it were me I'd have freaked out already and probably sold at 5000 because I'd fear a drop. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:42:44
Fuck for unlawful carnal knowledge 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:01:33
Sorry.... what's FUD?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:06:36
Fan fic? God dammit! What am I supposed to do with this boner now? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:00:35
I'm about to do the same.  Did you go web wallet, PC or offline?
I'm trying to decide...
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:38:05
Great info, thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:49:44
I'm only at step 2: Coinbase.  Is there an article or series of steps you used that you (or anyone) can point me to, to get it into a paper wallet from there?  
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:03:36


On what kind of initial investment? Or are you talking a regular (monthly or bimonthly) investment?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:59:50
This is like some king of Engrish poetry.
I love it!
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:28:39
Makes sense.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:54:00
Oh, great site! Thank you! 
@_date: 2011-05-20 15:09:11
Agreed. Seems shady. So it's a key fob camera?
