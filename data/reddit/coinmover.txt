@_date: 2019-07-12 00:49:04
Awesome advice.
My plan was to pick up the cash from our local ATM on the way there and lay it down in front of them -- then talk about the serial numbers on the dollar bills I picked up and equate them to blockchain addresses.   
For example, "See this $100 bill? That serial number is like a blockchain address - you don't know who gave it to a person and who gave it to my machine and who we give it to" --- I think it's an approach people can relate to....
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:41:30
Agreed.  Good notes, thank you.  We have a huge red sign on the face of the machine.  The interface stops you when you go to hold the wallet address up and asks you if you know who you're sending the money to, but people just tap OK and don't read.

Good about FinCEN. You're lucky. :) 
I'll be straight up honest.  The bank is the single biggest issue with running a crypto ATM business. Because depositing cash into a bank and wiring to an exchange is the only way to buy coins for market rate. Any in-person exchange or other method (credit card, etc.) charges 5% or more fees which wipes out your profit.  
The largest headache throughout this entire proccess has always been the bank(s).  
I have to run for the moment but will write more later.
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:35:02
Good for you.  Sadly, there are 60,000,000 people in the USA who are "un-banked" who don't have traditional bank accounts and can't buy online.  Remember, all BTC prices are market prices, no matter where you buy from. Coinbase or ATMs. The "market" is what the customer will pay. ;)  \*fist bump champ\*
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:19:04
No. You're not going to get rich man, not yet.  
In the beginning it takes a lot of startup costs.  What happens when someone puts $10,000 into your machine?  Will you have the BTC to send them right away?  If so, how long before you have to take that $10k and re-buy BTC to replenish the hot wallet to sell to another customer?  If you don't have $20k or $30k capital per machine in hot wallet funds, you'll always be offline and unable to help customers because you'll always be racing to machines to empty them and go to the bank and get more BTC.  
Now.... after time, it does become lucrative, but only at scale.  You need at least 10 machines, operating at about 10% fee, in order to break even and start to make money.  Then you can reduce fees to 8% and still make a little it.   Get 15 or 20 machines and you're ok.  Get 50 machines and you're great.  
But in the beginning, you will lose money had over fist.  It's not a get rich scheme.  If you want that, just buy BTC and HODL it for a while.  You're much better off. 
This business is all about on-ramps to crypto and adoption.  You have to have a passion for it, and want to see it take over the world, and want to provide people with means to get and buy crypto.  Once you have that mindset, you'll succeed.

The biggest attack vector in your scenario is a virus or malware on your computer that would be constantly looking for a 12 or 24 word seed. As soon as you connected the drive and decrypted it, the malware would snatch it up and send it off to be used ASAP. 
You should only connect that drive to a system that is NOT connected to the internet.
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:21:19
Yep. Otherwise your solution is solid. Just make sure when it’s viewable in plain text it’s isolated on a clean system.

The back end client server software automatically buys the bitcoin as it’s sold by the atm, from a major exchange via API at the time of purchase, so risk in price movement is minimized. Just need to keep enough capital funds in USD in the exchange account to cover the sales for the whole network for at least a few days, if not a week. Yes, I have run out of funds at times which means the buy couldn’t execute and now you’re losing money depending on market movement. This past week has been a wild ride and not always good.  It’s not cheap to get into and the actual profit margins are quite thin. You can see where all the fees go and associated costs here: 
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:09:05
Have them look up local bitcoin ATMs at  and find a sell machine where they can withdraw cash from a wallet, and you send to a wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-22 03:18:51
From what bank account? Are you going to use a personal account or a business account?  There isn’t a bank in the country that will open a business bank account for a crypto MSB without a 100+ page formal compliance program in place and annual revenue of of $1M+ per year.  If you use a personal account, you’ll get shut down within 90 days for making too many cash deposits. You’ll trigger red flags all over the place and they’ll suspect you of money laundering. Actually, Wells will shut you down in 30. I was being conservative with 90 days. What’s your bank account plan? 
If you do manage to get a business account you’re looking at monthly fees in the hundreds of dollars, regular compliance reviews in the hundreds of dollars, cash deposit fees for any cash deposits that sum over about $20k in a month, of course wire fees, etc. 
Then the crypto exchange won’t open a corporate account for you without a written KYC/AML program. And the name on the bank has to match the name on the crypto exchange account at Coinbase or Kraken or Gemini, etc. You can use BitAML.com and they’re awesome, but you’ll have to pay $5,000 up front for it for your compliance docs and audit.  This is literally the first thing you should be doing after registering as a MSB with FinCEN. 
....or we can forget about the bank and move on to another topic if you want.
PS. I’m not being mean or trying to pop your balloon. Just realistic and putting out there the stuff that you have to resolve before you even turn the machine on.

General Bytes just made a switch this month (August 2019) to a % based fee on all transactions.  Even when your run your own back end GB CAS. Lamassu has like a 7% market share. Genesis, the other major player with General Bytes, also charges % per transaction.

@_date: 2019-08-23 23:13:06
I have no idea.  Coinbase and Binance combined have to have at least tens of millions in hot wallets in order to support their volume and sheer number of customers.
Given the crypto marketcap in general is $300,000,000,000 (billion), I wouldn't be surprised if their joint amount across the two organizations -- and others -- meant there are at least $100,000,000 in hot wallets sitting on shared servers.  
Not out of the question at all.
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:49:24
There are bank cash deposit fees. 
Crypto exchange trading fees. 
Bitcoin withdrawal fees. 
Bank wire fees. 
Monthly cellular data network bills. 
Insurance. 
SMS/Messaging fees. 
Back end database/application server hosting costs.
KYC/AML program costs. 
... oh and don't forget the manufacturer of the machine takes a cut of all transactions too.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:02:45
I already have an account with Twilio and a company number for the regular SMS’s the machines send out to confirm each user and give receipts and notifications so that part is done. You just need the API information probably right?
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:54:20
We're registered with FinCEN as a MSB.  There's a whole BSA/AML/KYC/EDD/CIP program in place (80+ pages)  with tiers, limits, and other things to prevent laundering of money and banning of certain customers. Customer risk identification. Barring of VOIP/soft phone numbers. Running customers up against government watch lists.  The list goes on and on. The legal/compliance piece of doing it all on the up-and-up is the most complex part and the most costly.  
No, they don't take cards due to chargeback risks. Cash only. :)
"Dope money" is so 2014.  Most of our customers are using these for remittances overseas these days and personal investment purposes.  They're mostly "unbanked" (e.g., they don't have bank accounts so they can't use Coinbase, Gemini, etc.) which accounts for almost 50,000,000 people in the USA alone.
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:01:57
Forget trying to time the market.  There is a tool you can use though that will help:  Open an account at Nexo Finance ( so you can leverage your appreciating bitcoin as it goes up and withdraw USDT -- which you can use to buy more BTC.  
It also circumvents taxes as you aren't selling your BTC so you're not triggering a taxable event.  
However, do not loan over 30% of your holdings.  In a crash you don't want to have a forced liquidation.  But for your purposes, Nexo is extremely helpful in leveraging markets.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:31:10
I was thinking that too but already have the SMS infrastructure with Twilio in place as said in reply to the person above. How crazy expensive for short codes?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:53:32
That’s for a standard short code though right? I don’t necessarily need that.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:56:54
Yes, I know.  But with billions and billions moving each day, you have to have some % in hot wallets. Even 1% would be hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:45:56
I own and operate a crypto ATM business with 11 machines and more coming online each month.  You will go out of business at 5%.  Break even for this industry is about 8% to cover all costs and about 10% to make a 2% profit, which is usually reinvested in the company anyway.  
Let's start with this one, a simple question and we can expand from here:  When your ATM fills up with cash and you need to buy new crypto with that cash, how do you plan to acquire new bitcoin with the cash?
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:36:42
Maybe. All good ideas, thank you.  A few things I didn't think about.  Hmmmm....
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:50:05
I 100% agree.  But let's face it, you have Coinbase and Binance and other companies with hundreds of millions in hot wallets running on these hosted platforms.  Something must be secure enough for them to trust it, right?  
I mean...  I'm genuinely curious about how employees could access a VPS outside of a normal login I think is the question.  I'm small potatoes but worry about it.  I have a crypto company and use \~7 VPS servers for my infrastructure and only keep in the hot wallet(s) what I can afford to lose.  
This article was just striking to me that Binance actually used AWS.  Which makes sense because of load and scale, but wow.

Make sure they're sealed up tight. Ethernet inside directly to a modem to the cell network with encrypted VPN to back end servers. No Wifi. No wireless. Nothing unencrypted.  
The only attack vector is a pickup truck through the window of the store and haul it away, but if someone really wants a machine, they're better off stealing a traditional ATM -- they have more money in them at any given time.  Bitcoin ATMs are empty a lot of the time and they don't have actual coins inside them like some people think.  LOL.  I have this as part of the branding wrap on all my machines:  [

You have no idea what you're talking about.  There are bank cash deposit fees ($0.30 per $100 deposited), bank wire fees, crypto exchange trading fees ,withdrawal fees, cellular data network monthly costs.  The manufacturer takes a cut of all transactions as well. Then you have master insurance, AML program requirements, and I can go on and on and on and on.

They used to be, but that has changed.  It's now a 60/40 split of buy/sell machines in the USA.  See: [
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:23:05
The single best thing any free government (not China, but like the USA or UK) could do for crypto is to ban it. All it would do is exponentially increase adoption overnight. People want what they're told they can't have.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:55:56
Exactly.  Standard APR is 16%.  Not great.
But you can buy and stake NEXO tokens and get that reduced to 8%.  Not bad.
As long as you believe that your crypto, staked as collateral, will increase more than 8% per year, then you can't lose.
They also offer 6.5% interest -- COMPOUNDED DAILY -- on anyone who wants to stake stablecoins (USDT, etc.) with them.  You can withdraw back out at any time with no contract or limits.  They use that capital you staked in order to lend it back out to borrowers at between 8% and 16% APR interest. 
The business model is pure fucking genius.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:02:45
You don’t have to sell to realize your gains and get liquidity.  and you will have tax free cash in your bank account the next day plus retain your crypto and its associated upside potential.

See my reply above.  I own and operate a crypto ATM company.  The machines are emptied regularly and there is no need to keep a lot of cash inside them.  Whereas a traditional bank dispensing ATM is loaded up with fresh batches of $100,000 at a time on the regular, mine are emptied often.  If someone wants to steal money from an ATM, they're better off hauling away a standalone regular ATM.  I have this sign on all of mine: [
If this machine had that much in it (to fill that bag) then that's a severe error on the part of the owner/operator... they should never have that much in them, ever.
@_date: 2019-02-20 12:25:33
1.  Yes, nobody has ever thought of that. You should try working on that problem. 
2.  Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Today it goes down to a Satoshi but adding more zeroes is simply a code change so think of 21,000,000 as the entire universe. One Satoshi can eventually be a large as a whole galaxy which can then be divided 100,000,000,000 more times, if needed.  
3.  There are 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,975 private keys. I think we are good.

You can sell.  It runs a 60% buy only and 40% buy/sell machine split in the USA.  See: [
Lots of crypto ATMs sell now and will spit out money.  The key is that the 60/40 split means that people putting money in and taking it out almost balance the equation where there should never be more than like $5k or $7k in a machine at a given time.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:52:29
You're welcome. They're literally the 1% of companies that made it through the crazy ICO phase of 2018 with a working product and net profits.  Probably because they were an actual lending company before that all started  with enough flexibility and vision of the future to pivot and develop their platform.
It's crazy easy to use, so quick to disburse funds (you can get a USDT loan on your crypto collateral in less than an hour) , and they did everything formally through registering with the SEC under Reg D as a security token that they aren't on any exchanges \*yet\* -- which is why nobody hears about them.  They're paying their second profit dividend next month.
Nexo is the entire reason I have a company right now. I put up all my holdings to borrow real money to start my own crypto ATM business.  I have an office, and employees, and machines in operation today because of Nexo.

I know. You don't have to tell me -- I literally own a bitcoin company. 
I think my point is that I am just so over the top paranoid -- because that's what you need to be in this space. Paranoid about security.  
We really need to fix this situation long term otherwise true adoption will never get where we want it.  It'll be like bad customer service -- one person gets hacked and loses some money and they tell 100 of their friends and family and everyone gets a sour taste.  I know someone will come up with something in the coming years to simplify much of this and that people will eventually change as younger generations who grow up with this get older, but this whole Kraken re-brand email today really had me staring at my PC for a few solid minutes and hesitating to login (which I still haven't).

The BATMTwo uses a static hot wallet on the back end. Coins sent to your wallet will be from the same FROM wallet that is configured by the operator and won’t change unless the operator manually changes hot wallets for a specific cryptocurrency. 
For other models that allow sells, a new inbound address is generated for each transaction for you to send to the operator. 
Does that help?

Federal law, by way of FinCEN, requires that all companies that transact bitcoin be registered as a money service business on the federal and adhere to strict guidelines for BSA, AML, KYC, PATRIOT Act, OFAC Screening, etc. This applies to all fifty states. Separately states can enact tough regulations (like BitLicense in NY) or none (like PA just confirmed isn’t required) but that doesn’t eliminate obligations to FinCEN.

People vastly underestimate the audience and power of 60 Minutes. 
“Last season, 60 Minutes made Nielsen's weekly Top 10 List 22 times – 9 of them at  or better. The broadcast drew an average of 11.4 million viewers, double the audience of its nearest network news magazine competitor and over three million viewers ahead of the most-watched daily network evening news program.
The average audience for a 60 Minutes broadcast is 150 percent higher than those of the network morning news programs, a figure that still dwarfs the biggest audiences on cable news. " 
So basically 60 Minutes reaches wider audience than everyone who ever watches any cable news (Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN) all combined -- times 5.
