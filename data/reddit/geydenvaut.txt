We can call him names all you want, BTC needs privacy so fungbilty is not an issue
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:21:44

@_date: 2019-07-13 13:27:43
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:29:37
No chance.
@_date: 2019-07-13 08:03:31
Why? Training others increases understanding and leads to adoption
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:20:58
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:30:24

It's all I think and talk about
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:53:18
Prediction, you have no clue.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:37:06
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:45:02
I don't get it
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:49:47
Yeah upvoted
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:09:29
What about Binance?
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:23:26
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:34:32
Stop fucking around and buy some BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:07:34
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:19:07
Ovs a scam
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:27:33
Gloating just proves my above statement. No offense.
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:42:00
And most people stilll don't have a clue
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:21:04
Good feedback

@_date: 2019-04-26 01:29:34
Thanks, appreciate the share
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:51:05
Beyond pathetic.
Ive never seen somethings so awkward, cringe and downright scamy in my life.
Davinchi and MM Crypto should release public apologies immediately for being involved in it.
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:01:02
Don't fall for this nonse.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:48:28
Video links to see train wreak?
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:30:44
Best interview I've seen in a long time - thanks
@_date: 2019-09-10 00:11:01
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:13:33
@_date: 2019-09-09 22:14:34
Where can I get something like this for my seeds?
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:33:19
Playing the long game, I like it
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:20:03
No, Nathan Hague the guy they are writing about wasn't "flagged" - hes used to have a video about it's been taken down now.
And it's besides the point the law says they can choose anyone they want, it doesn't say "only those who are flagged."
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:11:10
Wrong, it's happening.
@_date: 2019-09-08 06:59:58
Sounds interesting. 
Do tell us more.
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:05:08
Be careful not to make it to complex.
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:32:57
So now the governments can go through your social media and pick up "key words" and detain you?! 
What is this a modern day 'minority report'.
@_date: 2019-09-21 03:07:58
Don't swap them for alts.
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:09:57
Helpful, thanks
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:57:37
Yes many zeros after a 1.
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:12:56
You need to chill. Things are happening.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:06:31
What's up with the downvotes? It's a legit question
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:00:37
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:25:37
What you think has no effect on price sir.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:13:58
I garureentee his ALL IN like most of us haha
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:38:13
I don't get the whole jinxing thing.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:15:31
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:35:05
Pls explain?
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:44:19
Yeah, saw that after I commented. Agree.
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:00:32
Very cringe
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:44:24
Correct, many of us don't know until it's to late. So take money of the table as you go. Don't get greedy.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:42:40
Zero fucks given
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:42:06
Because mark z is everything crypto is NOT.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:37:54
Agree with all except- XRP.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:53:51
28K is my guess, I hope I'm wrong and it's much higher
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:19:08
Sold the bottom?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:08:32
Just a dude
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:45:21
Yeah right
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:18:50
I say, fuck it. Why not.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:57:41
This is an ATH video for me. But I'll take it
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:25:44
And this is why you will win, nible in a market that requires it. Speed boat VS the titanic.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:32:12
If you held during the bear, you'll be patient in the bull.
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:22:52
No, go work for it like the rest of us.
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:40:01
Corrected, but many still do.
And as mentioned it's a gateway into crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:41:36
So good
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:08:51
Will do xx
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:08:46

@_date: 2019-05-18 09:03:50
Early days
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:39:05
Fuck no man.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:59:44
35k I think
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:29:12
Fuck I hope so!
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:24:03
Seriously let's not give this fool the attention he desires.
