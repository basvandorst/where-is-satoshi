Yeah it’s been a bit of a hassle for me now with the new payment protocol on iOS mobile since breadwallet doesn’t recognize it and won’t scan the qr code either so I’ve had to copy the invoice link, pastebin it, then go to my computer and open the invoice there so I can use electrum to pay.

They use Touch ID so I assume they are talking about an iPhone, if it was an android then a virus would be my first guess for sure.

If the majority of the people using/mining bitcoin wanted that oh so “superior” tech then it can be added.
