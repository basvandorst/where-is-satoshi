The deftness with which you disparage not only a noble prize winner who accomplished more by the age of 25 than you are likely to in your entire life, but also an entire field of study, is simply astounding.


Right, economics has no notion of demand. /s

My not recognizing Austrian economics has nothing to do with the inane "criticism" the above commenter offered.  In fact, he seems to have thrown out *all* economics, simply because he took an introductory course and decided that was "enough."  Sorry if I don't respect a self-professed Luddite's view of an immensely complicated topic.

That's reddit (and people in general) for you.  In my opinion, as long as a question isn't loaded on purpose, not a single fucker should give it a downvote.

Nice!  Maybe we can get someone with 3 years to weigh in?

If you got 24 karma and the comment above got 16 karma, by my calculation 40% of people are hair brained dipshits.
