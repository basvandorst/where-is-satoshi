I feel like this is different from 2016 because we actively seek other media sources. If the dnc pulls their super delegate steam roll shit again, people will throw their vote away for another 4 years of trump.

Nice! I logged on and saw that they enabled withdrawals and deposits now. I have been using cash app to buy and withdraw, now that I know I can deposit I’m stoked. Thanks guys!

Ehhh I bought a large chunk of my eth near ath. I think that’s one of the few alts that will recover.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:17:55
Haha true dat! Move that ish.

They’re separating US users from their platform to a binance US platform because they’re going to Margin trading.

I haven't bought on coinbase in a while but he can't move that BTC until the funds are confirmed from his bank can he?

Excuse me WHAT *runs shamelessly back to cashapp*
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:53:55
This was my line of thinking as well. I was fortunate enough to average buy down after getting in VERY late in feb 2018 so I missed the ath and rektoning. I think 17-18k sell off will depend on how fast it breaks through.  If there’s major resistance I think that’s where people panic.

Nearly 13 even! Was a sleepless night for me lol.

I really like my trezor, I use a few different wallets and that one is my favorite.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:59:54
Personally, I invested weekly 6k and under, biweekly 7-8k and now I’m back to small amounts weekly while I intra trade.

It really is. This is either the most beautiful parabolic thing I’ve ever seen or the biggest trap �� I keep waiting every s/r level looking for a violent rejection and fricken nada

This close is looking like it may be a pretty significant big Shadow on the hourly and 4H.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:16:37
Oh hey, it hit.

Kraken is dope! I'm transferring that way as well after the whole binance debacle

He’s been to a few crypto conferences as well. One of the only candidates that knows what blockchain tech is.

I already broke even lol. I didn’t get into bitcoin until after the bull run. My first buy was at 7k

Just remember, nothing in life is free. You'll end up paying for it one way or the other. You're KYC on coinbase, they'll either overdraft your account (which you may be able to pay back if you cash in your btc or until you get paid) or they'll revoke that btc if you don't move it. Remember, it's not yours if it's not in your wallet.

Keep the hopium coming
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:24:38
Accurate af  
Edit: One of my friends sent me a message saying "Okay get ready for 6k" ....Sir.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:07:58
I like cashapp, you just can't move your btc from it to a wallet or you can't put it back on there.  
Edit:  apparently you can now! Stoked.

10pm for me. I have a feeling I’m not sleeping lol!  I have 13.7-14 marked as a potential area for a rest. This is nuts though. Just praying wherever it stops I have a chance to make a decision before a f*ck off candle crash lol
