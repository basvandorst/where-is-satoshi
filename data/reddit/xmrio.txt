Why is the lightning network not being adopted en masse right NOW?
With the amount of money in Bitcoin I would expect to hear numerous dev teams working together to quickly create UI / infrastructure and to get this thing out there. It's vital if Bitcoin stands any chance of scaling, and without it BTC is at risk of being usurped by ETH.
Where is the sense of urgency?

The quicker an infrastructure is developed the closer it is to being audited (and anyway most of the work needing to be done is UI and adoption)

Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless platform in which you don't invest more than you're willing to lose and any mistakes you make fall on your own shoulders.
Certainly you have no legal obligation to pay him back. In my opinion, you have no moral obligation either. 
The number one decider of a person's wealth in this world is the circumstances they were born into -- AKA something they have no control over. If you were born into (small) fortune you wouldn't even consider giving it away to some random nobody. To me you're just as deserving of this as anyone.

Ethereum has dramatically risen over the past month and you show a guy breaking his leg. I'll never understand the expectations of crypto traders...

Why does this Bitcoin subreddit seem to be focused toward Bitcoin Cash?

Okay, this is going to be unpopular with you people, but it needs to be said and it's difficult to put into words: **Version one is incredibly, incredibly alienating to a very large group of people.**
Like, in a puke-in-your-mouth sort of way.
With how split things are in the world right now, we desperately need to communicate that Bitcoin is a utility available to everyone, equally, with no agenda to push. Yet version one is blatantly pushing politics. You can deny it all you want, but in one glance we can all see that the image screams "all bodies are beautiful" and "I'd bet you can't tell what gender I am."
The level of sterility and lameness these people exude is actually off-putting in a stomach-turning kind of way. And now I think I've decided for sure never to wear a t-shirt with the bitcoin logo plastered across the chest and not much else going on with it. These figures are most unnaturally confined to fit in the narrow lens of a politically correct camera, so much so that one lady is force-propelling herself to keep balance on one foot, though it is clearly far-right her center of gravity.
You may think I'm kidding, you may think I'm wildly overreaching, but I guarantee I'm not alone. Keep in mind I say this as Apple is suddenly receiving a torrent of backlash for their snarky "What's a computer?" ad, something that probably would have flown under the radar as just-another-progressive-ad just a couple years ago. Just... trust me. If this image is supposed to be inclusive, it is accomplishing the exact opposite of this.

How does he have a moral obligation to return the money? Why is the other person more entitled to the money than he is?

I was referring to It seems like a Bitcoin subreddit no? BTC is the ticker for bitcoin...

I'm not sold on the idea that a "mesh" pattern is scalable.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:26:21
Let's get one thing straight: It is his money. If he chooses to return it, that's a decision he's entitled to, as is the choice of keeping it. 
As to whether he's morally entitled to the latter option I'd argue that the circumstances of how he obtained the money are no different than how many of us on this site were born into relative wealth compared to other parts of the world, and most of us don't think twice about keeping our money as opposed to shipping it to Africa.

Allot of these were just criticisms of the technology at the time they were spoken/written, not predictions for the future.
What purpose did the average family have for a personal computer in 1977?

Spot on. It reminds me of something I learned in school in America. There were no term limits on presidencies at first, and George Washington, being deified as he was, probably could have stayed president as long as he liked. But he knew better than the people who deified him how imperfect a person he was, so he stepped down after his second term, and instead asked people to put their trust in the constitution and its underlying values. 
I like to think Satoshi had a similar thought process.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:54:10
This is just another reminder that Satoshi's absence is one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths. Wherever you are, thank you Satoshi.

This is an unpopular opinion but you need to stop saying this is not ok. I am completely against Bcash, but it is as legitimate a fork of the original BTC chain as the Segwit chain is. Sure it may not have much of a future, and of course it is manipulated, but it has the same rights to the Bitcoin name as we do.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:36:16
Sorry, but you're factually wrong. Segwit was a protocal change in the same way Bitcoin Cash changed its protocol. Neither follow the same protocol, and as far as which chain is the longest, that's BCash.
I'd assume most of reddit doesn't know these things, because most of reddit wasn't even a member of the Bitcoin community during the fork. But please, before you bring up the block height argument again, know that it just exposes you as uninformed.
