By "public acceptance" they really mean "bank acceptance" because the big banks don't want to be near anything with regulatory uncertainty. If they are going to deal with Bitcoin, they want to do it on their own terms.

This doesn't come as much of a surprise to most people, especially the cynical and skeptical among us, but it also goes to show how badly the Bitcoin Foundation has failed.
Tons of time, energy and funds dedicated to swaying the position of these regulators, and jack shit to show for it. Jim Harper's salary has proven useless thus far. Their expensive lobbying efforts have proven totally ineffective.
And now the Foundation hopes to bring its failed lobbying practices to Washington DC by hiring the same crafty lobbying group that helped pass the DMCA and Patriot Act. The same group (Thorsen &amp; French) that takes massive payments from Comcast, big pharma, Western Union (!) and other large corporations in exchange for DC influence.
Is this what Bitcoin's political impact has boiled down to? Paying large sums ($100,000+) for the ears of regulators and legislators who will just as quickly stab you in the back when they get a fatter check from someone else?
The Foundation is inherently corrupt at its very core, and its actions and expenditures show it. Most of us knew Ben Lawsky wouldn't give a shit about us in the end, but it's still surprising how long the Bitcoin Foundation would continue this expensive charade of "lobbying gets results." No, it doesn't. It's just a colossal waste of the membership dues that Bitcoin companies pay to the Foundation in good faith.

HSBC essentially settled out of court for $1.9 billion, meaning they never had to admit guilt or wrongdoing. It also doesn't set any precedent of law, besides the fact that rich corporations have the ability to bribe the government into dropping lawsuits like that.

PayPal itself isn't integrating Bitcoin at all, at least not yet. They are just enabling online merchants who use the Braintree app (75,000 I think, but could be wrong) to opt in to bitcoin payments. But they have to set up their own wallet with Coinbase; PayPal doesn't do it for them.
That said, PayPal also made a new (weird) promo ad on YouTube that seems to be pretty supportive of the *potential* of bitcoin. And they also announced the Braintree acceptance as "PayPal's first foray into bitcoin."
So, not much right now, but really really overt hints about deeper integration in the future. I think we might see actual bitcoin wallets added to PayPal within the next year.

It depends on how they do it. If the government starts buying up loads of BTC to distribute to the people peacefully, the price would rise. Speculators would also jump in the pile because of perceived legitimacy, so there's another rise in price.
On the other hand, if the government forces people to buy BTC at the point of a gun, the experiment won't work out too well. You can't force people to adopt something and expect there not to be bloodshed, scandal and international criticism. In that scenario, the price would plummet in the short term.

I wonder how they came up with that number, and whether the same method could be used to gauge adoption in other countries.

The fee comes from Mastercard, not Google, since it's the same fee applied to all cards. There would be no fee if Google provided a corresponding bank account (with routing &amp; account number) that can link to Circle.
Still, this is pretty cool. I recently got my own Google Wallet card to experiment with, and it seems pretty legit considering they don't charge a monthly $5 fee for the card itself.

Also, you don't feel as heavily invested if you're earning bitcoin instead of buying it, at least in my experience.

I don't think that's necessarily true, unless you have multiple studies to back it up. People who are willing to commit crimes for money are going to do it regardless of how "hard" it is because they've been doing it for decades and there's always a way. Bitcoin is just the *new* way. Tightening the govt regs around Bitcoin won't prevent people from getting defrauded or robbed, it will just hand more unwarranted oversight abilities to the state.
And let's not forget that when the govt wants to go after "money laundering" it's almost always relating to the drug trade -- NOT thefts and fraud. Money laundering laws are largely a weapon in the war on drugs.

At this point in its evolution, Bitcoin doesn't need more places to spend it (seriously, that area has been covered in 2014), what it really needs are innovative features that simply aren't available on other payment platforms.
Did PayPal / Braintree implement multi-sig to allow groups to manage funds? What about using BTC as micro-bidding on eBay?
No, it's just opening up bitcoin acceptance to a few thousand more merchants, who have to opt in, and most of whom will not keep BTC, instead electing to have Coinbase sell it for fiat.
This PayPal news isn't as big a deal as the community and media are playing it up to be.

I'm not sure if self-management would actually solve those problems, I'm just saying government regulation clearly **didn't** solve them.
People need to get out of that state of mind where they abdicate all personal responsibility to some "other" entity -- the schools, the government, and in some cases even corporations.
If people in CA and WV were more willing to get directly involved in community issues, they would actually organize productive action against the people who are poisoning the water -- instead of relying on inefficient and corrupt governments to do that job.

It's not even that. The pictures aren't actually disappeared because it's easy for the recipient to take a permanent screenshot, and I'm pretty sure the NSA/GCHQ have a copy as well.
It's just a nifty, yet simple, implementation of picture sharing that went viral and caught a ton of buzz. The "value" placed on it by inflated stock market investors should not be equated to its **real** value for humanity.
And besides, give the app industry another couple years (or less) and we'll have "disappearing" pics as just one feature of a hundred, all in the same app that can probably edit photos too.

It's like Kickstarter, except the project creators only get the money if a pre-detetermined amount is reached (which I think is an option at Kickstarter/Indiegogo, but Lighthouse is a decentralized version of that).
Basically a bunch of people sign an incomplete transaction saying they will donate once the total amount of donations is reached. Once that happens, the transaction automatically broadcasts to the network and the project creator gets all the coins.
Check out [this article]( I wrote about the subject.

The ethereum people set a price for the ether (which actually increased as time went on, to incentivise early funding) and a certain amount of people paid that price for it. Simple free market economics.

It's ridiculously easy to spend bitcoin on Amazon by going through Gyft, and they give you 3% points back as well (thought most people knew this?).

If you store bitcoin locally, an attacker needs both the wallet file *and* your encryption password. And if you use multisig, they need two of your devices as well.
But yeah, I see your point. Careless people will fall for traps no matter what system they use. This is why personal education and responsibility are paramount in the digital age.

Water safety is STILL an issue despite heavy government regulation. California farmers have been relying more on groundwater this year due to drought, but unfortunately much of the groundwater is poisoned due to oil fracking. How's that regulation working out?
And then of course there's that entire county in West Virginia that had its water supply poisoned by a oil company that was based *upstream* next to the river and continuously dumped waste into the water.
Actively engaged communities would be much better at managing their own water supply than leaving it up to government regulators and corporations.

This is a huge coup for the credit card companies, and why they're giving Apple a nice kickback. Basically it's as frictionless and secure as the credit card system is going to get, and the companies are hoping Apple Pay cements their status in the new digital economy.
As for security, Apple claims that everything stays on the device, is encrypted, and isn't transmitted to merchants as their actual info - rather, a jumbled one-time string that might prevent another Target fiasco. Another reason the credit card companies are banking big on this - they don't want to deal with that hacking crap (on a mass scale) any longer.
That said, I think Apple Pay will start getting compromised on the level of the individual user. It will start with people who use simple passwords (you might as well use no encryption at all) and then it will expand to others who fall for phishing attacks, and so on. I'm sure hackers will come up with other ingenious schemes, because Apple Pay users are going to be a huge target.

Ethereum will be the best platform for doing the kind of stuff you imagine. DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) will be able to self-manage and, to a large extent, ignore the whims of humans entirely. Devs can program it with whatever rules they want, and if people decide to buy into the DAO, those rules get implemented automatically with virtually no overhead costs.
The problem with pushing this as a replacement to government is that the govt very much doesn't want to be replaced. They like what they have going, they like the power they have, and they like getting paid fat salaries for doing almost nothing useful to society. They will be very hostile toward DAOs that render govt obsolete.
Another problem is that you can't force anyone to join a DAO, or else you're no better than the govt you're trying to replace. Given the voluntarism required to get people to buy into stuff like this, I think the growth of DAOs will be even slower than the growth of Bitcoin. But who knows, this is really *really* uncharted territory and anything can happen.

I bought $10 worth about an hour ago, but I haven't been able to withdraw it to an external wallet. "Sending" BTC requires a verification code sent to my phone, which takes almost 5 minutes today for some reason. Then when I finally enter the code, they tell me the BTC price has "changed too much" during that time and I need to restart the process. What the hell? The price was actually flat at $300 during that time, and even if it *had* changed a lot, why should it matter if I'm just withdrawing BTC that I already purchased? Bad experience with Circle today.
Edit: The code finally worked, after about 5 tries.
