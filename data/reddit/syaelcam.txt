Closer to 2141 I think
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:19:39
We are at the moooooonn, to jupiterrrrrrr!

People that "need to live, pay their loans and mortgage" should not have that money in a highly volatile investment.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:14:32
They have ads? :P
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:31:58
Internationals can pay with bitcoin, send it to a shipito warehouse then pay for shipping from there in bitcoin!!!

If wasn't part of a pool he will either have 50 or nothing if he mined for less than 10 mins. 
@_date: 2012-04-02 11:16:14
Last line cracked me up.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:30:41
So you are taking one persons opinion as fact? 
@_date: 2013-03-18 03:50:33
[Here you go!](
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:14:13
Why send the btc to a mtgox wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:59:29
CampBX represent, haha
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:39:46
But will it crash? or when will you buy in? 200? 300? 400?
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:35:11
Rephrase, did you accept the ToS?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:38:28
See, international trade, accelerated by internet.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:21:32
You have a quite optimistic hash rate increase in there I believe. I would go for something a bit more worst case.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:27:34
Did you even read?
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:56:17
designed to does not necessarily mean it has to reach that value. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 02:45:23
I would say either 70 or 80$ given our previous barriers.
@_date: 2013-03-05 23:42:47
I didn't have funds to get in at 2$ , what does that make me :(
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:43:06
@_date: 2013-06-12 08:58:26
no we do not hate BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:37:33
I had a rage at that post last night, was not a good way to go to bed.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:20:35
Did you send the transfer with a fee? If not, it can take quite a while to get 6+ confirms.
@_date: 2013-05-16 08:05:05
Yes, but you weren't asked to disclose that on a legal document, were you?
@_date: 2013-07-08 10:38:30
I think that is his point. Then go onto his next line where he mentions the need for other supporting services. Yes, I know you can buy those things in various shapes and forms already but needs to be more widespread. And that is the catch-22.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:30:29
Avoid what? Tell me what I'm missing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:56
money is waitinggg to buy
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:36:45
The deciding factor would probably be risk, is he more likely to receive the physical product from a reputable seller or the electronic product from a startup? Yes I realise someone selling Bitcoin hardware is most likely a startup as well but they may have previous track record on eBay/other sales sites.
@_date: 2013-03-09 11:26:18
Sleuth. ^^
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:17:40
Well imo Blackberry is making a comeback, rather trying to.
@_date: 2013-09-09 06:38:20
so they just might be really good at scamming people.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:08:38
I dunno about you but I intend to live forever, so far, so good.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:31:16
Why sell on ebay? "quicker" access for your fiat?
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:13:35
Did you read the ToS?
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:23:02
Come on people, that third point shouldn't be in his list! Get off mtgox!
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:51:19
It needs a space between it and the line above it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:22:40
If he just chose 20$ more he would be so much better off haha.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:37:22
why not sell on an exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:04:55
That's a bit high don't you think ;D
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:34:57
Just wait, and bide your time.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:53:56
I read up until they said the majority of coins will be mined by 2040 and stopped. When they start getting their facts right I will start reading mainstream media again.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:25:44
Calling $US9000 as the next trigger!
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:27:46
You should look at the Eve online subreddit, Russian hate abound.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:14:07
I haven't seen it before.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:30:50
True. Well, see how bad it can get :P haha
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:57:11
Why would it have to be the government? Why not a private bank? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:50:38
Awww yeaaAHHH
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:56:22
Maybe satoshi set it up so all the clues would lead would be sleuths to reiter. Fairly simple deception I would think.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:08:19
If you submit a ticket for 2fa reset they will ask you how much your last transaction was and remove the 2fa.
@_date: 2013-08-19 23:53:47
But the value at the other exchanges isn't one dollar, it's 100 dollars.
@_date: 2013-03-20 07:26:03
tis not a good feeling. I know from experience.
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:02:05
Or kept getting interrupted.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:03:07
That lady, please, ugh. I'm sending an email.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:41:21
Your coins could still be waiting for confirms then. How long ago did u make the transfer?
