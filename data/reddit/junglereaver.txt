This is the kind of stuff that pushes me over the edge into ownership. Thank you :)

do you really think they could get that valuable?

youre right, Id hate to see them turn into some serious money later, when I dont necessarily need it right now. 
Maybe this can be my little retirement-like investment, even while the price is so unstable, its nice to see that its climbed. 
in the end I will have lost nothing.

excellent points.
I got into it with the mindset of, "well, I bought this computer for bitcoin mining, but if it doesnt work out, atleast I have a computer"
so im not terribly attached to the idea of them getting big or going bust, but obviously id like to see this intangible series of digits on my computer turn into some bigger $ and lots more zero's down the road. Holding on to them would make a lot of sense. I definitely didnt expect them to get so valuable so quickly.

that looks like a cool sub!

well, I admit I havent been paying attention to the BTC news, just watching the prices occasionally, so I have no idea what people are saying to do.
