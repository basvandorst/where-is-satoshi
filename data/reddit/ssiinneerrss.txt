Nope, that point is what I like to call crypto nirvana.  It is the only moment in which you feel at absolute peace with Bitcoin.  It is an amazing thing.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:37:59
Good point.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:41:22
I've been hodling for almost a year now, and yes, eventually, the day will come where you have to say fuck it if you want to stay mentally sane.  
One thing I tell myself too, is that there are so many out there in the same boat as all of us, we all go down together.

Ledger nano S. 
You’re welcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:46:57
Just move your BTC to bread wallet iOS app, format to check seed, then transfer back. Ez pz 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:39:27
That is definitely some 14 year old "hacker".
Make the 1% penniless?  Are you literally retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:58:05
It’s sleek but from far away it doesn’t say BTC enough, in my opinion. Should be able to see the B at a glance from any distance. That’s just good design if you ask me.

Check out r/wallstreetbets.
Wholesome community and love helping noobs out.
By the way, don’t try to trade your coin if you aren’t an experienced trader already.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:12:28
Can’t you convert it to Monero and then sell it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:14:48
You and about 256k other people it seems like. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:56:28
Just so you know.. capitalize your “i’s”.. kind of hard to take your site seriously. 
As for the logo, make the b stand out more!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:51
How large of a withdrawal? Maybe they were picking and choosing based on payout size. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:14:37
I completely disagree with you about TA.
I have based EVERY single one of my trades on TA.  It is *extremely* useful information that gives you an upperhand over people that don't look at charts at all.
Simple indicators like Bollinger Bands and Stochastic RSI can show you easily whether the coin is oversold or bought.  
It's not luck when I place trend lines that are followed for 6 months without me moving them.
TA is very useful noobs, study the basics and it will give you an edge.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:44:52
Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:16:53
God damnit...
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:45
Wow, I didn't know it was today. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:01:38
We found the 50 year old.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:25:53
Thing is... I don't think it is just yet, I think 2018 is they year for BTC mania.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:18:43
How do you plan on dodging the taxes...?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:24:16
whoa whoa whoa...
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:34:01
“Dip” 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:48:53
Duuuuude. Hahahaha, you aren’t a fucking mutant lol
@_date: 2018-08-02 11:56:09
No, it comes down to lack of education on cryptos. Someone might think it is a secure process. Seems silly, but crypto is a world of its own right now. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:45:03
It isn't their job to care, nor should it be, it is ours as investors to DYOR.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 01:48:48
So fucking lame, literal terrorism.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:25:58
Litecoin atomic swap will solve this. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:40:41
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:34:19
Also doesn't take in to account the fact that you will never find a substantial amount of pennies to make it worthwhile at all.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:58:25
Welcome to cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:45:39
This is the most I have genuinely laughed in a while.  Whoever created this is a genius.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:48:50
Not much of a problem.  Many solutions being made/researched to deal with this.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:00:38
Literally instants transactions and conversion in to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:32:55
I'm pretty sure the title is just photoshopped.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:38:58
Nope, it's going straight to $0. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:44:03
The reason it isn't stable is due to it being taken seriously in a new market.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:48:01
So you say health is the greatest wealth, yet you are a smoker?
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:47:08
It's a currency, but it is an undervalued currency.  Which is why many are using it as a form of investment. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:02:59
Dumps price of BCH, and boosts price of BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:51:58
But who really made off with the large bags in the end..
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:06:20
That's pretty typical. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:14:55
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:06:17
Yeah totally, he had time for an explanation and to download an app and have it sent and all of that! 
Fuck off you stupid cunt.  You really take some of us for idiots don’t you? 
@_date: 2018-07-28 06:31:01
It also further legitimizes BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:33:21
Alright Mr. "Health is the greatest wealth"
@_date: 2018-07-25 08:35:33
TTD 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:10:20
You don't have much character if you say things like that yet still smoke.
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:39:53
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:21:42
can you supply some sort of proof to back up these claims?
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:34:47
Part of it is ledgers fault, they could have capped purchases per customer.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:30:46
"T" meaning...
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:18:32
Some assholes bought up every single one and put it on Amazon and eBay for huge profit. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:22:56
So you're telling me your problem is lack of inventory?
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:14:25
Were you born fucking yesterday? Do you not know how common it is lol
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:00:00
Why don't they just purchase $210k worth of BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:51:58
Extremely tacky.
