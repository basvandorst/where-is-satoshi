I know they will add support for Bitcoin Cash in early 2018, don’t know about any others.

There is a saying with stocks that if your cab driver recommends a stock you own it is time to sell (implying the hype is reaching maximum levels).

Technical analysis

It’s extreme rise messed with the psychology of many.
On this subreddit earlier in the year 10k was the moon and seemed like it would be hard to reach.
When the price blew straight through it expectations changed, all the sudden it seemed like it would never be below 10k.
With a 1000+ altcoins and continued forks I think the idea of a finite number of coins has been weakened. 
Also reading this and other subreddits it is clear that most people were just assuming the price will continue to skyrocket. 
Good luck to all, just keep in mind why you got in to begin with and what you hoped the price would reach. If you got in over 10k you are obviously going to have different expectations to someone who got in sub 1k.

The talk about freeing people from the state seems extreme. Has anyone seen what happens in areas without a functioning government? It ain’t pretty.

Money would just be printed which would cause inflation, much easier.

I don’t know about interac but maybe they can get you the info for the seller.
Remember to treat people as you would like to be treated.

So giant solar farms will be built to deal with the exponentially more difficult blocks? How will those solar farms compete with cheap coal energy?

And you never make a profit unless you sell.
