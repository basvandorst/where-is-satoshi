Until today morning inhabe in both camps BTC/BCH. 
Started a transfer from KuCoin to Binance at 7:40am German time..
Now it‘s 16:00 and my transaction is still nor processed but did cost 20€... this makes me more then just angry.
BTC can‘t ever be a currency.. neither BTC nor BCrash. They are noth dinosaurs....

You really think Coinbase cares about this? They just told Roger and Jihan on which date they would start the trading.
So they can start pumpin...

Guess i would do exactly the same, if i would be in their position. In the End it‘s all about Purchasing Power, or Power in general.
No matter how the currency is called.

That tells me that 35k BTC is enough to trigger other‘s to sell their BTC aswell „and buy back lower“

It is not about crypto.
They choose 7 leaders from their party.
Since 5/7 current leader won‘t participate anymore
There is some tension...

Yet again another FUD Thread with false information.

I just wanted to state he fact, that it is not *every* $.
Because a lot of early adopters Cash out into Fiat.

I disagree on the part: „the money is not stored in banks anymore“ for a simple reason.
Bitcoin is still traded for $/€ and the like.
So somebody in the world is receiving this FIAT money. And a very good portion of that is beeing drawn out of the Bitcoin Ecosystem into the Early Adopters Bank Accounts to buy Lambo‘s or parts of the Moon...
I think Mr. Dimon is afraid of the potential to loose the entire banking power once people stop changing BTC-&gt;FIAT-&gt; random good but go directly for BTC-&gt; random good.
Once FIAT is out of the middle he should better own some Bitcoin himself or ask Roger Ver for a new Job.
Just my 2 Satoshi

Actually it took back the gains of 1 1/2 months, not 5.5 years.
