Hi ^^^
So far I buy with cash from friend.  He buy exchange but 1% fee to leave  exchange for RMB so he likes to sell in person when we can.  He owns bitcoins for long time so more happy to sell.  I think instant or 1 day wait--not long time. Also can buy in person at places like bitcoin cafe in Beijing.  Sorry not sure but hope this helps!

你好!  Its funny, only foreigners add "ma" to greeting.  Chinese do not use this for greeting like that.

Yes, my coworker talked to me about after he saw clip on TV 3 months past.  At first I dont believe, but bought small amount in case as not many good investments in China.  Read much much more to learn about it and now believe bitcoins.  Also much more happy to own now that US almost decide not to pay debt and might decide not to in future.
