If anyone was convinced not to buy BTC because of this guy, they were never gonna HODL anyways

So it’s for all users now?

Stop being a little bitch. If you figure out how to get a Litecoin wallet I’ll send you $25 so you have some skin in the game. Post an address in a hour or less.

Holy shit, shout out to Craig

Ok redditor for one week
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:08:08
Bye Felicia 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:57:53
What is your source saying now?
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:05:08
It’s a funny story to tell, I still keep it around so I can remind myself not to waste money on stupid stuff
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:36:35
But what does it mean
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:20:29
Not as bad as the time I spent 2 BTC on a hoverboard
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:32:14
*Almost* as good as Roger Ver trained you to spread FUD
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:30:35
Thanks redditor for 5 days
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:13:02
Protect your keys bro

My source said your source is a hoe

Back to? You've been here less than 21 days

I always wanted to be part of a meme-birth... I wonder what we'll call you... 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:41:59
true, some explorers are less accurate than others I guess... will this be your last time using BTC or do you think it's worth the wait?
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:38:46
Zerohedge = ��

Thanks Yahoo

Why don’t you make a podcast about it since you’re such an expert?
Comparing her to Andreas, who has done hundreds of public speaking engagements is pathetic. She’s a builder, she talks like an engineer, and would probably take it as a compliment if you didn’t call her a “thought leader” meme.

A fool and his BTC are soon departed.
Do you think you made a good impression to the people around you who've probably never heard of Bitcoin? Think before you put on your Bitcoin hat and start advocating for us... and check out the Shift card by Coinbase if you want to spend
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:33:35
And what exactly is her weakness?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:13:11
Look at the account of the person who tweeted that.

Buy some for a young relative. Worst case, they get some digital beanie babies, best case they get to learn about how money works and what qualities make it valuable. The kids are the future!
@_date: 2017-05-20 03:08:35
what is monero's answer to scalability? I bet those ring signatures aren't making transactions any lighter right?
Also does monero have inflation?

Name calling isn't a good persuasion technique

They make money by taking a commission off of smart contract transactions. So if nobody uses it, they don't make that much money.

You can't do **inside** trading in a market that is ***outside*** the regulatory markets, you buffoon.
