Plausible circumstance?
1. Lets say people use the system for fraud, money laundering, to hide or to purchase illegal things (child porn, drugs, poker sites, etc.) the authorities will take interest and do their best to shut it down. 
Politicians won't have to answer for anything as it will be the Justice department enforcing existing laws.  
 Bitcoin will be harder to shut down as it is decentralized and the transactions happen between private entities. But the authorities can shut down the Exchange sites making it harder to convert the coins into cash. Everyone tries to sell at the same time and everything hits the shitter. 
2. If the system were to be hacked bitcoins were able to be created at will. People lose confidence, pull out and everything hits the shitter. 
3. If this turns out to be completely legal. Google gets involved and everyone cashes out of bitcoin en mass and BC hits the shitter. 
 
Bitcoin has a different model that the failed E-gold but there are some lessons to be learned.

Where can I place a put on a year old virtual currency?  
Any way. I feel confident it will appreciate in value in the short term because of it's rising popularity.

Bitcoin is going to be a bubble that will pop. Question is: When?

Every bubble that has existed at one time was thought to be "well crafted."
   Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It only has value because people believe it has value. The value is increasing only because more money is being put into the system.  When people en masse want to pull money out of the system value will hit the shitter quick. 
   With that being said I think creating a currency and charging a Fee on every transaction is a good way to get really really rich. 
   As it increases in popularity the US government will definitely get involved. They aren't big fans of anonymous money moving around.
