"Many cryptocurrencies are murky, overhyped and vulnerable to crashes. The market desperately needs the clarity that only robust, impartial ratings can provide. We’re proud to be the first to bring that benefit to investors — to help them cut through the hype and identify the few truly solid cryptocurrencies. Our ratings are based on hard data and objective analysis. But they’re bound to create controversy, including some grades that may come as a surprise to some people."

Good for BTC and other serious cryptos - will the alt money start coming back to viable assets like BtC??

"Taleb says bitcoin has advantages over assets like gold futures because it doesn’t require a specific custodian or intermediary.
It isn’t the first time the professor has sounded off about bitcoin and its ilk. Last year, he cautioned that betting on a fall in bitcoin’s value using futures trading on the Cboe Glolam Markets and those on the CME Group may be difficult and dangerous."

"Bespoke Investment Group's Dan Ciotoli believes the cryptocurrency's price could nearly triple by the end of the year — declaring that the January crash is likely behind it.
"There was a big run-up in December, and then we kind of saw these get-rich-quick-investors exiting the space. Everyone rushed in at once. So, the inevitable crash happened," he said Tuesday on CNBC's "Futures Now." "Now it's starting to recover. We saw a bottom around $9,000.""

No idea where this 60% idea came from. It's simple! 1. IRS says Crypto is treated as property. 2. SODL bitcoin and you realize gains just like stocks. So if you HODL bitcoin and DONT SELL for 1 year or less = Taxable income around say 25% depending on *edit income bracket? 3. HODL then SELL after 1 year and 1 day = capital gains tax around 15-20% right? Please CHIME IN and let's set the record straight on this FUD...

“The regulations in Korea will not have a negative effect,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based exchange Gatecoin, adding that on the contrary, “licensing brings certainty, which encourages already regulated entities ... to get involved in addition to skeptical retail investors.”

You pay capital gains - keyword “gains” so if you hODl and don’t sell you don’t “realize” gains. If you sell and make gains you pay only on the gains. And you pay based on your total income bracket for the year. And if you sell within one year you pay short term income tax while
Long term (1 year plus one day) you pay less taxes which are considered long term investments. Bitcoin.tax is your friend
