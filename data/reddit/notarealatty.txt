They conducted business in the US, so US courts would still have jurisdiction.  Not that you can get water from a stone anyway though.

I bet they'd rather have millions of clothes and places to sleep opposed to fractions of those things....so they likely care about millions relative to fractions on some level.  I still hate doge coin though.

They should at least get in touch with their state or local labor board.  While the employee may not get anything out of it, the employer will at least be investigated, fined or otherwise punished.  Future employees will be less likely to be taken advantage of and it doesn't cost the employee anything because the labor board use all their own lawyers.

Because it takes them extra effort to get the tip (for the uninitiated) and I wouldn't want to give them the impression that btc is a pain in the ass or that the community is a bunch of jerks that just makes them have to do extra work for the usual tip.  I feel like it increases the likelihood that they join the community, rather than just cash out the tip asap.  Normally I leave about 18%-25+% for adequate to good service. I would definitely increase that by 5-10% if I left the tip in btc

BadgerHunt is infringing the trademark of the brands they're showing on the shirts to advertise their site/service.  It's not the photo of the shirt that's the problem, it's the fact that consumers viewing the site might view it as Coke or Starbucks endorsing/participating with badgerhunt.com, which seems very unlikely.  It's the same reason that TV shows often blur out trademarks.  The marks are worth fortunes and you're pretty naive if you don't think they have entire teams of lawyers dedicated to protecting these marks.  
Pictures of t-shirts that are licensed by the owner of the mark wouldn't alone be infringement (though it seems unlikely these shirts are even licensed, since none seem to sport a registered trademark symbol).  Pictures of these same shirts used to promote a product or service, as is the case here, certainly constitutes infringement.

Does each employee have an individual address or are the tips pooled and somehow divided among the employees?  Is this done by management or do employees take care of it themselves?  Great idea, but I can see it being abused by an employer (not trying to accuse your company of this though).  If anything it's a good idea because it's more transparent than cash tipouts.  Just look at the block chain and the employee can see exactly how much was received in tips and what his/her share should be.
Edit: Sorry I should have scrolled down a little further.  This was already answered.  Awesome work.

Accepting bitcoin, understanding bitcoin, and being able to litigate a class action suit with 10's of million of dollars on the line and 100s if not thousands of class members are all drastically different.  Accepting bitcoin certainly does not make him competent or financially equipped  to handle such a case (class actions are extremely expensive, and very specialized).  A class action wouldn't really make much sense in this context from an individual perspective either, unless you're happy with recovering pennies on the dollar.  Anyone that has a significant amount tied up in this should personally contact an attorney.

You obviously don't actually think *everyone* is going to sue.  Even if 5% of customers filed a claim that would be a huge portion, unless a class action suit were to be filed...

I heard a story on here a few weeks ago of a girl refusing a paper wallet with something like .2 btc on it.  I'd just make it clear that I'd be willing to tip them considerably more in btc, though I think a lot of people would still just take the cash.

This was not the "free market," it was the government making large investments in companies to encourage development.  It's not really the forces of the free market when it's the government dictating whether or not the market even exists.  The government paying contractors to develop something is still a use of tax dollars for that development.  Most of the technology behind the internet arose directly from government/university research, or contracting private companies too develop new technologies, particularly for there military uses.  Very few major discoveries were made in the field without some form of government funding or at the very least intended gov't use.

Anybody taking legal advice from an attorney willing to disregard legal ethics to such a degree is going to get what they paid for.  I have a hard time believing that you couldn't reasonably expect people to use your "legal analysis" as advice.  This would violate so many rules in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct it's mind boggling.  Maybe you could get away with it if you did it pro bono (though still unlikely), but that's obviously not the point.  You better make sure you keep it anonymous because this would be cause for serious repercussions.  I'm not sure how many people are dumb enough to get their legal advice from an anonymous source on the internet.  I really hope people aren't that dumb.

The BBC is a private (extorionist) entity. They usually do not have enough power to resolve a $100 problem, let alone a dispute over half a million dollars. This is an issue that requires the Judicial system. The bbb is about as effective as posting a bad review on yelp.

I feel like they're just saying that to keep people's hopes up with higher orders numbers.  I'm somewhere around 12,000 and I ordered on Nov. 4.  Everytime I see someone else mention the date they ordered and their order number it seems to reasonably correlate with my own.

What happened to you in 2010?  I was asking why he never recovered them from his hdd if he had a decent amount.  
While trying to track down your "modeling photos" (which I never found and isn't loading for some reason) it lead me to Have you ever had any success getting gigs over there?  I've got a relatively valuable service to offer, but it would only really be worth anything to lawyers/law firms so I'm wondering how likely it is I'd get any interest.

Why not just ask for his ID prior to the transaction? May even a 2nd form too.  You could give him yours too. That way you both have a reason to stay honest (other than basic human decency)

This guy stole my property, in the form of bit coins. All that matters is the value from polices perspective. If he can figure out the guys name he doesn't even need the police though. He can just take him to small claims ct. Hopefully he got the license plate or has a phone number to connect the guy too

I'd put like ฿25,000 towards tuition and housing for you to get your PhD.  You're gonna have to use your increased earning capacity to get your own house though.  I'd use probably ฿150,000 - 250,000 to pay off all debt held by my immediate family and the student loan debt and/or future tuition for any of my extended family, as well as my good friends.  The rest I'd put into various businesses, including, but not limited to; a bike shop, a custom computer build/repair shop, a dj promotion business and a law firm (ideally all in the same building, so I can combine all of my dream jobs into one awesome job}.  Anything left over would probably be donated, put into existing non-profits or creating a new one and/or into lobbying for underfunded interest groups, since $ is the only way to influence policy changes in this country.  
I love playing this game every time the lottery gets North of $100,000,000.  Lottery tickets are for idiots, but every once in awhile I'm willing to throw away $2 in order to spend the next day fantasizing about what I'd do with all the money I'll never have.
