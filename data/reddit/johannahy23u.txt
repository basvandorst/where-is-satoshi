The whitepaper is Satoshi Nakamoto definition of Bitcoin. If you want to create something else go ahead. I will stick with the real Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash.

I personally just store my BTC in a debit card like [ and you can buy anything that takes visa

I thought lightning would need a different wallet not the normal segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:59
I lost 0.01 btc. 
Maybe will they recover my lost 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:13:03
Yea I always guessed that there will be less than 20 million BTC when its all said and done. 
Great project, but as far as being able to input your address, can people troll and put any address?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:12:43
yea I am fine with coinbase way of accepting Photo ID + visa.
Anyways its cool. I will just continue using coinbase. 
Thanks for the help : ) 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:45:02
Yea I use the ledger nano s and certainly tested the recovering process. 
Its great. 
My only issue is wanting them to add more coins like EOS
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:47:06
Awesome, glad to see shapeshift be able to do that. But is shapeshift decentralized? or can they recover any exchange that happens? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:40:14
What kind of verification did you need to do to get on cex.io?
Also do they have coins like EOS and iota? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:07
Hope they will pay back 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:27:58
Steemit is doing over 1,200,000 tx/day with 0 fee. And its creator is building EOS which will do a lot more.

Hey did glidera.io work for you?
Also whats the exact details they required from you? Just ID and SSN?

Just  in case the hacker is in a Robin Hood mood
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:49:29
good point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:39:02
Exactly but it seems Bitstamp and Gemini want them. 
Coinbase just needs your photo ID and Visa card and you can buy crypto. I guess I will just stick with them. Unless you know of another service?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:17:27
oh what did coinbase require from you for verification if you dont mind?
I can't do one that requires photo of bills since I am renting and dont get the bills so I am looking for one that only needs photo ID
I am trying to get some more EOS but need bitcoin to exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:12
Most exchanges will require at least photo ID. However, You can try localbitcoin.com if you really want to buy bitcoin without any identification.
I personally just want one like Coinbase where they just ask for photo ID
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:45:23
I live in the country side which cant receive mail and these exchanges don't accept PO box 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:30:49
Do I need to do anything or will it be automatic 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:44:58
awesome, sadly living in the country side limits my selection in people lol 
But yea doing it in person with real people sounds like the best way to do it :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:25:48
Does he have any :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:47:59
yea, I still think EOS could be a good buy even at the price now as they are delivering on their roadmap 
But yea I also got in early and loving the gains :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:49:56
What do you mean over the counter?
I am looking for something like coinbase. I may just stick with coinbase if there are no alternatives but I just was asking if anyone here knew one...
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:14:35
are there any cons to using segwit addresses? 
Like I remember I tried to send litecoin and it didnt work because the address I has was legacy and the deposit was segwit :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:52
Yes it is possible, Their Business / Product is connected with money, security is a must. They deployed their business/Product without even executing security pentest? That's pretty stupid thing, for sure they do all things to ensure the security is really secure. Inside Job is possible on this scenario and i am not going to argue about that. Businesses should focus more on their security.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:42:52
yea but I dont think binance allows you to buy with visa card. I do like that they added EOS recently tho so I may look into them
