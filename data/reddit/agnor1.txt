The big part of Bitcoin is build on probabilities.
There won't be partitioning, everything would remain the same, except long side chains would be reject.
When I say time, I don't mean time in block header, I mean time of block propagation to the network. 
Lets say 1 block is mined at some point of time and propagated to network. Network nodes accept a block and start mining 2'. So everybody is in sync.
But if in a short period of time one miner mines 1 and other mines 1'. Those block are propagated to the network, and part of the network will start mining 2 the other will start mining 2'. The only way to grow both chains is that 2 and 2' are mined around the same time and propagated to the network. Probability of something like this happening 6 times is extremely low.

When someone acquires bitcoin, he trust that after 6 confirmations those bitcoins belong to him, and that no one can take if from him. And that is on of the thing that gives bitcoin a value.
If that trust is broken, bitcoin will lose value. 
Eventually it doesn't matter what triggers the sidechain creation. If sidechain produces double spend intentional or unintentional, trust in bitcoin as irreversible ledger will disappear,  and thus the value will start to decrease. 
The frightening thing is that there is no prevention in code for double spend, all we have to do is hope that miners will behave nicely. 
And what would happen when block reward becomes so small that miners can't mine profitably?

Again it breaks the trust-less nature of bitcoin. You have to trust someone to give you money, even if they aren't obliged to give it to you. 
What if we aren't talking about one hour, what if we are talking about days. How much bitcoin will be lost there, and who will ever manage to refund all the users. What a mess that would be. 
So you are basically trusting your money to the biggest miner. And the biggest miner doesn't care about your money he cares about his profit.

So if we have something like this:
    0 -&gt; 1 - &gt; 2 - &gt; 3 - &gt; 4 - &gt; 5 - &gt; 6  -- first chain
       |
       1' - &gt; 2' - &gt; 3' -&gt; 4' -&gt; 5' - &gt; 6' - double spend attack chain 
What is the problem to mark 0 as most common block for 6 and 6'.
In this situation 1st chain will reject 6' as a new head and will ignore 6' completely.
Now because double spend attack chain is invalid chain he can do whatever it likes, it never can do a double spend.

Which is more than fine. As explained, probability of creating above chain by accident is practically 0.  Because two miner will have to mine approximately at the same time 1 and 1', the other two miners will have to mine 2 and 2'  at the same time, and so on until 6 and 6'. Most of bitcoin sidechains are just one orphan block in length.
The only reason how second sidechain of length 6+ can be created is by secretly being mined. When the hidden sidechain, of length 6+, is made public to the rest of the network, the rest of the network would just ignore it. Node with double spend chain will remain on that chain unless manually switched to main chain.

What is the problem, if current head is on a block soon to become orphan. After two blocks are mined on 'new' main chain, new main chain will have most of work accumulated and head would move to that block on new chain. Everything remains the same.
6 rules confirmation doesn't protect from 51% attack. It is possible to create arbitrary length sidechains, which can overwrite already processed 6+ confirmation transaction.
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:03:20
I'm not sure I understand. Everything would work the same for orphan chains shorter than 6 block. Which I assume are all the blocks in bitcoin chain. If orphan chain is shorter than 6 than that orphan chain can and will become main chain, when propagated to the rest of the network(and has the most of the work). If there are longer chains in the past, when bitcoin was just starting, there can be condition to apply it for newer blocks. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:46:57
That is the whole point. There aren't such branches in bitcoin blockchain. Because it is almost 0% percent probability that such branches will be created by chance. If something like this happened it is because one of those branches is secretly being mined to double spend some transaction on first branch. So we have one branch always visible and one hidden. That hidden should be rejected if it tries to overwrite visible branch.

You would also need to mine 6 block me to stay on your chain. If there aren't 6 block difference, when I connect to the rest of the network, I would switch on the main chain.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:30:42
Mining 6 block is not something that anybody can do. Idea is to prevent 51% which is by far more serious than isolated attacked client got stuck. Rejected sidechain can't grow for a long time because it is costly operation, so there can be a condition to switch those stuck clients to a main chain, if a main chain overtakes current chain by some some number of blocks(accumulated work).
51% attack doesn't have much with cryptography. There is probably a reason why this solution wouldn't work, because somebody would implemented it or something similar by now. But that reason I wouldn't find here, I'll try with stackoverflow.

6 confirmation is not a low confirmation number. It is the recommended number of confirmation. At that point you can just hope that other party will comply with your request. Not to mention internal exchange ledger would be in complete mess.

I believe they are. Blockchain is actually a tree and it is not hard to identify common node or orphan chain.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:43:21
Like rational miners on Moncacoin or Bitcoin Gold. As soon as mining has become unprofitable they conducted 51 percent attack. I would rather trust the code, not the miners. 
Of course I read, but I don't see it as something forbidden for discussion.

If something like this occurs now, lets say you bought some bitcoins while China was in dark, and because China has the greatest hash power they chain eventually wins, you wouldn't have any problems to lose yours bitcoins because they chain wouldn't have your transaction. In that case I would rather have a choice to choose which chain I would use. Also if the Chinese knew that mining while internet is off, will produce fork, they would stopped their miners.
