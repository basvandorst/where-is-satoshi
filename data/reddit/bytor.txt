If you're going to make a post like this you should be prepared to explain yourself. What prevents certain lightning nodes from maximizing their connections so they can rack up the fees?
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:07:03
LN doesn't have passive security like the blockchain, so it's susceptible to hackers and glitches kind of like conventional networks, except there's no central authority to mediate disputes. Not that brave because there seems to be less than $10k total capacity on the network right now, but in theory it could all be lost 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:22:23
Care to elaborate on your analogy? I know there are flaws but I don't see the PayPal analogy.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:41:37
You do know these problems are temporary right? Similar to how email was only available via glitchy command line early on. Proponents aren't asking people to use Bitcoin in it's current state. There are people working on fixes and the plan is to get back to near-zero fees like the network had 2 years ago. Volatility will fall in line with adoption. 
What I'm saying is, your concerns are valid from a practical perspective, but not a philosophical one.

I'm not claiming to know what this social experiment that is crypto will turn into. You're right that there are a lot of complex economic implications for the world to fully adopt Bitcoin as a global reserve currency, but you should give it a chance and do some unbiased research. Pretty much everything you're saying has been answered either by the community in forums, or by direct design in the Bitcoin system.
For example, if some guy says screw it and forks Bitcoin to create a billion more, he would have to convince the entire network to go along with it or his fork will be not replace the original chain. Unlike a centrally managed currency, consensus is required to make changes like that, and the market will determine the value of units on his forked coin. See Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and others.
Also with regard to your gold arguments, don't you wonder why jewelry would be made from gold when there are shinier, more durable metals available at lower costs? Maybe jewelry is made from gold because its known value, not the other way around. There may be industrial uses for gold, although I don't know any, and its value for something like semiconductors would be near that of copper, a few dollars per ounce compared to gold's $1300.

The 7 isn't fixed. We can get more with tricks like SegWit and batching. But I think you're correct that even Lightning will not solve scalability forever.

Blockchain has passive security. It takes a lot of energy to get something to change hands, so it's safe by default. Like a house, you don't really have to worry about someone stealing your house or it getting lost. Lightning channels are not the same deal. I'm free to try to forge transactions or move funds unfairly on LN without using too much energy. There will have to be active penalties enforced to keep me from doing so. I picture it like carrying cash.
Big purchases may never happen on lightning. We'll have to wait and see.

I don't think that addresses LN in nearly enough detail to answer these questions but thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:06:54
For a transaction to occur, the channels have to be funded with real bitcoin. If I want to send you 0.1 BTC, I have to directly or indirectly establish a channel to you and fund it with at least that much. We might decide to establish a channel with 0.5 BTC, which would tie up even more BTC than the on-chain transaction would have. In theory there would be a shitload of channels and a lot of BTC tied up funding them, way more than what's actually being used.
The price of Bitcoin and the technology are relatively independent in the short term. In the long term there are only 2 possibilities - success/adoption/moon, or failure/dismal prices.

@_date: 2018-01-19 06:13:32
A channel can only have a transfer as great as the amount of funds added to it. The funds are real bitcoin. So no new money is created. Not sure exactly how closing channels works though, whether you can walk away with your funds at any time.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:21:42
It does right now, but as long as users can afford to open a new channel for a miner fee I don't see any reason it can't be decentralized. Miner fees should go down significantly once traffic moves to LN. I think there will always be more and less connected nodes but no one will have to rely on just one.

@_date: 2018-01-19 06:50:02
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:16:24
No because each channel requires some Bitcoin to be committed, so really it should increase the demand. Also, the price doesn't matter.

Testnet is fun but we won't know anything about Lightning until there's a half-a-million-dollar prize for figuring out how to cheat it. That will only come with mainnet adoption. Testnet also doesn't tell us much about how the network will form since to the majority of users don't care about racking up testnet tokens.

I appreciate your conciseness but you'll need more than that.
Monopolies are very common in free markets due to first move advantages, cost of entry, economies of scale, etc. For a node to be useful the owner will need not just a server, but also enough Bitcoin to use as stake in all it's connections. Hubs seem like a very plausible outcome.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:12:53
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but this won't allow anyone to create more Bitcoin out of thin air. There has to be actual bitcoin backing every channel.

Only if you and the coffee shop were the only two on the network. To open business, the coffee shop will have already opened channels with several other merchants and individuals. When you first use LN you will also open a couple channels with merchants or individuals (yes you'll have to pay a Bitcoin transaction fee to do so but if everyone is using LN transaction fees should become cheap). As long as you are both connected to the network, Lightning will find the path of least resistance (thus the name) to connect you. No more fees or channels required as long as you're within 20 hops of the shop (mathematically extremely likely).
At least that's the theory. It works on testnet. Less than 50 people have been brave enough to try it on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:30:06

@_date: 2018-01-21 01:56:44
You're right on that point, aside from maybe security of large amounts, individuals would probably like to leave channels open all the time. I think the reasons against it have to do with performance of the network as a whole.

1. I'm well aware or monetary policy. Its existence is controversial. This one is a very involved debate and I'm not the guy to try it. The other points you made are easy to dismiss though.
2. The volatility is what I said was a result of the youth of the currency. Once people make up their collective mind about whether or not Bitcoin will be sticking around, price will stabilize similar to that of gold and other assets.
3. The whitepaper makes it clear that Bitcoin is mined with very clear guidelines, and is to be used almost like cash. It's a must-read for discussing crypto in general.
4. As far as the underlying and intrinsic value, please explain to me what value gold has if you can't trade it. It has no more 'intrinsic' value than Bitcoin. The reason gold is valuable is it's usefulness as a currency. It's scarce, nonperishable, and hard to forge. Bitcoin also has these qualities.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:02:15
Like tulips, crypto is also a speculative bubble. The difference is that crypto has implications far beyond just planting a certain kind of flower. Bitcoin isn't a novelty or collector's item, but a network that could solve real global issues. I don't think anyone ever envisioned a future where tulips cannibalized part of the financial system, but that's what Bitcoin could do, and unlike tulip bulbs, there is a necessarily fixed supply of BTC. So even if a bunch of idiots are buying into Bitcoin for the same reasons the Dutch were buying tulip bulbs, they're also unknowingly speculating in a potentially huge and real asset.
With that said I've been following the tech since 2013 and I can't believe people are throwing money into this network while it hasn't even demonstrated it's capability to scale. Back then it worked great for the tiny amount of traffic it had, but now everything is slow and expensive and it doesn't seem realistic to use. Maybe it's like investing in domain names before the internet was usable, idk. It's madness for sure but only time will tell just how ridiculous it is.

I think we're exaggerating the wealth transfer effect it would have. 
Say Bitcoin gradually replaces all other currencies over the next 10 years. Yes, the nerds would benefit as the wealthy exchanged their USD and EUR for BTC, but the wealthy have houses, businesses, land, armies, networks of other wealthy individuals who control all these things. Even if their fiat is completely devalued, cash makes up probably a few percent of their holdings, if that.
There will be implications for government and taxes, but unless a revolution on the ground accompanies the crypto revolution, governments will find a way.
It's not going to flip the world on its head.

The value of a stock is the time-adjusted value of all profits the company will ever make. People can speculate about short term trends of this market-estimated value, causing additional fluctuations, but that's the basis. If you bought all the shares in a company and kept running it the way it's going, you'd expect to make your money back.
Bitcoin, like gold, has no valuation. It's simply a trusted store of value. Personally, the current price of Bitcoin, at 3% of gold's seems, pretty reasonable to me, but neither price has any fundamentals to go on. It's purely a market price. (Market cap of BTC $200bln, market cap of gold $7trln, BTC equivalent to 17 lbs of gold)

It's not a transition. I always ask the people who say that, have you ever actually used Bitcoin? It sucks right now. Not only is it only accepted at a few places, but it is slow and expensive as hell. Why would I transition from cash or credit card or PayPal or Venmo to a method that costs dollars per transaction and takes an hour to have confidence in? And it doesn't even have good privacy.
Sure there are Venezuela and Zimbabwe and some other rare use cases, but not enough to account for a market cap nearing 3% to that of gold.
Nobody is transitioning to Bitcoin right now. Millions are betting that there will be a transition in the future, once some yet-to-be designed upgrades and layer 2 scaling solutions are deployed.
Coming up we have threats from governments all over the world, a dozen of other objectively better crypto currency systems whose only weakness is their relative youth, environmental issues with the huge amount of energy being used by miners, unresolved internal conflicts within the community, and more.
Until everything mentioned here is addressed (except maybe environmental, we might just let that go), the price is absolutely speculation and a bubble. If somehow we do effectively scale before the next cryptocurrency and we aren't torn apart by those issues, the value warrants a market cap beyond that of gold. Until then, it's ridiculous to call this a transition.

Not quite infinitely though. Only down to the 100 millionth. If we were down to 1 BTC with the current market cap, 1 Satoshi would be worth $3,000 and we'd have no smaller increments.

I've seen a lot of people claiming that with Lightning, it's logical to end up with some designated nodes that keep many payment channels open with high balances so they can route the most transactions and therefore collect the most fees.
What keeps institutions from running these massive nodes and controlling the network?

1. Traders and speculators no longer have to use the blockchain. This should help with the issues like exchanges going down for volume, and mempool backing up.
2. It should help with volatility, since traders will be allowed to bet more specifically on their predicted outcome rather than trading the actual asset.
3. Recognition from these institutions adds legitimacy and makes it harder for the US government to interfere without repurcussions on Wall Street
I'd be interested to hear disadvantages that scare you. For me, one thing I don't like is that Bitcoin is becoming a tool for speculation or a get-rich-quick scheme way faster than it's actually becoming useful. Futures are going to exist and we still have ridiculous fees and can't  support more than a few transactions per second.

Yeah I mean I get the deflationary currency rewarding savers, but saving is not lending. If everyone used Bitcoin and was therefore rewarded for holding on to their currency, who in their right mind would let me borrow some Bitcoin to start a business? It's relative, but the interest rate would have to be quite high, which means borrowing would be more difficult. I don't think you've got it right.
For goods and services the model is not the same as investing or lending. When I sell groceries out of a supermarket, I'm charging a premium for them to cover my expenses, plus some profit for myself. The inflation doesn't really come into play because I'm spending most of my revenue on expenses.
For loans, though, inflation/deflation is critical since the repayment will have to counteract whatever the change in value is over the course of the loans life. This is the basis for monetary policy.

I'm assuming you mean conversion fees. If the landlord accepts Bitcoin as rent, maybe he has close to enough Bitcoin flow to pay OP. That could end up saving him conversation fees. As for tx fees, I don't think $5 every 2 weeks will make a difference considering his paycheck will probably swing 5% in value before he can spend it.

The SEC has rules for how this type of information can be shared and who are considered insiders, etc for public companies.

The implied skewedness is exactly what's interesting. The median is probably closer to 0.21 BTC. The wealth is extremely concentrated. Even if some of the big addresses are exchanges, that still shows that the vast vast majority of bitcoins aren't in the hands of actual regular people.

The latest boom isn't technical. It's about acceptance in the public. With 30% of millennials having direct experience with it and everyone else hearing about it constantly, Bitcoin has finally become a household name as a secure store of value, and successfully shaken it's reputation as a tool reserved for internet drug dealers. With futures now being traded in SEC-regulated exchanges, it's damn-near legitimate. 
The function is actually far worse than it was last year. Transactions aren't even worth making anymore due to the high costs. Somehow this doesn't stop people from wanting to own some though.
There is some hope of fixing the scaling problems in the next year or so though, maybe. The tone of your comment is right on point.

You can manipulate bitcoin all you want on its own, but without a futures market you can't really reap the profits.

That is highly illegal using SEC-regulated futures.

Yes in most places. It is off-limits to drink on the street in a lot of commercial districts, and to drink while driving in most places. I can walk down my street drinking a beer, but that's not my primary measure of freedom.
Edit: Just realized you must be under 21. Yeah we have weird laws about minors drinking. Europe gets +1 for minors being able to drink in public I guess.
Edit2: You edited the shit out of that but I'll try to respond. 
Talk of UK intervening in internet porn - 
EU internet censorship - 
Lmk if I've been misled.
The right to bear arms is the right to defend onesself, and it represents the final check against tyrrany. Sure there's room for debate on the policies, but certainly this right is at least as important as public drinking.
Yeah we can drink freely in most parks and stuff. A lot of places ban open consumption but if you cover the label and dont show intoxication it's fair game. Once again I don't see that as the primary freedom.
Are there any other essential liberties you enjoy in Europe that you know of being limited in the States? 
I've also heard of large cash transactions being banned. feel like the EU is much more likely to intervene in crypto and precious metal holdings than the US.

Semi-automatic rifles and makeshift explosives seem to do just fine resisting occupations in places like Iraq. Of course one person cannot combat the entire federal government, that would be ridiculous,  but if the general population agreed on a threat, either internal or external, they would not be completely defenseless. Even a single criminal must pose a big threat in rural Europe. How can you prevent him from robbing you if he's bigger and stronger?
Prisons are fucked, I'll definitely give you that one,  especially for the black population. In theory though, those are serious law-breakers anyway.
We have loads of diabetics here and they get by just fine. I can't name a single way "net neutrality" has affected me either way. And I consider those freedoms to handle healthcare myself and to have a fairly regulation -free internet connection.
Especially in the context here, which is wealth confiscation, I'm not hearing anything in favor of Europe. EU probably wins on freedoms of drugs, sex, abortions, and things like that. America is more religiously conservative. EU probably gets in bed less with corporations too, so there is less corporate control. But property rights I think the states win.

Yeah I think what that vague pseudo-mathematical expression was trying to convey is that comparing transaction volumes makes more sense than market cap.
Although I think Bitcoin surpassed the transaction volumes of all those payment services a while ago, and it's not a perfect comparison anyway since Bitcoin gets traded a lot for investment purposes, whereas every PayPal transaction symbolizes an actual exchange.
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:00:46
You may be out of the loop on how BitPay operates now. I'm not criticizing them at all for converting to fiat immediately. BitPay now only accepts BIP70 payments, not the normal BIP21 standard used by everyone forever. Only a handful of wallets support BIP70 and apparently it comes with less privacy.

I think I just got scammed by them as well. Sent the minimum transaction amount (0.2 BTC) to test it, and received nothing. 
When I contacted them they responded that I had been flagged as a potential money launderer and to receive payment I needed to send a bunch of identifying information within 72 hours.

It's more about the volatility than the value. Right now retailers have to list all prices in fiat and convert at the time of the transaction, because otherwise prices would fluctuate wildly.

"Imminent bull run"
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:47:35
The short answer is yes. But there are a few reasons it shouldn't go down like that. First of all the fee is determined by the market, so a $100 fee is nonsense. From December's madness, $30 fees were nonsense too but so was quadrupling the price over 3 months. If bitcoin is being used as currency and not for retail speculation, fees shouldn't ever get that high unless the blocks are full of $10,000+ transactions. 
The second reason is that if you don't need the transaction to go through on the next block, you can always pay a smaller fee and wait for a less-demanded block. Even during periods of high fees, you could get by with much smaller fees if you were willing to wait a day to use your channel.
What will probably happen for end users is trusted third party apps that are well connected will serve sort of like ISPs do to the network. It'll take these nuances out of the experience. Sort of like e-mail, you'll still be able to run your own server easily, but few will bother. This is OK with me because if they try to pull anything remotely shady they'll lose all their business quickly. As long as regulation doesn't step in and ruin it again by creating high entry barriers.
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:54:33
Another anecdote I like is if the average millionaire wanted to keep 1% of their wealth in bitcoin, the market cap would have to be, at the absolute least, $500 billion ($30k/BTC) to accommodate.
That's just the absolute lower bound for this to be possible. The actual price would be astronomically higher, but it just puts the moon in perspective. Assumptions: 50 million millionaires with wealth of exactly $1 million, 16 million bitcoin available, no other use of bitcoin besides these millionaires hoarding it.

OP may not realize it but he actually asks a valid question. Lightning Network is not bitcoin-specific. Once atomic swaps are enabled, a myriad of blockchains will become interconnected and interoperable. Once that happens, bitcoin's network effect will be negligible and its value will be at the mercy of the free market of coins.
It will probably still be the most secure and tamper-proof though. Digital gold forever.
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:20:04
I've heard this argument but I think it's a little more nuanced than that. 10 GB blocks could easily handle more transactions as the Visa network, and probably considerably more with a few software optimizations. If you think we'll need significantly more eventually, keep in mind that bigger blocks doesn't prevent second layer solutions down the line.
Interesting to bring up processor as the bottleneck though. Any quantitative info on how CPU usage would scale with block size?

What was that first part about Moore's Law? Processors will get more efficient and hardware requirement for mining will rise, but a full node just has to download, broadcast and store.

If I were to try to remove the bias from these 2 sides of the bet:
BCH is a known-to-work scaling solution with uncertain medium term prospects. At best, it is bitcoin aka digital cash, and inherits decentralization as tech catches up. In the long term, 10 GB blocks will probably be a breeze even on mobile devices.
BTC is counting on a not-quite-certain-to-work, but much more ambitious, scaling solution. Nothing about layer 2 is clearly defined though, and the ability to deliver world-changing new money (digital cash) depends desperately on a layer 2. It will likely remain the best digital gold for the foreseeable future, and if layer 2 does succeed, will be able to serve as a superior digital cash too.
If you think you know enough about lightning to project its future with relative certainty, I think you are either very smart or very stupid. If shit goes sideways or delays too long, look for bitcoin cash to fill the void.

@_date: 2018-06-08 00:27:36
It's really not that bad of a concept in practice. Nobody's gonna run a full node anyway and mining is designed to be competitive. The principle of being able to run an effective full node is so damn fundamental, but if layer 2 software doesn't solve scalability in time for mass adoption, we're better off using BCH until the hardware catches up. The hardware will catch up eventually. 
A bet on BTC is a bet on layer 2 devs and the momentum behind the king of crypto.

I think it should be up to people who compare Bitcoin to stocks to explain why the comparisons are relevant, but I'll humor you:
For one, stock splits don't have any impact on the stock other than to change the nominal share price and number of shares.  If you have 1 share $XYZ at $100 before the split, you have 2 shares at $50 after the split. Both shares are identical and nothing else changes. Bitcoin forks are something entirely different and involve the creation of a new blockchain with incompatible rules. Bitcoin forks are more similar to basketball games than stock splits.
Gold is a more reasonable comparison because like Bitcoin, gold is a finite resource accepted as a store of value despite not representing any actual assets or being regulated by any entity. Bitcoin is no more similar to a stock than it is to a toilet paper, except that both are very liquid. Gold at least behaves similarly.
Market caps are just the total value of an entity. Sure you can compare Bitcoin market cap to a company's, but who cares if the value of all bitcoins put together is greater than the market valuation of a company? You could also compare the $100 billion Bitcoin market cap to the GDP of a country, or the total price of all real estate in your state, but why would you? To me these are only relevant for putting numbers in perspective.
Hope this helps.

When there are no more bitcoins to mine, miners will relieve only the transaction fees for all the transactions in that block. By that time we hope this is sufficient incentive.
21 million BTC can be mined on the current blockchain. If a hard fork is created, the forkers can do whatever they want with it. The network will likely oppose increasing that cap though, because that would just decrease the value of their holdings. Your friend might also think that a fork creates more bitcoins, but it really doesn't. The new blockchain is totally independent of the original one, so "Bitcoin" mined on the new chain is something entirely separate. See bitcoin cash.

So of course there is a balance between decentralization and transaction power, and the blocksize is the most prominent knob to move across this spectrum. Whatever your preference is, there is an optimal blocksize for it. It may be 2MB, 8MB, 100MB, or it may be 0.5MB, or 0.25MB. But what are the chances that the optimum value is exactly 1MB and Satoshi got it right on the first guess?
Also, what evidence do you have that a 2MB blocksize would make a significant change in it? Its cool how people are getting excited and passionate about this concept but are we actually thinking about it?

In theory 2X would lower fees and speed up transactions, if everyone adopted it. The problem is the 2X roadmap is unclear, and ditches the core Dev team (who got us into this mess of slow transactions, but are also the only 50-60 trusted people who have consistently worked on Bitcoin SW since the beginning) in favor of like 2 less known devs. A lot of people are strongly against this, so even if you like 2X, the chance of a nice transition is very slim. This leaves all the problems of confusion, replay attacks, divided mining resources, etc. That's why people call it an attack.
Basically this is not how you increase the blocksize. If you wanted  to ditch the core devs and increase blocksize, Bitcoin cash was the proper way to do it. IMO core devs should have agreed to increase the blocksize themselves a long time ago and we wouldn't have this problem.

I thought ATMs were a great solution but it turns out they're requiring the most intrusive KYC of all.

There could be apps that let you purchase small amounts via in-app purchases. These things don't seem to be happening though. You either sign your soul over to a big exchange, or you avoid crypto altogether.

This is interesting actually, because this implies that the equilibrium is driven more by the supply side meeting demand. For example, a rise in bitcoin prices due to widespread adoption results in more miners participating until mining is no longer profitable.

I'd recommend taking one step at a time. Sure we can ask devs to add Lightning to the accepted payments list, but Lightning is an infant.
Bitcoin is usable, reliable, and owned, carried, and accepted by many. What we need first and foremost is a directory where people can look up crypto-friendly spots when they want to eat or shop. These merchants can then see a return on their investment in accepting bitcoin, and the community can grow.

This is more exciting to me than a lot of the hyped stories going around. This is a real use case and not just a novelty like many shops and restaurants.
AZ will save significant money by not processing all these checks, money orders, ACH payments and however people pay taxes. The funds will be almost immediately available and spendable. Using this method every citizen of AZ could wait til the last hour of the deadline to file and the state government would be able to spend the funds within the hour. Refunds could be available to citizens minutes after whatever the state does with tax filings without a single piece of paper being printed. TurboTax will integrate BTC payment.
States tend to mimic one another once these things are proven. This is the most encouraging news for Bitcoin I've seen in a while.

Is this true? Any sources?

Sounds like you just want to put your money in a bank.

I guess so. Still an audit virgin.

Thats faster than these for sure then. But I also wouldn't want to give my driver's license info to some company. That kind of goes against everything Bitcoin stands for.

This is a fun list, but I don’t think comparing market caps is actually relevant, is it? Maybe just to show how a bank wouldn’t be able to take control?
I think it makes more sense to compare bitcoin market cap to other currencies or assets that are used a medium of exchange or store of value. Gold and physical USD are both in the trillions.

I'm not the best person to answer that, but don't think there's anything inherently centralized about the hubs. The centralization risk people talk about is the chance that a few companies monopolize these hubs, but Joseph Poon claims there is no incentive to do so. 
Maybe someone else can chime in on how realistic that threat is.

Is the price of an ounce of gold equal to the cost to mine it?

The comments below this one are truly unbelievable. In my opinion this is a real threat to the movement. When I first bought bitcoin I went around looking for places to spend it to reward merchants who adopted it. Lately when I tell people I own bitcoin they act like I just have a stash of lottery tickets. Although now even I’m guilty of hodling, waiting to see $10k and then the next ATH.

Be careful with these. This looks like Menufy, which charges ridiculous fees to act as a middleman and payment processor, but does appear to accept Bitcoin by default. Mamma Leone has probably never heard of bitcoin.

Educate yourself before posting again.

Do you have a link by chance?
EDIT: Found [this]( In this post it seems like Satoshi was only in favor of a single implementation for practicality purposes; not that he had a fundamental objection to multiple implementations. I do think multiple implementations can make hard forks a nightmare, but maybe they should be. It's like amending the constitution. So maybe if you want to do that, you should need a very good reason that others will be willing to put development and testing time into.

Thank you for your insightful views. It is clear you have spent a lot of time studying the field and put a lot of thought into this topic. My only question for you is, are you literally retarded?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:35:01
Thank you. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. A mod even told me there was no such thing as "bitcoin core". Anyone who's ever so much as looked into running a full node should know exactly what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:30:35
Yeah, I think this is the case for most cryptocurrencies, and I agree that the nodes are the most important part. But with a single client being relied on, there is an attack vector in gaining control of that project. If a bad actor took over the bitcoin core github and started sneaking in bad updates, good devs would have to scramble to fork the SW and get everyone back to the uncompromised version. 
If I'm remembering correctly, last year Bitcoin Core was like 70% or less, with several other projects maintaining large numbers of nodes. Now the remaining alternatives are basically negligible. I might be wrong about the risk but I'm looking for someone to tell me why.
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:22:17
I can't tell if you're joking or if you just don't know what you're talking about at all. Bitcoin Core is the most popular implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It is the software users run to use a full node. See 
I think you're referring to how big blockers sometimes refer to bitcoin as "bitcoin core" because in their eyes the protocol has been hijacked by this team of core devs, but this has nothing to do with that.

I have 2 transactions pending for almost a week now with no confirmations. Still not sure how to fix it. Commenting in case someone else has a good answer.
Edit: ok I exaggerated they're still under 3 days old. Here's a helpful link that was posted in another comment 
Edit2: Transactions finally confirmed. 3.5 days later. Guess it works out eventually.
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:32:36
Nothing against the core dev team, but we used to have a much more colorful pie graph that looked a lot more robust. Now we're looking pretty dependent on one software client.
