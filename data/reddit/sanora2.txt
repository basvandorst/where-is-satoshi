Why not just sell it through an exchange?

It would certainly be possible to write an application or script for this but I don't think anyone is willing to do this for free. It doesn't sound like a 10 minute job because it'll need to be able to scan different kind of filesystems and different kind of files/apps.
You're probably better of doing it manually, especially because the chance is high your wallets are empty.

Are you currently focussing on USA based charities only? I've gone through the list today and it seems they are all USA based.
Just a question, no offense.

more and more people sound scared and get out. Some left for good (or long times) and others keep telling "i will buy back at a lower price". People always say "I wish it comes down to the prix of $xxxx. I'll buy as much as I can!!". But when it dips to $xxxx people don't buy and say "nah, i'll buy at $yyyy".. But everyone seems to be doing this so the "bottom" can be very very low imo. It's a vicious circle. And when it's that low point people will be like "wtf? I'm not buying this anymore. It's worth nothing now and won't recover".... Same story goes for all TA "specialists". They keep telling everyone "$XXXX is the bottom, ladder your buys there!" .. And when $XXXX is near they say "nah, ladder your buys at $YYYY".. It's so funny to read all this shit but in reality, when you think about it and look at the bigger picture: all these calls are so stupid

It looks like the bulls left
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:07:55
So never $9K again?
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:33:38
Not always true.

It's bitfinex's wallet.

Still HODLing my 7BTC but I feel stupid. I better sold at $10k and buy back now. Or how low will it go? :/
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:43:50
what is the problem with them?
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:42:47
If it was dead the charts would flatline and that didn't happen (yet).
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:22:35
But if it's planning on dipping below 3.5K you better sell now and buy back at 3.5K :p
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:41:50
What makes you think so?
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:46:58
Are you serious with point 2 ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:44:01
Nobody knows what btc price will be in near or far future and anyone who tells differently is lying. Only you can decide what's best in your situation.

And yes, I know I better sold at $19k even but it's been going down and I thought about selling @ $10k. Just kept thinking it'll go back up, but it's clearly not (yet) the case.
I wonder how long it'll take for this to recover to &gt;$10k. If it ever will.

We're in a bear market right now and it looks like a continuation since december. What low price do you think we're heading to right now before we get a decent bounce?
Or aren't we going to see &gt;$9k anytime soon anymore ? :(
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:47:37
It can't go below 0
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:51:28
People said we broke the december down trendline but everyone is drawing it from the december upper wick down but if you ignore the wick this is what you get:
BTC seems to be reacting to it right now and this would mean the down trend hasn't been broken yet?
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:34:51
why not? I used them many times before, never had any troubles so I didn't see a need to do this in multiple smaller transactions.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:11:16
I'm in the same situation.
They hardly reply and if they reply the only thing they tell me is I have to wait for their security team to look into it.
They asked for picture + id .. then they asked for another picture with their own image in the background (why didn't they do that to begin with??).. No reply since I sent them this picture.
The company behind Changelly is anonymous too. They use whois privacy protection on their domains, no phone, no address, nothing. 
Very fishy service and I'm already waiting for over a week now...
