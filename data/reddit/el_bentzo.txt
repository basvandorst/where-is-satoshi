No, it'd probably have to get below 10k for that to be a reasonable claim and then you have to look at other indicators and possible causes and really start thinking hard. It went from 1k--&gt;20k in a year. A retracement of half (10k) to 70% is perfectly normal based on retracements that have happened the past year, but if sentiment or something else has shifted, that should perk your ears up.

We need to start a petition for Gemini to verify faster! And if they don't, we're moving our monies back to Coinbase!

That's a very good question.

Okay, so explain to me the flaw in what I'm saying, so that I can at least learn.

Getting more coins, more servers, more customer service people hired is definitely higher priority. These first two are the biggest reasons why I (and I'm sure a lot of customers) don't use Coinbase.

Why would you ignore altcoins? They've gone up way more than bitcoin this year.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:31:10
It's not rigged. They're just overloaded.

Just today there have been three dips! :D
And on Dec 3rd, it went from 11,800 to 10,200 in just a couple hours.

Make sure you're verified with Bittrex or they won't let you withdraw.

The blanket remark was being facetious.
How is a credit card not a function of technology? The Atlantic is implying it's worthless because of its raw materials and that the raw materials are all that matter, but the magnetic strip performs a useful function and that worthless piece of plastic doesn't have to function as a means to withdraw dollars from your account, it could be used to subtract anything you have an account of, whether it's gold, bitcoin or Dave &amp; Buster points.

If you're trading that often then why aren't you just leaving your money on the exchange?...based on your post, it sounds like you're withdrawing everything off the exchange every time you sell your BTC

Yes. GDAX is basically Coinbase's exchange. Also, you can transfer USD into Coinbase without purchasing a coin. What I did was transferred USD into Coinbase then moved the USD onto GDAX and then bought ETH on Coinbase and then moved my ETH to an exchange that had more coin options.

Is there a way to tell how much of the correction is caused by the CME big short idea? It would also be interesting to also figure out if new money coming in is realizing what is happening in terms of the tx issues going on and if that is affecting what they do and if that has slowed down new money coming in.

I think mempool pushes it out of queue after 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:45:48
But when you move from Coinbase to GDAX does it actually hit the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:50:27
Agreed. This is why I stopped subscribing to the Atlantic. ALL of those items in the list have some value except maybe the dollar bill. Iron is a mineral the body needs and is used for cookware amongst other things. The credit card because it's linked to your account and allows you to withdraw from your account, so it really has the function of technology. It's like saying an ATM has no value. The dollar is probably the only thing that can reasonably work for their list, but bills can still be sewn together to make a blanket or a sweet shirt or burned for warmth.

In the 90s you had the dotcom bubble. I'd say that this would be more comparable to that than tulip mania. And now, the current price of tech/internet stocks exceed the bubble price. Bubbles form through speculation that give a price higher than the current fundamentals say it should be. If everyone buying Bitcoin was only buying it to spend and not speculate, then you could easily say that it's not in a bubble.

It's like a big ol' game of Arkanoid!

So if this is true, this means the new Bitcoin is on sale for $990?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:41
Agreed. I would definitely diversify especially if you wanna just buy and walk away. It's always a very real possibility that a new coin could come along and replace any of the existing coins. Even 15% in alts isn't that much.

You forgot the house gets a share. It's like a poker table. :)

$4800 is very reasonable just based on the corrections, not crashes, we've already had several times this year.
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:37:12
Exactly. 2030 is too soon. Have to at least extend it out 50 years
