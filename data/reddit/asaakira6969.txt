what happened will all that 'funds are safe' shit, or was that just a meme?

wow i never realized this is what stuff like Trezor (id assume) did, thanks

are you missing the bigger picture? the goal is to get people using crypto instead of 'real' money for everything
although transaction fees on btc are so high that it wouldnt be worth it, why something like dash might be better for day to day adoption

well people like him or whoever can already just link their btc address right? so theres not even a need for a platform
but i guess the platform could set up rewards for certain levels of donations a la patreon

oh really, nice
i just started looking in to crypto but i'll probably use them then, cant find much bad that theyve done

i think the point is that the value increasing over time is so marginal as the curve levels off that its essentially not gaining or losing any value due to inflation, a slight increase to value from lost keys as you say
but the graph on the right is supply, not value. just like with gold or anything else, the value will always fluctuate based on different things, so its not like it will keep going up or down

is this really what people have resorted to? lol
it is a 0 sum game. in terms of your example, if you bought btc at 9000 and now its 3000, you may value still holding it but you've lost 2/3 of your original purchasing power

customs is always hit or miss (i guess they never miss .....) 
going back and forth from canada to US even as a US citizen i've dealt with retards on both sides. although yeah if youre in either place why not travel somewhere better, canada and us are almost interchangeable imo 
except the milk bags... wtf

so to be clear as a noob... you have to what, save the wallet.dat file somewhere like a USB then write your private key down somewhere as well? those are the 2 things you need? if you just have your private key the coins are unrecoverable?

and the shitty music reminded me of this instantly

they will try to ban btc because 'drugs and pedophiles' as soon as it gets more traction as a real currency rather than a speculative bubble, i think

I'd imagine a good chunk of those people know what he's really saying, they just are part of the 'i am right even if im wrong i am right, and everyone else who thinks anything else is wrong' group
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:49:12
they did, they sold it at auction the fuckers

we're the only ones that care. people use windows 10 and think they got it for 'free' because microsoft is nice, they use free gmails and think their emails are private
hell people are PAYING $50-100 to have google/amazon microphones in every room
just as you see people advocating for 'banning guns', you will see the same retards cheer for the banning of encryption and cryptocurrencies. because "terrorism and pedophiles"

im new to bitcoin but every documentary ive seen touts that the big benefit of bitcoin is moving away from a single entity that controls your money... isnt something like this going directly opposite to that 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:40:16
its digital i guess. i would be afraid it will be shut down as whatever argument you make btc is to launder money with, it applies even better to usdc unless im missing something
