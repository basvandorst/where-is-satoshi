Sorry I would like to change btc for thb on this exchange and withdraw on my Thai Kasikorn bank account. I want to do it BEFORE going to Thailand while I am in Europe but it appears that this site require you are in Thailand when you use it. My questions are : can I declare the address of my hotel were I ll stay ? Do they verify if I am really in Thailand when I want to withdraw (asking for a Visa copy or a passport stamp copy) ? 
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:56:33
Pretty expensive exchange

@_date: 2014-05-29 00:46:22
Looks like a big scam
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:33:54
If you have to sell to buy stuff you need, you invest too much. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:39:12
Seems a scam. NEVER sell bitcoin for PayPal!

Bitcoin is a payment system which is also a good wealth investment. Soon a better payment system with Segwit.

Really dude never tell your wife or gf about crypto. You don't know what may happen tomorrow.

I am a boomer and I bought btc and ethers for my millennials sons many years ago. For many years I gave them pocket money but half the amount was to buy bitcoins and ethers.I bought for myself too. I didn't give them anything until now. I dont need to spend all this money so yeah they will cash out in a few years and be wealthy.
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:32:10

I think you don't understand the security a Trezor offers.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:35:13
Store of value has a real meaning in a long term perspective. Bitcoin is a very  good store of value when it passes its speculation point.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:06:20
Translation : There are those who get excited about the soaring bitcoin. And those who wonder what these outbreaks and societal destructuration imply (absurd accumulation of wealth without effort) will produce violence tomorrow.

His own dick if btc not &gt; 500,000 in 3 years from now 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:52:26
"Buying Bitcoin when it was $.01 to $1000 was a stupid risky investment for anyone over 50 years old."
Not really so stupid or risky to just throw in $1000 in 2011 or 2012. Small risk, huge possible reward and being part of the next miracle for freedom since Greek democracy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:56:46

France is probably the worst It may reach 67%tax if you sell a bunch of BTC.
Portugal is actually 0% unless you are trading or doing a business around cryptos. The is a cool resident program and wonderful beaches. No taxes for your heist.
Germany is tax free if you sell long term.

Yes but I would choose to burn a DVD instead. You can have virus in the firmware of a USB stick. And be careful and verify the md5 or hash256 of your iso. Choose a release iso from a well known and secure source.  Disconnect the rj45 wire. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:10:51
Short answer No, just buy.
