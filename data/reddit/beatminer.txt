It's a fucking problem, and everyone one here is closing their eyes and say "dont worry about your money ,they are good guys".

You could do one showing how btc transactions are not completely anonymous...

some say all this mining and stuff are already going down and not the best thing to start new business. Or maybe it's bullshit?

Stock trading and Bitcoin investing are totally different breed but this parody video was a good entertainment to watch once

satoshi moved way from bitcoin way before the formation of the foundation, so un-foundation related, sorry to burst that bubble.

I will also ban bitcoin. Does that mean something?

I'm currently cycling all around Southeast Asia and looking to spend/trade some BTC along the way (it's the only money we have to fund the trip!). Not much can be found on  for the remote parts of S.E.A. and neither on  do you guys know of places which accept BTC or people that want to buy? Any other suggestions?

Amazon will never consider btc as they have their own payment services

Bitcoin at $10 will openly happen in extreme scenarios. Even the Mt Gox robbery could not make BTC to go below the $300 mark. Only if some previously unknown bug is found, which makes double spending and counterfeit possible, the BTC can go below $10 mark. And I don't think that such chances exceed more than 0.00000001% in probability for a 100-year return-period.

Can you explain security behind this project? I might guess you control actual users bitcoin wallets and android users control them over api. How this can mitigate an evil gateway attack scenario? Why you would choose such kind of gateways instead of paid sms gateways with local numbers. Thank you

Yes, but he he/she/they will be spending them on goods or services, not fiat.

Does it work alone like the KNC Jupiter or I simply install it's drivers to a computer and run cgminer from the computer? Also, would a windows computer work with it?

Why is BitPay raising all this money?
Don't they makes enough money already?

The Russian Economy Ministry expects the money drain could reach $100 billion by the end of this year, while the World Bank forecasts the capital outflows may top $150 billion in 2014. 
maybe this is why Russia dislikes bitcoin)

bitcoin was never truly illegal, but by formally making it usable in california can this law be used against banks that ban customers purely for using bitcoin, with no evidence of laundering/drugs or terrorism??
meaning banks cant just ban joe public unless there is proof of illegal activities, no longer able to just shout "you use bitcoin, your banned"

Lol, would've given you a gold if I got the money! 
This is so right - reddit actually does not agree with anything. If someone says + reddit says -. It's funny.
