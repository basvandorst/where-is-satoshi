Your client could either hire a consultant/developer to set it up, or DIY using the coinbase website (trust me it's simple), or you could learn the ins and outs of his existing system well enough to set it up for him.

Good to know! 


That's hard to assess. If your computer's hardware and software is secure, and you're able to communicate with blockchain.info without a MITM attack, you're probably fine. 
To preform a rudimentary analysis of the likelihood of your passphrase staying safe, multiply your estimate of each susbsystem's security together. 
e.g:  
0.99 (99%) safe against a hardware keylogger  
0.97 safe against malicious software  
0.98 safe against MITM    
0.9999 safe against someone standing over your shoulder  
0.9999 safe against electromagnetic eavesdropping on your PC     
0.999 trust in blockchain.info    
    0.99 * 0.97 * 0.98 * 0.9999 * 0.9999 * 0.999 = 0.93996 (94% chance that you're safe)

Both coinbase and bitpay assume the risk of a doublespend for their merchants. Your risk exposure is zero. 
As an aside, the risk of doublespend on a sandwich transaction is nil. If a doublespend ever does happen, it'll be used to buy gold bullion or another high-value liquid asset.

That's a fact. At this point in its development, someone who doesn't understand it *should* feel wary.  Telling someone they're right to be suspicious makes them feel good and keeps you from being in a position of directly challenging their beliefs.

It sucks, but that's the way it is.  
I feel bad for your loss, I really do. But I also understand how little control Coinbase has over how its users secure their accounts and computers.  It's not easy to do a good job of security, and it's not your fault or coinbase's. That's the state of things in 2014.

There's always going to be some disagreement about mod policy. It's a bit more visible now because the mod team has tried some things without warming the community to the idea first.  Basically, users freak out and assume the worst when they're surprised--even by a small change.

Run a MD5/SHA checksum on the liveCD image before burning it, and on the paper wallet generator before running it. Make sure they match the expected values.
To determine the expected values, look up the checksums from multiple different sources (e.g. the author's website, a forum, and github) using multiple different devices that connect to the internet in different ways (e.g, once from your phone's 4G modem, once from your home PC, and once over a VPN or TOR conneciton at a coffee shop)
If the checksums pass this test, you can be fairly sure you've got the software you think you have. 
In fact, this is almost over-the-top security. But if you've got $500,000 in coin, by all means spend an hour checking your software..

There are some considerations of minimum tx size and tx fees that would need to be taken into account.  
I think the way to go, if you decide to do something like this, would be to allow people to opt in to the payout (rather than paying out to every address) and publish the expected payout.  So if you can attract 10BTC of donations (how to do that is a different question) and have, say, 100 people signed up, the expected payout of 0.1BTC will definitely attract more participants.

Better to simply explain what bitcoin is and how it works, and let people decide what's a benefit or shortcoming for themselves. 
Just about any aspect could be good or bad depending on your goals. e.g. the transaction fees (or lack thereof), the mining process, the lack of chargebacks, the public transaction ledger, decentralization, the regulatory environment, the exchange rate, etc.

Replacing ohmic heaters with miners is not only viable, it is ideal.
However, you don't want to switch the miners off and on as you'll eat into your profits and lose about 1 minute of mining at each boot.  Instead, figure out your average power draw for electric heating and replace with just enough miners to run a 100% duty cycle. 
For example. if you have 4000 watts of electric heat in your home and your heaters run for 30% of the time, that's equivalent of 1200 watts running constantly. 
Antminer S1 is roughly a 400 watt device, so you'd need three S1's to reach 1200 watts. This will produce the same heat and consume the same amount of electricity as your oil heaters. 
Since the cost of acquiring miners is high, it is uneconomical to purchase mining hardware that you won't leave running 24/7. Instead, leave an oil heater in place to cover any extra heating you'll need when it is cold out.

Information can be aggregated and analyzed to identify patterns of activity, which could then be used by a hostile party to plan an attack.
Suppose an exchange has an office in Paris. And suppose that every weekday around 10:00 GMT, a large amount of funds are moved from one address to another. But occasionally, the 10am transaction doesn't occur on time, it happens a few hours or a day later.
An attacker who is "casing the joint" notices this pattern and wonders what it means. He does some more research and realizes the days when the transactions don't occur on time are also days when there's a bitcoin conference somewhere in the world. 
He infers that the transactions are being made by a single person at the exchange's Paris office, and that this person attends conferences in a different time zone. 
With this info, the attacker might have enough to learn who is authorizing the transfers, where the victim's loved ones sleep at night, and even what time he'll be at the airport in Rio de Janeiro, looking for a taxicab...

But in both cases, new extraction technologies have increased the effective supply and rate of production. 
Helium is a closer analogy, but better spaceflight tech will increase its supply too. It's the second most common element, behind hydrogen. 
Uranium is perhaps the best analogy, because its supply is fixed, our extraction technology is already well developed, and there is damn near zero uranium to be found in space. We are exceptionally lucky to have lots of uranium laying around the planet.

It is more difficult for people to parse a small decimal than a large whole number. Most people can't scan it left to right in one glance and determine the value of the number.  consider 0.000541.  You scan left to right and get the "541". then count back towards the decimal to figure out how small that number is. An ungraceful mental exercise, and I generally love numbers.  Grandmas and the uneducated would probably have it worse. 
Quick! Compare the value of these numbers: 0.0005410,  0.0000541, 0.000541, .00005410
Now compare these:  541,  54.1, 5410

I've never heard anyone call a bitcoin a bit. 
Microbit and millibit are in no way common words. Step outside the bitcoin bubble and people will have no clue what those words mean. 
Ask a normal person what a bit is, and they'll say it's a small amount of something. Bit as a small amount of bitcoin is consistent with the word's common usage.

It's safe on coinbase, as long as you have keept your account credentials secure. Can you answer yes to the following:
only accessed from a malware-free computer?   
using 2FA?   
strong password?    
unique password?
If that's all yes, you're probably safe.

This change is needed.  
It will do more than bring the value of a unit in line with what humans are used to*. the process of change will establish a precedent of improving the end user experience, and will make future improvements easier and smoother. 
Delaying this change too long would not only hinder adoption, it would hinder the ability of the network to make other improvements in the years to come.

Sorry for your loss :(  
Check your account settings on coinbase and see if there are any sessions from unknown IP addresses. 
Definitely let coinbase know what happened, so they're aware of attack vectors. several of the mods of are with the company, so you could message the mods there. If you can isolate which IPs weren't yours, include that info.

ACH information is the same info that's on every check he's ever written, so he should vet coinbase like he vets anyone who he writes a check to. 
Or if he wants to be extra careful, he should research who is involved in the company, how it got to where it is today, and who its investors are. (hint: it read like a who's who of the silicon valley tech community)

Try to understand that whether the base unit of a currency is worth a penny or a million dollars, $20 worth is still $20 worth. 
Or if it would make you happier, keep track of your bitcoin in mBTC (1/1000 of a bitcoin) or uBTC (1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin) ...so your $20 is .024 BTC or 24 mBTC or 24,000 uBTC, whatever makes you happiest.

While true in principle, the amount of energy that's not converted to heat is vanishingly small. Upper bounds on non-heat energy from a current-gen 1000 watt mining rig might look like this:
RF energy escaping the home if using WiFi, less than 0.5 watt. (lower still if WiFi not used) 
Photons escaping the home, less than 0.01 watt.
Ohmic heating of datalines outside your home, less than 0.1 watt. 
Kinetic losses from sound escaping the home, less than 0.1 watt. 
Over 999 watts are converted to heat.

You can verify that the OS is giving you proper results by a similar process --check the same file with several different machines.
