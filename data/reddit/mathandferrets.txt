I'm pointing out what I think is a gap in the legislation. As mathematics researcher, who observed a ridiculous amount of legislation brought down regularly on pretty much every single science  department at most american universitys except for mathematics? Yeah I'm going to say something when legislation is poorly worded so as to be overly broad.
If you think the intent is clear, but the wording just needs to be tightened up, then you really just don't understand how badly governmental regulation can be implemented, especially when it comes to small businesses and scientific research. There's almost no regulation for large businesses, and if you're transmitting money internationally on a large scale in order to help launder money for drug lords, there's no regulation whatsoever. When it comes down to it, fucking over university students and small business owners is really easy policy to implement, and the politicians can point at saying "see? Our policies work! We nabbed 18 unlicensed money transmitters last year making their own cryptocurrencies! " when in reality they're doing absolutely nothing to protect the City of New York against SR4.7 or al-qaeda or money laundering or whatever the fuck they're advertising that their program protects the City of New York against.

People are not always rational. Consider, for example, behavioral economic theory rather than rational economic theory. 
Now, I'll agree with you that we may be on the cusp of some sort of ... decentralized or autonomous system of governance. And maybe calling them "states" would be inappropriate. But we will see regulation within those states, we'll see police, and judicial systems, we'll see these new systems insisting upon protections for the environment, protections for the consumer. 
Without those protections, we'll see meat factories with unknown meat content when workers fall in, we'll see sweat shops, we'll see factories dumping mercury into our streams, we'll see the entire 19th century system of Laissez-Faire economics come crashing down on our heads again. Why? Because people forget history and then log onto reddit saying stuff like "the best system of government regulation is no government regulation!"

I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but proof of stake is certainly a more centralizing technique of securing a network then proof of work, and it's less secure unless you start adding adjectives like velocity and hybrid.

I love hearing and pondering random ideas like this.
Where is the cash coming from? Say, for example, tomorrow you receive 100 BTC. You throw them into a cold wallet. You are now obligated to go invest 100 BTC worth of fiat on the nasdaq or wherever. Where does that cash come from? If the stock exchange drastically changes value the way BTC does, how will you handle the profit? Buy more bitcoin for your cold wallet? Send USD to investors? Buy bitcoin in a hot wallet and send that to your users? 
Is the idea here to lower the boundaries between an average internet user and investing on the stock market? Is the goal to hedge against bitcoin volatility? To try to peg the value of your fund to a certain index in the market? So you can always say "the following half million bitcoin are irrevocably pegged to the performance of Lockheed Martin"?
I love thinking about ideas like this... elaborate on your goals?

The idea that any one unit of anything can be infinitely valuable is a joke in and of itself.
However, there is a significant "first-on-the-scene" value to any new technology. It's how evolution works; you don't have to be the most optimal solution, you just need to be the best solution at the moment. VHS was an inferior technology to Betamax, but it showed up a little earlier and it won. 
Furthermore, it's worth noting that none of the other cryptocurrencies on the scene have dramatically different "under the hood" technologies than bitcoin. Some vary by their Proof-Of-**** functions, and some vary by their hash functions, but they're all the same cryptographic schemes. There are several public key cryptography schemes, RSA and Elliptic Curve cryptography are two, and they all differ significantly in their structure. 
But ALMOST ALL of the cryptocoins out their are identical to bitcoin's cryptographic structure, but with variants in different choices here and there. They are essentially different choices of parameter for the same currency model. That's worth observing.

Alice sends bitcoin to Bob to buy JLaws latest sex tape. She also sends the same bitcoin (that is, using the same private key) to Bill to buy dog food.
Bill and Bob call each other to see if Alice is attempting to double spend. They see she is, and that half the network has decided the sex tape purchase is legitimate and the other half has decided the dog food purchase is legitimate. Which parts of the network decide which transaction is legitimate usually has to do with who saw which transaction announced on the network first. 
To resolve this, they wait a few minutes until more blocks have been processed. Eventually the vast majority of the network will have come to one conclusion or the other: sex tape or dog food. At that point, the failed transaction is rejected.
If you wait, say, six blocks, the probability that Alice has attempted a double spend drops to around 2^-6 which is.... small.

Upvote for visibility!
I create two LLCs entitled "Alice" and "Bob." Bob is always stationed in Germany, or whichever country has the lowest bitcoin tax liability, and Alice is ... me.
Alice makes any and all BTC/USD exchanges, and immediately transfers that exchange to Bob for an identical price; hell, there can even be an arbitrary time delay. Any time I wish to buy a bucket of paint, Alice purchases the bucket of paint for 0.05 BTC, and then sells the bucket of paint to Bob for 0.05 BTC. I, being the sole executor of the corporations "Alice" and "Bob" pick up the bucket of paint and happily walk out of Ace Hardware tax-free.
And this is why bartering is never listed on tax forms...

Every bitcoin is worth equal (market) value up to slippage. The return on investment for older coins is greater, though,  that's certainly true. Is that what you meant?
That's only relevant, though if you are using return on investment as a metric to gauge how much of the bitcoin economy is being moved (as opposed to being hoarded or speculated). But shouldn't we just be measuring "money velocity" in terms of total number of bitcoins moved (not hoarded or speculated), disregarding age?
Edit: I do see your point that the "new btc" population is a small fraction of the "total btc" population and so that article is taking a biased sample. But number of transactions per block per total number of bitcoins in circulation, and bitcoins days destroyed per block, on average, are still going up, too, just not exponentially. That suggests overall circulation is on the rise much more slowly than adoption, which is interesting.

Okay, I was under the impression that we could choose FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average, whichever of the three was most advantageous to us? Why do you recommend not using LIFO?

Uh, no, tragedy of the commons is a consequence of finite resources being used by a community, government or not.

If one or two of the farmers also graze 6 or 7 days a week, the pasture will be fine. If all the farmers graze all the time, the pasture will simply die.

Essentially, but I am only reporting stuff from coinbase, and with a few legally gray exceptions. Coinbase exports everything to a CSV for me. I wrote a python script to parse it.  Anything described as a merchant order or as a buy or a sell, I am reporting, but most of my other transfers were just to random wallets. Except for my cold storage wallet, I am writing ALL of those off as complete and total losses, even if they were actual legitimate purchases because ... well, I never received receipts or anything like that, I don't even remember what I bought,  and so on. 
As far as the IRS is concerned or can tell from blockchain or bank account activity, I could have just thrown bitcoin away down the metaphorical toilet, or given btc to friends (which I did on several occasions).

Proof of stake is mathematically untenable as a large scale network security method. Look up Andrew Poelstra's paper on it. This is old news. Vitalik is undeniably smart, but he is *provably wrong* about POS being a workable solution. He tends to think very deeply about a subject without seeing what other folks have written on the topic. Consequentially he ends up deeply analyzing problems that are mathematically trivial. 
Example: how to secure a network with proof of stake? Short answer: you can't, really, any dedicated sub-50% attacker can take it down. Long answer, Vitalik's answer: but if we tweak and prod and pull and poke in the following innumerable ways, we can get close to something that works almost as well as POW except a dedicated sub-50% attacker can still take it down.
I prefer the first answer.
Full disclosure, I do the same thing as Vitalik, ignoring other people's work at my own peril.

Thank you for pointing this out. The framework of the protocol itself has enormous regulatory power. Money supply? Check. Chargeback? Check. Protection against double spending? Check.

Not a popular opinion around here, but people forget that systems centralize for efficiency reasons. We probably won't be seeing 3d printers in our everyday lives despite their disruptive and decentralizing power for the same reason we don't see people using laser  engravers in their apartments. 
The disruptive capability of these technologies should not be dismissed and decentralization is great. But our internet experience suggests it won't be a revolution.  It will simply shift the title of gatekeeper away from the current gatekeepers and toward someone else.

Ok, but merchants who cash out euros for USD are doing the same thing, but euros hold "intrinsic value" (whatever that means). Your argument seems to suggest that the euro could act as a functional currency even if it's value collapsed, and that's... kinda absurd, too.
Remember, bitcoin isn't just a payment processing system like a credit card or a paypal account. It's a currency. And currencies DO have a particular intrinsic reasons to hold and retain value. See the regression theorem in economics. I can go on Amagimetals.com and trade my bitcoin for silver or gold or platinum directly. I don't believe they are cashing that out for USD immediately, my impression is they are just holding onto their bitcoin, or at least a portion. Even if YOU don't think bitcoin has intrinsic value, SOMEONE out there does, and that implies the existence of a market.

But, now that you bring it up, speculation as a representative piece of the bitcoin economy is dropping. So it seems folks are taking your advice, either way.

I don't entirely disagree. I have my eye on a few altcoins myself, especially ones that are pushing the theoretical envelopes of functionality. On the other hand, I am confident bitcoin's growth isn't finished, but then again, litecoin isn't done either.
I think the most likely thing? A group of a few banks will design their own coin for internal smart  contract executions, wealth transfer, and accounting.  After all the real value in these coins is the blockchain technology, and this allows a completely automated banking system including automated money.  A whole industry in designer blockchain technology for automating corporate structures is about to fucking explode.

Many of us get our coins through legit exchanges like BitStamp or coin-selling services like CoinBase that require linking with a bank account and a whole mess of identity verification. We just gotta assume Wells Fargo will be ratting us out to the IRS, if not Coinbase.
It's possible to get our hands on coins anonymously via localbitcoins... unless we get ratted out by the other person, that'll be tax-free, nothing the government can do about that. As good as cash. 
Or, a completely unethical, Walter-White-like horrible horrible person could legitimately sign up for Coinbase and then use a mixing/tumbling/lets-call-it-what-it-is-its-money-laundering-service to build an anonymous wallet. They could then claim they got scammed out of their bitcoin, or they sent them to a wallet and lost the private keys or something ridiculous. Nothing the government can say or do about that, either. 
But, really? In the end? I'm going to fucking pay my taxes. Why? Because for one thing, I don't want to be an example, my head mounted on a spike for other bitcoiners to see. I have a wild suspicion an audit is in my future, so I'm just going to play it safe and honest. 
For another thing, I think it's a responsibility in general to pay taxes, even if they aren't being spent responsibly (that's a whole nother discussion). And while I think that bitcoin is the future of money, I'm not exactly an anarcho-capitalist-libertarian type.
But really the main reason is that I secretly hope that bitcoin is worth tens of thousands some day and if that happens, you bet your ass we all better be clear with the fucking IRS. They will fuck your shit up. Look what they did to Willie Nelson, man. Poor Willie.

If there were no limit already and you wanted to impose one, you could simply tell the nodes to refuse to relay any block larger than a certain size; there are already a bunch of checks for the validity of a block, so this is just one more if-then.
On the other hand, another way you could impose a limit is to tie a block's difficulty to its size AND the network hash rate. You could do it continuously or discretely: if size of block is greater than X, then difficulty is 20% greater than usual, or simply make difficulty proportional to the ratio size/X.
In the discrete case, this would (a) cause small blocks go be solved about 16% faster than large blocks but (b) create a difficulty computation that is not as easily verifiable for other nodes and  (c) removes the easy interpretation of difficulty as "directly proportional to network hash rate."
There are certainly other consequences for doing this, though, this is just off the top of my head

His economic policies are flaming bags of dog shit left on the door step of the white house so that if anyone steps on it he can giggle at them while simultaneously scoring political martyrdom points.
Notice that his budget plans only really come out while the government was nearing shut downs and similar situations, and all of his budget plans had a heavy sprinkling of "CUT EVERYTHING" attached to them; they were designed to be partisan and to never actually pass. If this were, say, House of Cards, one could be inclined to conclude he never wanted them to pass and he suggested his budgets solely so he could paint himself as an underdog being held back by the good ole boys in Washington.
Couple this with his disturbingly racist interpretations of our legal system (which ignores statistical evidence), tyrranical ideas about abortion rights, his bigoted ideas about gay marriage (as worthless as they are now), and his outright refusal to even say how old the earth is??

Thanks for sharing the 2015 video, though.

Especially if that hesitation seemed to stem from political reasons, as his did. 
Skimming through the politifact file on Paul, however, validated my concerns about him, though, as a fear-mongerer hyping this notion that the government is out to get us, take all our money, and spend it on frivolous stuff that doesn't really help people. He has jumped all over the hate-obamacare bandwagon, and the Benghazi bandwagon. He plays to this notion that welfare is bad for people, and that most people on welfare are lazy or worse.

I think the trip from under a dollar to over a dollar is a lot easier to make than the trip from under $1000 to over $1000, and similarly for larger numbers... maybe it's an energy argument. Going from 5 miles an hour to 6 miles an hour takes a lot less kinetic energy than going from 50 to 51. Going from 90% the speed of light to 91% the speed of light is trivial compared to increasing from 98% to 99%...

Unfortunately, mixers and tumblers (in some senses) make it easier to track transactions. All the transactions are still occurring transparently, and every additional transaction leads to more information about the original users being leaked.

Why is 610 significant?

Right, I think OP was suggesting that a 610-day moving average was the "last" indicator we just cleared. I was asking why 610 was relevant

Many math constructs are built "like a blockchain" in the sense that (1) they proceed iteratively,  (2) the state at one point is strictly dependent upon previous states and, (3) history is unforgeable/unchangeable . The deterministic version of these processes are often called dynamical systems, and the random version of these are often called stochastic processes. However, if these are sufficient conditions to call a process a blockchain, then every dynamical system or stochastic process may be rightly called a blockchain. The idea that the universe as a big dynamical system or stochastic process is not new, though, and really those constructions more closely reflect reality than a public transaction ledger.
I think it could be worthwhile to look at the process of a virus writing new information to a cell's genome as encoding information to a blockchain. On the other hand, the idea of copying DNA would be harder to analogize with a blockchain; perhaps syncing your local copy of the blockchain or something. And the analogy is fairly weak, but it's stronger than the spacetime analogy.

This is an excellent response. Most criticisms of private blockchains involve an argument along the lines of "if its not secured by a decentralized solution, then it's not secure."
However, a private network run by, say, Microsoft, with all computers on the network owned and operated by the same actor, would be secure. But that's assuming every individual with access to the network has the same motivations, payoffs, and incentives as the conglomerate owner, in this case, Microsoft.
This is why pure security models are the only security models, really.  As soon as you sacrifice protocol X, you have to implement protocols Y, Z, etc to compensate.

Your understanding of the cryptography underlying monero is incorrect if you think monero doesn't offer anything worthwhile, and if you think darkwallet is sufficient to render the technology obsolete, you have more reading to do. I recommend starting with the Monero Research Lab's review of the cryptonote whitepaper at lab.monero.cc

Your answer is mysterious to me. A wall is set at a price, whereas the moving averages are chosen by time frame. Your answer suggests 610 is important *as a price* but OP suggests 610 is important as a parameter computing moving averages.

Chaos theory deals with deterministic but hard-to-predict systems, not randomness. They are still deterministic though; if you know with infinite precision some initial condition, you can still predict the resulting behavior.
This is in contrast with stochastic processes, built from random variables.

Are you kidding? The user above was able to continue trading with a negative balance. Instead of saying "nope," their code allowed that to go on. Programming an exchange that allows that is... Just kinda insane.
You could say "well, bro, stop trading if y'alls balance is negative," but that won't keep scammers from scamming and driving the exchange broke.

I am completely with you. This thread is painful to read; one bro demands evidence of blatant sexism right beneath questions about pink paper wallets.
This reminds me of the posters outside of women's studies departments at universities. They say stuff like "if you educate a woman in undeveloped countries, you educate a whole family." Then some asshat comes and tears the posters or vandalizes the poster with a sharpy with a witless comeback like "what about men, huh?" It's not about excluding men, it's about optimizing the effect of outreach on a community.
I will tell you one thing, from my experiences with small business owners I have spoken with. The bro-types? They don't give a shit about bitcoin. I can make points left and right about credit card fees and being beholden to banks and it's just... In one ear and out the other, because they already have their payment processing worked out and they just already think they know what's best. On the other hand, the women I've talked with about bitcoin immediately perk their ears up when I mention Coinbase's fee schedule for small businesses. 
Anecdotes aside, OP, I fully agree, and all the dumbshits in this thread can go to hell.

As of right now, we are at a one-day, one-week, one-month, and two-month high. Fuck if I know what it means. Maybe we are on the cusp of another bubble. Maybe the recent whale activity is a coordinated price manipulation move. All I know is if you are buying low and selling high now wouldn't be a great time to buy. Unless you are optimistic and feel that past prices can predict future prices and the market has momentum.

Firstly,  hundred dollar swings now are the same as ten dollar swings a free months ago. Think I'm terms of percentages and volatility isn't as much of an issue any longer. 
Second, I don't understand your claim. Are you saying that since the market is vulnerable to manipulation now,  it always will be?  Or that vulnerability to manipulation harms the adoption as a currency? 
Instead of thinking about it as a stock (many speculators on the forex market make the mistake of conflating currency investment with stock investment... do not do this!), think about it as a payment processing technology. Market cap isn't vulnerable to manipulation like market price.  When you look at bitcoin from this perspective,  market cap represents the overall market investment in the technology. From that perspective, growth at this rate is only good.
Example: rate of change of market cap is increasing because, in part, rich Chinese citizens are realizing the potential of the technology to evade capital controls and export their wealth out of China into offshore banks. This is a huge increase in the adoption rate of bitcoin as a payment technology,  if not a currency. Pump and Dump is irrelevant in this scenario.

They don't need to identify you as unique any more than at any other election date - you show up to your usual polling place with your usual proof of identification, and they hand over a paper ballot. After scanning that paper ballot, it'll enter the network, and the transaction will enter the blockchain, tagged with your precinct, the time, and the date (in case you voted early or whatever).
The problem is then ballot stuffing, but that's always a problem.

Agreed. In fact, I think the plural is probably the correct terminology! "Yesterday, I gave Frank 1000 dollar to paint my house" sounds weird. "Yesterday I gave Frank 1.875 ounces of gold to paint my house" is correct, too. Why should it be different for BTC?

I think he might mean that at the very least, rich miners will be able to manipulate currency generation. If the Chinese government or a rich american university mines a bunch of coins then they can spend those coins on bonds or whatever to manipulate future difficulty in a way that favors them but doesn't favor their economic counterparts.
In love with your idea by the way. Very creative. I am going to sit me down and have a think about it

@_date: 2013-11-21 18:34:45
Oh I see; I thought your proposed network would adjust overall difficulty according to bond purchases, or virtual mining power purchases. What you are mentioning is that the network only changes the difficulty only for the purchasers, akin to the current system, not overall difficulty? This way folks don't need to pay for new equipment if they are willing to buy bonds?
