As someone with a holding of .1BTC my reaction is much the same

Can someone explain for someone that hasn't kept up with the drama, why is core so resistant to a blocksize increase? 
From what I understand we need to because we're hitting transaction throughput limitations and without a blocksize increase we're significantly hindering the progress and adoption of the currency, correct?

I get the voting with your feet concept. What I don't get us USAF, BU, Segwit, etc and what that means for the network stability.

I enjoy it, i just try not to get too worked up by the nonsense and enjoy the simple jokes for what they are. Get home from a long day of work, grab some food and watch a bit of relaxing brain off TV.
Alternatively I could just be in the dumbass demographic

By the time I got in I could only afford .28 BTC. I sold yesterday having made a healthy profit entirely in the hope it crashes so I can but more and get closer to one whole BTC

I still have no idea what is going on. BIP91, BIP148, SegWit2x, UASF, corporate takeovers. I'm completely confused. Is the SegWit signalling that's occuring good news? Has bitcoin now been taken over by corporates? What BIP came from bitcoin core?

Sold at £1700. Trying to hold my nerve until we find some kind of bottom. At the current price that'll get me .31BTC. I'll eventually get to one BTC I hope

Oohhhhh. So UASF was an attempt to force through SegWit from the user side rather than the miner side. I knew the acronym but not what it actually meant
