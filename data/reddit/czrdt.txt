As far as personal information has been leaked, bitcoin would not help that much. Rather they need insurance and fraud protection covered by credit card don't they? 
20mil out of 50mil leaking rate is serious anyway.

Very organized article and good balance of advantage and issues of bitcoin. Very different tone from [another Canadian artice.](

Lol. One of the biggest benefit of BTC is P2P without a trusted central authority, or mint. Canadian tire? Oh she is joking. How come a serious economist call herself as Serious Economist?

Yes they can buy at any exchanges. There are less restriction than US banks.

If you convert USD to bitcoin to GBP, the process of the last phase make you loss substantially. As far as it is from a fiat to another. Finding a good bank is better unfortunately.

Good point. Big difference from Dorian.

Yes they can sell at MtGox but they cannot withdraw fiat from them easily now.

You need to link your account first anyway. It takes 3 months or more after validation and withdrawal request recently.
