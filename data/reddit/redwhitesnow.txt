Yes. But in my scenario the change in price is meant to indicate a general one across the board so regardless of how many bitcoins you have at the time of the 'event' afterwards they would still only buy you exactly the same amount of goods and services. 
The value of your bitcoins in the future depends on appetite for bitcoin and it could be more or less. But general bitcoin prices do adjust and this doesn't effect anyone's convertibility into real products.
The only place this question has a real effect on the market is for items that can only be delivered as singles for the lowest denomination that the ledger can handle. So for example someone wants you to buy 1 cob of corn but wants to charge half a satoshi and refuses to sell you 2 cobs for 1 satoshi so the product drops off the market and this has a small negative value effect on the market.

Downward pressure is applied to prices. Generally prices readjust lower. If necessary, the people/market will then come up with different labels for different decimal place levels eg. like this thing will cost you "4 satoshi" = 0.0000000004 or whatever. 
When this happens it doesn't mean that there is any less or more value in bitcoin. So its not inflation/deflation of supply, its just a pricing move that is independent of value. 
Think of an analogy with sea shells (for the last satoshis that couldn't possibly be divided). Well if I were pricing my house at 10000 shells previously then subsequently after the event when there are no more shells that can be mined I realize that by market force I reprice my house to 5000 shells but someone who was selling corn 1 shell per cob would now be selling 2 cobs per shell. See no value difference just a pricing readjustment. The only difference is you can't purchase 1 cob only a minimum of 2. Of course its more elastic than that and in a complex economy it happens slowly and its difficult to track or notice. It doesn't damage anyone much. Perhaps some products that rely on delivery of a single item only for the lowest single unit of the currency. Those products would drop out. But I guess only temporarily.

I think that the way you have calculated it is irrelevant. I figure its not about how many ppl there are its about the quantity and diversity of products available to be exchanged. Prices will just be gently readjusting all the time and there is no way to "run out". The only result is "general bitcoin prices" adjust lower when the BTC supply ceiling is reached yet more kinds of products are trading with bitcoin. If less products become available then prices readjust higher. From these kind of adjustments, the net value of bitcoins convertibility into real products/services remains exactly the same. 
You don't need greater divisibility unless someone wants to trade an item for less than 1 satoshi. In that case they have to send you multiples of the item in exchange for 1 satoshi. Only in cases where suppliers refuse to send multiples of the item for 1 satoshi will there be a real value effect on the market.

Exactly. This is why there will be no shortcuts to the world of maximum freedom and peace. The only path is the one where communities educate and ritualize the principles of Freedom and the Laws of Peace.

I did mean inherent value in the sense that the functionality of the bitcoin protocol gives the bitcoins inherent value. 
@_date: 2013-01-21 05:05:03
Hmm nice points. So you use value as the 'degree' concept. I agree with you. I'll change it to inherent function. Thanks.
This argument reminds me of

I thought FinCen targetted a body that creates virtual currency? Miners don't create bitcoins the protocol pays them in bitcoins in exchange for their mining input.

I know the trust reqd is the problem. But you could keep a copy of the transaction and be the one to broadcast it as long as u don't lose it. Thats why i figured backing up feature was necessary.
The problem i can't think of the solution is preventing double spend. Hmmm

The OP is just plain wrong. In a decentralized system there is not necessarily chaos instead Mt Gox or any body can enforce their own regulations and individuals get to choose. If you don't like Mt Gox go somewhere else. With gov bodies like a central bank there is no choice. Even the bitcoin protocol could fork based on these principles since miners can choose which protocol to work on.

Yes as per you edit my understanding is that the senders private key is compiled into an encrypted form with the transaction. I figured that's how Armory and Electra do their offline transactions. 
So the double spend is the only problem since the payer could copy the original state of their "offline" wallet and make multiple transactions from such copies without the payee having any way to verify if a previous spend occurred against it. Dammit! :)

Yes I know organic fresh food distributor soon to accept bitcoin. Its all going to happen in any industry. Patience. ;)

The loser in a trial pays all costs. If cosys can't be recoveted administrators of justice are volunteers. Healthy transpatents courts have moral authority to demand cooperation/free access etc.
If the Justice System isn't healthy what is the criminal status of the body you paying taxes too?

Oh I see what you mean. But consider that wood has inherent value as a source of heat. I see value being not necessarily subjective if I define the value in a certain functional context. As we know that this certain piece of wood burns well therefore this wood has inherent value as a source of heat. It's not subjective I can scientifically prove that. So, bitcoins have inherent value as a medium of exchange. I do see your point makes sense in cases where individuals subjectively ascribe varying degrees of value i.e. the price of a bitcoin versus a us dollar.

If you factor in a healthy Justice system to your social model the free market problems you identify would be remedied. For example oil companies would be subjected to property rights and pollution would be punished and factored in to pricing.

Although a wallet may be lost and the bitcoins destroyed I don't think it modifies the tangibility. You can have tangible assets that may burn down in a fire. Yes bitcoins can be destroyed. Thinking of them as tangible more closely aligns them with other financial assets that have a similar range of risk exposures. It helps when teaching others to use this label for them to compare. Thanks for you long comment. I posted in order to get feedback on the topic in order to help my thought process and detailed responses are greatly appreciated.

I admit a bitcoin is not tangible in the sense that you can touch it but look up "tangible asset" or try 
Compared to other instances of tangible/intangible assets in finance terminology, a bitcoin is better classified as a tangible asset. Although you cannot touch a bitcoin, the bitcoin network is difficult to destroy and therefore it's physical form is the physical internet.
