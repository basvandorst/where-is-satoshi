ok, so back in college when i bet on sports there were websites where you could track public money on each side and the movement of the spread over time. Are there similar sites for watching futures prices?

It’s basically the eastern hub of the US military. With the right connections I’m sure power profitability could be managed. Power would have to be outrageous for you not make money off the top hashing bitcoin miners right now with the skyrocketing price and fees anyways

“Looking beyond 2018, adoption of blockchain is powered by millennials and outside the US," said Lee. "Millennials are the largest population cohort at 96 million and are now just entering their prime income years — surveys show millennials have low trust in existing financial institutions and we see this demographic driving adoption."
I especially liked this bc in my personal completely nonbias opinion on of talking to friends and relatives the only people really interested in crypto have been millennials and younger. All the boomers and gen xrs I work with either see it as tulips or a lottery ticket at best. Most have never heard of it

 I’ll be interested in seeing what the price does from 17 forward. So far it’s up 20%. It’s also interesting that bitcoin hit an ATH on almost the day the largest futures exchange opened if I remember right.  If the upward trend continues from here I’d be interested in finding the amounts placed on which side of futures, in the future.

I’m less inclined to believe his version of events (he smarted off to tobacco and firearms officers so they took him down) now that I’ve seen him lie repeatedly to suit his needs. Does anyone corroborate his story? the sentence seemed severe so does that mean the judge was out to get him too? Opportunistic snake

I can’t answer that personally but I do know there are billionaires out there who seem to accumulate more wealth not less. Why sell what gets you to the party in the first place? I personally believe bitcoins value is infinity. I believe there will come a point in time where a dollar is worthless in btc terms so why would I ever sell bitcoin unless I need it. I don’t need extra USD for anything. My kids kids may need my extra btc one day for something important though.

So say the US goes negative interest rate? How do I get some of these negative interest loans? Can I take a loan out and buy bitcoin? I have a great credit score!

It’s actually hardest to sell at the top. The fomo of a bull market is insane when you actually get real money involved. Also consider that last time 10-20k was 30 days. I remember thinking it may not stop until 100k if ever. 
What happens if you do manage to sell at 100k and it goes to 300k. What if once it hits 100k governments take a portion of the coins as a reserve. Once that happens they open up retirement funds to invest trillions pumping their bags. Where does the price go if that scenario plays out. Believe during one of these cycles something like this may play out. Could you live with yourself if you sold at 100k then runs up in the millions over the next year? I couldn’t so I’ll just keep stacking
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:17:19
New ATH before next halving. 100-300k next top. 30-70k next bottom.

The more antagonistic China is to bitcoin the better imo . When the world truly wakes up to what that government has been up to over the last century they’ll want it destroyed. When bitcoin is strong enough it could strip their power and free the Chinese people. It’s a totally captured state as it stands now though. So the weaker chinas stack is the better. Let them keep stock piling gold.

These two were surprisingly positive and informed on the topic. Some others seemed that they were interested but not so well informed. Some others used the time to politicize and attack on things unrelated. Elizebeth Warren was gross. Shelby was lost and confused. 
If this was an example of America’s future stance on bitcoin it’s looking very good 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:24:19
So in this future bitcoin has solved the bottleneck while remaining decentralized and kept its network effects. If that’s the case why would it only be worth 40x. That would make it eat gold but why would it stop at gold? There’s 100s of trillions in assets out there that would be poorer investments at that point. No asset would appreciate like a bitcoin with those properties.

I’m talking about to the costumer. And I’m all about a good hodl but when it comes to the business that’s not always an option. And my employees would freak the hell out if I said I was gonna start paying them in crypto ��

I have no evidence but it seems to me as soon as the tether/Bitfinex scandal started to come out the price went straight up. Could this not be from people that had a lot of the money stored in tether waiting decided it might be safer to move out of tether into bitcoin.
 Now the binance “hack” supposedly its only 7k btc that they’ll be replacing. Where are those coins gonna come from. I think CZ keeps the safu funds in BNB or whatever that  shitcoin is called. Could this not also be influencing the pump.

I’m forced to pay into mine. I have no faith in it. I’d cash it all into bitcoin today if I could. Those losers handling ours have only beat the market 1 year out of 8. Thieves

@_date: 2019-05-16 15:14:35
I agree. I plan to start unloading at 80k and then every 10k on up until most of my holdings are gone If this goes as planned I’ll buy back in the 30-60k range. However, if it plays out like this it will be an entirely new ballgame. Every oligarch on the planet will have their eyes on this space after something like that so who knows what the plan will be

I’d have my broker executed if she announced to the world of my plans to buy 25% of the bitcoin.

I hope it’s not another hit job. Girlfriends dad (retired judge) watches this show religiously. He knows nothing of bitcoin other than headlines and I’m not gonna preach to him about how just about everyone’s got it wrong. I figure next bull market he might get interested bc he seems to be very involved in his other assets.
 I’d love to pick his brain about traditional investments/wealth preservation and would feel much more comfortable about it if I had something to give him in return.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:55:59
All other assets are just different versions of the shitcoin casino. Bitcoin will crush them all over the next 50yrs. Until they are priced in bitcoin they don’t have any value. 
To me the idea of bitcoin gives me hope in the future of civilization. Devaluing a currency through infinite printing is the greatest evil on earth. Most of what people think of as evil is only possible bc their governments have unlimited funds. That makes bitcoin priceless to me so I’ll buy it at 1 dollar or 10 million as long as I can buy with shitcoins like the USD.

It really will be interesting one day post bitcoinization and there’s a legion of hodlrs who’ve survived many cycles. They’ll be the most sophisticated investor class in history bc they’d have survived the most volatile asset in history with more shitcoinery, confidence men, exit scams, and outright theft to take their stacks than any asset class ever.
If bitcoin succeeds this class of people will drive the world in whatever direction they please.

One of my accounts blocked a cash app transfer once. I went through another bank. If that would’ve been my only account I’d have gone and had a talk with the bank. Square is a fully regulated and publicly traded company. Your bank has no valid reason to stop that transfer.

DCA in the bear market. DCA out the bull market over and over until the market cap is so large that these huge swings in price stop.
 If you get caught in a bad position be prepared to hold that btc for atleast 210,000 blocks. No one has lost money yet doing that, doesn’t mean they can’t. Don’t play this game with money you need to survive bc you won’t be able to hold of you do get caught. 
Be sure which market cycle you’re in. There’s 10x in price difference before I’m selling/buying. timing the market can get you wrecked bc there are whales out there that can move it in every way they want and they work together and theres a lot of them out that haven’t even started playing in this asset class yet. They will soon

I live in the most heavily armed population on earth. I’m well familiar how the central banking cartel confiscated and manipulate gold. The US government never had the ability to legitimize gold. Gold has been legitimate since before Jesus. However gold is not easily stored, transported, or verified. Bitcoin can overcome all these things. 
When it’s price gets up to 6 digits the central bankers will know this game is for real and we’ll find out which governments are working for their people or which are totally controlled by the globalist banking cartels. The governments that promote the freedom and trust that bitcoin gives will prosper and the ones that don’t will be punished. 
Noone is taking my bitcoin by any other way than force. Bitcoins been around for 10yrs. In internet terms that may as well be a hundred. You can’t put this genie back unless you figure out how to cancel the internet itself.

The act of the Bulgarian government owning bitcoin helps its people no matter what they do with it. By doing this they are helping to further legitimize bitcoin. If it’s adopted globally that means the those people will be able to store their personal productivity in a sound money for the first time in their history. A money the government will not be able to steal by printing more of
