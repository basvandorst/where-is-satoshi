I linked her to it. I also tweeted to MD about her. I'm proud. I've been a huge bitcoin believer for the last few years. So cool.

Big Hur Dur on my end guys. Account is safe and I promise to donate 100% of any funds to EFF. 
On a better note, huge props and thanks to Scott for working his ass off on this compilation. Can't say enough about him and his work ethic.
