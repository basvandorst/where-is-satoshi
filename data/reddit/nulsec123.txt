The unhealthiest source of hope you can possibly choose. Please go see a psychiatrist if what motivates you in life is an extremely volatile asset that may or may not capitulate or moon any second. Please go see a psychiatrist if gambling on such an asset so you can one day bathe yourself in material pleasure gives you optimism. You might just have a gambling problem. I'm assuming that if bitcoin doesn't exist you would be an empty cynical hopeless husk of a human being.

That is not a reason not to diversify. That's just an observation of the current state and you can't use that to predict the future especially when it comes to a market like cryptocurrency. You can make all the correlations but in the end all that matters is the quality of the product. With your strategy you can make the same correlation that all the low market cap internet stocks followed the high market cap internet stocks ( Yahoo) during the dotcom boom, but look at where Yahoo is at now. You can't predict what will happen in the future using market patterns you are observing now. You can however predict what will happen in the future based on fundamentals like the technology. However I'm not saying that bitcoin is more or less advanced than any of the alts, that's besides the point. The point is using market data is not a viable way to assess risk. I can also make a correlation that in a bull market bitcoin always loses market share to alts which means given enough time bitcoin will lose all market share, you see how easy these correlations can be made.

This is why most of the art the crypto community produces is so corny and tasteless. Also the reason why I believe crypto will never have a bullrun again because people here are so out of touch with modern day culture and are unbelievably stuck up. All in all, the cringy neckbeardness of this community lead me to the best financial decision i ever made in my life, shorting bitcoin.

You are not funny and you will never be funny. Go out and exercise you overweight fuck. Go make some friends instead of hallucinating things while looking at crypto charts all day. This is why crypto will never have a bull run again because mountain dew drinking cringe lords like you who think they can be a millionaire without working are still in the market. I bet you say meme quotes in real life. How in the actual fuck do you see Marge dancing, even on a meta ironic level I can't understand this as a joke or as a serious observation. At least the Bart one is understandable, this is just Boomer retardation.
You either look extremely frail or extremely fat and pale. There's no way a normal looking person can produce this type of autism in an already autistic cringy subreddit. The candlestick graph is suppose to represent some sort of maturity and the cartoon drawing used as technical analysis is suppose to represent youthful playfulness/irony. I see this type of contrasting ploy used everywhere. It's basically saying "Take me seriously but don't really because I'm too stupid to explain anything if you dig any deeper into my knowledge of the subject." It's basically the  equivalent of sayinf "TFTI" afterwards when you didn't want to go in the first place.

This is why I keep my crypto on exchanges. Last time coincheck got hacked I got a refund.
@_date: 2018-09-23 05:14:54
Just leave it on a large exchange like binance and provide your identification so there will be some sort of insurance during a hack. As long as the exchange is reputable, most likely you will get your money back in case of a breach. This isn't the MTgox days anymore. If you do not know what you're doing I don't recommend storing it by yourself lots of things can happen in life in a span of few years, I would trust it in the hands of professionals who have to maintain a server 24/7/365 with account retrieval services, customer support, and reimbursement in case of a hack.
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:35:56
It's working great because when I'm in Hong Kong I hear no one talking about crypto or bitcoin. Nor do I see bitcoin or any other crypto accepted anywhere. Oh wait its because they already use octopus cards and alipay which is 1000x effective. But what about my decentralized!!!!
If you can't even trust your own government to be on the side their own people and to protect your own national interest then creating a decentralized censorship resistant currency is the least of your problems. To me the creation of cryptocurrency is just a reaction to the failing state of the West and the rampant distrust and anarchism that is gaining a foothold in western countries. Everything block chain can do a traditional server can do with 1000000x efficiency. This is only a question of whether you trust your government or not and if you don't trust your government then you have bigger problems to worry about outside of magic internet money.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:56:05
Winner takes all is an even bigger reason to diversify because there's a chance that bitcoin won't be the winner. Most people diversify by putting 90% in bitcoin and hedging against bitcoin by putting the other 10% into a few other alts that may replace bitcoin. Are you seriously going to listen to a quote Mark Cuban said in a video. For every rich person that says don't diversify there's 10 more that says diversifying is good. People these days use inspirational quotes to formulate their investment strategies because they have the attention span of a gold fish who can't sit down and do actual research on the benefits and trade offs of diversifying in different types of markets.

Just like how ethereum and cardano consensus work, if you have more money the more your vote is weighted. If poor people can have the same power in society as the rich all systems would be fucked. The world would literally collapse if we didn’t have rich people to influence law and governance. The deep state is suppose to be a buffer zone between order and tyranny of the masses. Right now the most pressing issue is how to build a secure consensus algorithm and to them it’s not even a debate, if you have more money you should have more weight in the network PERIOD otherwise the network will be compromised by malicious actors instantly. This is just how the world works. Money is a form of trust society has bestowed upon you so of course the rich will be able to influence law and blockchain protocols.

well we realized gold is inefficient as a currency because people ended up hoarding it from the lack of inflation. so we created fiat currency so we can do things like give loans and force people to actually invest and use their money to beat inflation. Fiat was the next evolution of currency, gold was archaic. fiat will always be needed even if it means fiat becomes a derivative of bitcoin instead of gold.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:04:57

I consider inflation as a payment for the services that fiat gives us.

We need some sort of inflation otherwise when we reach full adoption we have some wallets that literally are going to hold 5-10% of the entire worlds wealth. How would you feel if some hacker from the early days of bitcoin now owns 1% of the wealth of the entire world or some early Silk Road user now has .5% of the entire worlds wealth.

That’s literally not the state of affairs right now. In fact btc is less evenly distributed than fiat as of now. If .0001% actually control 99.99% of the worlds wealth than literally 99% of that wealth would be unspendable because value is derived relatively.

But then that defeats the purpose of Bitcoin if they shake it out of the retail crowd because then it’ll never be used as a currency and they’d be going against they’re own interest.

At least have an inflationary currency pegged to bitcoin. Or have a inflationary token smart contract on bitcoin rootstock.
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:10:53
But the problem is the mentality around bitcoin and other currencies where people somehow believe a deflationary currency will solve wealth inequality.
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:08:51

I hope you people know you are going to be responsible for creating the new digital oligarchy that will be impossible to dig out because of the finite supply.

@_date: 2018-06-04 22:24:28
Except it’s finite. So people won’t use it like normal when it comes to investing because the risk of the investment would be higher than just holding bitcoin. Even if it reduces investing by let’s just say only 10% this can have a catastrophic effect on global money circulation and economic growth. It’ll be harder for start ups to collect seed money instead people will only invest in safe and already established businesses. The reason why people invest today with fiat currency is because just holding fiat is a risk because holding fiat is a liability through inflation. If bitcoin becomes work currency with 0 inflation then it basically becomes a risk less investment and it will decrease people’s tolerance for risk. Now people will only invest in already established business because they have less risk. It’ll only make the rich richer.
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:52:58
But by the very definition of inflation it makes all money less valuable. What reality are you talking about. It’s the literal definition of inflation. 
It’s seems like you’re just disagreeing with me now just to disagree. You’re basically disregarding the literal definition of inflation. Does 1+1=2?
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:09:30
People will soon realize bitcoin is going to be a tool to be used in the future surveillance state and establish the new digital oligarchy. It’ll make the gap between rich and poor even greater because it’s non inflationary and people are just going to hoard bitcoin and never use it or use it to invest. Just like how Kings and Feudal lords hoarded gold until the invention of Fiat Currency changed the world forever by giving the power back to the people by allowing average citizens a means to build wealth and have a chance against the old world money because through inflation it creates competition. We need a crypto with some sort of inflation to debase the value of the crypto oligarchy.
None of you see we are actually going backwards. Bitcoin is going to make wealth inequality even worse. Being finite is not always a good thing. Imagine bitcoin becomes world currency today with the current bitcoin distribution, the average citizen would literally become slaves.

So you think a non inflationary currency would be better?
Now the rich won’t even have to worry about their currency debasing and it’ll be harder for new entrepreneurs to capture market share. 
Inflation effects all money the same, the average citizen doesn’t pay for inflation. Check out wealth distribution before the invention of fiat currency, when we used precious metals with scarcity as our currency.

But inflation doesn’t make the rich richer and the poor poorer. They make both parties poorer. The wealth gap is caused by other things like unequal opportunities and barrier of entry to starting businesses. Without inflation these problems would become worse. Inflation is literally just a debasing of currency at a certain rate,all the economic policies of a government to create wealth inequality has nothing to do with inflation.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:46:09
Yes my model has been tried for thousands of years and look at how far the world has come. It’s not about cryptocurrency it’s about inflation. I have no problem with crypto currency I have a problem with so many people believing a capped coin supply is going to somehow solve wealth inequality. Inflation is NECESSARY. We need cryptocurrencies with uncapped supply. Inflation rate set by decentralized consensus.

I’m talking about if hypothetically bitcoin is the world currency and there are no more inflationary currencies like USD. The premise of the argument is about what would happen if we only had deflationary currencies instead of inflationary ones. So just imagine how the economy would react if there was ONLY deflationary currencies like bitcoin. And how it would effect things like currency circulation and wealth distribution. The very reason bitcoin is extremely unevenly distributed right now is because the fact that people hoard bitcoin as an investment instead of an actual currency. Think about how hard it will be to repay a loan if the currency you have to repay with is constantly increasing in value. And loans are the engine that drives entrepreneurs to build businesses. We need a cryptocurrency with decentralized inflation

So you’ll have to scrap the report because it doesn’t fit with your cryptocurrency agenda. Let’s be real here, you don’t really care, you just want to get rich and let the late adopters of crypto be slaves while you get rich off their backs.
Disgusting. At least the employees of central banks worked hard all their lives unlike you crypto shills. Do you think it’s feasible to reach global adoption if some wallets right now own 1-2% of the entire supply. Imagine a single person owning 2% of the worlds wealth just because he bought in early. Didn’t even have to create anything useful like a business. Also some hackers own .5% of the max supply so if bitcoin reaches global adoption some hackers and scammers would literally own .5% of the entire worlds wealth. This is also the reason why inflation exists. It keeps people competitive(investing and building businesses) instead of just holding their money in savings doing nothing with it.
Lastly satoshi would own almost 5% of the entire worlds wealth. An unknown entity who may or may not be malicious now owns 5% of the worlds wealth. Good job.

Well that’s just how reality is. If you have more money during a Great Depression you can survive for longer but that has nothing to do with inflation. If the rich decide to keep their money in times of economic turmoil then that’s just how it is. It’s their money they can do what they want. That’s more to do with the economic policies of a specific country that caused this massive income inequality.
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:09:14
Because if everyone’s money becomes more and more valuable people will just hoard their money instead of actually using it to recirculate it back into the economy by investing it in new businesses and innovation.

Well no, fiat has value because the market decides through interactions with different countries, businesses, and individuals. Which is consensus. If the governments can decide the value of currency then we could literally fix all our problems by continuely printing without devaluing our currency because the government can just lock the price of their currency indefinitely. But in reality every time money is printed the value has to decrease no matter how much the government tries to mitigate the effects of inflation or deflation. The government can maybe only effect about 20% of the actual value of their currency but you have to remember the government is also decentralized by the fact that it’s made up of thousands of individuals with different economic views so they also have to come to consensus of where to take the economy. As we can see many coins are starting to adopt this DPOS consesus model because it’s modeled after similiar organizations like traditional western governments and corporate structures. These traditional consensus structures works so its being adopted into a digital form in the form of delegated proof of stake , staking pools, node federations, mining pools etc etc. The government officials aren’t there just by birth right they’re there because of meritocracy and most blockchain protocols mirror that type of power hierarchy either through DPOS POS POW dbft etc. Blockchain protocols are just digitized version of how most western democracies are organized, they work on similar principles of meritocracy and checks and balances. 
The entire world is already decentralized, blockchain and crypto is just taking that decentralization into the digital world. Countries are basically just mining pools within a protocol because they have to compete with other countries. 
Countries = mining pools
Earth= entire protocol
The game theory behind bitcoin is the same game theory behind nation building and global politics. We only think governments are central authority because we are thinking about them relative to the size of an individual but we don’t realize governments are part of a larger decentralized network. Just like how pool leaders are the central figures for individual miners but even the pool leaders are part of the greater protocol and they have to compete with other pool leaders for hash rate share.

Inflation gives the average citizen a fighting chance against old world money. By constantly keeping both parties vigilant by forcing both parties to always try to build businesses and invest in businesses to beat inflation. 
I’m fine with inflation taking my money away because I know that without inflation the rich can just sit back on their stacks of money and never re circulate their currency. The game theory behind inflation is extremely important to running a real world economy that will actually grow.

But inflation doesn’t work like that. Even if you can break it down infinitely any unit you break it down to will continue rising in value. If you break 1 USD down to .00001 USD it’ll still act the same as 1 USD in that it inflates at a steady rate annually.

Over 70% of new millionaires are self made. This percentage has been pretty much on the rise every decade. Idk where this chart is getting its information from but this is the kind of defeatist attitude that will get you nowhere in life. Even if you can’t be a millionaire you still have to try to push. If a majority of people are millionaires than money wouldn’t be worth anything and you would’nt be able to buy anything. Don’t think about money too much, just try your best and if you just happen to become a millionaire then good for you.  Focus on your work, this is how the world becomes a better place. The standard of living for an average person with average income today is already an order of magnitude higher than people living just one generation ago. Stop thinking so much about money, start thinking more about how you can benefit society and the people around you. In just another generation or two maybe our children will be living better than the average millionaire today. The point is stop trying to defeat yourself with this attitude because wealth will always be distributed on a bell curve. Just like how bitcoin is distributed, just like how the USD is distributed, just like how gold is distributed, you can’t change nature.

If the entire world switched to bitcoin the early adopters and the small majority of the worlds population who owns bitcoin (let’s say more than .5 bitcoins) will become the wealthiest people on earth while the rest of the population fight for whatever’s left. Bitcoin has a fixed supply and the majority of the supply already has been mined and distributed so you can imagine what will happen to the price when the rest of earths population tries to acquire bitcoin. The value would skyrocket and we’d basically have a very small percentage of the worlds population owning the majority of the wealth and the wealth gap would be even bigger than it is today. How can a currency be globally adopted if it has a fixed supply and the majority of that supply has already been mined. 10 years is not enough time to fully distribute a currency especially not that of a currency with a fixed supply. 
It’s estimated that only .5%-2% of the worlds population actually owns bitcoin and within that range of people, the majority of the supply is held by very few people, maybe 5000 of the top bitcoin users own 90% of the supply and that’s a very conservative estimate

That’s literally not how inflation works. Inflation is necessary or else people are going to hold currency as the investment instead of actually using money and circulating it by investing it in businesses. This is why you don’t see anyone using gold as a currency to invest because gold is deflationary. Without inflation the rich would just get richer without having to spend their money or do anything meaningful with it and the poor would have a much harder time capturing market share. Imagine if bitcoin reaches global adoption right now, satoshi would literally own 10% of the global money supply and it would never be debased by inflation, infact it would increase in value over time since bitcoin is finite.

Well the second you buy it, then it becomes worth 0. Assuming people keep on finding more and only you are willing to buy it, the price is still approaching 0 because, AmountOfbitcoinleft/Price will always be approaching 0 since the amount of bitcoin circulating can only decrease. If you buy one bitcoin a day at one dollar.
Let’s visualize your net profits as time -&gt; inf using vectors.
t= time 
N = total displacement of your net profits ((svi + svj)+(bvi +bvj))
S= displacement of how much money you made from selling
B= displacement of how much money you lost from buying
Sv = velocity of you selling
Bv = -(velocity of you buying)
Sa = acceleration of your selling
Ba = acceleration of your buying
since you have almost all the bitcoins in the world and no one is buying we can conclude the following statements as true if you buy one bitcoin per day.
Initial velocity of money made from selling = 0
Initial displacement of money made from selling = 0 @ 0degres north of east.
Sa = 0 dollars/day^2
Sv= 0+ 0t dollars/day^2 
S = 0+ 0t+0t^2
S=0 @ 0 degrees north of east
Ba = 0 dollars/day^2 
Bv = -1+ 0t dollars/day
B= -1t+ 0t^2 dollars @ 0 degrees north of east
let’s examine the lim t-&gt; inf for N(t).
If bitcoins supply is infinite your net profit displacement will be negative infinity moving at a linear rate of change.
If bitcoin supply is finite this function would hold true only if supply of btc &gt;0 . However assuming if there is indeed more bitcoin to buy , N(t), your net profit, will always have a negative displacement of at least 1/infinity. 
However, you’re in luck because often times theoretical data doesn’t account for certain variables. By the time you are buying bitcoin for 1 dollar and no one else is buying, there will be no miners. Thus making transactions impossible or of a validity that’s completely arbitrary if you are the only one confirming the transaction.
Proof that it will become worthless under those given parameters. If worth is defined by the value of how much people want something and how much of something there is. Unless you mean worth as something of sentimental value. However even then it would be worthless because you traded obscene amounts of real money for sentimental value. But then again maybe real money doesn’t have really money value to you as an individual.
