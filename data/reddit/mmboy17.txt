I don't get it. If it starts to get out of control you can't pull out? Yeah i'll lose a decent portion but I would lose ALL of it.

Yeah I might just start low and do some more research as I put in more. Thanks!

I don't know whats going on that's why i'm asking people that do. I just wanted to put money in something where it could potentially grow, Bitcoin was the first thing to come to mind.

Well I currently don't have an emergency fund because I don't need it. If a major accident happened, yes I have very reliable sisters that would absolutely take care of me (thankfully).  Also, I believe i'm in a unique situation with my job, there is no way I would lose my job unless a major accident happened. I make around $2000-$3000 a month depending on work, and because i'm 18 I don't have many bills currently ($500 a month). I also don't go out much or buy anything I don't need so it piles up. That's why I thought maybe throwing in a couple hundred a month might pay off in a year or two. I don't know man I just want to invest in something. Truthfully, in my head I was like man if I throw in a couple hundred a month and in a year or two it gets really high again I could make a lot of money. Looking back at it like that I guess it just sounds like a long term lottery.

Ok smart ass.

I'm asking for advice, you think i'm just going to act completely based off what people say here? I'm just trying to look at different opinions, I don't really see anything wrong with that. Especially when I know almost nothing about Bitcoin, before I do anything obviously i'd look into it. So stop being a smart ass.

Kind of impossible for me currently, I do have a great job but it sort of pays under the table. That's why i'm looking at Bitcoin, and thanks i'll be sure to look at those links. I'll start putting in slow and more as I get educated on it.

It's seriously that risky? I don't have a savings account either, I just want to put the money somewhere it could grow. Maybe Bitcoin isn't good for that I guess.
