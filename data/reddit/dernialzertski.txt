I wouldn't necessarily call it a smart move when it's trading at a 100% premium, but at lower premiums it's attractive because you are exposed to BTC gains in tax-deferred accounts that would otherwise be sitting idle.
Trading BTC outside my 401k means I'm subject to 15% cap gains at the very least, over 30% or more at the very worst. Instead I can buy and sell in my 401k without those limitations.

I agree completely. It's a bit of a game of chicken, but I don't mind. Without it my 401k wouldn't be up 1,200% this year.

Don't disagree necessarily, which is why I'm still in. I've been trading GBTC for a few years and it tends to spike like this, hold for a bit, and then the premium typically drops off significantly before the price begins rising again. In either case I'm content with my position at the moment.

My company's 401k is through Schwab. They have something called a "Personal Choice Retirement Account" (or PCRA), which allows you to invest in many other things instead of the typical dozen or so mutual fund choices offered by the plan. It's like a brokerage account inside the 401k. It took a few extra steps to set it up within my 401k, but I'd have missed out on huge gains without it.

I've looked into doing this very thing, but it doesn't make sense.
Withdrawing the balance would require that you claim the entire balance as income, which will drive you into the higher (probably the highest) tax bracket in addition to the 10% penalty. So you're talking close to 50% in taxes. Afterwards, you'll pay an additional cap gains tax on any additional gains from then on.
Instead, you can just leave it in your 401k to continue growing with GBTC. Then you can trade as much as you want without incurring taxes, but still keep your exposure to BTC. GBTC has still gone up a huge amount, possibly even more than BTC, though I'd have to look that up to confirm.

For some people the counter-party risk is worth the tax-advantaged exposure to crypto. If I’d have taken a hard line against derivatives, my 401k wouldn’t be up &gt;1,000% like it is today. It’s not ideal, sure. But truly it can’t be *that* hard to understand.

I'm sure that's a factor, although it's also a holiday weekend, and many people don't like to be exposed to Bitcoin's volatility with their hands tied. If Bitcoin continues to rise through the weekend, perhaps with a confident break of $5k, I suspect we'll continue to see GBTC rise.

Forget about fund management. Blockchain tech has a good chance at making these types of jobs obsolete. Instead, find something productive to do in the crypto community. Find a problem and solve it. Prove that you can create value and you will be a priceless asset to the community.

The downside to being a young early adopter is that you don't have the money to dump into it. The upside to being a young early adopter is that you've got time. If I had to pick, I'd choose the latter, and thankfully it sounds like that's where we both ended up.

The first time it spiked over $30 we were on vacation. I think my jaw hit the floor. It was unreal. And then it crashed hard and I felt like it might just die a slow, painful death, but here we are.

Working on it. Good news for now is that I live in a downtown location, five minutes from three separate fire stations, and my safe has at least an hour fire rating. Still... lol

The term HODL was literally born in Dec '13.

$10/BTC. I bought more than a single coin.
