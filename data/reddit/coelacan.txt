Relative to each other, but price out-pacing difficulty is a good thing for both miners and investors.
You always mine profitable coins, it's just sometimes there's opportunities to accumulate more coins mining when a coin is in a low point in its cycle.

Which is *really* all mining is; rather than buying coins you paid for equipment to generate future coins. Strong coin management is key to the success of mining operation, particularly in GPU mining.

The most profitable coin to mine isn't always the best coin to mine.
Hear me out… If everyone's chasing the highest ROI then you're able to find coins with lower difficulty that just aren't currently as hot [valuable] as the next coin. When their value turns around [and this takes a little trading savvy], you sell, now you've out performed mining the best ROI coin every second ✌️

I’ve had this exact debate with the CFO of my company and we agree to disagree on the subject.
He (and you) believe(s) that crypto/Bitcoin ought to aim for mass adoption using the existing trusted third party frameworks and I think it will be more like the adoption of personal computers or social media, whereby those not raised or native to the technology may never be *good* at it or comfortable with it, but to those raised with the it, it will be completely natural.
IMO the prior model has too many trade-offs for convenience that ultimately erode the full utility of the technology. I’d also argue that there’s little precedence for corporations being able to adapt effectively to directly existentially disruptive technologies (i.e. department stores, video rental, Encyclopedia Britannica, etc.)
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:43:53
It's a little more nuanced that. Deflation is crippling to financial systems that are debt based. If your debts are increasing in value over time, that is very bad. If you can print more money over time and inflate away your debt, that's great in such a system, but there are limits and dangers to that as well.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:19:22
All ways and modes can’t exist simultaneously, in fact some are in direct opposition to each other. 
For example: in a world of *top-down* adoption, one can conceive that personal custody of cryptocurrencies has been made illegal. Personal custody creates the possibility of illicitly shielded transactions and a greater opportunity for loss (e.g. stolen/misplaced private keys). In this scenario *bottom-up* adoption becomes very difficult, perhaps impossible. It is a way and mode that, perhaps by design, stifles the other; making them incongruent to simultaneously exist.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ An S9 + PSU costs &lt;$400 and running node is practically free. It’s not perfect, but if you’ve got a better system in mind, there’s lots of people in the space who would be interested to hear it.

I see where you're going with this and there's a reason why cryptomining is called crypto*mining*; there are many parallels. That said, gold has not historically been currency onto itself, it generally needed to be minted as coins. Mints are traditionally directly controlled by central powers, until now... which is the crux of the message in OP's post.

Bitcoin will never have customer service and if you think it should, you don’t understand what it is. It would be like PayPal expecting a customer service line for USD. With that being said, you’re pretty much making OP’s point. It has larger transaction volume *even* without any customer service. 
Also in the scenario described, there’s plenty of proof of the transaction on the ledger; coming to a resolution should be pretty straightforward.
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:13:33
That makes sense as a hypothetical, but we don’t live in the latter described scenario, so it’s difficult to consider with any level of seriousness.

@_date: 2018-05-27 18:11:34
Your first point is incorrect. Energy consumption is tied to mining difficulty not transaction volume. 
Exactly - to what degree it will become more efficient at scale is guess work. That said,  BTC’s value drives hashrate which increases security in exchange for electrical efficiency; I don’t think there’s a free lunch to be had, but PoS advances may change that.
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:09:56
Cryptocurrency, including mining, is more efficient than existing systems and over time, will streamline and/or replace them. This will create net gains in systemic efficiency; as has been the pattern with previous disruptive technologies.
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:13:55


I find this assessment quite salient. There was a lot of weird negativity emanating from people who really knew nothing about the space. I heard a guy in the elevator talking about how Bill Gates could sink Bitcoin by himself “if he wanted to.” Which is just so preposterous to think… yes, billionaire business people regularly waste their fortunes trying to destroy markets. The worst part was that I could tell he felt smart saying it too.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:27:54
Do you think that’s a permanent condition or a temporary situation? Something that scaling through things like LN and increased blocksize could mitigate in the future. I am of the opinion there’s some unrealized economies of scale for Bitcoin with greater adoption. Also, keep in mind VISA is a sprawling corporation and the entire cost of the company’s function has to be taken into account when calculating transaction costs in electricity.

We don’t know how energy consumption will scale, no. We do know that there’s no coupling between tx volume and electrical consumption directly. You could technically run the entire network as a single fragile node on one measly CPU and it would be the most efficient means of transaction in history by a wide margin.

Bitcoin has its limitations, which is why (beyond Gresham's Law) that I believe there will be many coins when the dust settles. The fees are an interesting topic. I have on authority from Blockstream that not only do they not care about fees, they think fees are an important part of the ecosystem to establish as block reward diminishes. Sure LN is developing, but they envision the main chain to be used only for large value transactions that make the fees negligible as compared to the legacy system.


I think the energy used in PoW is greatly misunderstood, as is Bitcoin as a store of value. The power doesn't just secure transactions, it secures all the coins in the network, hence the store of value. How efficient this is only becomes apparent when one considers the cost to maintain the price of the US dollar in energy, labor and quite literally blood.
If it were possible I'd be all for it, but I just don't expect there's an "energy free lunch" it comes to replacing such a powerful and far reaching system.

This is an interesting topic. I reached-out to my old macroecon prof. about the "priced in" phenomena and economists *do* believe that known events are priced in to assets. In practice I think there are some issues with this belief, particularly with respect to crypto. There's a temporal dimension that's not captured and there are literal impacts from a supply choke. If known events were priced into Bitcoin, halvings beyond 2120 should also be "priced-in" from the beginning; which is just not possible.

There's more than just solely a tech dimension to Bitcoin. Presently it looks like Bitcoin will be akin to USD (or gold from an earlier era) in the way it backs the market, but there are still nearly 200 currencies in global circulation. Gresham's law states that "bad money drives-out good" and from that one can infer that inferior currencies will be more readily spent and than dominant ones; opening the door for additional protocols.
If you're saying there will be only one winner using SHA-256 algo, then I see your point. Unless they adopt merge mining (a la LTC/DOGE), they will be relentlessly susceptible to 51% attacks.

This conversation has drifted off the rails a bit, but I'll take a few more steps down this path.
You're presuming stealing/marauding are products of mental illness and show a "failure to solve problems effectively," but in many cases throughout history these methods were elegant solutions to systemic issues and in some cases brought tremendous prosperity (e.g. Genghis Khan, Viking culture etc.).
What you're describing (without citation) is not neuroscience and our myriad of needs in no way relates to a computer's electrical draw. Even if I were to accept the premise that "humans are just complex computers," your analogy is still broken. I'm in cryptomining and I can tell you from experience that running a server outside of factory specifications, with some knowledge, can yield desirable results.

It's pretty accurate. The earliest evidence of trade over great distances was nearly 20,000 years ago[1]( To pre-date inter or even intra-tribal bartering you need to go back impossibly far.

Such a bizarre take. People act in their own best interests, they don't instantly act like some kind of hive-mind as soon as they've purchased an asset. No one buys stock in, say Amazon, and starts thinking they can move the needle by shilling it to everyone they know. It would be a completely illogical waste of time. The fact is, nothing said here has any impact on the market; 0. You hear people say stuff about market sentiment based on this sub, it's ridiculous. 
People who support Bitcoin are not looking to convert buyers, they believe in it long term. I'm sure there are also shills, but there are shills who FUD the market too.

Coins that are *less profitable* often have lower difficulty. Since in mining coins are earned relatively slowly, I sometimes think it's best to focus on accumulating rather than immediately extracting the most value. It's the mining equivalent of "buying low."
It's possible to switch coins constantly and chase value, but unless you're selling immediately, you're exposing yourself to more layers of risk and there's capital equipment costs to recoup.

Some people keep their wealth a secret to the best of their abilities, others are more ostentatious.
However, there's a big different between having $100 in your bank account and $100,000,000, but neither would be afraid to say they have and use money. Just like there's a big difference between OP's 1.0 BTC and the Winklevoss' 200,000 BTC and the later is quite public about their holdings.

I'll use Slushpool as an example again. In Slushpool individual users are able to vote with their hash which forks (if any) they want to support (i.e. Segwit, S2X, etc.). This is only meaningful because mining is decentralized. If more pools gave miners similar autonomy, the blockchain would be more secure. The economics of mining require that pools be at least ~0.5%-1% of the network, so this will be a persistent issue otherwise.

The following comment will be downvoted:
My intuition is that "proof of keys" is a movement designed by subversive forces to damage the crypto ecosystem. I don't believe anyone who really considers the implication of attempting to bankrupt exchanges would find this is a smart idea.
In the banking system they would describe this action as "a run." Runs create insolvency in banks and are both a cause and an effect of deep recessions.
If there was sizable momentum behind this "movement," which there's not, you would likely find that a number of exchanges don't have enough crypto to cover withdrawals. To what end though? A collapse similar to Mt. Gox from a stress test that chartered banks can't withstand; it's not a thing and won't happen, but to all the non-shills out there this is incredibly dumb.
Note: I am not saying you should leave your coins on exchange for an extended period of time. You should only leave coins you are actively looking to trade and move those you are not actively trading to cold storage or paper wallets. Coin custody is extremely important. My concern is that any monetary system would fail such a stress test with dramatically negative results and crypto is no exception. A gradual move to decentralized exchanges would be the prudent way to accomplish the same goals without causing undue shock.

I definitely agree that exchanges are an issue. Ask me two years ago and I'd say that exchanges are the biggest threat to Bitcoin. That said, decentralized exchanges show a lot of promise and are much more systemically efficient than regulation. But yes, if an exchange is run by humans it should be regulated.
I don't think you fully appreciate how difficult, costly and pointless a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be. Despite what you may hear, mining is incredibly decentralized; it's the pools that are centralized. This is a function of the business of mining, it's not profitable to mine in a pool with a hashrate &lt;0.5-1% of the network and I am not sure that will change. 
For what you're describing, several pools would have to collude and start mining a BTC fork. It's not their hash though, it's the hash of individual miners. So now they're hemorrhaging cash to buy BTC to pay the miners in their pool or depleting BTC reserves. Ignoring the fact that ~50% of the hashrate just disappeared to mine a fork and it would be really obvious who was doing it and when it started. A successful attack would instantly tank Bitcoin value so incredibly, perhaps irreparably, that everything stolen would be so devalued that the entire exercise would be worth less than nothing.
Miners themselves colluding to make their own pool in an attempt to make a 51% attack makes even less sense. Since now they would have stolen worthless coins that were hacked with billions of dollars of now useless equipment. Albeit they would have some front end savings of *only* hemorrhaging electrical costs and not block reward.
In either case, they're arrested for theft.

Perhaps that’s the only indefinite solution, but long term, block reward doesn’t go to zero for well over a hundred years. There are a lot of reasons why it’s not constructive to think of BTC mining as something that would stop, most notably because the entire network can run perfectly fine on a single desktop computer. The only thing that would be different, as I said, would be the relative lack of security.


I don’t mean to be pediantic, but the truth is that miners are securing the blockchain and yes blocks contain transactions. That said, blocks can be mined without any transactions, but transactions can’t be made without blocks.


Coinbase and others pay transaction fees, but the protocol pays block reward.

That’s not true of polling. A random sampling of 5k people is more than sufficient to get an accurate representation of a general population. The challenge in China is that their are 3 tiers of cities and between those tiers psychographics and affluence can vary more greatly than between some countries.
For something like cryptocurrency, it stands to reason that they would only target tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and/or Shenzhen). I am not going to do the math on it, but just within those cities you’re speaking about a combined population of well over 100M, that this poll is soundly reflective of.

For someone like me, there's really no hiding. I work in the space and part of my job description is to represent my company in public. Notwithstanding my personal situation, if the ultimate goal of Bitcoin is to replace fiat, then there is no reason to treat it any differently than owning it's equivalent value in fiat.  
If you have $100M there are certain precautions you have to take as a citizen. If you have $100, no such precautions are necessary. Similarly, holding 20,000 BTC is by no means the same as holding 0.02 BTC. Driving a luxury vehicle or wearing designer clothes is a far greater indicator of wealth than being open about BTC ownership.
