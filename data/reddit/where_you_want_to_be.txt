This sub is so over the top with their "HODL" shit.
It is completely rational for your sister (who is a normal person and not a bitcoin nerd) to see a 20x ROI on an investment and then want to cash it out.  No one ever went broke taking profits.
Not only that, but she's using those profits to invest into the property value of her house.
If you guys in this sub want to attract people to Bitcoin, you should stop bashing the shit out of everyone who sells theirs for a profit.  "DUDE IN 5 YEARS IT'S GONNA BE WORTH 500K MOONSHOT DUDE HODL HODL I KNOW THE MEME TOO SEE?!" is not a rational investment strategy.  
Maybe it's just me but in the last few years this sub has turned into a weird investment cult of everyone jerking each other off fantasizing about what they are going to call their new country when they buy an island with their bitcoin profits, and then trashing anyone who is excited that they made some money in a super volatile investment vehicle.
She's held onto it for 6 years, it's not like she's jumping at the chance to sell it the first time it goes up 3% overnight.
If everyone here is so certain that in 20 years she can buy a house with it, why aren't you guys jumping at the opportunity to buy this BTC from his sister at a decent price?
Most (not all) of the people bashing her for not holding probably own like $500 in bitcoin anyway, and if they actually owned a whole bitcoin, and had the opportunity, they'd be cashing out that $10k in a second, and using the money to buy useless skins on Steam.

Property values are still exponentially less volatile than crypto.

Just sent 1 dogecoin.  Hold for a long time.

Yeah I must have been looking at the Land Bank homes, I guess it makes sense if you want to incentivize people to move there.
Now I am looking at Woodbridge, definitely much nicer.  I was originally looking at abandoned crack houses basically.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:55:41
Is that where this is?  It's a cool looking house, I like it.
Edit:  Looking at houses in Detroit on Zillow and laughing out loud at how inexpensive they are... holy moly.

Bay Area CA here, so I feel your pain.  I spend at least an hour a day looking at 4br houses in flyover states on 2 acres that I could OWN for less than a 2br apartment costs to rent here.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:58:39
I don't get it, how are these houses so cheap?  I mean I know Detroit needs major work, but is the catch just "you live in Detroit?"
There's like 20 pages of foreclosures on Zillow.
Edit:  Alright after 5 minutes of this I can safely say you have the nicest house in Detroit.  Holy shit.

Just keep cranking up minimum wage, surely that will help...  ^^^/s

I'm not sure, I will have to look into what else to use.

Bitcoin is in freefall right now, so I guess now is a good time...
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:27:02
Stick with what is safe man. It sounds like you're already making a nice little profit on BTC, I wouldn't touch the ETF nest egg if I were you. Yeah you might kick yourself later because "oh man I could have made so much money" but you'll be kicking yourself much harder if you lose that money. 
I blew like $300 of Bitcoin years ago that is now worth over 20k, yes I wish I held onto it, but I'd be even more upset if I lost the actual $300. 
Idk, I'm less of a risk taker I guess. Definitely hold onto whatever BTC you have now, but if it were me I would play it safe with my "real money" nest egg.

After watching coinbase "crash" today right before the dip, and then seeing them lock all buys and sells for no reason with no information about it tonight, I'm not going to recommend them to my friends who are looking to buy in. I told my buddy earlier to use Coinbase because it's easy and he's not very technologically inclined, but today really changed my mind about the site, which is too bad cause I've had an account on there for years.

Also, I am sure their T&amp;C exists so that they don't get shut down by the gov't.  I doubt Coinmama give two fucks what you're spending coins on, as long as you're using their platform to do it.  The issue is that they don't want all their hard work to be kneecapped by the gov't when they find out that you're breaking the law.

And use this and other bitcoin theft cases as their excuse to do so. They will claim that they need to get involved and regulate all exchanges in order to “””protect the public.”””

I’d say you’d be in kind of uncharted territory, and if it was like $700, they might not even inquire, but before you file a casualty loss of $70,000 to the IRS, you should definitely contact a tax professional... that’s the kind of thing that the feds are going to look into, especially if that’s more than your AGI. 
(Of course, if you filed a 70k capital gains tax and paid it, they don’t give a shit if it’s real or not)
The other question is, would you file a casualty loss for the value that you paid for the BTC when you originally purchased it, or for the fair market value at the time of the theft?  Knowing the IRS, I bet they’ll make you pick the smaller of the two. 
If you bought a house for a million bucks, and then years and years later it is trashed or the market is bad and it’s only worth 500k, and then it burns down, I imagine the IRS will only let you write off 500k, not a mill.

Yes but there is still huge public perception that Bitcoin is only good for “dark” type of stuff. For the first year or two the only time crypto made t into the news it was tied to drugs, guns, or something else on SilkRoad. 
Kind of a double edged sword I guess.

But did this money actually exist?  If no actual transfer of value happened, then it doesn't really count.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:32:47
Is any money real at that point?  Everything is just subjective value anyway.
But, my point is, you can log into your bank and right click and "Inspect" the field where you balance is, and add as many zeros as you want, but it doesn't mean you have the money.
If a bank just glitched and gave the guy a couple extra zeros, what if the bank didn't even have that much money?  At least with an accidental bitcoin trade, someone actually has those coins. 
If you log into Wells Fargo or whatever and you have $160 trillion in your balance, that money doesn't exist, even the bank doesn’t have that much money.
Edit: it would be like me writing you a check for $4 trillion. Are you the richest person in the world? Or do you just have a worthless piece of paper with a lot of zeros on it. Although you could argue that fiat is the same thing.

Yeah, the feds even kept some for themselves.

80% of college students also signed up for thousands of dollars in student loans they can't pay back.
No one ever said they were good with money...
