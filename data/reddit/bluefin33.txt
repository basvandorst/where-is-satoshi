Happens to most people, its old. He can get it instantly by showing ID
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:25:09
He has the seed and can also log in through his phone without you being able to stop him.

Looks like just another scam exchange that baits users with a sign up bonus that you can only withdraw after depositing something.
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:26:12
Paying express fees at Finex is stupid. 
A regular withdrawal usually only takes around a week, so does an express withdrawal. 
Unless of course you want to donate 1% +60$ to them with every withdrawal. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 07:10:02
Probably both.
@_date: 2019-11-04 07:25:52
Why? Because the numbers aren't anywhere close to correct....
Do you even use your brain before posting?
@_date: 2019-11-04 08:46:34
Well, make that clear then. The error message you get when trying to withdraw the bonus tells you that it is below the minimum withdrawal limit, encouraging you to deposit more.
Is that supposed to look trustworthy?

It's a pretty nice app tbh, also one of the nicest faucets I've seen in quite some time.

Bitmain ahahahaha. That's a multi million dollar company. I guess you would also send money to the CEO of Microsoft.com
@_date: 2019-11-04 10:36:31
Imagine lying so much that you end up having to pay someone millions you don't actually have.

Lmao people still act like news matter. The reality is that some whales decided to pump, nothing more.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:28:48
No offense, but right now that's stupid. I understand why people buy dips, but fomoing in right now just doesn't make any sense.
If you want to buy, take 30% of what you were going to spend and make weekly buys from then on.

Friends&amp;Family can be reversed just as easy.

I've received this message over 10 times in the past 2 months, every time with a different website.
It gets spammed to every decently sized server, even non-crypto ones.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:00:58
A company that is only in it for the money?? What is this world we're living in??!
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:46:37
Why do people keep celebrating these? The fees are insane on most ATMs, I doubt that they really help adoption.
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:28:33
This one could get BIG. 
The way they hand out interest makes it more sustainable, and their site does seem more professional. 
With the right marketing that ponzi could easily go beyond the 2 billion that BCC achieved. Hats off to the people behind it, they're likely going to make a killing.
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:43:30
same for me- and when searching for r/bitcoin it's only 3rd
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:23:10
Bitfinex was fine with my drivers license even though it doesn't have an expiration date. I had to select a date so I made it the max possible, but they seemingly didnt care and approved me within a few hours.
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:00:10
You'll need a bank to actually spend money. 
If you keep your BTC on an actual cold wallet, you wont be able to spend it until you move it into a hot wallet. Otherwise your cold wallet isnt really a cold wallet. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:37:42
Are you saying that you wouldn't invest all your money into 8 IQ? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:05:16
Imagine my shock, how can this be fake. 
I already sold my lambo so I could get in before the pamp. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:57:58
He is asking what you are paying for electricity. 
Because with 5.7$/kwh you'd be 100x better of by just buying BTC directly instead of buying electricity with it. 
I do understand that you see it as a risky investment, but from my POV it'd be a really stupid one if you are really paying that much for electricity. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:24:58
I honestly don't get it why people dont just sign up at an exchange. Whilest it may have taken a while during the hype in 2017, today you'll have your account ready to go with minimal fees in less than 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:16:17
You could send a tx through the Blockstream satelites with a message attached duhh.

Well shit, I almost opened a short on BSV when I was high yesterday. Should have listened to Stoner-Me.
Edit: I know margin 'trading' is basically gambling and already lost a fair share of money that way. But does anyone here seriously believe that BSV is going to rise in value? There's only one future for this piece of shit coin, and it's 0.
