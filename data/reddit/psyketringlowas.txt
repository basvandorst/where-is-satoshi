Yeah! This post isn't memeish and circlejerky enough!

Coinbase controls your keys and IF they decide to support an altcoin/fork (like Bcash), they will have a wallet for you that has the amount of coins you are entitled to. I would not expect any other BTC-forked shitcoins other than Bcash from Coinbase.

Where else can you convert physical fiat into BTC instantly (and vice-versa)?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:19:03
I don't think that's true. Maybe you were thinking of this aspect (which would still require SegWit usage before capacity increases):

Thanks for the insight.

I configured a node yesterday on a VPS with pruning set to 5200. Took a little over 1 day to get to 100%.

Satoshi didn't think so. 
The only way we'd get caught off guard if some advanced computing system was made in secret and deployed specifically to attack bitcoin.

Do you mind sharing with me some of the things they've violated? I wasn't aware they made any other changes other than increasing blocksize.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:13:53
Noted. I was just pasting from the Bitnodes website.

Print a paper wallet and include with the letter or print the private key directly on the letter.

Of course it helps. It helps with keeping the network decentralized, signaling support for protocol changes and ensuring the rules are being followed.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but would this indicate that it is not possible (SHA256 vs. Scrypt)?

I haven't seen anything on against LN.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:08:00
Very cool, wasn't aware of this.

After validating historical blocks, it'll only keep the latest amount based on how many MB you specify, minimum 550MB.

With pruning enabled, the space requirements are real easy.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:33:37
This value relates to miners, not full nodes.

I guess the BCH issue with KeepKey would be irrelevant to the OP since he doesn't currently hold BTC that can be split.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:06:00
You'll want to look at something more supported than KeepKey, such as, Trezor. KeepKey said they'd support BCH splitting a few days after BCH was a thing but they have still not updated the device nor given any indication about when it will be supported. They were also just purchased by ShapeShift, whether this makes any difference to you or not.

Did you find the priv keys or just addresses?

Ah that's right, thanks!

What's to stop those with deep pockets and a desire for s2x from spinning up a few thousand nodes?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:39:03
I followed this very straightforward guide with success:
You could also try the Bitnodes full node script (I haven't tried it):

Since when has there been any high quality post on this sub? 2014?
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:05:19
Good suggestions but clearly going to fall on deaf ears as the moderation team here seems to be unable or unwilling to make this sub usable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:10:53
...by design.

I would very much welcome the deletion of all meme posts. Put them in a different sub and try and recover this dumpster fire of a sub.

Yes but it will also happen with the 2x fork.

I think I'll just downvote and hide yet another incessant and unnecessary price thread!
