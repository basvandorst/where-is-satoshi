That "BCH" code is **NOT** related to Bcash.
This JS code is quite likely to originate from a library for encoding of QR codes.
They use an error-correction code called BCH (Reed-Solomon is a subset of these).
I hate Bcash, but I think he should get his facts correct.

Stop spreading FUD about the crypto part of Bitcoin.
The record for ECDLP is currently a 112-bit curve (56 bits of security), which is far, far away from the 256-bit (128 bits of security) curve used.
No one has (publicly) compromised secp256k1 yet and this is expected to be very hard (around 2^128 work, which is astronomically implausible), but I agree that we should move to something more rigid.
Basically, you're wrong about


Again, the work required for the best ECDLP algorithms like Pollard's rho is around 2^128 for this curve. This is an astronomically large number and doing that much work is just impossible.
PS. It's AFAIK impossible to compromise a curve itself. It may be generated flawed, which could make it easier to compute ECDLP, but one can't break an already-generated curve.

Okay, you shouldn't really trust entities such as NIST (remember the Dual_EC_DRBG drama?)
But find a reputable paper that says that different curves must be used each time.

When Bitcoin was created, Satoshi chose a curve that wasn't and still isn't widely used outside of cryptocurrencies and that should satisfy your criteria above.

Well, their subreddit is full of fanboys who downvote and criticism and label it as FUD, so it's quite obvious you couldn't find anything there.
However, there are multiple reasons why this cryptocurrency is untrustworthy.
See: [this]( [this]( [this]( and [this](
First, it has a central node called the Coordinator which is used to fix up its hopelessly broken PoW system (and this basically negates any decentralization).
Second, the developers were trying to implement their own cryptographic algorithms (which is the worst thing one can do in crypto^graphy), and when they were broken, they have claimed that despite the code being open source, that was a "backdoor so they could shut down any forks".
Even if that's the actual reason and not a lousy excuse (it's probably the latter), that's **not** how open-source software works.
The proof-of-work function is intended to allow low-power devices to compute it, so attacking it with a cluster of powerful computers and obtaining 33% of the network hashrate (which is the security limit, like 51% for Bitcoin) is quite easy, so they've introduced a centralized node which controls the network to prevent this (see above).
Basically, it's terrible and I wouldn't invest anything into it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:55:04

The idea is to view the source code of the page, find the two hex lines ending with &lt;br /&gt; instead of &lt;br&gt;.

A: "L5LemjkwQwnBFHLhYBLpAVFAek"
B: "B8HrgiiejL1
R\xeas\xf6b\t\xdby\x94\x17\xafuH\x8e"
Now, find the line in the hidden div, and find the hex line ending with it:
XOR this with the B, and get
The part starting with "Xdb" is the second part of B.
Concatenate the first normal characters of B, "B8HrgiiejL1'" and the XOR'ed end: "Xdb3hBmTSNhmvWv".
Append this to A, to get:
This is where I am stuck, as the private key is not valid. Can I get a hint?

b = 50fff854cf3e9cd9af82abdd0008ec879363cb27abb2ce353ca27ebe8926df3c
a, when ascii-decoded, starts with the first bytes of b in hex.

First of all, the quantum computers of D-Wave can't be used for Shor's and Grover algorithms.
Also, the quantum computers are more of a threat to the ECDSA than to SHA-256.
While the consequences of the above for elliptic-curve crypto would be fatal, Grover's algorithm (which can lower the security of hash functions) still wouldn't make the SHA easy to attack.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:40:14
That's just a digest algorithm, and even a collision attack on it would not kill Bitcoin.
A preimage attack would, though - but it's extremely unlikely, even the completely broken MD4 (the predecessor of the horribly insecure MD5) requires over 2^100 work for that.
Also, the 2^128 work required to break a seed derived from a 12-word mnemonic is astronomically infeasible, either.

This is a joke, calm down guys. I can generate vanity private keys which obviously are pretty much useless and insecure.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:20:44
They're nonstandard, but they use the same encoding, so they're semi-BIP39.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:28:25
I'd be willing to bet (if only I had the money) that there will not be a feasible (less than 2^100 work required) preimage attack on SHA256 in the next five or even ten years.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:39:32
Then SHA256 would have to get broken first.
However, even if such attack would exist (extremely unlikely), 2^100 is a huge number, you'd have to perform 2^64 work (already a huge feat for a supercomputer) sixty eight billion times.
If the whole Bitcoin hashpower could be targeted at computing this amount of SHA256 hashes (it can't, as the chips are not flexible and only compute hashes of block headers), the required time would be 2^100 / (35\*2\*10^18 ) / (86400 * 365) years, which is about 600 years (assuming that the network hashrate is 35 terahashes per second and multiplying that by two since it's SHA256d (hash of a hash)).
The scaling is already slow, so I doubt there'd be any major breakthroughs in the computational power in 5 years.

Well, 12 words gives 128 bits of entropy and is still considered secure, so I'd say it's not urgent / necessary, but still recommended.

I suppose more people would remember using short mnemonics if the length was easy to estimate visually.

Actually, spending it would be impossible without knowing the script which hashes to the address. Publishing the private key would make building such a script possible.
[This]( proves you correct. But maybe there's a way to do that securely?

Please don't do that. I did not win too, but had found the correct mnemonic in 15 minutes after the initial publication, and challenge  was solved minutes before me.
CoinGate, please publish more puzzles at once, this would be better for the experience.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:45:06
I've managed to solve 
Unfortunately, some smart ass has already claimed it minutes before me.
The idea is that the whitespaces encode an ASCII string of a WIF private key, 1 space = 0, 2 spaces = 1.
Then the bits form the ASCII string.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:06:51
And I just solved  the A's are zero bits and the B's are ones, now split the bit string into groups of five bits, discard the first two, and you get three bits, now calculate a decimal digit from them, append it to string Z, and convert Z from octal to ASCII.

Okay, my first discoveries are that in  the three Is in logos 2,4,8 are of a different shade, thus visible when setting a threshold.
The answers for the questions in the second challenge are "2008, 50, 2011, 170, 10, 2, 256, 2012, 342, 12, 185, 659", is that correct?
Is that related to BIP-39?

Now it's recommended to write down the shuffled seed, triple check it (write it down to two different pieces of paper) and remove the file from the iPhone, making sure to overwrite it.

It appears to be more optimized, and maybe I have missed something if you don't succeed recovering your seed with mine.

Holy f**k, it's locking in soon!
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:09:58
Yes. You will still be able to use the recovery mnemonic (it's BIP39) and if you would need an actual Trezor, it's open source, so such a device can always be made.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:33:07
Can we have yet another clue? Does the script contain OP_IF? Are all the opcodes used in the ASCII range (32-128)?

If he does, he'll start mining Testnet coins to realize they aren't worth anything.

That's 47 million combinations, and the checksum that the seed provides is only a few bits. I can write a small Python script to aid you, but it'd work only if you know an address generated from that seed, as there'd be too many false positives.
