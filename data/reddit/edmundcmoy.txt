How did you arrive to the conclusion on "racist" newsletters and evolution?

I actually know Ron Paul fairly well.  He was on the House Financial Services Committee and I've gotten grilled by him in a number of hearings.  Very tough but very fair.  There might be a link on one of my posts on my website to a spirited oversight hearing where Rep. Paul went after me in a gentlemanly way.  We also worked closely on coin legislation.

Very funny!  BTW, I didn't mean to seem offended or defensive, just curious on how one comes to those conclusions.

Thanks for the input.
I do mean the financial definition of intrinsic value (that it has other uses like industrial and jewelry that supports its value beyond just a medium of exchange).
I consider gold to be more scarce because there is a finite amount and there are physical and practical limits to how small it can be divided up (hallmarking small amounts of gold is impossible and currently there is no other way to ensure its purity).  I know that BTC is limited to 21M and can be divided up to 8 decimal places but I also understand (maybe incorrectly) that it could go beyond 8 decimal places.
Good point on the relative scarcity.  It was the clearest I could be on a point that interested a lot of readers, given the limited format I have to write in.
Thanks for your thoughtful comments.

I just did!

It is mostly administration (hence Obama or Bush administration), but it also has policy making. Lots of coordination with the Fed on demand forecasting, velocity of $, role of cash vs electronic vs digital vs check. Working closely with Congress on shaping legislation. Also a senior executive at Treasury with weekly Secretary senior staff meetings and departmental policy meetings. Read the first chapter of my book American Gold and Platinum Eagles for insight on what it was like.

No worries!  I realize that you didn't know for sure that it was me.  Looking forward to getting to know you.

How can I prove to you it's really me?

Just thought I would give a shout out to all the participants in this spirited discussion.  Looking forward to learning from y'all, sharing my thoughts, and pushing forward Bitcoin/bitcoin.

I'm 56...is that old?  For my generation, its the new 30!  And not much hair, but what's there is black and grey.  I'm very interested in positive global impact, which many opportunities are technology driven like Bitcoin, so I've had to get up to speed.  My value added is a long track record of getting things done in both the private and public sectors, so hopefully that will add something useful to the movement.

Not hacked. Just my thoughts. It's easier for me to share what's on my mind when I'm no longer a public servant but a private citizen.

Many consider me a know-nothing dim-witted retard (especially my wife) but even a blind squirrel gets its share of acorns.

Almost no connection except making physical money, partnering with the Fed on forecasting demand and analyzing payment systems and trends in payments, advising the Secretary of the Treasury, participating in all the major Treasury policy decisions.  Also ran a 2,000 person manufacturing operation in 6 geographic locations including protecting our Nation's gold reserves (mostly in Fort Knox), while delivering $1 billion of profits to the Treasury General Fund.  I also was a cheerleader but no pom poms!
Was a very interesting dinner with Gavin.  He helped me understand the technology and I helped him understand currency.  We both were energized after our conversation.

I certainly would not turn away any Bitcoin!  But, surprise, I already have some Bitcoin and an online wallet, but still looking for a mobile wallet for my iPhone (knowing Apple has now prevented those apps).  Any suggestions would be welcome.

I short, I'm a big proponent of the free market and am growing increasing frustrated that big banks, money transfer agents, and credit card companies are increasing relying on legislation and regulation to keep or grow their market share instead of competing.  Also some have gotten so big, they are now "too big to fail" so they end up getting special government treatment.  Currently I view Bitcoin/bitcoin as an alternative but not a complete substitute because consumers should have a choice and pick what works for them for each transaction.  Maybe cryptocurrencies will dominate and that's OK if they do.
My other driver is how the existing legacy financial system's ability to solve societal problems has peaked.  Bitcoin/bitcoin potential to help the unbanked and financially underserved is huge...more than anything else out there.
Looking forward to more dialogue!  Thanks all for the warm welcome.

It depends.  Check out my comparison between the dollar, BTC, and gold:
