You have it twisted.  Core developers could easily implement unlimited SIMPLE changes and unite the community.  They have refused to do this for THREE YEARS NOW.  Unlimited and other implementations like it are the product of a selfproclaimed core dev team refusing to make a simple change that a large community of users wants.  Its not like unlimited woke up yesterday and said let's divide the community for fun!  Core devs SIMPLY ARENT CODING WHAT MANY USERS WANT; AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THREE YEARS EVEN SIGNING IMAGINARY HK AGREEMENTS AND TGEN BREAKING THEM!!!!!   FOOOOOLISHNESS.  WHITE PAPER SAYS NOTHING ABOUT SECRET AGREEMENTS LET ALONE BREAKING THEM.  FOOLISH.  THIS IS MATH AND COMPUTERS NOT A TALKING GAME.

You like segwit?  It's not activated and it's not part of current bitcoin.  
Join big blocks instead.  
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:35:19
Yes, keep Bitcoin decentralized with Core and only Core!  The center of the decentralized network, the core!
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:00:19
The advantages outweigh the disadvantages in your scenario.  We can agree to disagree.  
I am just courageous enough to tolerate the chaos you describe.  I see beauty.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:54:54
Keyword ATTEMPT (reread op).  UASF is clearly attempting to alter the Bitcoin protocol. (Whether it has a flag day/activation nirvanna day or not) 
IMO we should be allowed to discuss ALL proposed upgrades, popular OR unpopular.  
Classic, XT, extensions blocks, BU etc.  
The rule is quite silly, and UASF seems to break it.  Glad that you are appealing to authority (Satoshi would be proud) in this case, reach out to theymos to steer our community in the core direction.

Core refuses to hardfork and allow new implementations be accepted by the network.  
Rest of the free world takes the opensource code and upgrades it and allows the entire world to have an opportunity to run it.  BU, XT, Classic, extension blocks, bcoin, pretty much every one except for core who thinks they can have a monopoly on the definition of bitcoin.  Find a new dictionary, the community can contribute whether the loosley defined 'core' group that is 'definitely NOT the center or core of the DEcentralized network named Bitcoin.  Fun.

It requires funding to hold views?  It requires funding to discuss more than a single implementation of bitcoin run by a specific group of developers?  It requires funding to support ideas perceived to be against a fabricated status quo in a heavily moderated online environment?  
I wish I had funding.  I am definitely taking offers because I have ZERO funding.  
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:22:49
This!  Agree!!!  Top post this should be it
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:57:56
Segwit has overwhelming support?!  Is that why it was implemented so quickly? Is that why all miners run it?  Is that why there is zero controversy surrounding it?  Segwit as a soft fork has OVERwhelming support.  I thought it was UNDER.

Let's redefine how bitcoin worked since 2009 o that this never happens again, and so that everything fits your narrative, thanks for name calling!  BU for the win!
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:42:45
I thought we were NOT allowed to post anything about scaling.  It does not have overwhelming consensus!  
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:43:46
Classic FTW!
@_date: 2017-04-08 04:46:51
The project is designed with a failsafe.  If developers misbehave, the network can choose new developers.  Years of failed 'scaling' attempts, the network may just choose new developers.  
What world do you live in where you think core can be the sole development group of bitcoin for eternity.  There needs to be a mechanism to guard against nefarious developers and there is.  The longest chain, POW.  
Core, ironic name for a decentralized network!  Keep core to keep decentralization, keep the center!!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:16:03
Hence there is currently SOME benefit to using bitcoin with out running a full node.  Those who run one help the rest actually use bitcoin.  In banking, we don't have the opportunity to have other parties check their work by connecting and running a node like this.  It's a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:29:06
I was answering your question not building an argument.  Answer is yes.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:43:39
We don't have analysis of network behavior after scaling onchain.  Disadvantages are poorly documented and we do not have reasons to not scale on chain now.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:58:17
Well we can run unlimited.  How about that upgrade :/
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:44:10
Ahh, I see.  Well my perspective is that this asicboost thin has existed since the beginning of bitcoin, so we finally found it which is good.  
Now anyone can use it so in that sense it is good.  
Patents may restrict some, but bitcoin can't and should not try t control patent law in various regions.  Bitcoin is GLOBAL.  IT was also built free and opensource, so patents are like oil and water with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:55:43
Spending time on this silliness?  There is a blocksize to increase!  This other chains be knocking with larger throughput.  Time is ticking. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:43:09
There are many many who oppose segwit.  I am just one.  Don't pretend that there is not an entire subreddit and a large percentage of community who oppose segwit.  If segwit actually had support from every one it would activate.  The opposite is true.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:44:26
What about the nodes that are signalling BU?  You used the word 'all'... Perhaps you meant SOME
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:43:02
Asicboost does not break the laws of physics.  Asicboost does not allow time travel.  I don't think it is as scary as it sounds.  
Every one can use asicboost if they really want to.  Every one can mine and run whichever implementation they want.  Every one can run a full node if they really want to.  
I think a higher block size is good for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:26:35
Great idea!  
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:35:08
REALLY?  How much will opening that channel cost?  Are you SURE 100% of this 1$ of bitcoin will reach the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:03:04
Efficient mining is not violence.  Why are you so upset that such a thing exists.  Code it out, that is fine.  We need to code out that pesky 1mb limit too.  
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:16:21
So.... Miners count suddenly?  Do they count or not?  Oh they only count if they agree WITH YOU.  FUN.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:41:22
Really Luke?  Zero benefit if you don't run a full node???  How about SOME benefit.  Surely there is SOME.  
Sigh, oh poor Luke.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:52:20
Personally, the worst part about segwit right now is that it does not solve the network congestion issue.  Raising the blocksize will solve this issue.  
A form of segwit could be created and tested at any point.  A blocksize increase needs to happen now.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:46:19
So much hostility?
No one ever promised that bitcoin would be 100% fair.  The solution works very well for many applications.  We should focus on USING the network instead of coding it towards a perceived sense of perfection that will never be reached. 
Perfectly fair mining is impossible and we should choose battles
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:29:24
Fees increase as people use the network.  5 years ago if someone talked about 1$ fees people would laugh at you.  2017 and we have 1$ fees!  
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:56:51
Except we CAN upgrade the network.  Perhaps the segwit upgrade has not been accepted but there are many upgrades out there that the community may be willing to accept.  
How about an upgrade that removes the blocksize 1mb limit.  I would guess that THIS UPGRADE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.  
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:27:42
Awesome, I wonder how much btc will reach you !  :) 
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:13:13
These are my original thoughts and you are calling it fud.  This particular idea isn't even scary or doubtful, if I was trying to scare . . .
My points are valid.  Scaling onchain will give every one more information of how the network actually behaves, and the information will be valuable.
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:34:16
What is a segwit
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:14:11
YES.  IT SOLVES MANY THINGS LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM.  THE TIME IS YESTERDAY.  
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:06:54
How do you know what the majority wants ?
I am not into the blaming game, I like to actually use technology that exists.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:31:05
Am I allowed to disagree with every thing in this post?  Because I do.  
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:13:11
I would like the opposite to happen.  I disagree with UASF as I am actually A USER that wants Bitcoin to scale ON CHAIN with out UASF but instead an upgrade.  
I will encourage people I know to stop running bip148.  
This is fun. . .
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:17:22
Well when Bitcoin reaches 170k I will have 100$, and the fee will be 150$.  Awesome!
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:08:31
My thoughts have been formed by studying Bitcoin since 2012.  
Bitcoin was released in 2009 with thousands of bugs.  It worked well enough to grow to where it is today.  
LN seems to have the opposite approach.  It will be in development for eternity and released when there are zero bugs (never)
I'm not trying to be hostile, but our views are sensible.  It is many independent thinkers, more clever than most.  Don't insult a large group of early loyal hardworking Bitcoin advocates/adopters/developers.
