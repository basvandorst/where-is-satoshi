Most Germans will not use Bitcoin because they are extremely risk averse with new technology. This is the country that still bans Uber and Google Maps because they are afraid of what might happen if they let new technology in. They are 10 years ahead on wind power, but 10 years behind on electric cars. When the EURO collapses, the smart Germans will probably buy some Bitcoin if they remember getting cheated when they converted from the Deutschmark to the EURO. But the average German will use CASH until their government bans it.

Gavin used to routinely insult other Core developers last summer when they would try to explain that 20MB blocks were a terrible idea. Telling them that they were "wasting his time with their ridiculous scenarios, stop being negative and get to work on actual solutions before it's too late". Usually he would be condescending or just plain ignore rebuttals from Core developers. They had to repeatedly ask him to keep things professional. Everyone knows now that 20MB blocks would have torn the network apart.

Lightning Network is an open source protocol with several different implementations. One of them is being spearheaded by Blockstream, but it's not even the most popular one. Anyone can contribute. It doesn't matter if the company is for-profit because the software is open source and they're building it to increase Bitcoin's utility.

I'm impressed with how you're able to criticise early investors for selling their coins, *as well as holding their coins*. They just can't win with you. If they choose to continue saving, then it means that nobody is spending because bitcoin has failed.

What is unfounded about it? He says that many people don't like the way Gavin is going about it (True), he thinks BIP 101 will never reach 75% (Probably True at only 0.47% now), and that it will speed up development for better solutions like BIP100 (True, garzik is working very hard on it right now). Downvoting BitNugget for that comment is a child move.

Regardless of what anyone thinks about Gavin, professing your unbridled love for him is embarrassing. Don't let your feelings for him blind you to the fact that he's also attacked and disrespected his fellow pioneers in the past. He's made great contributions, but he's neither innocent nor infallible. Treating him like a saint upon an altar is beyond ridiculous.

Interesting how these centralized wallet services like Circle and Coinbase want to increase the block size to 8 gigabytes so nobody can even host it from home and we all have to trust data centers. Mike likes to talk a lot about conflict of interest, but nobody talks about how these companies benefit from a bloated centralized block chain.

* In 14 years, VISA will dwarf its current transaction volume.
* Highly theoretical. No guarantee that bandwidth will increase at a predictable rate.
* SPV mining destroys network security by causing orphaned forks. It is a dangerous idea.
* How will they download a new gigablock every ten minutes, start hashing and propagate a smaller block before a centralized miner does?
* Something BitcoinXT was supposed to prevent, but didn't. Percentage-wise, more XT nodes crashed than Core nodes.
* Speculating about the price of bitcoin 10 years from now.
* Great. Use them.
* Centralized services that invade financial privacy, block transactions and patent bitcoin tech.
* The same man who caused Satoshi Nakamoto to abandon Bitcoin by visiting the CIA.
* As if other proposals can't be implemented.

Why would you want to store your coffee payment today for the next 20+ years? That's bloat and doesn't belong in the global ledger. Even at 8 gigabytes, Bitcoin still wouldn't be a global payment network.

You know I'm talking about the block size limit.
