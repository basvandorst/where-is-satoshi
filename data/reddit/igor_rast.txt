The wonders of bitcoin , Everybody sending some beer knows that Andreas himself will be getting the funds , without anyone in between. without exception (forget donate Haiti /Africa which never arrives).
Knowing he can continue with his passion for probably as long as he finds it interested  is probably a feeling he will be making multiple attemps to show gratitude to the community cause that is probably the most priceless gift he received for his work well done. Hope to keep seeing you for a long time pal.   You Rock

Well it kinda evolved out of being a currency too, and more into a store of value and being the backbone of this hole crypto space.  
all coins use to have only a btc trading pair (at start), times changed and we see more pairs like eth and ltc directly available to trade, even euro has allot more liquidity.
Indeed bitcoin is doing what internet did to the mailmen, watch closely :p

Well i have to say that Opstelten probably said that cause he has no clue what to do. Hes a old guy having a hard time understanding computers and internet itself. Knowing what SPAM is and how to combat it made it clear,he is clueless and follows advice . check it out 
Probably he doesnt want to get himself in a stupid position like with the pirate bay blocking thinking it will work
Bitcoin is here to stay

Cause the bank is sending non existing money from its own ledger to its own ledger. No wonder its free. 
Try sending to another bank /another country indeed like the others comment here

I get your point, its just sounds bad the ways its was stated, and id bet there are better ways to keep your moneys value rather than buying 10 cars. People still will need cars by the end of the day, peso , usd or btc , from A to B that's what matters.
But the hole discussion is off the topic , so your right , having wealth in a currency that can loose 20% or 44% like Venezuela did last , your in a F up position

The whole point of buying a car (in Argentina) is to protect your savings from inflationary. ??

Catch a boat to Curacao, sell some bolivars for usd , put that in a new account , and go back to Venezuela without any cash 
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:56:49
He Amir , What about ur F**king BTC , Al least give back the 50% some of that stash you have (cant find the link , someone help)
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:56:50
well , you do have to account for volume/liquidity @ the exhange the bitcoin payment gateway is using.
e.g. exchange A has 1 btc  usd , while another exchange B only has 0.5 btc selling  . so to fill a 1 btc order , it will take a higher price on payment processor B than A. the effects of market liquidity.
paying a bill in btc with the help of a bitcoin payment processor usually involves an instant market sell of btc to pay the amount in fiat

"Currently 85% of the mining power of bitcoin is signaling" 
Nodes != Miner.
Miner needs Node to participate, Node does not need miner to do the same
