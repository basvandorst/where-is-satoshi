But this data is actually free and can be taken from real exchanges. All order books are public, it's just the matter of collecting and doing analysis of the data. I see no benefit of someone using simulated exchange data to predict market moves.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:37:55
[Niffler.co]( simulated exchange allows people to practice cryptocurrency trading using fake money (play dollars). Each user gets 100k on signup. Once you generate some profit you can exchange that profit to sats over the lightning network. The funny part is that if you download BlueWallet or any other custodial LN wallet you don't need to worry about opening channels etc. you can get your sats straight away.

It does account for the exchange fees, but not taxes. Taxes vary from country to country, so there is no single rule that would fit all the users. If we see enough demand from specific country we will look forward to implement that or partner up with cryptocurrency accounting startups and see if we could have our simulated exchange integrated with them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:29:37
Because transaction data has to be added to the block-chain and for that reason blocks have to be mined. It's not difficult to confirm transactions, the issue here, is that 1 block is mined every 10 minutes and can only accomodate so much transactions.
edit: 1 bitcoin doesn't mean 1 block so once all bitcoins are mined miners will only benefit from transaction fees. This will allow them to keep finding new blocks.

I think it's on you to make sure you split the coins correctly. It does cost the company resources and money to deal with your mistakes. No one wants that. Not your keys, not your money.  
Also BSV and BCH are both scams and should not exist in the first place. I get that you want to cash them out, but for the future always keep your stuff on hardware wallet and do the splits before you have to move the coins.

the problem here that you are unlikely to enforce some countries that contribute to the most pollution, and while that is the case it would just cause more factory work to be outsourced to countries like China whichever country would do that would end up hurting their own economy to some extent.

I completely agree with your first point.   
And second point we comparing it for fun, just to track how bitcoin is doing. It's nice to see BTC MC to pass value of those  who are publicly sceptics of Bitcoin, like Jamie Dimon @ JPMorgan Chase, or W. Buffet with Berkshire Hathaway... Don't take it too seriously, it's just good indicator and small wins for Bitcoin.

The problem is that our community lack the effort to bring more people on board. I'm in love with what this startup is aiming todo,  They aim to create platform which will allow to teach newbies to trade without risking their money and give easy transition in.
I'm myself started learning about what bitcoin is only after I started trading it on exchange, as my motivation was to make money from it rather use it, but in the process I fell in love with Bitcoin and technology behind it and now I'm hodler with some trading experience that tries to get more people on board.
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:02:06
People need reason and motivation to learn and attempt to learn trading is part of that. I mentioned that before, but the way I learned about bitcoin was through trading attempt, as then you start reading to get all the information you need to make your trades when you get to the part where you learn about bitcoin itself. My point is that not many people will end up traders, but they learn more about what it is for sure. Remember that hodling is just long term trade position, if you hodling and expect to sell it later, then you are also trader in a way... just not frequent.

I'm wondering would it be possible to implement some sort of node reward? So whoever keep node running would get some benefits from doing so, similar how LN pays for routing transactions.

Oh, I'm not delusional by any means, and I would consider this if I wouldn't get  positive feedback outside of this community.

I think you confusing the meaning of contribution here.
It's pretty much as saying that miners doesn't contribute to network since they charge transaction fees...
The entire eco system is build on fact that it can create value in one way or another. Exchanges also get the benefits, but it creates the ecosystem in which bitcoin can function. 
Whatever new service is released with focus on bitcoin contributes to the ecosystem therefore what we do is definitely a contribution.

The best is not to track your portfolio if you not planning to sell anytime soon. Your portfolio value remains hypothetical unless you actually sell it.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:00:57
We need to get people interested in using bitcoin to improve adoption. One of the best ways to do so is by teaching people how to trade bitcoin. Yes, most of you might not disagree with me, but trading is actually really good motivation to learn more about the technology itself, because you keep reading all the news and following the market. This is how I learned about what bitcoin is, I started trading first and all knowledge I have about bitcoin at the moment came as consequence of trading. 
It didn't take long to understand that trading is not for me, but the knowledge I  gained about Bitcoin, allowed me to understand how powerful and disruptive it is.
I really love what  is trying to achieve with their startup in terms of allowing experienced traders to teach newbies on how trading works and get paid for doing so.
EDIT: 
In order to get Bitcoin adopted by the main stream, we need to get more people on board, once there will be more educated trades that do not follow FUD like crazy, we will see more stable market and that will make it more appealing for corporate world.
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:43:16
We not aiming to fuel speculative aspect of bitcoin. We want to give people initiative to learn more about crypto this way. HODLING is also trading, it’s just taking long term position. What exchanges do not teach, is what hazards exist in the space and how to protect your assets as well. We aim to get people curious, 95% of people got their first fraction of bitcoin on exchange. We want to give them some confidence before they go on exchange. The way I learned about bitcoin was through attempted trading, soon I understood that strategy that works best for me is taking longterm positions, but the knowledge I gained when trying to trade made me to fall in love with bitcoin. So you come in wanting to earn money and come out with knowing a lot more about what bitcoin is and how it works. People need motivation to learn and want to give it to them.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:44:34
Everyone that at moves a finger to help increase adoption in any way possible is worth applause.

It depends by what you measure it. 1 BTC will always be 1BTC. If we stop attaching it to fiat at some point, then this comparison will seize to exist. Obviously this won't happen in the near future.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:15:57
It's not. Because mean value is not guaranteed as time passes. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:07:47
The way we see it, is that we rather see people fail trading on our platform and understand that it's not as easy as they think than put real money into it. Alongside, we will teach them about all the hazard that exits in the space that actual exchanges never bother to do, so even if you decide to continue real trading, you will have much better knowledge of what you might expect.
P.S. Thanks for taking time to give feedback! Really appreciate it.

Are you talking about the case where BTC replace fiat completely? If not, then I think deflation is good, as seller can give better price than selling in fiat, as he could count on deflation if seller can afford the wait. From user perspective it you need something quick, you will buy it anyways. Like some people are patient and wait for sale to get the item they want, and some people can't bother.

The only one who is stupid is you...  Of course it's different class, but bitcoin is too young to be compared with gold or euro or usd.... Bitcoin first has to outgrow at least these companies and it's fun way to measure it's growth.

I think that it will naturally adjust itself to make sense. Maybe we will find a way to store more transactions in a block, which means that miner would be able to make more from adding those transactions in same block and make more money without increasing transaction fees. For e.g. now with 3k transactions in a block miners make 0.79022437 BTC.

I get ur point, but it's less fun to work with past values, many of use think what if I had done that or that.

How being desperate helps then? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:26
I strongly disagree that my example is poor. It would be stupid to assume that rich people getting richer based on solely this characteristic. But you can't deny that this doesn't help. I can tell from my own experience, that if you are desperate you are more likely to experience loss in one way or another. I own a company and very often I used to take any client and any job available to make sure I get enough money so company can survive through the month. Turned out that sometimes it's better to look for good client and do nothing for a month instead of being desperate and take anyone who pays money just to keep everyone busy. Trick here is that poor paid jobs are easy to get by, but when you get loads of these, you miss the opportunity to bring in clients who can afford pay better. This is just one example and I see clear correlation with being desperate and earning less.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:27:02
This is neat idea, but I would say it would be useful to show Fiat price in small print for reference. I think price is to volatile in order to be able to only tell price in crypto.

I did ask same dumb question, and people said it's safe, because we do have access to the seed.

Nice post, also for those who want to learn more before dipping their toes with real money, I recommend to do some trading on a [simulated cryptocurrency exchange](

You can invest recklessly on [ the difference is that it's simulated cryptocurrency exchange and you invest play dollars.

I made this tool for myself initially, as I find it useful to know how much market cap needs to increase in order for me to earn from trade and then I can judge how likely it is to happen.
