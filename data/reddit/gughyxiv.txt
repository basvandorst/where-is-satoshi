Well, that's right *today* not 8 years ago. How did you buy BTC without a CC when no ATM or local exchanges existed?
Do your parents let you manage thousands of dollars at your will if you are 14? Money you have in bank and can not touch at all?
Come on, let's be serious and talk about real world, not fairy tales.

Paypal is pure shit, both for customers and businesses.
As a customer I got 500$ stolen from a seller who did not ship me anything but the transaction was "not qualified for refund". Later, my company went bankrupt due to a lot of customers who repedetely asked for refunds after we provided the services they paid for. Those assholes are still waiting for me to pay them a huge amount of money I will never ever give them.

TL;DR: Buy a monkey and let it do crypto trading for you. /s

Yeah, sure, let's spend online more money than you have while you can not legally hold any form of digital currency.
No need to downvote, your reply is just dumb

Same in 2011, I was 15 and wanted to invest just 1k$. I tried every way to explain my parents how it could be extremely profitable if things were going right, but they didn't let me do it. Neither when the price climbed from 0,40$ to 35$ in 5 months: "It's a bubble" they kept saying... every time for 7 years.

I am of the same opinion of the OP, but I'm not really sure about the breaking of the cycle. Of course the time between this rise and the latest ATH is relatively short, but it reminds me of what happened back in 2013. Well, if that is the case, let's be prepared for a huge price increase

In 2011 i was 14yo and I **mined** 0.5 BTC with my HD6850: 0,5$ worth.  
Sold it in early 2013 for 150$. I tought it was an amazing deal, until the following autumn...
Feels bad thinking how naive I was back then...

Well, actually you can see the same bump on every BTC past ATH

And some analysts think now we could be in that phase

You can look at the current distribution here [ these are not actual people but address instead, which means that one persone may have multiple address but vice versa is unlikely.
This just states that 0.58% of the address contains 86.92% of BTCs in the world. Extending the range a little bit, the 95.55% of the BTCs is held by a small 2.85%.
