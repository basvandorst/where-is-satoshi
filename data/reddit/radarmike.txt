Should i trade all BCH for BTC now? Looks like BTC has future and i didnt know BCH is centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:31:30
Guys new bee here. Right now i have about 0.11 of bitcoin, 0.16 of bitcoin cash and 1.006 ether and 1 litecoin on coinbase wallet.
My plan is to hodl it for a long time. Do you think i will get returns on this  in future.? Is the future bright for cryptos? How high do u think BTC,BCH,ETH and LTC can go in a few years?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:25:26
There was no need for verification. I just signed up.have 2 btc withdrawal limit. If u want more then good to get verified. But rippple is 1.85 right now so i just needed to trade some of my ltc for it and other alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:01:49
I have tried many exchanges and i am very pleased with Binance . such painless process. Bought some XRPs and dash, zcash , I am a holder , have majority of crypto investment in Bitcoin mainly because its the boss. Also have eth, bch , but i liquidated LTCs to get XRPs .I dont care about the constant up and downs , i have invested what i can loose comfortably , but i do strongly believe in cryptocurrency tech , gone are the days when one had to be at the mercy of banks. I love technology. through its all ups and downs , it will emerge and the mainstream cannot help but change themselves to match it ,integrate it. Now it seems like they not only not understand it , they are afraid of the ease of transaction crypto provides for everyone no just the 1%. They cannot stop it no matter how much they try , evolution wont wait for them and go forward with or without them ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:54:46
This is new to me .Will moving to a personal wallet help?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:51:25
I kept my investment in bitcoin untouched ,infact moved it to electrum. And i took some ltc and  sent freely from gdax to binance and traded it for  ripple, monero, ,dash. I have eth and bch as well. But good percentage is in bitcoin.  Tomorrow i have to learn how to create private wallet for ripple, monero and dash. I got my trezor today btw. After going through many exchanges ,i am loving both gdax and binance. I will hodl bitcoin through al its fluctuations , but whats going on with LTC , why did its founder sell all his ltc   i wonder?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:37:29
Why? BCH has no future? or is it because of the dislike for the currency itself?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:07:28
 if you get swayed by the ups and downs then you suffer. If you stand knowing you are fine, ups and downs are temporary and if you know the technology is sound then you ride the wave and keep your peace of mind and not drown in it or suffer mentally , emotionally with every up and down. go spend time away from watching the screen if it bothers you , spend time in nature. Let it be. Trust the technology
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:20:51
Because some part of me trusts in crypto future and loves this technology and i can forget about what i invested even if i face the loss but i doubt i would incur loss and I  value opinions and confirmations  of the pros here ;) . Remember you all were new bees at some point and learnt from someone else . btw this whole reddit thing is new to me as well. I used to be a passive observer of reddit discussions for a long time and now i am participating in it. Why do i need to wait a whole 10 minutes before posting a reply ? Lol. Long wait. Hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:30:55
Got my trezor set up and transfered eth to it from gdax . Have fraction of btc sitting in electrum ( didnt want to pay fee to move it to trezor and will transfer more btc  from coinbase - gdax  to trezor when my bank deposit clears . I see trezor supports dash and zcash ,i have little investment there which can be left on exchange no problem,for now. Now i am just waiting for bank purchase of btc to hit coinbase . So slow. :/ a whole week or more .
Now i need to learn about private wallets that holdriple, monero iota etc. Will individual paper wallet do for each one of these?  And also how to i check a paper wallet balane? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:22:30
I bought 2000$ worth of BTC and 600$ BCH  , 745$ ETH, 325$ worth of LTC.  I am not expecting any returns soon . Just ordered trazor. And i am gonna put it all in there forget about it for a while and watch the market. Do you think i am very late to the game or am i on the right track? as i have heard crypto is the future. Btw i knew i can loose what i hav invested but my portfolio has other investments and this is the limit i was comfortable with that i wanted to put in cryptos to experiment with. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:18
Guys i was so tired of kraken taking its time to verify so i exchanged fraction of my LTC for ripple, monero, iota,dash  ,zcash on binance. Binance is pretty easy to sign up for and trade. All i did was deposited some LTC into gdax through my coinbase wallet and themn sent to binance fee free. Then converted it to BTC and bought ripple ,monero, dash and zcash, iota. Majority of my crypto investment is in BTC safely put in electrum.i also am not touching ETH investment as well. Felt good to diversify :) so yeah if you want to trade some eth or ltc for ripple head to binance.
Btw i got my trezor yesterday to which i will be moving my btc,bch ,eth and ltc ( ltc at this point is small investment) o dont know why the founder guy sold all his . So much to learn now about making paper wallets for alts.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:35:37
Thanks for your perspective. But for me i had to clear the thought from my head by sharing and asking if i was doing right thing or was i fool to just invest that much ? I am sharing my inner questions here in trusting that you all like me has that part of you in you that wants help another genuinely and i was right. I value each reply i have received , each support i felt from here  
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:10:54
Because most here are pros in bitcoin investing and kind of good at predicting a probable future ,and i dont want to listen to mainstream media, rather learn from here. I am sure tou must have asked at some point in your life opinion of others about the future of something that mattered to you. Its only human to ask for opinions , advices from someone you trust and realize that choice is always yours alone ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:30:50
Thank you for your opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:59:49
Yeah i was checking amazon for trazor or ledger. Is this electrum a desktop only software wallet ? and  is it safe?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:24:37
This is what i did. i downloaded electrum wallet and set it up on my computer. disconnect wifi and write down seed words etc.
signed up GDAX.com using the same coinbase login since they both are the same company and then sent from coinbase to gdax trade account my BTC for free, there is no fee here. and then from gdax i sent BTC to electrum wallet receive address for free. gdax pays the fee. so basically you can move your btc for free from coinbase to gdax to electrum .
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:33:47
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:33:53
Awesome thanks guys!. So monero, dash and ripple? In smaller amounts? Also, what kind of fees i am looking at for moving my investments to trazor from coinbase or is there a better way?. Right now everything in coinbase. I do have a gdax account but havent used it. I created it recently since its the same login as coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:44:49
I hear you . And i also see that there had to be some amount of trust between people for this new technology to have come this far as a massive network ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:48:23
just now my second transaction was confirmed as well. YAY to fee free transaction from GDAX. it ate up fees. Now i have my bitcoin secure in electrum wallet, just wanted to be ready incase , if at all any hard fork happens. although i am getting trezor soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:24:34
Just moved my BTC from coinbase to GDAX and then to electrum wallet. One transaction shows as confirmed and the other shows as unconfirmed and the balance shows the full amount including confirmed and unconfirmed in mbtc. IF the rumor of fork is true and happens tomorrow , will i get the bonus coins for both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions or just for the confirmed? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:00:49
Do you think bitcoin.com's personal wallet instructions are good place to start ? I am glad that i am already learning something new from here :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:27:33
Within 5 minutes for me
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:52:26
wrong. unfortunately. today it is at 14200
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:21:51
Phew thats good know. I just transferred from my coinbase to GDAX and then electrum. the fees were outrageous and i am happy i am not paying them. BTW electurm now shows on confirmed transaciton and one unconfirmed. If the rumor of fork is true , then should i receive bonus coins for even the unconfirmed transaction? or just the confirmed transaction. anyways. it fees great to just move money away from coinbase.lol i love gdax though. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:15:19
what will be the low?. Because i so want to buy now. But dont want to miss the new low. will it go 6k again before bouncing back up or will it hover around 8k? I am ready to click the buy button but holding myself back lol!
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:17:36
Its better to not to tell anyone. enjoy the secret pleasure of investing in crypto. that way you dont have explain anything to creatures that dont live in this reality

when does it settle?
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:55:52
Btw who else can be humans but humans?!. Sometimes its good look at ourselves objectively ,neutrally then perhaps we can appreciate the little things that only human can do or be and understand why we do certain things which arent in our best interest and learn to look at it differently perhaps. Every action has a motivation behind which there is an innocent belief that such action being in our best interest against all other choices.Otherwise no one would do what they do.

As per BInance twitter Only of the users who had API set up with bots it seems. Looks Bots are doing their own thing. Here is what i read from some one who retweeted this-
Binance: We are investigating reports of some users having issues with their funds. Our team is aware and investigating . The only confirmed victims have registered API keys (to use with trading bots or otherwise). There is no evidence of the Binance platform being compromised.

perhaps Op (of the sunrise comment) expressed their 'trust' that bitcoin will go up based on their past observations of ups and downs of the market , using a metaphor? its a simple metaphor.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:11:31
so though it appears you tell others who they are ,infact all you are really doing is telling everyone who you Are in your own eyes. lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:33:23
hahah same here. i watched 9.4k hoping i will go down but it didnt instead was hovering around 9.7 and 9.8 , bought at 9.8 k

@_date: 2018-03-18 19:10:13
Man , another thing you need to pay attention in your mind is -'context', with what context something is said depends on your ability to understand the context or not. That way you can use very few words and understand many things multidimensionally .Please, i dont have time to break it all down for you. Either you get it or you dont. If your interpretation of what the guy said is so far OFF then no one can make you get it . You just dont see it the way i did. When one makes a comment like 'what goes up , comes down or what goes down comes up' and you just immdiately compare it to a stone sinking under the lake , then you miss the point. You will make a terrible poet. for example if you were to read a poem from some one who wrote , 'her presence as bright as the sun light or her love as soft  as the moon beam'  and if you will go nuts with the 'physics' of how this is 'inaccurate' since  SUN is made of helium and how human flesh is made of different elements ' etc then man, poetic writing and metaphors are not for you.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:34:36
yeah watched 9.4k pass in conflict . bought at 9.8k
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:43:34
hehe. the thing , no one, including yourself can be all that you said  coz every human is a tough and awesome soul to even exist in this reality where living isnt  easy but we continue everyday with fresh hopes and dreams and creativity against many odds.Day trading is an adventure unto itself ! lol loss or win , one can have the thrill for sure. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:44:00
man , you just dont understand simple  metaphors , do you? My interpretation of what the guy meant was much more simple than yours.when he compared sun rise and sun set cycle he was talking about the self evident nature of truth of what goes down , usually comes up. Its not the 'number' of times sun sets or rises vs 'number' of times bitcoin crashed BUT the philosophical understanding that its a natural cycle  of 'change'. Jesus man , dig little deep.

They can try but cannot suppress tech evolution. lets see what happens
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:25:48
If you are worried and being affected mentally about your crypto investnents to the point of pulling it out then you cannot afford to lose it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:16:17
This is why they say invest what you can afford to loose and forget about it. That way when it goes down, it goes down and no pressure to pull the money out but only curiosity as to what future will bring 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:28:39
They may have to buy usd or other internarional currency and through international services (if any) buy crypto. If the tech evolution is real, nothing can suppress it
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:30:24
If you want to wait and see for long term , invest only that you are comfortable leaving in a bear market and  the loss of which doesnt affect you. But if it affects  you ,then sell for your own peace of mind. good luck.
