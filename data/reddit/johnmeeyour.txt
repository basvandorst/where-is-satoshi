Me 3. Just bought my 2100th coin. 1 % of the 1% baby!

When the period comes, the thought ends. Until then, this thought just keeps floating in the ether. Running on through time due to being lite and punctuationally free. Caching itself to nothing. Just a ripple in time.

Convert to, pump, and dump each of the top 300 sh*tcoins successively. Then buy gold.

As someone who just saw the non-parody version yesterday for the first time, this was mildly funny and moderately witty. Thanks for the share. ��

I was kinda the same way.  First read about it 2007, even installed Coinbase on my Palm Treo 650 at the time, but never linked my bank account.  I tried mining in late 2009 but at that time I earned only $3, something like 3000BTC IIRC.

To be real, crypto in general is - or will eventually be - a direct threat to the central banking system. To think that the Fed and other CBs will just ignore crypto is quite naive. The Fed is the most powerful and influential institution ever devised (change my mind?).  Think back to 2008-2009. The Fed printed +- 1 trillion USD for the ‘bailout’ that ‘saved’ the word. This is several times the whole crypto market cap. 
The Fed and other CBs will probably Lobby to ban crypto. Impossible? Imagine if suddenly all major exchanges are frozen. You cannot withdraw or deposit to exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.  ‘Your’ wallet is also frozen.  Owning crypto is suddenly as illegal as owning counterfeit currency, for those who have hardware/offline/paper wallets. What happens to BTC then?  At best, it implodes, but continues to be exist nominally.  Prison time for owning crypto... yikes. 
Make no mistake, if the USD starts losing relative value and the central banking system ‘crashes’, it’s not going to mean BTC skyrockets. BTC is a novelty to the Fed. When/if ever it becomes a threat instead, it’s game over in a big way  
This isn’t pessimism, this is just reality. I say all this in hope that it doesn’t happen this way. I would hope that BTC come completely replaces USD one day - honestly - but one has to be realistic, too.

You actually have it exactly backward. Unless you have an adjustable rate mortgage, it’s ‘easier’ to pay a mortgage over time with inflation. The principal on your mortgage doesn’t change, and the interest rate doesn’t either. Think about it: would you rather have $300,000 now, or $300,000 in 2050?  It’d be way easier to pay the $300,000 in 2050 due to inflation. Your salary might be $75,000 now, but with inflation, it could be $165,000 in 2050. Thus, the money you earn today has less ‘value’ to pay off a mortgage than it does as time goes on.

 Noob question: it seems like the halving news is much stronger this tome versus the last one. If bitcoin is overbought in anticipation of the halving, isn’t there a good chance that the assumed ‘ride’ of 2021-22 be rather small?

I will have to say, when it crashes to at least $9250 euros, I will sell AT LEAST 33% of my 17 original BTC from the early days. HODL the rest for mining.

Only if you ignore mining costs, which is nonsensical. It’s profitable to mine on the moon as well, if you ignore the costs to get there and back ��

Low bitcoin price, low minor rewards. Relatively.

I didn't say that , or mean to imply it.  The central banking system includes....all...central banks.  ECB, the Fed, Deutsche Bank, Central Bank of Brazil.  The Fed just happens to be the most powerful and ostensibly the most influential, given the the US dollar is the world's reserve currency.  Thus, while it is very true that crypto is very much decentralized and worldwide, it is still subject law wherever it is used/mined/etc.  
Many drugs are illegal in almost every country; crypto can be illegal in almost every country, too.  Especially if a world financial crisis happens, and "emergency measures" mean banning it, for whatever reason they can come up with.
Conspiracy-esque? Sure, but that's sort of the point of this thread - unlikely outcomes.
What if central banks already own the bulk of BTC?  What if Satoshi's 1M BTC are in CB control already?  Just a thought, nothing more.

I like this reply, especially the nuance part about 5% down, then 5% up not being equal ($100–&gt;$95–&gt;$99.75) 
However, regarding the 1% per day not being realistic, with cryptocurrency being in its infancy I think it should be reconsidered - mainly because all of the main coins have only trended up on average.  Basically, over the last 5 years, BTC/LTC/ETH have had far more + % days than - %.   This is different than stock trading with something like MSFT, GE that are so well established that it’s extremely difficult to predict daily movement.   Of course, with crypto, eventually this will be the case too, but over the last couple years if you sold your trading stack of BTC every time it increased 5% and bought every time it decreases 3-5% you’d be on your way.  Or you can just HODL, but compound interest is wonderful when starting with small principal.

Not really.  Lending rates and deposit rates have always been vastly different, with lending rates being much higher than deposit rates.
