Exactly what I was looking for, thank you

How easy will LN be to use? As a relative newbie, I have confidence in my ability to google shit and follow directions, but what about casual users who have an app wallet and buy from coinbase? If LN is meant to make day to day transactions a reality, how accessible will it be to the average user (and future “average” user)?
I guess wallets will start integrating it?
I ask this because I explained segwit to a friend who started buying in November and he was totally uninterested in the work it involved. Which is fair imo, if you expect something easier will come along or a knowledgeable friend can help you should you choose to stop hodling everything

Transaction fees and miner fees are different. Coinbase charges a % transaction fee to exchange your fiat for btc, but to *move* that btc to a new address you must pay miner fees to confirm and process the transfer.
Exchanges have no (direct) control over miner fees. All they can do is give you the option to choose how much you’re willing to pay to get it done faster. Or support segwit. 
And yes miner fees have increased a lot lately due to increase in transactions

I tell people I don’t have any, I used it to pay off my student loan when it was in the news for being $10k. Which is only half a lie

Tfw you only just realize that Gemini was created by the winklevoss twins and they didn’t just randomly have btc holdings...

You only lose it all if you sell near 0 :) the 2014 slow decay was a scary time for those looking to sell that year, but a great time to buy and hold for those who intended to wait regardless.

If you already bought on coinbase (like I did when I saw they accept Canadian credit cards), you can transfer funds from your Coinbase wallet to your QuadrigaCX wallet. I’d just buy from QuadrigaCX in general though to save on transfer fees

I mean, it just means they bought 5x as much as they had. That’s not hard, it just requires funds. They quintupled their holdings, not their gains

That’s what I do. I browse news occasionally but don’t presume to know enough to time my purchases. I just buy a small amount with my first paycheque of the month, along with putting some money in a standard investment account, and a short term savings account. 
It’s just an emotionless part of my monthly saving. Like with most investments, if you intend to hold it for a long time then the precise timing of your buys matters little. Which is good, since humans are demonstrably bad at timing markets.

You could always go with a wallet where you at least possess your keys, like a trusted mobile or desktop app. Or create a paper wallet. I agree that a $100 hardware wallet hardly makes sense when you only have a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin, you might feel differently if you keep buying more in the future. 
I don't transfer immediately, maybe once every month or 2, but I'm not dealing with a lot of btc. I just happen to buy 2x a month, the days my paycheque arrives. It's whatever you're comfortable with. You will incur more transaction fees if you buy and transfer frequently, and I'm personally comfortable with letting my smaller amounts sit in coinbase until I feel the transaction fee isn't too much for what I'm withdrawing to my wallet. Others may not be comfortable with that.

I felt the same way when it was at $7,700 last week, but look where we are now. By next week you may be hoping it “dips” to $8,500 again

Gdax is coinbase’s exchange that facilitates trades between users, rather than buying or selling directly with coinbase. It’s harder to use for newbies and requires a little bit of knowledge about making/taking orders, understanding the order book etc. The fees are lower as a result.

It’s a show about nerds (but not written *for* nerds) and how alien women are, with lowest-common-denominator punchlines. It’s less than mediocre, but what has probably made it so hated is how popular it has been for years

Your experience of the drug is still subjective though, provided it isn't like, laced with something unexpected. Most medicines are for exacting a specific effect or cure on the body, which is different. I could say "oh this MDMA wasn't very good, I didn't roll very hard but I was very cuddly, 2 stars". But how is someone going to know if their antibiotics worked all the way? They're totally fucked if it didn't! That antibiotic is ruined for them. There's a reason these drugs are prescription, and the people able to give out these prescriptions are very much *not* anonymous. Wide mis-prescription of anti-biotics, anti-psychotics, stimulants etc would be really bad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your proposed model here? This is also beside the fact that while the drug markets are *economically* functional, actual people get ruined by mis-dosing or just using rec drugs all the time.
edit: you may be interested to know that in Canada there's an app/website called Medeo that allows you to connect to a doctor on your ipad, phone whatever and video conference or text. they can send you doctor's notes or prescriptions or referrals, besides the usual medical advice. the doctors are not anonymous in any sense and it's free because of the way Canada's health care works. I might have had less initial empathy for your idea because my doctor visits are free and my medication has a 10% co-pay with my free insurance. but this app presents a similar online situation to the one you are describing, I think.
