So proof of concept is in the price? Bitcoin is an all-or-nothing technology, and it is far away from both even after an 88% drop. Your call.
 Cryptocurrency is a joke if its expected to hover anywhere between $200 and $20,000 over the next ten years. That would still be an undefined market for bitcoin.
What's it gonna be?

This just in: the planned number has increased to 850,000 ATM's in Greece. There's a partnership between BitNodeChainBlockBit and CoinBitBlockBitBitChainwallet to make it happen.

Doesn't matter what their motivation is; bitcoin needs to be invincible to this stuff. The sooner they try to break it, the better. Good on em. Do your best to kill the virtually non-existant bitcoin-dependent businesses while there is room to do it.

Thank you. You don't have to dig too deep to see that this "store of value" bullshit for any asset is just speculation and subjectivity, which in itself is not meaningless, but it shouldn't be portrayed as something as concrete as a "store".

A house has little utility if there is no one around to make it useful.  You can spend millions building a house in the middle of the desert that will be valued at salvage cost after it's done.  In a healthy market, you might get away with recouping your costs and then some profit on top of that, but it's still speculation on whether you're building into a healthy market.  There is no such thing as "store of value"; you can go on historical prices in an asset class to determine how safe it might be from volatility, but absolutely nothing is a store of value, much less bitcoin (which will never be a store of value no matter how much the price increases).

Right? Your workforce shrinking, never having turned a profit, and a large percentage of your liquid assets being stolen hardly means you're failing. Your valuation should actually be worth 10x in the face of these.

@_date: 2015-09-20 14:13:32
But they have no clue what the "right" way is. I keep hearing this stupid argument.
What's really at play are their notorious unbridled developer egos. Mark my words: these bitcoin core assholes will start fighting amongst themselves once it's clear they've won the XT fight. As a group, the Core developers will never release another implementation again.  If they don't have consensus on a solution within themselves now, what makes you think they ever will?
 Anyone supporting that group of bitches is just as responsible for bitcoin's demise.

Could you imagine being able to move money from fiat to bitcoin as easily as you move cash from checking to savings? 
I envision very soon online banking having a savings, checking, and bitcoin line, with the ability to move funds between each seamlessly.
Sure there's a bit of reserve banking going on there, but it will definitely increase the demand for bitcoin in a non-zero amount. 
If Barclays fully commits to this, they should have no problem managing this very effectively.
Let's get behind this because if the last 5 years has taught us anything it's that virtually no one is going to dump their checking accounts for full bitcoin dependency.  This is the natural transition. Don't listen to the loony all-or-nothing libertarians around here; this is how bitcoin goes mainstream.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:46:01
Where's the demand for that? Don't be too full of yourself, that's a shit idea.  The general population will never know if .00001 btc to remove a paywall is a good deal or not.  They cannot make value calculations or keep score of exchange rates to even begin thinking about surfing an ad-free internet that's been replaced with micropayments.  Never going to happen.
The bitcoin community is still 10 years away from creating anything close to Venmo, which fucking rocks.  I'm back on the State's side just because of how awesome that app is and how shitty and scammy the bitcoin community is.   
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:23:36
an "off-chain" transaction isn't a true bitcoin transaction, now is it? It's just standard bookkeeping by some dudes.  The transactions being shown in the chart are real transactions, so it doesnt matter what is going on off-chain - on-chain is growing and will continue to grow.

To the people wondering if the balance is in bitcoin, fiat, horse manure, etc, look: who gives a shit? Keep your bitcoin in cold storage and when youd like to spend some of it easily, shift it to coinbases card. That's what this is about.

And even if they were aware of the Yen/dollar exchange rate, they probably are not in-tune to their central banking's inflation policy, import/export ratios, their treasury's holdings of foreign currencies, foreign investment among many other factors. All of these things effect the Yen/Dollar exchange rate.  So if you see "stability" in forex terms, you're getting about 10% of the picture.  Your country has stabilized exchange ratios at the cost of massive taxation, debt increases, etc. on either side.  
Since it's detached from all governments, Bitcoin will reflect every single volatility factor in the exchange rate it's being measured against.  This will always be the case until (if) it becomes the global reserve currency.  Welcome to a new paradigm. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 23:22:22
What I want to know is how many bitcoin addresses have a balance?
That would at least put a ceiling on how many people own bitcoin.

If bitcoin solves a problem or increases quality of life/leisure time, it'll sell itself. Disguising it as a branded product makes a lot of people very skeptical or just plain ignore it.

Again, if bitcoin is the miracle we claim it to be, it should sell itself. By billboarding it, it looks more like a pay-to-play app going up against a free-to-play venmo or PayPal. 
Emerging markets can benefit from bitcoin? Apparently not today. Remittances can be taken over by bitcoin? That's not it either. Bitcoin is safer than most currency inflation? Fuck off, cuz that ain't true. I know: let's market the hell out of it and see if we get rich.

At the top 10 exchanges (98% of all trading activity), just under 1.8 million bitcoin were traded in the last 24 hours. So about 12% of bitcoin's market cap was traded in just one day - I don't know if that is thin or not, but I have a hunch that it isn't.
