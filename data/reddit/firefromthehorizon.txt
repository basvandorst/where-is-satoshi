I always ask if BTC is a payment option before buying from anywhere. Send Merchnow a email or phone call and lets get them to accept!
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:21:47
No, this is the pay screen for bitpay.

First of all thanks for the bookmarking! It means a lot to us here at Illcrew!  So far the process of setting up Bitcoin has been MUCH easier than the credit card process. We are trying hook up all the other alt coin currencies (doge, litecoin, etc...) We really hope that you do purchase a hoodie in the near future! Thank you for the support!

My feels?! Oh man...my feels are...feely....
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:13:14
I definitely support this
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:15:48
Why must this be a huge debate? Lol you either buy it yourself and see how it effects you (which I am doing) or don't buy it and suck it up. -_-
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:20:07
But wouldn't you need the secret key to actually access the BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:14:15
I want it!
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:27:27
Buy me a raspberry pi and ill set it up ;\)

The ability to connect accounts like coinbase would make it a hell of a lot easier.

2007 Buick Lucerne. I was running on my gas light. Usually I'll only put in $30 and it will last me two weeks give or take how active I decide to be lol.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:43:32
Hmm...it still seems to be crashing. It happens when I attempted to go to my recents. I also still can't uninstall it for some reason and the systemui crash issue stays ~~until I restart my phone~~.

Your site says that you have a OpenBazaar store but I cant seem to find it :(
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:54:29
$40 in gas or $40 in Bitcoin? Looks like I walking.
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:58:56
Probably should have added more details! Here you go:)
Google Pixel XL (Verizon)
Android version: 8.0
Nova Launcher
Sorry for poor format and any poor grammar. Im currently on my phone. 
It hasn't happened to any other applications, I've tested going to the "app info" section on both system and non-system apps and it works fine. I am able to uninstall any other application also. When I open the app, I am unable to use my home button and recents button. The crash doesn't happen until I attempt to swipe the app in my recents to go to my home screen. After that it's just constantly crashes until I uninstall. When I attempted to uninstall it via "app info" it will crash before even seeing the page. When I attempt to uninstall it via Nova Launcher app drawer it will crash the package installer.
I'm going to reinstall it and if there are any new  issues I'll update.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:57:29
Love the new UI! Unfortunately, I still seem to have issues still with going to my recents while I am in the app :(
Anyone else with a Pixel who can confirm the issue still stands in v5 update?
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:37:07
Sorry for all the issues I am having! Lol but Im not seeing the v5 update 
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:35:55
The app crashes my systemui. When I try to uninstall it, it crashes my package installer. Still enjoy the app and found places I didn't even know accepted Bitcoin though lol
Edit: Only way to uninstall is by going to Play store. (Google Pixel XL) 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:16:52
Makes me wonder how many other users haven't opened that port.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:06:59
Still having the same issue with the SystemUI crashing after pressing the recents button, and my home button doesn't work. Other than that, my back button works and  I can navigate the app perfectly!
Edit: crashes the package installer, and appinfo as well so I am unable to uninstall it see application info. I should add that once the app is installed, these issues are not just when in the app but occur everywhere until it is uninstalled
