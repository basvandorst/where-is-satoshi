That's the exact reason I only use Coinbase now and I'm very happy that their instant buy is out of beta now. 3.75% doesn't really bother me $60 cap limit doesn't bother me.  Heck, I'm just a poker player anyways.  I also use Blockchain Wallet to send funds from Coinbase. So like circle did they won't kick me off for gambling.  That's why I think I got kicked off at least.  I made it too easy for them to see where my  funds were going. Having two wallets fixes that problem I figured out.

I am very active in the chat on the daily and have befriended a few mods there. I have never heard one complaint of coins being stolen or going missing. I've been playing there for over a year. Their support is 24/7 and great!

That  probably covers gambling in my case explained above. ��

Have you even read there terms and conditions. They will not shut you down for that.

Ok ok if you're trading daily then MAYBE.. But if you buy low and sell high even once a week you will be fine. They aren't that harsh.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:27:01

I'm guessing you bought when it was idk around 379? Lol but yeah I trade through Coinbase and unless you use a credit card you'll wait 5 even 7 days. But know this. Once the money is in your Coinbase account you can buy and sell through your btc and usd wallet instantly.

Anyone received their card yet? I'm in CA. So I'm worried that 1,000 cards have already been given out for the beta test. Not sure if worth signing up right now.

Americas Cardroom is great but what's the deposit fee like? Withdrawal fee?
