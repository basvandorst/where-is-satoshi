Yes, we should all bow down each day and give thanks the God of State for our privilege (not natural rights) to be alive and for all the wonderful things the State built with our stolen labor. We shouldn't complain or try to make things better because that would make us look uppity and ungrateful. This is slave training 101. What's that make you, the slave who whips the others for getting out of line?

Why do you have to resort to insults? State worship is a thing you know and name-calling those blasphemous of those beliefs is usually a dead give away of this infliction.
And, yes, bitcoin (cryptocurrency) is better, more efficient money than government money.  That will be proven.

Look, bitcoin showed us all that we DON'T need Gov't to provide money. Do you know how big that really is? What that really means for all other less complicated functions of Gov't?

These BTC were found on Ross Ulbricht's personal computer, not on some Silk Road server. 
That means they belong to him until he is proven guilty and his trial hasn't even began. You just bought stolen bitcoins.
By bidding, you support civil forfeiture without due process. AKA mafia thievery.  Good luck with your karma.

Nothing wrong with sponsored content as long as it's disclosed to be sponsored.  It's not much different than a banner ad in that way.

Obviously, the gov't couldn't be replaced overnight. Society could organize in a much better way than current government if they were free to do so. BTW - Anarchy literally means "without rulers" or "anti-rulers", not without "rules".
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:51:38
I'm not sure what service government serves anymore.  Seems like they just funnel our money into pockets of the rich or into a worthless ditch like war.  What little peaceful services they do provide society can likely be handled in a MUCH more efficient way and without the need for mandates enforced with the threat of violence.

Why is everyone a freaking rape suspect? If you think this way, I feel VERY sorry for you.

I just don't think government is the most efficient way to provide most services anymore.  And monopolies generally aren't good even if they're state-run monopolies.

LOL - Are you saying gov't provides clean drinking water efficiently?  That it can't be figured out without government? And you're holding public schools up as a success? You think that cancer treatment has anything to do with the government besides only funding research of ineffective Meds?
You do realize there is more than one way to solve problems and provide services, right?

Patriotism is another infliction difficult to shed.  I've been living out of the US for 7 years until recently. Let's not play who's worse and stick to the principle of finding new ways to solve problems that gov't make worse.  How could you be against that?

Robin Hood stole from the State and returned the taxes to the people. He didn't steal from private people to help the State wage war.

And when he proves that he's Satoshi you're going to look like a retarded hater.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:11:45
So? Assuming that's all true. His company was failing. Who cares? What does that prove? He has IP assets he can monetize. Who wouldn't sell assets to save their company? You think someone with $25M to spend on IP assets is stupid? That they don't do their due diligence? 
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:45:03
Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen are two more of the smartest bitcoin people from the beginning. You think they're so easily fooled? That would make Wright an EPIC scammer. Almost to be respected. To fool two of the best minds in Bitcoin. Themselves decent judges of character, presumably. You can hardly advance that far without being so. They somehow were tricked by him? I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:10:47
I'm not trolling. I believe he's Satoshi and will eventually prove it and lots of people will be exposed for being incredibly disrespectful to the inventor of Bitcoin. I have no proof. But I've been following bitcoin since 2010. In those early days, Wright was a humble gentleman scholar hanging around the scene. He didn't strike me as a scammer or someone who wanted attention. When he "came out" as Satoshi, he appeared under tremendous pressure and very reluctant to reveal himself. People call him a scammer for evading taxes? Satoshi gets extra points from me for that.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:05:13
Yes. That's how adults protect assets. Read a book.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:50:53
What makes more sense? That CW ran a genuis scam that fooled very smart people or that he's one of the inventors of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:52:47
If he had collaborators, it only makes sense to put them in trust. It's the most responsible way to handle it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:54:14
No one should be coerced to pay taxes. That doesn't make him a scammer or a criminal.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:31:27
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:20:05
Additionally, you may not like or agree with Roger Ver, but he is not stupid or a bad judge of character. I'm willing to bet that Ver has confirmed that Wright is genuine before investing in his work....
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:11:37
Then go create garbage and try to sell it to VC's if it's so easy.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:26:15
He'd have to be a genuis if we're to believe the scam story.

You can bet that if I was spending $25M to acquire Intellectual Property, a team of people would be digging through his work for six months to determine the authenticity of the design and confirm hard proof of when the design was created.

I believe Craig Wright is Satoshi. Your bizarre over-the-top vitriol toward him only confirms it in my mind. One day he'll prove it and you haters will still be losers.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:31:35
What abhorrent morals has CW displayed if indeed he's been telling the truth all along?
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:07:46
He was smart enough to pay no taxes and receive millions in "tax credits" and manage to stay out of jail? LOL! I doubt any of that is actually true.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:38:01
"possible". Gavin is uber smart. The people in this thread aren't.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:57:18
I don't care one way or another. Makes no difference. But I can understand why "Satoshi" would run back to his cave to hide from monsters like in this thread. Plus, he'd also have bigger monsters to slay like the Australian govt which oddly raided his home over taxes? Like that's normal.  Better for him to pretend the hoax claimers were right all along.
