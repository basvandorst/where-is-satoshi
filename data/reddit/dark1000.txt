Countries and firms do. Since when is a hedge not an investment?

I wouldn't disagree. If they don't see value in it, their demand for it will drop and the price will drop. But "the masses" aren't and will not be the only ones involved from here on out. Institutional investors will join in the market, and that will provide some level of inertia against panics in either direction.

That is a very poor understanding of stocks. If one person trades a share in a firm to another person, that has no material affect on the company. No revenue is transferred to the firm. It gains absolutely nothing from the transfer. The ownership share already existed. It's initial creation generated revenue. But all subsequent movement is entirely independent of that.
Assets generate revenue for a firm. But a transfer in share ownership does not generate or support an asset in any material way.
You are talking about ownership vs a transfer of ownership, which are two very different things.

That's not really true. Liquidity has increased, new currencies have been proposed and released with different use cases and technical designs, infrastructure such as exchanges have been created, partnerships have been inked, etc.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin, which is clearly not a currency at this point.
A hedge is a form of investment, ergo they are investing in currency. It's pretty cut and dry. On top of that, there are trading instruments you can buy or sell that represent currencies.
To say that currency cannot be an investment is factually wrong.

That's how we define the "correct price" of anything in a market. It is where supply meets demand.

That's simply not true. If you buy a stock directly from the company in an IPO, that money is put to use generating revenue (hopefully). The vast, vast majority of trades have nothing to do with that and generate no value for the company. Nothing is created or made.

Fiat currency is both. Have you never heard of Forex trading?

Money in and of itself is worthless. It is what you can use it for that gives it purpose.

Not all stocks will be available to you, but it's easy to buy funds and stocks through Charles Stanley or Hargreaves Lansdown. Obviously fees vary, but it's not a difficult process.

It doesn't matter what the fees are now. It matters what the fees are when there's a huge volume and the number of transactions increases exponentially, which is what would happen with real adoption.

Blockchain (not currencies) is being implemented in a lot of industries. Implementation takes time.
