I can see where they're coming from and they're probably right - centralised bitcoin will help increase adoption.
What they don't realise is bitcoin will always remain decentralised and that's non negotiable.
I'd rather wait 10 years for a decentralised Lightning Newtork than 5 years for a bunch of uni nerds controlling bitcoin with nefarious agendas.

Actually bitcoin is quite inconvenient at the moment. Transactions are slow and still no mainstream adoption. Sure its made big progress but the mountain still needs climbing.
If you consider central bank quantitative easing, deflation and rigged market captialism as a slight inconvenience you don't understand the "this is why we need bitcoin" mantra.
As for the outsiders looking in, their fiat money will continue to devalue. I cannot prevent them losing their wealth.

He is a highly respected and honoured man who volunteers all of his time educating and promoting bitcoin to hundreds and thousands of people. His best selling book is translated into multiple languages around the world. What have you contributed to the community? 
You see andreas helped his mother, a woman, get into bitcoin. 
You've gone through a lot of trouble attempting to smear him and its going to fail miserably. Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares what you think. You have demonstrated on a public forum to everyone what a horrible person you are.

@_date: 2019-03-01 22:29:35
Don't get me wrong I'm an Alex Jones fan. His rants are hilarious and some (not all) of his content is educational and entertaining. Unfortunately he is lying in this podcast.
Alex first heard about bitcoin in 2011 when Max Keiser told him about it (interview is still up on YouTube). Keiser recommended he accepted bitcoin on his infowars website so he can stop supporting the globalists. Bitcoin was probably worth a few dollars at the time. Alex even admitted several years later that he should have listened to Max (that confession is also on YouTube).

Your are right RT funds and networks his show you're so clever!
"The view and opinion expressed in the following program do not necessarily coincide with those of RT"
If you ever bothered to watch the show this message comes up before it begins. Max has complete editorial control and has actually been critical of the Kremlin before. My whole point is he doesn't care for RT or Russia he just uses them as a platform to express his rants. When he worked at the BBC he was instructed not to discuss certain topics (one example, Israel). If you know how journalism and media works you can understand why left.
Some of his rants I don't agree with but the huge majority of his content is awesome, not to mention the excellent big name guests that he interviews.

No disrespect intended but there is no evidence to suggest the bull market is going to end towards the end of 2019. You are merely following your gut instinct because the bear market started December 2017.
For all we know the bear market could last another 2 years....

Much like your friends at the Bank of England, you decide who is the dictator and who isn't. Its almost like you're "dictating" the narrative to suit your bias. See what I did there?
I should act like the Bank of England and freeze this discussion with you until your mind is fair and liberated. Then again you would probably support such behaviour.

Who wins the superbowl? Can't tell you it will change the course of history.

This is not financial advice. Don't spend more than what you're willing to lose. Don't let some reddit clown tell you the bull run is coming with no evidence 
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:38:51
I don't know exactly why but I can give you a quick history lesson.
It all started years ago when Alex Jones had Max Keiser on his show. Max advised alexs viewers to buy bitcoin when it was worth a few hundred dollars.
Fast forward a year or so later and max was on his show again, talking bitcoin and encouraging alex to accept bitcoin on the infowars website. During the phone interview alex showed footage of a Wikipedia article of tulip bulbs.....insinuating max is crazy and bitcoin was the same as the tulip mania.
About a year or so ago alex got roger ver on his show where roger started talking about bcash and how BTC was taken over by the evil Blockstream globalists. A fitting narrative for the type of audience alex has.
Maybe alex is a texan douchebag or he's too stubborn to admit max was right. If only he listened to max all along.... 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:04:12
You're a month late

I'm really quite surprised actually, for someone who's reached their moon you really don't have a clue what you're talking about. Do you seriously think Russia has any influence on the Keiser Report? Are you one of those people who still believes the evil Russians are out to get us?

Yes the block reward halves, does that mean it will automatically be bullish? If yes you'd advise your viewers to sell now and wait until just before the halvening to buy, which is obviously ridiculous advice.

A quick Google search doesn't make you an expert in Venezuelan politics. Your statements are so far from the truth I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
Interesting how all of a sudden you care so deeply for the wellbeing of the Venezuelan people just as John Bolton, the peace loving anti war politician with no links to the military industrial complex/ oil contractors, came out publicly saying how beneficial it will be for American oil companies to take over Venezuela oil reserves. Oh wait silly me, this has nothing to with oil but democracy for the Venezuelans.

I agree the article is worthless, but for a different reason.
You don't need an expert to tell you we haven't reached the bottom. There has been low volume for many many months with no sign of recovery. Wouldn't be surprised to see sub $2000 BTC.

Yes it's another shill conference. Everyone gets together to talk about the same shit as previous crypto conferences, making the same circular arguments and patting each other on the back for hodling. Moon lambos for everyone!!
Meanwhile, you're all invited to a conference for the USD community in a centralised location 
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:21:50

This post is deceptive. Looking at yearly lows doesn't mean shit. If BTC hits $1500 this year, which is entirely possible, your narrative becomes obsolete 
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:22:14
This is a bearish signal 
@_date: 2019-01-31 21:36:14
That's gonna be pretty hard to top.
Assuming 1 satoshi = $1.00 I'll be doing much similar work to you

Completely agree. Although my gut instinct tells me this is bearish. I base that on nothing
@_date: 2019-01-14 09:46:52
You both bring up some excellent points. For once bitcoin reddit doesn't have clueless noobs!
My 2 cents for 2019: hurts to says this, fiat USD will get stronger and potentially sub $2000 BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:34:40
Don't forget the clickbait titles:

When will BTC overtake the USD as the worlds reserve currency? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? 50 years? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:13:41
Don't waste your time reading this article. The bear market isn't over yet. There is no evidence to suggest on the contrary 
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:19:42
And after Chinese new year the Asians should buy more crypto.
Also wall street bonuses. Once received they should buy more crypto.

Wow this guy doesn't know enough about Bitcoin! Maybe he's deliberately spreading FUD so he can get in for cheap. Like Jamie Douchebag Dimon!
In saying that, you can tell the Bank of England are very well aware of whats going on in the crypto sphere. Maybe they know Bitcoin has the ability to make banks obselete and thus are a threat to their current monetary system?
You can tell he works for a British institution, calling Bitcoin a 'crypto asset' like a condescending piece of shit, typical in British culture.
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:38:22
On that logic BTC will go up because it does with every halvening

In Australia the cane toad was introduced to the ecosystem and caused longlasting devastating damage to the environment. Bitcoin is the cane toad that will cause fiat to become extinct!
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:30:47
I agree BTC isn't taken very seriously.
At the moment people prefer central controlled, worthless inflationary fiat. It's quick, convenient and easy to use. Unfortunately the same can't be said for BTC.
Ultimately I want BTC to be the world's reserve currency but it is a long long time before that happens. It might not even happen at all. Unless we have some sort of spectacular USD collapse, fiat will remain number 1
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:57:43

It doesn't matter what crypto you're using as long as the vendor accepts it. Only convert enough fiat to purchase your item. Don't store crypto in any darkweb wallet.
My opinion, go with BTC. There's an ongoing civil war within BCH at the moment and price  could plummet quickly.

Nobody actually gives a shit about 60 mins anymore
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:14:23
Agreed. You gonna need a lot of luck competing with &gt;3000 other cryptocurrencies. BTC doesn't spend a dime on advertising only the people who use it do.
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:08:16
Try Bisq

The reason why nobody posted is because this rumour has been going for over a year now and nothing gets done.
Your posting reinforces the rumour and people are fed up with it
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:10:37
Nobody cares about zionism anymore. Let them go to war with crypto they ain't gonna win
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:49:51
Oh dear me. I have travelled all over Ireland, dated Irish girls and worked with Irish people.
Northern Ireland still celebrate a 400 year old war by burning effigies. Its hate filled bile, has become a national embarrassment and the laughing stock of Europe. Thousands of taxpayer money is spent on a parades commission.... A PARADES COMMISSION!!!!! 
Yes sky news is unreliable and its not just crypto. Do you really think rupert murdoch wants crypto to succeed? Really have a good think about it. 
For arguments sake let's assume you're right, there's 100 thousand people in Belfast stockpiling gold. You really think that towers the millions of people who have spent hundreds of billions investing in crypto? Are you really thay naive? 
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:05:50
Most people are in crypto to get rich, I won't lie its myself included! And you are right its all about the price. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:16:33
Hahahaha oh dear me ������

Max used his show to advise his millions of viewers to buy bitcoin when it was $3. He helped many people become bitcoin millionaires.
What have you contributed to the crypto community?
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:59:00
I don't understand humans sometimes. Some people actually believe XRP is legit!
Same goes for Tron. Both coins are a complete waste of money.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:09:19
I agree money laundering isn't a crime. The problem is how to convince a judge
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:44:05
No please don't Saifedean isn't that good. 
Andreas Antonopolous or Max Keiser are far better ��
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:59:54
Institutional money coming: We were told this for many months over 2018. What a load of bullshit that was! 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:34:48
You're gonna have to explain yourself. Can't make a bold statement like that without some kind of evidence 
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:44:44
Very interesting indeed. Hopefully long term bullish
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:44:47
TLDR: No
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:47:27
You bring up some interesting points
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:15:19
Keanu Reeves has a couple of good ones. And you can never forget the Vegeta memes too ��

I agree Binance is a good exchange vs others. BNB however, is very questionable
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:13:33
You're 100% correct but it's not just Binance is it? Coinbase, Bittrex they are all crooked
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:54:44
Omar souled out! Don't bother listening to his worthless content anymore
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:15:29
Is this for real?
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:54:48
God I wish this was real. 85k BTC would make me so happy
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:39:35
Don't laugh. He might be right

If by some miracle he is actually Satoshi and dumps 1 million BTC it would mean cheap BTC for everyone to buy!

Where is your evidence?
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:18:12
We are spending 2 years in this bear market whether you like it or not.
Smile, relax and hodl. Eat more vegetables, go to the gym. Practise talking to girls, build your confidence. Be patient and the crypto gods will eventually reward you
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:59:46
No ID is needed at all. They are merely an intermediary for the transaction between you and the other party
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:35:50
I dunno man you're making a lot of assumptions. You seem to think you have satoshi figured out
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:01:41
Mt. Gox?

Finally a half decent article from bitcoinist. Makes a nice change from the garbage they usually spew.
Max is a clever man and makes excellent points about the banking system. All the major banks are insolvent. Central banks are fighting amongst each other to devalue their own currencies. This is why you dollar cost average bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:38:09
Why is 300KB better than 1MB?

People have been calling the end of a bear market for 6 months. 
To save you from watching this video and other videos/ articles claiming to call the end of bear market, let me save you some time.
WE HAVE ANOTHER 18 MONTHS OF BEAR MARKET.

Keanu is an awesome bitcoin meme �� there's another one from the matrix

Neither predictions will come true

Is the Dow Jones in a bubble?
I think yes, but didn't need the bitcoin chart to  confirm it. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:27:41
So many crypto noobs on YouTube/reddit. Ignore this video and channel. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:25:56
Correlation does not equal causation. Past doesn't predict the future. 
Please contribute something more worthwhile to the community. This post is a disservice to bitcoin reddit
@_date: 2018-12-04 07:05:30
Me too haha!! 
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:13:43
What are you smoking? Nowhere was your incoherent rambling remotely close to correct.
You really think BTC to hit 20k in 3 months???? GTF outta here! 
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:14:30
You have privacy worries then you recommend Apple? They are the absolute worst for privacy.

Hahaha this is so true!
Even Richard Heart, who I have a decent amount of respect for, called the bottom several hours ago. Boy was he wrong ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:34:41
Let them censor it. Don't worry about it brother. Bitcoin transcends borders, currency and human consciousness. It is too late for them to attempt control
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:13:10
Yes because you're the expert that knows better than everyone else.
BTC down 80% in 12 months. Goes up 10% in 48hours and you say the bull run is here. And of course you are right because you're the expert.....
The bear market isn't over because there isn't enough volume. Keep your panties on for now. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:37:32
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:05:34
Past performance does not indicate future price. 
Jesus man there are so many clueless crypto noobs posting shit they don't know about.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:51:54
I agree we're at capitulation/anger. Next bull run in 18-24 months possibly longer 
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:38:58
I'm assuming you mean 'mined out' instead of run out?
This would be better answered by an actual miner but I suspect they would be incentivized to process transactions. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:16:22
Bisq seems pretty good. I've had no problems with it ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:29:07
Are you assuming I think all altcoins are shitcoins?

100 000 btc soon.
See I can also make ambiguous predictions too :P
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:41:13
I could understand where mcafee is coming from. It's possible we will see $1 million BTC. It's just his timescale is off by a decade or so
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:41:16
I'm also a chief market analyst and I think the bitcoin price in 2 weeks is $40,000.
See how easy it is to make bullshit baseless predictions!
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:24:56
Oh dear......looks like Tone was right the whole time.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:47:05
Keep your panties on there's no vegeta memes yet.
Be patient and don't react with emotion. We can very easily correct to $5k.
