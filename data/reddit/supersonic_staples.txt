That's valid.   Subtle but valid nuance.

True, or they can expose what's really on the other person's mind.  Sleep talking is exactly how I uncovered my ex's affair.
All I'm saying is that little bit of sleep talk might make me go "hmmm"

Semi valid.   In a place where inflation and bank restrictions are insane (Venezuela, Zimbabwe), converting to BTC makes sense.
As a currency though, it's a complete failure due to rampant deflation.   Why spend today when that same thing will cost less BTC tomorrow?   
So then what your left with is using it as a vehicle to move funds out of country and/or store value.   Okay, now we're talking.   This I support, except add the caveat that for a lot of people, security and predictability of that wealth have a value as well.   The post you responded to was simply saying there comes a time when a smart person locks in their gains.   
You could (and would be smart to) do that too, by converting some BTC to gold/US currency/etc....via an offshore exchange.  At least that way, if BTC tanks, you're okay.

No?   Seems not only is everyone talking about bitcoin, but everyone (outside this sub) is sick of hearing about bitcoin.

I wasn't saying "sell", I was just bringing up an old wisdom is all....you make whatever decision you want to make.
The wisdom is known as the "odd lot" theory, basically the small investor is late with knowledge and tend to make bad/late investments.   Maybe that's happening here, maybe it isn't.   Time will tell.

Yep, I'd start quietly paying a bit more attention to her actions for a while.   Maybe nothing, but that doesn't sound good.

It's not a standard concern, exactly.   I've been a risk investor for a long time and playing with BTC isn't overly scary, however, that's not what I'm saying here.
If the market is being manipulated by a few players, it's no longer a fair market acting rationally.   It's important a market operate rationally, thus is somewhat understandable if not predictable.  Manipulations are illegal for a reason, mostly because the average user cannot rationally predict future trends and cannot reasonably make a rational decision as the markets are moving more on manipulation tactics than on economics and information.
That's what I meant by "holding the bag".   But yes, I'm getting very close to abandoning the market because of perceived manipulation, continuing to play might be profitable, but who knows, it's looking more and more like a rigged casino.

It's not compared to traditional global markets, but it is $17,250,000 worth of sell wall that's been in place, nibbled, in place, repeat for a while now.    Sure, it can be taken down, but that requires an $18m bet by someone.    
There are all kinds of strategies that can be employed by someone with enough cash to depress or increase a price (just about all are illegal).   The BTC market share isn't that spectacular in the grand scheme of things, thus making it more vulnerable.
Having said that, if someone's using $17.2m to try and depress the market to protect futures profits, I'm hoping it backfires and takes this guy to the cleaners.

Good for you, I'm happy to hear it.   It sounds like you have a sound head on your shoulders and properly understand risks.
Still, I never assumed anything about your particular situation.   I was just agreeing with this bit of logic that says "HODL come hell or high water" makes little sense given volatility and BTC's use as a store of wealth long term.   There's nothing wrong with hodling, but there's nothing wrong with making a personal decision regarding when to cash out and solidify profits.
It sounds like you've made that decision, which is excellent.   It's sound investment advice for anything, pick a profit level and cash out and enjoy vs. trying to time the absolute high point of a market.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:30
True, however there's an old wisdom in investing where if you're hearing about an investment from your neighbour/mailman/random gas station guy, it's probably time to cash out.

If it's a true margin short (which it seems to be), there is no strike date.  The guy that made the bet has two choices when the price goes up instead of down, he either needs to close out the position, or front more money to cover a margin call.   So long as he covers the margin, he can sit on a short for as long as he wants.

You do this because you've agreed to sell 1BTC to the option holder for $17,500 in 30 days.   Lets say he paid $200 for that contract.  The buyer bought in because he's betting 1BTC in 30 days will be worth $18k+, so he can buy at the contract price and immediately flip for a profit.
The guy that wrote the contract agreed to sell the 1BTC @ $17,500.   He's betting in 30 days the price of 1BTC will be less than $17,500.   If that happens, the contract either expires and the writer keeps the 1BTC and the price of the contract (just made $200), or the contract is exercised and the writer sells the 1BTC for above market at $17,500 and makes the profit off of it.
None of that is illegal.
Now, if we write that contract and you buy it, that's based on a good faith bet.   Then, if I use my stockpile of BTC, I put up a sell wall at, say, $17,250 which acts as a ceiling.   A lot of demand would be needed to soak up that wall and get by it.   If the sell wall works (it should, it signals to the market there's huge interest in selling at $17,250 thus depressing price),  the price stays low.   In 30 days, the call expires, and the writer gets to keep all of his BTC AND his profits from writing the now-expired contracts.

Misses the point.   Tulip Mania was just the first known mass economic bubble where the demand was driven purely on a speculated price increase.
To say BTC isn't in a bubble is plain wrong.   The demand exists because of a mass influx of wealth into Bitcoin, which has pushed the price way, way up, generating hype and more money to flood into the ecosystem.   That's, unfortunately unstable.   
There really are only one of two ways to view this, either bitcoin is the new gold and now has enough legitimacy that people are willing to let a portion of their wealth to be stored in coin, thus sustaining the high price, or the price is fuelled mostly by price increase, and eventually the price will get to a point where not enough new money is flooding into the system to sustain the high prices and the whole thing collapses back to a reasonable level.
Don't get me wrong, you can make a LOT of money on a speculation bubble, just make sure you get out before the music stops.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:57:27
Depends when the strike date is.   If you write a few $mil worth of 30 day calls @ $17,500, you only need to hold that wall for 30 days before you've safely made that few $mil.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:13:47
Nope.   The DotCom bubble and the US Housing Bubble had shady mechanisms that fed new money into the bubble, and ONLY new money can make the price go up.    
There's been a lot of new money pushed into BTC.   If someone robbed a bank for that money, that's illegal, but doesn't change the fact it's the new money that's fuelling this (and every other bubble ever).

Same problem plagued Sears.   Once a business gets trapped in the "everything is on sale" model, it's really hard to get back out.

Assuming not sarcasm, there's nothing wrong with locking in your profits.   NEVER get caught up in what could have been.   If your goal was to get in at $10,000 and get out at 10.5 and lock in a quick 5% gain, then your move was a success.

Victim of the 3 d's....Death, Divorce, or Destitution.   Those 3 D's fuel the economy like you wouldn't believe with people having to sell even when they don't want to.
