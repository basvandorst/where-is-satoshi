I agree, so why spiral relentlessly towards a zero value currency? A dollar with zero value is the inevitable outcome.

In your case then, your wages would just decrease less than the rate of deflation and your real wage would still be increasing as long as the value you create continues to rise.  
You may be experiencing income boosts, but most are not. 
I'm not saying bitcoin would end wars, its not really a robust enough solution for global monetary systems. 


I disagree.
But philosophically I also think the current monetary system we have enables and creates incentives for reckless/wasteful spending and destruction of the environment, it also provides a near endless spending power to the US government which is clearly abusing that power. Also that it does not have to be that way, that we could have a system that rewards careful intelligent conservation and consumption and that punishes reckless waste.

Then you do not want to live under the current system. Real wages have declined roughly 20% since the 1970s, roughly the same time something else happened... 


Yep, and people would have been willing to pay for it because as you mention it was worth fighting. 
No how about all the other senseless wars we've blown our wad on since? 
Korea? Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan? Libya.. 


Yea sounds like the boom and bust that still happens with the modern fiat regime, except now we have price controls on money as the supposed solution.

if we are really concerned about climate change, A system designed to work off inflation is a bad idea. It incentives and encourages consumption of resources, where as a deflationary framework would discourage wasteful consumption and encourage people to only consume what is actually required. 
I get that the current fiat economic system has enabled rapid growth, but please keep in mind that what we have now is not the only way forward.

Deflation is only bad in the context of a system that is designed in such a way it fails if deflation occurs like the one we have now. 


That is one hypothetical. Another one could be, without inflationary currency governments would have to pay the full cost of war instead of intentionally reducing the debt by eroding it via inflation. This would create a very large incentive to not waste resources in wars, as the resultant taxes would be VERY unpopular. Instead of racking up trillion dollar debts in various wars around the world,we would have stayed home and invested those resources into something productive like in our own energy infrastructure. PS we are still burning coal for heat. 


I'm not sure how deploying capital to things that do not produce value is a positive example in favor of what we've got now. The objective of any currency and monetary system is to deploy capital efficiently, building rich man toys at a loss is not an efficient use of capital. 


Sure. But the amount of energy bitcoin is using is peanuts compared to the rest of the finance industry.

Coin base has really gone downhill. Their website is prone to error, verifying my id took hours of fiddling before it finally successfully uploaded.
These guys are gonna get hacked if their trend toward getting g sloppy continues.
