Keep track of every trade you do and let's say you did 1000 trades. Add them all up if you made a profit or if you lost money. Once you have the final number if it's a positive number you owe 38% if it's a negative number you don't owe taxes because you didn't make any profit

Your sentiment towards the correction. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:41
Chill out man you only been 3 months in and are screaming profits.  Market moves in waves. Just remember when you read posts like I sold my house to buy btc that's when you sell.  And when you read 50 posts a day about people  getting frustrated and selling that's when you buy.  This is the correction institutional and many others investors were waiting for. Give it couple more weeks.
