Why is negative criticism automatically trolling? These are the genuine conclusions I've come to after researching Bitcoin and Blockchain.

Blockchain is almost as useless as Bitcoin. It has very little real world use cases where a traditional relational database with transactions wouldn't more than suffice. It's a neat P2P technology and might have some niche applications but for the most part it's a solution without a problem. It's not valuable relative to the existing solutions it's touted to replace.

Bitcoin is almost completely useless. My prediction is the price will keep depreciating over the coming years. If I want to buy something I use my phone which is accepted everywhere. It's instant, secure, I get cash back and I build credit. So why would people use Bitcoin which offers none of these things? Most people don't want and don't care about "features" like decentralization and deregulation. Bitcoin speculators convince themselves that these are real selling points and mass adoption is right around the corner. If you profited from speculating on Bitcoin you just duped a greater fool and wasted resources.

Any legitimate criticism of shitcoin.

He never discusses the price because he’s smart enough to realize how much of a colossal bubble bitcoin is in. Bitcoin is not revolutionary.

Bitcoin and Blockchain are overhyped technologies that won't be revolutionary.
