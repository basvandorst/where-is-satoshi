This depends on if you want Bitcoin to have a savings type role or a currency type role. This is the same reason India had bimetalism. Silver was used for everyday transactions and gold for large value ones. Since gold and silver could be swapped directly (atomic swaps) or at exchanges this worked. Other countries used currency representing a small portion of gold.
Either of these could work if we can accept a future with two dominant cryptos. Personally I think ether type is better suited to cash role and Bitcoin type to gold type role.

Just because bitcoin needs the blockchain doesn't mean the reverse is true.  Bitocin is a liot of diffrnet things to a lkot of diffrne tpeople(just like gold is money a useful non-oxidising contact, a soft metal, and jewellery) Use of one function doesn't invalidate the others.

Sure.  But then most people don't care about the switches and routers and servers and data centres they would care if they were turned off and you couldn't get Facebook or reddit anymore. If some alt becomes as widesreas as visa or MasterCard they might.

No they are not companies. However 14 blocks were mined before realise of Bitcoin so somebody ( satoshi and/ or others got 700 bitcoin) so in this case there is no monetary incentive to create this coin. Worse once you add in transaction fees to pay for the alt. Your going to have to price it below $1. Where is the incentive to mine? The popular proposal of creating a backed alt doesn't work because there is no way for the cost to be covered.
Funding who will cover the electric bill for the miners when they won't be able to make a return?
Unless people are

I thought it's basic function was being a distributed ledger, not a currency. That just happens to be the most common use.

Big question here. Is there a necessity for a crypto which can maintain stability relative to fiat without a third party involved.
Is the ability to prevent the losses enough to overcome the lack of gains? Who would buy crypto if they could not make money off it?

@_date: 2018-01-06 17:28:28
How much would you pay for an altcoin that could keep a stable value of $1 per coin? The trouble is if the price  is not greater than $1 where does the funding come from?
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:14:14
Which is what makes stabilising price hard or maybe impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:44:19
An improvement in cryptocurrency  does not always mean an improvement in Bitcoin value though.

3) could certainly answer 1 in the affirmative if people will pay there is a need. Although the answer nobody to three would not answer 1.
The answer to 2 tells us if this can be accomplished by an altcoin or if we have to rely on BTC. Even if another coin is required for the future that doesn't stop any of the rest of your list from being true.
Granted if it is BTC or litecoin or something else is mainly a question of interest to technically and economically.

Agree there is likely to still be enthusiastic if small username in that scenario.

Bitcoin gets it value because it has a limited supply and is liked by some people (just like conch shell money)
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:27:17
I've gone off topoc. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:17:07
Ok so slightly silly. However if btc would get to one million per btc then have no drop or rise in value. That would lose all speculation at that value.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:20:25
Intresting. One crypto to each fiat. (USD crypto, EUR crypto) would allow for quicker transactions than a world Bitcoin as there would be multiple blockchain. Although the real question is how easily it has to be exchanged for the real thing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:07:02
Note that conch shell money is still in use today. So a massive drop in pricd and loss of interest doesn't necessarily mean the loss of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:43:12
I wouldn't be massively surprised if BTC crashed because another crypto was able to beat it out at some point down the road. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:53:54
You should read bitcoin's whitepaper
I have. Satoshi's intended use was a "peer to peer electronic cash system" that does not mean it is its basic function (or process,  ask, or task)  It is a disturbed ledger with proof of work and an entire network that can be validated by anyone node. Humans (or if you prefer the market) have assigned a monetary use and value to that task.

Hard to tell satire with bitcoin...


It's a documented thing in some situations.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:18:33


That's true of Bitcoin too. How are you going to maintain the full nodes, the power plants to sustain them,the infrastructure to get the fuel to the power plant, convert it to electric and send it on. Whose going to produce the transformer oil? Whose going to provide the power to keep the internet infrastructure needed for transactions? Maybe solar power, but how many solar panel factories can you build in a post apocalyptic wasteland?
Chances are that would lead to things like cigarettes being used as currency.
@_date: 2018-09-08 07:53:07
I haven't no. I was thinking about the use of ciagrettrs in prison though it osa great comparison. How many prisoners  use buttcoins as currency and how many use cigarettes when fiat is unavailable?

Is shitcard.
MasterCard and Visa are ubiquitous. Some places will even take them and not cash! I've rarely seen Amex acceptance outside of hotels and airports.
@_date: 2018-09-02 07:00:47
How about visa like scale, security, transaction costs, ease of use and non volatility?
Or they could just use MasterCard/visa

Whats the bet they say you can only buy whole bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:35:49
For interstellar distances this might make sense. Transaction times will be measured in years anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:18:27
There is a reason  some of these exchanges don't allow usd either way. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:35:26
There are non divisible currency wirh only one unit. Like the Chilean peso. Think of that as a satoshi

Yep. Take out buy to let loans to reduce the demand is one proposed method of action on house price reduction which is not too dissimilar from the above remove credit argument j7sy a matter of degree.

I'm always amazed by the buttcoiners who don't use 2FA, I mean the 2 of 2 multisignature is right there in the protocol.
Sure brain wallets might be easy to guess, though I wonder what  the chances are of guessing *both* correctly.
