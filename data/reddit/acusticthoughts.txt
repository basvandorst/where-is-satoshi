The internet is a strange place...as the rhetoric continues:
There are so many convincing scenarios of low, but not super low, probability that these kinda dull out in your senses. [Risk Assesment]( is not the everyday humans best ability. We sometimes ignore the common risks (car accidents?) while the scary things (terrorism) dominate our planning. I guess this has to do with our ability to react to a slow moving thing (the price slowly falling because of lack of interest over time) versus a fundamental code issue that immediately destroys value (terrorism?). And all of that rhetoric points back to my original point...
There are tons of ways for BTC to slowly lose value and turn to nothing - you've just not accepted that any one of them will happen, though, deep down you still harbor the standard human doubt on its ability to be  That I have not put forth a great argument for any particular position - does not mean one of the positions won't be it.

Your clarification is false, again. Gold is valuable because people believe they can use it as currency - as it was used in the past, and is in certain situations - if the shit hits the fan. Because gold has a history of being used as currency - it has value. Bitcoin needs to be used as currency - to have a purpose - in order for people to trust its use as currency, which is actually what gives it value.
Value is derived from utility.

Bitcoin usage has gone from $Very Low to $Much Higher - if you compare actual usage to coins in existence, actual new number of users compared to coins you will find deflationary probability increasing quickly. Additionally, the inflation of the next 13 million coins stops in ten years. Unless you plan on dying real soon - deflationary pressure is right around the corner.

@_date: 2014-10-06 11:52:51
Reserves - I thought you were talking about backed by something...I know what factional means - and that line doesn't apply to Bitcoin because you don't have bitcoin banks. You have trading between individuals. And individuals always trade among each other with cash that is fully reserved by the actual cash on hand.
Free and easy - yes, miners do have something to do with it because they are verifying the transactions and they have bought billions fo dollars worth of computer built upon trillions of dollars of infrastructure. Not free and easy.
'potentially vastly more' is not equivalent to free and easy.
You state it is valuable due to increases based upon algoriths. That is not necessarily a benefit.

Help me with this - what other choice do we have? Someone showed me a poly-something law type recently that keys you constantly choose to opt in, but it seems a little pie in the sky. How would society interact when this person has no consequences for an action and this one does - but they're next to each other trying to interact? The cost of trust is significant in a transaction - and you'd have to vet every transaction even more than we do now.
And while we - today, right now - think, 'hey - I'M getting fucked! No fair!' - well, reality - REALITY - is that no one EVER has been able to choose their life's circumstances.
I see true anarchy able to arise when two things happen: we all have quantum computers integrated into ourselves to help us analyze decisions (mostly financial) and when we have a nano skin that protects us from physical constraints. Once our mind and body can be free from imposition - then anarchy can bloom, until them we are dependent upon each other and obligated to protect the weak.

I'm not fully getting the question. The money to buy the capital stock goes into - I think you are asking where does the 6% interest rate on the money banks are forced to store in the Fed go. The answer is: it goes to the bank that collected the deposits in the first place - the member banks.
The reason this is not a bullshit move by the banks or the Fed: the banks, if not forced to cooperate with each other and deposit this cash, would have been able to make MORE THAN 6% on that money by deploying it. Instead - the original Federal Reserve architects had to figure out a way to create stability in the early banking system. One way to do that was to FORCE other banks to loan money to each other even when times were complex. How do you do that? Part of the answer is to always have some of their money - and how do you get them to be 'ok' (though not happy) with giving up some of their money? You offer them interest on it.
One of the major reasons for the MANY economic crashes that happened QUITE OFTEN in the late 1800s and early 1900s was that news of a bank run across the country would travel much faster than the actual economic ailment leading toward banks cutting each other off for no damn reason often than herd mentality fear, which would further exacerbate what might or MIGHT NOT have been an economic issue.

It isn't hard when you went to school for economics and political science to know that the main purpose of this bank is communication of rules among each other. I've actually visited the building before. So why don't you give us all an education on how much money this bank lends out? I'd like to see the numbers because as of yet their paltry reserves of gold and SDRs mean nothing in the real world. Their 'liquidity' offerings through the IMF - what do they really do? C'mon...reality - not what people want them to do. Reality.

No one can be certain of anything - just like your beliefs on bitcoin. However, we can be certain that Bitcoins production will show exponentially. What we do know though - If population growth continues Bitcoin will not keep up without significant pressure of cost per coin meaning people will cease to hold as a means of exchange (the purpose of money) but as an investment which will limit it's utility.

The movement however will accelerate - remember the productivity and value creation is accelerating in human society, meaning demand growth for bitcoin will eventually outstrip bitcoin growth exponentially. Meaning - at some point - that 20 years will be 10 years, then 5 years, then...daily?

Merchant Service costs are compelling for businesses. Those who send money home to foreign countries would also benefit.
Individuals have already missed the gold rush of generating your own bitcoins. In countries with lacking banking infrastructure – Africa – maybe there is opportunity, however mobile banking is doing a good job of penetrating already.
There might be enough Libertarians – antistate – gold bugs - inflation hounds to keep bitcoin viable. However, I'm not sure if there's enough to make it flourish and compete with fiat and it's ubiquity.

1. Reserve? What is it reserved by? Who will back up bitcoin if it crashes?
2. Free and easy? The electricity to mine or the computers to verify aren't free. And it definitely isn't easy as it requires a global network of computers coming together in one of the largest concentrations of computing power ever assembled.
3. Security seems pretty solid. :-)
4. Arguably this is a flaw in that growth of supply will at some point fall short of growth of producitivity and value. This will lead toward the 'value' of a money unit to increase creating potentially interesting situations.
5. But not free.
6. Human existence is not necessarily algorithmic....though I would probably argue the opposite at some point.
7. Definitely not cheap - right now the costs are being underwritten through mining, however, that will fade.
8. Scarcity might be a long term issue. Money should align with the value of work and 'things' in society, not the other way around. Money has no value - it is representative of the things that do. So to have a money that suddenly stops aligning itself in volume with available value is a challenge. One of many reasons we left the gold standard.
9. Authentication - good.

"**A meeting place for central banks**
Currently more than 5,000 senior executives and officials from central banks and supervisory agencies participate in meetings organised by the BIS every year.
The most important meetings held at the BIS are the regular meetings of Governors and senior officials of member central banks. Held every two months in Basel, these gatherings provide an opportunity for participants to discuss the world economy and financial markets, and to exchange views on topical issues of central bank interest or concern. The main result of these meetings is an improved understanding by participants of the developments, challenges and policies affecting various countries or markets. An atmosphere of openness, frankness and informality amongst participants is critical to the success of BIS meetings.
Other meetings of senior central bank officials focus on the conduct of monetary policy, the surveillance of international financial markets and central bank governance issues.
In addition, the BIS organises frequent meetings of experts on monetary and financial stability issues as well as on more technical issues such as legal matters, reserve management, IT systems, internal audit and technical cooperation. Though targeted mostly at central banks, BIS meetings sometimes involve senior officials and experts from other financial market authorities, the academic community and market participants.
**Research and statistics**
The economic, monetary, financial and legal research of the BIS supports its meetings and the activities of the Basel-based committees. The BIS is also a hub for sharing statistical information amongst central banks, and for publishing statistics on global banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets.
Research is carried out primarily by BIS staff, supplemented by visiting researchers from central banks and the academic community. From time to time, the BIS organises special meetings and conferences with central bank researchers and academics.
This research finds its way into the Bank's regular publications, such as the Annual Report and Quarterly Review, and into its BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as external publications such as professional journals.
**Seminars and workshops**
Through seminars and workshops organised by its Financial Stability Institute (FSI), the BIS promotes dissemination of the work undertaken by the supervisory community. The FSI not only familiarises financial sector supervisors worldwide with the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, but also provides practical training for senior participants.
Cooperation with regional central bank groupings also helps to make information about BIS activities more widely known. This cooperation takes the form of participation in meetings by regional central bank groups and the organisation of ad hoc joint meetings or workshops.
**Banking services for central banks**
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services to assist central banks and other official monetary institutions in the management of their foreign reserves. Some 140 customers, including various international financial institutions, currently make use of these services. BIS financial services are provided out of two linked trading rooms: one at its Basel head office and one at its office in Hong Kong SAR."

Dear folks, 
Russia 's gas and oil is already not that important. That's why the price has fallen. Do you suddenly think Putin has lowered the price voluntarily? Sigh.
Secondly - I've got a feeling the world will find more oil for dollars than for gold available in the market - meaning Putin would be forced to sell at a gold discount (further lowering the oil price).
Third - in the real world, where 7 billion plus people actually get shit done daily, gold is a triviality. It is used by a bunch of Indians for decoration mostly. Besides the volume of gold relative to the global economy - hah! Useless material.

Some of the ideas (not sure yet what will be the most interesting to users, so still experimenting):
1. Professional has a very specific engineering question (maybe some math need be worked out, something created in CAD, a problem need be better explained, etc). They post question with a small price they'd pay for answer and if they accept answer money goes to person who answers.
2. The current format on the site is a one a day question. We have models we want to spin off of this (one in particular would be for those who are planning on taking the PE/FE and want to get their education in tiny bites). We offer up question - then click answer, and to see the answer or see the work done to get the answer they pay a small amount. We'd want a tool that only opens the page when someone pays.
3. I think that it is for now...the real key is that bite size engineering information for a small price (equivalant to $.99?) would be valuable to both buyer and sell.
Any other thoughts - techniques - apis - would all be helpful. Thank you!

If 100% of Bitcoins were held - and never spent, value would drop to zero. If 100% of Bitcoins were spent and constantly circulated - value would be greater than zero.
People want things because of the utility of them. If something has no utility - it has no value.
In fact - one of the greatest reasons that bitcoin is valuable to the broader world is because of its unique ability to cut down on transaction costs. When Bitcoin is spent in business it increases demand - and increases in utility - and increases in price.

Flawed analogy that you're feeding this circlejerk. 99% of noted criminals use shoes. However, 99% of the world uses shoes, as such, only a small percentage of shoe wearing commit crimes.
Bitcoin however has relatively significant percentages committing crimes (including every person who has made money in the US but not paid taxes). In fact - I'd bet 25% or bitcoin users commit crimes, if not more.

Outside of black holes we can predict it damn near perfectly. We don't yet know where it comes from, but it is doubtful that you can find a situation where we cannot predict the forces. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:44:17
Actually those things we can model within the rules of gravity and understand how it works. We cannot model human nature. That is why economics and the 'law' of supply and demand is not a law. There are significant numbers of variables that cannot be modeled.
Preceptor cannot be modeled. If it could Wall Street would not vary, people would always know what's going on. But they do not and cannot. Too many variables. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:35:48
Incorrect. Increases in supply don't always force price down. Sometimes a supply increase will lead toward greater belief in an material and an increase in demand. This demand increase will keep prices stable.
Economic Law is exactly not law because it is based upon Human Actions that is not rational. It is full of paradox and complexity.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:21:50

@_date: 2015-08-24 13:24:27


That's all I've been trying to say. That is why 'Supply and Demand' is not a Law in the sense of Gravity. It is not consistently able to predict the outcome of a situation. As such - and this is the real reason for this conversation - we cannot assume that Bitcoin will go **To the Moon!!!** simply because of a limited supply. In fact, evidence based upon global monetary policy suggests that it will NOT become a reserve currency due to inherent limitations of managing global economies with a supply constrained money source.
I like the Theoretical Economists hoping that we will suddenly begin to act rationally abd that 'laws' of economics will become predictable...however...I doubt that will occur as it seems having a fluid currency is more useful and human nature will not shift.
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:31:24
Still waiting. How do you account for humans when creating a law? Cmon you dumb fuck old man. Why are you avoiding reality? Let's go you old arrogant piece of excrement. Scientists agree, you're a tool. Answer the question old man.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:00:24
You definitely cannot call it a law of there is no model. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:26:02
No, let me rephrase it so you don't get happy. You cannot find a situation where gravity cannot be solved for outside of a black hole. However, I can find hundreds of examples right now where supply and demand break down.
Nice try though. Cute almost.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:42:38
Actually it is quite easy to argue that away. If people's taste changes, it is of no relevance what the supply is, no demand means no demand. Even if you have one bitcoin in the whole world - if there is no demand for the product then it will be valueless.
In fact, one reason bitcoin is still fighting for life is that the supply of places to use it is so low. Since the barriers of ease of transaction are high it is expensive to use. Lots supply in this case means lower utility and lower demand.
There's your logic. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:07:36
I'd argue that we've done an amazing job with global economics. We've brought global poverty from 99% to 10%. We now have global economic networks. The number of economic collapses before and after the Fed came into existence is a far difference. We have consistently increased our standard of living and health. We're on the cusp of a second global Renaissance where we just might free ourselves from limitations of food, energy and poverty. You can talk about the variability of interest rate - but that is the cost for long term stability. And the inflation since the beginning of the Fed, I'd argue, is relatively tame compared to the massive increase in productivity that has occurred over the same time period.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:38:19

And I'll say now that they are no where near laws. They are great guidance - however this is a much greater difference than semantics. There are major issues with supply and demand that constantly arise.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:21:12
Nope. All of the value of Bitcoin and the network is based upon its utility as a replacement for cash. By definition cash does not have intrinsic value as such Bitcoin nor the supporting infrastructure behind it doesn't have value.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:33:19
Which is why supply and demand is not a law, but guidance. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:16:57
Exactly. None of these things haven't Trinsic value. They have value based upon the trust and utility of their usage in the general population. Things like food and air seem to have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:33:20
I can see that you're not an economist. Economists recognize that supply and demand is a hypothesis. It is not a theory. That is why you cannot show an equation for it. You can only show talks and thoughts about it. Show me an equation. Then it might be a theory. However you cannot show an equation because this is only a hypothesis that has many many times that it is not exactly true. Gravity is always true. As such it is a theory of gravity. This might be above your head but you should look up the difference between hypothesis and theory.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:20:21
While you're on it might be in jest, it represents the reason supply and demand is not a law. The variables of reality are too many to model for economics. Human nature is complex and irrational.

Interesting, so what you want to do is simplify your equation to the point where does it represent reality. Maybe it's time for you to get out of economics 101 and join economics 401 when we realize that that equation is flawed.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:06:54
Because humans are involved, and since we've not 'solved' for humans we've not solved for supply and demand. All variables within the above equation of gravity are solvable. Not all variables within supply and demand are solved for.
Analogy is flawed because of human beings not being rational actors. End of discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:14:22
Then please show of an equation just like the law of gravity that will dictate exactly what occurs.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:32:50
If you want something to be a law then it must be definable. If you want something to be a hypothesis with guidance then you can call it whatever you want, but it is not a law. And yes - evidence must exist for something to be hard truth. Otherwise it's lies at the edge of possibility but not necessarily true.
We have plenty of evidence for evolution moron. We also have plenty of evidence to show that supply and demand is not a hard law. Evidence bitch.
Perception is motion and can be manipulated via propaganda. If something can be manipulated with mere words then it is definitely not a law. It is a hypothesis with many variables that cannot be models. Not a theory.
It sounds like you're spewing shit from your economics 101 class, try taking economics for one then get back to us.

@_date: 2015-08-23 21:58:43
Yes. It is a complex equation. Human beings are involved and we have not 'solved' for human beings, unlike everything involved in gravity (minus inside black holes). Humans are weird. As such, the whole purpose of us arguing, we cannot assume the limited supply of bitcoin will drive demand.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:46:37

Standard answer from somebody who doesn't know reality. I can show you plenty of times where supply and demand are not tied together. Supply and demand is a general concept. It does not apply like gravity. Your hypothesis has been shown not to be a theory like gravity. Thank you for playing. Let's send you home with some nice door prizes to make you feel better. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:53:39
Thus our quandary.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:55:55
The point is that the equation is much more dynamic when involving supply and demand. Trust is the most important factor when considering if a 'thing' (bitcoin) will become a reserve currency, or even move beyond the techies, libertarians and drug buyers. While these groups have shown that they can support a currency (I do consider bitcoin money) - bitcoin has not yet moved to the general population for many reasons.
Just because supply is limited with bitcoin, the price is not infinitely upward mobile. To the Moon is cool - but let's cool it with the foolishness and focus on this fork. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:36:24

And therein lies the flaw. How can we have a market act in a rational predictable manner if the actors don't act in a rational predictable manner. Supply and demand did not change as we approached the 2008 housing bubble. In fact supply stayed the same.

Since Bitcoin is mostly used as a medium of transfer versus directly being spent, you'd only need to ban bank transactions with bitcoin and then attack the hosting companies with the mining pools and coin exchanges. You would suddenly limit to online transactions with groups that don't want to use in fiat ever.
The FBI/NSA is patient and would win the long game because general investors, mom and pop users and definitely institutional investors would move away. At this point bitcoin would begin to lose relevance. It'd still be there, just not of importance.

The precedent thing I do not know about...I am not sure whether there have been any cases of law or significant experience with Bitcoin before. We really are in new territory with this particular financial device. However, there are many similar devices in place - for instance, my birth city - Great Barrington, MA has its own currency. When you purchase, pay or earn - there is no difference to doing the same work in dollars. You just do a quick currency exchange calculation and back to normal.

There is no guarantee of course. Any real stock broker knows that. The question about quantifying though is a real one - because you can quantify. I do not know if the types of tools have developed for bitcoin as have for the broader stock markets.
For instance, one easy way to quantify a floor is to see how many people have a 'buy' in place at a certain price, or to see where the market has placed their short positions. There are a lot of tools to project where the floor might exist - I just don't think we have the market size in BTC yet to have those tools.

@_date: 2012-10-17 19:21:02
For the coins to have value they have to be usable in the marketplace. If we hoard so much of them they will have no value - no marketplace will develop around them. These coins need to be used - otherwise they are valueless. Hoarding something valueless is stupid.
Spend 50% or 75% of your damn coins! The marketplace needs it to develop.

That is what I feel is the key driver that can make this sustainable. We can only save for so long - eventually you gotta buy some shit. This would seem to significantly change the logic of spending money though - might we revert to a day when buying the expensive high quality product is a better investment than the cheap replaceable component? Will this make our economy a 'slower' one - meaning will the average consumption of individuals drop relative to today's consumption patterns? Will we become less wasteful? How did we act back in the day when the gold was the standard? Were there similar price pressures on gold then as well (price of gold increasing slowly over long time periods)?

We were looking for about 5 to 6 video cards.
I'm wondering though - does having a dual CPU setup really increase hash rate that much? Do you have any stats on the type of production we are going to get out of these machines?
I say that because there is a guy selling a $500 rig that will generate about a bitcoin a month. That'll lead to the system paying itself off in about six or seven months (when accounting for cost of electricity)

@_date: 2012-01-06 17:34:18
My buddy and I have been working on the numbers for about three months now. We are happy as long as the price of a coin stay above $2.43 with our current models. Cost of electricity is cheap here. As well, if the coins spike to around $10 - we can make our money back in a month or two and at that point everything is cake, so we'll just let the damn thing run.
Below that number and the return on investment starts getting into three and four year time frames and we're not interested in that for such a small monetary amount.

4.5% devaluation versus annual GDP of 55trillion Yuan equals 2 trillion'ish Yuan lost in devaluation. Thus Bitcoin increase in value is roughly equal to 2% of one off loss from devaluation. Not huge - but not trivial.

Price should stay the same because the total amount of bitcoins available will be the same. The biggest change will be that different individuals will be mining bitcoins - people buying the ASIC versus everyone who had a video card. This dynamic MIGHT change pricing - as these individuals with these coins will have different habits than the previous generation of miners. Maybe coins will flood the market because these individuals will sell immediately instead of holding or maybe it'll be exactly the same because most miners do sell...I obviously don't know that last part.

Value arises from utility I'd guess. The utility of food (or energy...I know the word is changing but that is what it fundamentally is) arises from physics within the universe. All interactions need energy.
As such - the fundamental physics of the universe is where the traits that the essence of what food is lead to those traits being universally valuable. And that these traits are 'the essence' of what food is means they are inherent values in food.

Even when there is an insane surplus of food - only the extra food that cannot be utilized loses value, the rest of the food that is still needed by people have value. And people ALWAYS need food.

The fundamental unit of food is energy. You remove energy from the equation - all the wonderful stuff you said above means nothing to a body. A body cannot get the gold, a body cannot whine about being drowned, a body can do nothing - energy is the end all in our universe.
You can theorize a new universe where energy is of no relevance - go for it.
Energy - which is what food fundamentally is - is the only thing every person always needs. Whether they are eating it, or whether it is in their body being used.
Atoms needs energy to stay together - even if you cut them down to their fundamental states - if they lose all energy, they cease to exist.
Energy is the base of the universe, and from it all value every arises. Energy's fundamental value - its inherent value - is the fact that it powers all transactions everywhere. Nothing can exist without it. Not atoms, not the big bang, not the universe, not philosophers, nothing.

Even if they have chosen to cease eating at any particular moment - their body's still need the food that is circulating inside of them allowing them to  do anything (including the need for food in the system to have the energy to avoid eating anymore). Once all food and all energy is removed from a system - it is no longer life.

2,620 BTC at today's market price is about $210,000. 2400W equals about $3,153 in electricity in first year - and lets just say it costs the same amount to cool the house. So total cost during the cost of the year will be about ($30k + $3.1k + $3.1K) is $36,000ish.

They represent real things being built, real people creating value. As such - dollars aren't going exponential - they are probably keeping up with global growth and demand.
 - Your data points are too few, time frames too short, way to early in a curve to decide what its moving toward.

Not only fees, but as a retailer, you want to increase your chances of selling stuff. If you can dedicate a small amount of your computers toward verifying transactions - you make more money as a company by keeping a currency alive. I would guess at some point there will be an association of bitcoin approved vendors who, in order to get on the marketing list to show off their wares, would HAVE TO MINE as a requirement to join.

The the value of something to someone changes at various time does not change the absolute value of the item. When all things in the universe cease to need energy - then we can have that conversation.
And yes, even a Jain fasting to death needs energy to reach that moment. To CHOOSE to fast to death is a choice made using energy.

Correct. However, with the way we have seen hedge funds act in the real world, versus their theoretical actions - we should be able to use common sense to recognize that they will not act like standard market players. As they have been shown to constantly do - they will manipulate the markets illegally to the best of their abilities.
If I saw hedge funds act in a responsible manner then I would not have this negative opinion.

Your 'knowledge' needs growth. Reality is complex. History is littered with those who had plans on power. You hear about the grandiosity of domination in past times - but truth is 98.9% of history was people walking, talking and fucking on their own. These assholes trying to scare the little ones into gold know that you like little kid stories - just like the loony religious folk - your bedtime story involves a different - big brother bogeyman.

That one line is interesting and very much shows that judgment call. The last paragraph at the end of the argument points out that the market really looks at speculation in terms of risk versus timing. Additionally, when looking at other definitions (professional - not wikipedia) the focus is on risk - not timing (however - timing does crop up, it just seems teh focus is significantly more on the type of risk involved).
*[Definition of 'Speculation'](
*The act of trading in an asset, or conducting a financial transaction, that has a significant risk of losing most or all of the initial outlay, in expectation of a substantial gain. With speculation, the risk of loss is more than offset by the possibility of a huge gain; otherwise, there would be very little motivation to speculate. While it is often confused with gambling, the key difference is that speculation is generally tantamount to taking a calculated risk and is not dependent on pure chance, whereas gambling depends on totally random outcomes or chance.*
*Investopedia Says*
*Investopedia explains 'Speculation'*
*It may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between speculation and investment, and whether an activity qualifies as speculative or investing depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset, the expected duration of the holding period, and the amount of leverage.*
*For example, while acquiring an additional property (in addition to one's principal residence) with the intention of renting it out would qualify as a bona fide investing activity, buying half a dozen condominiums with minimal down payments for the purpose of "condo-flipping" would undoubtedly be regarded as speculation.*
*Speculation has its benefits in a free economy. By their willingness to assume the other side of the trade (for a price, of course), speculators provide market liquidity and narrow the bid-ask spread, enabling producers to hedge price risk. Speculative short-selling may also keep rampant bullishness in check and prevent the formation of asset price bubbles.*

Complex reactions sometimes need to consume significant resources to drive long benefit. If just one corrupt government falls and tens of millions of current and billions of future people have better lives because of technologies like this - it'd be worth it for this guy to become a billionaire selling these to assholes the whole world wide.
How about this - at the end of the month the guy bugs the phone back and repurposes for distribution to developing markets? I'm gonna message him. Good criticism.
Edit - thinking about the but back idea: dumb. What security conscious person would ever give the phone back? Too many chips inside that might accidentally save data. First point stands though! :)

There will be little no value changes on the coins based upon the new miners themselves. The total number of coins made won't change - supply will stay the same.
A psychological effect *might* occur though - with 'professional' miners being able to take over a larger portion of the coin minting these individuals might have different spending habits. Maybe they hold more - maybe they spend more - maybe they are exactly the same as before.
