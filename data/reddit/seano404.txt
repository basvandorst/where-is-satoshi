You can send Bitcoins from Gox to another exchange though right?

better to keep things how they are, too many subreddits means valuable info is spread over many different places

Very good point!

making a currency (not a good) illegal will not push up its price, but do the opposite. Demand for BTC will decrease, people will look for an alternative that the authorities have not yet caught on to, pushing its price down. Simple economics.

cocaine and bitcoin are not similar at all, like the above comment says, you're not making a good illegal, you're making a CURRENCY illegal. If you're unable use a currency it is consequently worthless.

Would someone with a bit more knowledge than myself be able to list the pros and cons of such a show? It doesn't mean Bitcoins are widely adopted yet, but they are being widely acknowledged.

Basically what I had been thinking (+ a lot more helpful info!).
 
People won't spend if the value keeps rising, which undermines the point that  bitcoin should be used as a currency to keep it going. I'm a great supporter of BTC but I'm just trying to think about it from both points of view.
I hate the term bubble, but yes as the value keeps rising, I can't help but feel it's not rising BASED on something concrete and solid (ok maybe that people are fed up with the banking system and want an alternative, etc etc). 
But it's mainly just rising in value because of this weird hysteria, and with the value rising so rapidly, it's stifling the opportunity for it to actually be used as a currency, because like you said, people are spending BTC less and less as it pays more to hold on to your BTC at the moment.

yes if you eliminate those two countries from the equation you are eliminating two of the biggest supporters of the currency. Assuming you live in one of those 2 countries you're going to be in a tough situation if such a law gets passed.

ok - but what if you've got btc and you want to transfer them back to $/£/€ into your bank account. When people are filing tax returns and so on, people are going to start asking questions when you've got sums of money entering your account from an illegal source. 
I understand at the moment it's not particularly something that needs to be worried about, but i'm trying to get people thinking about the worst case scenario.
