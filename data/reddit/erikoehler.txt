Can't find that wallet for ios, but plan on using a native wallet next time. Was trying to (and it wasn't tough) approach it from a mainstream perspective. First timers are going to use circle/coinbase/whichever wallet they bought/delivered their first btc to.

lol yeah..I don't
Though the title is negative, I love the hell out of bitcoin (and am still buying/holding what I can). It just realistically set my expectations of using it in my daily life back a bit. And, if anything, made me optimistic that this is still in the very VERY early adoption phase. Watching this all unfold from my very rural home over the past few years, and using it so easily online, I had just built up an unrealistic expectation of how easy it would be to use face to face in one of the biggest cities in the world.

My ballsack was short on time and I didn't have a reason to try most of the coinmap locations (many were for services I didn't need. I always need food, so will be trying some more places on my next trip)
As for the "most basic of functions", I understand them very well. That wasn't the point. The point was to try using the 2 biggest wallets to complete a very simple person to person transaction. And it didn't work. 3 times. Once not the wallets fault, and twice IN THE BITCOIN CENTER. That was the best part.
Ty for the breadwallet suggestion. Will try it!

yeah, I plan on it for the next time. Any stories of success with any in particular?

I agree it is the least exciting, yet it's the primary function (at this moment) and the industry it's most trying to gain adoption in.
