Bandwidth at home can be an issue.
Home connections typically have very poor upload speeds. Full nodes push out far more data than they pull in.
A node downloading 20-30GB per month now, could be sending out 100-150GB.
That's now.
By 2036, we are talking TBs of data.
Not saying that we won't have the capabilities to handle that amount of data. Just pointing out upload bandwidth is sometimes more important to consider than download capacity.

I've been sitting on the fence a bit trying to figure out what's what. 
Having deployed a payment service intended for mass use inside one of the top 3 global retailers, you do need to plan ahead for optimistic outcomes and always keep the end users experience with your product in your sights. 
I have come to the conclusion that while you don't need to update now, or possibly not for another year, the sooner you do it the less of an impact it will be for new adopters.
What is being discussed here is that we should wait until Bitcoin becomes more popular before making a hard fork. That's precisely the wrong time to do it. 
Do it in anticipation of more transactions so that people coming to Bitcoin won't be reading news stories about a major upgrade that might cause problems. 
We also have to consider that nearly $1bn in VC money is going in to development. That investment will soon see new services pouring out and those firms will all have promotional money. The last thing they would want is to start a promotional push, and then face the same situation of having to tell their users that a major update is needed and the update carries some risks. 
I think that a hard fork should be made in line with BIP100. The hard fork should carry 1mb blocks as a starting point, but with some dynamic scaling options using just in time delivery to enable soft forking for increasing blocks sizes when capacity increases are required. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:30:02
You need to bake in a way to test or allow for costs and miner's incentives.
That needs to take into account reward halving, too.
That'll be interesting to see simulated, but I'm not sure its realistically possible. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:29:25
Hard fork to 1mb, but with an ability to raise the block sizes thereafter with soft forks referenced to moving average of transaction volumes and block wait times for average transactions.
1mb can go to 2mb by ~ Spring 2016 and should potentially stay there until 2017/18.
Introduce changes in the hard fork that will be needed for side chains and lightning networks (I guess that's partly what this is about).
If side chains and lightning work, the block sizes won't need to go above 2mb, but if there are delays or they don't work, the soft forks are there for an increase as the network requires them.

Scheduling hard forks about a week or so before Christmas can be dangerous. 
It's a busy time of year for shoppers, end of year for many businesses, end of school / college terms, etc. 
Bitcoin merchants would be expected to busy at this point taking online orders, etc.
Christmas crunch times don't impact every country, but it can impact some of the biggest demographics such as North America, South America and Europe.
January is usually a good time because people pack so much into pre end of year workloads. Between the second week in January and the last week of January might be worth thinking about doing a hard fork and using the Christmas holiday period, between Christmas and New Year's eve, to give people a chance to read up and prepare. 
As a global system of awesomeness, you will never be able to please all of the people, all of the time.

Is there something that gives an indication on the economics of sidechains? 
That could be an open ended question, but some examples would help.
I'm guessing transaction fees for conducting some activities.
Also, since I first read about sidechains last year, one of my biggest concerns was around the legal technical interpretation of a move from one chain to another - moving from one entity to another could be considered a "disposal event" by tax authorities which might kill the economics of any sidechain activity. 
I have some thoughts on how these technical challenges could be positioned, but there is a risk there, IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:44:20
BIP 102 should include the best of previous BIPs. A neutral group, if there is such a thing, can vote on what to include in BIP 102. People with strong positions can then make the case for any aspects that they would like to see go in or taken out. 
Even if BIP 102 just includes dates for a hard fork to give the options for changes in the future via soft forks, that might help make the hard fork happen as soon as possible. 
I'm not keen on the idea of 8mb doubling every 2 years based on miners agreeing - this is because the recent announcement that 5 pools accounting for 60% of the network's hashing said they would support 8mb blocks and wouldn't support XT fork.  
This is cartel behavior, not by miners but by representatives of miners. A small group overriding the voting power of the many is sort of old school control Bitcoin was introduced to circumvent. 
I'd rather see block sizes continually approach max limits and then having soft forks to create more headroom for another x number of years. 
It would be interesting to get the input from economists on supply / demand dynamics as this is partly an economic argument. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:53:31
5 Pools control the network?
That's probably a good reason to increase the blocks to 20mb to reduce the concentration of some of these large pools and get the network back to individual miners.

@_date: 2015-08-02 21:04:10
I was actually thinking along similar lines today.
Electricity in China is heavily subsidized, so the Chinese government is making it possible for miners in China to compete unfairly with others. 
Many of the Western hobby / garage miners have been priced out of mining because of cheap Chinese coal and cheap funding for small hydro plants. 
Increasing blocks and causing orphans in China might level that playing field for those with good bandwidth, but higher costs of mining.
The current problem with China is that they know where all the miners and pools are. If they wanted, they could co-ordinate a mass switch-off of Bitcoin mining and have a couple of State owned farms ready to take over. 
Unlikely, but you can never tell what the Communist Party are going to do next.

I think the concept of Bitcoin interacting with sidechains will open up a whole new area of tax law. Sure it can be based off existing laws, but it will be interesting to see existing laws evolve and loopholes exploited for a while.  
If you read what the Blockstream company and the developers are looking to connect through sidechains, they are looking at mostly contracts, but there are so many different applications that you can't give a fixed view or second guess the likely outcomes.  
Details of ideas for sidechain uses are here:
"Users can issue their own assets which represent fungible ownership of the underlying asset type representing by the newly created units, which could theoretically represent any asset including vouchers, coupons, currencies, deposits, bonds, shares, etc (subject to the respective jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements."
I think the sidechains component will have a few issues that will need to be considered when you first start to look at the nature of a transaction. For example:
1. Are you moving Bitcoins to a peg so you can do something else without interacting with a second person? e.g., I want to move some Bitcoins to a sidechain to carry out some coin mixing and then I want to go back to Bitcoin.  That's essentially a service for which I may have to pay a service fee, but I still want to have Bitcoins at the end of the process.
This can't be a disposal event. But I might have to pay VAT or a sales tax for the service element.
2. I want to send Bitcoin to a pegged exit point in order to buy some shares. So, when does the share purchase happen? When I send coins to an exit point, after which I obtain some token from which I then buy shares? Or when I buy the shares with the new token? Or are there two tax points, the exit from Bitcoin to a token and then the purchase of the shares?
3. What if I use sidechains to enter into contracts which are considered complete the moment I send Bitcoins to a sidechain peg? The transaction might take place immediately, or it could be locked until a future agreed date or event.  
So this is down to the nature of contracts. All contracts have to have consideration for them to be valid. Is my sending of Bitcoins to be locked as part of a contract a disposal event? I doubt it. It's a regular contract. It may create a tax point for capital gains tax, or sales tax or stamp duties, but contracts do not always create disposal events.
The developers certainly need to consider some of these issues for each type of sidechain, but I think they are focused on the technology at the moment. Which I can fully understand. 
I don't think that answered your question; but I hope it raised some points for consideration. I'm certainly spending time thinking about this area.

I think the issue is a little more subtle. Blockstream needs Bitcoin to succeed. If I were in their shoes, I would ensure the mother ship was in a good place, then build a business around it. Without Bitcoin, Blockstream has to think of another area to work in, pretty damn fast. 
The main issue on ethical development contributions, IMO, is giving priority to developments that are more aligned with Blockstream's future success. I wouldn't necessarily say this was a good or a bad thing for Bitcoin, just something worth noting when looking at the motivations for development and indeed supporting or not supporting other proposals or work. Their contributions should be welcomed, but considered on a case-by-case basis on the overall motivations - which is normal BIP procedure.

Actually, the heat generated by the chips could be channeled through to create electricity. That way you could potentially do away with cooling systems. This is sort of how a turbo on a car works, exhaust gases used to boost the engine. 
The trouble with this approach, however, is the likely cost of developing some form of heat recovery-back-to-electricity system. 
**tl;dr** yes, you can in theory use the heat produced by miners as part of a heat recovery system. it would increase efficiency and save on cooling costs.
