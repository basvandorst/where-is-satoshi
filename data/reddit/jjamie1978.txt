Thanks for all the offers!
But I'm not going to go first, I would have no protection if I did that, with PayPal you have chargeback as protection.

How many are you interested in?

Yeah he must be since he wants me just to send all 12 bitcoins to him first, lol what have you been smoking mate? There's no way on earth I would send 12 bitcoins first, why would I do that when PayPal protects the buyer since you can send the money as a service to me, which is refundable. Just give me your bitcoin address and I will send you all 12 bitcoins now, lol you must be sniffing glue mate.

What does account age matter? And PayPal is the safest way for the buyer. Let me guess you're an upstanding senior member who uses WU with no escrow lol!! Account age, feedback, etc means jack shit.

I'm looking into that site now, how does it work? Sorry for the noob questions, but how do I sell something on that site? And is it safe?

Had a couple of interested people so far, however no one has gone through with this transaction yet. I am still open to offers, however I won't go first as like I say I would be a moron to go first. You don't need to be worried about getting scammed as you can send the money as a service on PayPal which means you can get a refund. PM me with offers, thanks.

I'm willing to take that risk, I need the money too badly at the moment.

Yeah it looks really legit mate, NOT! 
Legit according to you, not exactly a popular site is it? Nice bit of adverting their mate.
And you offer WU or some shit like that? 100% Scam!
Reputation means jack shit. People on this site just use multiple accounts to make themselves look legit, I'm sure in a minute you will have one of your multiple accounts come and back you up.
Anyway stop hijacking this post, start your own post if you want to advertise your site.
