Is that a knock-off of the Merriam-Webster dictionary?

Why not?
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:18:39
Okay, like, "median class"?  What do *you* define as middle class?  Because median income sounds like a pretty good approximation.

See, my wife doesn't believe me when I say I'm just driving the economy.

Ooh, casual racism.  Haven't seen that one since @_date: 2018-01-25 05:31:02
Meh, more and more people are talking about the Smith and Wesson retirement plan.
Sure beats the hell out of a $5000/month nursing home!

They show up in books.
Y'know, those things with paper and a bunch of ink in them?

Wouldn't say hardcore, but left-libertarian here.

Ugh, yeah, it'll probably have crashed by then, all the way down to $100k or so.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:30:39
Guess we'll see!  I have a net negative into my crypto holdings at this point, so I don't particularly care one way or other.  Fun to watch, though.

Holy shit, it's almost like some of us have lives that don't consist entirely of hitting Refresh on reddit.

What's an Alt account
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:03
4-percenter here.  I was at about 35% effective tax rate last year.  ~8% state rate doesn't help.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:04:23
No more or less affordable than Bitcoin, except transaction fees seem to be far lower.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:02
Ooh, a 3 month old reddit account claiming that wealth and income are the same!
Go sit at the kids table.  Adults are talking.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:14:03
That's my thought too.  Plus or minus 50k.

Seems perfectly cromulent - an interpretation made by an intern ;)

You can live like a king on $40k/yr, just perhaps not in the US.
More and more folks are retiring early out of country.

Fuck Paul Ryan though.

That's nice over there.
Here in the good ol US of A, the right wing is hellbent on reducing and/or eliminating Medicare and Social Security (and has taken steps toward doing so).  So the left wing talks about improving social safety nets, the right wing actively destroys them.

No, because it's demonstrable that the 1% will not voluntarily donate the percentage of their income that we need to do the work that needs to be done.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:27:58
Fruits of what labor?  You seem to be operating under the pretense that the 1% (or especially the 1% of the 1%) does anything near earning their income.  Fact is, that's just not the case - in many cases they're making their income at the very expense of the working and lower classes.  Take a few minutes and learn the real reasons why Toys 'R' Us is going out of business.  Mitt Romney's company gutted them for a quick payout - bought a profitable chain, loaded it with debt, and bankrupted it.  It's called a "leveraged buyout".  That act of paperwork and banking is gonna put over 30,000 hard working Americans out of a job.  Why should we condone that?  Further, what "labor" was involved in gutting that company?  It's just using money leveraged against other money to make obscene amounts of money.
I guess if you think that's an okay state of affairs, that the working class is financially raped for the benefit of the wealthy few, we really don't have much to talk about.  If you think maybe that's just a little wrong, then great - we can talk about what should be done to fix it.  I say redistribution (well, so do a lot of economists, but they're not here to defend themselves).  You say something else (maybe).

Hey there.
I used to think like that too.
It's hard to hear for the first time (was for me too) but truthfully, honestly, there are people who need the excess money that the 1% has, more than the 1% needs that excess money.  The bottom 20% need a safety net, and it's the moral responsibility of a civilized society to provide it, at the expense of those who have benefitted the most from said civilized society.

1) Most of the wealthy people I know are totally unassuming.  They drive older, practical cars (think Accords and Camrys)  
2) Who says he has Bitcoin anymore?  
3) Who says he's wealthy? See

Look, I'd love to be wrong.  But virtually every decision he makes can be shown by decades of research, science, and/or economic theory to be inadvisable at best and suicidal at worst.

Check your 401k.  Stock market is now flat (or less) for the year as tariffs and bad economic policy come home to roost, and the sugar high caused by massive buybacks wears off.

Yes, duh.  Cheeto Tweeto is singlehandedly wrecking the US's financial outlook, and when the US sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.

The problem with playing chess with a pigeon is that it'll knock the pieces over, take a crap on the board, and fly back to its flock to claim victory.
Can't have a rational debate with a Trumpist, I'm afraid.
