Those were real problems. Not ordering a pizza because no one wants to break a twenty is not a problem. It's retarded. 
Bitcoin is valuable in certain instances. Claiming it as a solution to a bunch of mouth breathers who would rather go hungry than coordinate a pizza delivery is not very convincing.

 &gt;Garbage.  Yesterday i was in the lunch room, three people wanted to split a pizza. They each had $20s, and no one had change. 




Lol. That's not money's fault. Thats you and your coworkers fault for being  retarded.

Only accredited investors are allowed to invest in hedge funds. But realistically, you don't need a hedge fund to invest in bitcoin. Investing in a hedge fund only makes sense in the context of diversification across a broad range of nontraditional investments like timber or farmland. Why pay 2/20 when you can do it yourself for free.

Capital gains taxes for an investment held longer than one year are 15%. This wouldn't be considered income tax. Capital gains for less than one year holding period is higher.

Go to a financial advisor. They can tell you exactly what amount to withdraw now and invest to retire comfortably. Keep the rest in btc. Don't get greedy. The price of btc will not go up forever, it can gain widespread adoption and still tank. You have a life changing amount of value right now. Don't jeopardize that by assuming you can be a millionaire if you just hold on. Maybe that's the case, but maybe it's not. Would you rather be the guy who has 150k in the bank or the guy who HAD 150k in the bank. 
Its your money, so do what you think is best. But try and understand your options.

Yeah, that's a pretty amateur attempt at stock picking. Picking the dow losers has been priced into the market for decades.
