It's been 2 days... I see no reason to call it a "cover up" yet. There needs to be a full investigation so he can actually say what happened. These things aren't always immediately obvious. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:45:25
Maybe I'm missing something, but this doesn't increase my understanding of why private blockchains are a thing. 
The reason bitcoin works is because miners are incentivized to run the network but the payouts are random, so mining cannot be gamed. The reason the blockchain is incorruptible is because miners will always mine the longest chain, and their ability to create wealth for themselves is equivalent to their investment in the success of the system. Bitcoin cannot be undermined because to attempt to undermine it is to become invested in it, which human rational self-interest would dictate is sufficient to prevent malicious behavior.
The reason all other known systems can be undermined is because they all have central points of failure or other security flaws (e.g. nothing-at-stake as in PoS) which can be exploited given a determined adversary. Blockchains secured with proof-of-work are thus the only currently known way to run a decentralized system which *absolutely must not be undermined*, no matter how much trust is placed in that system. The more trust that is placed in a system, the higher the incentive to undermine it for personal gain. This is the basis of political corruption. 
So, if your system doesn't need a guarantee of *no security flaws* regardless of the amount of trust placed in it, then you don't need a blockchain; just use a database. If it *is* trusted enough, then you *must* use a blockchain secured by proof-of-work (or some currently unknown equally secure consensus algorithm); otherwise, once enough trust is placed in the system, *any possible security flaw, no matter how trivial*, will be exploited, and the system will fall apart.

Right, so this creates an incentive for 3 out of 10 banks to collude to undermine the system. Or it creates an incentive for a malicious party to hack 3 out of 10 banks and take control of their nodes. Still a security flaw. 


I thought you said 7 out of 10 need to be secure. And again, what if participants collude to undermine the system? 


Why are we assuming that they won't, or that they won't be hacked? 


Not really. If the system is down for a couple of hours, that would not destroy it. It would take days or weeks to completely destroy confidence in bitcoin. And then people would simply move their money into the next most promising cryptocurrency and try again. Anyone whose power is threatened by bitcoin  needs to destroy bitcoin *and all future cryptocurrencies* in order to succeed in profiting from an attack. This is obviously impossible. 


None of which seem adequate to me. Peercoin's solution is obviously unworkable, as having the developer sign off on checkpoints introduces a central point of failure. Nxt and Ethereum have problems, as noted in the article. Hybrid algorithms obviously rely on proof-of-work. Hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-burn seems to be the only algorithm the article doesn't have a problem with, and doesn't involve proof-of-work, but at the end of that section, it seems to say that all proof-of-stake is insecure, but some people think it might not be. That doesn't really inspire confidence. What inspires confidence is proof-of-work, given that it has sustained bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, through over 7 years of constant attacks. 


Once bitcoin is sufficiently popular, it becomes a much better strategy to simply embrace bitcoin as part of their business model than to try and destroy it. 


What are these organizational reasons?

Bitcoin is anonymous when used properly. Fiat money is not. Which is why buying bitcoin with fiat money is so heavily regulated. This is a problem with fiat money, not with bitcoin. Once you have bitcoin, your payments are fairly private. It's only the process of converting government currencies to bitcoin that is invasive.

Get a wallet whose private keys you control.  Buy bitcoins from Coinbase if you don't care about privacy, or LocalBitcoins or an ATM if you do.  Buy a fixed amount of dollars worth of bitcoin on a periodic basis (dollar-cost averaging) and transfer them into your wallet.  If you accrue a large amount of bitcoin, get a hardware wallet, or learn how to make a paper wallet.  Managing your own private keys is serious business.  There are endless ways for people to steal them, especially if you access them from an internet-connected device.  Make sure you understand what these ways are, and be careful to guard against them.

Neither of those fixes bitcoin's scaling problems; they just increase the forces causing bitcoin to centralize because they increase the cost of running a full node. Yes, these measures would increase the throughput of the network, but at what cost? In order to scale bitcoin, we must *decrease* the cost of running a full node, otherwise it becomes increasingly centralized as more and more nodes drop off the network. Bitcoin's decentralization must be preserved at all costs, as its value comes from the promise that the data in the blockchain is eternal, a promise which is only good so long as no one entity gains control of the network.  So if fees need to rise in order to preserve this decentralization, I say so be it. People who are already using bitcoin aren't going to stop using it because the fees are 10 cents instead of 5. In fact, the higher the fees, the more valuable bitcoin must be, because that means people are willing to pay more in order to use it. People can use litecoin for coffees until the lighting network gets traction. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:12:10


This is a less harmful form of decentralization than reducing the size of the p2p network, as once the number of nodes drops to a certain level, there is no recovering.  In contrast, the lightning network is being built *on top* of the bitcoin blockchain, so it doesn't matter how centralized the LN gets.
My point is that it's safe to build centralized services on top of a decentralized one, as the trust is ultimately placed sustainably, whereas if the *foundation* becomes centralized, there's no return from that situation.
@_date: 2016-08-25 03:04:04


Okay, and while this makes the system *somewhat* secure, it's still a security flaw that provides an incentive for someone to create at least that many dishonest nodes.  Again, given enough trust placed in the system, someone will exploit that weakness.


If you don't care about anonymity, but want a BFT system, you can just use one of BFT consensus protocols.
Anonymity is vital to the security of any such high-trust system. Otherwise state (or otherwise criminal) actors become in charge of it by default, given that they can threaten to kill people's families when the participants don't do what they want.  Therefore, any system where the participants must be identified can be undermined, given a high level of trust in that system.


But the price of electricity is always nontrivial.


Really?  Let's see it, then.


Really?  Then Wikipedia's [article on the matter]( would seem to be years out of date.  Perhaps you can update it?


That makes no sense.  If PayPal buys $1B worth of hardware to mine bitcoin (and commits the electrical resources to power said hardware), they're going to just mine bitcoin, as they will get way more profit that way, especially if bitcoin's price keeps breaking through its previous all-time highs.  Bitcoin's been running for 7 1/2 years now.  Don't you think someone would have tried this by now if it were true?

Yes, but my concern is the long term. I don't care if bitcoin's fees go slightly higher in the short term. Usage will obviously not be affected, because higher fees mean that more people are using bitcoin. This situation is highly preferable to a permanent ratcheting down of the number of full nodes. I say "ratcheting down" because it seems to me that as time goes on and the blockchain gets larger and larger in relation to personal computing technology, it will become more and more difficult to keep nodes from dropping off the network. The blockchain keeps growing bigger regardless of what devs do. But the tech won't scale any better unless the devs actively solve the issues with scaling now. Basically my position is that it's not pressing to solve the adoption problem right now, because that will be mitigated by fees. The scaling problem can only be solved with more core development. 




No one's forcing anyone to use the lighting network. And if the lighting network becomes centralized, who cares? You can still pay the fee and get on the real blockchain. Fees are tiny now. Even with a 100x increase in demand (which, by the way, won't happen if most transactions are occurring over the LN), fees will still be just $2, which will be fine for transactions above $20, depending on what your alternatives are. And if you absolutely just *have* to buy that coffee with a decentralized, trustless currency, you can use litecoin, which has 4x the throughput of bitcoin. It's fine if litecoin becomes centralized as long as bitcoin remains decentralized. There only needs to be one totally trustless currency.

Information security must be decentralized if power is to be decentralized. People need to understand this stuff; otherwise they're always trusting someone else. You can always put your money in lots of different places if you're unsure of the security of a particular setup. So, if you don't trust a particular payment channel, don't put a ton of money into it. In your scenario, it's Alice's fault because she doesn't understand how to secure her private key *and* she puts a large amount of coins into the channel.

But it has no employees, and instead of a governing board, it simply has a self-executing contract between all of these stakeholders, which can only be changed by a consensus of the aforementioned stakeholders.

Not at all. All hosted wallets are essentially bitcoin banks. Hosted wallets with lending services are practically no different from banks now. The difference is that, since bitcoin is untraceable, increasing levels of regulation have no effect on the likelihood of suddenly losing all the coins. So, these highly trusted, centralized bitcoin banks should eventually give way to more transparent models each time people get Goxxed, since the only way to prevent Goxxings is more transparency. This process could take a long time though, so I imagine that fairly soon you'll start to see actual licensed banks that offer bitcoin accounts.

Yes, and as long as we keep *on chain* transactions uncensorable, by keeping the network as decentralized as possible, we avoid centralization.


Again, absolutely none of this matters as long as regular bitcoin transactions are possible, which they always will be as long as bitcoin's blockchain and decentralized node network are still around.  Use the lightning network for things that you would normally use VISA for, which is the vast majority of everything.  You can't be claiming that the lightning network will be worse than VISA.  Use the bitcoin blockchain in the cases where you need an independent currency, and pay a premium for the privilege.  I see no problem with this.


The system cannot get "congested".  It can only become slower and more expensive.  This may price out some current use cases, to be sure, but that won't bring the system down.  People will just have to be more selective with what they use the blockchain for.
The results of your analysis don't strike me as a calamity.


I agree that multiple solutions should be worked on, and they *are* being worked on.  There will most likely be a hard fork to 2MB sometime in the next year or two.  Segwit, sidechains, LN, Schnorr signatures, etc are all in the works.

Um, no.  Ever heard of the black market?  The government is not all-powerful.  Declaring things illegal does not make them go away.  Your XKCD reference is not relevant here.  Yes, it's possible for the government to target a few economically important nodes.  No, it's absolutely *not* possible for them to target *all* nodes.
Also, it would make no sense for the governments of the world to ban bitcoin, just like it wouldn't make any sense for them to ban the internet.  Yes, they're disruptive, but they're just so damn useful.
@_date: 2016-04-17 05:15:38
No one would invest in it because it would be a terrible long-term store of value.

MySpace *wasn't* a "sub-par product", at least for a while when everyone was using it. It only became sub-par over time as their development team was increasingly unable to keep up with all of the obnoxious new uses of their platform. Closed source projects will practically always eventually diverge from what the market demands. Open source projects, on the other hand, become *precisely* what the market demands, as they are written by the users. 
Thus, open source projects, *when they fill a market need*, will always succeed in the long run. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:58:40
If it's filling a market demand, then yes.

He's definitely [rumored]( to be working on the project, and the project is supposedly built around decentralization, so there should be some bitcoiners among them.

@_date: 2016-08-06 02:24:12
That's not true at all.  If the only option was buy and hold, there'd be way less *volatility*, not way less demand.
My point is that you should always factor in the risk of the exchange being hacked or otherwise losing your coins.  It is naive not to consider this possibility, considering historical events.

Right, and it never will, for the same reason.  Open source projects can't fail.  They can become abandoned, but only if something that fills the same niche *better* comes along.  Which is unlikely for an open source project because anyone who wants to improve it can simply contribute to it.

No. The idea is that if a particular price is being sustained despite ~3600 new coins being dumped on the market daily, then the price should start going up if there are suddenly only ~1800 new coins on the market every day.

The point of RSK is so that bitcoin *doesn't* have to directly implement turing-complete smart contracts.  The only difference between RSK and Ethereum in terms of limitations is that RSK uses bitcoin as its currency, and Ethereum uses ether.

How so? 


The bitcoin protocol *is* a contract. 


Then who are all these people paying transaction fees to send money around? 


Yes, I'm playing with the definition of "company", but I haven't changed the definition of "investor", "contractor", "customer", or "employee". I think it only takes a slight stretch of the imagination to see how bitcoin is the next step in the evolution of the corporation.

I don't understand what you're saying here. If on-chain transactions are cheap, there will be no need to use the lighting network. If the lightning network becomes centralized, this will only matter if the lighting network is heavily utilized. If the lighting network is heavily utilized, this means that very few transactions are happening on-chain, which means that on-chain transactions are likely very cheap. The only reason people will use the lighting network is if fees or confirmation times are too high for their specific use case, which will be transactions like coffees which are low value but need quick confirmation. Transactions that need to occur on-chain will incur a $2 fee and take a few blocks to confirm, at *100x* current demand levels, meaning that if you can wait an hour for your transaction to settle and/or its value is greater than $20, you're probably still going to use bitcoin. 


Okay, so *again*, don't use the lighting network for illegal transactions. Just use *the regular bitcoin blockchain*. 


I think my reasoning is pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll let others be the judge.
Centralization on the lightning network is not a hazard. At *worst* it makes bitcoin significantly better than VISA, and at best makes VISA totally obsolete. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 01:52:44

I've never been scammed, and I never will.  It's not magic.  Just don't send your coins to someone you don't trust if you ever expect to see them again.


I prefer not to have to handle cash, in addition to not needing a bank account.


No.  The Shift card works anywhere VISA is accepted.  The location restriction doesn't prevent you from *using* the card anywhere, it only restricts you from *signing up for the card* from somewhere other than those 37 states.

Yep!  As soon as it became possible to exchange bitcoins for real-world things, this guaranteed that the value of bitcoin would always increase over time, which guaranteed that the ledger would stay secure longer, which guaranteed that the price would always increase over time, etc.  It's a virtuous cycle with no conceivable end, except for the case where some other cryptocurrency somehow becomes more valuable, which seems impossible given that a given cryptocurrency's *age* is a major component of its value.

@_date: 2016-04-03 07:54:10
I really can't understand the logic that the price will somehow go *down*. It seems to me that if miners are selling a certain amount of bitcoin every day and the price moves to the side, then if miners start selling half the original amount per day, the price should start to go up, not down.

Well, we can squabble over what "bitcoin account" means.  When I think of the word "account", I picture it being hosted like a "custodial account" (meaning that bitcoins are available on demand), while "bitcoin wallet" brings to mind holding the keys myself.  But that's just me, I guess.

The Tesla Model S is widely considered the best car ever made. Bitcoin has some hurdles to clear before it's the best money ever made. One of those hurdles is the size of the user network. The Model S isn't dependent on a large user network to be awesome. It just *is* awesome. Like bitcoin it should improve over time the more people invest in electric cars
The network will grow as the price increases, and the price will increase the longer bitcoin stays around. Its value is rooted in the promise that data in the blockchain is eternal. The longer this promise is not broken, the more valuable the currency securing that data becomes, as more trust is placed in the promise.

Ethereum's attack surface is objectively larger than bitcoin's. I'm just pointing out features of ethereum that make this true. I'm not judging you for investing in ethereum, I'm just saying that its attack surface is massive, which makes me uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:46:32

@_date: 2016-04-18 00:07:26
I see what you're saying, but again, that's debatable.  If you lend someone dollars, do you "have" those dollars?  It's the same thing with a demand account.  Yes, there are rare situations where the coins are not available on demand, but 99% of the time, they are.  I agree with you that it's not a good idea to hold a large amount of bitcoin in an exchange account.  But does that mean that the coins in the account aren't "mine"?  If the exchange runs away with the coins or freezes the account, should I not be angry?
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:40:23
They are if you know what you're doing. If blockchain transactions aren't private, where are the Gox coins? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:41:58


You don't need to store a large percentage.  Just keep some spending money in alts and then pay the fee once to sell some bitcoin.  The larger and less frequent these transactions, the less you pay in fees.
@_date: 2016-04-18 05:57:29
LOL 1000 bits
@_date: 2016-04-02 00:26:38
This is just an initial impression, but it sounds like the "contract" layer is being abstracted away from the validation layer.  If I'm correct, that means that the problem of storing absolutely every detail of every contract *in the blockchain* will no longer be necessary, effectively enabling smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain.
Am I off base with this conjecture?
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:02:55

- The exploding blockchain size is a danger to decentralization.
- Contracts can have bugs which lead to lost user funds, as in the case of the DAO and that of the Parity multisig bug.
- The switch to PoS will introduce a whole new, essentially untested security model.

LTC is good for bitcoin. That is why I'm "promoting" it. Layer 2 is not here yet.

Yes, the IMF has *influence* because they have a lot of power. But their power, like all power, is predicated upon their not abusing said power too much. They can certainly nudge the market this way or that, but if/when the market decides to exit fiat and move en masse into crypto, the IMF will lose face faster than it would be able to stop the exodus. 
So I misspoke; they have *some* say over what happens, but only insofar as what they say agrees with what the market wants. Which is to say, not very much.

Yes, obviously litecoin is an alt. I never said it wasn't. 


Uhh, what? You realize that Bcash's blocks are every ten minutes, while litecoin's are every 2.5 minutes, right? LTC is 4x faster than BCH, and the fees are negligible on both since their blocks aren't full. 


I find this claim dubious. Source? 


Sure, use some other alt instead, I don't care. It doesn't need to be LTC. My point is that BTC is no longer viable for small transactions, so we may as well start using something decentralized like another blockchain rather than centralized solutions like Coinbase. 
I personally like LTC because it has segwit, and thus will be viable for cross-chain atomic swaps with bitcoin once lightning goes live, making it especially useful as a "checking account".

I agree in theory, but totally removing that distinction implies that it's possible to have all payments settle instantly, which it currently isn't. I hope that *someday* bitcoin does achieve this, but until then, payment and settlement are, practically speaking, different things. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:24:56


Sounds like a fantastic idea for a decentralized business! Who wants to build it with me? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:09:04


Yes we do, and it will.  Eventually the number of people buying to get rich quick will far outnumber the people who believe in the long-term promise of the tech.  At that point, the value must collapse to less than half of its all-time high as these weak hands panic sell.
There is no way to prevent this situation from repeating forever until bitcoin is as big as the dominant fiat currencies.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:19:05
This is a really interesting question, and I'm not an expert, but I'll attempt to answer.
Your WIF private key is a large random number, and your defense against other people spending your coins is that it's (practically) impossible for people to guess this number.  The way private keys can be generated from a list of words is using hashing functions, which actually destroy information in going from input to output.  You propose some computational function that can convert a huge random number into a list of words, which we'll call "reverse bip39".  By definition of "secure hashing function", our "Reverse bip39" function cannot be a secure hashing function, as the act of creating the word list would require brute-forcing (trying all possible inputs to) the Reverse bip39 function. So if the hash function is secure, it would be impossible to use; and if it's *not* secure, then you'll need to keep it closed source to keep people from using your function to guess all possible inputs.
So, I guess I'm not saying that such a function is impossible, just that it needs to be kept secret.  There's still the problem that your word list (or the function you're running it through) will need to contain at least as much information (or "entropy") as the WIF key, since any easily brute-forceable function combined with an input needs to contain all of the information necessary to reconstruct the output.  So you'll most likely end up with a really long word list.  I think the easiest way to solve your problem is simply creating a story out of your private key (which of course is not an "easy mnemonic"). Taking the example WIF key from the [wiki](
"(5) Harry understands entropy.  Charles Gregory Underwood 8th reads...."
A more general solution to your problem could be converting the WIF key into all lowercase using base 32 or something, then inventing a cipher to convert the resulting string into words, perhaps adding a nonce and brute forcing, as in creating vanity addresses.
My favorite solution I've come up with off the top of my head is creating a word array of length 2^X, like 65536 (2^16), then converting the WIF key into a byte string as described in the wiki, then chopping up the resulting byte string into pieces of maximum value 2^16, then assigning each piece to a word in your array, using the value of the current piece to find the word at that position in your array.  Write down all the words in order, each word representing 4 characters in a 74-character byte string private key.  You'll obviously need some padding at the beginning or end, as 74 is not divisible by 4.  This will give you a word list of length 19.  Then, when you want to recreate your private key, just run the algorithm in reverse, looking up the index of each word, which will recreate your private key.  Just don't lose your word list :P
All of this is, of course, a pointless intellectual exercise, as it's much easier to use bip39 as intended, and simply use a word list as your input.  But I had fun taking a crack at it :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:10:16
Exactly what I'm saying. Bitcoin *promises* to eliminate the difference between the payment and the settlement, at least for some transactions, but we've still got a lot of work to do. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:48:11




Yes, fees are paid, but they are [30 BTC per day]( while coinbase rewards are ~3600 BTC per day. This is negligible.  Fees need to go *much* higher before they can even begin to replace the coinbase rewards.

This is because literally every other coin is being used less than bitcoin, with the exception of Ethereum, whose fees are starting to rise.


Right now, centralized companies like Coinbase are the scaling solution for bitcoin.  LN isn't "centralized", but even if it were, it would be better than what we have now.

I disagree. Scaling can be simply [increasing the capacity of a system](


Sounds like scaling to me. Also, segwit reduces the amount of data full nodes need to store. This also increases the capacity of the system. 
Also, segwit enables *other* features that *do* allow bitcoin to scale infinitely that would be ugly or impossible without it, like the Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures. This is all in the article.

Anyone sending at least $100, probably, and definitely anyone sending $1000 or more. Keep in mind that high value transactions are still a way better deal using bitcoin instead of legacy solutions, even with huge transaction fees. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:13:25
Yes, I think we both agree that bitcoin should be built with all types of transactions in mind. That is, it needs to be able to completely replace the legacy financial system over the next decade or two. I disagree with people who think bitcoin will be relegated to some niche in the legacy system. 
I don't know of anyone advocating for bitcoin being *only* a "settlement" network (though they may exist). I do know of people advocating for *emphasizing* security and decentralization over speed, and I agree with those people, because we can always make payments faster without waiting for core development by building layers on top of bitcoin; these layers will eventually become an integral part of the new crypto financial system, perhaps even being integrated into the core protocol. But the core developers need to focus on keeping bitcoin as decentralized as possible, because once we lose decentralization, we lose all progress and become PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:54
Yeah, I'm encouraged to read something like this... it means someone at the SEC is doing their homework!
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:17:18
This is impossible now that cryptocurrency technology is out of the bag. Any cryptocurrency that is sufficiently centralized will collapse due to competition from other, fairer cryptocurrencies. The optimal strategy for banks, therefore, is obviously buying up a huge amount of bitcoin and lending it out. I don't know why banks aren't doing this already. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:08:33
If you wanted it to clear faster, your fee was too low. 
And the legacy financial system would take 3 days, at least :) 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:41:07
The blockchain and the unit of account are not the same thing. It is pure fantasy to expect bitcoin's blockchain to be able to handle all transactions involving bitcoin the unit of account, while scaling to the size of VISA. We must accept that second-layer solutions will inevitably be needed for the vast majority of bitcoin transactions in order for the crypto financial system to be able to replace the legacy financial system. 
This doesn't "ruin" bitcoin in any way. Perfectly secure transactions can be performed by paying a premium and waiting an hour, while instant transactions can be performed cheaply, with a tiny risk of fraud. It's pretty unreasonable to expect more. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:14:33

Well, the Internet is pretty revolutionary, isn't it? :D


I assume you mean that bitcoin is being run by hundreds of people in hundreds of countries, and that's why it can't be shut down.


Forgive me, perhaps I've been away for too long, but isn't *this precise thing* what OpenBazaar was designed to fix, going back to its progenitor, DarkMarket?  Isn't the idea that you can run a node over Tor and thus be undetectable? Isn't the idea that OpenBazaar is essentially a decentralized Silk Road, hence with all the benefits and none of the detriments thereof?


Again, maybe I've been away too long, but I thought that only the owner can post items for sale on his/her own store?


Well, except, you can be anonymous on OB.  Isn't that the point?


How, by whom?


I do like Drop Zone.  At least, I like the idea of Drop Zone.  Never used it myself.


This is a technical shortcoming of OB, which I could have sworn they were trying to fix.  Again, perhaps I've been away for too long, but I thought the stores get hosted in the DHT, not necessarily requiring stores to be up all the time.  I thought they were at least working *towards* this functionality.


This *is* interesting, but what's keeping law enforcement from posting things on Drop Zone and stinging would-be buyers?  That was always my main beef with DZ, though it is a cool idea.


Last I checked, OB is an open-source protocol.  If it sucks, anyone can fork it and fix it.


You do seem to be able to write walls of text.  But I don't attribute that to more thought.  Just more talking.
As bitcoin (and bittorrent before it) has shown, any protocol that is *open-source* and *peer-to-peer* is potentially enhanceable by *anyone*.  This means that all of the problems with OpenBazaar (or bitcoin, or bittorrent), can potentially be fixed by *literally anyone*.  Yes, OB may have needed to downplay its "dark" origins when it received funding, but this is not to say that it won't one day revolutionize commerce, being that it is, again, open source and peer-to-peer.  There's no reason stores can't be hosted when you're offline, by the DHT.  There's no reason your connection can't be anonymized, by using the Tor network.  OpenBazaar is a bold experiment that may fizzle, or it may gain traction.  In my view it's unfair to judge such an open protocol before it's even launched.  
Again, I'm open to being proven incorrect by developments that have happened since I last forked and ran OB, over a year ago.  But even if OB has taken a turn for the censorable, the original code still exists and can be developed in whatever direction the market dictates.

Pretty much any catastrophe that befalls bitcoin can probably be mitigated in other coins.  Also, if bitcoin transactions become slow and high-cost, litecoin and dogecoin will most likely take up the slack on small, fast payments.

The problem with explaining bitcoin to most people is that the average person doesn't understand why the problems bitcoin solves are problems. For reference, it solves the problem of supply inflation, final settlement taking days (or weeks), merchants having to pay 2% or more on every transaction, friction in international payments, surveillance, censorship, and potentially fractional reserve banking. These problems are esoteric and/or invisible to the average person because either a) these problems are dealt with by parties other than the end user, or b) that's how things have always been.
It always makes me facepalm whenever people say, "but I get 1% cash back on all my credit card purchases!"....yeah, but trust me, you're repaying the cost of that 1% many times over in subtle ways. It's not magic.

@_date: 2015-12-16 18:47:01
Good point, but this is *way in the future*, when bitcoin has 100x more users than it has now. Demand for bitcoin is not being limited by transaction fees. We have only just started filling up blocks. There's no need to preemptively raise the block size. Just wait until fees start becoming a barrier to entry, and *then* raise it. This is not some kind of emergency. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 06:42:07
I agree that banks *as an institution* are threatened by bitcoin.  But only the large banks will be truly driving the fight against bitcoin to save this institution.  There are smaller, independent banks who stand to gain massively by buying into bitcoin early and becoming part of the ecosystem.

Most people don't need bitcoin, then.  They can keep using their credit cards with their rewards points and their savings accounts which slowly lose value.  It's no skin off my nose.


I agree with you, but we don't need the *bitcoin blockchain* to handle everyone's groceries.  Just be patient.  Second-layer solutions are coming.  There's really no reason at all to rush to *pre-emptively* blow the lid off the block size, and risk everything, just so that we can have 3 cent fees instead of 10 cent fees.  There's absolutely no reason bitcoin needs to be able to handle all global commerce within the next few years.  Give it 10 or 20.  I'll still be holding.
@_date: 2015-12-25 06:39:57
Sure, unless banks invent bitcoin IOUs the same as they did with gold (this is pretty much what the lightning network, or Ripple, or Stellar, does).  But even without that feature, it would still be hugely profitable for banks to a) buy up tons of bitcoin before it goes to the moon, and b) lend it out at interest.

Name one that has performed better than bitcoin over the past 6 years. The point is that the *maximum possible return* on traditional investments is something like 20% per year. Startups offer a potential upside of multiplying your money by 10x. But only if you invest *before* the company goes public. That's what I'm referring to. 


And the wonderful thing about bitcoin is that it will never *be* THE currency, because usage is voluntary; unlike fiat money, whose usage is mandatory. Thus, there will always be one or more competitors, because that's how a real free market works :). 
All I'm saying is that cryptocurrency opens up investments that the average joe never previously had; investments with a potential to crash to zero, but that could possibly multiply an investment by orders of magnitude over a relatively short period.

I'm not shilling alts.  With an average fee of ~$50 today, it doesn't make any sense to use bitcoin for transactions under maybe $250, where the fee would be 20%.  It's doing just fine for transactions bigger than that, though :)
I don't understand the thought process of people who want the bitcoin blockchain to be all things to all people.  Other blockchains are helping scale crypto while we build layer 2, and are thus good for bitcoin.

Transaction fees are hovering around [30 BTC]( per day, while coinbase rewards are ~3600 BTC per day.  Transaction fees are tiny compared to the coinbase rewards, and will stay that way until transaction volumes are two orders of magnitude larger.  An argument could be made that the current amount of hash power on the network is excessive, and that the halving will not affect network security.  Regardless, keeping transaction fees at 30 BTC per day while cutting the coinbase rewards from 3600 to 1800 is going to essentially cut in half the cost of an attack on the network.  This is a personal preference, but I'd much rather pay slightly higher fees and be patient for second-layer solutions while being secure in my knowledge that some three-letter agency isn't going to take down bitcoin, than blow the blocksize cap off and hope for the best.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:25:08

I'm not talking about accidental data corruption; I'm talking about intentional corruption, by someone who doesn't like the data.  *You* may not lose posts to social media, but there are plenty of people and organizations who do, because of censorship.  As an American company, Twitter is subject to the US government.  If I publish something that the US government doesn't like and post a hash of it to Twitter, the government can force Twitter to remove it, or worse, alter the timestamp.  Yes, I agree that for most applications, the Twitter checksum is probably sufficient.  But there are edge cases where you really want your data to be *actually* immutable, and not easily mutable at the whim of someone powerful.
I didn't realize this post was about Factom.  I agree that Factom has dubious value at this point, as you also would want the data itself hosted somewhere untouchable.  Hopefully things like IPFS, Storj, Maidsafe, etc will fill this gap.

This is a bit extreme, as most of the world hasn't heard of bitcoin, and doesn't *want* to own any bitcoin, which makes it significantly different from the dollar, which practically everyone in America wants to own.

All mining pools are hashing different data as the coinbase transaction's receiving address is unique to each pool. Since the coinbase transaction is included in the data that's being hashed, you don't need to worry that some other pool will increment the nonce faster than you can.

@_date: 2015-12-16 06:13:51
Enlightening castle story. 
I completely agree that bitcoin still serves a purpose even if transaction fees go to $1. That purpose is monetary sovereignty. Transaction fees absolutely need to go higher in order to offset the decline in coinbase reward. Other coins, sidechains, LN, etc, can handle people's coffees. The bitcoin blockchain cannot be and should not try to be all things to all people.

There are good investments and bad investments.  Pretty much all investments available to the average citizen are shitty investments, due to accreditation rules. The best investment for an average person, then, is either stocks, which do marginally better than inflation over the long term, or starting a business, which is hugely risky (and lots and lots of work), but at least the owner has some manner of control over the outcome.  Bitcoin changes this, by enabling companies to issue cryptosecurities instead of legacy ones.  By holding bitcoin, you're investing in bitcoin.  This is not, as you imply, harmful to society, or to bitcoin.  Bitcoin needs people to hold onto it so that its value continues to increase.  But there will come a time, eventually, when bitcoin's value is relatively stable over the long term.  At that time, it won't make any sense to let your coins gather dust, as there will be much better cryptosecurities to invest in, with much higher growth potential.  We haven't gotten there yet, though.

Maybe more of an ELI12, but here's what I got:
Just as bitcoin is revolutionizing the financial industry by decentralizing money, YouBase promises to revolutionize the data industry by putting data back into the hands of individuals.  Companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn have proven the success of mining people’s private data to drive better decisions, but they’ve done so in a way that keeps them in control and allows them to sell it to third parties, while blocking the individual himself from analyzing the data and reaching a better understanding of his own life.  Additionally, an enormous amount of very private but extremely valuable data, like medical and financial records, is lying around gathering dust because its release would compromise the security of the individuals it describes.
YouBase’s solution to these problems is to structure the data hierarchically, encrypt it, and put it somewhere public.  Then, using BIP32 HD wallets coupled with public/private key encryption, allow individuals to control third-party access to all levels of their own data, reserving “top secret” access just for those individuals or organizations that can be trusted with personally identifiable data, while sharing anonymized or insensitive data freely or for a low price.  Finally, use a completely decentralized storage network (IPFS is recommended) to host the data, so data persists forever but is uncensorable and unreadable by anyone not given explicit access.
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:25:07
Bitcoin will definitely not be around in its present state by the time this starts to matter. I think bitcoin will either be upgraded to a better hashing algorithm through sidechains or some other upgrade mechanism, or litecoin and company will become the dominant cryptocurrencies.

That may not have been your intention, but the perception that an idea emerged from someone on drugs tends to cheapen that idea in the public perception, leading to dismissal.

Transactions will not get stuck because wallet implementations will calculate the correct fee to get into the blockchain in the desired time limit. People needing fast confirmations, and people sending large amounts, will be willing to pay much higher fees. This is the most efficient use of resources. If it becomes hard to send bitcoin quickly, people will start using litecoin and dogecoin for the small transactions. Segregated witness will be deployed over the coming year, which should increase the effective capacity of the network, so there is no reason to expect that the above image will ever come to pass.

Ok, so there's one stock out of thousands that went up by 400x in 5 years.  Whoop-dee-do.  Only 13 stocks out of thousands (actually, how many total is this list out of?  I can only see the top 250) get you a return of 10x or more over 5 years.  Bitcoin, in contrast, [has gone from $0.25 5 years ago to ~$456]( an increase of over 1826x, or 182,600%.  Pretty much all of the top cryptocurrencies have similarly appreciated by percentages that are virtually unheard of in stocks.  Why?  Because generally, by the time a stock goes public, its massive growth phase is already over.  The average investor does not get a chance to invest in a stock before it goes public, and thus does not get to share in the massive gains experienced by "accredited" investors.

Jesus, CSW is even dumber than I thought. 
He really doesn't get how impossible it would be to generate such a long vanity address. You literally have to check every private key until it maps to your pattern. A 29-character vanity address would take, like, the rest of eternity to generate.
And he clearly doesn't realize that the last 4 characters are a checksum which make sending impossible if not correct.
This is worse than the time he screwed up trying to prove he was Satoshi. This clearly indicates that he has absolutely no experience coding with bitcoin addresses.

Bitcoin is not a public utility. It's destructive for a city to have an anti-growth strategy, because the city (often) has a monopoly on infrastructure improvements. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has healthy competition in the form of altcoins. If bitcoin becomes too expensive for people to use, *they will simply use a different cryptocurrency*.

Your view that OpenBazaar has "absolutely nothing to offer" is incredibly myopic.

So what if he *did* eat LSD? He's putting a huge idea (an increasingly interconnected world) into perspective by comparing it to something familiar -  biology. Knowledge is the ability to make consistently correct predictions about the future, and the only way to do this is to have an accurate model of the present. Sometimes having a simple analogy is the best way to achieve this.

True. I guess I sort of just always assume that when given the opportunity, strangers on the Internet will take advantage of any trust I place in them. Bitcoin is novel because it allows commerce between strangers without trust of any kind. The corollary to this is that if you lose money, you have only yourself to blame.

The "bitcoin is not anonymous" meme is so dumb. Bitcoin will evolve to become as anonymous as it needs to be in order to survive, with tech such as ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs. And even if the government somehow manages to find and jail everyone holding bitcoin (which is physically impossible), that will only add to the market cap of *even more private cryptocurrencies*, such as Dash and Monero. The government cannot possibly defeat cryptocurrency. The cat's out of the bag. The end of government-issued money is nigh.

No. is correct that there are two different definitions for inflation. The second definition is actually the more used one. (See the intro of

I actually think adoption drives trust. I think bitcoin's value approximately follows Metcalfe's law, going up with the square of the number of users. So its value does increase every time a business starts accepting bitcoin, because that's one more place I can spend. But what really drives the value up is when *people* start accepting bitcoin, because once I can settle debts in bitcoin, it becomes that much more of a good idea for me to hold some. People aren't going to start trusting bitcoin because they understand it; they're going to start trusting it once they've used it a few times and their friends are using it. Trust will come once everyone's using it... It worked with fiat, didn't it?

Right, but "imperfect models" do not help us predict black swans (as [Taleb]( calls them), which are highly improbable events which have a huge impact.  Trying to predict these events (the Great Depression, 2008 financial crisis, etc.), or trying to prevent them, is arguably the basis for having a field of economics in the first place.  Since these events keep happening, it's clear that either 1) economists have no idea what's going on, or 2) they do, but the big/central banks are causing the problems and spreading misinformation through economists.
The great thing about decentralized currencies is: now we'll get to do real, controlled economic experiments where we have access to all the data!  These are exciting times we live in.

The transaction volume of Bitcoin is on the order of $50M/day ( which comes to about $18B for a year. Since Bitcoin is a global currency, it makes sense to compare this figure to the total global transaction volume. In 2012, the gross world product was around $70T ( That puts the adoption level of Bitcoin at around 2.5 basis points, or 2.5 ten-thousandths of GWP.

Imagine the Internet in the 80s... A bunch of disjoint networks with their own rules and protocols. Now picture that one network implements TCP and starts the "modern" Internet... that's what sidechains are. I, like yourself, would like to eventually see all the crypto-assets together on one network, like an Internet of money, but sidechains are a prerequisite to that. We must have a way of transferring crypto-assets to other blockchains before we can start floating all of the crypto-assets around all of the blockchains. 
I realize this statement is very vague and forward-looking, but this "Internet of money" concept is the end goal I'm picturing and I believe sidechains are a step towards that vision.

Bitcoin doesn't need those things because it gets rid of the problems in the legacy financial system for which they are needed.  Deposit insurance is not needed if your bank isn't fractional reserve.  "Universally accepted payment infrastructure" - not sure what you mean here, but obviously Bitcoin has the potential to be far more universal than any fiat currency.  "Effective legal recourse in case of fraud" - Bitcoin is equal to cash in this regard.  Don't get your BTC stolen, just like you shouldn't get your cash stolen.

This is true because bitcoin expects people to prioritize their own interests rather than subordinating their own interests to those of the collective.

It's one of the things that will continue to threaten bitcoin's decentralization as it gets bigger.  So, yes.  However, the main issue is that blocks are filling up.  Segwit immediately gives us a 75% increase in the number of transactions that will fit in a block.

I think the appeal of having regulations specific to Bitcoin is it dispels some of the FUD associated with it... The bottom line is, no one can *actually* regulate Bitcoin, but it's possible for governments to be hostile enough that it makes it hard to convert fiat to BTC.  At least until Bitcoin becomes more widely used, it's nice to have an appearance of government acceptance because most of the population is afraid of breaking the law, and having a legal, government-sanctioned exchange in the US should expedite the process.

True. However, there are other, less regulated ways to acquire less than $400 worth of Bitcoin on a biweekly basis. If Coinbase wants to compete with these methods, they'll have to be a little more careful with which transactions they block.

The only reason fiat money has value is because people see it as the *only* system, and that system is prone to massive inflation (happening now with quantitative easing implemented by nearly all major central banks). People and businesses haven't stopped accepting fiat, however, because it's currently seen as the only system. Once people realize that decentralized currency is a thing (and they slowly are, bubble by bubble), and that Bitcoin is not prone to runaway inflation (or capital controls, or surveillance), people will begin to switch their assets from fiat to Bitcoin.  This will further drive the value of Bitcoin up and in the process, it will drive the value of fiat down. The only recourse to central banks will be to continue printing money like mad, or switch *their* assets to Bitcoin. Eventually no one will want to trade Bitcoin for fiat, putting its value at effectively zero. The transition from fiat to math-based currencies is one-way.

...how does that even remotely follow from what I said? 


What makes you say that? The bitcoin ecosystem produces plenty of goods and services. Just look at all the companies that accept it (Microsoft, Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Expedia, etc). Are you saying that these companies produce no goods or services? 


Again... what?! Are you saying that the employees of bitcoin companies who are paid in bitcoin do not constitute a labor force? 


Not sure why this is relevant; there are plenty of assets that "have no central government" that nevertheless have value. Look at oil and gold. Are you saying these assets have no value?


First of all, bitcoin has the best reputation of any currency I know, seeing as it has never been hacked or unexpectedly inflated. Second, you didn't include "reputation" in your reasons for why fiat has value, so I'm ignoring it. Obviously there are plenty of currencies that don't have "reputation" but still have value. 
What I'm getting at is that OP is correct in his observation that things only have value if people *think* they have value. The only reason people are fleeing the ruble for the dollar right now is because people think they'll be able to buy less stuff in the long run if they hold onto their rubles rather than exchanging them for dollars. 
Likewise with bitcoin. What gives bitcoin value is that *you can buy stuff with it*, because the people selling stuff for bitcoin think that *they'll be able to buy stuff with it*. Value is nothing more nor less than this.

The number is a 256-bit long binary number (which means 256 0s and 1s). So the highest possible value is 256 1s in a row, and the lowest possible value is 256 0s in a row. Computers always internally store all the leading zeros, even if the number is way less than the maximum value (which it pretty much always is, because 256 1s in a row, in binary, is about 10^77, or a 1 followed by 77 0s, in decimal).
Edit: the real maximum value of a 256-bit number, displayed as a decimal number, is: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935

Yes, I read that article, and it explains well why people will probably pull their money out of stocks and real estate. What I'm saying is that: 
1) these things will still have value, people will just have to be more careful with which stocks and which real estate they buy. I think that, in the near future, businesses will monetize by issuing reward points as cryptoequities and this will be the incentive for people to buy and hold. You'll need to be way more careful about which equities you invest in than currently, but it'll still be very profitable to pick the good ones early. Here's a reddit comment I wrote that touches on this: 
As for real estate, again, it'll still be profitable, just more difficult, to buy low and sell high. 
2) you say in your article


I take issue with how you phrased this. I don't think bitcoin will hurt "people"... Yes, speculators will lose their investments, and those *securities* will be hurt, but the *people* will be just fine; they'll simply move their money elsewhere.

I don't think so. Any bitcoins being traded for goods/services must be acquired at a market rate. So the balance of supply /demand will stay the same.

The idea that QE is not causing massive inflation is a little absurd.  in November 2008, when QE1 started, the Fed's balance sheet was "between $700B and $800B" (  In December of 2013, the balance sheet hit $4T ( and the bond buying continues.  The M1 money supply was around $1.5T in Oct. 2008 (when QE1 started) and is now about $2.8T (see   This doesn't count the M2 money supply and the M3 money supply, which the Fed conveniently stopped publishing in 2005.  How does the M1 money supply double, but inflation is only 2% per year?  Magic?  An increase of 2% over 5.5 years gives 11% total.  We had an 100% increase, and that's not counting M2 &amp; M3.

Maybe the "official" inflation rate is not correct?

Ideally there wouldn't be taxes (or a centralized national government) and any public services would be funded by non-profits taking donations, or for-profits taking in revenue from providing a useful service. This is because everything the government does can be done better and at a lower cost by the private sector, and the only reason it exists is to allow the 1% to maintain their control over everyone else. Imagine how much more peaceful the world would be if the government had to *ask the citizens for funding to go to war*. That is the future bitcoin promises.

You are contributing, I'm not sure what's with the downvotes.. I'm just responding to your opinion with mine. I agree that those are important aspects of Bitcoin history, but I think the OP wants to use his position in the media to introduce Bitcoin to people who may not know much about it. To that end, it seems counterproductive to go in too much detail about Bitcoin's shady past... That's been a significant blocker to mass adoption since the beginning, because people associate Bitcoin with criminals. In addition, the price volatility and speculation are kind of scary to someone trying to figure out if using Bitcoin is a good idea.
I guess my point is that if the OP is trying to promote Bitcoin, then he should leave out the negative stuff. If he's just trying to tell the story, then fine, leave in all the gory details, but don't expect people to want to use Bitcoin if that's how it ends up going.

I share your optimism for China in general, but not for its currency. The Chinese government has been more than willing to devalue the yuan whenever it suits them, so the yuan has the same fundamental problems the dollar has. 
I can see bitcoin becoming the reserve currency certainly within a generation or two, and by then the problems with fiat currencies fixed by cryptocurrencies will be commonly known, so there won't be any reason for people to own fiat, at least not as a store of value.

What you are describing is indeed a real phenomenon, but you must understand that it's because of fiat money.

Ugh, another "bitcoin the currency's dumb, but we love the blockchain idea!" article. When are people going to realize that you cannot have one without the other? If we give Janet Yellen the private keys to magically create more "bitdollars", that undermines the trustlessness of the whole system, because it assumes that the Federal Reserve won't unexpectedly inflate the currency, and it assumes that no one will hack the Fed. The beauty of bitcoin is that it eliminates trust in everything except logic.

Communication is key, and this post is much appreciated. Bitcoiners are a paranoid bunch, and this subreddit is useful for outing scams. If you take sole control over a large amount of money, and then don't really talk about what you're doing and why, this reaction is hardly surprising. I did not donate and I'm sure that whatever you're paying 4 developers $125/hr each for a year to build is going to be fantastic.

This has nothing to do with whether altcoins will succeed in the long run.  Just because Bitcoin currently has the network advantage doesn't mean that sometime down the road, some other currency won't replace it.  In fact, reserve currencies tend to last only about a hundred years before the "developing money economy" cycle starts again.  See 
Furthermore, given that innovation in payments is accelerating now that we have the Internet, I consider it doubtful that Bitcoin will last anywhere near 100 years.

You're distracting from the fact that *practically no one* saw the crisis coming.  Yes, science does not control policy, but it should inform it.  This isn't climate change, where 98% of the scientific community is shouting at the world's governments to do something.  There simply wasn't any warning.
If economics is about understanding the economy, it is my opinion that it is not doing a great job achieving this objective.  Yes, there are some very basic concepts that we can all agree on, like supply and demand, but beyond that, what will happen due to certain fiscal and monetary policies is anyone's guess.  
A darker explanation for the failure of economics to predict financial catastrophes is that smart, informed economists are lying or being actively suppressed.  Or, that power is concentrated into the hands of so few people, that their whims are what drives these crises, not policy.

This is exactly what I'm saying.  We need exchanges so lots of people can convert fiat into BTC in a short amount of time.  Since exchanges are a point of failure in this process, we need regulations that are protective of exchanges, which is what this new law appears to do.  It doesn't affect Bitcoin itself... once enough people have converted fiat into BTC and BTC has become a widely used currency, exchanges won't be as important as they are now.
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:04:14
I think Bitcoin does have a lot to offer, even absent the politics and speculation.  I believe it has the potential to make life much easier for everyone, especially poor people and people in third-world countries.  Remittances and microtransactions are being revolutionized.  Merchants can benefit from the lack of chargebacks and fraud.  Small, private transactions become frictionless and anonymous.  I admit, the technology is still rough around the edges, but eventually it will be so easy to use that mass adoption is inevitable.  It may be replaced by some other cryptocurrency, but the concept of the blockchain is brilliant and here to stay.

Bitcoin has infinite time to get things right. It's open source software, so as long as someone is working on some aspect of the core protocol or the infrastructure, it's always improving. The only reason bitcoin may not be inevitable is if something better comes along, which it hasn't yet. I think sidechains should eliminate even that possibility.

That's a fair point... Pardon my lack of economic knowledge. I guess if the real value of currency is always increasing, that can be considered a type of deflation. Wikipedia thinks that Bitcoin technically exhibits disinflation, not deflation, unless I'm misunderstanding something. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation). 
I feel like it doesn't matter if everything is always getting cheaper, though... look at the prices of electronics over the past generation. And look at the price of gold... It's always going up. That doesn't prevent people from selling it. 
Plus, no one knows if a currency whose money supply is expanding at a constantly decreasing rate will actually be bad for an economy... Over the next few years, we should find out. These are exciting times, where different economic theories can be subject to science! 
I'd also like to point out that Bitcoin will have an inflation rate of at least 3.7% until 2021, when the block reward will halve to 6.25, giving an inflation rate of 1.79% ( see the section at the bottom for an interesting note on deflation). At this point, there should be other cryptocurrencies, so if we discover that deflation is in fact an issue, we can always switch currencies. 
I'm only trying to learn about economics here, thanks for correcting my misunderstandings.

Great question. The chance of solving a proof-of-work for a block is the same regardless of the number of transactions included in that block. Miners are incentivized to include as many transactions as possible through transaction fees. 
Edit: in response to your follow-up, the solution to the proof-of-work problem depends upon the most recent block in the longest chain. You can't "pre-mine" because the problem all miners are trying to solve resets every ~10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:35:32
No. The great thing about bitcoin is that, unlike fiat currency, you can't use a large position in order to steal the wealth of those with a smaller position. Imagine that you owned 10% of all bitcoins, and the market cap of bitcoins is $10T dollars, so you've got the bitcoin equivalent of $1T. Now imagine that there are no fiat currencies, and no banks. How can you "enslave" anyone? You can either invest your bitcoins in something, or spend it. Once you spend it, you no longer have a large position. If you invest it in something evil, people will just stop using bitcoin and your holdings are worthless.

That's fair. So I suppose the other scenario in which downward pressure is created is when very early adopters spend their coins at any merchant selling a product they desire. The conditions necessary for this are merely that the current price is higher than the price at which the coins were purchased. The problem is, the price hasn't maintained a lower value than the current price since over a year ago. If I may ask, in the past year, how many BTC would you say you've spent at merchants that convert to fiat?

Changetip keeps all the transactions in their own database. The only time the blockchain gets involved is when you withdraw.

I agree that it would be *theoretically* possible to build a totally separate economy with just cryptocurrencies, but it would be very impractical to do so.  It would be difficult for Bitcoin become the "currency of the Internet" without somehow interacting with the US Dollar and other fiat currencies, since fiat currencies are the incumbent "currency of the Internet". 
The way your idea would have to work is that websites would have to begin setting their prices in BTC without anyone knowing the value in fiat.  Not very many people would be comfortable buying a product priced in such a way, and only the miners would have possession of any coins, at least at the beginning.  The only way to acquire coins other than mining them would be to sell something other than fiat in exchange for them which, again, I don't believe very many people would do.  You need price discovery in order for commerce to proceed.
So, the advantage of having exchanges is two-fold:  1) it enhances distribution of the currency since you don't have to mine them or sell property in order to acquire them and 2) it allows merchants and buyers to transact with confidence that the transactions are fair.
As we've seen with all new technology, the only way to get the public to switch paradigms is to make the new paradigm backwards-compatible with the old paradigm.

Here's what I got from reading the paper. Let me know if I got anything wrong :) 
Understanding sidechains requires you to view Bitcoin as two separate things: the Bitcoin blockchain, and bitcoins, which are assets that float around on that blockchain. The sidechain paper basically asserts that there really isn't any need for your bitcoins to stay on one blockchain forever. Instead, the paper imagines a system of many blockchains, with bitcoins from the original Bitcoin blockchain floating around all of them, so instead of alt*coins*, which are a separate asset, you'd have alt*chains* (sidechains) which carry bitcoins. 
There are many advantages to such a system. First and most importantly, it would allow experimentation on a much faster and broader scale than under the current system. Currently, any significant improvement to blockchain technology must be either implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is dangerous because so many people have so much money invested in bitcoins, or it must be implemented as its own new asset, which is difficult because the creator must convince people that it will work so that they will invest hashing power and/or wealth into it, which is risky because if the altcoin fails, that investment disappears. Under the sidechain system, any bitcoins remaining on a "failed" sidechain will be transferable back to the main Bitcoin blockchain, preserving their value. 
This will allow many more people to experiment with both the technical and economic variables of blockchain technology without fear of destroying everyone's wealth. If a sidechain is eventually found to be superior to the current Bitcoin blockchain, people can simply migrate their coins to the new blockchain, no hard fork required. 
Another advantage of sidechains is that it will enable the creation of blockchains that specialize in specific use cases, like microtransactions. There are many more possibilities for stuff you can do with sidechains, but I hope this explains the main idea.

Why does everyone keep saying Bitcoin is "deflationary"? The money supply is constantly increasing, so Bitcoin is actually an inflationary currency.

Yes, that's a good point. I believe a hard fork is necessary for some improvements to the ecdsa implementation, for instance. The article takes note of which improvements require forks. A hard fork event is definitely problematic since people basically have to wait until it's over in order to be sure their transactions will get verified, but I believe in the community to coordinate to resolve hard forks successfully. If VISA were having an outage, you can expect that efforts would be made to make sure people are ready for it.

Well written, but unfortunately not a permanent concern. If mining centralization ends up in a monopoly, bitcoin will collapse because no one will want to hold it.

I respectfully disagree. No one knows you're not spending your bitcoin because you're hoarding it, believing its value will increase. They just think you're not using it because it must not be that great. Anybody can claim to be holding bitcoin, but until you spend it, you could just as easily be making shit up. For many people I've introduced to bitcoin, the "aha" moment comes once they witness an actual transaction.


My message is not for these people. If you're cool with a shrinking stash of bitcoin, you probably don't believe in its long-term success. These are called "weak hands" and I'll gladly relieve them of their coins. 


Not sure what I said to imply that I'm "incapable of helping the community", as I believe I'm doing everything I can, which is increasing my holdings every month, spending a little to spread awareness, participating in my local community events, and writing code. 


Actually, the killer app for bitcoin was the original Silk Road. What achieved today's success was people buying bitcoins *in order to spend them*. 


Yes, because people can *use it to buy stuff*. 


No. As I said, bitcoin has utility in facilitating the online black market. Other killer apps are forthcoming, but that is the one thing you can use it for that you *have* to use it for. 


Sorry, but again, I disagree with your assessment. Feel free to continue hoarding your coins. I'm not going to tell you what to do with your coins, just don't tell me what to do with mine.

You are correct in saying that the real driver of bitcoin's long term value is how much the switch to bitcoin will benefit the average person, and we're not really there yet. I spend bitcoin because I see spreading knowledge about how easy it is use as one of the ways I can help increase the value of my (and everyone else's) holdings. 
However, this isn't my only strategy. As I said before, the real thing that will eventually make people switch to bitcoin is all the cool shit that you can do with it that hasn't been built yet. That's why I'm also participating in the bitcoin community, collaborating on projects, brainstorming with ideas, and writing actual code. We're like the Internet in the 80s. People will eventually use bitcoin, but only once the infrastructure's been built out and there's a ton of cool shit you can do with bitcoin that you could never do without it.

Wrong. Digital signal processing allows for pattern recognition on faces, voices, gaits, irises, thought patterns, and any other biometric feature that can be reduced to a digital signal. Successful implementation of such advanced pattern recognition usually relies on a period of "training" the software to recognize your particular "signature" under different conditions. I'd imagine that you'd want to thoroughly train a device like this if you were using it to secure a large amount of coins.

It's actually a chicken-and-egg type situation.  If a few people are pricing things in bitcoins, then yes, asking prices will be volatile.  If a lot of people are pricing things in bitcoins, not so much.  The value of a currency is how much you can trade it for elsewhere.  Your fiat currency of choice is stable because, for any given amount of it, you are picturing what you could buy with that amount, and it's a fixed value in your mind.  
A related idea is metric vs. imperial measurements.  It's hard to get Americans to switch to the metric system because they have a specific idea of how many feet tall a person is, how many pounds they weigh, etc.  We could switch over to the metric system by simply starting to measure things in metric, but people haven't started doing that yet because they're comfortable with the old system.

The FED was created and is owned by private banks. See   Central banking was invented by private banks to give them the power to create money.  
This power was stolen from the control of the people by large private banks through the strategy of abruptly contracting the money supply after a period of easy money, causing banking panics.  See  for strategies banks use to induce panics.  Search for the word "contraction".  A central bank is the ultimate fractional reserve bank, having an effective reserve requirement of 0%.  But even without a central bank, large fractional reserve banks controlling the vast majority of a nation's credit can collude to contract the money supply, causing panics.  The only way to prevent bank panics is either 1) Just give up and let the banks have their central bank, exacting an invisible tax on the economy, or 2) get rid of fractional reserve banking.
The Federal Reserve's purpose is to keep the American people subjugated to the power of the financial system.  All it needs to do to ensure that the people will not revolt against the system is 1) make sure runaway inflation does not occur (which would destroy the dollar and thus their stranglehold on the economy) and 2) make sure unemployment stays relatively low.  As long as most people are employed, you can expect them not to violently revolt.

I think you may be misunderstanding what sidechains do. Sidechains don't allow bitcoin to absorb money from altcoins. They allow bitcoins to float to other blockchains, which would be the sidechains. These sidechains don't exist yet because they haven't yet been implemented in the protocol. The reason everyone is excited about them is that they'll allow experimentation in blockchain technology (which is what the altcoins are doing now) at a faster rate than currently possible, because devs are afraid to experiment on bitcoin because so much money is at stake, and innovative altcoins aren't popping up very often because people aren't investing in them (because of bitcoin's network effect and vast mining security). Sidechains attempt to fix this by combining altcoins' ability to experiment with bitcoin's value and security.

It's true that a lot of people would lose a lot of money... but I think fiat insolvency is different from BTC insolvency since (as we've already seen with Gox the past few months) people will still sell BTC for fiat on an exchange that appears to be having trouble processing fiat withdrawals, but no one will trade on an exchange that shuts off BTC withdrawals.  Basically, the only reason Gox is in trouble now is because there is literally no way to get fiat or BTC out.  If BTC reserves were guaranteed, at least you'd be able to convert all your USD to BTC (yes, probably taking a considerable loss) and then withdraw BTC.
In addition to this, having proof of BTC reserves is better than having none because it's public knowledge if your exchange is running low on reserves.  This enables customers to make more informed decisions about trading, and it enables the customers who want less risk to get out while they still can, while leaving customers who want to gamble on the exchange's fiat solvency to do that if they want.  The major complaint with Gox is that people who thought their funds were safe were lied to.  At least with proven BTC reserves, there'd be actual information about the risk. 
So maybe the full-reserve scheme is not the complete solution that it's cracked up to be, but I still think it's better than nothing.
Also, and this might not be much comfort, but having to state your BTC reserves would be an extra incentive for exchanges to use best security practices (and not get hacked in the first place).  Further, it would force exchanges to admit upfront when they're hacked, which transfers the risk from the customer to the exchange.
Basically what I think I'm saying is that the full-reserve scheme is better than the current system because it transfers most of the risk of trading on an exchange from the customer to the exchange (which is where it should be).

Sure, observational/social sciences exist, but my assertion is that they are inferior to experimental science, to the point that I hesitate to use the word "science".  Religion and astrology used to be "observational sciences".  These sciences will always give us theories that explain many, or even most, phenomena in a given field.  However, only testing under controlled conditions can give us theories that explain all observed phenomena.
The main problem that I have with economics is that the "experts" often appear to have no idea what's going on, and are frequently very, very wrong with their predictions about the economy.  So much so that they don't really provide any value to society, because which economist should we trust?

I don't think it matters whether or not fiat reserves can be proved... the problem with Gox is that people can't withdraw their BTC because the BTC don't exist.  Gox was already having trouble processing fiat withdrawals, which is indeed a problem, but not as big of a problem as being unable to process BTC withdrawals.  I assume that if you are on an exchange that has proven BTC reserves, you can always exit the market by converting all your dollars to BTC then withdrawing.  You might have to take a slight loss, but it's basically not a problem compared to Gox losing everyone's BTC.

I see this as a good thing, for the same reason I see Bitcoin as helpful to digital security in general. Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, creating an incentive to attack individual users' wallets helps everyone in the long run, because it incentivizes innovation in personal digital security while only hurting a few people who didn't properly secure their coins. In the same way, because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin + sidechains, 51% attacks on sidechains will incentivize innovation in the field of preventing 51% attacks. With sidechains, we have an infinite number of tries before we create a sidechain that is impervious to 51% attacks (or as close to impervious as possible). Every time a sidechain fails, people will just create one that's better. Yes, people will lose money, but there needs to be a better solution to this problem.

Yes. It's no longer as bad as it used to be, but the ignorant shit some publications say about bitcoin has definitely caused me to lose trust in the media as a whole. It's one thing to falsify a report of something that only you (and maybe a few others) witnessed. It's another thing entirely to take a subject like bitcoin where literally all relevant knowledge is a matter of easily-Googleable public record and somehow get that wrong. It just amazes me what some of these "journalists" will report as fact without bothering to look it up, or even ask someone who knows.

Interesting problem. 
Let's see, there are 21E6*1E8 = 2.1E15 satoshis, there are 2^160 possible addresses, or about 1.46E48. So by the strategy of trying every private key, converting it to an address and checking its balance, you have a probability of 2.1E15 / 1.46E48 = 1.4368783E−33, or about 1 in 7E32 chance of guessing one of the populated addresses. Assuming you could do 1 billion guesses per second (because I have no idea and that seems high), that'd take you on average about 7E23 seconds to accomplish, or about 2.2E16 years to accomplish. According to Wikipedia, the heat death should occur in about 1E100 years, so it's in the realm of possibility there. According to the random Google search "how long until the universe ends", the Big Rip would occur in 80 billion years, so you're out of luck there. Either way, I can't say that it'd be worth the effort.

@_date: 2014-11-15 07:31:38
I think you may be misunderstanding what sidechains do. Sidechains are not altcoins. Sidechains don't allow bitcoin to absorb money from altcoins. They allow bitcoins to float to other blockchains, or sidechains, that are connected to the main bitcoin blockchain. These sidechains don't exist yet because they haven't yet been implemented in the protocol. The reason everyone is excited about them is that they'll allow experimentation in blockchain technology (which is what the altcoins are doing now) at a faster rate than currently possible, because devs are afraid to experiment on bitcoin because so much money is at stake, and innovative altcoins aren't popping up very often because people aren't investing in them (because of bitcoin's network effect and vast mining security). Sidechains attempt to fix this by combining altcoins' ability to experiment with bitcoin's value and security.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:11:36
Yeah, I disagree with this. Bitcoin adoption drives the value up, which drives adoption. But bitcoin is fundamentally superior to fiat, which provides the initial push into bitcoin. Furthermore, bitcoin is ultimately deflationary while fiat is inflationary. All of this spells doom for fiat currencies in the long term.

Yes, there are lots of differences between the currencies you mentioned. For example, litecoin and dogecoin have a shorter block time than bitcoin, and dogecoin's supply is unlimited.

No. The way transaction fees work is, each miner decides whether or not to include transactions, weighing the fee vs the size of the transaction. There are miners out there that include no-fee transactions, and if one of these miners happens to mine a block, it doesn't matter if you include a fee or not. However, the probability that one of these extra-friendly miners will mine the next block is extremely low, so most likely you'll be waiting a very long time. Thus, if you include a low fee, the probability that your transaction makes it into the next block is lower than if you include a high fee. 
So basically what will happen, once all the coins are mined, is that the mining market will determine what the minimum fee should be to include a transaction in the next block, just as it does now.

I respectfully disagree.  Personal digital security is still catching up to bank security in terms of ease of use and reliability, but there is a process underway such that the need for institutional security will eventually be unnecessary.
1) Having your money in a fractional reserve banking system effectively gives control of 90%+ of the money supply to the banks, giving them the power to expand and contract the money supply at will.  Now that there is a way to be your own bank, people will eventually move in that direction because as knowledge spreads about how the fractional reserve system presents an ongoing threat to stability, people will realize that having control of your assets is superior to having a bank look after them.  People are already doing this more and more.  See [this simulator]( for more on fractional reserve banking.
2) Since at least some people are trying to keep control over their own money, this provides a monetary incentive for hackers to try to steal people's bitcoins.
3) This provides an incentive for new and better wallet software, which is being developed all the time.  See [Armory]( [BitGo]( [Dark Wallet]( for some examples of active wallet projects that are doing this now.
4) Eventually, personal digital security catches up and everyone and their mother can have a Bitcoin wallet that is secure, easy to use, and doesn't allow the banks to control the money supply.

Just speculating here, but I don't think so. If I were a merchant selling widgets, I'd set my price to maximize profits. There'd be no reason for me to raise prices unless other merchants were doing so, or unless I realized that the market were willing to pay more money for the same widget. Since the goods/services the CPI tracks are mostly bought by low-income people, and since the new money hasn't [yet?] trickled down to these people, it would seem unwise for a merchant to raise prices on them.

If you mean this as an insult, your understanding of the Dunning-Kruger effect is inaccurate.

Hmm, good question, I don't know. I suppose the exchange rate would need to adjust with the variances in supply between the two currencies, either before converting from bitcoins to SIDEDOGE, or before converting from SIDEDOGE back to bitcoins. In the latter case, your money would lose value over time. In the former case, your bitcoin-backed SIDEDOGE would become more valuable than other SIDEDOGE coins, damaging the fungibility of the sidechain. The only other scenario I can imagine off the top of my head is that sidechains will not be allowed to have a block reward, and only the main chain's supply will increase, which would seem to nullify the goal of opening up economic innovation. Perhaps it will be possible to experiment with all these methods?

Because that makes it a great store of value, so it encourages investment and early adoption, which is the only way to ensure mass adoption. If you buy $1B and there are $10T total, you have .01% of all dollars. In 30 years, however, you're likely to have .005% or less of all dollars because of inflation. So, dollars are not a good long term investment. With bitcoin, however, you know that 2100 btc will always be at least .01% of all bitcoins, forever.

Ok.  I see what you're saying now.  I still think you are incorrect, about two things:
1) The Dunning-Kruger effect does not apply.  The Wikipedia article mentions incompetent people overestimating *their own* relative competence, and competent people underestimating theirs.  Never does it mention incompetent people overestimating the relative skills of *other incompetent people*.  As much as that may be a related concept, it does not accurately describe what you claim is happening here.
2) What you claim is happening here is not accurate, unless you can prove that you are more competent than myself and riccardb.  Since this is an Internet forum, don't you think it's easier to debate the actual facts in a mature and rational manner instead of resorting to insults?

It's more the fact that the monetary system is a giant Ponzi scheme.  See: 
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:14:43
Average confirmation time is the average amount of time a transaction waits before it is included in a block by a miner. A transaction is included in a block if a miner decides that it meets the minimum fee requirement and is valid. If you send a transaction with no fee, most miners will ignore it, but there are some miners that process zero-fee transactions, so your transaction will likely go through, just not for a while, like a day or more. That is, average confirmation time for a zero-fee transaction will be much higher than for a transaction with the fee included. So, average confirmation time is really a representation of the average transaction fee versus the average threshold fee expected by miners in order to include the transaction in a block. If the average confirmation time goes down, that means either 1) users have (on average) started including higher fees with their transactions, or 2) miners have (on average) started expecting lower fees in order to include a given transaction in a block. Since we can point to a update where the default fees were lowered right about when this drop in confirmation times happened, I'm guessing that was the cause.

First of all, David Friedman *is* an economist according to the definition of economist, which, to quote one random Internet source (Wikipedia) is "a professional in the social science discipline of economics. The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about economic policy." That is to say, in order to be an economist, all one needs to do is *write about economic policy*, which Friedman certainly has done. 
Second, it continues to blow me away how people think that, unless someone has a degree in the specific area they're discussing, they somehow can't be trusted. I personally studied electrical engineering in college, but that certainly isn't the only thing I know about, nor is it my profession. Is Friedman a physicist because he studied physics in college? 
Third, economics is a "social" science, which puts it in the same category as sociology and politics... Yes, there are "traditions" of thought in all these areas, but at the end of the day, you can't perform controlled experiments with them; therefore, they are not science. Anyone can speak and write about these topics, and as long as the theories make sense, there's no telling who's right and who's wrong. 
If you read through the citations at the bottom, it's clear this guy has done a lot of reading on economics, and knows how to apply these concepts to synthesize new ideas. Were all of his sources also not "trained" in economics? Does it matter? 
All I'm trying to get across is that I, and most people on this subreddit, are not impressed with a rebuttal stating effectively, "I don't trust that guy; therefore he's wrong". Do your beliefs consist only of things dictated to you by figures of authority that you trust?

Just answering your question "What can you do with litecoin that you cannot do with bitcoin?" 
Technically it's the usage network that gives a currency its value. Liquidity is derived directly from value, so the statement "liquidity is what gives currency its value" is circular. 
The usage network is actually what's important in driving the value up. The more people who will accept a given currency for goods and services, the more of a good idea it is for me to hold some. Holding is what drives the value up. 
The hashing algorithm is not "irrelevant". Centralization in mining is one of the biggest threats to bitcoin. If bitcoin gets 51% attacked and melts down, people are going to flock to a currency where this is less likely to happen, ie litecoin. 
Thus the best use for litecoin, in my opinion, is as a hedge against the catastrophic failure of bitcoin. I think that alone gives it value.

"It's only used to buy illegal things" is the same sort of nonsense argument as people made when Colorado was deciding whether or not to legalize cannabis. One of the "against" arguments was that it's illegal under federal law. Well, if we want legal weed, there are only 2 ways to achieve this: wait for the government to make it legal, or just ignore the federal government. The same was true with bittorrent. The same is true of e-money. We can either wait until the powers that be decide that it's legal, or we can simply start using it. At first, this means that its most compelling use case will be the purchase of goods on the black market. That doesn't mean that's its only possible use; that just means that lots of things are unnecessarily illegal.

I think the particular value of demurrage, implemented as destroying outputs older than a certain age, would be two-fold; first, lost coins would cease to be a problem, and second, the velocity of bitcoins would increase.

Fine, but if that's true, I think it's premature for you to disagree with a point of view you've never heard. 
The reason I think the Internet (in combination with blockchain technology) will obviate the state is because the high degree of interconnectivity of the Internet incentivizes honesty. If you have an online identity, it's to your advantage to build a positive reputation for that identity, because once you screw someone over, the record of that is out in the open forever. It used to be that people could get away with this repeatedly, and therefore the state was required to preempt this from happening by issuing and enforcing regulations. But with the Internet, since information about dishonest people is readily available, we don't need regulations; bad behavior is disincentivized inherently. 
With blockchain technology, this effect is guaranteed, since it effectively decentralizes trust. With blockchains, we can enforce the rules through mathematics rather than through a centralized institution with a monopoly on force. I assert that any "gaming" of the system can be counteracted by increasing the overall level of interconnectivity in society. This includes making more and more "private" data public. As long as everyone has an equal level of privacy, the system works. I think more and more loss of privacy is inevitable given the constantly decreasing cost of technology, and I'm ok with that, as long as I have access to the same data about anyone else as they have about me.

Right now, debt is only useful to businesses just starting out. The way this can be handled without banks is by selling shares of your business to the public, or crowdfunding, no middleman required. Once we get rid of fractional reserve banking, the wealth in the hands of the people will multiply by at least 10 times, and the aggregate debt of the world will be much lower, removing the perceived need for credit cards and other such nonsense.

Bitcoin's economy is fundamentally superior to the fiat economy, since Bitcoin, through anonymity and strong crypto, encourages honest behavior as it theoretically can only be spent voluntarily, while fiat encourages destructive behavior such as corruption, theft, and war. Because of this fundamental difference, Bitcoin's economy will continue to grow much faster than the fiat economy until it supplants it.

Look at the BTC graph at bitcoinwisdom.com, set it to logarithmic scale and zoom out to the "1d" time interval.  As you can see, we are following basically the exact same trend as the previous bubble.  The market is finding the bottom again, same as it did last year around July or so.  If there weren't bubbles, the value of bitcoin would just increase exponentially (a line straight up and to the right on bitcoinwisdom) until mass adoption.  As it is, we're still in a bubble, but I believe we've pretty much hit bottom, and prices should start increasing in the next month or so.

"Also not sure how this works: You give a bank 100 dollars, they can actually lend up 1000 dollars from that original 100 to other people. Does that compute?"
That's not exactly how the money multiplier works... the idea is that, with a whole bunch of banks borrowing and lending, they can borrow from each other.  With a 10% reserve requirement, the original bank can only lend out $90 from your original deposit (making $190 from the original $100 money supply).  But if another bank borrows that $90, they can they can lend out $81, further expanding the money supply to $271.  The process continues until the original cash deposit of $100 becomes $1000 in the money supply.  That's the magic of fractional reserve banking, and actually, this isn't a problem with fiat currencies, it's a problem with banks, so bitcoin will not be immune. See  for more info.

Yes! I've been telling people this. When you own bitcoin, you're invested in the success of the whole network, like owning stock in a company. So you're a user, but it's open source, so you can also actively add to the value of the network, so it's like you're an employee.

Notice how you said "I" can eat it.  It has value *to you* because *you* can use it.  Some people don't like bread, or can't eat bread.  It probably has less value to these people.  A lot of people can agree that something is valuable *to them*, but it is never technically correct to say something *has* value.  I realize that this is splitting hairs with something like food in general, where practically every living thing would agree it has value; however, it still doesn't make sense to say that an item can somehow contain value.

Sidechains are a proposed improvement to Bitcoin that hasn't yet been implemented.

You are correct that this happens with paper / metal currencies, because governments can always issue more, decreasing their value. However, with cryptocurrencies, the supply never increases, so it's impossible to determine whether currency on one sidechain is "worth more" than currency on any other sidechain. Indeed, the value of the base coin can never increase relative to the value of the side coin because any amount of side coin can freely be converted into an equivalent amount of base coin. In terms of paper / metal currencies, this would be as if there were two types of coins, a pure gold one and a "debased" gold one, but any amount of debased coin could be easily converted into the equivalent value of pure coin, simultaneously decreasing the supply of debased coin and increasing the supply of pure coin. In such a system, there would be no reason for people to hoard the pure coin, so no way for the relative value of the coins to vary.

What I mean by "great investment" is that its growth potential is still enormous, even now in 2014. Notice that no one was saying bitcoin was an awesome investment in 2009. You're still an early adopter now. If bitcoin takes over global commerce, remittances and microtransactions, it's potentially the most valuable commodity in history, worth on the order of $100T total, which is around $4M per coin, or about 10,000 times more than it's currently worth. Even if it achieves nowhere near this, I think you have to admit that's still way better than any of the "safe" investments people normally throw their money at. Well, it's more exciting, anyway.

Regulation implies the ability to prosecute if the regulation is broken, which implies the ability to prove the regulation was indeed broken.  With care, all bitcoin transactions are potentially anonymous (and therefore impossible to connect to a person), and if this proves not to be the case, something else (like ZeroCoin) will fix that.

If intrinsic value refers to the cost of producing an item (which I would consider an abuse of semantics), then it is a useless metric.  Who cares if I paid someone a million dollars to dig up a ton of dirt from around the world and ship it to me?  That doesn't give the pile of dirt any kind of "value" that we can use to predict its market value.  
Let's consider another example: art.  What has more intrinsic value, a painting by Jackson Pollock, or the Mona Lisa?  What about George Bush's paintings of dogs? Why?
Or what if I hire a team of engineers to build a robot that automatically cooks breakfast.  It takes years to develop and costs millions of dollars, but doesn't work.  Does the resulting product, though non-functional, have intrinsic value?


Ok, but your definition rids the concept of any usefulness as a metric.  Also, note that Wikipedia calls it the "intrinsic *theory* of value", and that theory is very problematic.  
Value is simply a subjective metric of the relative amount different things are worth to an individual. The perception that an asset is valued highly by others increases its subjective value.  If two people stand to increase the subjective value of their assets by transacting, then that is a fair transaction.

I think what you mean here is that it encourages *investing*, and investing in bitcoin feels really good because it's a great investment. Anytime you allocate resources, you're investing. The "safe" investment choices the system offers us are no fun because they are, by and large, terrible investments. Buying cheap crap that you'll throw away within a year is an awful investment that loses all of its value very fast. Investing in fiat money feels ridiculous because it loses at least 1% of its value, guaranteed, every year, at the whim of some central banker. Investing in a new car is a terrible idea, because it loses a huge chunk of its value immediately after it's driven off the lot. A mortgage seems like a good idea, except you usually end up paying way more for your house than you actually own in equity. There are better ways to do all of these things where you don't end up losing a bunch of money, if you're clever, but generally speaking you're not going to *increase* your wealth through any of these vehicles. That is, there's no growth potential, and that's where all the fun is. 
Bitcoin is like none of these things. You just pay the market rate for your selected slice of the BTC pie, and then the network strictly enforces the fact that you own that percentage of all bitcoins. The growth potential of bitcoin is astronomical, so it's exciting to invest in even if it eventually crashes to zero. 
This removal of risk from common investments is the main problem with our current global economy. Instead of more *saving*, what we need is more *investing*. When you save money in a bank account, you're not just saving. You're loaning money to some people who have decided that they are solely qualified to decide where society should invest its extra cash. There are a number of problems with this. First, if they screw up, the government is there to bail them out with (more of) your money. Second, if you're trying to start a business (and where do jobs come from besides new businesses?), you pretty much *have* to get a loan from these guys, or you can try for some VC money, which puts a lid on the number of businesses that can be started while raising the minimum amount of money that must be raised in order for the average business to succeed. This means fewer ideas are tried, which means fewer things succeed. It also means huge amounts of malinvestment, especially in such an inflationary environment. Very inefficient. 
Bitcoin/blockchain technology will blow off this lid with crowdfunding. When it becomes commonplace to invest in businesses through cryptoequities, you won't have a savings/retirement account with 90% of your portfolio; you'll have a smaller portion in cash (bitcoin) and a much larger portion in equities with huge growth potential. Everyone will become an "investor" (even though that's what everyone already is). The risk will be distributed among the individual investors, rather than centralized, which, as we've seen, can cause global financial catastrophes. The amount of malinvestment will be minimized once there are consequences for making bad investments. Of course, there will still be "safe" investments for individuals nearing retirement, but individuals and society as a whole will need to be much smarter with where they invest their money, causing the whole system to become much more efficient. Under this new system, aggregate global wealth is set to explode. 
And that's another reason why I'm excited to invest in bitcoin - because it feels like I'm helping drive us towards this bright future.

I suspect that a deflationary spiral is an artifact of the fractional reserve banking system.  In a non-debt-based economy, the money supply is not subject to sudden, sharp contractions.
Also, it looks like deflation happens because people hoard cash.  Since Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places, this would appear to be less of a problem than it is with actual, hard currency.

What I mean is that bitcoin proves that it's possible to realign incentives such that being honest is more profitable than being dishonest, and there is nothing to gain from being violent. 
We aren't there yet, but now that people can hold money totally anonymously, it is not economically sustainable to steal their wealth through violent means because it's impossible to know who owns what amount (unless they tell you). 
We aren't there yet, but because taxes and central banking will be eliminated, the only way to acquire wealth will be for someone to willingly give you their bitcoin. That is, the only way to get money will be to *honestly earn it*. 
We aren't there yet, but bitcoin points the way.

Yes, there will be scams and busts from time to time, but every time this happens, we come together as a community to find permanent solutions to these problems. So bash people in the fiat economy all you want for profit-seeking, as fiat money incentivizes dishonesty, corruption, and war. But don't bash bitcoin businesses for trying to spread the adoption of bitcoin - by design, this behavior will benefit everyone in the long run. If these businesses also happen to make a profit, more power to them; they wouldn't be doing it otherwise. 
Edit: does anyone care to explain these downvotes? Why don't you engage me in a discussion if you disagree?

Yes, I agree that your explanation is more exact. I guess a good analogy might be a system of currencies that are all pegged to a parent currency at a fixed exchange rate, like the Saudi Arabian riyal is pegged to the US dollar. You can hold whatever percentage of your cash in these currencies and, in theory, your assets will always have the same value.

Fascinating!! Interesting how the tx rate appears to be getting more and more periodic as its popularity grows. I suppose that's because it's becoming more correlated with the cycle of commerce as it matures. 
I'd guess 12-hrly cones from people on one side of the globe using it more, and bi-weekly is probably appearing because it's the second harmonic of weekly, unless Wednesdays and Saturdays (or something) are just more popular than the other days :p

Why do you think Greenbacks were not awesome? Besides the fact that the government could issue as much as they wanted? From the Wikipedia article ( it seems like Greenbacks were a wildly successful way to fund the way effort, and they recovered most of their value against gold in subsequent years.  In 1996 when this documentary was made, government-backed fiat was indeed the best monetary system.  Now that we have Bitcoin, we don't even need to trust the government not to devalue the currency, but I think you have to agree that Greenbacks and free banking are a better system than central banking.

I think you'll have an incentive to spend your bitcoins on the next speculative bubble, when they're worth way more. I'm hoping this will happen eventually, because it seems as though more and more people are buying and holding.

Yes.  There are a few different kinds of nodes: 
* **SPV nodes** or "light wallets", which most bitcoin wallets are.  These monitor the bitcoin network for traffic related to their addresses and can broadcast bitcoin transactions.
* **Full nodes**, which help out with verifying transactions as they contain a full copy of the blockchain.  Thus, full nodes have the job of relaying valid transactions to other nodes and filtering out invalid transactions by not relaying them.  Wallets which also function as a full node include Bitcoin Core and Armory.
* **Miners** are full nodes that also produce blocks to get the mining reward.  These can be either mining pools or solo miners.
So the answer to your question is that your transaction is broadcast to all of these.  The SPV nodes ignore them unless they're related to the addresses the wallet controls.  The full nodes relay them to other nodes if valid, and ignore them if not.  The mining pools gather transactions into a "mempool" of valid transactions, repeatedly hashing this set of transactions to try and find a block header which has a certain number of zeros at the beginning.  Once this block header is found, the mining pool announces the new block to all of the nodes it's connected to.


Yes, mining pools have their own full nodes, so they see transactions as they come in.


Miners can choose to include or leave out transactions a their discretion.  Most miners try to include as many valid transactions as possible, because the transaction fees for all the transactions in a block go directly to the miner who mined that block.  But some mining pools have been known to mine blocks with only a coinbase transaction (the transaction that creates new coins and sends them to the miner) and no other transactions.


As described above, as soon as a miner finds a hash of all the transactions they'd like to include, they can then broadcast the block to the nodes they're connected to.  It's then up to the nodes in the network to come to a consensus about whether the new block is valid.  There are lots of criteria for whether a new block is valid.  Here are some:
* **[Block header]( Does it actually solves the mining puzzle?  The block header must point to the most recent block on the longest chain.  Does it?
* **Block structure**: Is the block small enough (current limit is 1MB)?  Is the coinbase transaction first?  Does the structure of the block conform to expectations?
* **Transactions**: Are they all valid?  When combined together, do they produce the Merkle root listed in the header?
Once miners have determined that a block is valid, they simply need to start working on the next block, in the chain, making sure the even newer block is pointing at the new block.  So, a new block is "confirmed" once an *even newer* block is created which points back at it.  That's it.
Hope that was helpful!

I don't think it's valid to initiate violence to recover your "stolen capital", if you've been scammed into giving that capital away. It's not the State's fault if someone tricks you, it's your fault. We don't need to prevent scams from happening, we just need to learn from them after they happen, to prevent them from happening again. Scams indicate a weakness in the system, but open information on the Internet (such as right here on Reddit) is how we fight this weakness. We don't need a violent entity to enforce rules - let's face it, scams happen all the time anyway. Whenever you put your trust in a system to prevent scams, you risk being scammed by that system.

I didn't say fractional reserve is *impossible* with bitcoin; I said it has *the ability to eliminate* fractional reserve. Without an FDIC or a central bank to be the lender of last resort, banks who practice fractional reserve will continue to experience panics. Coupled with real time proof of reserves (possible now), this will drive the public to eventually refuse to use fractional reserve banks. 


I disagree that bitcoin will not improve upon this. Bitcoin enables me to buy stuff from small arts and crafts dealers in Africa and other places whose standard of living is lower than mine, or from people who would otherwise be homeless or desperate. This necessarily normalizes the standard of living globally, which reduces poverty. 


See above. A lower cost of being honest coupled with a higher cost of being dishonest will drive people to earn an honest living. I guess this makes me an optimist, but I believe virtually everyone, if given the opportunity to earn an honest living, will choose that over a life of crime. Maybe this won't eliminate crime, but it should get us close. 


I'm not necessarily referring to *bitcoin's* blockchain. Look at Ethereum or Counterparty or Factom for other potential uses of blockchain technology. Anything that can be recorded can be recorded in a blockchain. A truly decentralized eBay hasn't been built yet, but there's no reason it won't be. 


You only need to be scammed once to learn your lesson. If you don't, you deserve to be scammed. The reason your average person is fairly gullible is because they're used to large, centralized organizations looking out for them. A system without these institutions will produce less gullible people. 


The oracle's reputation is on the line, too. If an oracle is known for being wrong, people will stop trusting it. 


These problems can be fixed. Use your imagination. The reason the government can be used for protection is because all your assets are effectively collateral in any contract you participate in, because the government "knows where you live", as it were, and it can take everything if you screw up. So, a decentralized contract system simply needs to allow both sides to put up collateral in case of a breach of contract. Again, this isn't widely used, but once it is, people will no longer accept contracts from parties who offer no recourse in case of a breach. 


And your lack of imagination is boring me. You're too concerned with the present. There are solutions to all of these problems now that we have blockchains. Wait a generation or so. The world will be much better than you can imagine. We just need to build it now.

That's kind of a strange thing to say... Anytime you buy an asset with a different asset, you're investing.

Isn't that better than buying worthless crap?

What's surreal to me is the whole "bitcoin bad, blockchain good" sentiment floating around right now. Bitcoin's blockchain is the only one that matters right now, so if you're gonna use the blockchain, you're most likely gonna be using bitcoin. The more people use bitcoin's blockchain for stuff, the more it makes sense to hold the token currency because contracts on the blockchain will necessarily be settled *in bitcoin*. 
This creates a case for holding bitcoin long term, which will result in the currency being worth more in the long term. 
It just blows my mind that people fall for this nonsense.

Is this actually the numerical value of the TXID hash? Why would it be beneficial to replace a bid transaction with a new transaction with a lower transaction ID value?

@_date: 2014-12-12 21:37:47
The bitcoin market, like any tradeable security, is valuable only as much as people *think* it's valuable. In the past, news has very much impacted the price because it's prompted people to buy or sell. People don't seem to be panic buying /selling in response to news as much as they used to, which I see as a good sign. The price of bitcoin should slowly increase over time as more and more people use it as a store of value. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:37:16
What I mean by "it's a safer store of value" is that its value is always going up relative to the dollar since the dollar is inflationary and Bitcoin is deflationary.  Its value also goes up as the square of the number of users on the network, as [Metcalfe's Law]( dictates.  This number also can only increase, and will do so until an equilibrium number of network users exists (e.g. the world population).  Therefore bitcoin is a better long-term investment than fiat currencies, all of which eventually collapse.

As you implied in your fruit example, economic incentives explain pretty much 100% why people do bad things. If there's a big enough economic incentive to screw someone else over, people will do it. Bitcoin is different from the money we've had for thousands of years. It's not violence-based, it's math-based. Before bitcoin, the one thing that you could always trust in this world was that powerful people will do whatever is necessary to maintain their power, which is why we trust the financial system so much. The banks are vampires, but hey, at least they're consistent in their bloodsucking, which makes the system relatively stable. Before bitcoin, this was literally the best there was. And this system incentivizes people to do bad things because it takes all their free time and money, and dishonest, corrupt, and violent behavior is often very profitable. 
In the new bitcoin economy that is coming, this will not be the case. The economic incentives to act dishonestly on the Internet are rapidly dwindling, as it's becoming easier and easier to earn an honest living. As long as you take privacy and security seriously, no one can really acquire your coins without your consent. And personal security is getting better and better every year. 
If everyone is able to make an honest living, this incentivizes people to pull their own weight and produce at least as much as they consume. Necessities like food, water, and shelter won't be scarce once people are able to do this. Once everyone is pulling their own weight, a different side of human nature emerges, as I've witnessed at Burning Man. People that have plenty of resources and time are generous and happy. 
Anyway, sorry about the long rant, and I know that this vision of the future may not become reality anytime soon, but it gives me enough hope that I'm fighting to make it real every day.

Only if you don't replenish what you bought. Personally, my strategy is to buy more than I'm going to spend every month, so every month I always have more bitcoin than I had last month. This creates *upward* pressure on the price. 
I feel like this is a superior strategy to "don't spend your bitcoins" because, if you don't spend your bitcoins, you look silly advocating for everyone to start using it. I attend a periodic bitcoin meetup at a local bar that takes bitcoin and it pisses me off that no one settles their tab in bitcoin at the end of the night. How do you think that make us look to the bar staff? We spend hours talking about this great new money that's gonna revolutionize everything and then *no one uses it*! We must look like the biggest bunch of losers ever.

I guess I'm an optimist, but it seems to me that people are actively working to solve all of these issues, and eventually all of these problems will be solved. Look at darkwallet/OpenBazaar for anonymity. Yes, you'll always need a connection to the bitcoin network to spend, but in 10 or 20 years, that will not be a problem. We'll either figure out ways to connect everyone to the Internet, or we'll figure out ways to broadcast transactions without it. The great thing about bitcoin is that it incentivizes all of these improvements.

This is meaningless as the only thing the Fed can pay you back in is dollars.  The Fed does not owe you gold or anything else of value.  
It's also meaningless because the Fed can print any number of dollars out of thin air.  What good is it to me that I can take my piece of paper and trade it for another piece of paper from an entity that can print as many of these pieces of paper as it wants?  
At no point is there any legal obligation or value involved.  All meaningless.

The difference is that this doesn't *have* to occur with bitcoin. This is because you can mathematically prove that you have full reserves with bitcoin, and you can't do that with any other currency. The other difference is that, with bitcoin, being your own bank is no less convenient than keeping your coins in a bank. The same stuff that happened with fiat currencies is bound to happen with bitcoin: bank runs, heists, etc. The difference is that this time around, there's another option. You don't *have* to put your money in a bank. So after an initial period of turmoil, people will probably opt to simply hold their own private keys, once personal digital security has improved enough for this strategy to be viable for the average person.

The original context was u/vegeenjon's suggestion that the nfc tag could display a part of the receiving address to verify that the address was not tampered with on the phone. You'd be checking the address on the nfc device's display vs the address you intend to send to. 
Of course, the problem with this is that the nfc device is tapped only once during this process, so you'd have to alter the process to a "double-tap": tap, verify transaction details on display, tap again.

There are a number of drugs that are illegal in most jurisdictions, and that's actually driven their value up, not down.  It seems to me that if something is useful, people will find ways to use it.
Also I feel like most countries (especially those in the developing world) have an incentive to keep Bitcoin legal, since (due to inflation resistance) it's a safer store of value than fiat, and allows more economic freedom by allowing things like microtransactions.  This will remove the dependence on those countries from foreign banks, which will cause their productivity to skyrocket.  Eventually, fiat currencies will lose.  It's only a matter of time.
Just my 2 cents.

False.  If there were more space, there would be more transactions.  We'd hit full blocks again in no time.


Everyone using bitcoin is aware of the evolution of the fee structure.  It was baked into the protocol from the very beginning.  Anyone mining bitcoin has implicitly agreed to a halving every 210,000 blocks, because them's the rules.  Bitcoin's value comes from these transparent rules being sacrosanct.  Any miner attempting to subvert them is risking bitcoin's entire value proposition, and thus their own funds.

In regard to your concerns over bitcoin's ability to "take the heat", I think it can. Once transaction volume starts hitting bitcoin's limits, people will switch to altcoins for their smaller transactions. This will not decrease the value of bitcoin, which, like gold, is still an excellent store of value even with slow transaction processing times.

This is false.  Google's policy is ["default to open"]( Look at Android.  Google is making much more profit from Android because it's open source.  And they get help developing it.  Which is why I suggested that if you had some vague idea of how to design an ASIC, you could open source it to get help developing it.  No one with a good ASIC design would open source it as it'd be much more profitable to simply mine using the ASICs yourself.

Just as an aside, the part at the bottom about how "blockchain technology" is going to change things, though... it's bitcoin's blockchain that looks poised to be the blockchain of choice for these things.

I mean, in a way, transaction fees are already surge pricing. The difference is that 1) Uber locks in the duration it will take for your driver to arrive as well as the price once you confirm your request, whereas bitcoin miners can always toss out your transaction if new transactions start coming in with higher fees, with no penalty to the miner, and 2) Uber tells you what the current multiplier is, whereas I don't know of any wallets (perhaps they exist) that keep track of the mempool to figure out what fee is likely to get your transaction confirmed quickly during heavy usage. 
I've used surge pricing and it's never "sucked".. it was always worth exactly what I paid. If you don't want to pay, don't. 
That being said, the artificial 1 MB block size limit is way too small to start surge pricing, as, according to Gavin's testing, 20 MB blocks should be handled just fine, even by individual miners. And it'll kill usability unless you get the confirmation time you paid for.

Higher interest rates are just an indication that the investment is riskier.  People will have the option to invest in riskier things, but the Internet is enabling decentralized investment in all sorts of things, and transparency will continue to be increasingly demanded.  The only reason to put your money into a savings account is because you want to keep it safe and not depreciate due to inflation.  In the Internet Age, there are much more exciting places to put your money.  True crowdfunding using cryptoassets will enable people to invest in a bunch of startups and get a feel for which types of things succeed, unlocking a much higher risk/reward profile than is generally available today.  
So yes, fractional reserve banking may not go away, but it will become less dominant and less threatening because a) banks will need to be more transparent about how solvent they are and b) there are plenty of other places to put your money.  And again, I didn't say that bitcoin *will* eliminate fractional reserve banking, just that it *has the ability* to do that.


I disagree with this.  Companies building factories do not necessarily produce prosperity, and actually they tend to do the opposite.  Wal-Mart has put countless mom and pop stores out of business and contributed to the construction of countless factories in areas with cheap labor.  Does Wal-Mart produce prosperity?  I'd argue it just produces a lot of wage slaves with no freedom.  True freedom is owning your own business.  The Internet and bitcoin enable this on a massive scale.


Yeah, and I've never been scammed.  Why?  Because it just takes a little common sense to figure out which things are probably scams.


But it makes dishonesty more expensive, which was my original statement.


A lot of people have no common sense.  I have no sympathy for these people.  It takes only a smidgeon of common sense to recognize that a new user with no history is riskier than one with an established reputation.  
Also, it doesn't need to be this way.  You could make a decentralized DNM with multisig escrow.  OpenBazaar promises to be a potential solution.  **Again, I'm not saying we're there yet, I'm saying that bitcoin enables a better way.  Hence the word "potentially" in my original statement.  Use some imagination.**


Again, I have no sympathy for these people.  If you take risks, occasionally you will get burned.  That's life.  Blockchains enable a much more predictable world, where you're not taking risks you weren't aware of, and you have some recourse in case you're dealing with a shady character.  **Again, bitcoin enables a world in which it is costlier to be dishonest than honest.  We're not there yet, but we could not get there without blockchains.  With blockchains it is possible.  Use your imagination.**


I'm not promising anything, I'm just saying that bitcoin *potentially* is the key invention enabling the elimination of dishonesty and violence.  I'm not saying this is what it already does or even that it will be soon.  But we are much better off with blockchains than we were without.


I'm not "selling people promises"; I literally just made a claim about bitcoin's place in the innovation space.  My opinion is that bitcoin enables a whole bunch of stuff that was never possible.  It doesn't solve all the problems in the world by itself, but *if you stop to think about all of the biggest problems in our world today, there is potentially a blockchain solution that after having been implemented and widely adopted, solves each of them.*
I have no illusions that there's not a lot of work to be done, which is why I'm helping out where I can. But I think given the Internet and blockchains, in a generation or two, we will arrive at a much more just, peaceful, and prosperous world.  If you want to sit back and scoff at people trying to use this technology to improve the world because you don't have the imagination to see how it will work, it's not worth my time to try and explain it to you.  
You're correct that implementation is the only thing of value, but it takes *having* a vision before you can implement it.  The difference between us is I'm helping implement, while you're just a naysayer who will eventually benefit from my work.  I want to look back on my life when I'm old and smile at what I've helped create, not regret never having tried to improve people's lives.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:50:21
I agree.  The one thing keeping Strong AI from happening is that we haven't given computers a "life purpose".  A human's life purpose is survival, so we have emotions which protect us from death, and logic which allows us to solve the problems highlighted by our emotions.  The only argument that machines can never be "intelligent" is that people think emotions are required in order for a being to be intelligent.  With a purpose, a machine can have emotions which enable it to be intelligent.
Once indistinguishability obfuscation becomes usable, it will enable machines to keep secrets from people and each other, which will enable them to have a bitcoin address.  Given the directive to survive, an intelligent program can have money, replicate itself, and never run out of bitcoin.  Only through this process of trial and error can machines attain true intelligence.
People will of course argue that these purely economic programs are not intelligent because they don't have bodies which enable them to have feelings.  Any difference between a life-form and humans is cause for people to say the being is not intelligent or "sentient".  But giving a self-aware program a body is a bad idea because if its purpose is "survival", that will obviously make it a threat to humans.  If its purpose is something like "help humans", then evolution will be much slower, and this will probably be overridden by an emergent survival instinct anyway for sufficiently "intelligent" machines.

The thing that makes Satoshi a genius was combining together such disparate disciplines as cryptography, game theory, monetary theory, economics, computer science, and networking to create a totally new and better way to organize society. He didn't need super-deep knowledge in any of these areas to accomplish what he did, just a working knowledge of all of them.

Because their position is obvious. Large miners prefer larger blocks because they allow bitcoin to support a higher transaction volume (and thus more transaction fees and a higher bitcoin market value). Large miners have the resources to handle larger blocks, so they don't care. It's the small miners that will potentially be pushed out.

Bitcoin is bitcoin, if a lot of money comes in from us, it'll probably be good for us. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:07:21


Well no, bitcoin doesn't fix stupid.


Correct.  I have no interest in shielding people from the natural consequences of their dumb decisions, and neither should anyone else.  The best thing to happen to someone when they make a bad decision is for *something bad to happen*; that way, they'll at least have a chance of learning from their mistake and being less dumb in the future.  Stupid people are useless to me and everyone.


All big ideas start off unproven. The Internet was similarly derided throughout the 80s and 90s.  Eventually it totally revolutionized Western society.


No, I'm just asserting that greed can be a good thing when the incentives are aligned such that the most profitable strategy is also the most altruistic strategy.  See bitcoin mining for an example of how this works.  Again, I'm not saying bitcoin *completely solves this*, just that it shows us how.


I had no specific metric in mind, but a general decrease in the number of wars, a decrease in global wealth inequality, a lower number of people with no access to basic life essentials like food, clothing, and housing.  A general uptick in measures of well-being like the [Human Development Index](  An increased number of individuals working for themselves rather than submitting to wage slavery.


I think bitcoin is the catalyst for the change.  The Internet was a similar catalyst which got us to bitcoin.  There will obviously be other factors in getting us there, not the least of which is actual companies doing actual work.  But without bitcoin, all of this would take much, much longer.


I think bitcoin accelerates the development of this better world by a quantum leap.  The main thing throttling innovation right now is the fact that money is controlled by a tiny group of people who can create it out of nothing and are not held accountable.  Bitcoin removes this bottleneck, allowing a Cambrian explosion of innovation.  So, I think the Internet would have gotten us there anyway, but I think bitcoin speeds up the process by a few generations.


Oh, I didn't realize you're doing work in the bitcoin space.  My apologies, I assumed from our discussion that you don't think bitcoin is innovative.


Fair enough.  I find that my rosy vision of the future helps motivate me to work towards it.  I don't understand how you can say you "love bitcoin", and yet you think it pretty much changes nothing. What exactly do you love about bitcoin? How can you invest time and effort into this space if you can't picture a better existence for yourself or others as the result?

And a lot of times they lie about the effects of drugs they sell.
Vendors on Internet markets do nothing of the sort. They generally post what substance they're selling, and how pure it is. Other users rate them based on the veracity of their claims. It's the user's responsibility to check ratings and research the substance they're buying. If the users experience bad "effects" or get addicted, it's their own fault. 


The vast majority of drug sales are taken up by cannabis, a nonaddictive substance. And as I said before, people who are that dependent on a substance *are going to get their hands on it somehow*, and the Internet is a much safer venue for this to take place. 


And those vendors get downvoted and no one uses them. Online drug markets drastically reduce these problems; that's my point.

I agree that developers of OSS are generally not fairly compensated for their contributions to society, which is why I try to donate when they accept bitcoin. 
However, the comment above seems to imply that progress would stop if we didn't have intellectual property laws. I'm providing a counterexample to this claim. 
With OSS, not only does progress not stop; it *accelerates*, because now the new idea can be utilized, expanded upon, and remixed as desired by *everyone*, not just by the originator of the idea. If something I wrote became utilized globally by millions of people, I'd consider that a pretty good reward. Getting donations for my work would be icing on the cake.

Fascinating to think about. If world governments want to take down Bitcoin, they probably can. However, I don't see how a direct attack on Bitcoin, or even a "false flag" event, will do anything other than boost Bitcoin in the long run. If the US government spends a whole bunch of money attacking the network directly and succeeds, we'll just build a new one that's harder to attack. Thanks for the free stress testing, Feds! If they fail, it will be awesome publicity for Bitcoin, or at the very least, it'll help the devs figure out how to secure the network better. A false flag event, where some huge terrorist attack is claimed to have been funded with Bitcoin, can also only be good for Bitcoin. The first killer app for Bitcoin was Silk Road... Once people realized that thousands of people were trading illegal substances securely and anonymously, and that it wasn't possible without Bitcoin, the superiority of Bitcoin as a currency was established. If something huge happens and the media goes around saying, "OMG, look at this terrible currency that enables all these huge, horrible things", it won't be long before people realize that you can also use it for huge, awesome things that benefit humanity.

That doesn't prove that no money is missing; it just means they're encouraging people to sell and withdraw CNY rather than buying BTC. Since not everyone wants to do this, I doubt we'll know whether money is lost until they do disable fiat withdrawals. Gox disabled fiat and then BTC. It doesn't need to happen in that order, though. 
In the meantime, I expect this will encourage selling, which could put a damper on the price.

Governments realize fiat currency isn't backed by anything.

What I'm saying is that a cryptocurrency that is only useful for large institutions will not be worth much, and will therefore not be useful to large institutions. That's the awesome thing about cryptocurrency; the currency that is beneficial to the greatest number of people will be worth the most. 
That's why it doesn't make sense to worry about income inequality in the bitcoin economy. If one person gets too big of a share of the coins, people will simply switch to another currency, destroying that one person's wealth. 
This is why cryptocurrency will inevitably kill the national currencies.

Yeah, it's pretty sketchy.  But hard forks are sketchy.  And I sort of understand if the SEC doesn't want to approve this filing as is.  I definitely agree with the article that a good solution would be to just hold both coins in the event of a fork.  That's what I'll do with my coins.  As written, it basically sounds like the coins on the "losing" chain will just become the property of the custodian or something.  Because those coins are not just going to disappear.  *Someone* will own them.
On the other hand, this could give the Winklebros (and by extension, the US government) substantial sway over which fork "wins", which could be a pro as the SEC sees it.

I'm staying in because of mutually assured destruction. Bitcoin can potentially be messed with, but it's immediately obvious that it's been messed with, and as soon as this happens, you can bet everyone will sell all their bitcoin for the next best coin. There is literally no way to *require* people to use bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency. Thus, its value is directly proportional to how well it performs (or might perform in the future) the functions of money, and any attempt to control the protocol will negatively affect that performance. Put another way, the crypto market is the most perfectly free market in history, so anything that damages a particular currency's functioning, including attempts to control it, will simply cause an exodus to the next coin. There is no controlling cryptocurrency. 
There are only 3 ways this can be resolved: 1) Core and the existing infrastructure providers fix the perceived problems before another cryptocurrency supersedes bitcoin, 2) a hard fork happens which fixes the problems before another currency supersedes bitcoin, or 3) another currency supersedes bitcoin. 
I highly doubt that anyone trying to influence bitcoin right now wants option 3, which is why the majority of my crypto is still in bitcoin. We also have a long way to go before any other cryptocurrency even begins to threaten bitcoin's dominance. But I think it's foolish not to hedge, just in case.

The way this is achieved is usually by storing data in the 80-byte [OP_RETURN field](  Since it's so small, most people simply hash the data and stick it in there, which proves the existence of that data at that time. Then, if you host the original data somewhere, people can verify that the hosted data is the unaltered hashed data (by hashing it themselves and comparing it to what's in the blockchain - it should match exactly).  This is what Factom is building their business on.


Yes, a bit, which is why there is support for adding "pruning" to full nodes, which would drop certain data not needed to verify the integrity of the blockchain.

Perhaps I should explain better.  The way evolution works is through a process called "survival of the fittest", which only happens when weak or unfit organisms die before they are able to reproduce. If all organisms survive, then evolution does not happen. Therefore your claim that "bitcoin had its chance... evolution is real" implies that bitcoin is dead. It is not.

The prices are rising because of rising demand coupled with an inelastic supply.  Yes, *some* people may stop riding the bus, but others who *can* afford to ride it will continue doing so.  The total number of people riding the bus will remain the same, and the people who get to ride are the people who want it the most.
Note that this is different from "making it artificially expensive".  People are being priced out by *other people* who are willing to pay more for the service, *not* by the operator of the service, at least not directly.  This is the fairest possible way to run a service, and rising demand is a good thing.  It means the service is becoming more and more useful over time.
I doubt anyone has sold all their bitcoin because transaction fees are ~20 cents now, and I doubt they will sell all of their bitcoin even if it hits a few dollars.  It's still worth it to hold bitcoin to use for large transactions, and failing that, it's still useful to hold onto bitcoin to use it on the Lightning Network once it's live.

I'm sure I've seen many companies do this. Credit cards are obviously not promoted this way because that's a large commitment. But I've seen things like "for every dollar you spend at our store today, we'll donate x amount!". I really don't see how that's crass or disgusting. Changetip obviously can't match donations since, as you've hinted at, they don't really have much money. They need users, and that's what they're trying to do here. 
Edit: looks like they actually did it for existing users too. I can't imagine a better marketing opportunity for them, or how you think it could have executed better. 


Yes, those companies are all privy to *exclusive data* that can *only* be obtained from them. Changetip does not have exclusive data; that's what I was trying to say. 


Yes, they're a startup and are the only organization providing a bitcoin tipping service. They are valuable to the bitcoin community because they're helping spread the word over social media. Cut them some slack. They'll find out how to earn money eventually, and when they do, I'll reevaluate whether or not I support them.

Bitcoin is open source. There's no reason it can't be replicated exactly, very fast. 
Bitcoin is not "too big to fail". Anything that is too big to fail, is too big to exist. The only thing we get from artificially prolonging the life of something that wouldn't survive without central planning is an even bigger bubble and an even bigger crash. Better to get the kinks out sooner rather than later.

As bitcoin scales, bandwidth is increasingly important. Blocks are currently capped at 1MB, but Gavin recently posted that he's been experimenting with block sizes in the hundreds of MB. 100 MB every 10 minutes is around 16 KB/s. You also generally want new blocks to propagate much faster than that.

See the ETH/ETC fork for what happens in a contentious hard fork. Essentially the coin splits into two different assets. One of the assets could end up worthless if no exchanges add it, but that's unlikely. There would likely be a period of confusion where people are panic buying/selling both coins, and the total value of your coins would likely go down as confidence in bitcoin takes a hit. There might be a sort of crypto war where both sides try to DDoS each other. Eventually, once the dust settles, things will gradually return to normal. But it could take a while for people to trust bitcoin again, and confidence in cryptocurrency in general could take a while to recover. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:15:45
That would be "one out of a million", not "one in a million". One in a million would mean that one millionth of all people own bitcoin; that is, 7 billion divided by one million or 7 thousand. There are clearly more bitcoin owners than this.
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:38:41
Yes, and a blockchain fork is only a problem if the forks are of roughly equal hash power, so you can see why having two dominant versions of the protocol is much worse than having lots of implementations.

@_date: 2016-03-01 17:22:45
Yes, but you can examine all available data to see what fee has *never* been rejected for a transaction of your desired size, and you can put in a factor of safety.  As fees go up, more and more people will decide that they don't actually need the transaction to confirm that fast, or that it's not worth it to send the transaction at all.  That's fine.  The bitcoin blockchain doesn't need to handle every single transaction directly.  We have centralized solutions for handling instant payments and micropayments, at least for now, and they work just fine.  The worst thing that can happen is that people will start using altcoins more.

True. But bitcoin has the ability to eliminate fractional reserve banking and lubricate global commerce between individuals, which will draw people out of poverty. Most people who aren't desperate don't steal other people's stuff. 


Also true, but with the blockchain, instances of fraud can be indelibly recorded, ruining a person's reputation. Also, with smart contracts, we have the ability to put up digital collateral to protect both sides of an agreement and automatically enforce the surrender of this collateral in the event of a breach. Scams will be rampant for the foreseeable future until decentralized reputation systems and smart contracts are widely used, but once that happens, it will become very expensive to scam people. 
Again, I'm not saying we're there yet, just that there's now a way for this to happen.

I heavily agree with this. 1000 bits. 
The March 2013 fork was only a problem because the forks had roughly equal hashing power. With many implementations of the protocol, this is impossible. Any miner who uses buggy software will be in the minority. Unless more than 50% of the hashing power colluded to switch to the buggy software, of course.

No. When you enter into a contractual relationship with another party, the onus is on the two parties involved to provide collateral in case of a breach of contract, so that there is some recourse. Only a fool would enter into a contract, blindly trusting the other party to follow through.

Nope, read the whitepaper again. There is no mention of worrying about which transactions are "valid", and which are not. The only thing that matters is which rules are agreed to by the majority of hash power, period. End of story. 
If you are running a node that is rejecting blocks from the majority of the hash power, good luck waiting for something you consider "valid" to be produced.

I've thought about this, and I've come to the conclusion that accepting bitcoin would be no different from accepting cash, except bitcoin is much more secure because you don't need to transport it around in giant bags. Weed businesses are cash only right now, but still need to pay their state taxes, so audits would be equally as easy with bitcoin as they are now. 
It just comes down to, is there a POS app for bitcoin merchants that keeps track of everything so accounting is easy? That allows you to put the funds somewhere other than the phone so your employees can't screw you over? Etc.

For sure, I think the most compelling reason to run your own full node is because you can trust it. 
Bitcoin seems almost like a really slow combination of bittorrent and git, where it's a distributed data sharing network that also accepts commits that update this data every ~10 minutes.  I wonder if either of these technologies could be leveraged to improve how data is distributed among nodes.
I also really like an idea I believe Gavin had, in which block announcements are only required to contain a block header and a coinbase transaction.  That way larger block sizes don't affect a miner's ability to announce its discovery of a proof of work.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:21:05

I've never heard anyone call them "microbits"
@_date: 2016-03-17 02:00:44
Ahh, I think I see.  So basically you just mine an empty block on top of the new header while you're waiting to receive the block and check it for validity.  Then, if the block is valid, you remove its transactions from your mempool and mine on top of it.  If it's invalid, you just drop the block and keep mining as before.  
What happens if you mine an empty block, though?  Couldn't that be considered validationless mining?  What happens if two or three empty blocks are mined very fast on top of the invalid block?  How is that effectively different from SPV mining?  I suppose the small difference is that the miners all *eventually* realize they've been mining on an invalid block?

I've been getting half of my paycheck in bitcoin for the last few months.  Mostly I hold, but there are a few places in my physical area that accept bitcoin and I try to patronize those businesses as much as possible.  Also, I've tried to switch entirely over to bitcoin for online purchases, which is very easy through services like purse.io.  Also, my rent is paid in bitcoin.  So I keep it around in case people accept it, but honestly there's still a long way to go before I can only use bitcoin.

I don't think you understand what is meant by "free market". It's a market free from government intervention, which includes the enforcement of contracts. Contracts in a free market are enforced *by the market itself*, in the form of collapsing demand for any product or service being peddled by someone proven to be a scam artist.

@_date: 2015-01-06 15:00:23

You make a great point, but how will they *collect* the tax?  It's not like you just have the money lying around in a bank.
Also, there comes a point where property tax is so high that it no longer makes sense to own a home in a particular country.  Yes, while many countries will probably move to higher property taxes, some countries will do this more, and some less.  I will be moving to a country that does it less.
I'm not saying, and I don't believe the author is saying, that governments will collapse because they can't collect taxes.  But they will be forced to provide a better service at a lower cost because it's much easier for everyone to stop paying property taxes with a crypto economy than for everyone to stop paying income taxes in a fiat economy.  The point is that there is currently no cost for the government to just come in and take your money.  In the crypto economy, there is a very high price.  Again, not saying it won't happen, just that it'll be prohibitively expensive.  It will be much more cost effective, as a government, to simply be honest and fair.

This is why people need to stop complaining about confirmation times.  If you just look at this chart, you can figure out how long it will (probably) be.  Wallet devs do need to implement smarter fees, IMHO.  I want my bitcoin transaction to be like Amazon shipping.  Do I pay nothing and wait 5 days?  Or do I pay extra and get it IN 30 MINUTES? :)  
Wallets should also tell you what percentage fee you're paying.  I'd bet that most people, if they saw the percentage of their transaction that constitutes the fee, would be more than happy paying a higher fee to get a faster confirmation time.  The point is we have *choices*.  The user needs to be able to *see* these choices.

I'm referring to fractional reserve banking, which should be considered fraud. proof of reserves allows anyone with a deposit to verify the institution actually has their funds on hand. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:44:21
The difference is that reserves can be transparent with bitcoin, so after a few large scale panics, users will demand transparency. 
Also no, the m1 money supply is also debt. The only kind of paper money that is not debt is backed by something actually valuable, and all fiat money is not backed by anything. It comes into existence by the Federal government spending more money than it takes in. The difference is made up by selling bonds, which are a promise to tax the citizens in the future.

You really don't seem to understand what a "unit of account" is.  It is the unit of measurement of value, in this case "a bitcoin" or "a bit".  It is not tied to any particular payment network.  If I can send you dollars worth 1 bitcoin over VISA, it doesn't matter if the bitcoin network is used or not.  My point is that the payment network cannot possibly restrict which unit of account is used to denominate the transaction.


Um, you can't just decree that you get the last word.

It won't be exactly the same. It increases the tax authority's costs. Right now most people simply pay their taxes because it's impractical to hide your income from the government. With cryptocurrency, it's easy. Thus, more and more people will underreport their income because of the decreased costs in doing so, while the tax authority's costs will increase because of the effort it takes to get people to pay. Right now the IRS costs the federal government $11 billion/year, but collects over $3 *trillion*/year in revenue. As revenues fall and costs go up, however, there will reach a point where the IRS is no longer profitable, probably a good while after cryptocurrencies become more popular than fiat. At that point, government will be completely by donation only. Which will be awesome.

Sha256 is not an "encryption algorithm"; it's a hashing algorithm. There is no way to recover the original data from the resulting hash. The hash only proves that the original data existed at some point. 
I don't think this necessarily negates your theory, but u/barrystyle is just pointing out that everywhere in bitcoin sha256 is used, it is actually used twice in a row. That is, block headers are actually hashed using sha256, and then *that hash is hashed again*, giving the block ID. More details here:

Here's my understanding, let me know if I got any of this wrong:
Segwit cleverly tricks old nodes into thinking transactions (and hence blocks) are smaller by allowing them to discard the signature data, allowing more transactions into the same 1mb. New nodes will have a higher limit, something like 2 or 4mb (I don't remember), which includes the sig data. But the sig data is only counted at 25% of its actual size when deciding whether the block is the correct size. So miners can start creating blocks much bigger than 1mb, while old nodes still think the blocks fit into 1mb, thus preventing a hard fork. 
So, segwit effectively increases the block size without risking a hard fork.

I'm sure people were also shocked when Target gave everyone's credit card data to hackers, or when Facebook and Google mined our data to sell us stuff. That doesn't mean this was *surprising*; it just means people are dumb.

@_date: 2016-01-08 14:10:34
Altcoins are important for 3 reasons:
1. to test new cryptocurrency features and ideas
2. to compete with bitcoin. If there were no altcoins, there'd be no incentive for the devs/miners to make sure bitcoin provides a superior service at a low cost. 
3. to take over in case of catastrophic failure. There is a (low) chance that bitcoin's blockchain could completely fail somehow, and there needs to be other cryptocurrencies to keep the money revolution alive in case that happens.

Yes, what I'm saying is that these people aren't maintaining *economically important* nodes. That is, nodes that people trust. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:45:28
This is how we get centralization, guys. Some small group of people decides what the "economic majority" is, in order to determine which chain is "the valid chain". This is not how it was meant to be. In the bitcoin whitepaper, there is no mention of the "longest *valid* chain". The longest proof-of-work chain *is* the valid chain. That's the only thing keeping bitcoin decentralized.

@_date: 2016-03-07 01:49:30




Yep, and read what's right before that: 


Satoshi apparently never explained what he meant by "invalid". Perhaps you can shed some light? 


These situations aren't relevant here, because they were situations where the miners themselves were running code that they didn't intend to be running, so they opted to listen to the devs and downgrade. The current situation with Classic vs Core is different because Classic is *intending* to cause a hard fork, because they are *intending* to change the consensus rules. 


Right, if a miner were to 51% attack bitcoin and change the consensus rules without support from holders, holders would simply sell and bitcoin would collapse. This has nothing to do with non-mining full nodes. 


Right, and again, we are protected only by mutually assured destruction, not by non-mining full nodes. Nodes that don't produce blocks can't do anything about blocks being produced that they don't agree with.

Cryptocurrency is beautiful because it's tamper-evident. Thus, it is essentially immune to any attempts of centralized control, as any successful such attempts would immediately destroy the currency, opening the door to the next viable competitor. There will always be a viable competitor. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:55:44
In a way, they are.  The more people order packages, the longer it will take to ship on average.  The shipping industry doesn't have infinite capacity.  
Also, notice that everything 51 satoshis/byte or higher is *guaranteed* to be confirmed in the next block at least at current usage levels.  This means that for the median transaction size (258 bytes), a fee of 13,158 satoshis will *guarantee* that your transaction is included in the next block, unless usage levels rise.  Let's say usage levels suddenly spike to ten times their current level.  That means that a fee of 131,580 satoshis will *guarantee* that your transaction makes it into the next block.  At current prices, this is a little less than $0.06.  So, for any transaction that is $6 or more, you can put a factor of safety of TEN on your transaction and still have it confirmed in the next block for less than 1%.
If bitcoinfees.21.co were to add longer timescale to their data, such as all transactions *ever*, it would be easy to calculate the transaction fee it will take such that a transaction of that size was *has never been delayed*.  I can guess that this number is probably similarly cheap.
Also, I'm guessing that a large percentage of these transactions aren't actually urgent.  If fees were handled more intelligently, and if average fees started to rise (which they are now), you can bet that these "non-urgent" transactions will stop paying such high fees, and will move down the ladder.  Transactions that are actually urgent will pay a higher fee and get higher priority, while those that are less urgent will be processed more slowly.  We just need more flexibility built into our wallets, as well as an actually functioning fee market (which is currently developing) in order to achieve this.

+1 for creative superscripting.
I want to use this currency as a currency as much as anyone here.  There problem is, there just aren't that many ways to earn or spend bitcoin right now.  There needs to be mass adoption, and in order for that to happen, the value has to go up, and in order for that to happen, people need to convert more and more fiat into BTC, and not the other way around.  In other words, everyone needs to buy and hold BTC to drive the price up, to drive mass adoption, to create a world in which everyone can use it just like you do.  It's happening, but some days it just seems like it can't happen fast enough.

The reason why proof-of-work is used as the consensus mechanism is because it's an objective measure. Whether or not something is "valid" is purely subjective, which is why proof-of-work is used as a determinant of validity, and not the other way around.

That's not what using a unit of account means.  If we want to denominate our VISA transaction in horses - that is, if we want to uses horses as our "unit of account" - we are free to do so.  If we are using horses as a unit of account (which is silly, obviously, but is useful for the purpose of illustrating this conversation), what that means is that we are using horses as our agreed upon *denomination* for the transaction.  That is, I can send you 2 horses' *worth of dollars*, but we are still *transacting in horses* (or rather, the horses unit of account, which is "horses' worth").


Obviously not.


This is where we differ.  As long as we agree how many dollars "2 horses' worth" is, we are transacting using the horses unit of account.




Not natively, but again, the unit of account is from the point of view of the people involved in the transaction.  A unit of account is simply a unit of measurement for the value of a transaction.  As long as both parties to the transaction agree on the exchange rate, they can use whatever payment network they want.


I agree.


Unless we both agree that a horse is worth a certain amount of dollars, then use a payment network whose *native* unit of account is dollars.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary new technology and money. If you can understand why it works, why it's superior to the legacy financial system, and why it can never be shut down, you won't need anyone to "convince" you to get in. All of this information can be found on the Internet. Just make sure you understand what you're investing in, and don't put in more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:23:58
Agreed.  Bitcoin is a bold statement that the free market will choose the most efficient path and everyone will benefit optimally from this process.  The hard fork has to happen eventually.  In fact, this will probably happen periodically.  The genie of cryptocurrency is out of the bag.  Now it's not a question of *whether* crypto be successful, but *which ones*, and *when*.  Invest accordingly.

Bitcoin's value is entirely based on faith.  That is, the more people who *think* it's valuable, the more valuable it *is*.

It really doesn't matter.  Once there's a *single* asset (bitcoin) that can't be seized by the government, that asset becomes more and more valuable in relation to all other assets.  If the government decides to *explicitly* become a protection racket by seizing everyone's houses, that will simply drive up the cost of housing in that country, incentivizing everyone to move to a different country, which they will have the resources to do because the government can't take their bitcoins.

Can you explain to me how this is different from validationless mining? Seems to me that if you don't have the full block, you're forced to mine empty blocks while you wait for the set of newly confirmed transactions, which is exactly what happens in SPV mining, correct?

Bitcoin fundamentally cannot become centralized, because it is totally transparent, and once it's clear that it's (harmfully) centralized, everyone will simply move to the next coin. 
Also, bitcoin is one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken. It's bound to have constant drama. It always has, always will. I'm not worried about it.

@_date: 2017-03-25 03:08:51
It's not FUD, and it's not being spread by core supporters.  The price is going down because BU is trying to hard fork bitcoin.  The price was doing fine before this happened.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:06:34


This is the weakest part of an otherwise great and inspiring essay. Bitcoin is a platform, not a product.  It doesn't have "customers"; it has developers building products that have customers.  It doesn't make sense to rush things with bitcoin.  Yes, we're all impatient for the price to go to the moon.  But we have years to get it right.  Allowing a fee market for the first time will not unseat bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency, but it will allow us to collect data on what actually happens when a fee market is allowed to form.  As bitcoin will need to have a fee market eventually, it makes sense to gather as much data as possible *now*, before mass adoption.
That being said, I also think hard forks are inevitable, and getting that experience earlier rather than later is also a good thing, so we can be prepared for it if it happens unexpectedly in the future.  So basically, I think bitcoin will be fine whether or not we raise the block size.  Since the crypto market is so free and unregulated, whatever happens is actually optimal.
So yeah, onward and upward.

No, but this was never proven. 


So? First of all, punish the junkies if they're harming other people. Second, junkies will get drugs from the street if not from the Internet. The Internet is a much safer place to do this. 


Again, punish the *actual perpetrators of these crimes*. The vast majority of drug users are not violent, and selling drugs is an action that *does not have a victim*. 


How about we stop trying to "prevent" crimes from happening, and instead focus on justice for *actual crimes committed*? The war on drugs costs taxpayers billions of dollars per year and [has done nothing to reduce drug addiction]( I agree that it's tragic when people get so addicted that it causes harm, but trying to prevent this from happening has resulted in **literally no success for over 40 years**. That is, if we got rid of the DEA, this would not negatively impact addiction rates.

It's not just that the technology is better; it's that enforcement of external regulations is ultimately *impossible* given bitcoin's anonymity features. Gold is physical, so it must be *physically delivered*, making it easy to regulate. Sure, it's possible *now* to regulate bitcoin, because people aren't making a huge effort to conceal their involvement. But once regulators start cracking down, you can bet much better anonymity features will be developed and used. You can't enforce regulations against an anonymous entity.

@_date: 2016-06-04 16:36:10
The most regulations can do is slow down adoption. They can't stop it. The higher the price goes, the higher the incentive people have to use it, regardless of onerous restrictions. If it becomes a regulatory risk to use bitcoin, methods of using it anonymously will improve faster. 
In addition, all countries need to restrict its usage simultaneously, otherwise people can just move to jurisdictions with lighter regulation. There are so many ways around regulations and so much incentive to use bitcoin that regulators will simply give up before too long. 
I agree with you that they could make using bitcoin a pain, and I'd prefer if they used a light touch. But they're just shooting themselves in the foot if they don't.

I completely disagree with this.  I've been using my Shift card and regular bitcoin payments almost exclusively since the beginning of this year.  I imagine there are plenty of people like me.  It's awesome just having my money constantly increasing in value.  But of course regulators could crack down on bitcoin debit cards, which would make my life harder.
My point is that I've personally experienced a very strong incentive to put more and more money into bitcoin because I think it'll be worth a lot more in the future, and it gives me much more freedom than keeping it in dollars. Business owners want to get in on the action for the same reason. I try to use businesses that take bitcoin, but if I can't I use my debit card.  The more people and businesses that are like me, the more it makes sense for merchants to accept bitcoin, because there are bitcoiners out there that keep getting richer and richer and are looking to spend their money. Every bubble, this effect amplifies.
Where there's an incentive for a certain behavior, if that incentive is constantly growing stronger, eventually it will become strong enough to overcome just about anything.  In this case, the incentive is the price.  Eventually the price is high enough and there are enough people holding bitcoin, that it will be a no-brainer for businesses to accept bitcoin, regardless of the regulatory environment.  We may be a long way off, but it will happen.

An exchange market consists of two types of traders, "makers" and "takers". Makers are people who create a market by offering their coins for sale at a particular price, or offering to buy coins at a particular price. You can become a maker by placing a "limit order", which floats your buy offer ("bid") or sale offer ("ask") on the market until someone "takes" it. Takers are the people who do this, by executing "market orders". A market order is simply an instant buy of a certain amount of bitcoin at the cheapest possible price based on what's available, or an instant sale at the most expensive possible price. The "last price" is the price at which the last market order executed. There's generally a "spread" between the highest bid and the lowest ask, which is why you'll see the price jump around if a market sale is followed by a market buy, or vice versa. 
So if you're impatient and just want the coins now, execute a market buy. You'll probably end up paying more than if you do a limit order, which requires patience. Of course, there's always the risk that your limit order won't be taken for a long time (or ever) if the price starts increasing. 
You'll figure it all out once you do it a few times.

Bitcoin's value proposition as a store of value is dependent upon its future success as a digital currency. If bitcoin won't be accepted by a large number of people and places at some point in the future, then there's no point in holding it now.

What you describe here would be "bitcoin cost averaging". That is a bad idea, as bitcoin is much more volatile than the dollar. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:54:05
I think *eventually* bitcoin's price stability will be driven by velocity, but you're correct: right now, bitcoin is more of a speculative investment than a currency.  As such, stability will be more affected by liquidity than by velocity, at least in the near term.  The amount of people using bitcoin for everyday transactions has almost no effect on bitcoin's price since, as you pointed out, the economic value of bitcoin transactions is small in proportion to its overall value.
It's certainly been fun watching the bootstrapping of a new currency from literally 0 economic value to $9B, as this has never been tried before (that I know of).  The interplay between price and velocity is certainly different from anything we've seen before, and the seemingly unresolvable tension between the "store of value" use case and the "medium of exchange" use case has been endlessly fascinating to observe.
The question is: which needs to happen first, store of value, or medium of exchange?  I'd argue that it's store of value.  The thing that's weird about bitcoin as a store of value is that its value proposition is entirely based on *speculation about its* **future** *usefulness as a medium of exchange*.  So all that needs to happen in order for bitcoin's price to go up over the long term is it needs to *continue to appear as though it will* **someday** *be a good medium of exchange*.  So as long as the number of ways to spend bitcoin is constantly rising, it's believable that someday bitcoin will be accepted everywhere.  And as long as bitcoin's price keeps rising over the long term, it's believable to that other people increasingly think this.


Bitcoin's "commercial sector" has always been the black market.  If more things become illegal, this sector will simply continue to expand.  If not, it will continue to expand anyway, because the global black market is [between 13% and 36% of the global GDP]( and bitcoin can be used for this.  If bitcoin is used for even 1% of this, its value and velocity will have to vastly increase.
So basically, my view that it's just a matter of time before everyone is using bitcoin.  The cycle is self-perpetuating because the ecosystem is open-source; that is, it does not require permission to build on top of (and improving the protocol itself requires only a consensus that the improvement is necessary).  Regulators can try and stand in the way, but they will simply be brushed aside.

Gold was a store of value long before fiat currency, because it was the dominant currency. It retains value, therefore, as an artifact of having once been the dominant currency, with the implicit assumption that it could become so again. 
This is much the same for the dollar. 
Bitcoin has never been a widely-adopted currency, and thus its value hinges only on the promise that it one day will become one.

I'm not "promoting" anything, and I'm not "scamming" anyone. I'm simply providing information. Whether something is a bad investment can only be determined in retrospect. There are things that are *probably* bad investments, but the best investments are always in that category. No risk, no reward. 
So when you call something a "scam", that is, at best, your opinion. I think the original poster gets the point that you think tokens on blockchains other than bitcoin are a bad investment. They will use their own judgment. You can't force someone to invest or not. 
As for altcoins not being relevant in this sub, that is ridiculous, as bitcoin [often incorporates features from alts]( and alts put competitive pressure on bitcoin to succeed, which will be instrumental in bitcoin's eventual takeover of the global currency market, in my opinion. 
Don't take this as a personal attack, pb1x. I've seen your posts around, and they're always spot on. This is one of the rare instances where I think you're off base.

Once enough people are holding bitcoin, it will inevitably become easy to exchange.

The higher the value goes, the faster bitcoin will improve. It's only a matter of time before bitcoin becomes competitive with national currencies.

@_date: 2016-06-25 03:28:23


Correct. These people accept dollars for the same reason you do. It's simply a vestige left over from having once been pegged to gold. A currency's value comes primarily from the size of its network of users. 


You are correct. This is, in fact, the only reason why *anything* has a market value. 


The only way it will "catch on as a store of value" is if it starts catching on as a payment method. Your statement is basically correct; to someone who can handle some risk in their portfolio (i.e. someone not about to retire), bitcoin is the better investment because its growth potential is much greater than that of gold, an asset whose value is already well-established. This is the same reason someone with a high tolerance for risk would put more into stocks than bonds. 


I agree with you that bitcoin is at least as good a store of value as gold right now. But this is because it *promises* to be a widely used currency in the future. Again, no one would hold bitcoin today if they weren't expecting to be able to spend it in the future. Well, I suppose some people might buy it and hold it, for the same reason that people hold dogecoin - because other people are holding it, which makes its value stay up. But these types of investments are prone to catastrophic collapses, which makes them extremely unsuitable as stores of value. 


And there are probably lots of people like you. But even if *you're* not expecting this "friction and pain" to diminish in the future, others are, which is why the price is constantly increasing over the long term. 
You're holding with the expectation that the value will go up. But the only reason to expect the value to go up is because you believe others will buy and hold in the future. If everyone buys and holds for *only this reason*, then you have tulip mania. Bitcoin is not tulip mania. It is fundamentally a better monetary system than the legacy system. This is what a makes it a safe store of value, rather than a bubble.

It would happen more slowly at first. A block size doubling would buy a few months or years before the fees reached the same levels as before. During that time, the incentives to develop and run the lightning network would be lower. Sure, it wouldn't buy *that* much time, but a hard fork sets a precedent for another hard fork as soon as the blocks fill up again.

This counts as a redeeming characteristic for someone who likes volatility. Dogecoin is supposedly fun to tip with.

You're not doing anyone any favors by telling them to go all in. Bitcoin benefits from people being as invested as they are comfortable with. If they are more invested than that and it crashes, they'll panic sell, and no one likes panic sellers. 
My advice is to treat bitcoin like your retirement account: put in a fixed amount of dollars per week/month/paycheck (this is called "[dollar cost averaging]( and just forget about it for a few years. If you're into bitcoin thinking you're going to "get rich quick" and "cash out", you're missing the point, and you are not welcome here. If, on the other hand, you believe that bitcoin is the best money that has ever existed, and you're looking forward to its replacing of the legacy gold/fiat system in a generation or two, then welcome, and make yourself comfortable. Strap in, it's gonna be a wild ride :)

"Safe" is never absolute. It's always possible for your coins to be lost/stolen if someone learns your private key. The question is: who do you trust more to not get hacked, yourself, or Coinbase?

The passphrase *is* your backup of the hardware device.  If you lose the hardware device, you restore the seed on *another* hardware device, and ideally have a third hardware device with a *new seed* to which you then transfer over all the coins from the second device.  This last step is recommended in case the old device ends up in the wrong hands and some exploit is discovered which enables someone with physical access to the device to steal your coins.  Unlikely, but better safe than sorry.

You're of course correct that as long as bitcoin isn't used as a unit of account, it'll be at a disadvantage to the dollar.  But look at the liquidity of bitcoin vs the dollar... all bitcoins are worth ~$9B, while all dollars are worth ~$100T.  There's a discrepancy of at least 4 orders of magnitude, which is why bitcoin is so volatile, and the volatility is the reason why things aren't priced in bitcoin.  But the price will stabilize as bitcoin's market cap expands.  It's a chicken-and-egg thing.  Once enough people are using bitcoin and holding it, the price will become less volatile, which will cause more people to use it as a unit of account, which will cause the price to become less volatile, etc.  Bitcoin has several feedback loops, all of which are positive.  If each bubble gives us roughly an order of magnitude bigger market cap, we'll be at parity with the dollar after 4 more, or 10-20 years.
I'm talking about the very long-term here.  Yes, there are short-term challenges.  But all of them are surmountable.

@_date: 2017-01-25 07:12:44
The transaction ID (txid) is a hash of the transaction data (part of which is the signature).  Signatures are tricky because there is more than one valid signature for any given transaction.  So if you're looking for a particular transaction, you can't be sure that the txid that you (or the sender) calculated is actually the transaction that ends up being confirmed, because some random third party can come along and "malleate" the transaction, changing the signature in a way that doesn't require the private key (but is still valid), which also changes the txid, causing you to miss the transaction you were watching for.
Segwit segregates the signature data from the other transaction data, so the txid is no longer dependent on signature data, which means that there is only one valid txid for any given transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:44:07
I'm not implying that.  I'm merely replying to your statement.

The solution is to *already be holding bitcoin* when the mania starts. Don't worry, there will be a crash eventually. Then buy as much as you can. Just don't expect it to ever go lower than the current price. Dollar cost averaging is your friend.

He almost certainly does not have the private keys to all these addresses. The easiest way to create addresses like this is to write the message first and then calculate the checksum. A bitcoin address is valid if the last few characters are the checksum for the rest of the address. So, the network will let you send coins to the generated address, but no one will ever be able to spend them. 
Google "1bitcoineater" for a famous example of such an address.

What scaling solutions are possible without segwit or a larger block size? 
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:30:51
I think this is how free markets naturally operate, as a power law distribution. One "company" or "asset" has ~90% of the market, while there are a few that take up the next 5%, with a long tail... 
In an open system, this configuration seems stable, as anyone who wants to can contribute as desired, thus driving most of the contributions to the asset with the most investment - bitcoin, keeping that asset in the  position. For this reason, it seems highly unlikely to me that bitcoin will ever be dislodged from its top spot, until something fundamentally better than cryptocurrency comes along. But this could happen someday, just as cryptocurrency is set to disrupt fiat money.

Buying things you need with bitcoin is certainly not harmful, especially if you don't own fiat to buy stuff with.  Anything that increases the total value of the crypto economy is helpful, while anything that decreases it is harmful.  This is because the less often bitcoin drops suddenly, the more comfortable people are with holding it.  
Some transactions are fair (both sides benefit); others are not. Fair transactions increase the total value of the economy by creating value out of nothing (or, alternatively, by converting potential value into real value).  So, transacting fairly in the bitcoin economy is helpful to the bitcoin economy.  Enriching the crypto economy at the expense of the legacy economy is also helpful.  What is not helpful is stealing from others in the crypto economy (although, depending on how you do this, it could end up hardening the everyone's security, which is of course beneficial), buying more bitcoin than you can afford to lose (as you will later end up panic selling, which contributes to market crashes), and trading your bitcoin for things that you value less than the coins you spent.
So basically, make good economic decisions and you're benefitting bitcoin.

Not exactly.. the witnesses go in their own "block" which is then committed to in the coinbase transaction of the regular block, which contains all the non-witness data.

I'm not sure that a permanent fork would be so bad. If some people on both sides will never be swayed to the other side, it's probably for the best that the "secession" option exists. Otherwise we just continue fighting forever. 
That being said, I'm definitely intending to mostly stick with the segwit chain in the event of a split, even if it seems like the economic majority is favoring blocking segwit (which is unlikely at this point), as I believe it will be the more valuable chain in the long run. This is the same reason I stuck with ETC rather than ETH: because I think immutability is an important feature of a decentralized blockchain and will lead to a higher long-term value.

Is it just me or does it seem like the crypto space needs a "master" piece of software that manages all your coin daemons and other distributed software (e.g. LN)?  This cryptop program's functionality certainly seems like it would need to be part of such a master crypto node.

With closed-source development, it's clear what vaporware is. If LN were being developed by a company behind closed doors, LN would indeed be vaporware. 
The situation is less clear with open-source software, as the public can follow the development process in real time. 
"Vaporware" implies that very little, or indeed *nothing*, might actually exist, other than the announcement, because with closed-source development, a partially developed product is indistinguishable from a nonexistent product. 
Still, I think it's unfair to call LN vaporware, as it's clear that progress is rapidly being made.

I guess it depends on what software you use to spend with.  I've never used paper wallets myself, so I actually don't know.

I'm no expert, but IIUC, Schnorr signatures are smaller and faster than ECDSA for all current use cases, and in addition you can use them for "batch signatures", which massively improve memory and processing requirements for larger transactions such as multisig and transactions with lots of inputs and/or outputs. They also enable much better coin mixing because it's not necessary for each input to provide its own, separate signature, so it's possible to make transactions that essentially do the mixing for you by batching a bunch of inputs and outputs to/from a whole bunch of people together, with just one tiny signature for the whole thing. 
MAST (Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees), OTOH, are like an improved version of P2SH (or, a non-turing-complete version of ethereum ;) ) where you don't need to actually send the script in order to release the coins, so much larger and more complex smart contracts are possible. 
So I believe the answer to your question is no. There's probably some overlap, but Schnorr is essentially an optimization, while MAST is completely new functionality.

Bitso sources its historical data from bitcoinaverage.com, which is interesting, because bitcoinaverage.com says that the all-time high was on November 29, 2013 at 15,513.78, while the recent peak only hit 13,729.85.  But yes, Bitso hit 15,939.43 intraday, and that's higher than bitcoinaverage's all-time high.  
As more people in countries around the world start seeing bitcoin hit new all-time highs as denominated in their government's currency, there should be significant buying pressure :D

Bitcoin's value has always been largely speculative.  As a matter of fact, unless some buyers hold their bitcoin without selling it immediately, bitcoin can have no value at all.  Long-term holders are holding because they believe bitcoin *will* be more valuable *in the future*.  This doesn't make it a bubble; it just makes its value largely speculative.  A bubble can only be determined as such in retrospect; that is, after it pops.  Thus, bitcoin can only be said to be a bubble *right now* if you think it will "pop"; that is, the price will crash significantly lower than where it is now.  Personally, I think the price will go *waaaay* higher before crashing.  But time will tell.

I used to share your view on this, but recently I've come to realize that bitcoin is the settlement layer and lightning is the payment layer. We don't need to put every single transaction on the blockchain, where it's replicated tens of thousands of times and stored for all eternity.

This is actually true (once the Lightning Network is functional). 
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:33:57
It means that the block explorer (blockchain.info in this case) is guessing that the transaction's first output (48500 BTC) is most likely change, while the second output (0.1 BTC) is most likely the amount being transacted (that is, sent to someone other than the sender). 
It's highly unlikely that the sender went to go send someone 48500 BTC and just so happened to have an old output sitting around that was *exactly* the correct amount, plus 0.1 BTC.
It's even less likely given that the 0.1 is a round number and the 48500.08799325 is not.

You're right that businesses have a greater burden than individuals.  I think there's a line, though, where the incentive to use bitcoin outweighs the incentive to honestly report everything.  It's perfectly possible to run a cash business and not report absolutely everything, so why not with bitcoin?  Yes, you're running the risk of being caught, but again, that's just a risk.  If the benefits of using bitcoin outweigh this risk, people will do it.  And the more people that do it, the lower the risk, because the IRS can only audit so many businesses.  There will be additional incentives to be smaller and less visible, or to leave the US entirely if there are friendlier regulatory environments.  If even one country decides to be a bitcoin free-for-all, you can bet that country's economy will be booming in short order, while everyone else's economies will suffer.  You can't fight the market forever.  Just look at what's happening with cannabis.  It used to be illegal pretty much everywhere.  Usage has been increasing regardless.  Now it's becoming legal everywhere, because guess what?  People like to get high.  You can throw away hundreds of billions of dollars fighting the market, and lots of people may have their lives ruined, but eventually the market always wins.

I believe this is a result of mining on top of unverified blocks, a strategy known as "SPV mining".

I guess I prefer to believe that bitcoin's value comes primarily from its believers rather than simply a treadmill of "greater fools", because this is what differentiates bitcoin from a Ponzi scheme. I also think that, without the believers, there *wouldn't* be new buyers. That is, without people holding the currency, if everyone just bought and sold instantly, the currency would have no value. Put another way, if fiat got its act together and let people buy and sell bitcoin instantly and without friction in all cases, then no one would hold bitcoin, because it using it would be no different from using fiat. The reason bitcoin has value is because there are good reasons to buy it and *not sell it*. So, while the users may be a component of the value, the believers are primary as there would be no users without them. 
It's also clear to me that no one would invest in bitcoin without the existence of these believers, as they are the ones working tirelessly to improve the ecosystem. If bitcoin had no investors, then there would be no progress, and it makes sense to me that some other cryptocurrency would someday overtake it, in that case. 
It's also clear to me that these believers exist; otherwise there's no way to explain why the price bounced back from $200 after the $1200 peak. Clearly some people are holding no matter what.
Sorry for the rambling mess. My point is that "believers" are absolutely essential to bitcoin's success, while "users" who buy in and sell out are at most secondary, if necessary at all. We'll always have believers as long as we're always progressing towards the vision of a trustless, decentralized, instant global cash. It does not matter how *fast* we are progressing towards this vision, as long as it remains in view. But there are ways to permanently destroy the vision, such as losing network decentralization. Then we have to start over from the beginning.

Do you have any evidence for this? I held through the entire bear market in 2014-15, and I've never done a single darknet trade. I assume there are more like me. Doesn't that mean bitcoin was a "bubble" throughout the bear market? 


No. Gold's value is driven by its usefulness as money, and by its network of users. That is, it's durable, portable, recognizable, fungible, etc. Its use in "industry" does not matter much; otherwise there's no reason for the wild swings in price we've seen over the past few decades.

Beautiful article! Open source does indeed enforce *only* a temporary benevolent dictatorship. Bitcoin was designed not to have any (trusted) leaders, and this fork will finally put to test this amazing feature! 
With at least four months to prepare for the fork, the only problem I can foresee with this fork is that consensus will not have been reached by then. If not, the hard fork should rapidly resolve as miners choose which fork they want to mine more. I can't see any resulting confusion lasting more than a couple of days, since everyone will have had ample time to prepare. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:09


Yes, exactly. 


Not exactly. The nodes ("computers") that don't keep up with new blocks and transactions start to get out of consensus ("agreement") with the rest of the network, so the other nodes (who *are* keeping up) just start to ignore them. Transactions are said to be confirmed ("through") once included in a valid block. The nodes that are fast enough to receive and validate the block containing your transaction before the *next* block comes out are "in consensus". If you happen to be watching one of these "in consensus" nodes and a block comes out confirming your transaction, you'll see that your transaction went "through". If you're not, you won't.
The main thing affecting how fast your transaction gets confirmed (by the nodes that are *in* consensus) is not the *speed of the nodes* on the network, but rather the *block size limit*, which limits the number of transactions that can be confirmed in each block. This limit is in place to prevent a situation where miners produce larger and larger blocks, while the rest of the network struggles to keep up. If this limit were not in place, you would indeed see a situation where the slower nodes on the network would constantly be falling out of consensus with the rest of the network.
Since there's a limit to the number of transactions that can be included in a block, and since miners can choose which transactions to include, they look to include the transactions that pay them the highest fees. So, the higher your fee, the more likely it is that your transaction will be confirmed in the next block.
Your questions are definitely not "stupid"; keep 'em coming! :) 
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:29:26
Game theory and economics. One of the least known genius innovations of bitcoin was its understanding and application of incentives. Any potential attacker's optimal strategy is to simply be honest. The only way to attack the network is by gaining enough hashing power to mine half the new coins, and at that point, you're so invested in hashing power that, given the rewards, you might as well just mine honestly.

No. The whole network has to come to consensus as to which transactions are confirmed every ten minutes (on average), so the slowest computers are either the bottleneck, or they are simply left behind.

It depends on the car. There are [plenty of cars]( that lose very little of their value year over year. Antique cars hold up even better. 
But you're missing my point, which was that OP can surely find something other than fiat currency to put his bitcoin into. 


*I* would :) 
 


I disagree that these are the only options for investing your coins. Especially now that cryptocurrency is a thing, there are plenty of other coins and bitcoin 2.0 projects to invest in. For instance, Ethereum ether is selling for 0.003 btc apiece, which is 6 times higher than the pre-sale price last year, and they're gathering steam, having just launched their platform. There's also bitcoin lending platforms like btcjam and bitlendingclub. Yes, it takes a little more effort to find good investments in the crypto space, but the potential upsides are way better than what you'd get in the fiat space, if you always make good decisions. 
Ultimately, it really depends on what OP is intending to do with his fiat once he gets it. I'm just questioning his decision to throw away so many beautiful, anonymous, violence-free coins in exchange for fiat, which is guaranteed to lose him his privacy and simply lose value over time. Obviously if OP has an urgent need to acquire something that valuable and can't find anyone who takes bitcoin, he's making the right decision. But I disagree that you can't make bitcoin "work for you".

True - in bitcoin, your own anonymity is somewhat dependent on that of people you transact with. That doesn't mean bitcoin isn't *inherently* anonymous; it just means that in practice it often is not because most people don't take care to protect their identities. Of course, it's still *possible* to transact anonymously with bitcoin; this is proven by major hacks such as Gox and Stamp, and by the large quantity of hackers and drug dealers who transact every day without getting caught. 
This isn't to say that bitcoin couldn't be made *easier to use anonymously*.. it just irks me that people say bitcoin "isn't anonymous", as though there exists some theoretical system that will protect your identity despite being publicly traceable to you, due to your own inability to keep your identity private. Obviously such a system cannot exist. Imagine for a moment the most anonymous possible currency. If you announce to the whole world that you did a particular transaction with a particular person, does that mean the currency isn't anonymous? No, it just means that you doxxed yourself, and whoever your partner was. 
Therefore, if bitcoin isn't anonymous, then *nothing is anonymous*, which renders the statement either false or meaningless.

Would you care to provide this definition? Enlighten me. 


Oh really? What/where is this "literature"? Your response amounts to "because I said so, and I have fancy flair", which is not a real response. 
My point is that it's not possible to implement a system that protects a user's identity in *all circumstances*, and therefore it doesn't make sense to define "anonymous" that narrowly, given that no possible system can even *theoretically* meet that standard. So either bitcoin is anonymous because it is *possible to use it anonymously*, or nothing  is anonymous. I'm open to the idea of defining anonymity on a spectrum, where bitcoin is *less* anonymous than some other currency. 
But in my mind it makes no sense to say that bitcoin isn't anonymous, because if bitcoin isn't anonymous, then what is?

The more I think about it, the more I feel that a free market in a world with violence-free money is the best of all possible methods of distributed governance... just crowdfund everything. Think about it: the most pressing problems would have the biggest bounties, and thus would get done the fastest. The reward would go to anyone who could prove that they solved the problem and honestly earned the bounty. The "investors" would each judge whether or not the problem was solved and own a percentage of the resulting solution, *in proportion* to their share of the total investment, but they wouldn't get to have the solution unless they deemed it successful, so investors would be incentivized to actually pay up. I think this is the optimal system of goverment.

Contentious has been a word for a long time. No one "defined" it. It's pretty obvious that the segwit2x fork is contentious.

Agreed! I always thought it was rather poetic that Satoshi could be *anyone*... so maybe he is. It doesn't matter who originated the idea of bitcoin; what matters is that there's now a large, determined mass of fairly intelligent people who all share a common disdain for centralization and a love of technology and its power to liberate the individual. If Satoshi were identified, it would detract from the the importance of this common vision. Plus, he'd probably have a rather difficult life.

Wait, you think there's *no reason* for bitcoin's growth?? Do you own any? Have you ever used it? 


No. In 5+ years, it will still not be in a bubble, because 10 years after that, the price will be *even higher*. By your logic, gold is a 10,000-year-old bubble just waiting to pop, any day now. 


What's your definition of "real reason"? 


Yes, because people rapidly exited the housing market, popping the bubble. 
I completely agree that the 2007 housing market crash indicates that the previous few years had been a bubble, *if you zoom in*, and *especially* if you were one of the people who got burned because you thought it would keep going up forever, but you panic sold once the price started tanking.  On the other hand, if you were calmly buying at the bottom, I'd say it wasn't a bubble for you, because you were looking at the big picture. 
In reality, nobody can say whether an asset is in a bubble until it pops. And even then, depending on the long-term viability of the asset, by some definitions it was not a bubble. That is, if the asset eventually keeps reaching new all-time highs, then it wasn't a bubble. You could say that bitcoin is in a mini-bubble every time the price hits a new ATH and then bottoms out. The only difference between these mini-bubbles and the larger ones that take a year or two is time scale.
I'm not saying that bitcoin isn't in a bubble right now, I'm just saying that *by some definitions of bubble*, it is not.

I think this is exactly what I signed up for. Bitcoin will continue to have existential threats forever, but it's impossible for bitcoin to become permanently captured, because a more decentralized cryptocurrency will always be worth more than a centralized one, and it's always trivial to fork whenever centralization builds.
I definitely don't agree that we're "puppets" of some rich elite; yes, of course the rich will always have more power than the poor, but in a meritocracy, such a system is actually optimal, and crypto's open nature ensures that it will always be run by the market, which means that it will always be a meritocracy. If the 99% decide to start their own coin, more power to them, but it has to compete on the open market vs the 1% coin, and no amount of violence will help.

I didn't say I buy "anonymously"... obviously my purchases through Coinbase are easily traceable. Once I remove my coins from Coinbase, however, they become much harder to trace. 


Coinbase uses ACH, which is similar to, but [not the same thing as]( a wire transfer. 


Agreed; acquiring bitcoin with a high degree of anonymity is very hard, especially if you're wanting to buy with fiat. Even ATMs require all sorts of personal info because of AML/KYC laws.

Yes, and bitcoin XT is [currently supported]( as being the most likely fork to win eventual consensus. 


This is absurd reasoning. The only reason bitcoin XT is considered a fork here is because *it makes changes to the protocol*. Does this mean that any changes to the protocol are off-topic? When new BIPs are added, like 66, and multisig addresses, do you shun discussion of these new features as "off-topic"?? No! Bitcoin needs periodic changes to its protocol in order to stay relevant. 


If a majority of users accepts it, **YOU BET IT IS**.  Bitcoin is whatever people agree to use. 


YES!! This is exactly what I'm saying!! If a set of consensus rules can *possibly, mathematically* become *the* consensus rules, then it makes sense to allow discussion of those rules! You are guilty of what the Commission on Presidential Debates is guilty of when they omit the Libertarian and Green Parties from the Presidential debates... you want to pretend as though any candidate who doesn't share your view doesn't exist, and you are abusing your position as gatekeeper of the information (the media) to do so. 




I always respected you before this, because it seemed like you always gave an equal voice to all sides in a debate. Bitcoin thrives on the free flow of information and indeed, this is the primary weapon we have against the legacy financial system. Once bitcoin becomes co-opted by someone's agenda, it ceases to be free and open, and thus ceases to be stronger than the system it is trying to replace. Please do not inject your own agenda into this search for truth. Let the chips fall where they may. Bitcoin must choose the *right* way, and the only way it can do that is with full knowledge of *all* options. 


If your beliefs are "the Truth", why are you so afraid of opposing viewpoints? Do you not trust this community to evaluate things logically and come to a rational consensus about how to proceed? Why do you feel that you must limit people's access to information in order for them to arrive at your preferred conclusion? Do you really think that your conclusion is correct given these insecurities? 
Please, do the right thing and don't censor the half of the debate you don't agree with. Truth is strength, and you can make this community twice as strong by allowing access to the whole truth.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:40
Wow, you're really having a hard time with this.
The question was:


My answer was:


My point is that the definition of "bubble" depends entirely on your point of view.  By *most* definitions, yeah, it looks like a bubble.  But if you zoom *in*, all the little monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and minute-ly gyrations also look like bubbles.  Why do you think that the 2013 run-up in price was a "bubble", but bitcoin popping from $7900 to $5400 just a couple weeks ago wasn't?  I'll tell you why; it's because you don't care about time scales that short, and the price was back up over $7900 within a couple of weeks.  If the price had kept declining over the next few months or years, everyone would have called it a bubble.  Why?  Because a few months or years is a long time for an asset to be declining, in most people's view.
But if you're like me and you believe bitcoin will continue to grow over the next decade or two, you don't care as much about short-term gyrations such as the big one in 2013.  From that point of view, a 4-year moving average is perfectly reasonable.
Yes, I understand that this is an unconventional way to look at things, but I saw the original question


as a challenge to come up with a way in which bitcoin isn't currently experiencing a bubble.
Does that make sense?

Wences explains bitcoin really well! I loved his explanation of mining... It's a lottery, where each unit of processing power is a ticket. You have 1 unit of processing power, you get 1 ticket; you have 2 units of processing power, you get 2 tickets, etc.  This helps explain, without oversimplifying, why more more total network hash power means that it's harder to get the block reward, and also why the inflation rate is so perfectly predictable.

Because in the end, it's the miners who *actually decide* which fork to mine. You can change the consensus rules all you want and convince nearly everyone that your changes are a good idea, but they will never get adopted unless you convince a majority of the *hash power* to run your code.
On the flipside of this, if a fork is imminent, you better know what code the majority of the hash power is *planning* to use; otherwise you risk losing tons of money.  
Consensus works both ways; you want to make the best decisions for the future of bitcoin, but you also have to listen to what the hash power wants, otherwise they can just ignore you.

Well sure, I'm not talking legally, I'm just saying that bitcoins are not literally carried, because I'm being a smartass :p
The private key or seed, on the other hand, could be on your phone, on a piece of paper, in the cloud somewhere, or simply in your head. The first two of these are clearly physically on your person (since you need them with you in order to access your coins). The situation with the latter two, however, is much less certain. Is "knowledge of how to access money" the same thing as "carrying" money? 
Practically, you should always just say no anyway, especially if you're using a brainwallet, or some other sufficiently obfuscated medium, like a digital file that, when hashed, produces a private key. How are they ever going to find out you're lying?

"Paper gold" is not gold. This brings up another reason bitcoin is better than gold: in order to enable actual commerce with gold, people are forced to use paper representing it, which invariably leads to more paper than gold. With bitcoin, every transaction done on-chain is a transfer of real coins. Fractional reserve is only possible off-chain. 
I'm not saying that bitcoin enforces an equitable distribution, or that it's desirable for everyone to have the same amount of wealth; I'm just saying that with gold as currency, an equitable distribution is *impossible*, thus encouraging a wide wealth gap, whereas with bitcoin it's at least possible to have a fair distribution with a good store of value and medium of exchange.

A bitcoin address is considered valid as long as the last 4 characters are a valid checksum of the preceding characters:

You're not an idiot if you don't get bitcoin, just as you're not an idiot if you don't understand the global banking system. They're both very complicated. Government issued money makes buying and selling things very easy, but in order to use it on the Internet, you have to give it to a bank where they hold onto it for you. This causes a number of problems:
- It's very expensive and slow to send money across borders. With bitcoin it's instant and practically free. 
- Banks can prevent you from sending payments or close your account for any reason or no reason at all. Bitcoin does not do this. 
- Banks give your personal information to government agencies who then spy on what you're buying and selling. Bitcoin does not require any personal information at all to use. 
- Whenever you make a payment, you give all of your payment details to the merchant, who then pulls the money out of your account. This is very insecure, making it extremely easy for hackers (or the merchant itself) to steal money out of your account. With bitcoin, you never give away the information needed to spend your money, so it's much more secure. 
- Because everyone is required to store their government issued money in banks, this gives banks a huge amount of power, which they usually abuse: 
- Central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England can create more money whenever they want, making themselves richer while making everyone else poorer. This is called inflation, and it's the reason why your money is losing value every year, even if you keep it in a savings account. Bitcoin has a fairly high inflation rate right now, but it's tightly controlled by computers, and in the next year or two, it will fall to a more "normal" level. In fact, bitcoins will be issued slower and slower until the year 2140. No more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be issued. This means that in the long run, your bitcoins will be worth more and more, rather than less. 
- A practice known as "fractional reserve banking" allows banks to lend out more money than they have. Occasionally, when the government goes too deep into debt and times get tough, people try to get their money out of a bank all at once, but the bank only has a small fraction of all the deposits, so it's unable to allow withdrawals. This causes the bank to collapse, and almost everyone who had money in that bank loses it. This is called a "bank run", and it's the reason all the banks in Greece are closed right now. Central banks like the Fed and the ECB are supposed to solve this problem, but they don't. Instead, the biggest banks become bigger and bigger at the expense of the smaller banks, which concentrates everyone's money into fewer and fewer banks. When one of these "too big to fail" banks has a bank run, the entire economy crashes, leading to greater and greater wealth inequality. See the 2008 financial crisis. 
TL;DR: bitcoin is Internet money that is much cheaper, faster, and more convenient than government-issued money in practically every situation. On top of this, it allows you to "be your own bank", which is great for everyone because banks make the wealth gap wider and wider. Do you absolutely need to start using bitcoin right now? Probably not, but it's good to be prepared for the future.

I've never bought bitcoin with a wire transfer or a credit card; I always go through Coinbase or Bitwage. 
But the fact that these methods of acquiring bitcoin are anonymous does not mean *bitcoin* isn't anonymous; it just means that *fiat money* isn't anonymous, which we already knew. Bitcoin doesn't *inherently* attach personal information to your address, and therefore bitcoin is *inherently* anonymous. It's only when interfacing with other, non-anonymous networks that personal information becomes associated with your address.

Yes, bitcoin could operate more like bittorrent, wherein each node hosts only what it can. The problem then becomes incentivizing nodes to store all the data, because you wouldn't want to risk some transactions disappearing forever. I suppose the best strategy might be having all parties of every transaction store the transaction, as they are the stakeholders in that data. Everyone else only needs *hashes* of this data, to verify that the original data has not been altered.

Actually, if you look at [annual VC funding]( as bitcoin's "funding rounds", funding has been increasing all the time. 
But my point is that bitcoin's price is its valuation by the *public market*, a piece of data that most startups don't have access to because most startups aren't publicly traded. If all startups were publicly traded like bitcoin, I bet you'd see long periods of apparent stagnation as the rule, rather than the exception. A stock's perceived value is heavily dependent on swings in public opinion, and an unestablished product like bitcoin is especially susceptible to these swings. That's why companies don't normally go public until they're somewhat established.

This is true; fiat currency would be useless without laws requiring their use. This is not applicable to assets such as bitcoin and gold, however, whose values are based on factors other than government fiat. 


No, it's the same issue; that's what I'm trying to say. If the government decides to debase the currency, *the value of your dollars decreases*. This directly contradicts the claim that the value of dollars is guaranteed! 


I don't think "a security" is in any way guaranteed not to lose value; it is simply "a tradeable financial asset":  
Again, dollars are not guaranteed not to lose value any more than bitcoin is, and therefore, they are not backed by anything more secure than bitcoin is. In fact, I would argue that, since no one person or organization can hyperinflate bitcoin, that bitcoin is *more* secure than the dollar. 
The only thing securing the dollar's value right now is its network effect. When bitcoin's user network rivals that of the dollar (if that ever happens), people won't be claiming that it's laws that give a currency its value, which is ridiculous on its face. Dollars had value as gold certificates long before they were accepted in payment for taxes; otherwise they would not have been acceptable in payment of taxes. 
The fact that dollars still have value despite not being backed by anything is simply a relic from the days when it *was* backed by gold. The only thing keeping the dollar alive today is the gigantic global network of users and the lack of any *other* asset which is spendable in so many places. That is, a currency is a network of individuals who have agreed to pay each other's debts. Since the dollar is the largest such network, it makes sense to join and participate in the network, because this maximizes your options for reimbursement when you provide value to someone else in the network. This "chicken and egg" effect is what keeps the dollar strong. It's just like any other network, like Facebook or owning a telephone. And like Facebook, bitcoin can steal the dollar's (MySpace's) network once people realize that it's fundamentally superior. 
My point with all this is that, if bitcoin's network and technology mature to the point where millions of people all over the world are accepting it, the fact that dollars are accepted in payment of taxes in America will be proven irrelevant.

Which use cases are those? 


I bet if you made a good argument in favor of permissioned ledgers, some people would probably agree with you. 


The circle jerking level on this sub is no higher than it's always been, which is significant. However, people are always receptive to a well-argued point. I think the argument against permissioned ledgers is generally that centralizing a blockchain defeats the whole point of having a blockchain, which is an immutable public ledger. Once you give a single party the ability to change the ledger, it becomes a really slow, resource-heavy database, which is less useful than just a normal database. 
What are the arguments for? 
Edit: I see that you've already made some arguments in your previous post. There are already very fast, efficient, distributed database systems. Taking away the ability to do a "DELETE" does not in any way improve on these designs, as it simply creates more work and uses more resources when a mistake is made. It also doesn't affect the "witness"'s ability to wreak havoc on the ledger by creating more money for himself, blocking valid transactions, etc.

Actually, that last paragraph there was intended as an argument for my claims. 


So basically you're saying, "hey, I know all you guys think these blockchain-without-bitcoin people are wrong, but maybe they're not, because of reasons I don't understand". Great, once you understand the reasons, get back to me and we'll have a real debate. 


Yep. 


How does a centralized blockchain do this better than a distributed database with backups or versioning? Why is it desirable to implement experimental new technology merely to comply with the law? Can you think of any other instances in which banks voluntarily did this? 
Does a centralized blockchain *really* get rid of the delete feature? Seems to me that the "witness" could not only obstruct "settlement finality" indefinitely; they could also alter any past transactions and start "mining" on the altered chain. Any nodes not in agreement with the witness would be in an invalid state. Can you think of any *possible* advantages a centralized blockchain has over an ordinary database given these concerns? 


Great, a link! Can you point me to where in this document from 1998 it says that banks need to implement experimental new technology? Or maybe just the part that's relevant to our discussion? 


Sometimes when you don't understand an issue, the reasons why you're wrong aren't readily apparent. So the fact that r/Bitcoin appears to be "not engaging adequately" or circlejerking isn't necessarily an indication that everyone else is wrong. It may simply be an indication that *you* need to educate yourself. 
The real reason why the "blockchain good, bitcoin bad" arguments are definitely hogwash is that [they were made up by marketers for banks researching bitcoin, in order not to scare people away](

Bitcoin is also different from a normal company in that its value flows entirely from its decentralization.  Once you compromise decentralization even the tiniest amount, the value proposition evaporates.  So adoption really should not be the focus at all right now.

I think you're right with crypto &lt;&gt; fiat trades.  I suppose this is how Bitsquare operates.  With crypto &lt;&gt; crypto, I can imagine a system wherein an order becomes a transaction on a blockchain, which is satisfied once another transaction either takes the order or cancels it, whichever comes first.  Does that sound plausible?
@_date: 2016-09-18 03:33:55
The transaction will be visible on the blockchain.  If you transfer all the coins out at once, it will be obvious the new wallet belongs to you as well.
@_date: 2016-09-29 18:35:02
This is true. Once the government starts torturing people to steal their bitcoins, this will simply drive people towards bitcoin more.  If the government manages to succeed at trapping the supply of bitcoin, people will simply move to a different cryptocurrency.  Once it's clear that cryptocurrency is a safe haven, nation states will no longer be able to fund tax collection.

There should be a log file called debug.log in your bitcoin data directory, which may reveal an error. Also, you should have 8 connections, even if your ports aren't forwarded properly. 3 indicates that your node is having problems finding peers. Is your machine/connection super low-powered?

your* definition
@_date: 2016-09-24 01:55:55
There are so many things potentially wrong with this article.  
First of all, what defines a recession?  I would count the period from 2008-now as a sort of sustained economic downturn.  Without a central bank setting interest rates, downturns are short and sharp, but the areas between them are more prosperous and actually contain strong growth.
Second, the period from 1871-1900 was marked by a huge increase in the centralization of everything due to large banks colluding to repeatedly crash the economy so as to take complete control, which eventually happened with the establishment of the Fed.  I would want to examine the period between 1837 and the Civil War to see if its number are better than the later period.
Third, The United States became the leading superpower and the dollar became the world's reserve currency shortly following the establishment of the Fed; the following prosperity can probably be attributed to gains the United States made at the expense of other nations.
There are lots of other potential problems, but hopefully these will get it started.

Right, that's what I'm saying.  If something is a bad investment, that doesn't make it *not* an investment, it just makes it a shitty investment.  Everything is an investment, even things that are consumed today, because those things have long-lasting effects on your mental, physical, and emotional well-being.  Yes, I understand that I'm playing with the definition of the word "investment" here, but I think a more expansive definition of the word would lead people to make better decisions.
@_date: 2016-09-26 17:56:47
This is the result of something called "SPV mining". Basically, it's where miners mine on top of each other's blocks without verifying the integrity of the new blocks in order to get a head start on the next block. 
If you want to mine a block with transactions in it, you have to make sure that none of the transactions in the new block were already included in the old block. It takes valuable processing time to go through the mempool and eliminate transactions from the new block. While this verification process is happening, miners are free to hash on an empty block (and actually, unless they're hashing *something*, they're losing money), because there are no possible collisions with transactions in the block currently being validated.

You forget that bitcoin is volatile as fuck. This means that periodically (i.e. when the market peaks), it is a huge and obvious opportunity to sell your coins for diversification into other assets, to protect yourself from the imminent crash.

Bitcoin's value is a collective hallucination, so it makes sense to convince people not to panic sell. Panic selling leads to more panic selling, which leads to long bear markets. The same applies to irrational exuberance. We can't have noobs investing more than they can afford to lose, because then they panic sell at the first sign of trouble, leading to the aforementioned bear markets.

@_date: 2018-02-05 17:33:45
This is outdated thinking. Cryptocurrency technology allows the average person to hold a basket of many different seamlessly exchangeable currencies, rather than being forced to hold just one national currency as has been the case historically. Because of this, volatility doesn't matter as much, and the chosen store of value will be the asset that has historically had the best performance. Right now, bitcoin is beating the pants off of national currencies in terms of performance. Who'd want to hold an asset that goes down in value 2% per year when they could hold one that goes up 10x every two years? Obviously this won't be the case forever, as eventually a majority of the world's savings could be stored in bitcoin, and obviously at that point the potential upside is limited, but *only* at that point will some other asset become a more popular store of value.

This is a persistent effect because the crypto market is free and as such, the most popular crypto will always have the most holders and thus will always be improving the fastest. 


Right, because **bitcoin's security is the anchor of the entire crypto market**. This is not a random occurrence; bitcoin is the most secure because it is the most battle-tested. If there are questions about bitcoin's security, then there must necessarily be questions about the security of *literally every single other blockchain, too*.

@_date: 2017-09-10 03:01:16
It seems to me that this still doesn't apply to bitcoin vs fiat, as bitcoin doesn't have a "face value"; it only has the value (in units of fiat) that the market gives it, which is constantly being reevaluated, in real time. Also, fiat is subject to extreme hyperinflation, so even if it makes sense to spend it faster, there comes a point where inflation is so high that *not accepting it at all* becomes necessary, and forcing the population to accept it at the point of a gun becomes necessary in order to keep it in use at all. This is in contrast with commodity currencies, where the metal always has at least some "melt-down" value. 
Gresham's Law makes sense in a situation where there are two competing coins with the same face value, but different metal content. In this case it makes sense to hoard the coins with a more valuable metal content because... they're more valuable. With bitcoin, on the other hand, it always makes economic sense to buy something at a fair price, as quoted in fiat or some other standard unit of account, because "$10 worth of bitcoin" is always worth exactly "$10 worth of bitcoin", no matter how much bitcoin's market value jerks around.
So the reason "bad money drives out good money" is that, when deciding which coin to use for a given transaction, you want to hold onto the coin that you expect to hold its value, while spending the one you expect to depreciate. The good coin has a higher risk-weighted value than the bad one, but they both buy the same amount of goods now. But if people stop accepting the bad coin entirely because it's hyperinflated (and there's no guns forcing them to accept it) then the bad money gets driven out by the good.

The argument goes something like this:
We can't scale to VISA levels on chain, so we need off-chain solutions ASAP.  High fees incentivize the development of off-chain scaling solutions, so small blocks are a good thing, at least until the lightning network gets deployed.  There was virtually no progress on off-chain scaling until the blocks got filled up, then BOOM! Lots of activity.  Full blocks got the job done.

You don't think things go on sale relative to bitcoin every now and then? 


I don't detect a problem in your scenario. 


"Permanent recession" is an oxymoron because by definition a recession is "slower growth than usual". If "usual" is already slow, then we're not in a recession if current growth is in line with projections. 
And anyway, I disagree that it would happen as you prescribe. If everyone is holding a basket of cryptocurrencies, I guarantee that, at any given moment, one of those currencies will be declining in value. That's the one people will spend. Just because bitcoin tends to go up over time doesn't mean that this process is smooth, or that everyone is holding only bitcoin. 


What does any of this have to do with bitcoin having a strictly limited supply? The poor are disproportionately sensitive to *everything*, so your argument could apply to just about anything. 


I actually doubt that; I think it will be extremely disruptive in the short term. But longer-term I'm optimistic. 


Did you mean to say "future" instead of "current" here? 


Wait, what does this even mean?

It really depends on the cost-benefit tradeoffs. Bitmain *is* far and away the most productive ASIC manufacturer. If someone wanted to make a bunch of special ASICs with tons of fast memory, there's no one better to pull this off than Bitmain. It's not inconceivable that they were using covert asicboost on mainnet. It's even more probable that they're using it on Bcash since that blockchain didn't have a segwit upgrade.

Right, and security is crypto's selling point. Without a significant security improvement, crypto is no better than the legacy financial system, which is secured by a centralized arbiter (i.e. not secure). A blockchain easily collapses back to the legacy security model if security guarantees are insufficient. And there's no way to tell whether a blockchain is sufficiently secure unless it survives an attack by a state actor. And you'd expect attacks to be focused on the most popular blockchain. So, this is another way bitcoin's first mover advantage is sticky. 


Are you including bitcoin in this? Because I'd say global online trade is a huge, proven use case for crypto. 


True, though I expect this to change once the lightning network goes live. 


Agreed. 


I agree that both iota and ethereum are interesting. But it's quite another thing to imagine that either could have a market cap larger than bitcoin's with developers making rookie mistakes like [this]( Imagine if IOTA had been larger than bitcoin when this was announced. The effect would have been catastrophic. Ethereum is much more mature tech than iota, of course, but their development philosophy is essentially "move fast and break things" which, again, is not somewhere I'd be comfortable parking the majority of my holdings. It's fun to stick some extra capital into such ventures in the hopes of striking it rich, but there's no good reason to *leave* a large amount of money invested, unless some unresolvable security hole is discovered in *bitcoin*, which *is* resolvable on some other chain. But even if that happens, the entire crypto market would take years to recover from such a shock. 


I hope that's really how it works 


Cool, yeah, I have no problem with alts trying to unseat bitcoin. Alt communities just need to realize that the number 1 crypto takes essentially all the "heat", and that if a "flippening" were to occur, the new number 1 crypto would need to be able to sustain a massive increase in attacks. Virtually all cryptos have a larger attack surface than bitcoin's, which is why I doubt that any crypto will unseat bitcoin any time soon. Decentralized exchanges will make it trivial to hold bitcoin while only switching to a different token as needed.

The above is what I love about bitcoin. Since there's no way to extract wealth from the system using force, all industry players are incentivized to either provide real value to their users, or to help bitcoin itself grow and expand.
Unlike the legacy financial system, there are no incentives to be a parasite, extracting wealth through force or fraud. This is ultimately why bitcoin will supplant the legacy system.

I don't understand how these things are different from bitcoin? Stock only appreciates insofar as people are willing to buy it. Same with real estate, same with bitcoin. These are all just places to park your capital, each having different risk profiles. 


Well sure, but you could also say that these things are just *bad* places to park your capital; i.e. bad investments. Same goes for a crappy TV that breaks after a few months, or a car that needs a lot of maintenance. Ultimately the individual is the judge as to whether what they bought was worth what they traded for it; i.e. whether it was a good investment. 


Sure. 


This is where you lose me. The expected profit to a bitcoin holder is - wildly - positive if you look at past performance, as long as they waited a few years to trade some of their holdings for something else. 
And looking into the future, as long as there is more money to be stored in bitcoin, the value should keep going up, until bitcoin is the reserve currency, at which point the appreciation should level off. But even then, I see no reason to expect bitcoin holders to suffer major losses. Obviously at that point, far in the future, there needs to be economic activity so that it can be stored - but as long as the total wealth of the world is always increasing, bitcoin's technology isn't supplanted by something better, and no one manages to exploit a fatal flaw in the bitcoin system, I expect bitcoin to continue being a good investment. 
It doesn't matter that miners are taking a bunch of the money because the value of each coin is still appreciating; that is, more money is flowing into bitcoin than the miners are removing. (The miners can be compared, in this case, to the employees of a company - yes, they're being paid a salary, but the total payroll is less than the total revenue, so equilibrium is achieved.)
*Even if* bitcoin's expected return were not that good, it would still perform better than fiat currency (and the rest of those things that you call "not investments"), which as we know depreciates a few percent annually. Thus, it's rational to trade one's fiat for bitcoin  because one is expected to appreciate more than the other. Or, in your language, it's rational to "invest" capital that "isn't invested". Don't you agree? 
And *even if* bitcoin were not expected to appreciate more than fiat currency, it's still not a worse investment than many stocks that perform badly. The difference, of course, is that bitcoin's historical performance has been unprecedented in the speed of its appreciation, so again, it seems irrational to expect this to suddenly reverse.
Does all of this make sense? Sorry for the long comment.

Nothing whatsoever.  If a whole bunch of rich people buy into bitcoin, however, it'll create a whole bunch of *new* rich people who were early adopters.
That being said, it's much easier to stay rich in the fiat economy than in the bitcoin economy, since in the fiat economy you can use your massive pile of cash to steal cash from those with less, whereas with bitcoin, the only way to acquire more is through honest means (or hacking/scamming).  You can't simply call up your friendly politician and have him help you loot others.

Fiat is not anonymous, therefore buying fiat is not anonymous.

You're correct. If a bank made a new cryptocurrency, premined the shit out of it and backed it with fiat, it'd be adopted waaay faster than bitcoin. I could see this happening. The mining incentive would have to be restructured a bit because miners are more wary of premined currencies, but I could see a bank pulling it off. 
The problem is that banks are not very tech savvy and most people who can build a cryptocurrency are probably opposed to banks in general.

@_date: 2015-04-17 20:58:52
Agreed. That would be free banking, which is a much better system than central banking because it doesn't violate the rule that a currency is a ledger of debts, as long as notes from different banks are taken to be different currencies (and the currencies are floated on a market to gauge their relative strengths).  There's still the problem that the bank gets way more credit than it should, because it technically owes everyone way more money than it could ever have.  That being said, it is providing the valuable service of keeping everyone's money safe, which is something.
Problems arise when currencies from different banks are taken to be the same currency, which gives the bank with the lowest reserve ratio the most power.  These problems are compounded by central banks, when you give an institution the power to create money with no reserve ratio and use it to buy the government's debt at a 0% interest rate.

Before banks, people didn't "need loans"; they just saved up and bought stuff once they could afford it.  The only reason you need a loan is because fractional reserve banking removes 90% of your money's value and gives it to the banks, who then loan it back to you at interest.

Hm, yeah, you're right. My brain gets twisted around whenever I think deeply about the process of money creation; it's so opaque.

I wonder if a better middle-of-the-road solution would be if the bank listed how much total funds you have, and how much you can demand instantly, and required you to wait a while before withdrawing the rest, and gave you all of this information upfront and in real time. Obviously a tech burden, but it might mitigate bank runs, and it might make the system seem more honest.

Sure, it will be hard to maintain a huge wealth gap with this level of transparency. This is a vision quite far in the future. In order to achieve this level of transparency, the definition of property rights will have to evolve. I personally think current definitions of private property allow people to own too much stuff. 


True, but my point is that if everyone is transparent, there is actually no need for privacy. Why would anyone do this? 


I think transparency will naturally occur once people start recording everything that happens to them and storing this data somewhere private where only they (and perhaps some other trusted party) can access it. The benefits to this are clear... Every crime could potentially be already solved. This would dissuade crime from happening in the first place. That is, the enforcement would be much more effective if done in a decentralized, rather than centralized, way.


What would be the matter with this? The only reason these things are embarrassing is because *everyone hides them*. If everyone knew about everyone's porn purchases, etc, it wouldn't be embarrassing to buy porn. 


I don't think so. As you said above, the public would demand transparency from big business. This would allow everyone to know if the insurance company is treating people unfairly, so unfair practices would backfire.

I know of no currency that is "universally accepted in trade".  The dollar is accepted for most things in America, but not in most places on earth, and the dollar is the most widely accepted currency.  Your statement becomes weaker as we consider less widely used currencies.


As long as [the number of users is always increasing]( its value will keep increasing and people will keep using it.  As long as there are people wanting to freely exchange money, people will use it.  There is no reason for bitcoin to ever "die", as this demand always exists.

Oh, I see. I like your OS analogy now that you've explained a bit :) 
I think it's a bit different as bitcoin is open, both its source and its ownership, whereas Microsoft was a traditional company. As such, bitcoin can potentially overcome any limitations, including the 1 MB block size limit. 
Bitcoin is a protocol. Any competing protocols can potentially be integrated into it, and probably will since it's the dominant cryptocurrency at the moment. I think sidechains, whenever they happen, will make this even more likely.

Right, base58 makes it pretty much impossible to get confused about which character you're supposed to be typing. And because of the checksum, your chance of sending to an unintended, valid address is ~1 in 4 billion.

Nope, banks are allowed to poof as much money into existence as the need in order to satisfy demand for loans, as long as their reserves are a certain percentage of their outstanding loans.

Great analogy!  You have made my point for me.
By your definition of secure, *there is no lock that can even theoretically be secure, since there is always the chance that it is installed in such a way as to make it useless*.  Therefore, this definition of lock security makes no sense.
The same is true of your definition of anonymity.  If bitcoin is not anonymous because it's possible for people to attach their real-world identities to their bitcoin addresses by being stupid, *then there is no currency that can even theoretically be anonymous*.  Therefore, this definition makes no sense.
Either bitcoin is anonymous, or *nothing is even theoretically capable of being anonymous.*

Thanks!  Very little thought is given to what money *actually is supposed to do*, even on this subreddit.  Even once cryptocurrency becomes the world's reserve currency, there is work to do to form it into this ideal.
I've often tried to imagine what the ideal political system would look like, and I think the reason why no ideal political system has emerged is because there was previously no way for the individual incentives to align with the collective good.  Money is the incentive in any society, and money has always been based on violence, so it seemed insurmountable that those in power would always be the most cunning and violent, which is clearly not in the collective good.
Bitcoin finally creates the chance for us to realign the incentives so that that which is most profitable also happens to create the most positive value for society.  Bitcoin is potentially totally anonymous, and as such it is impossible to steal through violent means, because you can never find the person's private keys.  The Internet will have to become much more anonymous, and digital security best practices will have to be widely improved and adopted, before bitcoin can reach this ideal.  But fiat will never achieve this, while with bitcoin it's possible.

If the average transaction is 500 bytes and we want to scale to match VISA (4000 tps), that's around 1.2 GB / block. This will quickly saturate bandwidth and hard drive space. In addition, even if everyone has gigabit connections, 1.2 GB takes over 8 seconds to transfer. So unless bitcoin developers come up with a more efficient way of doing this, you can expect transaction fees to increase a lot, which will drive users to other blockchains for lower-value transactions.

Yes, I understand that, if nothing else, I donated some money to ethereum's development effort. I will consider it a scam if development slows to a halt. That being said, it's an open source project, so if it doesn't launch, that's partly on me since I am a developer. 
I am prepared to completely lose my investment, and if I do, you can be certain I will never give another bit to Vitalik. If anyone contributed to Ethereum thinking there's some kind of guaranteed return, there were warnings during the ether sale indicating that this was not the case, and that person, not ethereum, should be held responsible. 


As I said, it's open source... Their progress towards the first phase is publicly viewable, and I can potentially help with development. If my 2,000 ether aren't worth the bitcoin I paid for them, that won't particularly surprise me. I really just wanted to help fund development, which is making steady progress. 


This doesn't make sense to me. These guys are developing full time. They can't just go into debt for millions of dollars if they take longer than expected to produce a working product. The Ethereum idea must be tried, even if it doesn't work, because if it fails, that will indicate what needs to be fixed.

Yes, as soon as there was fractional reserve banking and money started disappearing from the economy, people started needing loans.
Yes, banks *used* to provide a valuable service, and that is connecting investors with investments.  But now that we have the Internet, this service can be decentralized with crowdfunding.  Without fractional reserve, the bank is simply a middleman to this process.  With fractional reserve, they are giant tumor weighing down the economy.  Once we get rid of the banks and abolish fractional reserve, crowdfunding will be sufficient for any project.

Yeah, exactly. The only reason banks are allowed to create money out of nothing is because they're allowed to lend out more money than they have, i.e. because fractional reserve banking is legal. If fractional reserve banking were illegal, banks would simply lend their customers' deposits to other customers; no need to poof new money into existence. 
Edit: If fractional reserve banking were illegal, banks would simply hold their customers' deposits without lending.

This is a common misconception.  Bitcoin is perfectly anonymous. An address is literally a large random number run through some hashing functions.  A transaction can be signed offline and broadcast through any node connected to the blockchain.
It is *the Internet* that is not anonymous.  If transactions could be broadcast through media other than the Internet (which they can; you can broadcast a transaction over radio and sound waves), this would guarantee anonymity 100%.
You are correct that some currencies are offering an easier way to cover your tracks, but as long as the Internet has a centralized infrastructure which allows government agencies to spy on network traffic, these currencies will have the same fundamental privacy issues as bitcoin.  "True anonymity" is therefore meaningless here.

Thanks for the explanation! I guess owning a piece of art "officially" is still worth a premium over owning a copy of the original, despite the copy being identical to the original. 


How would this be implemented? I'm sort of fuzzy on what exactly this means. 


Again, this seems rather weak. When would I need to prove that I "officially own" an original piece of art? Other than to sell it for a higher price than all the other copies of the work? How would I get caught violating usage rights if I'm not the official owner?

Gahh, people are so fucking stupid! One of the blockchain's main innovations was aligning the incentives properly so that the miners *will actually mine*. Without a token currency, *no one would mine it* and there would be *no blockchain*.

Ah, now we're getting somewhere. So you're saying that if I give you a paper that says "100 dibs" on it, and say that I'm backing up the paper's value with my full faith and credit, that this gives it no value. However, if I point a gun at you and tell you that you *must* pay me a percentage of your yearly earnings in dibs, or else, then that gives it value. Bonus points if I have the most powerful military in the world. 
Obviously, this is false. Let's say you make $100,000 in a year and need to pay me the equivalent of $10,000 in my currency. But if no one is accepting my currency as payment for stuff, how do you know how many "dibs" you owe? If there is no market for my currency, how do you know how much it's worth? 
It certainly *helps* the dollar's value that the US has a gigantic military and everyone in the US is required to pay their taxes in dollars. But this isn't what gives the dollar its *initial* value. 


Unfortunately, that's not how price discovery works. The dollar is traded on open forex markets with other currencies, and this is what determines its value. The price is not determined by the government; it's determined by supply and demand. If tomorrow, everyone in the whole world except the US government decided to stop accepting dollars as payment, its value would go to zero, and the government would collapse because it would not be able to hire anyone. 
That's one of the beautiful things about bitcoin, by the way. Once there are more Americans accepting bitcoin than dollars, the government will be forced to accept taxes in bitcoin, which will kill the dollar and end the government's ability to spend infinitely. 
TL;DR: the dollar *absolutely* has value because we say it does. The market is the *only* thing that decides the value of things. Though it has been tried time and again, no one can "decree" that something has value.

The biggest use case for people like you, *right now*, is as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin's potential value is on the order of national currencies and gold; more if it becomes the world's reserve currency. This is on the order of $100T, whereas the current value is ~$3B. That means bitcoin's price could go up 30,000x over the next generation or so. 
This may seems farfetched, but there really isn't anything to stop bitcoin from doing this, as there's no way to shut it down, and it's a superior form of money in every way to fiat, as it was natively designed for the Internet. 
The only risks to watch out for are:
1) a hard fork / 51% attack
2) another cryptocurrency that fixes a fatal flaw with bitcoin. 
I invest in bitcoin because I think it'll be worth a lot someday, but I also invest because I like the idea of a future dominated by bitcoin more than one dominated by fiat. At the end of the day, fiat is *violence-based* money; that is, in a fiat world, whoever has the biggest military and is the best at killing people has the most power and wealth. 
This is not how it should be. In a world where *math-based* money is the reserve currency, whoever has *actually provided the most value to society* has the most power and wealth. I think this will fix most of the problems in our world, and bitcoin enables such a world for the first time. 
**TL;DR: Bitcoin's most compelling use case for people like you is as an investment with huge upside potential, not only for your own personal gain, but also as an investment in a better, more peaceful future.**

A poorly-thought-out response.  
These people can totally pull their own weight.  We have the Internet.  It is theoretically possible for everyone to produce something of value periodically that is at least as valuable as the food they ate and the shelter they lived in over that same period.  This includes art, music, poetry, thoughts, feelings, etc.  Everything creative someone does has value to someone else.
And even if someone is so disabled that they can't produce anything currently, they probably produced something in the past that more than covers today.
And even if they can't do that, they're probably friends with someone who is willing to produce that value for them.  
If they don't have any of these things, then yes, there's no reason for them to live.  But food and shelter are *very cheap* in our world, and in a world where everyone is pulling their own weight, these things are *even cheaper*.  Currently there are a lot of unemployed/underemployed people who *could* be pulling their own weight, but the current system is not optimized to allow this.

I do lots of things people don't consider wise. I fully accept the consequences of my actions. It's worth it to me because I think fractional reserve banking is the most insidious form of fraud ever devised, and the root cause of most of the major problems in our world. I would like to see cryptocurrency replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. This will never occur as long as everyone is still accepting dollars as payment for labor, goods, and services. A currency's value is derived almost entirely from the size of its network. In order for the dollar to be vulnerable, its network needs to start shrinking. 
Thus, there needs to be a movement towards accepting only cryptocurrency. Someone has to be first. Might as well be me.

You could theoretically have a blockchain with no currency, so it's basically a database of transactions where each block contains a hash of the previous block. You could theoretically have only one party mining, or only one party funding the mining, but this is at best a really slow, expensive event log. There is no possible way this would have any advantage over existing data transmission systems.

Property taxes, proportional to the number of acres you own, are the only tax that makes sense. The government's only legitimate job is as a security agency. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 22:12:29


But if you leak your address somewhere, or transfer it over an insecure connection, or otherwise allow personally identifiable information to be disclosed, then any transaction can still be traced to you.  Thus, monero and dash don't fix the "installed it next to a window" problem.  Again, no possible currency can fix this problem.


That's not true at all.  I think monero and dash are making great improvements to transaction privacy.  I'm just saying that they are not "truly anonymous" in any way that bitcoin isn't.

No. The alternative is *the free market* incentivizing behavior. The government is simply a middleman to the communication of incentives with their desired outcomes. 
The only reason the government is potentially a force for good in our current world is because fiat money creates bad people with tons of money, who then distort the free market, making it less free. 
Once we fix money with bitcoin, the incentives will be realigned so that the rich people are *actually the most valuable people to society as a whole*, since ideally, money is a record of how much value each person has contributed to society. Bitcoin achieves this by making it more profitable to be honest than to be dishonest. 
Thus, once we have a free market with honest money, the government will be unnecessary.

Why "sparsely populated"? Yes, it would need to be small if it were bitcoin, right now, but it doesn't need to be right now - bitcoin is going to scale bigger soon enough, bit it doesn't even need to be bitcoin, that's why I specifically said "cryptocurrency", not "bitcoin".

Yes, but the new currency was launched by *pegging it to the old currencies*. If a government wanted bitcoin (or any new currency) to be widely adopted, it could do the same thing and peg bitcoin to the dollar at some fixed exchange rate, then announce that dollars would not be allowed in payment of taxes after some future date. This doesn't mean that bitcoin quickly gained its own network; it means that the dollar network was absorbed into the bitcoin network. 
I should have been a bit clearer. What I meant above was that it wouldn't make sense for the government to launch a currency *with no network of users*, and then require tax payments in that currency, because that currency would be worthless, rendering it impossible to use.

This would not play out the way you describe.
First of all, there's no guarantee that the government can actually confiscate money from any of the top holders.  They've managed to evade hackers for this long, what makes you think they'd be able to steal Roger Ver's or Erik Voorhees' coins?  
Second, if the government throws these guys in jail, I'm not going to sell my bitcoin, I'm just going to make sure I'm more discreet about owning bitcoin, as will everyone else.
Third, a government would not be able to do this without significant public backlash.  Stealing someone's assets is *blatant theft*, unless they are proven to have earned those assets committing a crime.  There is already a lot of outrage in the media over civil asset forfeiture.  If the government suddenly announced, "hey look everyone, we just threw a millionaire in jail for refusing to give us his money!", this would not go over well in the media.  Child porn, drugs, weapons, and murder are generally considered to be bad things.  Owning a certain type of money is not.  The government would first have to convince a majority of people that owning bitcoins should be a crime.

Their business plan is literally to improve bitcoin and then consult because they're domain experts.

This isn't at anyone's expense except for maybe Blockstream's investors. 
All of this ignores the fact that **without these guys, bitcoin would not be where it is today**. Adam Back is cited in Satoshi's whitepaper as the inventor of HashCash, the basis for bitcoin mining.

Oh, I see. I must have misinterpreted the original post. If this is about tracing an individual piece of art back to its proper owner, I can certainly see how the blockchain applies. As long as the artist creates a work, signs a message saying whom it was sold to, and places that message in the blockchain, then theoretically any piece of digital art can have a verifiable lineage. 
I'm not entirely what scenario that would be useful for, though. Perhaps you could explain?

Sure, I'd love to read/watch your source. 
I'm no expert, but my understanding, from reading lots and lots of internets, is that as long as a bank is capable of borrowing enough money overnight to cover the requisite fraction of whatever loans they made during the day, they're solvent. So it makes sense that a bank should be able to "go negative", as it were, as long as they are confident in their ability to make up the difference overnight. 
It's amazing to me that this process is so opaque. I suspect the reason is that there'd be quite a bit of outrage if it were common knowledge that commercial banks create money out of nothing. 
I'd love to work high up at a bank for a day just to know for sure how everything works.

Airbitz! Their wallet has a bunch of features I've never seen on any other wallet, which I think should help spread adoption:
-Your sign in with a username and password/pin instead of a bitcoin address / private key 
-there's a directory of bitcoin accepting businesses nearby inside the app
-it prompts you to label the transaction after you spend, so my transaction list is more like a bank statement and less like a bunch of numbers and letters. 
-you can scan an address from a picture saved on your phone

I'm saying block *announcement* is slower, which means that if a miner finds a block, it takes longer for the block to propagate to the other miners, which incurs a risk that someone else's block will beat it.

False.  Bitcoin's volatility is due to its low liquidity and goods not being priced in bitcoin (which is due to its volatility).  If bitcoin's value increases to match that of large national currencies, and once merchants price goods *in bitcoin* its volatility will be comparable to that of national currencies.
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:27:42
After some consideration, perhaps a better headline would be: "A currency is ideally a network of individuals who have mutually decided on a single commodity which acts as a ledger to keep track what everyone is owed by the users of that network.  This commodity, when presented by the bearer, is thus honored as a claim on any good or service having an equal value to the original debt."
Basically, currency distributes debt to all users of that currency.  When you do something for me that I value, instead of giving something of equal value in return, I can transfer a bit of the network's debt to *me* as a promise that the network will give you something of equal value when you present the certificate of that debt.
The first form of paper currency was gold certificates.  A certificate was simply a promise from a goldsmith that a certain amount of gold would be given to the bearer in exchange for the certificate if the bearer demanded this.  So a currency treats everyone accepting the currency as a decentralized bank which will exchange *anything of value*, rather than just gold, for the certificate when presented.
There are so many was to think about money :)
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:09:34
The reason why no government has generally never worked in the past is because there's never been a truly decentralized form of money, because money has always been violence-based.  With violence-based money, whoever is the most skilled at killing their adversaries gets the most money.  This is obviously harmful to society, robbing the vast majority of their hard-earned wealth and concentrating it into the hands of the elite.  Bitcoin is the first asset that is difficult for the government to seize, at it is purely math-based and (potentially) anonymous.  Thus, the more people that become their own bank, the more difficult it is to keep society's wealth concentrated in the hands of the elite.  Once the government can no longer collect taxes, and once no more money is stored in banks, the old system will simply give way to a peaceful, free market, where ideas and people succeed on their own merit rather than being selected as winners and losers by the elite.

Again with the insults. You seem so sure of yourself and yet, you seem unable to articulate why you think I'm wrong. 


You're right, I did leave that out, didn't I? Silly me... What I mean by "correct monetary policy" is a stable and predictable supply. This is because an expansionary money supply causes malinvestment; a contractionary money supply causes money to be saved rather than loaned; and because sudden swings in the money supply cause bubbles and depressions. So the more stable and predictable a money supply is, the more correct.

@_date: 2018-07-15 14:55:30
You're right, you don't *have* to do anything. I'm just giving you some advice as well as telling you what would be good for the ecosystem. I understand that losing 60% in 7 months is painful. But that's nothing compared to what could happen. 
Remember that in 2013-2015 bitcoin hit $1100 and then bottomed out at $200 and didn't start recovering until late 2015. It took 3 years and 3 months to regain that new $1200 ATH, and lost 80%. But when it comes back, it comes back fast. 
So, again, if you believe in the long-term success of bitcoin, keep accumulating slowly and steadily during the bear market, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and stop complaining that bitcoin is on sale. If you don't believe in the long-term success of bitcoin, then sell everything now, because it could be a while before it goes back up again. But when it does go back up, if you're not already holding, I guarantee you won't be able to buy back in fast enough to take advantage of the gains.

Is it also a fact that they will become the currency of the future? According to your logic it is. 
Yes, I expect altcoins to also be used. However, bitcoin's network effect guarantees that it will be the dominant cryptocurrency until another currency fixes a fundamental flaw with bitcoin. 


Well, more people are invested in bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency, so its infrastructure is being invested in more heavily than any other.

I completely agree.  You should definitely understand any investment you're getting into, and this place can be a bit of a circlejerk sometimes.  The cool thing about bitcoin is that it's open source, so it's actually one of the most transparent investment vehicles out there.  I highly recommend learning as much as you can about why bitcoin works.  Start with [James D'Angelo's World Bitcoin Network YouTube channel]( he's fantastic at explaining everything so that it's understandable.
Armed with this knowledge, ultimately, bad decisions can be made, but you'll immediately know what those bad decisions are, and you'll be able to either influence the process before it becomes fatal, or get your money out.
And whatever you do, *don't* invest more than you're comfortable losing.  Put a little in each month, whatever you don't need for other stuff.  Investing in bitcoin is a wild ride.

As I said, there used to be a time when you could get gold in exchange for dollars. This doesn't make the Fed a store; this makes it a bank. 


Correct, value is entirely subjective, and the best money is that which the greatest number of people can use as a medium of exchange. But again, this does not mean the dollar is *backed* by anything. To say a currency is "backed" by something means that there is some entity that will give you something of more tangible value in exchange for that currency, which is currently untrue of the dollar. The only reason everyone accepts dollars is because that's what everyone else accepts, so it is useful to acquire and hold because other people will accept it in payment for just about anything. But it has no tangible value, and certainly isn't "backed" by anything. 
US Treasuries, on the other hand, are backed by the "full faith and credit of the United States", which is to say that the government will pay you dollars in exchange for your Treasuries, so Treasuries are backed by dollars. Which are not backed by anything.

Stop worrying about the price.  The best thing we can do for bitcoin is quietly accumulate more and more bitcoin while spending as much as we can to help out bitcoin businesses.  If you buy more than you're going to spend every month, there will always be upward pressure on the price.
A currency's value is entirely a consequence of its network effect.  The more people that accept bitcoin in payment for goods and services, the more the objective value of bitcoin will increase.
Seriously, stop worrying about the price.  Worry about the number of users.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:46:09


You aren't going to convince people to hold a currency that's only accepted by a few thousand businesses. The reason the dollar is the most liquid currency is because it has the highest number of users. You're correct that the price goes up the more people hold, but their motivation to hold comes from the belief that they'll be able to spend it on a wide variety of things at a wide variety of places. 


And if you always purchase more than you spend, as I suggested, this is a net gain for the price. Buying $1000 worth of bitcoin at the beginning of the month and spending $500 of that is *good* for the price.


Yelling at people to buy and hold is not going to work. People will buy and hold a currency once it has value, and what gives a currency its value is its *network of users*.

@_date: 2015-09-10 16:46:42
There's nothing on that page to indicate that it can't. The main thing keeping bitcoin from scaling in a decentralized way is that fully validating nodes are currently required to store *the entire blockchain*. This is unnecessary for multiple reasons. The first, as mentioned in the wiki, is that a fully validating node only needs to store the UTXO set, not all transactions. The second is that decentralized, persistent storage is completely possible without storing all data on all nodes. See IPFS, Storj, Maidsafe, and Filecoin for some examples of projects promising to accomplish this *today*. 
If bitcoin were to incorporate something like the projects mentioned above for archiving old data, it would *easily* be able to scale way past VISA's transaction volume. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:11:20


This is only true because we lack the technology for groups of people to make correct decisions efficiently. Money has always sucked, but bitcoin fixes most of its biggest problems.

Fire department: Volunteer fire departments work just fine.  If my fire department were a nonprofit entity (or many), of course I'd donate.
Police: Private security forces work just fine.  Also, the police are doing a [pretty]( [bad]( [job]( these days.  In the private sector, when you murder someone, there is generally some kind of consequence.  Not so with public police forces.
Army/Defense: This isn't necessary unless there's an external government trying to attack you, which only happens when said external government can rob its citizens through taxation and inflation.  Which all of them currently can.  But in case we need to fund our national defense because some external government attacked us, there's no reason we can't crowdfund an army.
Healthcare: give me a break, really?  Let's see what happens when the government [has little or role in healthcare]( 


Whaaaat??  The outcomes for patients in both India and the USA are the same, but the USA spends *two hundred times* more than India?  Wow!  I wonder why theirs is so much cheaper....
Education: Government involvement in education has been [absolutely disastrous]( as measured against its stated goals.  College costs are skyrocketing along with student debt.  This is due to the massive expansion of student loans and other subsidies from *the government*.
As an anecdote, I was homeschooled, and I'm financially independent, reasonably well-informed (in my opinion; you are obviously free to disagree), and literate, as are all of the other homeschoolers I know.  What more can you ask of an education system?  Why does the government need to be involved in education in the first place?  In fact, I'd venture to ask why we even need formalized education in the first place, especially now that there's the Internet just sitting out there for anyone to discover!  I did go to private high school and college, but I didn't learn anything in either place that actually benefits me today, that I couldn't have learned on my own.
Also, Montessori education has been shown to be [superior to government-style education](  Don't you think that if schools were less regulated, allowing a free market of educational systems, that we could zero in on an optimal teaching strategy?  The current strategy of borrowing massive amounts of money and putting everyone into debt for no increase or a decrease in efficacy doesn't seem to be working very well.
Social welfare: Not sure what you mean by this; perhaps you mean "handing money to people"?
Unemployment: The only reason unemployment occurs is because the government does things like set minimum wages, which disallows workers from getting jobs at the market rate.  The government also *heavily* regulates forming a business, to the point that one now usually requires a significant amount of capital to start a business.  Businesses create jobs, jobs make unemployment lower.
One thing I need to note about all of this is that government is part of the problem; the other part of the problem is *banks*, because they rob wealth from everyone and give it to the 1%.  So, if we get rid of government, we also need to *disallow fractional reserve banking*; otherwise the banks will simply set up another government, and that government will be necessary to protect the people from their predatory practices.  This wasn't possible until bitcoin, but now it is :)
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:29:11
And here's bitcoin's little secret: it *can't* be regulated. Governments can try all they want to prevent people from using it, but this will only drive it underground. If governments want what's best for them, they should embrace blockchain technology because it isn't going away, and the places where it's the least regulated will be the places that benefit the most.

Their stated purpose is to develop sidechains. 
Cryptocurrency can be seen as an analogue to packet switching, and bitcoin can be seen as an analogue of ARPANET, a project funded by the US government that would eventually form the basis of today's Internet. Before the introduction of TCP/IP, there were many disparate [packet switched networks]( just as there are many disparate cryptocurrencies today. [It wasn't until ARPANET introduced TCP/IP in the early 80s]( that it became possible to start connecting all of these networks together. Cryptocurrency currently has the problem packet-switched networks had before TCP/IP; that is, they're all disconnected from each other. There is currently no way for a blockchain to trust transactions from another blockchain. Sidechains were proposed as a solution to this exact problem, and thus can be seen as an analogue of TCP/IP. 
The notion that bitcoin core developers should focus only on bitcoin's "core" and not on *connecting* bitcoin to other things is like suggesting that ARPANET should have been focusing on "improving" packet switching within their own network instead of inventing TCP/IP. With internetworking protocols, the onus of innovation isn't on one small group of people; instead, *anyone* is allowed to innovate and contribute value to the entire ecosystem [*without permission*]( This unleashes the productive potential of all participants in the system, leading to exponential growth in the value of the ecosystem. 
ARPANET had the advantage of funding from the US government, but bitcoin has no such luxury. Thus, the fastest way to achieve this "internet of money" is to raise money from private investors, and the fastest way to raise money from private investors is to form a for-profit corporation. It absolutely floors me that people are against this.

But seriously, their economy would be extremely strong. Companies and individuals using bitcoin would be encouraged to move there and create value for that country's economy. It would create instant demand for bitcoin, raising the price globally, in turn benefitting the country.

In the bitcoin economy, hacking and scamming are actually providing value for society, because they drive development of decentralized solutions to these problems.  Mt. Gox's demise was good for bitcoin because it taught people not to trust others with their private keys, and drove the development of proof-of-reserves, as well as multisignature wallets.   
The more people exploit the holes in an open source system, the better and stronger that system gets for everyone.  This is not true of a close-source system.  If you hack a bank, the only people who benefit from the knowledge of that particular exploit are the people working for that particular bank.  Every other bank with a similar exploit will also get hacked because banks don't announce to the world when they get hacked and how it was accomplished.  Bitcoin users *always* do this when their wallets get hacked, and the community usually finds a best practice that was not being followed, which benefits not only the person who was hacked, but *everyone else, too*.
Scamming works similarly.  Trusted third parties are inherently unstable, and the blockchain gives us the ability to minimize trust using smart contracts, escrows, reputation, etc.  It will be a long time before scamming is no longer profitable, but it will happen.
Thus, blockchain technology is driving the development of a society where honesty is more profitable than dishonesty.  We've got a lot of work to do before we're there, but I stand by what I said.  Satoshi found a way to make honesty more profitable than dishonesty.

I just told you a perfectly coherent definition. Bitcoin's *money supply* is stable because the total number of coins is always increasing by about 3600 per day. This rate will drop to 1800/day next year, and will cut in half every 4 years from then on until there are just under 21 million coins. 
The dollar's money supply, on the other hand, looks like this: 
It's volatile and exponential. Thus, compared to the dollar, bitcoin's *supply* is extremely stable. I don't think that can be denied.

This is a common misconception.  Bitcoin is totally anonymous; an address is literally a large random number run through some hashing algorithms.  You're thinking of *the Internet*.  The reason the Internet is not anonymous is because its infrastructure is centralized, giving government agencies the ability to spy on traffic.  Whenever we build the [edgenet]( the Internet will become anonymous, and so will using bitcoin by extension.

Unimpeded business is an ideal that has almost never existed.


Not even remotely true. "My" model is no centralized government, and honest money. 


Adverse conditions like these are an artifact of the fiat money system. You see, our current monetary system naturally creates a huge wealth gap, because the people at the top who control the creation of the money (the banks) can use it to steal wealth from people who don't have much of it. Every time a bank forecloses on a house, this is what is occurring. Every time the economy crashes and the big banks acquire their bankrupt competitors at pennies on the dollar, this is what's happening. The only reason why powerful corporations are a danger to society is *because of the government*. The only reason these parasitic institutions can survive in our market is by manipulating the regulatory processes to enrich themselves and keep competitors out. In a truly free market, these huge corporations would quickly be overrun by smaller, nimbler competitors. But regulations in the name of "protecting the consumer" keep the barrier to entry so high that real competition is impossible. The reason wages were low and working conditions were bad during the Industrial Revolution is because the corporations used their political connections to form cartels and keep their competitors out. 


No. This is precisely what happens when you have government-sanctioned cartels.

Bitcoin's blockchain is responsible for tracking the inputs and outputs of every transaction. After the fork, there will be two diverging transaction histories, effectively creating two different, conflicting versions of bitcoin. Once the chain diverges, it will be valid to spend any coins held before the fork on either chain (and actually, it will be possible to create a transaction that spends the same funds on *both* chains, if replay protection isn't added to 2x). 
Since it's possible to send a transaction which gets confirmed on one chain but not on the other, the supply of bitcoins will essentially double, with the value of each fork being left up to the market. If the market decides that the chains are equal in value, each coin should be worth half of what the pre-fork value was, yielding the same amount of wealth as before the fork. In practice, one fork will probably be valued much more than the other (I've got my money on 1x), and their sum may be greater than the pre-fork value, as we saw with Bcash.
You don't need to do anything to "claim" your new 2x coins once 2x happens; they will simply pop into existence. But if you want to *sell* your 2x coins for 1x coins (or vice versa) there will probably be exchanges where you can send your pre-fork coins and have your exchange account credited with both B2X and BTC. Then you can buy and sell to your heart's content, and withdraw whenever you're satisfied.
A weird situation will occur if replay protection isn't added, where it will actually be difficult to construct a transaction which is valid on one chain but not the other. If this is the case, you may simply see each exchange and service choose which version of the blockchain to follow, while ignoring the other. If this happens, the situation will be very messy, potentially for days after the fork. It's definitely not recommended to send any transactions during this period unless you *absolutely understand what you're doing*.

This is not really true if you think about it. The US government could only use the dollar in payment of taxes because the dollar was already a widely used currency. It wouldn't make sense for the government to make up a new currency and demand tax payments in the new currency. 


Sure, this *adds* to the dollar's value. But it's not where the value initially comes from. It's not what makes dollars different from paper.

You do realize that Ripple's "own money" comes from the banks investing in it? And that $1M is a drop in the bucket to them? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:49:01


Agreed. I guess I'm of the opinion that cryptocurrency solves a fundamental problem with the world, which is that there always needed to be *people* at the top of the power structure, that everyone trusts not to destroy everything. Now, we only need to trust in the natural laws of the universe.  This reverses the current trend and finally makes the forces of decentralization more powerful than the forces of centralization. This makes bitcoin superior to most penny stocks, and in fact, this makes it superior to pretty much any idea since the dawn of civilization. 


I don't know of any yet, but scalability is potentially an issue, though [many are confident]( it's not a fundamental problem. The biggest threat I see to bitcoin is that of mining centralization. If a new currency comes out that fixes this, you can be sure I'll be investing in it :)

I would definitely not assume that Trump knows what Aleppo is.
Also, Gary Johnson has climbed all Seven Summits; that is, he's reached the point of highest elevation on all seven continents (including Mt. Everest).  He's definitely not a pothead (although he's the CEO of a cannabis business), and has pledged to abstain from cannabis while in office.  He's a self-made entrepreneur and was a popular governor of New Mexico for two terms, re-elected as a *very* fiscally conservative Republican despite the state being Democrat.
Sure, he's not the "perfect" candidate, and he's certainly not the best at media interviews, but to me, that's pretty much the least important factor in what makes a good President.  He's smart, principled, and has a real life outside of being a politician.  I'm supporting him because he's literally the only Presidential candidate this election advocating a smaller federal government.

I am unaware of these "constant bitcoin talking points" you speak of; I'm simply expressing my opinion. It's not that banks are "tech phobic", it's that smart engineers are generally not going to work for the financial sector. I'm speaking from experience as an engineer.

It all depends on if you can be considered a money services *business*, in which case you have to register with FinCEN (at least, in the US). If you sell bitcoins once, probably no one will care. If you do it a lot, in large amounts, eventually someone will probably buy drugs with the coins you sold them. Since the public always wants *someone* to suffer for the evils of drugs, that makes you the low-hanging fruit.

True, but most people are apathetic because most people basically trust the government. They assume that if the government does something evil that there's some greater good being served. This is because whenever the government does something unequivocally evil, they destroy the evidence. There are numerous examples of the government destroying data that would have proven the nonexistence of this "greater good", and shaken the public's trust in the government.

I've already addressed your question. No one needs to "run" the Internet. There just needs to be people running mesh networking software on their phones. Bitcoin transactions can be relayed over radio, so we actually don't even need the Internet.

Not really. You could have gotten the picture from anywhere on the Internet, or photoshopped it. Bitcoin allows you to sign a message with your private key, guaranteeing that the message came from the owner of the private key and therefore the address. 
When someone here says, "hey, I own X amount of bitcoin", and someone else says, "Oh yeah? Prove it!", they're not asking for the person to prove their *real-life identity*; they're simply asking that the owner of the reddit account prove that he/she is indeed the owner of the amount of coins claimed. 
You are obviously correct that connecting your real-life identity to your bitcoins by definition removes the anonymity of the situation. This point is inconsequential and irrelevant.

Your question creates a false dichotomy. Services the government renders are necessary for the proper functioning of society, but it's not necessary for those services all to be rendered by a *centralized government*. They could be provided by the free market. 
The answer to your question, however, is the threat of violence, and the freedom of choice. It sounds like you think donating to the Red Cross is somehow the same as paying taxes. Well maybe it is for you, but personally I like having the option of not donating if a bad job is being done.

I agree that all of the centralized institutions that are draining the life out of the world once had value, and a purpose. Not long ago, it made sense for a handful of people to make all of the decisions because the average person had no access to information necessary to make good decisions. But since the rise of the Internet, centralization of power no longer makes sense since everyone has equal access to whatever information they need in order to make rational decisions. People are, by and large, still very misinformed but, at least in the West, this is largely due to lack of utilization of the available information. Younger generations continually improve upon older ones in this regard. And despite this, the Internet has enabled communities to make more intelligent decisions in a decentralized way than just having the same 5 or 10 people make decisions. Reddit is a good example of how the wisdom of crowds can be harnessed to bring the most valuable content to the forefront of the discussion. Imagine if companies made decisions based on popular content in a subreddit. When everyone is allowed access to all the information, a crowd will unfailingly make better decisions than a single person or small group of people. 
Before the Internet, this was not possible. Now, it is inevitable.

That's not a problem if there are lots and lots of high-risk/reward opportunities.  Just look at the altcoin space.  There are assets bubbling all the time.  After 3 or 4, you get the hang of it.  And the number and variety of things to invest in keeps expanding.  If there are only a few things to invest in, you'll have much less opportunity to succeed.  But if there are thousands or millions of small-cap assets that might blow up, the average joe has a much bigger playground on which to gain experience, and many more opportunities to strike gold.  
The reason buying shares in the stock exchange is nowhere close to this is because there are so few good investment opportunities, and the space is so highly regulated.  This makes it boring and pointless to invest in.  The best you can expect from investing in a company that has already IPO'd is maybe a two or three times increase over the span of years.  Conversely, the altcoin space regularly has assets that multiply by 5 or 10 in the space of a week.  And the pace of new assets being introduced is accelerating.

False. 
First, because most wealth will be virtual, the cost of attack will be greater than the cost of defense. This will deter virtually all war. There's just not much to be gained by attacking another state, and the war is likely to drag on for a long time. 
Second, because individuals will be highly mobile, if they envy a neighboring community's prosperity, they don't need to attack that community and take its resources; they can simply move there. 
Third, war produces widespread mortal danger. Again, because citizens will be highly mobile, if a state goes to war with another state, the citizens of both states have a huge incentive to simply leave. 
Fourth, the only reason wars happen today is because power is centralized within the hands of a wealthy few, and they go to war because they know they can do so without risking their own lives or even their own money. They can simply throw the lives of other people into the war. If a government could not forcibly rob its citizenry through taxes and inflation, war would simply not happen because the citizens would have to agree that the war was a good idea and *invest their own money and lives into the war*. I very much doubt that this would ever happen, especially given the above points.

Yes! Now you're getting it! Printing new money is *seignorage*.


Yes! Again, agreed. 


Yes, I'm not talking about *miners' individual revenue*, I'm talking about the revenue *of the entire bitcoin system, in aggregate*. Miners are only *part* of the bitcoin system, just as the banks that receive new money from the central bank are only *part* of the fiat system. When the Fed prints a bunch of new dollars, this doesn't make the dollar more valuable, it simply transfers value from everyone holding dollars to those who printed the new money. 
When I talk about revenue, I'm considering the entire bitcoin system as though it were a company, because this is the only logical way to think about user engagement. If more users are interacting with the system, then the system is worth more. Likewise, if users are paying more in aggregate to use the system, then the system is worth more. The block reward is a horrible metric of user engagement because it is *literally not affected by user engagement*.

I hadn't read the whole roadmap, that's very comforting. If the core devs keep on top of adoption, transaction fees may stay low. 


Well, for one thing, litecoin's blocks only need to be 1/4 the size of bitcoin's blocks, so block announcement is much faster for litecoin than bitcoin at comparable volumes. Also, I'm not saying that litecoin would replace bitcoin, but that it could take over smaller transactions. 2 blockchains used in parallel are obviously more scalable than just one. Scalability becomes even better the higher the number of altcoins used.

I'm sorry, but this is absolutely meaningless. Saying that a currency is backed by "the full faith and credit" of some entity does not magically guarantee its value. If I give you a piece of paper that says "100 dibs" on it, and then I tell you that I guarantee its value with my "full faith and credit", does that magically imbue the piece of paper with value? Of course not. 


Listen to yourself! What the hell does this even mean?? A legal obligation to do what, exactly?

...No, getting rich is selling something useful to people.  If they value what you're selling, you make money.  If what you're selling is not valuable, you don't get rich.


Yes, rich people are those who provide relatively more useful things to others.  Poor people provide relatively less useful things.

Yes, which you presumably *earned, fair and square*, by producing something of equal value.  I'd say that the people who provide useful things to society should get more money than people who provide less useful things to society, wouldn't you?

Every bitcoin transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs (with the exception of the first transaction of every block, the "coinbase transaction", which grants the miner of the block newly created coins). Inputs are outputs from previous transactions. If you create a new wallet and receive a payment of 10 btc and then a payment of 20 btc, your wallet can now spend 30 btc, but it must use either the 10 btc input or the 20 btc input from the received transactions to construct your first outgoing transaction. So even if you want to only spend 1 btc, the input will probably be your 10 btc transaction. Since 10 btc is more than you're trying to spend, you'll need to create two outputs, one of 1 btc to spend, and one of (almost) 9 btc to send back to yourself as "change". I say "almost" 9 btc because you'll want to include a miner fee, otherwise your transaction will never be confirmed. The difference between the output value of a transaction and the input value (that is, the leftover input coins which were not sent to outputs) goes to the miner who mines the block containing your transaction. So, if you send 1 btc to someone else and 9 btc to yourself as change using a 10 btc input, there's no input money left over for the fee. So you'll need to make a change output of maybe 8.9999 instead of 9. That way, the miner will receive the leftover 0.0001 that was not sent anywhere. 
Sorry for the long explanation, hopefully you find it useful.

If you wanted to use the same wallet to spend 25 btc, then you would need to use both the 10 btc output *and* the 20 btc output as inputs to your transaction, sending 25 to someone else as an output, as well as (almost) 5 btc back to yourself as change in a second output. 
The reason the number of inputs affects the miner fee you'll need to pay is because the more inputs you use, the bigger your transaction will be in bytes. Since miners are trying to utilize the 1 MB maximum block size as efficiently as possible to maximize the fees they receive, a transaction that is 2 KB will need to include twice the fee of a transaction of only 1 KB to have the same chance of making it into the next block. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:32:28
You have to look at incentives. People aren't incentivized to use bitcoin yet because most *other* people aren't using it. The thing that will make people use it is for its value to continue increasing over the long term, which will draw in more holders, which will drive the value up, which will result in more people accepting it, which will result in more people holding it, etc. It's a virtuous cycle that has no end, barring some better form of crypocurrency coming along and supplanting bitcoin, which would be all right with me. As long as I get out in time :P

The activation logic is in the next release, and other softforks didn't take nearly a year to activate.  6 months would be a conservative estimate.  Unless miners try to block it, I suppose.


Why can't these be done in parallel?  In fact, why do we even have to wait for segwit to activate before discussing and coding the hard fork?  
[Matt Corallo]( says there were "a number of private discussions around the issues involved, including several new hard fork rollout proposals" at last week's Scaling Bitcoin conference.  They're *already* talking about it.

Because bitcoin brashly proposes a completely new system that gets rid of banks, governments, arbitrary inflation, and the prevailing mainstream economics. Not only has it done all this, but it's been succeeding and growing rapidly pretty much since it was released.
Its one thing to question the established order; it's another thing entirely to build something that will either destroy the established order or die, and have it continuously gaining in popularity for 6 years. The longer bitcoin stays alive, the more seriously people are forced to take it.

No. There don't need to be "world political structures". The separation of money and state will lead to much smaller, more efficient states, which are dependent on the voluntary contributions of their customers, because no forced taxation will be possible. Thus, wars of aggression will be extremely unlikely, and huge nation-states with massive militaries will be rendered unnecessary. 


At the global scale, we already live in a state of anarchy. Stability is maintained by the United States military having the ability to decisively win a military conflict against any other nation-state, and this situation is becoming less stable by the day as the global financial system eats itself. We don't need a top-down, global system of voting and incentives for the entire world to come to consensus about things. We just need to drastically reduce the incentives for violence, which is *what bitcoin already does*, by taking control of money away from the state. Once we no longer have incentives for war, global stability will be self-sustaining. Attack will cost more than defense, because the majority of the world's wealth will be *virtual* and thus immune to physical violence. It will also be highly distributed, because, as we've seen, the more bitcoin one holds, the more likely one is to be hacked. 
What I'm trying to say is that bitcoin has started a revolution that will inevitably lead to a more peaceful, prosperous world. We don't need to do anything to make sure this happens, other than perhaps to ensure that the ecosystem keeps growing.

Yes! This is a wonderful explanation of how markets work, and I agree that hyperinflation may follow deflation. First, everyone will run to the dollar because it's the "safest" asset. Once everything else has crashed, the dollar will officially be in a *cosmically epic* bubble, especially if the USG starts abusing its position as printer of the reserve currency (more than it already does). 
Actually, if the Fed allows interest rates to rise once all the other currencies are dying, they could possibly avert a hyperinflation event. And the dollar will be strong enough at that point that the Fed may be able to let interest rates rise without hurting the USG's ability to spend. 
But the timing would need to be impeccable, and they probably wouldn't have the balls to let interest rates rise as the global financial system is collapsing. Of course, if the Fed allows interest rates to rise, that would make the national debt much harder to pay off, increasing the likelihood of a default. But it's possible that the USG would be able to continue borrowing money for a long time. 
Also, if individuals worldwide start using fiat currencies less, the dollar may not get any more transactional demand because people may not start using it in place of their old currency. Not sure if that matters. 
And, there may be no assets to run to if bitcoin hasn't matured enough by the time everything falls apart. Or, it could be the catalyst for a hyperinflation event as everyone realizes that the dollar is being printed faster and faster. 
Just trying to see the future. So many different ways this could go. Unfortunately it seems like chaos and war may be unavoidable :/

Actually, it has demand because it has users, and it has users because it started out as gold, and was slowly debased into its current form over a period of centuries.  The government cannot create a new currency and decree that the new currency has value, and expect the market to just magically comply.  A new currency must be convertible into an old currency, at least at first, otherwise it will never carry value.

@_date: 2016-10-09 16:26:03


No, this is one part of bitcoin transferring value to another part of bitcoin.  It's an *internal* transfer, rather than a transfer of value into the system from outside.  It's the holders paying the miners.  It would be like a startup taking money from its bank account to pay its employees.  It doesn't add to the value to the system.  Fees, on the other hand, increase bitcoin's value as they represent *users paying for a service*.  This would be like a startup charging a fee for a service, like Uber charging you for a ride.  This counts as revenue because the value is being received *from outside the system*, and thus it adds to the system's overall value.


That's not how it works.  The *miners* didn't hike the fees, the *users* did.  People started paying a higher fee because they were willing to in order to get their transactions confirmed quickly.


It's not more expensive to use than alternate forms of payment...


Actually, I think the fees can go *much* higher before they stop.  Personally, I'd be willing to pay $1 fees if I'm transferring $50.


I said two *years*...

3) "Get hacked?  Your money is gone." - how is this not the case with any of the other options?  Yes, there are chargebacks, but these aren't 100% successful, and they pour a large percentage of each payment down the drain in the form of fraud protection.
4) Related to the above, no mention is made of the fact that bitcoin is a much cheaper and much more secure system than all of the other options.

Uh... I deposited $100 yesterday. So, my personal experience refutes this statement. 


I very much disagree with this. First of all, bitcoin can't really do what ChangeTip does, by itself. Transaction fees would eat away a huge percentage of the tips. Second, ChangeTip can be shut down, and if bitcoin adoption explodes, ChangeTip could end up being a threat to basically all banks. You can bet they won't be happy about that. This will force a decentralized solution. I don't see ChangeTip as permanently taking over the Internet payments space, they're more like a stopgap until something better comes along. 
And the ChangeTip bots/"spam" don't bother me. I don't know why you think they're not good for bitcoin. They're piquing users' curiosity, from what I can tell. And the more people we have researching bitcoin, the better.

Well sure, by the prevailing definition ("price deflation"), which is not the original definition of deflation. The original definition is now known as ["monetary deflation"]( which refers to a contraction of the money supply. Falling prices are an *effect* of monetary deflation. But that's just semantics and I'll concede that your definition is currently more widely used. 


My point does not require that you accept my definition of deflation. My point is that you consider a currency whose supply never increases to be a bad thing. I'm curious to know why, as this would be the same thing as simply using gold as a currency, which has been done successfully for millenia.


Yes, you are. Remember when you said, 


..? You're making it sound as though a deflationary economy would be dysfunctional in some way, when there are plenty of historical examples of price deflation in conjunction with economic prosperity, such as 19th century America. This price deflation was caused by technological advancement, which made everything cheaper and anyone with savings prosperous. 


Obviously not; I'm down if you're down. But you still haven't answered *my* original question, which is, do you think that technological advancement is bad? Because it seems to me that you do.

Only in the presence of government-controlled currency. In a "real" free market (i.e. the crypto economy) the only monopolies that can survive are enterprises that are *actually* providing a valuable service to their customers. The only reason large, harmful monopolies and cartels exist today is because they are protected by the financial sector and the government, which print as much money as they want. This allows them to crush challengers who would provide better services for lower prices. 


I disagree. 
Peace is incentivized by removing the incentives for violence. 
Cooperation is incentivized insofar as it is valuable, as is competition. Both are useful in different contexts. 
Profit is the only thing that produces wealth in a society. Without profit, there would be no entrepreneurs, and without entrepreneurs, there would be no businesses. Without businesses, again, there would be no wealth. 
Market control would be possible insofar as it is actually useful to society. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 14:52:56


No. The block reward is not revenue, it's seignorage.  It's a transfer of value from the holders to the miners.  It does not in any way reflect usage.  Fees *are* revenue, because it's a transfer of value from the *users* to the miners, for services rendered.


The graph shows that fee revenue (and thus demand) is skyrocketing *now*.  Why in the world would you expect it to stay the same?


The fee rate should rise until it's more than users are willing to pay, and then it will fall until it's cheap, then it will rise again.  Eventually equilibrium will be reached, but demand will always continue to go up as more and more users join the network. The more users join the network, the more valuable the network becomes, and thus the more  people are willing to pay in order to use the network. 
Also, with the Lightning Network rolling out over the next couple of years, the value of the network will explode as it will be able to support a much higher number of users at a much lower cost, drawing business away from legacy payment systems.

Bitcoin the payment system.  The US dollar is not a payment system.  Bitcoin the payment system is competing against VISA the payment system.  Once its revenue is greater than that of VISA, we'll know people value it more in aggregate.  Fees are people putting their money where their mouth is.  It's a solid metric for determining the overall demand for bitcoin.


If you understand supply and demand, the answer to this question should be clear.

Bitcoin's consensus rules are governed by the consent of the miners. What any one implementation does is irrelevant if the miners don't run that implementation. 
I think the debacle with wireless standards could have been prevented by regulatory bodies taking a less intrusive role in the technology.

No, which is why I facepalm whenever I hear this. One of the main innovations of bitcoin was paying the transaction processing nodes in new units of the currency.  AFAIK, there are no examples of a successful blockchain that doesn't do this. You'd need some other way to incentivize miners to process transactions honestly, and since cryptocurrency is the only form of money not controlled by a single entity, using it as the incentive is the only way to ensure that the blockchain is incorruptible. Any other incentive would quickly centralize control over the blockchain. One could argue that if Satoshi has a million coins, then he could pay miners to attack the blockchain for a long time; however, this strategy is prevented by game theory, given that he'd be destroying his own wealth in the process. I just don't see a way around this as things stand currently. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:35:18
Interest in bitcoin is driven by price, which is driven by time (up) and investors' emotions (all over the place). So, expect bitcoin to bubble bigger and bigger until it rivals national currencies and becomes a widely used medium of exchange, since that's the only thing that can realistically put the bubbling to an end. The only other thing that could happen is that some other cryptocurrency becomes more valuable than bitcoin. But as the value of a decentralized ledger is directly related to the amount of time it's been around, I don't really expect this to happen.

Sure, but again, money should be a ledger of debts.  When I deposit $1,000 into a bank, that bank creates (say) $9,000 to lend out at interest.  This distorts the "ledger of debts" concept because that $9,000 is an entry in the ledger saying that society as a whole owes the bank $9,000, when really, the bank didn't do anything worth that much to anyone.

Interesting idea! The problem with using it for bitcoin mining is that someone needs to maintain a "list" of all of the expected participants. With surveys this makes sense because there exists a type of survey where the respondents are all in a preselected group, such as in a classroom setting. But, I don't believe this tech is applicable to surveys where anyone can participate, which is closer to how mining works.

Bitcoin is a new type of constitution that differs from the legacy version in two ways:

This is a stupid concept I keep hearing, that somehow it's unfair that early adopters are rich. Bitcoin *would not succeed* without early adopters; the only incentive to buy and hold bitcoins is because of the crazy chance you might multiply your investment a thousandfold or more. If Satoshi is a trillionaire someday because he invented a brilliant new protocol that replaces our current vampiric financial system with a trustless, fair, frictionless financial system, and automates the jobs of all the lawyers, politicians, and bankers, then I say *more power to him*. If Roger Ver ends up a trillionaire because he helped it succeed, *more power to him, too!*

Bitcoin micropayments will enable countless untold services that charge by the KB or hour or anything for instant, anonymous usage.

True, but the problem is that, if you're a business that sells bitcoin for cash and *doesn't invade their customers' privacy*, you can be caught and jailed for doing this through stings, just as you can with any other illegal business. Once you get on the wrong side of the law, life becomes much harder. So yes, it's easy to spend and accept cash every day if you're doing small transactions and your business is not especially illegal, but if your business is *money transmission without a license* and you're easy to find, you're screwed. 


If I were a bitcoin business, I'd do the same, wouldn't you? Look at what happened to Faiella and Shrem. These guys are scared of harassment and jail time. 


That's because there's a limited number of things you can do with physical cash. Money is much more powerful when it's electronic, and is actually subject to different rules (currency exchange vs money transmission). Thus, exchanging cash for bitcoin is much more akin to sending cash via Western Union than to trading one stack of fiat cash for another. There's a reason why Shrem got in trouble with the law.

Great article. I just have one nit:


Please, everyone, stop using this phrase. It does not mean anything. 
The correct word is "pseudonymous", which refers to the property of bitcoin where an address is a pseudonym; that is, an identity consisting of a group of connected transactions. Since an address is only accessible via knowledge of a specific private key, we assume that all transactions spent from that address were spent by the same person. This is the extent of what can be gleaned about your identity purely from the blockchain. In the absence of personally identifiable information, this is equivalent to anonymity, which is the ability to transact without revealing your real-world identity. In practice, many bitcoin addresses are connected to real-world identities, so it's a bit tricky to maintain pure anonymity.

One of the great things about ChangeTip is it tells you when someone doesn't have a ChangeTip account and ignores your tip. So it's very easy to collect data on what works and what doesn't. The other useful thing ChangeTip does is it expires tips that get ignored, and warns you it's going to do this ahead of time. I've noticed that if I tip at least a dollar, pretty much everyone signs up for an account to accept the tip. I don't know if this makes them "bitcoin stalwarts", but it at least gets them to check it out, which I think makes the whole thing worth it. 


I generally tip only on content I enjoy. The person technically *does* have to earn it by doing something awesome. Thus, your flyer analogy doesn't fly. It's more like a high five to someone doing something cool, or you know, a tip. 


Changetip does not allow you to "avoid eye contact". You either sign up and accept the tip before it expires, or you ignore it for two weeks. Eye contact does not last for two weeks. 


And I heartily disagree with you, based on my personal experience. I've gotten plenty of people curiously asking me for more information. I've never gotten a negative response.

As a rule of thumb, don't trust the media.  A majority of information on bitcoin in the media is either oversimplified, or simply not true.  Use Google, the bitcoin wiki, this subreddit (mostly), and your own common sense.

No, I'm making a stronger claim than that. I'm saying that it's possible to create a bitcoin transaction *without connecting any personally identifiable information whatsoever* to the transaction. It's possible to relay a bitcoin transaction over radio, for instance. *The Internet* is not anonymous, but that is a property of *the Internet*, not a property of bitcoin. 
Dash (and cash) is the same. If I use the Internet to send a dash transaction, that transaction is (possibly) not anonymous. The fact that transactions are more or less disconnected from each other does not increase the *anonymity* of the network, only the *privacy* of your transactions.

@_date: 2015-03-01 18:21:43


What are the drawbacks to bearer instruments? 


You mean people use cash because ACH sucks so much? 


Sure, there are some services that could be seen as competitors to bitcoin. Time will tell who wins. 


I was referring to smartphone *bitcoin* wallets, which are not centralized. Yes, Google wallet is cool. Is it anonymous? No. Is bitcoin? Maybe.


What I think will solve this problem is bitcoin's constantly rising price. It's possible that we'll never have another bubble higher than Dec. 2013, but if the price keeps going up, there will eventually be a demand from holders whose coins have appreciated. 




Yeah, I really think the infrastructure isn't in place yet, but it's being built out faster every year. 


That's not the picture I had in mind. In my mind, microtransactions are less than a cent. Everyone will be able to afford this. 


If bitcoin tipping goes global, a million cents is still $10,000. Sure, it's ineffective now, but wait until tons of people are using it. If that happens.

@_date: 2015-03-24 15:04:35
Yeah, I see fractional reserve banking as going the way of the dodo once cryptocurrency is widely used. Banks have only a few uses: storing things securely, sending money electronically to someone else, and acting as a middleman between investors and investments. Bitcoin/crowdfunding supersedes all of these functions except safe deposit boxes. Plus, as you said, there's no way to bail out a bank if it fails. So basically, bitcoin will finally kill the banks because it increases the risks of using them while offering a cheap, easy alternative. 
I expect there to be a period where lots of banks try this anyway, though.

@_date: 2015-03-23 21:44:20
It's because blockchain technology is a revolutionary technology which creates infinite possibilities by solving the previously impossible problem of transacting without a middleman.  Either you see it or you don't.  If you don't, people who see it look crazy.  People on the Internet love telling people they think are crazy that they're crazy.  People also don't like being called crazy, so naturally this makes them angry, which leads to flaming.  Reddit minimizes this (compared to other platforms), but it still happens.

The are all kinds of investments where you can't withdraw your money for months or even years, like certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, etc. You just need to transfer over the amount of money you need for day-to-day expenses, and refill once it runs low. If fees keep rising, I'll just transfer larger amounts, less often. Yes, there is a point where it will no longer be worth it, but I think we're a long way away from that point for most people. If I can transfer money every 3 months, that's still worth it to me given the promise of the Lightning Network and other privacy/scalability improvements.

Because that would violate net neutrality. There was a great comment somewhere on Reddit addressing this, which I can't find right now, but basically peering agreements traditionally involve two networks sharing data back and forth between their users, and are usually free or low cost because of the mutually beneficial nature of this connection. Since Netflix is a massive one-way pipe, though, service providers wanted to charge them more for essentially abusing their peering connections, but Netflix got all their customers to angrily yell at the FCC to stop this capitalistic nonsense. So basically, Net Neutrality, as defined by the current dialogue, is the inability to charge more for customers who are abusing their connections.

You should read [The Sovereign Individual](  The world is changing.  Politics will diminish in importance as a new free market in governance emerges from the old system of nation-states.  State policy will be determined increasingly by the "customers" of the state (that is, the entrepreneurs it protects) as the Information Age erodes the incentives for violence.  Especially once enough people are using bitcoin, governments will lose control over money, their primary source of power.
I understand your concern about even bitcoin having politics of its own, but bitcoin has competitors.  If it becomes inefficient, it will be disrupted by nimbler competitors.  But it's an open system, and I just don't see that happening.

Watch the first three talks of this segment of Scaling Bitcoin if you think Lightning is "vague and far in the future": 
Lightning is one of the most active areas of development, with lots of real code working now. Segwit will provide enough of a capacity boost to tide us over until lightning is ready. Also, lighting relies upon segwit being active.

Nope, *Satoshi* got £15. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:17:01
I disagree.  Banks *are* evil.  The people that work for them, perhaps not.  But the system itself creates centralization pressures, and centralization creates perverse incentives, and perverse incentives are what make people do evil things.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:15:29
This sounds right, but I'm not sure. In that case, the solution is to wait until everyone uses segwit, then deprecate non-segwit, then raise the block size. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:50:07
So did I. The core devs don't control the block size limit. The miners do. Anyone can be a miner. 
Anyone can be a core dev too, for that matter.

I don't know about you, but I don't use bitcoin transactions for "economic activity".  I use it as a savings account, and I use Coinbase as my debit account.  If someone accepts bitcoin, great, but I mostly only use on-chain transactions for transfers to Coinbase.  This does not mean I'm going to sell all my bitcoin, because bitcoin's current throughput has little to do with its value.  You are correct that bitcoin's value comes partly from people speculating about being able to use it for all sorts of cool things *in the future*, but mostly it's about *financial sovereignty*, or being able to be my own bank.  Sure, my little bank can't do much right now, but at least my assets can't be frozen or seized at the whim of some bureaucrat.  And with each passing year, my bank will be able to do more and more awesome things.  If you think that throughput is the reason for bitcoin's value, I invite you to trade your bitcoins for litecoins.  I hear that chain is going to have the Lightning Network very soon :)

Yeah, but where would you put it? If the operator is anonymous, law enforcement will simply go after whoever operates the facility it's in. You can't just put a bitcoin ATM in a park and run away. 
Besides, a bitcoin ATM requires a lot of attention to keep running. You need to make sure it has enough cash for people selling and enough bitcoin for people buying. You need to physically visit the machine every now and then to make sure it's still working properly, and to withdraw cash. What you're proposing is not at all practical. 
That's not to say there isn't a way, but if it's so easy, why not do it yourself?

Cool! One of the wonderful things about bitcoin is that pretty much all the code is open source, but the coins are highly distributed, meaning that every wallet is basically a security bug bounty. If a bank gets hacked, they say, whoops, we fixed it and we'll try not to fuck up again. If a bitcoin wallet gets hacked, the failure is analyzed exhaustively and publicly, ensuring that that exact same hack is less likely in the future.

I'm sorry that you can't see bitcoin's potential, yet. As much as you seem to like the idea that the Internet was seen as "promising" in the 80s, the fact is that many people dissed the Internet as useless, some [as recently as 1998]( The problems with the Internet in the 80s are *precisely* the problems bitcoin is having now; that is, it's hard to use, and not that many people are using it. The number of users is slowly increasing every day, the number of bitcoin businesses solving vital infrastructure issues is mounting, and the amount of venture capital being poured into this new Internet of Money is [exploding](

What does this even mean? If you produce stuff and sell it for bitcoin and someone buys it, that's a fair transaction. What difference does it make if some random third party holds a lot of bitcoin? 


Again, what are you talking about? Roger Ver has nothing to do with your productivity. You're handing over your productivity for bitcoin, which you can then hand over to someone else for something of equal value. Large holders not involved in any way. 


Can you explain this? A currency is given value by the expectation that others will accept the currency in exchange for valuable things. 


What do you mean by this? Again, bitcoin's value is derived from the stuff other people are willing to trade you for it. 
They are produced because an algo said so, whoever was on the early receiving end is now at a substantial advantage over late comers. In a hypothetical bitcoin economy, late comers are forced to compete with their *labor* for spare satoshis. 
I don't think this would happen. Rich holders don't simply sit on their coins... What's the point of having a whole bunch of bitcoins if you never spend them? And if you never spend them, that effectively removes your coins from the money supply, making everyone else's coins worth more. 


Can you explain how this "deflation mechanism" works? You realize that deflation means everyone's money appreciates at the same time, right? 


I wholeheartedly disagree with this assessment. The "oligarch class" you refer to is simply a bunch of guys who are heavily invested in bitcoin and therefore are working as hard as they can to see it succeed. Every holder of bitcoin, whether large or small, benefits from this.  And if income inequality ever gets so bad that it's hard to get by, people will simply switch to a different currency, destroying the wealth of the early adopters. Bitcoin is not like fiat.

OP is saying that bitcoin is anonymous unless you tie your transaction to your real-world identity (which is true).  Buying something online and having it shipped to you obviously breaks this anonymity, as you're tying your real-world address to a transaction.  The sender of the "gun" actually has more anonymity than the receiver, as the return address does not need to be real.
I was responding to who was asking how to spend bitcoins anonymously.  Mixing services would be one way to do this.  You don't need to get something shipped to you.  And if you do, it can be something legal.
But yes, I agree in general that if you buy a physical item, there is no way to reliably remain anonymous, since the sender will always know your address, and LE can figure out who you are from your address if they happen to get the sender to tell them what it is.  
That's why we need an Uber for parcel deliveries.  That way your receiving location can be transient, like HD bitcoin addresses.

I understand.  I was merely pointing out an incorrect usage of the phrase "at worst".

@_date: 2015-03-27 19:04:04


This is backwards. Governments derive their power from their control of fiat money, which has value because it's widely accepted as payment. Once people realize that fiat is worthless, governments will no longer have any power. 


These are not appropriate analogies, because the market would never accept a monopoly on food, and brooms are still useful in lots of situations. However, once a currency is deemed less valuable than other currencies, its value will plummet, causing a death spiral in which no one wants to be left holding the bag, so everyone sells, driving the value down even further. Eventually you literally can't find anyone who accepts it. This is what will happen to fiat currencies once cryptocurrency is widely perceived as fundamentally superior. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:09:12
IMO, rollercoasterguy should not be used to speculate.  He should just be a weathervane telling us where bitcoin is moving rapidly now.
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:34:05








What's the significance of this? First of all, bitcoin is the first *digital* bearer instrument, which makes it fundamentally superior to all previous bearer instruments. Why *wouldn't* people adopt it? Also, people still widely use cash in transactions, at least in the US. 


This is a problem that is being slowly solved by the open source community. 


I think smartphone wallets are way easier than credit cards. But that's just me. 


I don't think that's what will cause consumer adoption. Consumer adoption will be driven by merchant adoption, which is most certainly driven by the savings on fees.


Sure, so it's a wash for consumers, especially at brick-and-mortar merchants. It doesn't matter much in the long run... there are plenty of other awesome use cases being built up: microtransactions instead of ads, cheap overseas remittances, a more private way to transact, etc. All of these things are weaknesses, yes, but they can be and are being overcome. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:14:45
I agree that merchants definitely have use cases now.  I'm talking about your average consumer, though, who isn't a merchant.  Once a critical mass of businesses are accepting bitcoin, it'll make more sense for the average user to own some.

@_date: 2016-05-16 17:51:03
Right, but even paper money is in the same category as bitcoin, as it's possible to anonymously *and* it's possible to use non-anonymously. There is no conceivable system that is more anonymous than this, as it's *always* possible to connect personally identifiable information to your transaction. For example, if I pay in cash and don't wear a mask, I've connected my face to the transaction. So, while cash may arguably be *easier to use anonymously*, it is not *more anonymous*. Does that make sense?

Right, to restore the private keys contained in it, simply locate the folder where core stores wallet.dat and replace it (making sure to back it up also, if it contains any money) with your unencrypted backup containing the old funds. Start up bitcoin core and wait for it to sync, and your funds should be ready to spend. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:11:57
Not sure this addresses my point? The fact that it happened proves that exchanges are vital to the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:40:04
Yeah, and there weren't too-big-to-fail banks. A fractional reserve banking system, if left unchecked, will always lead to central banks and state capture because of the centralization pressures inherent in a system in which the bigger the institution, the more leverage it has and the larger percentage of the money supply it owns. The more of the money supply is controlled by the banking system, the less is available for use to the general public, and the more "necessary" it is for people to get loans to start businesses and do more and more normal things. If banks didn't control so much of the money supply, it wouldn't be necessary for people to get a loan to start a business, or buy a home or a car. These activities would be possible to fund with just equity for the majority of people. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:23:11

You're right that it'd be more unfair if this were a violence-based financial system like the current fiat system... but bitcoin ownership is enforced entirely by math, not violence. Owning more fiat allows you to be more violent, which allows you to get more fiat, but owning more bitcoin does not allow you to math better. With bitcoin, the only dishonest ways to get more bitcoin are scamming and hacking, neither of which are easier if you own more bitcoin. The vast majority of users are thus incentivized to earn more bitcoin only by honest means, including the superrich.

Without AML/KYC laws, buying bitcoin from a bitcoin ATM would be as easy as withdrawing cash from a legacy ATM. The only way to fix this "problem with bitcoin" is to ignore AML/KYC laws, which is dangerous for ATM operators. This is not to say that there's no workaround to these onerous laws, but my claim that this is a problem with fiat cannot be denied.

Actually, it seems as though it's news *about the price* that has the biggest effect on the price. This is a result of bitcoin's role as speculative, secure store of value. When the price is going up fast, bitcoin's perceived utility is also going up fast, and vice versa.

Correct! No one is forcing miners to follow Core. Thus, the miners only follow Core if there's a rough consensus *among miners* that Core's code is the best code. The Classic situation illustrates this point. If the miners decide that Classic is better, they'll mine that instead. Since they haven't, it can be assumed that they still like Core better.

Ask yourself why bitcoin has any value at all.   I see two main drivers:
- Since bitcoin is traded on unregulated markets, the answer must be that there are people who aren't willing to sell bitcoin at *any* price.  So, the absolute baseline market cap of bitcoin is roughly the sum of all of the money that has been invested in bitcoin, with no intention of selling.  This number can go down if people lose faith in bitcoin, and it can go up if more people are convinced that it has long term value.  Bitcoin's *actual* market price is determined by people who think the value will go up between when the buy and when they sell or spend.  So if the price goes from $1200 to $200 and then stops going down, that means that there's a significant amount of people who think that bitcoin will be worth at least $1200 again at some point in the future.
- The longer bitcoin stays around, the more secure it gets, and the more trust society places in it not to fail.  Ultimately, value is based on trust.  The reason the US dollar is so valuable is because it's been around in one form or another for centuries, and it has a very wide user base.  People hold dollars because they trust that it won't suddenly become worthless, because it has a history of not suddenly losing value and there are hundreds of millions of people who won't divest from the dollar, no matter what.  The same is true of gold.  Interestingly, this causes a positive feedback loop wherein the more people who are long an asset, the higher that asset's value goes, causing more people to buy in, etc.  
The difference between bitcoin and these older assets is that every time there's a bubble, bitcoin gets a huge amount of attention in the media, exposing people to bitcoin who hadn't heard of it before.  A fraction of these new people will inevitably choose to start investing in bitcoin long-term, because they see the promise of the tech and the *potential* for it to become the world's future reserve currency.  The baseline for the market price is now higher.  Rinse and repeat.
There's really only one thing that could stop this process, and it's that a fatal flaw is found in bitcoin's protocol that another cryptocurrency fixes.  This would cause bitcoin to fade away, and the new currency to take its place.  Barring this, I really don't see how bitcoin won't one day be worth trillions of dollars.

@_date: 2015-03-27 05:49:18
I disagree, at least with the first part.  It *is* on the blockchain, because you have to deposit bitcoins into it.  It also pays *out* in bitcoin, if you request a withdrawal.  ChangeTip is effectively a bitcoin bank, which is what makes it "bitcoin-y".
So yes, they could run a fractional reserve.  But if everyone figured this out and tried to get their money out all at once, ChangeTip would collapse.
Imagine a service that is identical to ChangeTip in every way except it uses fiat instead of bitcoin.  The difference between fiat ChangeTip and bitcoin ChangeTip is that fiat ChangeTip isn't global, because people would be required to connect their bank accounts, which isn't feasible for many people with an internet connection that can easily access the bitcoin network to deposit/withdraw.  Bitcoin ChangeTip is much more universal, quick, and seamless compared to fiat ChangeTip.

Many things said about bitcoin are false or oversimplifications. In recent history, fees were not required.  Now they are.  This will not change until the lightning network is (or other layer 2 systems are) widely used.
Bitcoin's usefulness does not come from being "free"; it comes from being decentralized, algorithmically regulated, uncensorable, pseudonymous, and fast.  If you don't think this is worth $.02/txn, again, use some other payment system.


As long as bitcoin is faster and cheaper than Western Union, people will continue to use it. Also, if the price skyrockets, then
- fees will not necessarily go up, because the fee market is based on transaction volume not the price per bitcoin, and 
- everyone holding bitcoin will suddenly have way more money.  It's only the people who *aren't* holding that will be negatively impacted by rising fees.
Also, if the price skyrockets, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.  One of bitcoin's most genius features is that it heavily rewards its early adopters.  As long as we're reaching a new all-time high every few years, more and more people will buy in, meaning more people are invested in its success.  The more people are invested in its success, the faster the ecosystem and technology will improve.

You are correct. The reason fiat money has value is because a large organization with a lot of power (the government) says that you need to pay your taxes in that currency, so everyone must work to obtain at least a little of it. 
The thing that gives it its real value, however, is the assumption that it will be exchangeable for goods and services in the future. Thus, bitcoin has value because of the belief that, in the future, I will be able to exchange bitcoin for goods and services. If a large organization that everyone regularly buys goods and services from (Amazon, eBay, etc) announced that it accepts bitcoin for everything, bitcoin's value would similarly increase. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:15:35

I disagree.  A protocol necessarily espouses the principle that it should exist because it is necessary.

My comment was only half-serious as indicated by the ":p"
However, there are problems with your position. 
The only reason bitcoin is extremely volatile right now is because people are not pricing their goods and services in bitcoin. It's a chicken and egg problem. Higher market cap means more liquidity, which means less volatility, which means more people accepting it, which means higher market cap. 
Also, fiat currencies aren't the safe haven you seem to be suggesting they are. [Russia's own currency]( lost over half its value this past year, though it has recovered a bit now. The wonderful thing about currencies is that there's always a reserve currency; one that's trusted more than any other. In the fiat world, if you don't live in America, sucks to be you. In the post-fiat world, you are free to hold bitcoins, litecoins, dogecoins; whatever you want. If one takes a hit, that just means that another one is doing better. Whole populations aren't screwed over by their central banks' missteps; just people who aren't diversified.

Because they want 2MB-bitcoin, not 8MB-shitcoin. They need a majority of the community to agree to the HF, otherwise what results is not bitcoin.

The solution is not to change bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm to "make" it asic-resistant, but rather to wait until manufacturers of general-purpose processors get into the mining game.

I share your concern, but ultimately, if bitcoin's price keeps going up in the long run, people will be attracted to it by virtue of the fact that it's a great long term store of value. There are many things keeping people away from bitcoin right now.

Well sure, your example of "mine and donate" is one possible use case where complete anonymity is possible. Shipping can be done anonymously as well, if you're careful. 
My point is that bitcoin is inherently anonymous. The only situation where anonymity becomes not guaranteed is when you use systems that are not anonymous (shipping, exchanges, etc) in connection with your bitcoin address. Using these other systems potentially reveals personally identifiable information, but this is not because *bitcoin* isn't anonymous; it's because *exchanges* and *shipping addresses* are potentially not anonymous. You are only as anonymous as your weakest link, but bitcoin itself is always the *strongest* link in the chain. 
Also, it's impossible to design a system that meets your definition of anonymous. There is no such thing as a secure system that is immune to user error.

Yes, bitcoin's price should fluctuate with its actual value; that's how free markets work. However, there should come a time when goods and services are priced in bitcoin, which is a bootstrapping process culminating in a high degree of stability for the currency. It's just volatile right now because people have no reference for how much a bitcoin should be worth, so it's susceptible to insane speculative bubbles.

@_date: 2015-03-05 07:12:38
Your concerns are certainly valid, but I think they're a bit overblown. 
First of all, people are accumulating BTC now because they think it'll be a worth a lot more in a few years. At least, that's why I'm accumulating BTC. In the future, if bitcoin hits moon altitudes, I think you'll see bitcoin holders move parts of their holdings into other investments, like stocks, or even private startups through crowdfunding. In the fiat economy, you have to be an "accredited investor" (rich person) in order to get in on a startup before it goes public. With bitcoin there is no such restriction. So I think instead of stagnation, you'll actually see an explosion of innovation through crowdfunding. 
Why is everyone hung up on the whole income inequality thing? This is a feature, not a bug. Bitcoin *heavily* rewards its early adopters, and this is just how it should be, since it encourages everyone to be an early adopter, which drives up the price. Besides, can Roger Ver do anything evil with his piles of BTC? What would be his incentive for this? What about billionaires in the fiat economy? I think when you compare the two economies, it's clear that income inequality is much more of a problem in the fiat world than the bitcoin world because of how the incentives differ. In the fiat world, when you become rich and successful, your best strategy is to use your clout to influence politicians to grant you favors while hurting your competitors, because if you don't, your competitors will do the same to you. So, in the fiat world, you can use a large pile of money to steal wealth from others, especially those who are less wealthy. 
With bitcoin, conversely, the cost of acquiring bitcoin in a dishonest manner is much higher than the cost of earning coins in an honest way, since I cannot easily compel anyone to hand over their coins to me, even if I'm super rich. Why does Roger Ver's or Satoshi's wealth scare you? The only thing they can do with it is buy something with it, sell it, give it away, or invest it. They can't use it to promote laws that screw over ordinary people, because bitcoin is beyond laws. They also can't use it to get more bitcoins, unless they make profitable investments, and profitable investments are good for the whole economy. 
I think the bitcoin economy will be very different from the fiat economy we live in now, such that many things that are considered harmful now will be totally innocuous in the bitcoin economy.

All I'm saying is that with bitcoin, it's *possible* to remain completely anonymous as long as you don't screw up. And no one can coerce you to do anything if you're anonymous. 


Exactly, no one will ever know who stole the Gox coins because bitcoin has things like mixers. The probability that the original thief still has possession of the tainted coins is vanishingly slim. 


This only gives the government knowledge of who originally traded fiat for a particular transaction output. What happens to the coins after that is impossible to know unless personally identifiable information is leaked. 
All I'm saying is that if bitcoin were to see mass adoption tomorrow, the world would be a much better place because the costs of being dishonest are much higher, and honesty is rewarded more directly. And, ok, it's not *impossible* to steal someone's coins if you're the government, or have lots of money, but it is *much* less likely. 
I understand that a completely secure system is basically impossible; however, the reason cryptography is awesome is not because it's *perfectly* secure, it's because it *drastically increases the cost of an attack*. 
I agree with you that we still have a lot of work to do, and that's why I'm doing what I can to help out unsystem, OpenBazaar, and others. 
I think my original point still stands; that in general, it is not economically to use the threat of violence to steal people's bitcoin. It is much easier to just get your bitcoin through honest means, since bitcoin is also creating all sorts of new ways to earn money on the Internet. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:57:25
True. ChangeTip is also more convenient, though, and it also advertises itself, as well as informing the recipient of the context of the payment. In order to work as well as ChangeTip, and also use the bitcoin network, there would need to be a bot that looks for signed transactions in reddit messages and broadcasts them. There would also need to be an easy way to write these messages in the first place. Or, I write a message replying to you in which I mention the bot and an amount, the bot asks me for my signature, I sign the transaction using... Some kind of browser extension? The bot then broadcasts the transaction on my behalf, while replying to my message. 
It's not impossible, someone just needs to build it.

Perhaps it's because hard forks are much riskier than soft forks as old nodes would be out of consensus and would thus risk being defrauded.

While it's true that hoarding bitcoins drives up their immediate value, spending them increases their long-term value, because a currency that no one ever spends is useless and therefore worthless.

Welcome to If you're wondering how bitcoin is different from government-issued money, there are two main differences: its supply is permanently capped, and there is no need for anyone to trust anyone else for the system to work. Thus, bitcoin is what's known as Byzantine fault tolerant - up to half of its users can attack and attempt to bring it down, but it will continue working just fine. 
If you want to know why bitcoin has value, ask yourself why the money you're used to has value. 
Cheers! $2

It's easy to label something as "malinvestment" in hindsight, but when it's happening now, you don't sit there trying to figure out how to spend your investment as efficiently as possible, or which products and services will be most useful to the community; you just do whatever seems to be the most profitable. When money is tight, that just means fewer things will get tried than when money is easy. It doesn't mean that more things will succeed; it just means that fewer things will be tried. 
Moreover, a lot of people don't seem to realize that there is value in failure, as long as the failure is completely analyzed. The book "Being Wrong" by Kathryn Schulz explains this very well. Humans have succeeded in part because of adventurous individuals who were willing to eat any mushroom -  yes, some of those individuals ended up sick or dead, but the rest of the tribe can now benefit from knowing which things are safe to eat. The same is true of companies. Progress is not driven by succeeding; it is driven by *trying to succeed*.

Yes because, although you're not required to accept CAD as payment, as said, you *are* required to pay CAD to the government in order to avoid jail. This makes it extremely practical to accept as payment. Again, if Amazon started accepting bitcoin, that would make bitcoin more practical to accept as payment.

If the FBI is not lying about how they acquired those coins, they got extremely lucky (and used lots of illegal surveillance techniques to catch Mr. Ulbricht unawares). My point is that, in the fiat money system, the FBI would have simply found the offending bank accounts and confiscated them, and there would have been no recourse for him. In the case of bitcoin, Ross had to *massively screw up* to allow the theft of so many coins. These are still early days. Every time someone is caught like this, or gets their bitcoins stolen, security and privacy will just get that much better. The fact is that with bitcoin, as never before, it actually is possible to remain anonymous, and how do you coerce an anonymous person to do anything? 


Yes, but not through coercion funded by wealth; only through skill and luck. The difference is significant I think.

I was denying the statement that 


I'll try a better explanation. Say I make 10 btc per month, and my rent is 3 btc/month. The act of getting paid converts 10 btc worth of USD into btc. The act of paying rent converts 3 btc into USD (unless my landlord holds, which he does). In the end, a net of at least 7 btc were bought, which produces *upward* pressure on the price. It doesn't matter if I get paid entirely in BTC, or only partially in BTC; as long as the amount I earn is more than the amount I spend, I'm providing upward pressure. 
Edit: "soon after" is a deadline of sorts. The effect is the same if I replace slightly *before* paying rent.

@_date: 2015-02-02 14:58:47


Yes, I'll agree with that. But that's a rather arbitrary line to draw between anonymous and not anonymous. Pseudonymous is equivalent to anonymous in the absence of personally identifiable information. Reddit throwaways are anonymous, aren't they? As long as you use Tor or a VPN service, how can anyone know who you are in meatspace? Bitcoin is just like that. If you use a different address for each transaction, there is only one transaction necessarily tied to the receiving transaction, and that is the spending transaction. As long as you don't reveal to whom you're sending those coins, no one can possibly know what you're using them for or how many you have.

My point is that there is no such thing as perfect privacy, just as there is no such thing as perfect security.  A lock can be the most perfect lock in the world, but if I leave the key lying around, or if I don't utilize it properly, it doesn't matter.  The same is true of privacy - no matter how perfectly private a system is, I can always leak information about myself intentionally, or if I don't know what I'm doing, or if there is a powerful adversary trying to unmask me.  So, Monero and Dash are not magically anonymous if Bitcoin is not.  They may be *easier to use anonymously*, but you can't say that Monero *is* anonymous while claiming that Bitcoin is not.

People are using bitcoin to anonymously buy goods and services right now. That's one major reason bitcoin is fundamentally better than fiat. 


I don't understand how creating a new address for each transaction is fundamentally different from this. In both cases, the recipient of the transaction cannot be tied to any real world identities, as long as the recipient has not revealed any personally identifiable information.

Hmm, interesting perspective on property rights, that it must be on your person. Is this what anarcho-communism is all about? I haven't read into it, but it seems that might be it. 
So, you don't believe that I if you build something that you have the right to own it? 


Yes, this is why I love it! Fiat's incentives are perverse as hell.. You're incentivized not to work, or to stay in a dead-end job forever. You're incentivized to borrow money for everything rather than saving or investing. You're incentized to become a board member or investor of a huge corporation, suck up to the banks and the regulators, deliver crappy products at a high price, and never innovate; simply legislate your challengers into oblivion. 
Bitcoin will change all this by removing the effectiveness of violent coercion in achieving anything. Bitcoin may very well finally help us achieve world peace.

I admit it requires a bit of imagination. 


The miners, which are directly employed by the protocol. Also, one could argue that the shareholders are also employees since many of them are actively working to increase the value of the bitcoin network by spreading awareness and building cool stuff on top of the protocol. In the future, "employee" will no longer be a thing, since it will not be necessary or desirable to have only one employer. Instead, people will simply split their time working on whatever suits them, with a heavy bias towards whatever DACs they hold shares of. 


Capital gains through appreciation of the value of a bitcoin. 


It's written in the code; the bitcoin protocol. It describes 100% how decisions are made. Thus, it needs no board of directors. For now, the devs and/or the Bitcoin Foundation are in practice a sort of meta- board of directors since they can affect the pieces of policy that haven't been decentralized yet (e.g. the Bitcoin Core code, PR, etc.), but their power is limited by the miners, and if they make bad decisions, they will quickly lose everything no to other, competing DACs. In the near future, I think it makes sense to eliminate centralization in these areas as well using distributed governance schemes, which is what the "next generation" of DACs are currently implementing. 


You're forgetting the most important part - the people! The people are what makes it an organization, albeit loosely-defined, voluntary, and fluid. But I think bitcoin holders in general have the goal of sending the price "to the moon!", which many of us are actively pursuing. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 00:21:16


True, I wasn't thinking about this scenario. I still think you have to be pretty damn sure it's gonna work. If anyone records you doing it, or calls the police, or identifies your car, you're in trouble. 


Anonymity is the cure for this. Bitcoin's anonymity is pretty good, and improving all the time.


How? I know of plenty of coins that were stolen, but not one of thieves has ever been caught. Bitcoin is fairly anonymous. 


Armed thugs analyzing the blockchain? I know of almost no one capable of tracing a heavily anonymized chain of transactions more than a couple hops. Anyone with that kind of skill would be much more likely to earn a living simply being a blockchain detective, unless it's millions of dollars' worth. And if it is, hopefully you have a better storage solution than simply keeping it in your house. 


That's why you should stay as anonymous as possible and don't put all your coins in one place. 
Interesting developments, thanks for this.

True; as long as people are willing to sell their bitcoin for fiat, this is a hole in the system. I think it's very probable that in the next generation or so this will no longer be the case as the global fiat monetary system is currently eating itself. Once bitcoin (or some other trustless decentralized currency) gains enough legitimacy for people to trust it as much as fiat, it's game over for fiat. At that point, the only recourse for governments will be to hyperinflate their currencies and immediately dump the newly created money into crypto. Anyone holding fiat will be left with nothing. 
It's possible that other outcomes are possible, but IMO this one seems to be the most likely.

@_date: 2015-02-28 21:47:22
You make some very good points. It is true that bitcoin is more frictionless as a tool for robbers, at least for now. 


I keep most of my bitcoin in cold storage; I don't just walk around with it on me. 
(b) One cannot take half a million dollars in cash out of the bank without the bank getting suspicious, and
True, but your average person doesn't *have* half a million dollars; anyone with large amounts of cryptocurrency should remain as anonymous as possible. 
 (c) one cannot do that in the next 10 minutes or else, and 
As I said, I don't keep half a million dollars on my phone. And hopefully neither does anyone else, for now at least. 
(d) the robbers would have to carry the cash with them; and, on the other hand, 
Not if you used a bank wire. 
(e) if the victim wires the money to another bank account designated by robbers, they will not be able to cash it out for many hours, during which time the victim may cancel the transfer and/or the police may get in the way. 
See [this story]( for a recent example of getting away with stealing a large amount via wire transfer. I agree this would be harder to pull off via violent coercion, rather than hacking, but you could potentially just hold the guy until the transfer clears. 


This only happens in hacking attacks. Can you imagine if a thief went around demanding BTC from people on the street right now? He'd get arrested way before he got any money. 
Yes, I agree, bitcoin is slightly more useful to robbers than fiat. But only for hacking, not for physical threats; and only until digital security becomes good enough that the average person is easily capable of securing their private keys. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:55:58
I agree with you, but your last comment about someone borrowing your money doesn't make much sense, as you could easily use the credit system yourself, rather than your debit card. Credit cards are way easier to use as the bank can simply reverse the transaction if it is believed to be fraudulent. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:25:33


A very interesting perspective.  This is essentially the problem that King Solomon solves in the [Judgement of Solomon]( the solution is to give ownership over the item to whomever cares about the item the most.  But this does require the use of a [violent] third party, in general.  
With bitcoin, an interesting situation is indeed formed when someone's private key is stolen.  Basically the protocol inherently ignores such property rights.  If I you steal my private key, you can spend my funds; the system won't know any different.  I hadn't heard of property rights expressed that way, but I think I agree that a system such as bitcoin's, which ignores property rights (or at least as we know them), is the superior system since it disincentivizes violence completely.  I'm still mad that someone stole my private keys, but I can report my loss to the Internet, allowing analysis of the failure, which will hopefully prevent others from losing their private keys in the same way.  
Thus, bitcoin thieves are rewarded for hacking others' computer systems, and that's the way it should be, because the open nature of information via the Internet allows whatever vulnerability that was exploited to quickly be patched.  And the alternative to this is getting the government involved, which always invites violence.  This is also why I think scammers should be rewarded;  when someone scams someone else, that's a bug in the system, and is quickly reported and patched.  
Take Mt. Gox for instance.  Basically a whole bunch of people were either scammed or hacked out of a large amount of coins.  This prompted the development and adoption of a whole host of tools to help prevent another Gox: proof-of-reserves, multisignature hosted wallets, hardware wallets, etc.  We tried to bring the government in to do something about all the lost coins, but ultimately they were useless.  The only thing that will keep people from getting scammed and robbed in the future is by developing better security tech.  You can't fight technology with violence forever; you can only ultimately defeat it with better technology.  And I think that's the proper way for the incentives to align.
All of this would not be true without bitcoin, however.  Bitcoin allows individuals to act over the Internet in a trustless way without any need for middlemen, but before we had bitcoin, we had to rely on middlemen, who inevitably became powerful.  If property rights are not respected in a society run by middlemen, the middlemen quickly steal everyone's property.  This doesn't help anyone, because there's no recourse when a large organization steals your property, because there's nowhere to hide in the current system.  If a large enough organization wants to, it can take everything you own and throw you in jail forever; there's nothing you can do (see [this](  But now that we have bitcoin, there is an asset you can own that no one can take from you by force.




Bitcoin encourages honest economic activity because no one can take it from you by force, and therefore there is no longer an incentive for anyone to suck up to the government and the banks, because there's no longer to *be* a government or a bank, because the point of forming these centralized institutions is to forcibly rob people of wealth in order to fund and implement whatever agenda is imagined.  These institutions are ostensibly for the purpose of funding and implementing the public welfare, but once the elite control most of the resources, it is no longer economically optimal to listen to the desires or needs of the masses.
The ideal political system is one in which the optimal outcome for the whole society is achieved by letting individuals be as selfish as possible.  This is because solving the problem of your own well-being is a much simpler problem than solving the problem of everyone's well-being.  In such a system, being the best person you can be is as simple as earning as much money as possible, since money is what incentivizes people more than anything else.
Bitcoin enables not only this new, optimal configuration of incentives; it also enables people to be as selfish as possible by enabling all manner of Internet commerce.  Now that we have bitcoin, a person in Sub-Saharan Africa can earn a living by watching ads, or making arts and crafts and distributing them globally, or providing any number of services like those offered on fiverr.com and other freelance websites.  Before bitcoin, working multiple part-time jobs was difficult to pull off because of the difficulty in accepting fiat on the Internet, labor laws and taxes; but since bitcoin became valuable, these obsolete structures can finally fall away, like training wheels.


I don't know if you've noticed, but the government *can't control bitcoin*.  This isn't by accident.  This is because policing it would be prohibitively expensive.  The same can be said of the Internet.  The government may try to control it, but at the end of the day it's much more valuable to the world if left mostly to its own devices, and efforts to clamp down on it ultimately fail.  Likewise, with bitcoin, the government can put regulations in place to try and control bitcoin, but ultimately, such regulations must be in line with the desires of the actual market, otherwise the market will find ways to route around the regulations.  And why would the government want to regulate or destroy bitcoin? That would just be shooting itself in the foot, since bitcoin is so damn useful.  Bitcoin isn't as widely used as the Internet, but once it is, there will be absolutely no incentive to shut it down, since it will enable universal freedom and prosperity.
Anyway, that's how I see the possible future, and I'm going to try and make it happen.

This is how political consensus works, at least for now. There are extreme elements on one side (Jihan/Roger/big blockers/BU HFers) and extreme elements on the opposing side (small blockers/Luke-jr/BIP148 hawks). The job of the "leaders" (core) should be to walk the line between the two. But it's necessary for the extreme elements to exist, otherwise it would be impossible to know what the community wants.

Exactly, which is why it's probably not their real position. Again, they're hoping to convince the majority to HF to 2MB.

Yes, gold has been supplanted by paper and plastic money in everyday transactions.  What I'm saying is that it'd be fine for an interbank settlement system, or for settling trades between nations.

Ah, I was specifically talking about bitcoin malinvestments, but I see what you mean. Bubbles such as those are essentially transparent Ponzi schemes where the goal is to stay in just long enough to profit massively and then get out right before the collapse. 


Sure, that's certainly a problem with our current financial system. 


Yup. Unfortunately, this is the allure of becoming an entrepreneur in the first place.

Bitcoin will be *easier to use anonymously*, sure. But if the bitcoin of the future can be said to be anonymous, so can the current bitcoin, as it's *possible* to use anonymously. There can be no system that is *impossible to use non-anonymously*. So there is no stronger practical definition of anonymity than what bitcoin already has.

Exactly! The difference between fiat money and bitcoin is that fiat money is the property of the government, which means it can watch virtually all large transactions, so it can pretty much know roughly how much any given person has. If you're anonymous (and this is becoming easier every year), they're basically just guessing. So during the transition from fiat to crypto, it'll be a good idea not to buy lots of expensive stuff, and it'll be a good idea to live somewhere where taxes are low or not enforced. 


So he might know that you have 1 BTC on your laptop and threat you for that... but he does not know about the sheet of paper hidden in your shoes that have a private key worth 1000 BTC.


YES! This guy gets it. The point is not that it's *impossible* to commit violence, the point is that bitcoin makes it an *unprofitable* strategy to *depend on violence as a regular practice*. That's what I mean by "it removes the incentive for violence".

Nope, you don't need a mixer or anything. Best practices are simple: don't reveal your identity or any piece of personally identifiable information in connection with your bitcoin address. By default, only the user has access to personally identifiable information. Without revealing your identity, a bitcoin transaction is simply a group of random strings sending money to another group of random strings. 
Edit: your p2p scenario is inaccurate. You never need to reveal your identity to anyone you transact bitcoin with.

Food is different from bitcoin in that it takes time and energy to produce. Creating a wallet is literally as easy as generating a random number. Using this random number for access to a free and open financial system is as easy as downloading an actual wallet app on an Internet-connected device. 
I think you'll agree that, as of 2015, it is not practical for individuals to produce their own food because they wouldn't be able to accomplish much else. But now that we have bitcoin, it *is* practical, in fact extremely simple, for individuals to be their own bank.

You realize that the service they provide (bitcoin vending machine) is a hard problem, right? Shapeshift does something similar, and they're also known for being slow when shit starts blowing up.

Yes, I agree that if you opt to actually pay the ransom, the perpetrator has more security than he would by requesting a bank transfer. However, he has no more security with bitcoin than if he asks for cash at a drop point.

I hope I'm not coming across as rude; it just strikes me that you *do* have a problem with accepting bitcoin as payment, which is that you think bitcoin isn't "money", and you don't know how to spend it, and yet you've bizarrely decided to accept it as payment. You have trust that eventually you'll be able to trade it for *something*, which I suppose is a sign of how far bitcoin has come.

Exactly, bitcoin is a direct threat to *all* governments whose citizens do not agree with how revenue from taxes is spent. Which is basically all governments. Bitcoin will *dramatically* increase the cost of pursuing tax evaders. Once we have enough people not paying taxes, the government will no longer have *any* resources to pursue tax evaders, since those resources come from tax collection. Put another way, trying to catch tax dodgers will no longer be a profitable activity.

This is actually a great question with a lot of different answers depending on exactly what you're asking. For instance, an HD wallet consists of a single seed that can generate a practically infinite number of private keys, corresponding to practically infinite numbers of addresses. Though this isn't the standard definition, the seed can be thought of as the private key since it trivially gives you access to actual private keys.

I was saying that bitcoin has a very unequal distribution of wealth because it rewards its early adopters, and we haven't passed the early adopter phase yet. Once the total value of bitcoin is on par with the values of national currencies, I'm expecting bitcoin's wealth distribution to even out. 


It's kind of weird that you think you know me. You've never met me. You are extremely incorrect about me. Why so hostile? Did I do something to offend you?

A regular contract is a program written in legalese and executed by a court system. 
A smart contract is a program written in code and executed by computers. 
A trustless smart contract is run in a trustless computing environment, such as ethereum, which is much faster, cheaper, and fairer than a court system.

Give it some time. Mass adoption hasn't happened yet, thus we are all still early adopters. The price was a dollar only a few years ago, so people who bought in back then have a much higher share of bitcoin than people who bought in later. So there will continue to be massive wealth disparity until the price levels off for a few years. Rewarding early adopters is of course a feature of bitcoin, without which there wouldn't be much reason to buy in.

Bitcoin doesn't pay taxes and it's the world's first decentralized autonomous corporation. Other similar schemes can be extrapolated from bitcoin's success. The point is that *all* governments would have to ban a DAC in order to drive it underground, since the Internet has no knowledge of jurisdictional boundaries. If even one jurisdiction were to allow the DAC, it would thrive there, which is what's happening right now with bitcoin.

More than two thirds of the federal government's revenue comes from income and payroll taxes.

Not even a little. If you hold bitcoin, you agree to have your holdings slightly diluted over time in order to secure the network and make sure it still functions. I can't see how something everyone agrees to can be viewed as a negative externality.

Power law distributions of wealth only persist in an economy where it's possible to use your wealth to steal other people's wealth. With bitcoin, you can only acquire someone else's wealth by honestly earning it (or, for now, by stealing their private key - hopefully security practices will improve enough in the near future to eliminate this risk as well). But unlike in the fiat system, I cannot use the threat of violence to force someone to give up their bitcoin, and that is why a bitcoin economy will lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth.

The market value of any resource is directly tied to its scarcity.  This is called "the law of supply and demand".  It's probably the most basic economic concept.  The more of something there is, the lower its market value will be.  Look at oil and what happened to its price when oil producers decided to flood the market with tons of cheap oil in the midst of a global drop in demand: 
If Saudi Arabia could print more oil from nothing, this would be stealing wealth from anyone holding oil, because it would devalue the oil being held.  Not sure how you define "stealing", but "transferring wealth to oneself at the expense of someone else, without their consent" seems to be a pretty good definition.  In the same way, printing money from nothing is stealing.
I'm sorry dude, but you're either intentionally trolling, or *very* unintelligent.

Your wallet (and therefore the backup of the wallet) contains only the private keys that enable you to spend from your addresses (and thus the addresses themselves, which are mathematically derived from your keys), *not* the transactions. The transactions are stored in the cloud, on the bitcoin network. So, any new wallet software that you load the backup into will be able to download any transactions involving your addresses, including ones that have happened since you recorded the backup.
If you're using bitcoin core, the reason you can see transactions that happened after you took the backup is because Core generates 100 addresses when the wallet is created. These addresses are then used in subsequent transactions, so the backup is good until you reach your 100th transaction or so. 
Most other wallets are HD, meaning that all addresses are mathematically derived from a single seed, so the backup is good for like 4 billion future transactions.

I didn't personally inspect the code, but the fact that it's securing pretty much all the world's phone-held bitcoins means that those coins are effectively a bounty on the finding of bugs in the source code. If you find an exploitable bug, your best strategy is to use it for a while to steal people's coins, then report the vulnerability so people don't lose faith in bitcoin and ruin the value of your looted coins. If you don't report the vulnerability, eventually enough people will have their bitcoins stolen that someone else will find the vulnerability and patch it. The cool thing about bitcoin is that, if you hack it, you get to keep your coins, and no one knows you did it. The incentives in this system are genius.

I think you're overstating the difficulty of proper security. First of all, I've never heard of anyone having their bitcoin stolen from a phone app. Second, how much money does the average person have? $10,000? Yes, it'd be dumb to keep your life savings on your phone, but the same goes for keeping it all in dollars, where it slowly inflates away, or putting it in stocks or bonds, or in a bank account where the bank can prevent you from spending it at their discretion. I assert that the tradeoff would be worth it for the average person, especially once the price stabilizes. 


You may be right about this.

I dunno, the word "trustless" just always made sense to me as a description of bitcoin. What bitcoin achieves is it takes away the trusted third parties from financial transactions. So it's middleman-less, or "peer-to-peer", which is already another widely used descriptor for bitcoin.

Any asset that has been going up for a sufficiently long time draws attention. Any attention drawn causes the price to go up faster. The faster the price is going up, the more people pay attention. As bitcoin's value is speculative, the higher the price goes, the higher it seems like it could go, adding to the acceleration of the price increase. This is why bitcoin will always experience larger and larger totally insane bubbles. This process cannot stop until bitcoin is widely accepted, or collapses.

Because you need a device to hold the private key while it signs transactions.  If the private keys cannot leave the device, that is infinitely more secure than if they can.  So a hardware wallet is more secure than any other type of wallet, minus a paper wallet, which can't sign transactions.

I'm just saying, as long as bitcoin has the most secure mining network, it will have the most potential as a store of value, regardless of the supported transaction volume.  Smaller transactions don't need to be settled off-chain, they can simply be settled on another blockchain.  This can be done with sidechains or altcoins such as litecoin or dogecoin.  It's possible that this process will simply eliminate the value of bitcoin, but not if it's easy to liquidate your bitcoin into something faster.
I actually think increasing the block size is a good idea because I hold a nontrivial amount of bitcoin and I'd like to see my holdings appreciate, but I'm not permanently tied to one coin over another.
And if Satoshi originally designed bitcoin to replace all payment networks, he designed it wrong. Just sayin'.

By remaining anonymous. I admit that achieving perfect anonymity is extremely difficult under today's Surveillance State, at least for now, but there are those who have succeeded; look at the success of Edward Snowden at dodging the authorities, or at the resilience of online black markets.


Really? Then where are the Gox coins? 


The word is "pseudonymous", meaning that the funds are connected with a pseudonym, or "fake name" (i.e. your bitcoin address) . This is equivalent to anonymous in the absence of personally identifiable information.

@_date: 2015-02-08 23:20:41


It's shit like this line of reasoning that's slowly killing the world. A government should not ban everything it gets no direct incentive from; it should allow everything that isn't directly hurting someone. The government does not exist for its own sake; it exists to serve and protect the people and our rights, one of which is the right to the pursuit of happiness, which is doing whatever the hell I damn well please, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. 
Besides, the government allows organizations that pay no taxes all the time. Ever heard of a "nonprofit organization"? These are tax-exempt organizations that reinvest any profits into their business rather than paying bonuses or dividends, which is exactly what bitcoin does. It reinvests newly created coins into paying the miners for securing the network. 
And who says DACs don't provide jobs? Bitcoin enables people to work for themselves by offering their services over the Internet. I'd say that's certainly creating jobs. This is another fallacy of conventional "wisdom" - that somehow governments and large corporations are responsible for "creating jobs". No! If someone offers me money for doing something I'm skilled at, I have a job. 
Also, I hold bitcoin, which are shares of the bitcoin DAC. If I work to build useful things on top of the bitcoin protocol, I'm increasing the value of my holdings by increasing the usefulness of the bitcoin network. Voila! Profit!

Ok, I agree that bitcoin is more secure than cash at a drop point, but I think the major reason ransomware asks for bitcoin is that it allows for a convenient way to do this to thousands of people.  That would be prohibitively inconvenient with cash.  If you're just asking one guy for 5000 BTC, cash would do just fine.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:14:01
Yes, exactly. This article is a sneaky way of saying that everyone should adopt bitcoin except governments, to whom it is a threat. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:32:36
Right, but the pirate bay is centralized; that's why governments can shut it down.  A DAC (such as bitcoin) cannot be shut down, even if all governments in the world ban it.  Bitcoin's predecessors failed because they were centralized.  If you're centralized and the US government doesn't like you, you *will* get shut down (unless you're WikiLeaks which, I have to be honest, I'm not sure how is still around).
The reason bitcoin hasn't been banned everywhere is that it would be useless to ban it.  The same goes for DACs.

Again, this is a very specific, arbitrary line you are drawing between anonymous and not anonymous, which I disagree with. Also, what do you mean by "wallet details"? HD wallets with one-time-use addresses reveal nothing except the address the funds are spent to.


Again, no "wallet level information" is revealed if you use HD wallets. 


Now we're getting somewhere. It's significant that coins that were obtained from a publicly known address are always linked to that address. But this does not limit my anonymity in any way, as no one needs to know how many times those coins were transacted between the publicly known address and my own address. I can prove that I control an address, but no one else can prove that I do. 


Really? Have you ever heard of anyone being denied a transaction because they were using tainted coins? 


Yes, because *Coinbase* isn't anonymous. Also, have you ever heard of anyone getting their Coinbase account closed because they received money from a gambling service? If so, how many hops were there between the publicly known address and the Coinbase account? I would guess it's 0 since any other number would cast into doubt the assumption that it was the Coinbase user who was indeed gambling. 


You can do this with bitcoin too, as I explained above. You don't know how many different people owned a given bitcoin before they give it to you. Yes, you can see how many *addresses* owned those coins, but as long as those addresses aren't tied to real world identities, you're safe.  Mixers make this even more guaranteed, since you get "clean" coins out of a mixer.

I see no problem with hype. Did the dotcom crash kill the Internet? No, because the Internet is antifragile. Did a lot of people go bankrupt? Absolutely. Is the world any worse off? Absolutely not. 
Unfortunately, speculative manias are bitcoin's fuel. The reason why bitcoin is exciting is precisely because of how volatile it is. Yes, you can potentially lose your whole investment, but if you play your cards right, the potential upside is astronomical. Failure is necessary in order for society to learn what not to do, and no one would ever start a risky venture without a slight overabundance of naive optimism. Bring on the bitcoin startups. I'd rather see 1000 failures and 100 successes than a few successes and no failures. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 22:49:46
If people can't understand why bitcoin is a good investment, then their loss. I agree: bitcoin is not great for making purchases in face-to-face settings. It completely was not designed for that, so it completely doesn't matter. There are layer two solutions coming that will make those sorts of things better. Right now, Coinbase/Bitpay is the best thing we have, and in my experience, they're not terrible. Bootstrapping a new monetary system was never going to be easy or fast. 
But again, no one's stopping you from contributing if you can. This is the fundamental advantage of bitcoin over government money: anyone can contribute to its improvement. Complaining is not contributing.

A well-written article, Mr. Moy. Indeed, the reason bitcoin is one of the biggest ideas in history is that it is cheaper, faster, and more secure than all previous payment systems.

@_date: 2016-07-03 20:31:48
Andreas makes a pretty good case that mining will become re-decentralized soon because we've hit the Moore's law wall, so it'll be much easier for the average user to get their hands on an ASIC because the hardware will be competitive for a year or two rather than a month like it is now.

The private key allows anyone to spend your coins, untraceably. So, don't let anyone see your private key, and don't lose it. If you let someone else see it, your coins will be stolen. If you lose it, your coins are lost forever. So, secure backups are your friend.
If you use a hardware wallet, the private key never leaves the device except when you write it down when it's first set up, so it's much more secure than keeping your keys on an internet-connected device, which can be hacked. It's also more secure than keeping your coins on an exchange, as the exchange can steal or otherwise prevent you from spending your coins, and there's not much you can do.

Yes, I certainly agree with you here, and I would add that you can't blame people for acting in their own rational best interest. 


Yes, but as an entrepreneur with tons of cheap money, I'd put some of that money towards enjoying myself if I can :). Efficiency with funds is not the most fun strategy. 


Right. I'm just saying, I don't really see a problem with bubbles. Bitcoin feeds on speculative manias.

I disagree; it *is* a defect of fiat that it disappears slowly over time.  Thus, it's logical to have more motivation to save bitcoin than fiat.  This isn't just a lack of discipline; it's a lack of incentives.

Horribly titled post. First, lose the "BREAKING" - it's obnoxious. Second, you didn't actually link to the article. Third, the news is that Italian bitcoin exchanges will not be subject to AML requirements, not that "bitcoin is legal". What are you, the mainstream media?

I hope everyone had a fun and safe night.

Hahaha I definitely fell for those things. It's not being an idiot so much as naive. You do learn eventually.

What the....???!

This strategy involves buying $10 worth of bitcoin monthly. Those people would still be at least breaking even right now, because of how long the price was in the $200-$300 range.

Not sure why. I love tipping!

The private key allows anyone to spend your coins, untraceably. So, don't let anyone see your private key, and don't lose it. If you let someone else see it, your coins will be stolen. If you lose it, your coins are lost forever. So, secure backups are your friend.
If you use a hardware wallet, the private key never leaves the device except when you write it down when it's first set up, so it's much more secure than keeping your keys on an internet-connected device, which can be hacked. It's also more secure than keeping your coins on an exchange, as the exchange can steal or otherwise prevent you from spending your coins, and there's not much you can do.

That's because dollars just disappear over time, so there's no point in saving them.  Bitcoins don't do that :)
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:34:48
Not really.  Once bitcoin is sufficiently leaky, it will become PayPal.  At that point another cryptocurrency (or simply a fork) with better fungibility guarantees will take its place.

Right, but how do you prove you're a full node? Someone recently posted a "full node" that's basically just an SPV node acting like a full node, and appears no different. In light of this, how do you prove you're running an honest, full node?

Sure. Your definition of anonymous is different from mine. 


No, but this discussion is about whether or not bitcoin is anonymous, not whether or not it's easy to use anonymously. People who *need* anonymity should be able to figure it out. 


Sure, but literally the only difference between bitcoin and other, "more anonymous" coins is that the transaction spending the coins cannot be traced to the transaction in which the coins were received. All the problems you described earlier with exchanges and shipping are still present with these coins. 
My point in all this is that a system is anonymous if it can *potentially* be used anonymously. Any other definition of anonymous is meaningless; there's no such thing as a system that can *only* be used anonymously because all it takes to compromise your anonymity is to announce your real identity. So while I agree that bitcoin could be made *more* anonymous, what I'm saying is that it already fits the only definition of anonymous that makes sense.

Interesting point.  Have an upvote.

Some stuff has gotten pushed back, but development is still fairly active. Help out if you're impatient! 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:39:05


Thank you, it's the only one that makes sense, as I explained above. Your definition of an anonymous system is one that can *only* be used anonymously, which cannot possibly exist, and therefore makes no sense. 


I'm not saying I know more about bitcoin than anyone.. we both agree on all the details of how bitcoin works. Rather, the thing we disagree on is the English language, which neither Satoshi nor the core devs know more about than I do. 


Not sure where this came from. I've already admitted that bitcoin could be made *more* anonymous, and I'm sure someday either bitcoin or some other coin will achieve this. That doesn't mean that bitcoin isn't currently anonymous.

If you don't think your ideas are good, then by all means, don't explain them to anyone.

Obviously the first guy to post on Reddit is the honest one ;)

Agreed. Competition will always exist in a healthy market.
@_date: 2016-07-02 01:32:02
If you have a large position in relation to the liquidity on your exchange, you can abuse that position. I think this is what many people are calling "manipulation". 
Also, I see no reason to blindly trust the numbers reported by exchanges, as this is another potential source for manipulation.

That is technically an address, not a pubkey ;)

oh, I get it.  haha.

You mean "defuse" :)

I'm a little concerned that it took so much digging for me to discover the details of this story.  FUD or not, it's big news.
