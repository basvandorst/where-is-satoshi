How are they profiting from it?  Collecting interest?
@_date: 2012-12-04 22:04:27
$13.50!  Hot damn!

This kind of comment has been at the top of every single pirate-related post.  Karma selection doing its thing.
Anyway, has anyone noticed the value of bitcoin has been extremely stable these last couple of days?  Even despite the pirate drama?  It's no fun (arbitrage used to be easy and profitable with the daily price swings), but I guess it's good for the future of bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2012-08-15 18:39:38
This is a dumb question, but wouldn't the memory of the last bubble, make future bubbles less likely?

I've got the rest of my funds spread between a 401K and roth IRA and emergency fund so this isn't like my life savings or anything.  Not gonna do the 10K in one pop either.

If I hypothetically made a deposit now how long would it take to see some BTC return?
@_date: 2012-08-17 19:42:17
Down to 12.80.
@_date: 2012-08-17 19:51:50
People are dumb.  More BTC for me.
@_date: 2012-07-20 16:39:07
I have this fantasy about retiring early. ;)
With my luck though, I'll buy 10k worth of coins and the feds will shut it down the next day.

I agree with everything you said, I guess by huge selloff I meant, it's not going to dip below like $5 ever again, if I had to bet on it.  Mtgox getting hacked was a security breach but I wouldn't say it was a profound one since the problem was with Mtgox not bitcoin itself, IIRC.

That's great to  hear!  I remember getting into Bitcoin after the bubble burst and wondering, "why the fuck did people abandon this?"  (I'm familiar with the reasons, they just seemed inadequate.  In fact one of those "Death of Bitcoin" articles got me stoked about it.)  
Glad to hear it's rising again based on its merits.
@_date: 2012-08-10 14:19:17
what's fud
@_date: 2012-08-16 17:44:51
I'm dumb, what do the colors mean?
@_date: 2012-08-12 13:54:29
how'd the others turn out?
@_date: 2012-08-27 19:19:50
I don't know why this obvious shit is the top comment/focus of discussion, and not the (apparent) fact they've identified pirate.
@_date: 2012-09-08 15:09:53
I'd probably do it if I knew how.  That's a lot of money.
@_date: 2012-11-06 14:20:45
That's really freaking cool - thanks!
@_date: 2012-08-31 18:04:22
Thanks!  This is some crazy stuff.
@_date: 2012-11-05 15:23:10
Then sit on your coins and someday cash in for a fuckton of money. :)
@_date: 2012-08-25 18:36:34
Some claim his dumping a lot at one time would cause a panic selloff, and he would take advantage of that and buy at the lower price.  Some people think that after doing that he would reimburse his investors which is frankly a pipe dream.  
@_date: 2012-08-12 15:37:47
How much have you got back so far?
@_date: 2012-08-19 12:51:03
If you just waited until December when the bitcoin production rate gets halved, don't you think you'd make more money?
@_date: 2012-11-05 15:20:33
Hey, could the digits in a bitcoin possibly be written down on a roll of paper and stuck in a little coin-shaped container, like a roll of film?
Hard drives can get destroyed by EMPs, little bits of paper can't.  I'd like to see a coin-sized bitcoin, with all the data in it.  
@_date: 2012-08-27 19:38:58
@_date: 2012-08-02 18:25:32
I'm getting the picture I should just buy now.
@_date: 2012-08-25 17:28:29
Probably true.  But if you scammed people out of equivalent of $5 million, wouldn't you be tempted to cash out sooner rather than later?  The transactions show one of the biggest bitcoin holders made a massive sell on Sunday, it could have been him.
@_date: 2012-07-18 18:19:54
That looks like Texas.
@_date: 2012-08-16 19:49:48
This sentiment is why I don't think there's going to be a huge selloff again, absent a profound security breach.  People who own bitcoin understand the potential and are generally hoarding.  
@_date: 2012-08-27 13:29:47
Growth projections, legal implications
@_date: 2012-08-27 19:28:11
I did.  
@_date: 2012-10-04 19:45:21
I hope this temporarily tanks the price of bitcoin so some of my orders get filled before December.
@_date: 2012-07-13 17:44:22
Some day that baby will realize she ate 2 years worth of college tuition right there.

If this is your blog, please get a new font.
@_date: 2012-09-06 15:11:23
This is retarded - there's no evidence they even have the documents they claim to have.  And even if they did have the documents, what would stop them from releasing the docs even if they were paid?
@_date: 2012-10-23 13:22:08
Can someone explain what this is?
