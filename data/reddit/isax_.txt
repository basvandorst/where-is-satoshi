Statement on the Release of “BCC/CNY” Trading Pair
Recently at “The Future of Bitcoin Conference 2017”, big block supporters presented a BitcoinABC solution ( bitcoinabc.org ) . We have since received many inquiries from miners and users, asking if we would be supporting BitcoinABC mining, especially from those with ViaBTC S9 cloud mining contracts, who are eager to support BitcoinABC with their mining hashrates.
1.We will designate the token**“Bitcoin Cash”（BCC）**to the possible split coin led by the activation of UAHF.
2.From 22nd July 2017 (UTC Time), ViaBTC exchange users can trade your “BTC” assets against 1:1 ratio into both “BCC” and “BTC_FROZEN2” assets. **Namely, you can trade 1 “BTC” into 1 “BCC” token and 1 “BTC_FROZEN2” token, or vice versa.** Deposit and withdrawal are not available for “BCC” and ”BTC_FROZEN2”.
3.On the same day, “BCC/CNY” trading pair will be released. BTC_FROZEN2 represents frozen BTC assets and is not available for trading.
4.After UAHF activates at 12:20 1st August 2017 (UTC time), **all your “BTC_FROZEN2” asset will be redeemed back to your “BTC” asset** and we will decide on the best timing to allow deposit and withdrawal for “BCC”.
