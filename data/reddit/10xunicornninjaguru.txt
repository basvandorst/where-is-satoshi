GDAX does smoothing after the fact. Really bugs me. I've seen them do that to the trading range too, then when you look at it it's mostly gone. I think they do some voodoo so that the chart fits the window proportionally. I'm not in front of my workstation right now, but I'll check via the almighty API tomorrow to confirm one way or another.

The extent on which is being used is by the oppulent few who are protecting their assets from government seizure and hedge versus inflation, not for your average college graduate professional making $200/mo or less who can't afford 3 meals per day for their families.
Which goes back to my point that portraying BTC as a savior asset of the majority of people in either of those countries morally and intellectually dishonest.

This isn't even taking into consideration that by law of large numbers, going from $5k to $15k it's exponentially easier than going from $15k to $45k even though they both amount to same 3X ROI. So all this to say it's time ppl start listening to long time hodlrs with a grain of salt.

1. volume ... about 3X as much, by my eyeball estimate
2. that one finished _very_ narrow but at the top of the range
So in trading, and technical analysis, volume is everything. It can confirm or deny patterns. Volume is the lifeblood of stock/coin/whatever. With no volume price fluctuations can be exaggerated, manipulated, etc. With high volume it's "the voice" of the market.
Finishing at the top of the range, unlike that one I circled out, does give some hints that bulls "won" that bout even if it's red. So the price outlook was clearer in that instance.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:32:20
Exactly claiming high grounds of long term investment  only works if you're SO deep in the green that  50% correction means nothing to you. Everyone who jumped in at $15k+ is probably sweating now.

I don't know if you're failing to see the bigger picture here. Violent price movements based on 1 financial event is a tell tale sign of overpriced instruments. Be it Asia news or one website. The fact is, when you look at it objectively all arguments _for_ btc, in particular, are proving to be weak or outright false. And when you have such an intrinsically worthless asset at such elevated prices held by specious reasoning, any little nudge throws it off balance and tumbles like brick. It's all related to the price.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:44:03
That's because, unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your views), bitcoin isn't a currency -- even if it was intended as such.
For Bitcoin or any crypto to become a currency it obligatorily necessitates:
1. First and foremost price stability (if price moves more than 2-3% on the daily, it would make an awful currency) not likely to be addressed any time soon -- maybe never?
2. Ease of movement cheap and fast transactions  (this is what LN and others are trying to address).
So, even if we were to FF clocks a year and LN fully adopted BTC would still not be a candidate to be a currency.
For the moment, though, we have to come to terms that the best use case for BTC is a volatile financial vehicle -- which any trader and risky investors can appreciate. But we can't try to "sell" BTC as a currency as it might never be one.

With that formation (long legs, narrow body candle) no one knows. If you are in the sidelines, stay so, if you're already 'hodl'ing sit tight. But it's clear it's not a good time to jump in now. Have to wait until a price direction has been set or until the dust settles.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:21:33
Probably some random whale. You can't really predict that :/
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:17:10
It means bulls (buyers) and bears (sellers) are very aggressive; to the extreme, I would say. They spent most of the hour fluctuating in a $500 range going back and forth. Ending in a relatively narrow candle, which when combined with long legs and high volume _usually_ means there's a high degree of conflict in price expectations. In layman's terms it means for the moment, stay the **** out if you have not entered the market. If you have it means hold till price direction can be deduced.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:08:49
Maybe, just maybe the market is coming to terms with the fact that in spite of all its merits, BTC and all cryptos are grossly overpriced and is correcting itself. It's not doom, but it will hurt a lot once it's set and done.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:50:25
Thanks. This myth of BTC being the savior of the needy needs to stop. The vast majority of people in troubled/impoverished countries simply and factually *cannot* afford to buy BTC. 
In Venezuela people, in a very literal sense, cannot afford food, let alone a crypto which as we've seen in the last 3 months can be extremely volatile and lose value rapidly. In the case of Zimbabwe is even worse as they grapple with famine, tribal wars and other socio-economic issues. More fundamentally, though, pretending BTC is a reliable, dependable store-of-value instrument poor folks should invest on is morally and intellectually dishonest.

While I disagree about your grim prediction of $3k, I do agree that that money is gone and semi-likely never see that price again. If it capitulates, I think it'll spike down to $5k-ish then float around there for a long time. Maybe next half-ning will bring the next hype cycle.

Your right. The dip from 19200 to ~12000 has nothing to do with it being over valued. So overvalued, in fact, that one day it fell ~$1000 because *one* website stopped taking Korean exchanges into account.

Sorry but that's outright nonsense. Just because *you* use it as such doesn't mean it is. That's decided by the market and the market is decidedly saying it's not, for the reasons I cite above.

I have checked with their API, as suspected the graph does smoothing (which they shouldn't as it's deceptive) to fit things proportionally on the chart.
    Volume (Avg): 184.520
    Volume (Lowest): 51.22
    Volume (Highest): 397.076  is the 1-hour candle in question
    Highest Volume is ~ 2.15X bigger than the average
    Highest Volume is ~ 7.75X bigger than Lowest Volume
API Price and Volume data collected using the following parameters:
    cl.get_product_historic_rates(product_id='BTC-USD', granularity=3600, start='2018-01-07T03:00:00Z', end='2018-01-08T03:00:00Z')

There is no sale wall, not yet anyway. Until people can short it w/o having to resort to shady exchanges, those barriers are purely psychological. All crypto markets are super inefficient precisely because there aren't "motivated sellers".

Similar story here (except different crypto): father lives in a shithole south american country, he's close to 70yo now, work is hard to come by for the young, let alone someone close to 70. Thanks to a mutual friend I found out he was living almost in misery and he needed any help I could give. My father is intensely proud, so he'd never ask for anyone's help. However, he happens to be the provider of (his) "out of wedlock" kid; my half-brother. The kid, afaik, is deep in the autism spectrum (for instance, every time I speak with him he talks like a cartoon robot -- he hasn't grown out of that phase for at least 10 years). Anywhoo, because of surge on cryptos I was able to cash some in and send him $1000 (to be fair I would have sent him the money regardless) which I believe it's worth about 4 months worth of a clerical salary there as "Christmas gift" to my half brother -- so that he would accept it. He's still in a very precarious economic situation and no reason to think things will get better for him any time soon, but at least this will for sure give him much needed breathing room. 
So, tulips bubble or not, they certainly are making a difference in people's lives.

You have obviously never swam with the sharks. They will make money short, long or sideways. It's us the little holders who get usually butt reamed. They short 10k btc and can cover within 2-3 ticks if the trade goes south, then go long for a few more ticks, and play every trick in the book. The fact that you think individual investors have any chance against institutional traders is what sounds cocky af.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:20
Same argument can be made about BTC (or any crypto, for that matter). The price of BTC is none that simply we collectively thinking that's its fair value. There's zero inherent value to any of them.

It's a huge problem and a few years ago I gave some $ to some such scammer here on reddit and by the time reddit detectives had called them on their BS, that money was who knows where. Which makes those people doubly evil and hope IRL karma comes and bites them in the ass, because not only they're taking the money from someone who might actually need it, they tamp the generosity of others who become reluctant to give after getting burned. Fuck those people.

This is greed talking and the easiest way to get market slaughtered. Truth be told only those who were already well off or forgot about them then found a thumb drive with a `wallet.dat` in 2017 are the so called hodlrs. Anyone in their sane mind would have cashed when in peaked at 1200 in 2014 and absolutely no regrets, specially if you went in at &lt; $1. Or people who cashed them out of necessity. Exact same stuff when I hear "if you had bought 1000 shares of Amazon post IPO..." Yeah you would have probably sold it by now for a number of reasons. TL;DR; so long as you cashed at positive ROI, you shouldn't regret it if the thing goes postal sometime later. Because for every BTC there are dozens of financial vehicles that fizzle after a bull run.

Over 100k txn w/o confirmation since last night. Txn fees up to the roof. Put another way, if you're holding btc in cold storage you're going to keep holding whether you like it or not. And if you want to buy anything with btc right now, better camp out cause it's going to be a while.

Both. They will drive price whatever direction they feel is most likely to make them money. These are people who trade literally tens of millions of dollars every day, have done so for decades, have armies of quants at their disposal, ridiculously optimized trading bots. These are the people who will pay $100 mill to get fiber to the exchanges and have a 2ms response time improvement.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:36:09
Very well said. As of today I could have ~$240K but instead I cashed out most of my 22 BTC in 2016 at $264 per IIRC. I needed the money then and quite honestly other than fanboys no one thought BTC was ever going to be worth what's worth today. You can't beat yourself up. OP still has ridiculous ROI in spite of his supposed bad decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:54:20
First: I don't know why btc has shot up the way it has -- there's honestly zero reason to it. I believe the concept of Blockchain and crypto currencies are here to stay, disrupt and grow, but the price rocketing it's just nuts.
Second: txn have never been free or cheap. Txn confirmations are a function of the network hash/mining. The more difficult it becomes to mine (a function of price, network hash, etc), the slower the confirmations are. The slower the confirmations are the more txns need to pay if they want to be in front of the line. Right now the btc blockchain is very ironically the worst case scenario of dysfunction and the reason why B2X, BCH forks happened.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:44
On the contrary! Shorting makes things more efficient. As of right now things go up and up even though there's no reason for that  increase and people make money. There's zero sell-side pressure now with the exception profit-takers so sometimes you see spreads that are $200-300, sometimes more. When you have motivated sellers (i.e. shorts) that gap gets super tight because that's in essence free money for them. And when you start seeing the bids go down in response to price drop instead of meandering around, price goes down immediately to bid, again lack of motivated sellers is a huge part why BTC has gone up nearly 50% in a week. w/o shorts shares of amazon, Apple and Google would be $50k each by now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:39:45
2k8 was greed. Not a failure of their processes and models. In fact, a bit of a travesty to how systematic these folks generally operate at.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:49
Best way really is to set up stops at a profit level you are comfortable with. Say you got in at 10k, set your stop at $15k. That's a 50% profit in about 3-ish weeks. If you don't think that ROI absolutely mind-blowing nuts, you shouldn't be buying btc, tbh.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:52:27
All I can say it's many folks have jumped on btc recently with money they can't afford to lose. I know with btc skyrocketing I sound like an idiot, but whatever amount you have right that you can't make do without, it's not different than dropping it in a craps table with a really hot shooter. Sure, it seems you can't lose and you're making money, till they roll a 7 out and you're in the red. 
I'm honestly a bit scared how people are throwing money at it w/o any concerns. 
You made good money? Great. Don't get cocky and set your stop exits.

You can absolutely cash out at a loss if you think the price will go lower. I bought a small fraction at 14.5k, set my stop at 13.5k. Now I'm just waiting for it to form a solid base and jump back in whenever that happens at a much lower price point and bigger stake for same price.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:35:51
How's that silly? My BTC stopped out at 13.5k at a 10% loss. I'd be deep in the red otherwise. Rule number 1 of capital preservation is to set stops and let the market take you out.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:25:15
Not unique to this thread by any means, but I see a lot of folks falling in the sunk-cost fallacy. Just because you're down X% and "I mean you already have invested Y dollars in it, might as well keep putting money on it. Too late to cash out now." etc. 
I don't care if you can afford to lose it. You're still losing money and putting more money at stake. Think of it this way, let's assume you initially bought some at $17K, as of right now the price would have to _double_ just to get your money back. 
And unlike in 2014, right now you have a LOT of factors against a dramatic rise than there were a couple of years back; none the least is now huge institutional money can (and are having a ball with) short BTC. As a side note: when they first announced futures the whole community went nuts and I noted something along the lines of "the community just doesn't understand this is really bad news."
TL;DR: stop buying in the way down. It has never worked well. Let the dust settle and let the market buy you back in if and when there's a resurgence. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:08:27

I disagree completely and have more than enough evidence to back it up. Stop orders keep you honest (takes away emotional holding) and keeps you disciplined. You set your entry point and your exit point. I was willing to be 10% wrong so I set my stop there. I'm $4500 richer because of it. And $4500 of extra purchasing power I have when I want to jump back in.
