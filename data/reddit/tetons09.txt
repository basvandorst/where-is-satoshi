I think the idea that you can lose all your bitcoin is a big hurdle for average Joe adoption.  The majority of people will need to know there money is insured is some way.
(Also I get that banks don’t actually have all your money waiting for you on a safe and that I have significant investment in bitcoin)

I’d be tempted to cash out for all that USD, but also would be temped not to sell anything assuming all my other bills could be paid. 
I can never decide if btc is way for me to get more USD or a what’s going to replace all FIAT currency.

Bought the dip....
Hoping this is the bottom.

Everyone shits on Coinbase, but I get nervous about being personally responsible for a hard wallet.  I guess there would be companies that would insure your bitcoin?

Let’s assume big money (hedge funds) finally start buying up bitcoin.  The new standard is to have 1-2% of their money in crypto.

If it’s at 20k, yes

I’d be jacked about 30k at this point.

I wish reddit had a way of aggregating the number of times someone has claimed “last chance to buy at x dollars”.   
People really going for the even a broken clock is right twice a day strategy.

“Just is case of what?”   
Ahhh...fires, flooding, crime, sudden death by health or accident, shady cops, shitty friends or relatives.
I mean I’m hanging out on this subreddit because I own and believe in bitcoin, I just haven’t seen this issue discussed much (especially in terms of larger adoption).  People on this subreddit and who own bitcoin are generally more comfortable with computers than 95% of the general population.

Cool insult, bro. I own bitcoin and own my keys, but to act like this isn’t going to be an adoption issue is naive.  
Go tell a generation of 60 year old men and women that have used banks their entire life and may not be proficient in computers they are sheeple for not wanting a 3rd party to protect their money.

I’m about 20% - thought we’d be at 15k by now though
