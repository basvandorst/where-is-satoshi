This isn't a conspiracy theory because they do it with their own currency. If they didn't manipulate their own currency they wouldn't be pulling in so many manufacturing jobs. It is in their interest to keep the value of the of the yuan volatile. Although they don't do it on the same scale as can be done with BTC it is being done. Look at the USD/CNY historical charts and you can see the pattern. It is part of how they get people to invest in businesses there. You want to start a business, so you pay for everything when its a good exchange rate (more bang for the buck) and then just wait for the periodic reversal and repatriate the profits, unless you are based in the US and then you don't always repatriate because of being taxed again.

It is a science fiction/political series that is based on the idea that some guy figured out how to compute the future and he never told anyone how he did it or what he found out BUT he did set up vaults that opened after 1,000 and 10,000 years that had some message from him. I read it a long time ago so I don't remember the exact details but obviously the guy was dead when the messages were delivered thus they had to be prerecorded.

Dubai is a city, not a country. The country as a whole is trying to make a change. They are pushing education hard and if you look up Masdar City there is an attempt to help contribute to the betterment of society. What you forget is that the UAE is less than 45 years old as a country. The fact that they can provide anything to the world other than oil is a huge success.
As for taking care of the poor, its common practice here to do small things to help the poor. Teachers leave left over food (still edible and healthy) for the cleaners at the schools so they can take it home. At the end of each trimester the teachers pooled together money to give as a gift to the guards at the school. One of the maintenance guys at our apartment building had a death in his family but couldn't afford to go back so the the guy in the penthouse (Emirati) paid for it. It may not be a perfect place but you make it sound a lot worse than it is. I live in Abu Dhabi and have several friends who live in Dubai so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about. Yes the image of wealth is a big part of the lifestyle here but it isn't the most important thing. Most of the workers in our building are happy to be here because it means they have a job and can send money home to their family. The guys I work with have been working to pay for the flights to get their family from the Philippines here. They may not be making what they could make in the US but they are making more than they could in their home towns.

This is so true. I'm a casual bitcoin guy, I haven't paid cash money for it but I don't mind a few extra bucks on my electric bill to mine altcoins to change into BTC with the hardware I already have. 
I'm a holder, I won't really lose anything if this all goes south BUT if it does go south I'll probably never put more money/electricity towards a crypto again. If BU does take the lead, forks, and drives BTC down I fear this will eliminate any chance of the general populace taking crypto seriously. Why? Because someone literally made their own copy of the most successful crypto and drowned them both. The average Joe doesn't even like putting his money in the widely accepted investments and people can't copy and paste those. 
Since July of 2012 I've been in and out of BTC ownership but never have I actually been nervous about it until now. Selling off BTC has always been prompted by external needs.

Finally unlocked and was able to sell at 6.6% instead of 17% when the transaction hit 20 confirmations.
Had I not borked the transaction originally I would have had it on another exchange that was lower volume but higher price. Would have likely ended up at 22%. Between when I borked the transaction and realised the problem and fixed it (1 whole day) that exchange had dropped significantly. So it is partly my fault, sucks a bit but it was free money so I shouldn't complain.

Run computer mining for a while when I wasn't paying electricity and had didn't really understand what bitcoin was. I just knew it was free for me and it could make me a few bucks. Eventually stopped mining for some reason and forgot about bitcoin. At some point the computer needed redone due to bloat and I wiped the drive.
If I remember correctly I had a $60-80 worth of bitcoin at the time and it was more work than it was worth to get it exchanged so I didn't bother. Today it would be worth far more than that but once again, I would have sold it long before it was worth more than $200-300 per coin.

Startup cost depends on how big you want to go and if this is an additional idea when building a new rig or upgrading. Could be anywhere from an extra hundred bucks if you are upgrading already and spring for a better GPU or thousands of dollars if you go balls to the walls.
ROI, depends on if you are measuring your expenditure in BTC or USD(or other fiat.) In all likelihood, you will see a better ROI through simply buying BTC, but if BTC crashes you have only the BTC. If you have a mining rig you at least have used hardware you can sell or will be making more BTC than it used to, hopefully, if you keep it.
ROI depends on your cost to production ratio.
I started with simply buying a better GPU 5 years ago, since then it paid off the difference and cost of electricity. I used the the little bit of profit to buy a second GPU, eventually it paid itself off. I'm barely ahead of just purchasing the BTC in the first place and I have been around for all of the massive payoff periods. I count any purchases as having to recoup the BTC spent since I have not invested any fiat in this again since the initial purchase. The recent price increase (from $1,500) has made this very hard to do but I have an overall value greater (at today's rates and estimated resale prices of my hardware) than what I started with + anticipated earnings of the smaller farm.
Is your wife going to be the one mining? If not why do you need her permission? If it is you who will be mining you just need to prove its value to yourself. Do research, there is tons of information out there already, just keep an eye on the post date as much of specifics change quickly but the core ideas are the same. 
Its impossible to say if your ROI will be positive or negative much less how much.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:51:41
TL;DR at the bottom.
I'm going to ignore software and OS limitations to demonstrate the costs. In reality the below setup is NOT possible for most people if at all. In reality it would be best to run more rigs with fewer GPUs (IMO, 6 due to power supply abilities.)
Lets work this backwards, Watts to BTU is 1= 3.41ish so you need to be running 14,650 watts of power to make the desired 50,000 BTUs. 
Lets say you are running a Vega 56 and burning 130 watts as reported, lets add 20 watts to count for any error and the motherboard and ram and PSU costs. You would need around 100 Vega 56's to get that kind of heat. (well there are lots of other cards that mine around that point but these are the cool new card at the moment)
Now for the cost, at 100 cards you could probably get a deal from XFX since you are buying bulk, lets assume 15% off retail. When in stock you could have had them for around $400, looks like nearest available is Gigabyte at around 450 on newegg but you can only get 2. Lets assume our retail price will be 450 and discounted price will be $385 shipped.
We also need motherboards, ram, drives, and PSUs. Lets assume the motherboards will not die on us so we can push maximum PCIe slots without the risk of massive loss of productivity due to losing a lot of cards at once. The Asus B250 Mining Expert allows for 19 GPUs but lets throttle down to 17 because cable management is a bitch and we need 6 anyways.
For PSUs we will go with the CORSAIR HXi Series HX1200i because its a platinum level PSU and efficiency is what we want. These will support 6 GPUs+any peripherals (RAM, CPU, drives) at 80% load rating which is likely its most efficient point
SSDs for fast boot, low power usage, small size, Sandisk it is because China knockoffs aren't worth saving $15 each on this project.
RAM, lets go 8GB per mobo but in all reality, it may need more I have no clue on something this size.
CPUs - these are going to need more than just your bottom of the barrel option.
Alright, so we have CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and PSUs. You will still need risers PCIe Risers, make sure you get the ones with the desired power connector (I prefer molex which I believe is usually Ver6.) Going to order extras because there are always some DOA.
* 120 PCI-e USB Riser x $5 = $600
* 6 Intel Core i5-7400 x $190 = $1,140
* 12 CORSAIR ValueSelect 8GB x $85 = $1,020
* 6 Sandisk 120GB SSD x $65 = $390
* 17 PSUs x $250 = $4,250
* 6 Asus B250 ME x $230 = $1,380
* 100 Vega 56 x $385 = $38,500 
Total : $47,280 ^1,2
^1 This does not include networking, cases or racks (homemade or purchased), electrical modifications to support such a massive load, or your time setting this all up.
^2 Electrical cost would depend on your area but we will assume $0.1 per kilowatt hour. Since the power supplies are at least 90% efficient we will be consuming approximately 16,300 watts or 16.3Kw. Daily this amounts to about $40 in electricity costs. 
Each card would earn you about $2.16 at current prices for Ethereum or $4.10 at Monero current prices. If things stayed like this, they never do, it would take 130 days to break even. Difficulty goes up constantly which means earnings go down and as such it will take much longer than that to break even. On something this large you need to calculate depreciation of your equipment when thinking about ROI because you could sell off hardware if you wanted to.
It would cost about $50,000 and a comparable gas heater would cost you around $3,000.

They key is he isn't mining bitcoin, he has two GPU rigs that are leasing their hashing power to other people who use it to mine altcoins. Since bitcoin is the generally accepted standard for payments that is what NiceHash has chosen to use as their payment medium. 
Other people pay bitcoin to rent hashing power, NiceHash is the market to place orders, you supply the market with your hashing power. Sellers set their rigs up to hash certain algorithms or profit switch and are paid the average contract price being facilitated. This means every seller on a specific algorithm gets paid the same rate per Mh/s even if the contracts being facilitated have a larger range.
In general this is nearly as profitable as mining stable (sic) coins but buyers use it for coins that they thing will see increased value and need/want additional hashing power asap without a large investment. 
The biggest benefit for sellers is that they no longer have to deal with which coin is most profitable and exchanging it for their preferred coin. This is more relevant to smaller farms as they may not meet minimum payouts on certain pools or deposit thresholds on exchanges with specific coins as a single miner.

This is the biggest reason. Sure the red tape and ever watching eye of the government will be an issue but the heat that is already there added to the amount of heat generated would demand massive amount of infrastructure. The power needed to run the mine is one thing but the power to run the chilling systems is crazy.
Most high power usage facilities (stadiums, race tracks, convention centres) use generators to bolster what the infrastructure can provide while under high load. This works find if you only have to run them for a hand full of days out of the year with known income. Long term operation would require a much more expensive system because the utility isn't likely to build what you want where you want it.
Development of your facility is also going to be massively expensive. Property is artificially expensive due to the restrictions on where the city is allowed to grow. Although there is a lot of "cheap" labor the companies that build what you are asking for know that there isn't anyone else for you to go to. This means the price of construction is high for the quality you get compared to elsewhere in the world.
I have a 2 bedroom that costs about $40,000 per year in rent. It's not a new building, it doesn't have a nice view, parking sucks, I'm 15-20 minutes from most places I want to visit for dinner or shopping, and the build quality is shit. The dishwasher, oven, and laundry washer are hardwired in even though they only sell units with plugs because the junction box isn't the right size to put an outlet in. The wiring colors are inconsistent. The drains for the balcony are at the high spots and occasionally the place gets a funky smell and they don't know why. You get the idea, and I'm considered lucky to only have these issues.

It depends on why you are buying it. If you have massive cash it could be worth it. Rents here are very high, my company pays more for my housing than my annual tuition costs for private university in the US. 
What that means is, if you pay AED 650,000 of a studio apartment and can charge AED 65,000-70,000 a year for rent you stand a chance of breaking even in 15 years. 
That's not a terrible risk considering how the region has fared over the recent economic hit. Prices haven't dropped very much and demand seems to be picking up again. If you bought in 2008-2009 you've already made back your full investment costs

Edit: I don't know if you have seen how much marketing these companies do and how much it costs them. This is probably super cheap for them.

I have experience is dealing with an increase in support demand that outgrew what we could handle just as poloniex has, although in an unrelated field. 
You have two options 1) just throw more people on the team and train them as best you can in a live environment or 2) pick you team carefully and train them well. 
The first results in substandard support, increased ticket volume, repeat tickets, and unhappy customers. 
The second takes more time but yields better results.
Poloniex have already explained the situation they are in and how they are trying to adapt to the increased support load. Their trollbox mod team has been reassigned to support and they are adding as best they can. Given the nature of their business I'm sure there are also regulatory considerations on who they can onboard. 
If you are in the US think about the last time you called your cellular provider and the level of service they provide. They average 6 weeks of training for a mundane job. Think about what poloniex need in terms of support ability.

My suggestion is as I have always suggested, do not invest more than you can afford to lose. 
My company is currently growing quickly and we anticipated some growth but not as much as we have seen. We are able to keep our existing customers happy by not over booking ourselves. Training lead time for my company is 3 months before I can send them out by themselves. That's serious lag but it's manageable because I can turn people down for he moment if I explain why. 
Can you imagine an exchange saying "sorry no more new registrations because our support team might not be able to support an equally large increase in tickets."  No way, everyone would laugh at them and move on to the one that was accepting everyone and then bitch about the lack is support.

Your confused on how the American justice system works. They can seize (arrest) you and your assets upon probable cause in public. This doesn't have to be justified to anyone beforehand. If a warrant is issued the probable cause has been presented to a judge and he has deemed there be a need for deeper investigation and grants the authority to seize anything that may turn out to be evidence. 
Not one bit of that process proclaims that you are guilty. The case must still go to court to be tried. If the prosecution cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed by the defendant, they rule that you are still innocent. It is up to the prosecutors to prove the defendant guilty. 
Additionally, they don't have to offer the evidence to the public at the time of seizure.

The 24/7 support may be applicable to your provider however several do not offer such. 
Several financial institutions don't offer 24/7 support for accounts. Credit cards and transaction providers are probably the only areas you can get 24/7 support for any need. 
Sure, many have automated systems to handle most requests but it is doubtful that you could contact them for a loan at 3am. 
Poloniex is the size of a small regional bank which happens to have no storefront. The lack of access and small size is a reason most people stay away from such banks. Small banks and credit unions thrive on being good providers for a particular geographic region without the machine feel of a large company. 
Don't like poloniex? Don't use it. There are plenty of other exchanges and it's your choice.

Now that I think of it I remember something similar happening in the past (oversided fee) and the mining pool offered to return it.
If I was the pool operator not fuckin way I'd turn that back but then again I don't know the ins and outs of running a successful pool.

We've already hit 45c temps here so this isn't much of a surprise. Got in the car yesterday and and the thermostat showed almost 60c inside.

When was the last time you cared about a penny? How much longer will it take before BTC hits $1m? Why would we care about a penny then?
At this point I just round things to the nearest half dollar so at that point we would need to hit BTC = 100m before its a potential issue for businesses. So many things are already purchased in $XXX.XX per 1,000 or 10,000 pieces, why would that change?

If there were any funds/coins in Mt Gox that belonged to Americans it was a crime that had victims in the US and as such the US can claim jurisdiction.

Simply hiring people is not the solution. Look at call centers and how "helpful" they usually are. Is that the type of person you want solving your money problems?
You must be selective in your hiring then you must train them to be effective. This process takes time, lots of it when your dealing with finances.

How do you not learn from the first experience?! Or the second one?! If you make the same mistake 3 times you probably should be out of the game.
