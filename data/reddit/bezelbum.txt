Mine nearly stopped talking to me when I mentioned it was coming up to 19K and complained at how "cheaply" I'd exchanged some of my stash previously.

I'm not sure most people would look at it that way. Which is important when you consider what Juror's might think.
When you're being charged with laundering, it's much more likely it's going to be perceived as you taking a cut. Certainly the prosecution will probably try to portray it as that, in the hopes of convincing the jury you knew exactly what you were doing. They'd obviously also just say that a claim it was a 'gift' is semantics, and that it was a payment in return for doing something

The problem is, money laundering is a federal offence, and weed is still illegal under federal law. So, the feds can very much do him for it. Whether that's morally right or wrong is obviously something else, but it's the current position all the same.
If he privately bought a  car with BTC, as you say, no-one would care. However, if he then sold that car to someone knowing he was receiving "ill-gotten" money (and, as in this case, appears to have kept a $5K cut) then he'd likely be in a similar position to now.
There seems to be additional information coming out, bit by bit, and the more I hear the more I'm starting to lean towards him knowing he was up to something sketchy, and trying to portray it as an attack on BTC to garner support and sympathy. 
If they were targeting BTC, there are far easier ways for them to do that. My concern is, that he's probably going to do a good job of tarnishing bitcoin's reputation on the way down.

They claim he took money which was 'dirty' (in the sense that it was gained from selling something illegal under federal law) in exchange for something clean and of worth (the BTC). Otherwise known as laundering
Worse than that, he seems to have fucked himself further. From his tweets, they wanted $15,000 worth but he insisted it had to be less than $10,000 (to avoid the MBR limits).
They sent him $14,500 anyway, so he sent $9500 of BTC and kept the rest. They're sure as hell going to try and portray that as him knowing he was laundering and keeping a 'cut' of the payment.
