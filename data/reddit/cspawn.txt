No way!  Awesome!  Thank you, haha!  I never thought I'd see that again.

University of Arizona doesn't seem to work :(

Oh, cool!  I'll look into it.  I don't have a computer that's never touch the internet, but I have one that's not connected currently.  Wipe it and use that maybe?

*high five* i just hit my first  0.1 - Dedicating $20 a pay check adds up!

Ok, that is what I thought.  I now know about paper wallets and whatnot, and I still am learning before I spend any real money on them.  I assumed it was gox flipping them around however they wanted.

It did!  Making a wallet tonight and stashing away my first satoshi's. Thanks again!  Haha!

Id keep adding to it.  It just seems like it'd be a wise investment?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:49:27
Its the money I'd be OK without.  I own 2 cars, both paid off.

Hmmm, I haven't drank that much of the kool-aid, yet.

And thats my main hang up.  Do I hold out until it drops?  Surely it will drop to under $200 again at some point, right?

That's what I'm terrified of.  I remember sitting in my room on something awful reading about $7 coins, having the mtgox site up and thinking "eh, not right now". I regret that so much.
