Didn't they once say the ideal search engine would provide one answer for every query?

No, sorry. One answer per query. Not one answer for all :)

I think I posted my reply on the main thread. Here it is since I took the time to type it out for you.
1) This is certainly not a "recent battle cry". One major selling point from very early in was Bitcoin is a way to store wealth that is not controlled or moderated by central banks and is fundamentally disconnected from fiat. Would I store all my money in BTC right now? No. Do I think storing some in BTC makes sense? Hell yes. 
It is also strange to me the you talk about gains on BTC as being very short term. The strict limit on quantity says otherwise. Looks at it's growth in the past year, despite its early stage accessibility. 
2) Bitcoin provides BASIC banking services to less developed nations they otherwise could not access. Anyone with a smartphone can store and transfer funds without permission from banks. This accessibility and functionality will only improve over time. 
3) Sure, I won't be buying a coffee with BTC anytime soon, and I have little desire to. However, when purchasing $500 and up items, BTC is still attractive. Anyone who has needed to transfer funds to make purchases knows what a pain in the ass it can be. 
The only real argument from volatility going around that makes sense to me atm is that I shouldn't spend because of the loss in gains. I say that depends on your personal financial situation. I spend money all of the time that would be better served in long term investments. Most of us do. That's fundamental. Spend now for instant gratification over long term gains. 
I expect BTC will be less volatile in a few years, but until then, we will all spend some money. It comes down to ease of use for any given transaction. I expect a period where folks will be cashing some BTC into other coins like LTC for spending purposes, rather then converting back to fiat. But that's a trend pointing in BTC direction, not against it.

For the larger transfer fees for export by to your wallet; If you are using an exchange like Coinbase, just hold your funds there temporarily till you hit a large enough number to feel comfortable with the fees. With the smaller purchasing fees, I wouldn't buy less then 20 usd worth at a time if you are paying 2 usd or so per purchase

Don't assume when BTC hits 21 or even as it rises up to it, that distribution of BTC will be in any way evenly distributed. You will have some BTC billionaires, some BTC millionaires, and a lot of late adopters. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:08
That's essentially what I was implying. Sorry if that was unclear. Couples fight over money, it's a very common issue in terms of control. 
I 100% agree that if there is any realistic stress about possibility that they lose their $1,000 then they should not invest in Crypto. I have a lot of confidence in Bitcoin, but I don't kid myself into thinking I could never lose whatever money I store there.

Thanks Gary Johnson.

It is still up for debate imo whether you can say LTC is developed with better utility. Ultimately my confidence in BTC comes from my confidence it it's dev community and the community at large. I see our "slow" pace of changes for scaling as a good thing in terms of security and optimization.

Fortune Telling.

I like how folks 4 years ago were "waiting for the next crash" so they could "get some kind of decent return" 
Awesome. Hehe
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:04:18
Let's not pretend The Big Dipper can't happen. 
Let's also not pretend we aren't waiting for it to happen just so that we can more easily build up our own personal bitcoin real estate.

In 2014, according to the CIA's World Factbook, the GWP totalled approximately US$107.5 trillion in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and around US$78.28 trillion in nominal terms. 
But BTC is not just a currency, it is also a commodity. All gold in the world is worth about 7.5 Trillion USD. I would argue BTC as a commodity, a technology, as an international store of wealth and money transfer is far more valuable than gold as a commodity. 
Would trillions of value in Crypto change the world as we know it? Yes. And many crypto enthusiasts have been aware of this from the beginning. It was the whole point. 
But will it destroy fiat? I seriously doubt that. At least not short term (next 50-100 years)

How did the last halvening effect price? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:44:18
If it comes up, remember the price you would have gotten if you didn't need to argue about it for months ;)
All joking aside, I'm sure you both knew dips would happen, and worse could happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:31:52
It's legal. And strange. 
"Of the 100 billion created, 20 billion XRP were retained by the creators, who were also the founders of Ripple Labs. The creators gave the remaining 80% of the total to Ripple Labs, with the XRP intended "to incentivize market maker activity to increase XRP liquidity and strengthen the overall health of XRP markets."
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:08
Interesting. I wonder how much of that was due to the reduction in coin distribution vs other factors like the overall acceleration of demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:39:05
Fantastic post. Thank you. It will be fun to see whether they can crash anytime soon. I have to think the insane pace growth in interest and overall volume has to make crashing more difficult. 
The fact all of the futures news is yet another example of BTC news positive, negative, neutral, thus only seeming to encourage public interest. 
Home prices have been relatively stagnant. The stock market is strong, but people are wary of the next crash, interest rates are still unbelievably low. Far too few people have been saving/investing due to lack of interest. 
Now BTC is becoming a household name, and is a VERY easy way for just about anyone to save money without having to jump through hoops at a bank. I only see popularity and interest rising this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:39:15
Well said. My top reason for backing BTC is that it isn't afraid to take the time to get the technology right. 
Rushed code is shit code. Personally I have never bought what I can't afford to lose. These dips don't bother me. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:37:39
This is awesome. Bitcoin Community. Fuck yeah. And this is just the very beginning. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:05:47
Short answer, no. 
Edit: If gold tripled in price would that make USD useless? 
Not saying The meteoric rise of BTC won't have any impact on fiat, but I don't see it having a larger impact than other big commodities. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:51:16
Given the relative value of a Satoshi I don't see it becoming a huge problem. 
Combine that with the fact most HODLers at this point know what they have, and have a way for family to access the money should an untimely death occur. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:19:16
That assumes the average crypto user will prefer the coin with the lowest fee. 
It's just as likely (if not more) that under a certain point users will weigh other factors outside of fees.  Even factors that seem irrational or illogical. 
My guess is ultimately ease of use, and security will win out as being highest in demand in terms of features. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:54
That may or may not be true. You can have 6 or 7 figures to lose and still argue with the wife over spending a couple hundred dollars. :) it's possible they see it in the correct light. Pure speculation and essentially a luxury purchase. (Not that there is anything wrong with that!) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:03:25
I'm sure this will be just as exciting as last time.... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:11:47
When you factor in that they gave the rest of all the coins to their own company, iirc they still own upwards of 60% of the coins to this day. 
That means when you buy Ripple you are for the most part buying them from the founders and their company who can parse the coins out at a pace that puts supply below demand increasing the price and maximizing what they can sell for. 
What happens in a one sided market like that when those buyers decide they want to sell, filling in that gap in demand? I think it's safe to assume the founders and company will not be buying. They can simply sit, wait for the buyers to eat the loss, and then slowly start selling again when/if speculative demand starts up again. 
Sure, other coins have whales who can manipulate the markets, but one massive primary coin holder/seller is a very different situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:17:58
This is perfect. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:51
Bticoin's security, community, and infrastructure are easily worth its brand and reputation. Bear in mind we are talking about brand and reputation of a protocol. There is no Bitcoin marketing team, no Bitcoin Corporation. 
Bitcoin is a store of wealth, it's a bank, its a currency, it's a commodity, it's a game changing technology. The brand and reputation in this case are just positive consequences. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:18
I have been watching BTC for a few years now. At this point, dips just look like a fresh opportunity to buy. BTC is nothing if not resistant. 
Do yourself a favor and forget about chasing short term gains through speculation. 
If you aren't willing to HODL your position for a bare minimum of two years, BTC investment is not for you. 
Still want to HODL? Give up worrying about short term gains and losses in USD. If you want to HODL, focus on building up your BTC real estate. Forget about what your have in USD. Think about what you have in Satoshi. 
Price in USD will rise and fall, regularly, but you don't lose a single Satoshi until you sell. 
Finally, never forget, don't ever invest what you can't afford to lose. You can not invest intelligently if you are also invested emotionally. You will never remove emotions from the equation if you invest what you can't afford to lose.

XRP is NOT a stock or company share.  The comparison makes no sense. They also publicly state they have no intention of holding, instead they will sell up to a billion XRP a month if demand allows for it.

CHEERS EVERYONE!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:24:39
I considered buying XRP but the fact the founders retained something like 20% of all the coins, and the whole "pre mined" thing made me concerned. There are iirc 100 billion XRP which are divisible by 1 million. 
For a long term HODL, I don't like Ripple, but I could be very wrong. I haven't researched it as much as I could.
