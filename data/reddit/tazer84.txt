The answer to your question is no you would not pay taxes multiple times on the same money.
Here's an example.
**Transaction A:** You mine 25 bitcoins on some random day. The market price for that bitcoin at the time of mining is $100/coin. The cost basis for your 25 bitcoins is $100/coin. You report $2500 as self-employment income and pay tax on it. Your overall (cost-basis) situation looks like this:
    1. 25 BTC @ $100/coin
**Transaction B:** You buy 10 bitcoins (from USD) some time later. The market price was $200 USD, but your buy price was $150/coin, so the cost basis for those 10 coins is $150/coin. You had already paid tax on the USD from before, so you pay not additional taxes. Your cost-basis situation is now:
    1. 25 BTC @ $100/coin
    2. 10 BTC @ $150/coin
**Transaction C:** You trade 3 BTC for 30 ethereum and pay an additional 0.2 BTC fee. The market price for BTC/USD at the time was $500/coin. You treat this as if you sold 3.2 BTC to USD, paid 0.2 BTC worth of that USD to the broker, and used the rest to buy ETH.
* Using a FIFO accounting approach, those 3.2 bitcoins came from **Transaction A** so you realized a gain of $400/coin for the 3.2 coins. You pay the appropriate gain tax (short or long-term) on the $1280.
* The total cost of the 3 bitcoins that were traded for ETH was $1600 USD, which forms the cost-basis for the ETH.
    1. 21.8 BTC @ $100/coin
    2. 10 BTC @ $150/coin
    3. 30 Ethereum @ $53.33
**Transaction D:** A few weeks later you trade 30 ethereum back to 3 BTC. The exchange deducts 0.2 BTC as a fee. The price of BTC at the time of trade was $700/BTC.
* Using the 3 BTC and the USD price, we can see the ethereum was sold at a value of $2100 USD. The cost-basis of that ether was $1600, so you pay tax on $500.
* You use the $700/BTC price as the cost-basis for the 2.8 BTC you have left. The 0.2 BTC fee is ignored because that didn't come out of the selling portion like in **Transaction C**, it came out of the buying portion.
    1. 21.8 BTC @ $100/coin
    2. 10 BTC @ $150/coin
    3. 2.8 BTC @ $700/coin
**Transaction E:** You transfer 30 BTC to another wallet you own. You pay a transaction fee of 0.2 BTC. You pay no taxes on the amount transferred (since you still own it), but you do consider the transaction fee. Treat it similar to a brokerage fee, so as if you sold that 0.2 BTC to USD and then used the USD to pay the miner. 
 
* You use FIFO, so that 0.2 BTC comes from your earliest purchase. At the time of the transfer, BTC was back down to $500, so you realized a gain of $400 on the 0.2BTC. You pay taxes on $80.
    1. 21.6 BTC @ $100/coin
    2. 10 BTC @ $150/coin
    3. 2.8 BTC @ $750/coin
**Transaction F:** You sell 30 BTC for USD. The strike price is $2000/coin. Again you use FIFO, deducting the 30 coins from your earliest purchases.
* You realize a gain of $1900 on 21.6 coins. You pay tax on $41,040.
* You realize a gain of $1850 on 8.4 coins. You pay tax on $15,540.
    1. 1.6 BTC @ $150/coin
    2. 2.9 BTC @ $750/coin
    3. $56,580 USD (in coinbase account)
**Transaction G:** You move the $56,500 to a bank and pay coinbase an $80 fee to do so. You pay no taxes on any of it.
So at the end of the day, you only pay tax on the money you make. Some things to note:
1. **I'm not a tax accountant** The above scheme is what I use.
2. All the examples above are gains. Losses are just negative gains in that the math is exactly the same.
3. Don't calculate tax on every gain/loss. Add up all the less-than-one-year gains/losses and calculate income tax on that. Then add up all the more-than-one-year ones and pay capital gains on that. If either short-term or long-term is a net loss, claim it is a deduction.
4. I'm debating if considering transaction fees in gain/loss calculations might be overkill, right now I err on the side of caution.
5. Some people are saying that trading one coin for another different coin is a "like-kind" exchange, which allows for tax-deferment. From what I've read, such an assumption would be risky.
6. Some people are saying you can use LIFO instead of FIFO. That also seems risky to me.
Hope all that helps!
