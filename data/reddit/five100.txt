I agree with a lot of his points (the guest). 
But just saying the word hoard makes me cringe. 
If no one held, Bitcoins would really be worthless. The more coins that are held, the more valuable the others coins become. Which makes it more valuable to mine. Which makes the network more secure. 
ITS NOT HOARDING ITS HELPING!!!

Bitcoin is a beautiful invention that I think has a real POSSIBILITY to become wildly successful and help the world at the same time. 
If you wanted to buy 10,000 rubber chickens as an investment, I would not agree that's a smart move. But I wouldn't post after every one of your positive posts that you are stupid either. 
I've been investing for about 10 years. This is the first time in my life, that when what I'm holding goes down I get excited. 
What I'm getting to is... I really enjoy the quite comments here. You even prefaced your comment with a self deprecating  "I know this is over optimistic"... And people are still making negative comments...
Don't listen... I'm not... I'm buying... As much as I can as fast as I can.

1/2 of the reason Bitcoins price will rise IMO, is the decline of the dollar itself.
So when you are a millionaire, milk will be $15... So the banks ALREADY won that round.
The other half of your profit will come from buying an asset early that later more people want for more money. SO....
Somewhere, right now a dude is at work making $15/hr. He is saving every ounce he can, because he knows if he puts in 40 years of working hard and adds to his 401K plan. In 40 year’s time, he will have acquired $1,000,000....
Then, in 40 years he is going to cash that $1,000,000 out (Year 2055). BUT, it's almost worth nothing!
So he says....
"I am going to take my life’s earnings and buy... 1 Bitcoin. So someone else will not dilute my lifes work any more"
Then you at that same moment sell one Bitcoin.
IMO... Average Joe losses because of flaws of fiat AND you are willing to forgo security for profit potential.

This comment is currently 54 minutes old. It's one of the best I have read in a while. 
1) Already someone has responded "Please, oracle, tell me more about the future"
is not saying "Aw man, small caps are going to have a big quater, flip that stuff and make a quick 12-14%"
He is saying (I think) "The goverment printed a ton of money (QE)..... It's now going into the stock market, so we KNOW it's going to continue to go up until this massive bubble breaks"
IF that's what he is saying, I can not aggree more.
When "it" happens, it's going to be fast. When Antopolus is on the Today show explaining How Bitcoin Works to a drunk Hoda... You going to be very very mad that you did'nt stay in at least 25%.
I did'nt plan on posting, but this is getting down votted!? And then he gets called out like he was trying to show of his prediction prowess... come on.

"Who aren't that bright"
If you feel you have the ability / right to call someone bright or not bright... The Joe Rogan podcast probably won't be for you...
I (can not speak for others) love the podcast because everything / everyone gets a chance, and then is debated on a fair level IMO.
How many people would love Bitcoin... If they just gave it 10 minutes time....
But instead, many people brush it off as "Sketchy" and say it "Sounds Fishy"
If I was on Joes podcast and said I think the Sun is made out of cheese... I can see Joe saying "No, many scientists have done many experiments. We are 99.99% sure it's not made of cheese"
That's OBV a wild example... But who's to say what's wild and what's generaly excepted... Let's debate... Everything, reasonably.
I'm a type B personality that lives in the city of Detroit and who loves Bitcoin...
My world is FULL of people assuming shit about things I love. 
"Detroit sucks"
Ever been here before?
"Bitcoin is sketchy" 
"IDK Seems sketchy" 
"Once I make good money I'll be happy"
Why will MORE money make you happy
"Come on man, money helps everything"
I understand... But after you have a good car, good wife and a warm bed... How will more money help?
"Dude come on!?"
I'm so fucking sick of lame duck conversations where no one moves from a point of view... 
All the time, Joe will say something like "Huh, well... Uh... Shit... Maybe that's the right way to XYZ and I was wrong"
Joes podcast where everyone and everything thing gets a fair shake IMO.

IMO it's a wash...
Most of the time, no electricity is being "wasted" after being produced... The grid is balanced by many different varying type generators like hydro or wind that can be controlled down to the .1 of a megawatt to balance it out...
Also, turbines in many small locations would be simple cycle (not using the waste heat in the summer)... 
Where as in a power plant, we strap a boiler on the ass end of those turbines to produce steam that in turn makes more electricity and adds an incredible amount of efficiency.

Everything is relative. If "it" is a fortune to you...
Then take 5% of your fortune ($1-$50,000,000) and use the service.

With all do respect I disagree...
This forum has many collectors / investors...
When I talk to (real physical) gold collectors / investors they always have some wild goal.
- College Kid: To own 1 oz by next year
- Coworker   : To own a pound by age 65
So for this collector to hit a personal goal and post about it (I'm going to try to meet you half way here) is not super cool... But it IS an accomplishment. 
What if he is a pizza delivery guy... And that number represent night shifts and snowy car rides....

Why I really love the possibility of these two coming together...
See... The year was 2003...
Some people started to play cards online. Well you never will guess what most people would say when they found out you gambled online...
-"What!? Playing cards on the interweb!? Can't some upload a card virus and steal all of your money!!??"
-"F that shit... I tried it once... I lost... Rigged!!!"
Then... We hit that "critical mass".... And everyone kinda accepted the fact that it was pretty safe... Then... EVERYBODY (Males that like to gamble ages 16-44) was playing... EVERYBODY wanted to get money online (which was a pain)
When I look at the type of people that are into Bitcoin, I see the same type of minds as I did when poker was in 2003. Smart, forward thinking, kinda weird people. 
I hope Poker Stars can give me one more "huge tipping point" moment...

Only if you have disposable income that you are willing to lose if bitcoin goes to zero.
It's recommended to just buy a little bit on the same day every week/bi-week/month/year what ever. 
Buy a little, if you can lose it IMHO.

This is a very common problem. 
Owner likes Bitcoin and loves the once a month business from you guys. 
The clerks and waitresses and baristas have no idea how to use and are not trained. 
The owner of that restaurant has the RIGHT to not train his employees how to use it. Then once a month take the $700 from you guys and cheer for Bitcoin. 
We have the right to take them of coin map and warn others that if you take your wife here and at the END of the dinner try to pay with Bitcoin and it's all you have.... You will be arrested for trying to leave and not pay your bill or have to figure something out. 
I guess I'm sick of people pushing owners into Bitcoin, pushing there business back onto these Bitcoin apps, then me trying to push the waitress into asking the boss on how to use it....
Can't we just let review sites be reviews site and let the customers take care of this one?

Yes, the printing press was a huge step in the transmission of information. Much like that of the Internet today. 
Yet even if people can read about the warnings of history, it doesn't make them any more likely to care. Thus not reading or caring about it. Which leads to "History repeating itself"

I love Detroit... (Born and raised) 
I love Bitcoin...
IMO... Anyone looking to start a Bitcoin business should give Detroit a shot. Here's my case. 
1) Internet works here too... Http looks just the same as where you live (although we don't have google fiber or anything like that)
2) We have tons of space!!! My ex girlfriend runs a major commercial building downtown...
They have young start ups come in all the time. They (start ups) can rent a FLOOR for a very reasonable price...
3) No egos....
Guess what people DON'T do in a city that's 8 Billion in debt and has 7 police officers... Act cocky.
4) Lots of down to earth girls...
I'll break this one down like this... 
When I go to a club in SF, I see 30 good looking girls. Also, 70 good looking guys. 
When I go to a club in Detroit I see 15 average girls. Also 15 normal guys... You have a chance here...
You want head from a 10 in a Lamborghini... Go to SF. 
You want to find a wife and have fun along the way. Come to Detroit :)
In the end...Detroit is super cheap right now, with lots of tech start ups moving in... Get in on the NEXT San Fransisco...
Oh! And one more thing... Water... Lots and lots of fresh water.

I believe people already have made "hour" tokens. 
Which is worth one hour of consultation from that person. 
I see no reasons why you could not issue a "1/2 off X" token. 
But "reward" tokens seem to be where it's at. 
Give some out for each purchase. Take them as store credit. Give more to people who come earlier. IMO
People with your gift card / coupon would also be able to trade with one another.
