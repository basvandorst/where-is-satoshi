 I did the math. Doesn't this mean that the depositors will have to take a serious haircut?
I am not sure complaining about "doing the right thing" will help much.

Decentralised exchanges have many disadvantages. The main (huge) benefit is that when governments start to heavily regulate bitcoin (2017 I think) then they will almost the only way to trade bitcoin privately. Even Localbitcoins will be put under pressure. Possibly somebody will put a centralised exchange behind a Tor hidden service, but we still have a central point of failure.
I think many derivatives can be implemented in a decentralised and trustless way, e. g. the american call option and lending of securities with a security deposit.

They could bankrupt it and restart it under a new name. Seems like the best way to do it, businesswise.

Bitsquare also allows bitcoin-altcoin trading, which is extra interesting now given the stellar rise of ether. Since there is no registration, trading can be done with quite some privacy.

I recommend bitsquare also. No freezing, no money on the exchange, open source, p2p.

If something goes wrong there is an arbitrator. If you sell btc and never get fiat or altcoin then you should not confirm receipt of payment and after the trade period is over you can open a dispute.

Fiat are directly paid to your bank account, or OKPay, PerfectMoney, AliPay or Swish account, by the other trader.

The fact that many exchanges stopped eth, dao trading today is enough for me to trade on Bitsquare. I decide when to trade, nobody else.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:58:42
Bitsquare does not ban anyone, and never stops. ETH as well as other altcoins are traded there, not only BTC and fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:12:12
You can make several parallell trades if the limits are too low.

I don't understand why so many people still use centralised exchanges, given the risk of scams and then these withdrawal problems. There are alternatives such as LocalBitcoins, Bitsquare and Mycelium Trader. A bit slower, much safer.

The BTC turnover increases by about a factor of two every third/fourth month which causes the price increase. The laws of supply and demand do not work well for currencies since the elasticity is zero. No need to invoke the easy buzzword of speculation.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:04:39
Yes. Download the client from Bitsquare.io and start trading. No signup and there is liquidity in USD. No logging and no money on the exchange.

I do not think M0 is misleading. Anything can be monetized, derivatives, debt, shares and pork bellies. However anything which is not M0 suffers the risk of "default" since there is not enough M0 to cover it all.
Given the size of the worlds GNP and the smallest unit people tend to trade in I think Satoshi could have used a few more digits. BTC is also being slowly depleted due to lost coins and some extra digits could have helped there also.

It's a free BTC-world. Incompetent investors will loose their BTCs and then be weeded out of the market, like in the stock market. This will help the market and as such the Pirate is doing a good thing fast. I feel in no way sorry for those who got scammed, in fact it amuses me. There has been no lack of information.
I think the Pirate delays the final storm so that he can cash out quietly without being stopped by MtGox and other exchanges. It puzzles me how he will remain anonymous though. It is difficult to launder such a large amount of BTC. "Somebody" has started to deplete 1DkyBEKt5S2GDtv7aQw6rQepAvnsRyHoYM
with 100 000 BTC over the weekend which may be related to Pirate.

Quadrocopters will start a small revolution in smuggling and may be hired or bought for BTC. I think the borders of the world will start to crumble a bit more soon. I think I will move to a gated community without guns internally in case 3D-printed guns become prevalent. Guns yield too much power to mentally unstable or drunk people. Please argue me wrong.

As soon as somebody gains more by defaulting than by continuing one should distrust that person, WoT or not. WoT only records in a rough way how much a person will loose by defaulting and the pirate was way over that limit. Since he cannot gain more by paying out and start a new trust he will not. 
One should also bear in mind that he has done nothing illegal and in my view not even immoral. He had a high-yielding "business" that collapsed. Nothing odd with that, witness Kodak and Data General. As any good poker player will say: everyone is entitled to lose their money in any way they find suitable.

You can use Bitsquare. It is decentralised and cannot be shut down, not even in WA. Bitsquare does not hold any funds either so you cannot be scammed by them. No registration needed.
@_date: 2016-05-25 18:23:06
Download and try it out. Fiat is transferred using bank transfer, OKPay, PerfectMoney or AliPay. There is a security deposit and an arbiter in case something goes wrong. Escrow is used.
@_date: 2016-07-05 04:48:52
Why not use Bitsquare.io? 
Similar to LBC, but better interface, smaller scam risk and better prices. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:07:59
Works like a charm now. Offers at 2% or less to my advantage are always taken quite quickly. The profit is slightly higher since the 2% is counted on the ask or bid price which are different. It is thus possible to make a profit as a trader and it is puzzling why there are so few pro's trading. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:50:05
I have used it many times, both for fiat-btc and btc-altcoin trades. This is the only place where I trade btc. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:58:52
Bitsquare is not based on reputation, although a reputation system is developing on its own. Conflicts are resolved by arbitration and e. g cash in hand is impossible to arbitrate. Only arbitrable fiat-transfer methods are possible. So far no scams have been reported after about one thousand trades.
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:40:48
 Sent you a pm on forum.bitsquare.io about liquidity privision.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:46:59
Daytrading will occur if quick confirmation is implemented for btc-altcoins. 
For fiat-btc one has to do parallell trading, which rapidly becomes very confusing.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:17:58
It needs visibility. It is easier to use than LocalBitcoins apart from its other strong advantages. Hopefully there will be enough liquidity that everyone that comes for a trade can get one. More liquidity than that is not really needed. Spread the word since Bitsquare is a fantastic thing.
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:43:11
Bitsquare shares (or tokens) will be the next to be implemented. Before this any compensation will be in btc.
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:01:44
Bitsquare will get trading charts in the next version. You trade with peers and no money or btc is on the exchange. It works with general banks for national banktransfer. SEPA (euro), OKPay, PerfectMoney and AliPay is also available for international trades.
