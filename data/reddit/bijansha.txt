He knows blockchain can disrupt Facebook by offering ad-free and fully private social networks. He needs to understand the threat as Facebook’s CEO.

It can, with an update in the code. But a $100m valuation per bitcoin is not realistic. The world economy would be smaller than bitcoin marketcap:)

No. Just use Litecoin, bitcoin cash, or ethereum.

Crypto-Kitties is a great example of how Ethereum can enable smart contracts and digital assets. What's better than digital kitties to prove the desire for digital assets? If people are willing to pay 1000's of dollars for owning special digital cats, they'll pay for so many other digital assets.

Thanks. Just saw it now. 
I think your argument is valid around occupancy rate when I do the math from a # of transactions perspective. Now sure how you see connection between market cap and occupancy. Can you elaborate?

This could definitely contribute, given the fact that many exchanges don't publish transactions on blockchain and they use their own internal ledger.

Even as a store of value, there should be an increase in number of transactions to reflect people switch between store of value and money for day to day transactions. Looks like even that number is not increasing.

Do you disagree with the notion that the number of transactions is an indication of adoption? In your hotel example, I think the number of people in the front desk is not a good representation of success but of people using the hotel to stay overnight is because it hint at  adoption. 
given lightning network is not available yet, all transactions should appear on the blockchain today. And it looks like the total of them is not going up. This is a concern.

Thought of posting this for the bitcoin fans here as the graph is an indication of lack of adoption on 'bitcoin' to me. Looks like number of transactions per day has stayed around 300K over the past one year. Would like to know what the bitcoin fans think of it.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:03:24
really? You don't see the importance of adoption for making a new technology mainstream?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:07:41
That's an interesting point. You're saying it's reached its full capacity.
There are currently 6 new blocks per hour or 6x24 = 144 blocks per day. Given each block has around 2,000 transactions, the max number per day would be 144 x 2K = which is around the 300K that we see today. 
So, the only way for the transactions to continue increasing would be via increasing the block size or taking them off-chain, which doesn't seem to be happening soon. I'm wondering if this is going to stop the growth at least for a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:39:33
That's fair. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:55:19
I agree. This would be the only meaningful number on adoption of a blockchain technology.

Warren Buffet's quote "stock market is a vehicle for transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient" applies to here. I'm not a fan of Bitcoin and prefer other coins but panic-selling doesn't pay off in the long run.

I'm not suggesting it does but if the value of Bitcoin continues rising and the minimum possible processing incentive remains to be 1 satoshi, the processing costs for small payments might become too expensive if the value of bitcoin goes up significantly. Let's say a bitcoin is worth $1M. Then the cost of a 0.$02 transaction will be $0.01. This can make bitcoin unattractive for smaller value transactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:09:04
I don't see how a zero fee transaction is sustainable in the long run as a solution in real world. There needs to be incentive for an entity to facilitate a transaction. That incentive doesn't have to be financial but they need be rewarded one way or the other. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:38:18
Not bad. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:28:28
Thanks. What's stopping us from increasing the block size then? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:57:45
How fast is a transaction with Lightning Network now?
