"4. The stimulating effect on the local economy promotes business creation and therefore competition"

wow.. you've been really misled lol
Firstly, there's no printing money to fund the ubi, it's gonna come from a VAT.
1. UBI doesn't increase the total money supply
2. Consumers are still price sensitive, any company that tries to gouge customers will end up out-competed by those that don't
3. With consumer goods, supply increases when demand increases, driving prices back down
4. The stimulating effect on the local economy promotes business creation and therefore competition
5. Most inflation has been in healthcare, housing, and college tuition, not consumer goods. UBI helps people better deal with the actual sources of inflation, reducing the impact of inflation on the average person.
The Roosevelt Institute [found]( that adopting an annual $12,000 basic income for every adult U.S. citizen over the age of 18 would permanently grow the economy by 12.56-13.10 percent—or about $2.5 trillion by 2025—and it would increase the labor force by 4.5-4.7 million people.
This is because putting money in people’s hands grows the economy, particularly when those people need the money and will spend it. Imagine a small town in Missouri with 5,000 qualifying residents.
A $12,000 Freedom Dividend would bring an extra $60 million of additional income into the community, most of which would be spent locally.
Then imagine that playing out in every community in the country, big and small. Communities everywhere will have more vibrant local economies, creating more jobs and leading to new businesses.
