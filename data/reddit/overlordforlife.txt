Energy used to mine doesn't exist anymore.  The technology isn't owned by bitcoin. It is not going to upend the "banking cabal".  (small point- obviously the energy exists due to the conservation of mass and energy. It just isn't stored in the blockchain. Bitcoin won't heat my house.)

Bitcoin isn't the same as stock. 
If I could buy all the stock in Microsoft for 10 dollars, I would own all the real estate, intellectual property, contracts, and equipment that Microsoft owns. Everyone would agree that would be an incredible deal.
If I paid 500 trillion dollars for all of Microsoft, everyone would agree that I woefully overpaid.
The fair value of Microsoft is beyond a doubt somewhere between those extremes.
Bitcoin has no such concept of intrinsic value behind it.

However, if a six sided die lands on six a hundred times in a row, it becomes highly probable there is a bias.

TIL something can be younger than a decade and be viewed as "traditionally ".

I don't have any coin, and never would, but this still fascinates me.  I, also, enjoy getting feedback on things, any thing, from people that have different opinions than me.  To me, that's fun.
I don't think it will disappear, certainly not overnight, but, as far as I can tell, Bitcoin is not sustainable.  It's technology is not unique, and, to be frank, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to use.
Now, on the one hand, Bitcoin's success would be good for me as it would be great for semiconductor investments.  On the other hand, it's failure would be nice as I would finally be able to upgrade my graphics card without paying ridiculous prices, or having to wait.
Edit: fixed some grammar

The point is that just because something costs "x" to produce it doesn't mean that it is valued at that "x". This is because cost only affects the supply side of the equation.  Therefore, it holds that there is no intrinsic value of Bitcoin. Obviously, it has a market value. However,  that is supported by nothing other than perception. Therefore,  it is not analogous to stocks.

Bitcoin doesn't have quarters. Bitcoin doesn't have earnings.

More accurately, the energy that has been spent on mining is a sunk cost and does not contribute to the value.

My mistake.

A downturn of 20% over two months is a bear market.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:51:58
As a matter of fact, the energy required to mine is a liability, not an asset.

Serious question... why would suppliers of goods and services adopt Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:46:37
Yes... that is the other side of what I said. The take away is that, the more times in a row that you get a six, the higher the probability that there is a bias.

Just to be clear, there is no such thing as investing in Bitcoin.  There is speculation in Bitcoin.  This does not mean to denigrate speculation.  There are people good at speculation. However, Bitcoin, in, and of, itself, does not generate future value. People enjoy gains based on people betting wrongly against their positions.

If nobody wants it, they can't sell it. Pretty simple concept. Also, if the price drops below the point it is profitable to mine, the whole thing falls apart. Pretty simple concept.

Bitcoin isn't something anybody has to have.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:24:21
Once again, that's a cost not a gain. Bitcoins take energy. They don't give it.
It takes energy for me to dig a shovel full of dirt, but, if I brought it to someone, they would say "get that shit out of my house!"
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:31:53
It's just the demand side of the equation. I think that's a thing.  Supply and demand.... does that sound right? Am I spelling that correctly?
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:40:24
If the reasons you bought bitcoin still exist now, you should hold. If you bought just because you thought you could sell at a higher price for no other reason than you thought someone would pay more, you should sell, unless you are comfortable with straight up gambling with a low expectation of a positive return.
Full Disclosure: I could never find a reason to buy bitcoin. I am just fascinated by what I perceive to be bubbles. But that's just me. You do you.
