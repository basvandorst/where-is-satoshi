900k correction; how Bitcoin is the largest scam ever seen
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:07:02
You do realise there is extremely heavy market manipulation to keep btc down, ontop of piles of Fud, ontop of the crypto market cap as a whole being less than 1/200th of that of the stock market, ontop of many many more factors.
We are just getting started my friend
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:38:31
This is exactly feel, I feel as though all of this BS against BTC, deliberate or not, is akin to a Cartoon Character playing twister to plug all of the holes, and pretty soon the pressure is going to get to the point, just like in the cartoons, where it is too much and the pipe explodes massively into the largest bull run we have ever seen (we're talking 50-100k or even higher)

Big Money giving it all they got to shake out the weak hands before they invest fully into it and have a bigger run up than ever before.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:37:38
Im too not sure what a public key is..
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:34:49
Well one positive news in the face of 300 million news fud dumps to turn it green is pretty impressive
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:24:33
Just search 'Bitcoin' on google
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:15:47
Well, we are screwed either way if that happens, so f it
