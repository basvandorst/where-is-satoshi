I mean, does it even matter? All major Chinese companies are effectively extended arms of the government.

Lol dude, China is one of the most racist countries out there today.
Beyond that, though, a lot of your criticism is on point. What of it? The US *does* have a gun violence problem. While they may not see many of the good things about the US, many of the bad things they see are not false. Just like it's not false that China is under the control of a brutal dictatorship and totalitarian surveillance state that's literally running concentration camps, relentlessly tracking everyday citizens in everything they do, imprisoning or outright "disappearing" dissenters, and wielding unprecedented control and leverage over individuals via a social credit system that affects every facet of their life.
The average Westerner probably doesn't appreciate the good changes that have happened in China since the 60s and 70s. But that doesn't make any of the above false.

You're not allowed to suggest there might be a bubble in this subreddit. Everybody here is going to be amazingly rich in the next few years off bitcoin.

It's much riskier in that time frame...
Invest in bitcoin because you believe it's going to achieve a huge market capitalization going forward and will eventually be used as a currency all over the place.
If you don't believe that, don't invest in it, because you're not going to predict the market on a day-to-day basis.

The people who bought some bitcoins when they were $1/btc did not take a "huge" risk unless they bought many, many thousands of bitcoins. The people buying a few bitcoins at $1000/btc are taking a much bigger risk.
