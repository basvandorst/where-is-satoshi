God it better not fail again...
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:15:57
Oh god, i'd buy so much things on aliexpress if they started accepting crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:36:35
They should just legalize weed too while they are at it.
Can't be worse for them than their alcohol intake.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:04:20
Other coins.
At least that would bring it closer to his number.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:11:29
Because Aliexpress has a lot of stupid useless things... but things i can't resist nonetheless.
Like a fake lego russian soviet army, german ww2 fake lego.
Stupid masks, fake skulls, home decor things, usb nintendo 64 gaming controllers, tshirts...
Aliexpress has everything. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:42:49
Thats she in Dutch.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:02:27
If you have no income i personally wouldn't man.
10% tops maybe...
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:21:00
I'm already using fiat there yeah...
Doesn't change the fact i'd also like crypto to be able to pay there.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:48:16
I think he means combined with other crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:17:20
THIS ARTICLE IS OBSOLETE!
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:00:17
Guess i'll quit work too.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:11:57
We don't even need to move it.
It's already there, and here, and everywhere!
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:50:28
Have you tried calling..?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:23:14
It's bad enough that I keep checking the prices all day at work. 
Kinda do need my sleep too...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:47
No one can really decide for you, but that's what quite a few people are doing yes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:43:47
Bitcoin cash me outside how bout dat
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:51:39
Pay per view...
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:22:39
Yeah, suggest him a site that can't stay up for longer than 2 minutes...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:24
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:18:00
Probably one of the best reasons to cash out imo.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:44:51
Sell and don't rebuy...
You are not up for this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:50:26
I'm vegan and this is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:58:21
It has greatly improved in the past week or so tho.
I have been able to use the site with virtually no crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:26:57
If you owned bitcoin before the fork you own bcash...
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:44:20
Didn't a family kill them self over this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:52
Altho I'm still way up from when I got in in 2015, so I can't complain either way.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:51:14
Dark net markets?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:06
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:45
That's what I've been asking myself since I saw the other post.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:45:56
Best I can do is 1 dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:50:06
Was a post here on reddit.
I'd try to find it but I'm at work at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:09:57
Bought the dip, already in the green
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:05:52
I don't blame you really.
I have completely given up on getting tier 3 verified for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:00:58
No, HODL or buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:41:10
That fork is a scam fork.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:51:50
I'm guessing they cashed out tho?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:43:16
They kinda blew up...
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:58:15
Aren't they upgrading their engine on the 11th?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:13
Heres mine, basically for free.
Buy low, don't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:53
Didn't say what year!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:14:37
You must be new...
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:01:51
I've been in for 2 years and only bought more in past month too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:32:01
If I had been you I'd had kept at least 10 to be honest.
Enough to make a difference if the price skyrockets, and not enough to put a serious dent in you cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:15
Yeah I have work in like 7 hours...
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:00
There was a thread about it last week that I now can't find.
Only thing I can find again this while  on mobile 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:45:28
Oh he's done far worse things than cocaïne...
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:37:16
This isn't even a proper dip tbh.
Welcome to the rodeo tho!
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:48:13
That's the perfect way to think about it!
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:31:19
Wait you do what..?
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:07:27
Conor is sitting in the comfort of his home in Ireland.
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:03:31
Yeah exactly.
But it seems not everyone has a brain for proper opsec.
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:11:06
Naaah, just has to show up in court next month i believe.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:55:24
They would monitor know dnm adresses id guess.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:14:44
UFC fighter Tarec Saffiedine is also getting very hyped by the rising prices of bitcoin.
He's been posting about it for a while now on his facebook.
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:49:42
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:01:06
Welcome to the ride.
Don't get freaked out when we dip.
We have always risen above afterwards.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:32
Massive amounts of attention and movement in the markets.
I suspect it's the surge of new people doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:34:26
Tripsit.me 
A drug harm reduction network
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:39:52
You buy during dips, not sell.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:38:41
This is only the 30th post in past half hour...
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:45:49
He's getting geared up for it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:26:17
I can almost taste your salt
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:29:39
Did mine yesterday and was in my account today. 
Might depend on the bank I guess?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:53:06
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:38:38
Not a lot, but for the people over there it can mean life or death...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:32
Didn't even need 10 days!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:19:07
Yeah, should be done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:20
Buy buy buy
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:20:39
New people don't google "what is bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:37:03
They already have one... on their mothers house.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:26:46
Pretty good, looking into increasing my holdings, deciding if i'll make a pizza or  make burgers tonight... decisions decisions.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:39:08
and 240.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:33:09
They ran out of fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:12:21
You Borat or some shit?
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:38:33
A goose flew into his face...
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:05:26
Wouldnt this be really easy to use to locate miners then?
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:25:02
Pizza it is then!
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:48:33
I mean, isn't this the kind of thing tot want to get out only once its completely finalised?
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:02:09
Its a coffeeshop isn't it?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:06:39
It makes fucking sense now...
Bcash gets pumped, and now he's on infowars...
This is fucking insanity ahahahaha.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:19:54


@_date: 2017-09-27 13:39:04
This is the right way to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:32:43
Just keep it and forget about it.
Focus on your business and just keep it as a rainy day fund.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:31:39
Don't put all your eggs in one basket is all i'm going to say.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:34:17
A Mexican one at that!
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:30:24
He probably means DCK, a research chemical. McAfee loves research chemicals.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:23:40
Amazon seems like a fair option tbh.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:22:08
A dip always follows, followed by another increase, and so on...
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:45:46
I'd love one!
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:03:57
Germany as in Amazon.de?
Or just germany.
If its Amazon.de Belgians also can buy there. (We dont have our own)
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:59:02
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:22:22
Belgium please!
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:00:51
You do realise it's only called Evil-Corp in Eliott's head right?
We the viewers are viewing the story from Eliott's perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:51:24
Sure, let me check my wallet...
How about 3.50 euro?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:19:49
PSA: This is incredibly straining on the heart.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:09:28
Imagine paying the amounts they must have done for the account, only to have it suspended
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:52:25
Is this thing still going on haha?
