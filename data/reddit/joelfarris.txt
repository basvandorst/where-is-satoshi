When SubShopHero calls you out over $1600 a month, you know your bar is set too low.

...and the world has been waiting for them to finally do that very thing, so now we can get all the stores and vendors to swap over to a point-of-sale system that *everyone* can use.
Think of this as the next-generation version of "You mean if I put one of these 'tap to pay' terminals into my store, I can accept both her Visa card *and* his Mastercard? Sure, I'll take one.

I know, right!? For someone who knows which five commands to run, in what order, you'd expect to pay like $250-$300!!
Such a deal, such a deal.

If you're posting a picture of it, it's already been invented.

Good eye! George's is great.

Yes, they are, and as mentioned elsewhere this thread, expensive to develop plugins for as well.
However, if OP was to take this invention to something like square up.com who's business model is to *replace* the existing pos systems with wifi-enabled credit card swiping mobile devices, it might actually go somewhere?
EDIT: Well, well, the things you learn because of a Reddit post. I did a little research just now, and as of April 2014, Square actually *has* rolled out some integrated Bitcoin support for their Square Market POS!  However, it does not have any tie-in to a paper receipt. Bummer. :( Or possibly not a bummer, depending on your opinion of thermo-paper :)

Uhh, this word 'invention'? I do not think it means what you think it means.
The very fact that you dreamed up and created this image means that you *have* invented this idea. And, if no one comes forward to challenge your invention with their own prior art, you shall forever remain its inventor.
(Now who's an idiot?)

A strong electro magnetic pulse induces a current flow into any circuit it passes through. Doesn't matter if it's on or off. If it can conduct a current, it will.

"I want him dead. Dead! Do you hear me!? How much is this gonna cost?"
"It can be arranged for, say, 30,000 coin?..."
Kidding but in all seriousness, gratz to Silk Road for getting their coins back!

$18,000 of that price is probably to make it so people can't break into it and steal all the little cash-es.
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:57:16
When compared to which other currency?

Woah! So is this an exponential expansion?
1MB block = 2MB RAM
2MB block = 8MB RAM
4MB block = 16MB RAM?
Most portables currently cap out at ~16MB RAM, so an 8MB block size would need 32MB of RAM just to run a background-verify that the off-chain signatures are valid or not!?
What happens when blocks become 14-16MB in size?
BRB, starting up the  "platform", who's with me? (But seriously, does it have to come to this?)

Dude, like, all you have to do is steal anyone's laptop + phone to do that. But, the key factor here, is that you DON'T TELL EVERYONE YOUR TARGET!

This is what happens when things get named too soon, by too few, and without thought for how the general public will eventually have to perceive it and deal with it on a day-to-day basis.
Nobody wants coins, they want dollars. Real money. The entire world knows that coins are nothing but an inconvenience; flat, weighty circles of metal that slow them down and cannot be rapidly utilized for transacting business.
And in today's digital world, you cannot put these digital "coins" into a "wallet". Because they don't exist in "your" wallet. They exist in the public ledger. You shouldn't even have a wallet, you should have a keychain that grants you access to your money whenever you want to send it somewhere.
In light of this, I'm fairly certain that at some point in the future, anything with the word "coin" or "cash" in it will become as unwanted as a hyper-inflated, four billion dollar dollar bill, ya'll.
Name your stuff with a short, unique, preferably one-word name that actually infers meaning and will promote mass adoption. Stop being so geeky about everything; It doesn't have to explain what it does. The "Dollar" is a word that people had to learn. It doesn't explain that the Dollar came from a "bit" and is similar to a "coin". It's just a Dollar. Monero, Stratis, Steem. These are all shining examples of unique one-word naming conventions that people will accept out of hand because they're simple, easy to remember, and catchy, and they'll figure out what it is and how to use it later.
TL;DR: The U.S. Dollar doesn't try to explain what it is. It just is.

If I wanted to hide an ongoing mining operation, I'd stack all the working units on pallets, wire them up, and then wrap the exterior in a cardboard facade that was airbrushed to look like a bunch of incoming parts boxes.
Plus, security by obscurity would help to protect my functioning hardware from theft by people who look up my address on google maps and just wander through the place. ;)
