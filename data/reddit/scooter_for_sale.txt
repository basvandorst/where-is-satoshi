Let's say it's basically impossible to social engineer a hack on satoshi since nobody even knows who he is. Maybe Satoshis wallet will be a testament to the security of blockchain. It will stand as an ultimate prize, the obvious target for anyone attempting to cheat the blockchain. As long as his wallet remains untouched, we know that blockchain remains undefeated.

Some might remember when Email and internet were synonymous back in the early 90's. I see Bitcoin to blockchain as Email was to internet in that time. I think it was Andreas Antonopolous who put this illustration in my head, sometime after investing. 
Anyway, I believe Bitcoin is understood and seen by the masses as Email and internet were in the early 90's. Bitcoin is email and I'm looking forward to smartphones. I'm not holding bitcoin to exchange for dollars, I'm holding it, waiting for when it replaces dollars.

Whatever amount it us you're thinking of exchanging, just break it up in fractions and dollar cost average. You'll lose a few bucks on fees, but you'll make that back in a day or two.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:37:55
I think it would be smart for me to be paying attention, so i can find out and take action accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:13:39
Yea, I wanna know when they launch, so I can be watching the charts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:37:20
Sorry, that was a bad word to use. I meant more like qualitative vs quantitative, but I also wasn't specifically referring to you. I was being more general.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:09:16
Yea, im just watching gdax. I watch the buy/sell history which seems to happen in real time as it coincides with the movement of price. I watched a 500btc buy punch through the 18k barrier. 
Where would you recommend watching real time buy/sell orders other than what's on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:52:37
It's a great idea. It's a lot easier to learn how to HODL and build interest and knowledge while you dollar cost average. You'll have the tools and better mental strength to weather the storms when your collection is much larger.

I always thought it was or would eventually be the equivalent of however much money was exchange for the total amount of bitcoin, including the energy costs for mining it  seems like a foundation value. I mean, if i paid $1,000 for all the bitcoin, at that moment it would lsrgely be considered to be worth $1,000 or 200 cheese burgers, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:55:47
My suggestion would be to set a limit of 25k or January 1st. Which ever comes first. Why pull out profits now? Bitcoin value is itching to break out. It might have a small correction first, which would be great and yield better momentum when it breaks out, but right now, it looks like we are currently at the low before a break out and onto 20k by Christmas.

I predict that in 8 hours, some people are going to be sitting around, staring at graphs, waiting for some loud explosion or whatever it is they think futures are.

I use blockfolio. Allows me to keep a detailed ledger of all my transactions with real time percentages for each and an accurate profit/loss value based on all those transactions. 
It supports candle and line graphs for all trading pairs from all exchanges.
Oh, and it's free.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:47:37
I mostly HODL, but I try to forecast the big dips so I can sell and buy low. At first I was breaking even, but I've gotten a lot better and get an extra few % here and there.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:35:56
That was actually a guess of mine too. Other guesses are really wealthy, libertarian, blockchain supporters, and someone(s) who's gonna jack the price up and short it before they dump.
Just curious, anyone else see the .1000000 sells like every 1 or 2 seconds for the last hour?

I think it starts now and is official at 15k. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:19:10
I believe so. I'm convinced there will be different currencies based on context. Litecoin, for example, is already better than bitcoin for quick transactions. Ethereum for smart contracts. Bitcoin is the flag ship crypto and has the most adoption which I think secures it's place, long term, amongst what will be the mainstream cryptos, but it will undoubtedly be outperformed in certain contexts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:54
They will be context based.

Put in a little, twice a week. Like $25 - $100 at a time and start learning about the psychology of investment. Get interested in watching your money, learn where the good sources are for info, build intuition on how the market works and get good with graphs. Do this until a short while after the futures launch, imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:53
I use it. It's faster and lower fee.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:45:55
Obviously there is a MASSIVE demand for economical miners. Demand is not only going to make mining more ecologically and economically more efficient, it's undoubtedly going to translate over to other consumer markets, as well.

I sold half the other day and bought back in at $8,800. When it goes up too long or too fast, I sell off a little and buy back in. It's worked a few times, so far I've profited from it, overcoming the bad trade decisions.

Go find the Reddit post from the Venezuelan who relies on bitcoin to survive. There are billions living in countries where their governments have them on financial lockdown because the currency is hyper-inflated. Not to mention places where the bankers literally are the gangsters and the countless people who only have the capability to trade in the local market, but will now have access to a GLOBAL economy. To hell with bitcoin value coming from being bought. It has literal, intrinsic value. Access to a global market is a fuck load more valuable than a piece of gold.
 You are really lacking perspective, man.

@_date: 2017-12-06 03:54:32
I've seen this a few times now, not sure why nobody else has been bringing up or maybe they have. Seems when the price hangs around these even numbers, it'll suddenly get a huge volume indicator and instantly blow way past. Big volume indicator and price drop within 24 hours followed by a bounce back.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:14:21
Oh, forgot to clarify, it's the brand name and symbology of Bitcoin that inspires me to stay invested in it. I keep Ether too.

What do you intend on doing with an extra $100? No offense, but that's not even much for a homeless person. If I was going to limit my investment to only $100, i'd just forget about it for a couple years.

I would also like to better understand this. Funny, a million posts asking what will happen and not a damn one asking how to understand the graph.

The only effect futures are going to have is purely psychological. Futures aren't bitcoin be traded, bought, or sold. It's betting dollars on the value either going up or down 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:16:05
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:58:26
It seems so obvious now lol. I knew this was coming, but most of the time I think I should sell, it's a mistake. I'm holding. Just gonna keep buying when it's low, so I can see some profit sooner. Gonna be cringing when I drop below the profit line, though 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:28
All the people selling, right now, are going to buy back in after they realize futures isn't a space alien that eats bitcoin value. I predict an immediate return to sub 16k over the next 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:38:28
Net neutrality was the government getting involved. Repealing it is the government losing it's involvement. Secondly, net neutrality was only just recently a thing and everything was absolutely fine before that. I keep seeing posts about this and can not, for the life of me, understand the concern in general or more specifically how crypto currencies would at all be effected.

This is why I sold. I could totally be wrong, but look at the past month chart. We are way above the trend line. Personally, I've been watching that since Monday and now more experienced people are showing those predictions. These are just day traders predictions, not emotional what have you.

I'm definitely not positive. How could I be? I'm confident enough to have sold off a good chunk, this morning, but that still a gamble. If I was positive, I would've liquidated it all.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:30:56
I disagree. Everyone overloading the blockchain and associated networks/private enterprise serving bitcoin users, is rapidly revealing opportunities for infrastructure improvement at a very, very early stage in blockchain/bitcoin adoption and utilization.

How can you see buy orders in USD on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:54
I hope so. I'm conflicted, though. Wouldn't mind an opportunity to buy some more at sub 13k before the end of the year.

Ideological desire for it to have value? How is access to a global market for billions who barely have access to ID, let alone banking, an ideological desire? 
Not to mention people in hyper inflated countries like Venezuela where the government has banned the exchange of their worthless currency despite their being no exports from said country and so supplies can no longer be imported because nobody wants to accept their worthless money.
Access to global commerce and transactions is tangibly priceless to many, many, many people. In Colombia there are people without food and water and gangsters are robbing people for the aid money that gets sent to them. For these people, a secure, digital currency that doesn't require them to expose themselves to be followed to a WU location where the sender paid 30% fees and robbed or even have ID for that matter, is highly valuable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:07

People see this as a bad thing, but it isn't. HODL on, imo. This is only going to cause stress until the value surges back up, that's the only warning part. It's otherwise an opportunity to buy low. Assuming there's actually a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:15:52
I hope it settles down. Currently a $400 difference...

From what I can gather, the site only seems to mention "ticker symbol conventions for Calendar Spread Trading". It says BTCF8 - BTCH8 is an example of Jan18th/Mar18th spread.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:54:36
The INTRINSIC VALUE of bitcoin or crypto in general is in the liberation of billions of people who have no access to banking or anyway of making long distance transactions. It liberates people in hyper inflated countries or who otherwise only have access to trade in local markets. 
Access to hypothetically immediate transactions of funds that are immediately accessible from/to any geographic location with only tiny fees and no third party involvement, is intrinsically more valuable than gold which is shiny. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:45:43
The market price for bitcoin probably is a bubble, but bitcoin is not a bubble. It has more intrinsic value than gold considering it's potential in poorer countries.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:24:33
I agree, but I'm fairly convinced it's either after a correction below 15k or what appears to be more likely as the day closes here, a mostly lateral move to the trend lines. A dip woukd spur on a lot of new vitality.

I've done it several times. Catching $50 - $100 falls here and there. Waiting for the one that really drops.

I disagree. People like them are what will pave the way. Blockchain is what's most important. Satoshi was a genius and knew that pandering to greed by using blockchain as a currency, first, was the key to it's success. Or maybe he got lucky, but either way, bitcoin just needs enough momentum, even if it's superficial, to survive the assault and be validated and globally trusted.

On the fence about selling now and buying back in after the split. You do realize there's a chance we can lose massively after the split, right? I'm a big supporter of crypto currencies, but that's no reason to lose tremendous amount of money unnecessarily.
