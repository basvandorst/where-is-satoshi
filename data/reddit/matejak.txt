No, It's actually not. 
Lobbying groups and corporations influencing the political process? Sure, that's well documented. There's a lot of great theories about that.
Global elites creating synthetic business cycles to grow their wealth? That goes directly into the "conspiracy theories" domain, and if you're actually a major in Economics it's a real shame that you believe in that. 
A Youtube vid with questionable design choices and a robotic voice about the Bilderberg group that you watched at 3 A.M. doesn't constitute evidence.

It's not a binary phenomenon, there's different grades.
And anwering your question, it depends on what you are looking at, there's no one universal measure of inequality. I mean, the famous 1% getting more richier? True. But then if you look at the inter-country inequality, it's decreasing (mainly because of China and India). It's a really complex matter.
But believe me, I'm not trying to sound cocky but inequality rising without taxation is a very obvious thing.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:01:05
Those are all very vague affirmations, vecino. That's the main problem with people like you. Let's see:


Where? 


Where? What kind of inequality you're talking about? What measure of inequality you're talking about? 


Where did I said that?

Agents of the economy incorporate that information, yeah. If unions work well then the income of labor will be adjusted so there's actually no lost in real terms. I'm from Argentina, I know a few things about how inflation works, believe me.
And It's not about getting real or whatever catchphrases you want to use, It's about getting serious and rigorous if you actually want to understand reality. I don't know you, I don't have any reason to think bad about you or your intentions, you just seem to be into that radicalized mindset that doesn't correspond with reality and hard numbers. This ([1]( [2]( [3]( doesn't seem to be broken system. It's a system with several issues but a lot of great things too, so why don't we focus on discussing and fixing the bad things instead of getting apocalyptic?  don't you think that's better?
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:41:14
Haha it wasn't individual, that's why I clarify in brackets.
It's aimed to the average libertarian bitcoiner not trained in Economics nor Finance that likes conspiracy shit and that kind of quotes with black backgrounds like the one posted by OP.
IF you feel identified into that group, trust me (?), don't trust yourself that much. You know nothing and you can end up losing a lot of money.

I might have misunderstood it, but I think the message I answered had a a problem with central banks having the possibility of using monetary policy as a tool, not with a specific policy.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:13:38
It probably shocked me some years ago in my econ 101 introductory courses. Thing with people like you is that you just discovered (and clearly didn't understand) things that have been studied since a lot of decades ago. And are not as emotional as you guys like to think. 
I'm also gonna use my "I'm Argentinian" card again. Don't dare to try to talk about monetary policy in a condescending way with me again. We born understanding how all this jungle works, it's a survival need.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:28:21
It's a little bit too volatile, even for us.
But considering the Argentine peso situation we are always looking for store of value assets alternatives (although the dollar will be the main option for many years) so BTC got pretty big in here.
Personally, I see it as a short term investment. I also think that is now impossible that it will ever become a convenient medium of exchange, so that goes against the possibility a stable long term appreciation. 
Overall, I'm just trying to take advantage of short term fluctuations and I don't trust the BITCOIN IS GOING TO TAKE THE WORLD forecasts.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:51:37
No ad hom cause there's no argument there. It's just me saying exactly that to you.
I stopped the argumentation after the exact moment you brought the Rothschild figure, arguably the mother of all the conspiracy theories. 
I might be naive, but I seriously think that most of the people doesn't have bad intentions, It's just ignorance. I was a teenager watching vids about Illuminati shit too, that's why I know it gets better if you try it. If you or any person reading this can realize why that's so wrong, then I'd would be a happy man.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:16:27
I just reread the comment I answered and you're right, he's just describing. The original comment though wasn't criticising a specific policy, was criticising the existence of the central bank system.
A lot of libertarians have a problem with the existence of monetary policy as a tool because they don't think there should be a centralized institution monopolizing that tool.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:42:46
Oh my.. no? 
Then you have the old backward looking vs. forward looking labor negotiations debate, but to get into that debate you need a basic understanding of labor markets functioning that you don't seem to have, so what's the point.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:05:33
I did my undergrad Thesis on QE, my advisor was working un WS during the subprime. I also had a subject called Money, Credit and Banks (which is focused on the US finance system as the finance center of the world) among other many subjects that are about monetary policy in general.
Really dude, I know conspiracy runs through the veins of people like you, but this subjects are not as mysterious as you would like to believe. Are very technical, teorethical, and boring. Sorry not to contribute to your fantasy epic world.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:37:12
Then you vote a party that won't go to war. Or at least one that is less prone to do it. 
That's how you canalize your preferencies in term of public policies, by voting. It's totally imperfect, yeah, but it's the best available system. 
Or at least way better that your neurotic anarchy. Go to study.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:14:19
Rising inequality.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:19:51
I don't think that constitutes an argument because I'm not argumenting with you. You go to study, learn the basics and then we can discuss.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:40:12
Yeah, governments are mostly inefficient and full corruption, but that doesn't mean taxation shouldn't exist.
Seriously, they have no idea about the distributive consequences of a society without a central government collecting taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:26:24
Inflation it's not theft (it's not a tax neither), it's an unwanted (well, not always, low levels of inflation can stimulate consumption) consequence of the monetary police and other economic phenomena.
And it's not invisible, there's something called CPI that informs people about the inflation level of the last period, so they can form their expectations for the next period and then make their consumption and savings decisions. There's also financial assets that protect your purchasing power so you don't lose that 1%.
Seriously, I don't want to be rude but it seems that you just discover some econ101 things that's been studied for a lot years.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:17:10
What's your problem with monetary policy? You are not very much into Economics, aren't you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:45:59
Because there's no argument to counter. You are the one who should prove that the FED is ran like a puppet by a group that rules the world.
Banks and corporations have lobby power, access to internal information and so on. But there's big difference between considering those facts and believing that there's actually secret societies over the government conspiring to control every economic variable.
That's when I have nothing else to discuss with you. It's up to you if you want to be better and start to unravel all that shit or if you just want to keep spreading it. Like I said, nothing personal, I really hope this inspires you (even though you won't admit it) to be a little less gullible and stop buying all that toxic shit, but there's nothing else I can said or do I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:22:25
No, they don't. It doesn't work like that.
Stop doing this. I'm sure you're not a bad guy and that you have room to keep improving as a person. Just stay away for conspiracy theories, please.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:56:13
Because I studied (and keep studying) Economics for more than 6 years now.
It's not even up to discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:32:42
You (as a group of similar people) are clearly VERY ignorant in terms of understanding how the economy works and you're also prone to believe conspiracy theories.
So yeah, I would say you shouldn't trust that much in yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:40:57
I never said it the system wasn't up to discussion, why do you say that? 
I'm going to assume that the problem is the language barrier and not that you have reading comprehension problems. 
Con el español como te llevas amiguito? Si me decis puedo probar en portugues tambien, ningun drama. Como vos quieras.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:16:43
Guys, I don't wanna be offensive, but trust me, you are all ignorant and inclined to believe in conspiracy theories (which it's actually the same thing) so don't trust yourselves.
Seriously, insult me, downvote me, whatever. But remember this, don't trust that much in yourselves, specially your financial decisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:00


Have read those authors doesn't equal being trained in Economics and Finance. Moreover, have read JUST those authors might have harmed your understanding of how the economic system worked across the years. I've been forced to read a lot (believe me, a lot) about economics, and reading opposing visions it's a fascinating intellectual exercise.
I love how Hayek explains the price system, I think Mises doesn't add too much to history of economic thinking and I haven't read Hazlitt. Overall, I think the biggest contribution of the Austrian School is to the Epistemology of Economics. 
I don't add to a particular school as magic solution of the all the economics problems, but some of my points of reference are Smith, Friedman, Arrow, Akerlof and Thaler.


Do you trust yourself?
Haha don't take it that seriously. :) I'm very skeptic, I'm constantly questioning my beliefs. The stereotype I described is usually a little neurotic and idealistic, so it was just a recommendation. That you just let those ideas aside for a while to understand how the world really works.
