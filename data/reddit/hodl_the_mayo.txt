My thoughts exactly. If (when) the economy dips, the tough choice will be when and how much to pull out of BTC and put into discounted real estate.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:17:25
Nope. I captured equity while it's available. I don't need to complicate life by moving. The resale value only matters if I'm "re-selling". I like my house and neighborhood. I'd be happy to continue living here until the market recovers. 
I've also been conservative in my refi, leaving enough equity on the table to allow a dip and sell if I had to without getting real hurt.

Some is in the exchange. Some is in cold wallets. The trade-off is the risk of an exchange vs the complexity of my wife understanding how to cash out from a Trezor.

It's always a struggle. One the one hand, it's wise to diversify investments. On the other hand, if you really believe in something, it feels stupid to put money on "the slower horse" when you think you've identified the "sure winner". 
I have a modest job with a modest paycheck. I'm not rich by any means. I'm pretty frugal. I have diversified. And with age, my appetite for risk has wained. But,  I think this one has legs. I'm not "all in" because I owe it to my wife to keep my wits about me. But, with equity earning zero interest and savings earning a tenth of a percent each year, I didn't want my frugality and savings to be in vain.

You should get out more. I only aspire to be the biggest at something. But, alas, there are other for more experienced and accomplished than I.

I haven't looked at that. I will now. But, as you may see from my other posts, I can't get so complicated that my wife is "blockchain rich" but "dirt poor" in the event of my untimely demise. (It needs to be just complicated enough that she has incentive to keep me alive!��)

I have other investments (stocks, 401k, etc), but nothing has the potential like BTC.
I had equity sitting there earning nothing, yet traditional wisdom would congratulate me for paying my house down. That's cool, but a paid off house let's me retire better, not sooner.
I considered old school ideas like investing in real estate, but if the market crashes again (and I personally think it will in the next couple of years), it would take too long to exit.
On the other hand, I can sell BTC very quickly if things get ugly. It may ebb and flo, but I don't think it would ever plummet so quickly that I couldn't minimize losses.
I can set stop/limit orders to auto eject if it gets too dramatic. I'll nudge those limits up regularly as things climb.
Who knows what the future holds, but I see a need that BTC can fill. While it's an investment in first world countries, it may be a lifeline in less development or stable countries. Either way, there should be a demand long enough for me to unload, should I need.

In gambling, the house always wins.
In Bitcoin, there is no house!
In my conservative investment, I will still have a house either way.

You know, I really wish there was a group for non-techy spouses. I feel that the DIY tech support aspect of crypto is an impediment to adoption.
I personally love the decentralized, non-government, non-corporate aspects, but that's scary to the spouses, parents, grand parents who are so afraid of screwing up or forgetting seeds that they would rather stay with the devil they know.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:33:13
Thanks. I've been "duck hunting" for awhile.
I wanted to do this when BTC was $3,000, but that was too early on and scary for the Mrs.
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:45:26
Thanks! The real MVP is my wife.
I did this based on research and logic.
She agreed based on faith in me.
I hope her faith was well placed!

Got 'em. Three different Trezors in RFID resistant bags that are in fireproof bags that are in fireproof safes.
I've put together a "so I guess I'm dead now" plan for my wife so that she knows how to access everything if I'm gone. Passwords, account numbers, docs, etc are stored in a password manager. She has the names of a couple of trusted friends and colleagues who are crypto savvy in case she gets lost.
She, and her sisters, each have separate Coinbase accounts with small amounts invested so that they can follow and understand what to do.
I have also setup a small college BTC account for a couple of grandkids. I made the offer to each kid that I would match up to $100 if they would put money in BTC and leave it until they graduate high school. (The grandkids aren't even in kindergarten yet.)
I figured the more family members who are aware of crypto, and can have a reasonable conversation, the less alone and stranded my wife would feel if she has to deal with it after I'm gone.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:49:20
Yes. Hence the timing. It would have been awesome to get in at a lower price. But there was no track record and it would have been much scarier.
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:34:25
No, I think losing it all is the worst case. I still wouldn't lose my house. But I'd have to work until 67 and travel less.
If BTC went below my entry point, and showed no signs of recovery in my timeframe, I'd cut my losses, cash out, use the losses to offset my gains on other investments and still be OK.

Dude... I wish I had woken up then. I lost $8,000 in an oil stock in 2011. I would be retired now if I'd known more about BTC then.

That's why I don't day trade. I'm a small fish compared to a big whale. But, I'm like that little fish that follows the whale to clean up the scraps. 
I feel like that, if my goals are aligned with the whale goals, I can benefit.
There's a time when"they" want it to go down, for a good buy. And, it does.
But, ultimately, "they" also need it to go up, for the big sale. That works for me too!

BTC could go to zero and I wouldn't be homeless. I would, however, be in one helluva dog house.
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:48:24
My refi is 3.5% APR. If BTC increases more than that per year (hence my ballpark 4% threshold), I'm not losing anything by borrowing against equity.
BTW, my APR decreased from the prior mortgage rate, so saving there already.

I have made the promise to her that if, after 1 year and the there's enough to payoff the house, she is too nervous, I'll cash out, shut up and keep working.
Otherwise, given a little wiggle room for fluctuations, I'll keep it in and maintain stop limits that will auto cash out with enough to pay off the house if the market plummets.
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:43:08
I did a single, six figure wire transfer the day after the refi funded. Straight from my credit union to Coinbase Pro.
My butthole was puckered the whole time the funds were in transit. But, it really couldn't have been easier.
My "plan" was to buy in chunks, using tiers of limit orders.
That plan went out the window right away. We went out of town to look at retirement property in the mountains. The spotty WiFi made me nervous. At 3 am, after waking and checking Coinbase numerous times, I saw a dip and it started heading up. I cancelled the limit orders and did a single market order.
Of course, it went down right after that. So, with hindsight, I could have gotten a little more bang for my buck if I had waited. But, it never dipped to my limit, so my original order would never have been filled.
Over all, I bought in below $10k. And I'm satisfied. When it goes up significantly, the small change won't matter.
I few of us at work have been buying here and there for a couple of years. I've generally just bought at market price when the news and numbers looked good. Some of my colleagues have tried be Wall Street moguls and have set unrealistic limit orders. They have lots of stories about "the one that got away", having missed their trigger by a few dollars. Meanwhile, I have Bitcoin.
Man, I'm going to miss those guys when I retire... Nope. I'll be the one that got away!
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:07:15
You are correct. Kids these days. I can't even...
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:46:33
I made a big BTC investment using my home equity.
But 401k is different. You will pay a big penalty for withdrawal and have no parachute.
I reduced, but didn't eliminate, my 401k and stock savings, and put it towards BTC. I am bullish on BTC, but a slower growth backup plan helps me sleep soundly.
But, I'm an anonymous stranger giving unsolicited advice. You do you.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:10:47
See other posts. I agree, but there has to be a mix of secure and easy for my wife to figure out "over my dead body".

I have tried to be gracious and helpful in answering these questions and comments. I considered ignoring yours, but I won't...
You assume that I am irresponsible and selfish. Yet you know nothing at all about me, my wife or our situation in life. You know nothing about her physical condition or the pain and effort it takes to continue working. You assume that I'm in this for a joyride, a grand experiment, a gambler's high or my personal "lambo to the moon".
You. Know. Nothing.
I am far from irresponsible and selfish. I am trying everything in my power to provide for the best physical and economic health for my wife. 
But, this is what I know about you. You are toxic. You are judgemental. You make assumptions without knowledge. And you hide behind your little keyboard, trying to be the grand arbitor of the lives of strangers. You are the embodiment of what's wrong with the Internet community.
I had much cruder language for you in my head. But, that would make me like you. And I do not want my wife to spend her remaining years with the likes of you.
You do you. And leave the rest of us alone.
Good day.

I'm in my upper 50s. I'm heavily invested in BTC and some ETH. 
So far, through various conversations, my 80yo father and 76yo aunt have joined me in the journey.
50+ year olds were born during the gold standard (US dollar tied to gold, foreign currencies pegged to the dollar.) Many are not aware that things changed a long time ago.
This same demographic has paid into Social Security their entire working lives, and are not aware, or willing to face, that SSN funds will be limited when it's their time to draw from it.
Discussing these two points, and describing Bitcoin in accounting (ledger) terms, rather than tangible (coins, gold) terms, helps get the point across.
I describe it as "buying shares of a global economic system" rather than owning "coins". They get that shares fluctuate in value, but generally grow. They also become more interested in economic systems around the world, and how it affects their status quo. And begin to think less of BTC as "magic Internet beans that will someday grow into a beanstalk to the heavens without their nurturing". And they may vote accordingly.

The most honest answer I can give is this... 
If $780 is honestly a lot of money for you then this is the wrong place to put it. 
When you have little or no debt, an emergency fund and money to burn, this is a great place to burn it. 
You'll either get a nice return or great stories.
