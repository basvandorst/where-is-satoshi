I thought of that and that's the closest you can come to it, but you get to spend Bitcoin in way more places than a company's gift card code.

Here is why, in marketing click through rate drops by as much as 30% each click. With Bitcoin they don't need to enter anything or signup, all of it is done in one page and the moment you guess the brainwallet that is your money.


Nope, because if you look at their page all the check marks beside the wallets are actual BTC wallets and their brainwallet are the clues in the video. So if you happen to guess one you have access to the money by definition.

The reason I bolded those two words (trustless and frictionless) is because they get thrown around all the time, but this is a clear example of Bitcoin bringing in these two qualities in field where neither existed before. Obviously I'm aware that they are popular BTC buzzwords.

I didn't say n00b, I'm very informed about BTC, just not active on reddit.

hahaha, I know this sounds like a shill post but here is what happened : I was looking to see how companies use BTC to do marketing went on Bitcointalk and browsed the Games and rounds section and this thread was at the top [
I have been lurking reddit for years never had the urge to make an account, I just got so excited thinking about the possibilities in marketing with BTC that I had to do something to share the excitement, hence the post.
