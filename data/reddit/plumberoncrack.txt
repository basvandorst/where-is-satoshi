You missed my point entirely.
My point is that when discussing the topics at hand, we should be mindful of the difference between opinions and fact.

The unfortunate truth of the matter is that you are not entitled to a thing (apart from your own opinion), despite your "standing with core".  Having faith in something does not grant you any special privilege.

You are responding to a well-thought out post with a sarcastic meme which misses the entire point of the post (which is to say: the post says "yep, high fees suck, but we have to be patient and fix the problems carefully")
If you want your perspective to be taken seriously, then sit down, think about it, and write a rebuttal.  Then we can all learn a little more and have civilized discussion about the problem.

That is similar to the answer I got when I recently asked about what the Lightning Network will look like.  The best answer I got was "we don't know how it will end up being used".  I had to sit and think about that for a while before I realized what they were really saying.
All the developers can do is create the technology, after that, it's up to the million-monkeys to poke it and prod it and see what can be done with it. The first caveman to carve out a wheel had no idea it would one day be used to maneuver a satellite so it could take a picture of far-away stars. 
All of that is to say: this whole thing is a discovery process, and it's interesting as hell.

OK, I think you understood my question.  And I definitely never had the idea of a bank node.  I gotta wrap my head around this... 
So let's say I join BitBank1's channel...  I want to buy coffee from a store that is on LightningService1's channel, and then I splurge on a new video card from Microcenter, who use LightningCorp1.  What you're saying is I don't have to screw around with the other channels, BitBank1 can transact with the other channels for me?

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:32:57
OK, so let's go with that example.  If I'm buying coffee from a shop that I'll never interact with again, but my buddy uses all the time, what will that look like to me?  Will I need to do anything to join that channel?
And what advantage does keeping the channel open have for me?
All genuine questions.  I just want to understand it better.

 It's great to have something you believe in, especially a positive message like this.  The fact that you recognize it's emotional for you is also good.  In spite of my joke about the dark side, it's perfectly natural to be emotional about something like Bitcoin, but that makes intellectual honesty that much more important. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:44
Are you a fucking idiot?  I'm not interested in discussing the merits or demerits of LN with you in this thread.  How is that not clear to you?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:27:36
I like the cut of your jib.

Copied from another reply:
Maybe too deep into the rabbit hole on this question, but how would this work on the backend? I think I'm missing a step here, maybe that's where I'm failing. I understand the concept of spending on one channel and settling, but I don't think I've come across the idea of channels being able to interact.
In the example provided, wouldn't Amazon have to be on the same channel as Starbucks? How does that interaction work? For clarification:
Channel A: Me and Starbucks
Channel B: Starbucks and LightningService 
Channel C: Amazon and LightningService
What transactions would take place? What happens when LightningService closes the channels each month?
Edit:  just realized that Starbucks and Amazon would probably be on the same LightningService channel, which would remove the need for 3 channels and just have 2.

I get no joy from the misfortune of others, but... geez, man.  I hope you learned your lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:21:58
That is one perfect application for the small channel use-case!

I see that your tongue is planted firmly in your cheek, but just to clarify: everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion!  It's just when it is presented as a foregone conclusion, things get murky. ;)

Insist on...?   How much are you paying the LN devs? Enough that you feel comfortable insisting on anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:48:39
Very cool!  Definitely interesting to see the big dogs floating around.  I wonder if we'll see as many once this whole thing calms down a little... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:33
This is pretty much exactly the point of this post... I know LN opens a whole new world of uses, and I'm really excited to see what happens next.  I'm having trouble figuring it out myself, but I have no doubt people a lot smarter than me are thinking deeply about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:08:57
I know, and I know this post likely won't change a thing about all that.  I just wanted to bitch a little bit ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:50:04
Did you even read the post?  I don't care whether it does or it doesn't.  I am saying that it's important to have intellectual honesty in discussion.  You categorically do not know if LN will or won't help.  If you have data to back up your opinion, then post that (elsewhere, in a thread dedicated to that discussion), and discuss it.  Stating an opinion as fact is less than worthless, it's poisonous.

Once again, trying to understand how this works with fees, etc..  So in this example, NYTimes would pay the fee to open a channel for 30 days.  Visitors would send a micropayment (plus small fee) through the network - via a path from whatever channel they are on, or join the NYTimes channel - then at the end of the month, NYTimes would pay the fee to close the channel and settle the Bitcoin balance.  So the only fee the user pays would be the one for a single transaction.
Am I getting this right?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:59:04
Can you back that up with some data?   /s
I think that's the one thing we can *all* agree on!

I couldn't agree more, and you make a good point about it becoming an emotional thing to people.  To some people, this is their shot at achieving their dreams, make it big, etc..  Of course, with that comes a lot of emotion and hope, and fear of loss.

Ignoring the pointless complaint about blocksize which is a separate discussion, I actually love the idea of it.  It's essentially digital fiat paper to bitcoin's gold.

Just to reassure you a little, things got a little crazy around the end of last year, and the price should never have hit those numbers.  It was a bit of a "fever" and got overbought, causing the price to increase way too high.  The current drop is just part of a correction, and is perfectly natural.
All my humble opinion:  Don't jump ship yet.  It's all OK.  The ship isn't going down.  The price will stabilize and grow again.  With new technologies like Lightning come new use-cases.  With new use-cases comes new users, which means prices rise.
tl;dr:  It shouldn't have reached the price it did, and this is a perfectly natural response.  Correction, meaning "to make something correct".

You'd have said the same thing on Dec 18th, 2013, when Bitcoin dipped to $430 from a high of $1140, lost over 60% of its value.  I'm sure I don't need to remind you of the current value.
Also, Bitcoin's value is much more than just the USD price.  Its value is growing constantly, especially with the recent advances in the efforts of the Lightning devs.

It's the truth, though.  Of course, this is strictly legally speaking.  There is no law that states that a Bitcoin exchange must be available for all transactions at all times.
Now, if Coinbase were using the ability to stop transactions when it is advantageous to them, it would be highly unethical, and it is certainly possible that this has happened previously.  The question is, how much do you trust them?
And as always:  DON'T STORE YOUR COINS ON AN EXCHANGE.

Oh, don't be so dramatic.  It's a bit of a red day, that's all.

Hey friend, you might want to relax a little.  A lot of people want to track their expenditures and income for any number of reasons, and an app could help with that.  I'm not here to make judgment, but your posts seem a little paranoid, and you might want to get that checked out, for your own good.  I love Bitcoin's goals of providing a fast and secure payment method, separate from the big banks, but I still want to pay taxes.  I dislike that those taxes partially go towards warmongering, but they also go towards infrastructure and assistance for those who need it.
