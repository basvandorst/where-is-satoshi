This comment is why there's also a chance that a major correction could be far in the future lol.

Yeah it’s always important to challenge your beliefs. Originally, I was pretty negative on bitcoin and thought other cryptos were a lot better. But after examining my complaints, I realize its problems would be true to any coin that was number 1. Because of this, I was able to acquire some before the beginning of its massive bull-run in November.

The current buy is largely supported by banks. Once futures hit, they can use their large supply of btc to hedge against their own bets. This will create large fluctuations in the bitcoin price. The initial reaction will be a large dip, followed by a swarm of normies buying up more. The fluctuations will get smaller in magnitude as we get through the first half of 2018. This is because cryptocurrency is already a cultural phenomenon and the current price mirrors this, as it does in all new technologies spreading. This means the prices will steadily increase while becoming more stable, just like during the beginning of mobile phones, or the internet. Once this happens more services adopting crypto will start to appear, starting with btc and eth and will see a massive boost once solutions to the congestion problem start appearing. Cryptocurrency isn't a bubble in the traditional sense, its a new tech being adopted.
btw I saw this in a dream.

Here comes all the sensationalism. 
Personally, I've always assumed that nothing I do online is private. I think wikileaks is making this a bigger deal than it is for their own aims. There is a lot of shit that happens behind doors at intelligence agencies that I think we just have to accept. 
In my opinion, these measures are tolerable if it's ultimately for the sake of US citizens. If these are used against us, I think only then it'd be cause for concern.
