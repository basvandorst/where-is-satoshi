This is what happens when taxes get too crazy high.

I interpret inflation to mean increasing prices and/or wages (which is just another price).
But by your definition, fractional reserve banking would also be inflation?
Also, I would note that people have not been deceptive since the 1980s.  Since the 1980s, we have seen episodes (Japan; and now US, Eurozone, *still* Japan) where increasing the amount of money in existence does not always increase prices.

But the deficit does not equal inflation.  I used to make that same mistake when I was a Ron Paul supporter.  The gov't can run deficits even when the Fed is shrinking the money supply.

I don't have any old dictionaries (a pity).  But I have an economics textbook from 1960 - I'll check in there later this week to see how it defines inflation.


I've read 1984, but I still think you're staking out a claim that stretches credulity.  


You've described positive deflation from enhanced productivity, and positive inflation from a supply shock.  And I mean positive/negative from the point-of-view of economic efficiency.  But a fixed money supply when both prices, wages, and overall nominal GDP are declining is a negative form of deflation that is a net negative to both lenders and creditors.  Hence, central banks should promise to maintain the money supply the market demands to continue regular trade and commerce.  Sometimes that means the money supply will grow.  Sometimes that means it shrinks.  That seems reasonable to me.

Income and payroll taxes are the largest source of revenue for the US Government.  The only way inflation provides solid returns to the government via tax revenue is through capital gains, and to a lesser extent interest income (if inflation was really high).  Capital gains and interest income taxation is a relatively small amount of government revenue.

Maybe we aren't using terms the same way.  How do you define inflation?
