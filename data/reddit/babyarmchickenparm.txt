Bitcoin by itself? probably not. It will probably be a store of value like gold. More like a crypto-asset. But other crypto currencies might help to do it one day. We are still early into this.

I see it says "redditor for 2 weeks" next your username and I totally believe it.
The meme is he somehow looks happy and sad at the same time

It was a 5 letters and 3 words. No special characters. I guess it was simple. Maybe really simple? how long is your coinbase PW supposed to be?
I thought I was safe with the 2 step verification.

1. Thanks, I am in contact with coinbase support now. They reversed the 1 BTC purchase and froze my coinbase account.
2. I found malware on my computer, I think it was a trojan. This is probably the culprit? The attacker must of had access to my email because an email was deleted. Why didn't they try changing all my passwords and locking me out?
I have since changed all my PW's, enabled 2-step verification for my email and deleted the malware.

Unfortunately I didn't have Authy on my phone when I tried to log into my coinbase account (I forgot I just restored my phone). So I didn't get a text but I did get an email from coinbase saying "This new computer is requesting access to your account:
Location: Colombia"(I live in the United States). However the email is gone/deleted from my  email account. I guess they had my email password?

I typed "coinbase" into google while incognito mode and clicked the first link. It looked like coinbase and pretty sure it had the secure lock icon thing at the top. Is it possible I could of went to fake page?

Ok thanks didn't realize I could do this. I just checked and someone logged in from Colombia 2 hours ago. I logged out of "all other sessions".

I have changed all my PWs and un-linked my bank account. Can I cancel the impending 1 BTC purchase in case they try and transfer that as well?

Ok it says "You haven't created any API keys yet." 
 I was logging in to buy bitcoin because the price was so low so it would be pretty funny.

I was using Authy for my coinbase account. I didn't have it for my email account but I just enabled it. 
I just removed my checking account info so they can't complete any more purchases....
EDIT: I guess my Coinbase password wasn't strong enough but I figured since I was using Authy it would be ok. 
I only had about $30 worth of BTC so I haven't been burned that bad so far

Nothing like a good derp-dive to really get you believing in the future of bitcoin
