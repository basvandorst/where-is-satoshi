I first got into Bitcoin using Bitquick, before the big banks started preventing people who were not account owners from depositing cash into other peoples' accounts. Solid service, never had a problem.

Nope, just had a secondary phone (a $10 prepaid phone) tied to my account in case I lost my primary phone. But it is a dick move to ask your customer that, without any prompting.

I can appreciate the skepticism. In this case I felt CB customer support really deserved to be publicly outed. See above for more details on the bug (it took them 2 days to realize that it was a bug).

I had bought them a week ago and they had just been delivered. I never leave any coin in there.

Agreed - the behavior after their recent growth is outrageous and unacceptable.

Yes it really irked me that it took me typing 10,000 words to explain the issue instead of just being able to call and tell someone.

If I logged into CB using 1 of my 2 2FA phone numbers, I could send transactions/change settings with that same number. Now, only an SMS is sent to the phone I use as a backup no matter what. There is no way to change settings, drop the phone I was using as backup, no way to create transactions, etc. CB CS basically told me to fuck off - they told me to reset authy and gave me links to their support page.

It's convenient and common to use Bitcoin if you're in the US. It's very cheap to use and has always been a solid service (until now, IMO). 
Exchanges require lots of ID or sometimes do not service US citizens at all. And wire transfers usually are expensive, my bank charges $90 for a wire transfer.

They are worse than a bank - at least the teller has never asked me if I use my cell phone for "illegal activity".

I've had both phones tied to my account since they started 2FA with no problems. This is a technical problem within Coinbase that just showed up.

I don't use the CB app, I just access the service through my browser to buy BTC then immediately transfer it to my Trezor. In this case I could login to buy BTC but I cannot send it out, due to a technical issue on CB's side. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:03:28
I'm with you - never had a problem until now (and this is a technical problem, nothing else). Never stored any funds on there thank God.

I made the post so others can benefit from my experience - other people have done the same over the years (especially on bitcointalk.org) and I've benefited greatly, so I now try to do the same anytime I have important information.
What you do with the information is up to you.

Yep, I use a Trezor and love it. I have been using Coinbase since they first started up, and had a few hiccups but nothing like this. From now on I guess it is bitquick.co for simple purchases (I'm in a small town and the only person using BTC so localBTC isn't an option).
