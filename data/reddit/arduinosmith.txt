I think I was in the first batch, only a month or so after they launched the campaign, that might have something to do with it. At the time I ordered, it was possible to order just one. Don't know how that is.

ROI AHOY!
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:08:43
Well I'm glad somebody's getting something out of this mess. Thanks for the tip! First time getting money from a stranger on the internet. You gave me more than my miner has earned me today (only had it running for a couple of hours) 
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:00:40
Could think on numerous locations to do this actually :D
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:57:55
How much would you pay for it?
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:21:33
Me: "Oh man, I'm gonna buy this machine for $330 thats gonna make me rich. By my estimations it's gonna make me $400-$600 dollars per month by the time it arrives. Boy, you've really done it this time. No more going to work early, no more spending hours trying to fix stuff that's not working - just buy new. When I'm rich, I hope my friends will still like me for other reasons than the money. Oh boy oh boy..."
It was the cheapest at the time being, they promised a pretty short delivery time. What can I say - I took the shot. It could've made me money, I could've lost money. For now it's just an experience. My overall dealings with BTC has been profitable for me (and I haven't done much trading or anything).
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:12:57
Sure, please do. Seems like that's a most likely possibility.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:55:18
Yes exactly! I really did like the design of the whole thing as well. I am looking into making some products myself, and I got some good inspiration from the casing. Don't worry - I'll never allow pre-order :D
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:09:12
Nah, I paid 18 months ago. It's a loss for past me - not present me
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:44:08
I'm quite sure refund is out of the picture from these scamming sons of bitches :(
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:53:35
I was thinking of mining primecoin actually. So that at least my power spillage does some good for science and cryptography. Are there any other coins like this?
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:52:28
Pretty good advice right there!
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:09:49
Yeah.. One can hope...
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:44:23
Haha, I like the spirit!
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:23:36
They would've been awesome. But too good to be true.
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:22:16
I feel for you :(
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:43:38
At the current difficulty, around 0.045 BTC per month
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:24:02
Well, they'll probably just start again with a new company name...
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:13:47
tbh, I probably dont want to carry it around for that long time. Future me is probably gonna hate me :(
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:55:47
Yep. It was when I ordered, though :(
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:45:13
And so what would you use it for?
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:04:49
Lucky mining! Fuck the lottery *this* is da real deal!
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:44:49
Definitely did think about this! It has an android for screen
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:01:42
BTC equivalent of $330, can't remember how much BTC it was though.
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:01:44
 that would be a huge success!
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:10:57
Black Arrow Software... 150 GH/s was quite the amount 18 months ago, mind you ;)
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:05:56
This seems like my best bet so far - do nothing
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:01:02
Nah, that would be overkill... Here's a [pic]( though. NSFW
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:10:37
Goddamnit. A few more arduino years and I'll be able to remodify the ASIC manually... 20'ish nm? No problem, just get the hammer and soldering iron!
