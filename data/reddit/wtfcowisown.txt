See As long as goods are legal to trade and import taxes are paid, there is no legal issue.  The issue is when people start marking packages as a "gift" to avoid import taxes.  This is against the law and should not be done.

Would you blindly give money to somebody based on reputation?  It's different with a store in real life, like Wal-Mart, because you could always go back to the store.  The store is a semi-permanent place (It'll be there for at least a few more months), while my sub could be closed down any second, my account deleted, etc.
Even though I have reputation, people are still wary.

Interesting how they do it, but I was looking for something a bit more personal.  A dedicated escrow service.  Is there anyway to create one?  Is there a process?  Or is it as simple as "Give me Bitcoin and I'll act as escrow?"
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:49:05
Purse.io shipped there
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:24:23
You are correct.  If electrum went down and you couldn't find a way to install it onto your PC you would lose your coins if you only had the seed.  You should have 2 flash drives to prevent this problem.  THIS IS THE REAL RISK TO EVERYBODY USING ELECTRUM OR ANY OTHER SEED-BASED/PASSPHRASE BASED WALLET.
1 for your electrum seed, and another for all your electrum private keys.
The drive wouldn't even need to be 1gb.  Just get 2 small drives and save them somewhere.
NOW DO IT AGAIN  This time in a safety deposit box, and another place where you can put it.
If you want even more security, you can encrypt the flash drives with bitlocker, and inside (after a full wipe) put your files into multiple zip files that ask questions only you would know.
(I do a similar setup) - open drive, put password for bitlocker, see zip file named (dob mm/dd/yyyy), where the answer to file would be your birth date.  Ask similar questions by layering zip files (always max encryption that is offered).  I personally do this to all of my drives.  This way it would be impossible for anybody to get my btc.  There would be backups everywhere.  
Now if you're super paranoid you can take it a step further.
MULTISIG ACTIVATION
If you have 10 drives total, make it so that you need 5 to access btc.  This way if you lose half of your drives you still have coins.  
People who store large amounts (1k+) do this setup.  It's cheap ($10-15 for drives) and really can't be tampered with (quantum computing might one day be able to do it) at least in our lifetimes.

Multisig flash drives I safety deposit boxes using electrum.  It's cheap and easy.
For extra security, put the seed into a password protected zip file (mac protection) and put the zip into cloud storage such as Google drive/dropbox.

Increasing scarcity in the coming supply of bitcoins.
Bitcoins are moved away from markets everyday.  People lose private keys, store them on cold wallets for years, and some people just hold onto bitcoins.  These coins will never reach the market and make existing coins more scarce, increasing value.
Having 25 bitcoins released to miners every 10 minutes counters this effect.  Coins are released into the market to counteract the effect above.  As less coins enter the market and more coins are taken away from markets scarcity will increase, further driving price.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe satoshi said something along the lines of, "Each Bitcoin lost makes the rest more valuable."  The halvening forces scarcity onto Bitcoin, which is why price is expected to increase dramatically.
In layman's terms, imagine if the United States had 10,000 money printing machines working at 100% capacity 24/7.  One day, 5,000 break and the blueprints are gone!  The US cannot make more printers.  The lower incoming supply of money maestro existing money more scarce, increasing value.
Do you remember history class?  Germany, after World War 1, had to print insanely large quantities of money In order to pay off war debts.  This caused hyperinflation causing their currency to become worthless.  It was cheaper to burn money than wood for a house fire!

Circle was definitely the best in the business.  Instant approval $300 limit for $300 instant buy with credit/debit.  They even let me use my paypal debit card!  $3000 weekly with standard bank transfer.  Low fees all around.  They even raised my credit/debit limit to $3000 weekly!

Coins are created and not encrypted properly.  Miners use computing power to give bank level encryption to the coins released in bunches by the bitcoin network, and as a reward get the coins.  There's software that automates this.
There's a lot of information missing, but without some reading up and a cup of coffee this is a good alternative.

It sucks but it's something we just have to accept.  I'm sure companies like venmo, PayPal, etc. want to accept btc and work with it, but government regulations and not having absolute control of funds makes it risky for them.

I think a better way of phrasing your question is "What exchange should I refer my customer to?  He lives in Canada and requires an on-exchange wallet and low fees."
