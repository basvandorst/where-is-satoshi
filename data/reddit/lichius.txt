More like his rich Chinese parents bought him it with money made from exploiting people/lack of labor laws. This is Vancouver, after all.

This is correct. Thanks.

Very, very well said. Difficult to stay level headed when this comes up when all I want to do is to be able to afford to live in the place I grew up in.

You're right, but if they run a legit business in China, why are they parking money in successful Western metropolises? Buying property like crazy and then not even renting it out. How about they just use their wealth to influence their own countries so they don't have to fuck up ours.

Buddy, I'm an Environmental Engineer and live in Vancouver. It's top 3 most diverse cities on the planet. (I know that's not what you meant.. couldn't help it tho).

I mean, it's great advice, don't get me wrong. I already followed all of it except 4. I drive a 1998 Subaru I paid 2k for. I got a big scholarship I didn't even apply for by getting Honors in my small hometown community college with a 2 year Technical Diploma that all together costed 16k including all expenses. Took 2.5 years, but got a good job in a decent career path. Student loan is 1/3 paid off and all I've done is pay the minimum of less than $200/month. Line of credit and CC debt is almost all gone. We are in the position of thinking about where we should be putting our money for the future. Is real estate viable for us at this point living in Vancouver? Should we go all in on mutual funds/investing? It's only been about 6 months since we starting making "holy shit we have thousands in the account after bills" money. I think we it's time we pay a professional to talk it over with. Lol sorry for the rant, and thanks for being a vessel for my self-reflection haha.

You had me until  The only place to make a decent living doing what I do in my province is a city that is the  most expensive places in my country and top 10-15 in the world. How does one save up 20% of a million dollars? OK, don't live in the city you say. 20% of 500,000 is still 100k. How in the world is anyone expected to save up that much money, while also lowering my standard of life by commuting for 2 hrs a day and then very rarely being able to make it into the city to party/socialize and not become depressed. It's insane. My partner and I recently started making a very respectable income, enough to afford rent downtown and be just fine. But saving even $50,000 in a reasonable amount of time seems so far away.

I have been using LibertyBit (Canadian) with absolutely no problems. Have transferred money by bank order and EMT and have gotten the money in my account within 24 hours. They've answered my questions and comments promptly and professionally. It has lower volume but I've noticed the volatility of the market is much less than CaVirtex or Mt.Gox. They have 2 step Google authenticating though Im probably not the one to talk to about security.
