It's a bit misleading. He's actually showing off the camera he took the picture with.

I had a dream that the price went to zero, but then it went right back up and way higher than it started because everyone was buying the dip.

So did he hide the keys or did he give it all back? It'll be worth way more when he gets out of prison when he's 30. Totally worth the time investment.

Western Union delivered that letter Doc wrote in 1885 to Marty in 1955 at the exact right time. Don't underestimate them.

Also proof of work is not there to create scarcity, it's needed to keep the network going, the reward is there to motivate miners to do so. It's also a good method of initial distribution.

Just google intrinsic value. That's the way it's used. Example: [ this kind of gets complicated about it but it's the same basic idea.
I'm not trying to make this a competition. I'd be happy to admit being wrong about something if provided the evidence, that's how you can learn something new or unlearn something wrong or get to think about it in a different way when discussing something.

Sure 1a there fits. See also  which is basically the same but worded differently. I was talking about intrinsic value meaning the basic characteristics that make a currency useful to people versus value that is assigned to it from the outside. 
If someone found value in wiping their ass with dollar bills I wouldn't say that value was intrinsic to the currency.
If they found it useful to burn the money to stay warm I would say that is intrinsic to the material the cash is made with but not the currency.
Profiting off a currency as an investment is not intrinsic to the fact of what gives a currency value. A currency would ideally never change in price. A chair should always be worth the same amount of currency and should not ever change in price because of the currency but only because the price of the chair itself changed.
 Volatility adds risk and is merely mechanism for shifting wealth around from those that earned it to those that are lucky or in control (also the government that taxes it). That differs from the fundamental reason we have a currency and can drastically reduce that intrinsic value it has as a currency. Money getting sucked away by those that didn't earn it damages the economy.

Well my answer is that I believe so. There are cryptocurrencies that work, are faster and don't depend on proof of work. Nano is a pure currency that does it very well and has a great development team. Skycoin is way beyond a currency and calls itself Blockchain 3.0 Bitcoin being 1.0 and Eth being 2.0. Do some research on those. Listen to talks by Synth (guy behind Skycoin) on youtube, very interesting. Then make your own decision.
Edit: not trying "sell shitcoins", I don't get anything for talking about it. If someone provides a valid reason why some better or worse I'd easily change my mind and it's easy to move money to another currency if i believe it's the way to go so I'm not personally invested in that way.

You will probably get downvoted for posting this here regardless of the truth or at the very least the opinion will be biased towards Bitcoin. Try asking on r/CryptoCurrency you will get a better variety of responses.

Yes that's what I mean. If the overhead is necessary to get the desired result because you don't know a better way to do it then that is a good value for those that need or want the end product enough to put up with the cost.

I didn't ignore it, this was just the second comment.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:52:14
Probably unpopular opinion here but:
Proof of work is a flawed system due to the overhead, also the idea that goes around about how the work put into creating the coin gives it intrinsic value is completely false and violates the natural laws of exchange. Less overhead = more value &amp; more usability = more value. 
There are already much better consensus systems such as Obelisk for Skycoin as well as whatever Nano uses, they are fast, don't require proof of work and are better for decentralization.

What about water? It has a high value to all living things that want to continue living. I'd call that intrinsic value. Price is a separate thing which is determined by supply and demand. Despite the high value of water, price is very low thanks to the high supply in 1st world countries. However if price were really high people would still pay for it if they couldn't get it else where.
Currency has value depending on how well it serves as a replacement or in between point for goods and services. That intrinsic value is based on it's speed, it's price stability, how low the fees are, its security, its freedom of use, its popularity (who will accept it) and ease of use. Price is arbitrary and has nothing to do with it (unless it's volatile), if the price is higher you can just buy less of it and exchange it for the same goods or services regardless.

The more valuable watch has something extra that people need or want, it's not overhead if it's something that's useful or perceived as valuable by the market.
Proof of work creates overhead that is not valuable. People using the currency are not happy about having to pay a fee or about having to wait hours for the transaction to clear, or about mining centralization and the waste of resources. It's only valuable to a few who profit from it, not the majority. It is still better than fiat and banks though, but now there are more practical technologies that should be supported by those that actually care for real progress and are not one of the few that are benefitting for some other reason.

I found it amusing despite having seen the movie many times and knowing the truth. That's what makes it funny. 
I'd argue that people who haven't seen the movie would be less likely to find it funny because they have no idea what it's referencing.
