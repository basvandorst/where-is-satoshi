Well if you want an example, check out Pigzbe on Kickstarter. (Their campaign is over, and this is not an advertisement)
They were reporting that they'd be shipping the device this summer, it is a wallet designed for kids which is controlled via an app for the parents. Turns out they won't be shipping in some locations til end of year, because they didn't realize how complicated the AML/KYC requirements on them will be. This is not even a trading platform, as far as I know it is for savings only, and their token can't be transmitted from the device, only deposited and withdrawn through the app, in the form of their own token which is on StellarX.
They also announced that in order to have a functioning business, which performs the KYC/AML and maintenance of the app, they will need to charge a monthly fee for users (which was never part of the pitch)
They are honoring their commitments to Kickstarter customers afaik, who won't be required to pay monthly to use the devices, and will still hopefully ship soon, but this business is much more complicated than it looks to an outsider; it would be much easier legally speaking to make one for yourself only, or do it in a way that doesn't result in you playing any part in day-to-day operations of the users of the devices, like the firefly thing. It's not clear what Pigzbe did that put them "over the line" but if your product resembles the Pigzbe platform it's safe to say you will bump into the same issues they did.
Another good example that didn't get off the ground (but made a functioning product and open-sourced their designs) was the Firefly wallet, based on Ethereum

Then, go make cool stuff! :thumbsup:

Making one might not make you a money transmitter, but I'm pretty sure that installing it somewhere that people can use it (and funding it) would definitely mean you are a money transmitter.
The person who posted this is also in Portugal, according to the linked crowdfunding page, so that's probably what was intended, "(I'm) Not in the US"
You weren't really going to trust the word of some armchair internet lawyers though, were you?
