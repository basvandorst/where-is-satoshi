I can move any amount of money from Wells Fargo to Fidelity to Vanguard to Morgan Stanley to City Bank to any other financial instution for free.
Having to pay money to transfer money seems really unusual to me.

If you're in your 20s don't feel bad. If you save and keep working on your future you'll get there.

I've transfered more than $500,000 a few times. Every time its been free (usually they pay me interest actually). The more you transfer the happier most financial instutions are and the more likely you are to get special treatment.

Bitcoin exchanges are very difficult to trace. As long as that is true it will have utility for tax free wealth storage and illegal transactions.
No other currency offers that or stock offers that. Its not going away.

Think of it like gold. Its valuable because its valuable and impossible to make money. The word currency is misleading as its not popular because of its utility as a medium of exchange. The main appeal, like gold, is that it is a medium to store wealth.
