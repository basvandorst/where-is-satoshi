To point out the obvious, “fiat” currencies backed by stable governments have an inherent value: you can pay taxes in them, and in so doing avoid prison. You can’t pay taxes in gold, Pokémon cards, or btc without first converting them to dollars/euros/whatever. 
Btc’s an _asset_, not a currency. It’s actually quite far off from being a currency: 
- It’s too volatile to be a store of value
- Few merchants will accept it, making it a poor medium of exchange. 
- Virtually nothing is priced directly in btc, but rather in USD/EUR/etc.

Suppose you know that in one year, everything will cost 20% more than it currently does. This is inflation. At the margin, it provides an incentive to purchase goods now rather than wait. 
Now suppose the opposite: instead of expecting prices to rise, you expect them to fall. That’s deflation. In this case, you’re better off delaying purchases because, in the future, your current dollars will buy more actual goods. 
Now suppose that _everyone_ has deflationary expectations, and this everyone’s putting off purchases. Aggregate demand drops, which also leads to drops in supply — layoffs, furloughs, etc. That’s obviously a very bad scenario: with layoffs comes even less demand and more risk aversion. Less investment, less incentive to start firms. That’s a deflationary spiral. 
Inflationary monetary policy exists, partly, to prevent that spiral. 
tl;dr yes — when prices drop, an individual dollar buys more actual stuff, and is thus more valuable.

I know everyone here hates banks, but when I deposit to my checking account, I can actually withdraw the money.
