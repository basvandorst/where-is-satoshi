I just had issues recently. Took more than 6 weeks to resolved the issue, it is indeed problematic.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:35:59
Just wondering... what's the chances of other alt-coin's miners switching to bitcoin if the HF occur. Trying to game theorize possible scenarios
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:00:33
Well... then again "think" is an understatement when I'm visiting weibo, github, r/btc etc. to understand the full scale of the debate and potential actions (BU's replay protection / BC's potential HF or inaction post HF outcome etc.). 
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:57:42
Just briefly re-looked at their website since their wallet days and yes it seems like Xapo. I used to hear some negative feedback about them
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:54:00
Ah... got it.
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:29:50
Do you know why they stop offering it? Seems like a really useful feature
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:15:50
Anyway I mentioned in another comment that perhaps the main issue for me is that it is political and not technical in nature regarding this scaling debate.
BU wanting to elect a president for Bitcoin is enough to sum up what I need to know.
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:50:41
Roughly how rich is Roger Ver though in dollars or bitcoin? Just wondering.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:47:20
The issue is with node centralisation. Big blocks make it more expensive for an independent party to run their own nodes to validate transaction.
It is not about miners having better hardware but would you get into Bitcoin if it was 'issued / validated' by a centralised entity?
 Decentralisation is one of the key properties of Bitcoin that makes it attractive for me.
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:56:17
Maybe care to elaborate where I got wrong? 
@_date: 2016-06-07 02:20:38

@_date: 2017-08-20 12:45:30
I imagine you have good intentions but what you posted indicates that big block are okay which they are not. While hardware improves, communication speed / propagation is already at its limit (speed of light). 
You may want to research more since this is pretty misleading and lead to the wrong conclusion.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:06:27
What you are saying is actually not wrong.
If I understand correctly though, it is that decentralised nodes would reduce the ability of larger miners to have an advantage in mining leading to even more centralisation. I'm not 100% sure on this and someone else may be better suited to fill in the gaps.
However I do think that bigger blocks will definitely be needed. In the current Segwit2X case, it is more political than technical in nature. Just the notion that BU ( or whatever permutation it is now ) is planning to elect a president for Bitcoin is a paradox if one follows through with the original vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:48:20
If you need to pay for coffee, there's this thing call cash. You pay $0 fee.
Bitcoin is not solely about paying for stuff. Bitcoin is meant to be an escape from problems with the current banking sector.
In case you miss the message on the genesis block:
"03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:51:01
Development takes time. In case u miss it, re-read the message on the genesis block. Using bitcoin to pay for stuff will come but there are more important to resolve. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:13:52
Click it and waste their money.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:21:32
Well... I mention propagation along with speed of light. Sending more packets doesn't resolve this issue, if by ur theory then the capacity is unlimited.
I know I shouldn't even bother to try having a rational debate considering your nickname.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:35:00
More details on the project? As to how it works in general?
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:25:31
Yeah. I think I didn't phrase it well. As in deflation leads to hoarding which eventually leads to inequality and monopoly. Anyway I think this is too huge a topic to discuss in the comments.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:10:14
Lol... maybe we can setup a company cuz that's what I'm thinking too. 
*Just kidding NSA if you're watching this. If you're not watching then I'm not kidding. :D
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:59:43
Sounds suspicious when you start being so hostile. u/gonzobon is just asking typical proof that's SOP in r/bitcoin. Not saying that you are a liar but evidence will definitely make your statement more reliable.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:18:16
I suppose it's better than Mt Gox. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:37:38
I have an angle (which I shall not elaborate due to "tl;dr" and a lack of time to type) that eventually Bitcoin would be like how the art world is right now where it (Bitcoin/Arts) acts as a storage for wealth for high network individuals and institutions.
That will ideally happen when chain interoperability between blockchains is already widespread. That will allow day-to-day transactions to still take place without stagnation on the Bitcoin blockchain due to too many HOLDER and not enough transactions to keep miners securing the chain.
What's your take on this?
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:04:37
Even if the difficulty adjustment is ignored and will need time to readjust, it still doesnt affect the "buy" side. 
It'll be the best democratic mechanism for users to vote with their money on which chain they want to follow.
@_date: 2017-04-16 14:44:52
I wonder if they are just buying time to wait till RootStock is ready. I don't really believe that BitMain is that irrational. Who knows though...
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:36:16
I don't think it is a matter of being bogged down but Bitcoin's positioning is very different compared to Ethereum (not that it is bad). 
"We should have patience. Bitcoin is a system that should last for all
ages and power mankind for a long time-- ten years from now a couple years of dispute will seem like nothing. But the reputation we earn for stability and integrity, for being a system of money people can count on will mean everything."
This is the essence of bitcoin. Yes price increases are awesome but stability is the key.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:50:08
Based on your knowledge, how do you see the end game for bitcoin in 5, 10 &amp; 20 years time? 
If you have the time to theorize. :)
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:29:46
How was proof of solvency or reserve usually done? Signed by the addresses holding their bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:06:35
... That doesn't give a fuck ...
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:18:17
From a functional POV, do you see a smart contract settlement mechanism to ever work on the bitcoin blockchain? (if this question even makes sense)
I have the same unanswered query you mentioned but at the same time the notion of what Ethereum is trying to accomplish is exciting.
To answer my own question based on my technical knowledge, it would be yes but only to a certain extent.
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:01:23
"I was here first. It's mine!"
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:36:49
I think the incentives now indeed is much stronger for other miners to switch to segwit. If segwit is activated, majority of antminers which is probably on antpool would have their advantage disappeared.
Are there enough non-antminers miners to incentivize reaching the required activation threshold for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:47:24
Thanks a lot for this. Contains some economics tidbits that I didn't know about :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:59:05
This would totally eliminate my worry of them attacking the core chain if ever a HF were to happen. The worst is over for now.
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:07:14
Based on my understanding if a UASF takes place, the difficulty rate could be adjusted accordingly as well.
In terms of "buying", that shouldn't present an issue since transaction volume resides within the exchange and nothing is "transacted" on the blockchain until it is withdrawn. There might be issues on the "sell" side ( Selling bitcoin to fiat ) but there is no issue on the "buy" side ( Buying bitcoin to fiat ). 
This temporary imbalance would skew and fucked over the "less believed" chain since users get to vote with their money and rational miners would mine the chain users are willing to pay more for.
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:38:42
Crowd-sourced insurance for exchange.
Stakers would place funds in return for insurance on the exchanges, if nothing happens they get a cut of the exchange's profit.
If exchange gets hacked then their funds would be confiscated and this could be governed using smart contracts &amp; oracles
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:54:41
I'm not neutral towards litecoin and Charlie Lee don't seem like a con artist so just wondering what's your take on it being worthless? 
Sure. Not much is being done on litecoin but it's still being treated as a commodity and has transactional use case that might make sense as a cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:48:15
Don't know if it's just me but calling himself "World's first Bitcoin Investor" just sounds like a loser.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:19:09
I'm just wondering after reading this. Does anyone have the monetary background on the economic reasoning for the US leaving the Gold Standard? 
I understand that financially the Gold Standard was removed because USD holder were redeeming gold faster than the US can give out but it seems that deflationary "backed currency" has its own issue as well.
I suppose humans will always be on the flux in between inflationary &amp; deflationary currencies? 
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:45:59
Not really. That's how leverage works on exchange. I can get into the details but I'm not going to. It's the same thing with how the stock market and commodity works with futures, derivatives etc.
While I understand what u are saying, I think it's best to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:15:15
I think you guys couldn't have handled it better in that scenario. Just try to avoid getting hacked again yeah?
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:01:38
Yeah I suppose there's no foolproof solution. The only incentives I can imagine is that it makes more sense for the exchange to earn from fees than from a fake hack.
Fake hacking = lower user in the long run, damaged reputation, lower profits &amp; coins that can't be cashed out into fiat
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:33:14
Yeah I believe the nothing at stake issue is a tricky one. I'm particularly curious how they intend to tackle PoS + sharding since either one is complex enough.


PoW give assurance of a single source of truth "most of the time". PoS tries to do that through social consensus which is fine if that's the trade-off.
However with that trade-off, the consensus structure will be guided / governed through politics. If majority of validators are benevolent, everything will be good and rosy. That is a tricky thing to rely on though.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:43:58
I agree as well. :) Both has its flaws unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:09:23
This guy fucks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:22:50
That's the best way in my opinion too. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:16:17
How dare you doubt Roger Ver, the most prolific Bitcoin investor the world has ever seen aka the world first bitcoin investor. /s
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:56:17
Recently just had an international wire rejected for unknown reasons. Worst thing is I can't get any response from the corresponding bank + got fees deducted.
Total joke.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:16:15
Then it shouldn't matter. Bitcoin is a way to escape an inflationary fiat system while allowing the unbankable to have a low-overhead way of storing their wealth + other features.
Price matters but it shouldn't. Especially not when it comes to blaming developers who are contributing their effort doing what they believe in.
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:57:56
Care to elaborate how it works in detail?
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:26:30
My bank is actually fine and refunded me the fees. But the exchange's bank is un-contactable, not sure if i can get back the fees incurred. If not that the end of the relationship @_date: 2017-05-23 13:58:49
Collect them all like pokemon? all 21 million of them. :D
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:45:52
Where's the best place to view the current BIP148 nodes adoption?
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:08:47
The split is on the cutover day right? Not on 1st August yeah?
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:57:04
They are an exchange after all. It's not unlikely to use it as collaterals for traders to trade.
Not that I trust or know them and that's the bigger issue
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:39:40
Lol... okay this is funny. Came back especially to give it a thumbs up.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:05:54
You have the right to your opinions no doubt but who's to say who is right and who is wrong. There might be someone else out there that's adamantly sure that splitting bitcoin is the wrong thing to do.
If you are so convinced that you are right, do something about it. Learn to code, rally the community, UASF based on your commits. It's easier to criticize the devs but they don't owe you shit. 
Just because you bought bitcoins doesn't mean you own them.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:56:31
So it could just be a coincidence that a cold wallet unrelated to btc-e is transferring funds at the btc-e is down right? Just thinking out possible scenarios 
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:39:03
Install Segwit2X? You mean mining or hosting a node for Segwit2X?
Hm... my understanding is quite different from what you mention. Not saying you are wrong but the losing of hash rate don't sound quite right. The whole point of Segwit2X is to ensure that there's no chain split so I got a feeling you got it wrong. ( I might be the one that's wrong. )
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:12:12
So for the upcoming 1st august timeline, Segwit2X only activates segwit BIP 9 and nothing else right? The Segwit2X HF is few months down the road and even if the HF happens, the users can still stay on the current chain and ignore them?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:55:27
Kicks u/sroose off the bridge. :D
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:00:43
Could just be roger ver trying to get rid of his BTC for more BCC. :P
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:27:54
This is interesting. Unfortunately it probably can't be used for transfer with crypto exchanges since the bank accounts are different and wouldn't pass KYC/AML.
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:37:02
While I personally hope that BIP 148 would get majority support. It does seems like Segwit2X have more miner support at the moment.
It would still be fine if segwit is activated by Segwit2X or is there a down side to it? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:52:39
Maybe I term it incorrectly in the title but control access to bitcoin core's GitHub? Just concerned that with Segwit2X, bitcoin core developer's commit would be ignored and not merged.
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:03:44
Is Blockstream all on the same page for BIP148? I remembered reading u/nullc mentioned that he is against a contentious UASF.
Or maybe I remember wrongly.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:26:22
I feel the same way as you. As a rational actor, his best move is actually to do nothing even if he really want bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:23:22
How to tell if it sent to a mixer? I suppose the mixer's address is known?
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:46:05


Just by saying this alone proves you don't get bitcoin. If you want to get rich quick then bitcoin is not for you.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:39:44
Thanks for this. Haven't got time to do some blockchain analysis but I suppose the address stated is confirmed to be from btc-e?
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:38:04
Cool. That's more reassuring. Thanks for the hard work though. Personally I wouldn't support the Segwit2X HF down the road. :)
@_date: 2017-07-07 11:52:01
Can't be sure if im right but if Segwit2X is activated before 1st August then i presume that technically the chain would be a Segwit2X chain? Or does it just activate characteristics of Segwit while allowing a HF to happen down the road? 
I mostly get it but there's some "missing pieces to the puzzle" that I can't wrap my head around.
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:04:57
I'm just wondering if Schnorr signatures are compatible with current multisig setup? I imagine it should be. Correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:13:24
Okay... when you put it this way then it clears things up. :)
That's actually an okay scenario. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:48:23
This is the correct comment
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:11:06
Multisignature addresses have higher transaction fees right? Not sure if I remembered correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:28:32
I suppose there would be a coordination problem.
If I'm one of the group of miners, I can just betray the rest by using their strategy against them and I'm sure each of them have the same thought on their mind.
