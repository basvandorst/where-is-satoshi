Yea maybe I worded it wrong. Have to be more careful around people who take things word for word. A savings account will most likely not yield the same gains as investing in crypto. In a traditional since it wouldnt be a "savings account". But you can still treat it as such.

i'm around the same age, i just have my account auto purchase $20 worth of bitcoin every month. its nothing more than a savings account on steroids for me that may or may not increase in value.

For a lot of people bitcoin is an unhealthy obsession. Reminds me of this one guy who was obsessed with roulette. He was sure he had a foolproof winning strategy. After a while he started justifying his losses and didn't know when to stop.

Im with you 100&amp; Most people barely have 1k in their savings anyway on average. Having 1k in crypto wouldnt be the end of the world. But id rather someone treat it as a savings account than a real "investment". Usually people put money aside for a rainy day. Thats how im approaching crypto. Nothing serious.

Feel bad for the people who got in at 20k thinking it would keep going up.

Reminds of when binary options were hot. A lot of brokers never let you withdraw. This is what happens when it is not really regulated properly. If your letting a company in another country handle your funds be very wary. Hard to track down a company that is out of the US's jurisdiction.

100k? LOL

Do these ICO's even provide any real world value? lol. I never understood that concept. Or is the value in other people buying the currency?

That's what I figured. People getting finessed.

Makes sense. I mean if there is a new technology attached to it then "I get it". But most of these seem like people in their basement creating an ICO just for the sake of it. Most of these seem valueless.

Fucking genius. This will be the future. I actually thought QR codes were useless but they are making a comeback.
