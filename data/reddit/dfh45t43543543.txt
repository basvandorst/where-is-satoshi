I guess if you had some reputation as a good seller that would help.. maybe discount it a bit to motivate someone to take the risk.

The use of NFC will be with merchant terminals at businesses.. these terminals will be connected to a central payment proccessor that maintains lots of connections to p2p nodes - and as I alluded too, will probably also maintain direct connections to all the main mining pools - possibly with some kindof SLA agreements negotiated with them in order to ensure that any transactions they send are prioritized and not double spent.

Broadcasting the transactions is mainly done to avoid the extra QR scanning step that would otherwise be necessary. 
Once everyone switches to NFC instead the transactions will be sent directly to the merchant.. that way they get them instantly and it will still work if the phone doesn't have internet access. Also the merchant could possibly contract with all the main mining pools (or do so via a payment network cartel) and get their agreement that they will process this version of the transaction instead of any future double spend attempts.

bitstamp has said they'll stop accepting trades from non-verified users from end of this month.. how many users will verify? It's likely to restrict their volume in the short term anyway.

Marry a rich man/woman then get their money and convert it into bitcoin.
