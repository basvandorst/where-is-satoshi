Additionally, we’re introducing changes to withdrawal fees for both fiat and crypto. 
Currently, we are one of the rare exchanges that offer free crypto withdrawals. We were happy to provide this service as a way to foster crypto adoption for many years, but due to growing demand for crypto transfers from customers, it was no longer viable. 
1.	Crypto withdrawals
The new crypto withdrawal fees will be as follows:
•	Bitcoin: 0.0005 BTC
•	Ethereum: 0.001 ETH
•	XRP: 0.02 XRP
•	Bitcoin Cash: 0.0001 BCH
•	Litecoin: 0.001 LTC
