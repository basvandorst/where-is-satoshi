thanks this was good info, I've been investing since BTC was at 2600 and held it in an exchange and watched it fluctuate. I use exodus as my wallet and ill move my assets there. so really the only reason I would use an exchange is to buy and sell bitcoin. could I sell btc directly to someone looking to buy through the wallet code ? that way I can avoid fees. or just do it through the exchange and except the feeds and stay secured. 
thanks for the reply.

I thought it wasn't safe to keep your BTC in an exchange ? 
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:10:27

lets say you wanted to convert this to cash. how would you go about doing that? where do you sell ?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:54:43
oh I thought there would be like a formula or something to calculate future prices (with harder numbers).
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:55:22
