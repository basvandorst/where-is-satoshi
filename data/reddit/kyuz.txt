Out of curiosity, what regulations are you referring to that would make you opt not to participate in an exchange? I mean, in the US at least, Bitcoin exchanges are already regulated to some extent by FINCEN.

Use the latest Mycelium, it makes the whole backup-to-paper or backup-to-dropbox procedure effortless.

If nothing else it's just a really bizarre anecdote related by a person with bizarre thought processes.


No, no, no.
"Not good at managing companies" would be if he said, "At the time I thought I should have been coding and not in meetings, one of the many artifacts of my inexperience that caused me to make mistakes. Of course, since I have at least a very slight attachment to reality, in hindsight I can tell that my expectations for what the CEO of a financial services company should be doing were grossly incorrect."
What you're seeing here is delusion, pure and simple. 


Look, I don't know whether he could actually be diagnosed under the DSM-V or not. The "pathological" stuff is mostly tongue-in-cheek. But you lost me at the "normal guy" part. Whatever else he is, he's clearly far from normal.

That's so cute.

The passphrase is generated for you, you don't enter it, and you can send the file to your e-mail instead.
The problem with your method is that generating a paper wallet *securely* is very, very difficult, if you actually want to be protected from viruses/trojans.

I understood your intent, but I suspect the people in question may not be capable of tolerance. Maybe someday they will have experiences which will change them, or maybe not, but in the meantime I agree with you that they're holding Bitcoin back.

In that case it seems like you've already lost, since all exchanges are mandated to collect that information and it's highly unlikely they ever won't be.

This interview is notable in terms of how bizarre/idiotic every single thing he says is. At this point I can't help but conclude Karpeles is really mentally disturbed. I mean, how else could a seemingly intelligent person still not understand that people expect him to act at least slightly contrite about "losing" all their money? Has he ever made one public statement without this whining attitude?


Karpeles logic: people in Japan treated him well, so when he found a wallet, he returned it. Because, you know, that's not something you would do under normal circumstances. "Hey guys, I returned a wallet, see what a good person I am?" -- isn't this just a tacit admission he thinks like a thief?


Yes, a CEO needs to be spending his  time coding, not in meetings. Hallmark of a strong company, there. This is seriously how Karpeles thinks, folks! Is this not pathological?


Jesus Christ. Where's the money, Lebowski?!? Can we please get this guy the psychological therapy he needs and never ever interview/talk about him again?

This thread makes me sad because I see a lot of reasons why Bitcoin may never go mainstream, to wit, many people who are so obsessed with their ideology that they won't even consider not proselytizing it to those who hold different opinions, even at the cost of alienating those people and losing what they wish to  accomplish in the first place.

Interesting...what did you find difficult about it? All I did was start Mycelium and follow the prompts. Had it send the .pdf file to my dropbox account with one tap, then wrote down the passcode and stored it somewhere safe.

If one of your two choices involves Karpeles being an idiot, put your money on that one.

This would be a killer viral ad for bitmillions.com.

Seems clear he was lying to attempt to cover his trail, as well as making a bit of a joke based on the Princess Bride reference.
The way he was caught was that someone made the initial posts to bitcoin/drug forums advertising SR when it first appeared. Then 8 months later he posted using the same account, asking for an IT pro in the bitcoin community to help with a startup, and gave his real gmail address with his real name for people to contact him. Once they had his identity, they started watching him and the rest of it fell into place.

Tor's statement on Silk Road:

The thing that I wonder about is that from reading the report, it sounded as if the feds had located and taken (clandestine) control over the main SR web server months before they identified Ulbricht. Now, it doesn't say one way or another whether this was the case, but their actions seem consistent with it, to wit:
1) Discussing how they traced an IP from a commented-out configuration file to a VPN connection which was eventually traced back to a net cafe in San Francisco. If they already knew who Ulbricht was when they had control of the server then this would be pointless.
2) Likewise, finding an entry in the public ssh key file linked to "frosty which they correlated to the username Ulbricht used on StackOverflow. Again, if they had found the SR IP by monitoring Ulbricht, it wouldn't matter to them that they had found evidence he had ssh'd into the machine, they would have already linked him definitively to it.
What this means (if I'm correct) is that the FBI first located the IP of the SR server, which allowed them to get root access from their ISP. Rather than take it down, they monitored it for some period of time trying to figure out the identity of the person running it without tipping them off. However, Ulbricht had already stopped using his VPN by then and had switched to only accessing the server through Tor, which meant they weren't able to find him that way. Eventually, they discovered the link on shroomery/bitcointalk, and that was that.
So given this, it's natural for people to be suspicious that a weakness in Tor is what gave the FBI the SR IP. But to my knowledge, I don't believe Tor was the weak link in this case. More likely the FBI got access to one of Ulbricht's associates who had access to the server and got the IP from them.
