The risk profile is much different for a BTM operator compared to Coinbase. As such the requirements are typically less strict; as the chance of shady business happening at a BTM is lower than someone trying something with Coinbase.

Operators that run out of coin are typically running an ATM on the side, not as a full-time job. If you see an ATM that is part of a larger network it will almost assuredly never be out of coin. If in doubt check reviews on CoinATMRadar.
There is a fee for the convenience and privacy of using ATMs, that is true. However I think many will find it worth it, such as OP who prefers to not deposit cash into his bank account.

BTMs are instant, limits are typically higher and they accept cash, no bank accounts required. 
Additionally if you wish to remain more private most operators don't require ID, at least for small purchases.
