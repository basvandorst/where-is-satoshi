Actually not an OP's point.
Conclude his mention 1st  it's technically inferior BCH,
2nd It's dirty(as always when miner moaning for more blocksize, fork).
But as I was asking, I don't see any proof that we need more blocksize yet (for now).

Why do we need 8mb block, Just curious.
Even BCH has blocksize smaller than BTC now.
Or if this chart wrong?

Almost yes, But seem like only you who care? can't ignore some user who act like this. and it big issues for you so not giving up your bias and thinking it scam?

So your argument "a) have never once used Spanish" is wrong?

Because I want to, That's all.
And I like to keep low profile, found reddit longer than that but decided to sign up just 1 year and half ago maybe.
You may think this is an alt account use to help argue for main account. Surely you can.
But form my point of view Venezuela doesn't have much freedom or right this time (result can see in economy collapse). If you were in that position you won't get in spot light.
And for me my politic not as bad as there, I'm just introvert.
