Lol at people who think “news” is a cause for price action.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:55:39
Just say to yourself, “If this thing really fell back to $1,600 in the next 10 years, what would I do?”
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:10:39
Also, if you’re new to trading (via BTC) then you have not seen anything like the short selling that will occur on the Futures.

Sure can you provide me with crypto FA metrics?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:49:58
Actually futures market started for price discovery. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:01:23
Well that an interesting comparison... except WS would be the gun and you would be the dull knife. Moron. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:20:22
How did you get the USD on to the private key? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:54
Lol flounder 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:22:57
So you’re saying there need to be improvements? Yes I agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:21
News flash: Crypto is not as safe as people want to believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:09:56
And that’s what Bitcoin fanboys have yet to realize for whatever reason.

@_date: 2018-09-14 16:19:31
Thank you. I was starting to lose all faith. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:13:40
No, you are referring to a black swan. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:04:05
That’s fine you can use whatever helps you. I have passed the first 2/3 CMT levels and would be willing most technicians use log (base 10). 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:23:46
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:18
Can you but crypto without using an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:10:34
Since when is .65 a Fib Level........

Nice linear scale 
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:35:25
They are not “going to open” a crypto exchange. They said they would be open to it in the future. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:06:48
Not sure how to do this. I was told that the blocks only take 10 minutes so I assumed that would be the max time.

@_date: 2018-05-18 04:26:36
Are the negative numbers on the Y-Axis for the picture or for trolling? Because that would be some shit lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:28:03
This is the type of quote that justifies everything

“The Falling SegWit Pattern”
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:19:03
Fair point and I️ somewhat agree. Would you think is bc the futures contract will be settled in cash versus actual coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:35:10
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:09:34
I️ mean that when things turn down there will be selling pressure that most people in the crypto market have never seen 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:30:34
Thanks - better alternative as a currency or a trading and investing vehicle?

“Zooms out to a 7 day chart”
Zooming out would be to a weekly chart 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:01:18
i have a source in GS and i can’t corroborate this. However, i am intrigued. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:48:09
Target hit!!!

Charlie is one of the good guys in the finance community. He is always on top of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:23:46
I️ still have a screenshot saved from a text to a friend so I️ can validate a bet in the future
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:01:38
If you believe in it 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:53:38
Good lord I️ thought I’d heard it all...
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:52:08
Lol ya ok
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:05:34
If you were keeping things in perspective you would use percent gain not nominal gain... so yeah 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:57:22
I️ am a huge NNT fan, but however I️ believe it is still too early to call BTC AntiFragile  
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:45:06
Good for you sir. That is the definition of the American Dream! God bless! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:16:21
Those are the types of questions people ask before blow offs lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:52:37
GS would manage Coinbase much better than it is now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:05:00
Ok those are good points. i understand the “Indian Prince” example and family transfers in need, but in my example I’m talking about everyday goods/small items. Personally, I’m not sure where I️ stand yet on this part of the equation so I’m trying to get a good pulse. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:42:26
Yes - as crazy as it seems that is a daily chart.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:05:26
Me too
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:52:08
Yes the point here is how big the derivatives market is in size as compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:05:58
Seriously... some of these people are killing me 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:32:23
This is another problem. No actual concern for how capital markets work.

Forbes cites 78%
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:49:27
Honestly I️ can’t believe people in use linear scales. It blows my mind - it is technical and financial malfeasance to use a linear scale when charting a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:02:37
Is it possible the cancellation of segwit2x is a “sell the news” event - market reaction is different that a positive catalyst.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:13:52
This is the general problem that I️ personally find with BitCoin... generally speaking, most I️ have seen here believe that a (lets just use an arbitrary number) 50% DrawDown is unrealistic at any point in the future. I️ am not bashing BTC and I️ am not loving it. Like many stocks, commodities, etc there are always “fanboys”. That’s great. That’s not great. To be honest, I️ don’t care. If you’re trading or investing in BTC, the object is to make money. If you say otherwise - come on. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:10:19
This is the question that bitcoin fans never answer
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:10:41
Maybe... but when things re-enter the atmosphere they burn up :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:21:54
This is actually an accurate estimate imo. I have said for over a year we would retest 1600-1200 and they called me crazy at 20,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:17:10
Good one - however it’s typically funnier if you don’t explain the joke before the punchline. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:04:39
He’s moving the market at that point

Read Satoshi’s paper...
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:08:04
No I’m not. If you can’t understand his white paper then you need to do more DD on your own. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:12:08
No I just didn’t know that. Lol

@_date: 2017-10-30 21:54:12
I trade many different asset types. Don’t care what they are I’m here to make money. Obviously, Bitcoin offers no leverage like futures or options. Personally I have no crypto investments but would buy BTC around $1,200 if the opportunity presented itself. Otherwise, I can make more trading other securities. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:34:00
My personal opinion is that we will see a retest of the 2013 to 2015 consolidation at some point within 3 years. I will have a limit order at $1,160.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:37:23
Up $300
Tgt still $6875
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:03:14
 let me say this and flip it back to you... the value of BTC today is equal to its future value in perpetuity (I mean that is how people are thinking about bitcoin right? This thing is here to stay?). So what do you think? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:00:50
You obviously don’t understand the idea of position sizing then...
