Unfortunately, this can be easily compare right now IRL. Bitcoin is under heavy loads due to his epic success. It is by far the most used crypto-currency in the world while practically no one is seriously using Bcash at the moment.
Also, the "speed &amp; cost" main argument of the Bcash scam team will quietly vanish over time as Segwit and LN are implemented everywhere.

Actually I think Bcash is much more a case study about how much money a group of shady people can get away with by leveraging the Bitcoin brand to promote a random shitcoin. LTC and XMR are far better and more legitimate solutions to do cheap and fast transactions while waiting for Segwit and LN to be implemented.

IDK but why not make a honest, informative and simple to understand page on bitcoin.org that debunked all the bcash misleading narratives? Then we could raise some money to promote it all over the internet.

I'm not a dev but I would be willing to donate and help test the network if necessary.

Amanda died because she was using too much bad illegal drugs. The funny thing is the odds of buying bad drug is much higher when it is done on the street than online. Illegal drugs trafficking is obviously a bad thing but something that can't be eliminated unfortunately. I don't think that offering a safer buying channel to drug addicts is something that would makes the overall situation worst.

I'm pretty sure the bloodbath is not over yet. You should wait for first signs of recovery before buying some in my opinion. Great opportunities to enter the market are coming soon obviously. :)

Exactly, that's why you should never bet more than you can afford to lose.

That's a perfectly respectable position and point of view.
Some people don't have the stomach to be in a highly volatile market even if it offer good odds in the long run...nothing wrong with that.
