That's exactly why I said its a cruel joke, you force people into a soft form of incarceration, eventually into poverty and then get them on petty charges you can get an incarceration on when you're bs case on pinning him on the Malware/Ransomware hack didn't work out: 
Nerds have really become the 21st century gangsters/terrorist, and the US is showing just how Draconian it is when it does this. How anyone respects any form of Law Enforcement in this country with situations like this, Ross', and Asset Forfeiture etc... is beyond me.

Damn, I wondered what happened to him when they jumped all over him at Defcon last year; things just went dark and I expected the worst (sent off to some black site), but... what a fucking cruel joke. Good thing he has the backing of the EFF and his friends, hopefully he is taking payment via crypto for some dev work while in the US, that is a use-case if their ever was one: The State imprisoned me on allegations, and now refuses to let me go home, and it has stripped me of the ability to earn a living in the process, but I use Bitcoin, so what can Bitcoin do for you?
I just hope he doesn't get a kangaroo trial like Ross did...

Thanks again for your continued generosity, you really have covered a lot of organizations with your donations.
I wanted to share this as some may have not been able to follow the CCC this year, or last, and wanted to spotlight the Snowden 7 (refugees) that helped Edward Snowden when he was being hunted in Hong Kong. Suffice it to say it's best to [watch the presentation here]( but here is a pretty good synopsis of the [organization and its progress, and cause.](
[Here is where you can donate via BTC.](
I really like Edward's message this year in which he emphasized the core values of not just the CCC, but of Hacker Community as a whole. Remember: without Bitcoin, Wikileaks would have never existed; which meant Edward Snowden would not have had Sara Harris or Julian Assange to help get him out of Hong Kong, and subsequently Russia while en-route to S. America. 
Thanks for all that you've done, dude!

God damn that is a horrible track, 8.5 million for a track/album like that was his silver bullet and I'd hold those coin into eternity if that's what his music is like lately (I was never a fan, but he was big when I was in HS). 
And before anyone starts bitching, I just finished a refix of Middle Child's - Calamity (the samples he used are really good, and that bass line is weighty everything else about that track is just taking away from it) I'd like to see 88n8 and Yt Cracker both spit bars over it, if anyone is interested and wants to make that happen PM me. (It would be so awesome if this could be Bitcoin Barron pt 2 and dropped at Defcon this year!)
Otherwise it will stay as a personal dubplate, which would be a shame to be honest; also, I'm not great at editing so the track could use improvements if any one produces, but is solid as is if need be.. Also its lossy quality (320), but that is because he opensourced it and that's the only quality that exists.   
Its kind of crazy to think Crypto-Rappers (nerdcore?) has better production quality and tracks than mainstream stuff.

A Lamborghini, especially on the street, is the stupidest thing to drive if you've ever had track time in one or with one; especially considering most people behind the wheel are incompetent drivers unable to control (let alone use correctly) even 1/4 of the hp they have.

Except they already do if they accept CC, most who have never had experience with merchant payment processing don't understand the mechanics and subsequent nightmare(s) it all really is; its kind of why I sympathize with places that require a spend requirement on using CC. Or just flat out refuse. 
You often have to wait 30-60 days, and often as late as 90 days, before Visa/MC clears the transaction, the latter if you are considered high risk due to high chargeback rates. God help you if you mainly deal with Paypal as a middleman. 
So, by extension, waiting for a 10 min new block time is well... convenient to say the least to most. The bigger issue, and will likely remain regardless until we have an entirely closed ecosystem, is the fiat off-ramp.

The American Century was the most brazen, hegemonic empire to date; no other Nation has occupied more foreign land in its existence, not even Rome if you adjust for known land mass has had more than the US. Not even Britain in her height can compare, and now even it is under the yoke of the US.
You can certainly exacerbate the demise of an Empire by over-extending it.

Sure, use Craigslist and advertise for fiat but mark that you'll accept BTC and offer a small discount (3-5%?) for the car in the description and cover all bases. Chances are low you'll get anything in BTC, but you never know.
I put one of mine on sale there, and just put it in the ad description with details of the discount; I got nothing but tire kickers with fiat offers, the balls on these guys to ask for a carfax on a $1100 car! I worked in the auto industry, too, which made it ever harder to swallow how pathetic people were behaving toward such a low price car. I ended up selling to a local friend-of-friend deal for fiat to help him get his life back in order. 
I mainly cycle to work and around town these days, so if you can do without it, its not a bad idea to get rid of it.

Ahh, this never gets old. My favorite is the [guy mining in his Model S using Tesla's Supercharger network]( Awesome hack that still makes me smile to this day. 
The best one were those Russian Scientists, though: 
The fact that people will risk likely jail time or at least severe punishment if caught, shows we hit the big leagues now. Its a horrible gauge, but think about the implications of just the 2 above. A model S is 60k+ car, those scientists probably spent a good portion of their lives studying to get access/clearance needed to pull that off, greed will make anyone do stupid things, but still. Incentivizing people to act in a greedy manner, while morbid in its own way, should be seen as a metric of not a benchmark for success. Next stop is seeing those idiots who wait outside for a new phone/video game to line up for some BTC related thing.

Food supply/Food Safety, maybe you forgot the bloat we saw back in DEC.

Do you have any idea what this would do to the cost of food? (This is Ambrosus and one of IBM's Hyperledger aims, btw.)
Food is the largest, and arguably the most important, Industry in the Global Economy; second only to Forex, and that is only because it includes Ag/Food Supply chain. 
Listen, I'm sure you are still at the nascent 'Bitcoin will solve everything' phase of your journey, so I'll take that into consideration. But, the Truth is: Bitcoin is a means, not an end.

That they're futile, and will inevitably suffer from the same issues as tangible fiat currencies, in that they will change the rules when they feel like it. 
Crypto, BTC specifically, is already a Stateless currency, and a successful one at that as it takes ~$6500 USD to buy 1 BTC where only 8-9 years ago it had no value at all. That's remarkable! I'll stick to my nerd money, thanks!
Even a non-fiat (State issued by resource based) crypto is pointless: See:Venzuela's Petro.  
I no longer want to think in terms of nation-states anymore, it is detrimental to the Human psyche in the 21st Century; its an absurd archaic notion--comparable to dragons or witches--that is antithetical to progress if we want to achieve being a successful multi-planetary species.

Govcoin will be its own thing, someone recently went to one of the Federal Reserve committee hearing things and they presented their arguements for crypto and 'Blockchain' and why it should be embraced. 
What they left with is that Bitcoin must be regulated to death so it may allow for a Govcoin to have any chance. My conclusion: When this occurs it will have less utility and less value than Bcash and Doge respectively.

Yeah, Kraken and the Japanese government were supposed to broker a deal in which they get paid the fiat equivalent of the amount they held price out when Gox went down, last I recall. 
What a horrible deal, and further proof BTC doesn't need government to 'legitimize' anything. BTC-e paid their customers after being taken over by the State despite being a 'shady' exchange run by anons in Easter Europe/Russia. 
They also liquidated at the highs in large amounts several times, according to Jesse from Kraken, which caused some dips so they likely have plenty of fiat.
He said he advised them not to do that and consider doing it OTC, right? 
Anyhow, I'd welcome a sub 4k price right now, actually, so bring it on I got fiat to burn right now. 
Also, I doubt the bcash argument holds; you needed to have the private keys to coins held prior to the block height before the fork, Mt. Gox was all off chain, so the individual owners are not able to claim it. Would the Japanese government position themselves to take advantage (sell/trade) of that without the actual coin owners' consent would be an interesting theory, though. Imagine if its the Japanese government (at the behest of NGO) that kills bcash on a massive sell-off, that'd really be hysterical and an awesome foot-note in the annals of Bitcoin History.

Many good suggestions have been made thus far, so I only have two: 
Randy has been promoting BTC awareness and education along with providing medical and food relief through his site as the ongoing turmoil persists in Venezuela. 
Alexandra and her project Sci-hub have been the leading force in opening up scientific journal access to any and all who seek it. Ideally we will soon have an open access approach to scientific studies and literature for the betterment of Humanity, rather than have it as a pay-walled stream of revenue for rent-seekers; a notion once thought to be impossible and severely punished for anyone who acted otherwise.

Sobering, and well written; I've been saying we entered some stark Neo-Japanese Post bubble era (lost generations) since late 2007, and what strikes more fear in me than the Global asset bubble deflating and debt collapse is the total destruction of the Global Supply Chains (specifically food) that rely on this severely broken model. 
I'm not entirely convinced Boomers don't make up a significant percentage of the community now, every-time I went to a meetup there were plenty of them in the crowd, hell, I did a workshop with one! 
Either way, I don't think relishing the inevitable collapse of the stock market is desired, let alone a good use of one's time; instead the only the that has alleviated (some, not all) the turmoil I've felt for 11 years is knowing I actually did something.
If it brings home prices and commodities back to sane and sustainable levels, I'm all for it. Humanity cannot sustain this kind of reckless, devil may care attitude toward the environmental cost(s) Boomer lifestyles have imposed up on the Earth. The good thing is with things like crypto we can create business models not previously possible to correct these environmental disasters and ensure some corrections occur over time and create viable employment for generations. The social problems, as obvious as they appear, require a much more severe analysis and solution.

Granted, its currently semi-centralized due to the limits/escrow process, but as I said with time and several iterations it will be able to take CoNBase's market share. 
The issue with strict p2p in the US is that the State has arbitrarily gone after buyers and sellers and what are nebulous charges, which has quelled much of that; in fact that is how I normally used to buy, I just went to a meetup, talked to people and made a trade there in then in cash, but I fear that those days are over. 
Luckily I have other avenues to buy, but most don't, and this is what is hindering progress; I still think ATMs offer such a horrible UX that anyone not doing this out of sheer novelty would question why this is even worth it. Luckily things like Square/Cash App are filling a void, despite KYC/AML limitations. 
The rest of the World is far more advanced in this regard, Switzerland in particular, so while I'm a massive proponent of doing face to face purchases for fiat-crypto I think the risk has gotten too high for most to accept, so a trust-less technological compromise is what I see as the only viable option in the US.

I did the same, aligned myself with someone who would cover my expenses provided I had the motivation to do it.
Perhaps this irks me because I've been in this/seen this since this was a nothing project for the most part, and I benefited greatly from its free and easily accessible nature, most now see an 'established project.' I sometimes forget people will try to monetize any avenue possible when available so this is just following suit. I feel conflicted about that the most, as I do with people paying idiots like Tone Vays at conferences that discuss TA, but... I guess people are free to spend there money however they wish.
But doesn't that put it into the coder bootcamp cost at that level, is it the perceived prestige of saying you got it at MIT's course what they're buying? Which to date haven't really done much after all the media hype of them getting on board; odd considering they did the first air-drop to students at one of the most hacker-friendly universities in the World. They also hosted those events a while back but that's it. I did a Clim Co-lab project there and never considered to put that on my CV, though I have mentioned it during my presentations in the past. 
Not sure anyone but me and James D'Angelo from the BTC community have been in the finals, yet I don't think 99% of the World (or BTC nerds for that matter) cares about that to be honest.

Makes sense, use locally sourced meat rather than have to cover the costs of using beef, typically from elsewhere (Australia probably) all while profiting from the 'local' branding. Its just good economics, really.
I should think most multi-nationals would be thinking in these terms, but... I've had actual discussion with people who get upset that they don't get what 'they serve in the US' when it comes to this garbage. Even when the local stuff is better, or healthier. I'm still perplexed by those conversations.
The reasoning of this is all wrong, of course, but it seems what they're really buying when they go to these places is vicarious assimilation into US 'culture,' often what is portrayed in movies/TV; but, with that being said I had fast food for the first time in \~9 years at an airport and I have been nauseas for several days and feeling like utter crap.

No, I think that is real, [check out the projections for System D and think of the potential we have to on-board what may be as much as 2/3 of all of Humanity into a Global Economy]( add that to things like Mars colonization, mass automation, asteroid mining and planetary interconnectivity through things like SpaceX's constellation project and the amount of prosperity before Humanity is worthy cause of propelling enough of People to keep putting our heads down and getting it right this time.
AA was right to expound on that point, this isn't just a talking point used for self-serving ends (forks and centralization) like Ver's coffee non-sense. 
I'm honestly wondering when we will launch our own version of a Crypto-Anarchist Burning Man in real life, just to test all these things out; ideally not in a desert, I guess porcfest kind of counts, but there are too many closest Staists (Libertarians) in those crowds to feel like we'd get much more out of it than we've already seen.

That's a pretty stupid statement; some projects don't require the security and decentralization of BTC to achieve their ends, thus a coin and a distributed hashing network and node system isn't entirely necessary. There are use cases for that.
It may be boring by comparison to what we've been doing in BTC and Crypto as a whole for that matter, but it has value, how much is subjective of course. But enterprise level stuff has its uses.
I'm not entirely sure who the targeted demographic for this course is, but if given the right tools maybe they can create something we've yet to see with this tech?

Honestly, I always wondered what kind of person fell for this kind of stuff, those late night informercials weren't made because people were too 'smart' to see past them, so they must exist. 
Then I started going to meetups in the US where the average age started to creep up the 40s after having been mainly around mostly 20 somethings and people were openly talking about getting involved in ponzi schemes promising to double their crypto and how it was all going so well until they pulled an exit scam. I find it remarkable (mainly just how primitive the Human brain can be even now by a sense of greed) how easy it is for people to delude themselves thinking this makes sense. 
Then the ICO bubble happened and I saw it all again. I'm still incapable of fully fathoming how apt the Human mind is to rationalization anything/everything: its really scary, actually. 
I gambled with crypto to make things like sports interesting, knowing I could lose $2-5 of it folded, but what makes that different was that I got the experience of watching NHL playoffs with may more excitement than I would have and I actually won a few times.

Nice one, I said back in 2011 that when we saw a BTC Livery in Gumball we would draw the attention of the Youtube Car Vlogger crowds. 
Funny enough, the Lambo, Teslas and such bought with BTC showed up before that. 
My recommendation: Dorian's 'Nope' pic and fiat symbols would be mint, and maybe an homage to Hal Finney somewhere? The 2018 Rally will fall around the 4th year since he passed/was cryo'd. 
We should have LN by then so maybe a QR to get donations when you post after every check point or something like that to gamify the experience?

Honestly, this is why i don't think a Visa and MC will never really go away anytime soon, the US is too spend heavy and CC are just the norm.
As ubiquitous as Apple and Android phones and Apple watches are no one really picked up on tap-pay as anticipated in its various forms despite so many POS upgrades. Ingenico and Vodafone one make shit products, but they work 70% of the time, so they're good enough.
There is something ingrained in the US psyche with swiping a card to pay for stuff. In my experience its the only way to get people entice people to see utility in crypto was to have a CC equivalent UX. Its so odd how ADP will push that shit even if you have a bank account and job, social programs were mainly deployed by JP Morgan/Chase to do the same for over a decade, Walmart has done the same for the unbanked for ages!
CC aren't as common outside of North America, though, in the EU you have a pretty mixed bag from my anecdotal experience: In Germany no one uses them, In N. Italy cash was mainly used too, Croatia is wonky as hell, they have it for tourists, but so many places refuse to accept them same with other places with lots of tourism etc...


In theory, yes, in practice, the aforementioned muddies the waters so much. I honestly think using the most secure Network devised by Man is an overkill for day-day stuff on chain, now with an app that uses LN as Joerg alluded that will be the straw the breaks the proverbial camel's back in terms of scaling and in ease of use, the next big leap is on-boarding people, that is going to be tougher. But we will get there, will it be for everyone of course not, but that doesn't matter, Apple and Android co-exist as do a myriad of other competitors; this isn't winner takes all, nor should it be, really. 90 year old Granny in Boca Raton isn't going to give a fuck about 'Blowstamps' unless her dirty neckbeard grandson tells her to do it, and even then she probably lost interest in Money a long time ago and gets by with auto payments setup by the head of the Family. That likely won't change. (Crazy story about Sweeden's elderly dying for months and no one noticing because Autogiro since you mentioned Sweden.)
Anecdotal: I was just at a boba spot this weekend next door from a restaurant I ate at after my meal, where I tried paying with CC, my Amex in particular: they have a $15 min charge. I had cash in the car but going back into the parking lot and back was too much of a hassle as it was an unnecessary splurge and thought it wasn't worth it as it was just unwanted sugar; the owner/manager waved me over and said he'd take visa as I was walking out the door, but it had $7 limit, so I have to double my order. I shrugged and did as I thought why not. (The 2 drinks were way too sweet, btw.) I thought about it as I was resumed my conversation with my company, but in my head I was thinking, this guy must be paying out the ass for chargebacks and payment delays if you need $15 for Amex.
To be honest this is much more a social problem than it is a technological one at this point, primarily the limitations of a consumer based economy, but suffice it to say, we're not doing anyone any favors letting Visa or MC have the market-share that they have.
No one productive in the equation wins, not the producer or the consumer, just the needless middleman.

She did a good job covering all aspects of LN, and the advents and innovation that have since come this year; it was super cool to see it come this far in such a short period of time.
Also, she has gotten a lot better at pacing herself when speaking; I struggled with this as well, especially when sleep deprived which is always the case before an event/conference, and it requires a day-day dedication to practice and maintain that effort as you'll fall back on your 'default' setting.
The watchtower idea seems intriguing, albeit hard to envisage how/when it will be implemented with the details given, sounds really cool though, as crypto has placed an emphasis on Nash's Game Theory by rewarding 'playing fair.'

Its Wavecrest Holdings all over again, people are going to build around this and then when the time is right they will pull it again. 
As a person who did just that, we really need to pivot away from Visa and MC at all costs. This means more merchant adoption via LN channels, there is far more viability in that longterm than relying on Visa or MC to not shut it down (which they will).

Believe it or not the new Maxima's can be as high as 55-60k for the SR, this isn't one, but a Platinum but still they're pretty expensive for what it is: a bland looking Audi-GM thing with perhaps one of the worst engineering designs for Nissan I have ever seen. Its seriously a pita to work on, much like its German counter parts (Audi/BMW/Mercedes) now. 
How they resurrected the 4DSC badge for this monstrosity is beyond me, the 2002 SE 6 SPD was the last true 4DSC, it was bulky but Maximas always were, and it was a riot to drive for a FWD with the 3.5 V6.
Sadly, Nissan is turning its ICE stuff into this, it could be the Renault partnership or it could be a strategy to move all resources to EV by killing off all non-vital chassis sales/development, who knows... but Carlos Ghosn is a cunt.

The food actually tastes of something? The price not withstanding, which can be overcome using Purse.io, they tend to have the most variety of produce and products that actually taste good. And while I prefer smaller privately owned shops over big box types like WF or TJ: still progress is progress. Smaller shops give way better prices both to the growers and consumers in my experience. 
A lot of it is image, and I'm in a very minute part of the reason why it is that way today, but if given the choice (and I've done this plenty of times) most consumers (9/10) will tend to go for the organically grown product than the conventional stuff when given the choice blind on taste alone.
Price, and appearance are often the biggest impairments from my active market research--which spans several countries and continents. But when neither of those are a factor, prepared or cut, the observations are overwhelmingly one-sided when the criteria is taste alone.
Its not that food is over-priced at all, if anything its overwhelmingly under-priced due to myriad of subsidies and government intervention in labour markets and welfare allotements for said workers that alter the natural price-discovery mechanism of the Market. 
Let me put it this way, even in the height of summer, a tomato doesn't cost $0.99/lbs, the inputs require far more than the price reflects. (Conventional or organic for that matter.)

Is this what you inferred from my post? Because that is not what I suggested at all, I think things like War Crimes or Crimes against Humanity or the new albeit emotively-charged term *Ecocide* are a perfect example of why I wouldn't agree with this assertion. 
However, what I will say is that given the circumstance and the clearly obfuscated nature of the Silk Road trial, by what grounds can the US pursue a case against VJ? Did he deliberately produce or sell these drugs to US citizens? No, right? He moderated a forum hosted on TOR, and aided in the creation of DPRs to do so, but ultimately cannot specifically tie him to one location for drug trafficking. 
What country's law says specifically 'hosting or moderating a website shall make you culpable or liable for the actions of its users?' Because if that were the case, jail every fucking Forex, Big bank and LIBOR web-host/server owner in the Western World right now!

I think Bitcoin has succeeded already at what it intended to do, it was never going to be for everyone nor will it; case in point, just look at the Wikileaks and by extension Snowden's exodus affair, Assange (original cypherpunk) made it clear Bitcoin kept it going when all forms of donations were denied to them; what we need are more use cases and Shapeshifter is an amazing one with core values built into it, however, if you think it takes people like this to enter the ecosystem to make Bitcoin 'succeed' I think it is not only delusional its outright harmful.

That's a good point, actually; while XT was a still-born 'solution' to all of this and doesn't merit any more attention; something needs to be done about not just block size but of mining centralization. 
I've been quiet about all of this trying to learn more about the subject, but if the DevCore meet was true in saying that ~85% of all mining was sitting in that room and are all based out of China, something seriously went awry. 
The whole point of Bitcoin was that it was decentralized and resilience to domestic threats, if the Chinese government actually stepped in and put a concerted effort and took down those mining operation (they are in China partly because the asics are built there, and the funding is available there, but more than all of that it seems that subsidy based 'cheap cost of electricity' is the real reason they are there.) we'd essentially be left with a fraction of the hashing power. And we'd be fine for a few weeks until the difficulty corrected itself and if nothing was there to fill the void we may find ourselves in a place with like alt-coin levels of difficulty or at least early 2010 levels of hashing power. 
At which point a 51% attack is all too real due to the absence of the mining difficulty to not take this shit seriously. 
If this means that this is the outcome, it is not only sane that we increase block size for practical tx time, but also ensure that geographically-speaking 'Chinese miners' do no possess the bulk of mining due to bandwidth issues making it more favourable to branch out to Korea or Denmark, or Romania etc...
I understand that data centers in Iceland seem extreme right now (but I think there are some mining operation there already), and in light of the DPR case how the 'mysteries of US got a hold of the serve not withstanding directing our efforts toward a--less than ideal--failsafe is something that needs to be done.
Also, and this may be selling my own book, but [California is resolved to be 33% on renewable energy by 2020]( and with the [World's largest Heliostat project]( in the middle of nowhere in the Mojave desert surrounding some the cheapest land in all of SoCal (which depending where you are exceeds even Bay-Area prices in NorCal) the options are getting better. 
This place has been trying to bootstrap their economy as a wellness center/eco-friendly resort town, boosting it with proper fiber Internet and the associated injection of capital into there seems like an amazing prospect.  
Sidenote: I think California is already exceeding those projections right now with current tech, if I remember a conference from the director of the Resnick Center at Caltech that took place this year. Really awesome stuff going on there, too!

Ok, we're done. 
You have no idea what you're talking about. I have first hand experience to both of those projects by the way. And while I consider myself a bitcoin maximalist, and even tried to tackle this with Bitcoin on several continents with the Organic/Biodynamic communities... suffice it to say for how small that is: there are limitations to on chain.

Barrier of entry, complexity, and lack of moral character from the creator is my best guess. Put that together and you have the lamest duck in crypto since those ponzi scheme alt coins scams Garza was pushing--ok, that may be hyperbole, but its not far off.
I mean it was easier to get a Xapo card fund the thing with BTC, and then launch an Indiegogo or something to crowdfund a project than to have Lighthouse operational, I still think it remains the worst use of early-adopter funds to date.

Agreed; I think credit cards are not a worthy compromise, and the exchanges they are tied to make it a deal breaker for me to even consider, barring a few use-cases: Financial Censorship. 
Still, its a cool concept, and I'm glad it exists if only to remind people of how backwards we are conducting ourselves in our attempts of reaching 'mass adoption,' we shown ouw willingness to revert to the paradigm we sought to render obsolete: Visa and Mastercard networks are still necessary to make this function. (I feel like a satire piece with parallels to clear coke and 7-up should be inserted here some how.)
Remember, Wikileak's financial censorship by Paypal, VISA drove up awareness of why Bitcoin even mattered outside of DNM scenario, to the extent that even Satoshi was alarmed that the *genie would leave the bottle.* And *kick the hornet's nest.*
Where as Bitcoin was and should remain a decentralized p2p payment system, beyond the reach of said actors. In the past 6 years we have proven we can build a protocol with a token based currency which we can exchange value to one other without a need for a central party: it just takes more effort than we think most are willing to accept.

I honestly want to believe that theory for Gavin's sake: try to burn the past and my affiliation as best as I can and become a pariah in the Community I helped create and use a patsy like Dorian. 
But after so many years in crypto, and seeing so many compromise themselves and whatever merit the once held its very unlikely. I honestly think Gavin went to the CIA as a wide-eyed academic, got spooked by what he heard/saw, was forced to become the voice of controlled opposition. To his determent it worked as he is all but forgotten and held mainly up in a poor light.
Hearn was always a blatant Statist with a massive ego, with a background at Google, so the two trying what they did almost seemed inevitable. Perhaps even orchestrated?
Dorian isn't Satoshi Nakamoto, but the art is kind of cool and one wonders what that that last post on BTF would have looked like.

Hmm, nice *theory*, but you're talking to someone who thinks the word Regicide is the most beautiful in the entire English diction.
With that said, I find the collapse and rebuild of their economy is a more likely outcome; its just that the BoE got played by Soro's already so I think they exhausted that avenue.

His work is peer reviewed, and has been accepted since 2008, actually it would have been done prior had it not been for the blackballing involved; he suffered a heart attack not long after, so his work took a back seat to his health.
But here is his most recent presentation that I could find in 2014 at the EIKE (European Institute for Climate and Energy), and you can judge for yourself:
And who are you talking about specifically when you say *they* 'looked into his work,' as peer review methods are a standardized method of scrutiny in academia. (Which his early work was stonewalled behind.)
However, he has been doing presentations amongst his fellow physicists with models that actually portray a lack of cloud cover and thus increase UV sunlight penetration which is attributed to the 'observed' increase in temp, which is actually in 1 C over a span of years if not decades, not abrupt as you or the video are describing. (Rapid heating has only happened a few times in History, like after asteroid impacts that alter the Earth's atmosphere and ends Ice ages that allow for Life to begin again.)
Moreover, its is my personal observation that this is not a global phenomenon, at least not standardized, but rather region specific (weather is tricky that way) and Europe is actually suffering from a cooling effect, not warming. 
Farming growing seasons are getting shorter, and prolonged cold spells are affecting outdoor grows and yields quite a lot in cooler places like Germany, Switzerland, and Eastern parts of the Baltic. The UK suffered the worst rains in recorded history while I was there in 2014.
The video's parameters are typical of academia, they are too narrow and will continue to be made so to fit a model, rather than expand its model and theory to take in more variables (like what is happening in the Universe itself!) into consideration. The thing is, you cannot do a thing about Solar flares from Earth; and academia does not like to present itself as an impotent actor, the grants and funding for post docs seem to stop when you do. Hence the fear mongering approach taken thus far. And little no effort for solutions, even MIT's Clim Co-Lab's grand prize is a laughable $10K, which when faced with the problem is actually a sad reflection on the whole situation. 
(I don't have to be sold on this, I've already been working on this and have been for the past 3.5-4 years and have changed my Life dramatically to do so, but I find it absurd that these observations are not taken into account--which include my own, and coincide with my own observations even back then.)
Also, there have been more recent extinction periods than alluded to in that video, the most recent putting it somewhere around 12-15 thousand years ago with an immense melting of the glaciers. Washington state is likely ground zero for these observations, and the level of water erosion is like nothing that has ever been seen on this planet--suggesting cataclysmic levels of die off of N. America, supposedly 75% of all mega-fauna, which geologist and archaeologist have been finding more sites to suggest that number.

James D'angelo is the guy for this, he is ex NASA. Maybe we can get it to coincide with a SpaceX launch for maximum awareness? He's also the winner of a MIT Clim Co-lab in 2014, and just an all-around bad ass, really. 
I'm also a 2015 MIT Clim co-lab Judge's and Popular winner (collaborator), for our section, and I take issue with the typical framing of the narrative and premise of the 'Human caused Global Warming' argument responsible for cap and trade and the Carbon credit derivatives market etc... However, Climate Change is real and is happening, and is to be expected in a Universe in constant flux but is occurring for a myriad of causes that extend beyond our planet and Human activity--I've been a huge advocate of Dr. Svensmark's work on Cosmic Rays and cloud formation ever since 2008 when I first encountered it by accident and it opened the door to true scientific inquiry rather than bloated mouthpieces shoving platitudes about an *inconvenient truth* while jet-setting around the World setting the tone for the discussion. 
The truth is the implications of Climate Change are real, and solutions need to be found for these problems and need to be framed as a collective Human endeavor to ensure Human survival on this planet regardless of your national or political stance--or in my case, a self-interested apolitical motivation. 
We don't need hysteria, but rather a focused contingent of problem solvers: [CalTech's sustainability research]( and [MIT's Clim Co-lab]( are great examples.

The point is this farce of a judicial system has reached levels of outright mockery, and it would be funny in a Kafka manner were it not for the violent implications; at least the Nazi and Soviet Kangaroo courts were known to be such going in and were confined to their respective borders--which isn't much of a consolation actually.

So, then we have to acquiesce to State mandates in order to *disrupt* it?
That means we're no longer doing Bitcoin. 
Its not the sum that offends me most, especially when you think about Californian start ups like 21 or Coinbase coming in with millions of dollars in seed funding and VC money; its that it means we have compromised our value system in order to get some short sighted goal--in this case not being further targeted by the State's protection racket. If we yield to this, we have essentially admitted that our decentralized ethos exists in name only. 
Because what exactly will this ensure? All the Banks, and investment firms that run these massive ponzi schemes comply with these supposed 'regulations' which does not reflect their unethical, corrupt and immensely perverse business practices. And when they do get caught breaking the 'Law' they simply lobby or force changes to said Law to make them exempt of criminality and subsequent charges in lieu of a small monetary infraction. 
I'm sure most will play along if its passed, if only to escape the anal rape that comes with tax/permit/license dodging in California. But if it were going to play 'placating the State' game I'd rather spend that 5k setting up a LLC in an income tax free state while having an HQ in California than to comply to this BS; hell, paying double that would still be worth it.

This is actually the pre-cursor of how the Welfare State came to be, particularly in the UK, It was a self-funded medical based appropriation for communities of manual-labor based economies. Mining I believe being the most prominent if I recall correctly.
Unfortunately, this is also the foundation upon which the modern-day State  comes to be what it is today, as it has shown throughout Human history: the affectation to displace personal responsibility onto another individual is an all to intoxicating vice for Man if and when conditioned to accept the notion; it subsequently leads to many dire consequences we see today, regardless of how well-intentioned they may have began as.
The tragedy of the commons illustrates how  this pans out acutely and vividly: look at the devastation of the ecosystem surrounding most of the World.
 
I highly recommend Dr. Quigley's Tragedy and Hope, it gives historical context to the claims above, and while I'm not for any social safety-nets, I am however in favour of CONSENTED community sponsored, individual-based education via libraries and lectures, much like those of Ancient Athens.  
Its is my personal belief and maxim that the best deterrent to a social collapse and atrophy is a well educated populace that has a cultural integration and value-based perspective of their respective community. And even this has several flaws in practices as they are inherit to the Human Condition, but is still much more favourable to anything we have had for brief periods since Athens.

Never. That doesn't work, just look at the Non-Euro nations in the EU, they at least have a semblance of some autonomy and are less likely to pull a Cyprus. Then again you already have capital controls in place, so maybe that isn't the best argument, but just look at places like Slovenia or Latvia.

I can only surmise that you have never gone to a Bitcoin event or meetup then and that your (dim) view of BTC is limited to this subreddit. 
As far as I have seen BTC is almost entirely a millennial affair; core devs not withstanding. But most entrepreneurs and enthusiasts in the ecosystem tend to be 20-30 with your occasional token gen X or boomer thrown in the mix. 
I don't personally want to make this an age thing, this is just my experience from the Euro and US bitcoin community; and in my opinion it really should be viewed as **'forward thinking and insightful people see fiat as the bane of Human existence'** instead of OP's title.

And even with that said, they still remain as the nation of the highest priced Fiat in respect to Gold; which is damn near impossible to wrap you're head around if you've been there and when you see what their economy is like. They literately have no manufacturing anymore, are the [Western Nation with biggest Debt GDP ratio]( etc... 
It was in my estimation that due to population size, ongoing strifes with Scotland, Ireland and the EU that if they were forced to go at it alone they'd starve within a 6-7 month window, maybe a year if they reverted to WWII rationing due to the yields their arable farm land could produce. And I'm including their small albeit effective hemp cultivation to overcome mal-nurishment.

It appeals to the lowest common denominator and offers instant gratification, and reduces the steep learning curve... but as you have stated: at what cost? 
Truthfully, I was an advocate and user before, I even wanted to work for them since they were bringing in big name merchants into the ecosystem, but then the spying was made public... and even proven ineffective at deterring phishing hacks and with that all the respect I had for them went out the door when they compromised all their worth for their 'profits over principles' business model. (God help you if you tried to log on with a different 2fa option, which is why I never got to close my account.)
In short, it went from a noob friendly on-ramp to become the antithesis of what Bitcoin was suppose to free us from. I don't begrudge Coinbase anymore, a business will continue to operate and cater to a demand if it exists, this is basic Market logic; instead my issue is now with Bitcoiners who know better but act otherwise. Those are subsequently the same ones screaming bloody murder around here when they get goxxed or hacked or they lost their private key/seed because they always relied on someone else to do the thinking for them--and with the innovations, resources and options that we have now in comparison to the old days 2009-2011, there is simply no excuse.

It wasn't always like this, I'd say after the first price rise in 2013 changed things forever.

I probably shouldn't have read as much as I did as I have things to do, but where NAP fails, self-defense starts and if he isn't ready to defend his ideas and person to the very end he certainly isn't ready to be pontificating to anyone about anything.
What was that saying, 'if you aren't being threatened with violence you aren't doing it right.' Or something to that extent? 


I know that sounds all internet-tough guy, but having dealt with all of the aforementioned in the same settings the threat of violence is palpable at times if your approach is all wrong, which his was from the on-set, and getting high (impaired motor skills) with people you don't know was his biggest mistake; this is where innate survival instinct kicks in and clearly this young guy got a crash course in why you should have them to assess any situation, especially when confronted with idealogues--who are prone to violence, or at least comfortable with the threat therein. (Anarchist history is riddled with stories of physical oppression, violence and poverty, especially in Europe particularly in Greece during the Junta; he should have known this as a 'true anarchist.')
If it was real, and the experience sunk in, he'll be better because of it. I'm just reluctant to think so, as I can only recall what I was like at 19, which even in a university surrounding it made me aware of the absurdity of confronting 'the immovable object' with reason and logic and expecting nothing short of an irate, ill tempered child--even amongst people double my age. 


You become acutely aware that your resources are simply better utilized elsewhere--my battle scars with pro-war and anti-war factions taught me that very quickly.  
PS: I really think everyone should have their ass kicked at least once in life, regardless of circumstance; it teaches humility and enforces the idea that there has to be a better way to conflict resolution than physical violence, and a few kicks and punches to the torso are the best catalyst to that end.

I heard about it before in early 2010 but finally 'got it' after Wikileaks got thier accounts shut down and started accepting BTC, but SR proved to be a necessary component in our initial History; so he is entirely wrong in saying that. What I would agree with is that it is no longer an integral or even vital component of the current ecosystem, its merely yet another appendage. 
We have since evolved into something far greater, but DNMs were always a critical component of what we were doing--Free Markets unfettered by borders or regulation were the testing ground for a trust-less p2p currency, it helped us iterate from that.
As for the ETF, whatever, it was pointless and unnecessary and goes to show just how much of the current userbase is willing to compromise our project by returning to a centralized outlet in the name of 'mass adoption' so they can cash in on short-sighted profits.

I never said they weren't defrauding you, in fact, I stated that they continue to, but your claim was that:


Your inability to travel with your own money out of the country is enough to validate that they are defrauding you--and the extremes you have to go to exchange your currency. The inability to use crypto currencies as you see fit.
And this is just an acute one, but the housing crisis is still ongoing, which the State was/is responsible for. 
I wasn't aware that the proposal didn't go through, as you have alluded to; but it does remind me of those few 100 dollars they sent in the US after the bailouts during the latter end of the the Bush II era. It was an affront to any self-respecting person, I was a declared 'unemployed' student at the time so I didn't get it, but even so that small sum would have gone a long way at the time.

Sure, but what I meant to say that such an endeavor would be a massive undertaking for any other Dev working on this independently. Like Nopara did, where as the Blockstream guys could pull their resources and reputations to get something like this into the protocol itself via PR.
I'm no fan of Ver, the guy is clearly a mentally disturbed person who should seek psychological mental help with all of his money, so that propaganda about Blockstream = Bitcoin Core is non-sense, however, I trust that people like Gmaxell and Pieter Wuille etc... all have the same CryptoAnarchist and Cypherpunk principals that Bitcoin and crypto as a whole were built on as opposed to the glib and sophomoric understanding as your Ver and his ilk have. Gavin siding that way was the big disappointment from all of that, I still haven't entirely gotten over that to be honest.
Privacy was and remains WAY MORE important than scaling, in my opinion, and while I see things like Classic/XT/Bcash... as all wastes of time/energy.resources that would have been better utilized creating the aforementioned privacy tools, I'm just glad we're finally here! Stealth Addresses were an amazing advent that I wish would have been more widely adopted and refined, NoPara I think is doing that with Wasbi, right? Default mixing wallets would have been amazing had Darkwallet actually materialized and became the standard for all wallets and a had built-in fee calculation with ETA. 
Anyhow, I don't care who or what sources of funding they get, I really don't, as TOR is mainly funded by the US Government, and I trust that Jacob (yes, I still miss the guy despite all allegations) and Roger led the project with the best minds behind them to what is the best security tool for Anonymity Online to date. 
I think what's ironic about creating such Trustless networks and tools, is that we subsequently see just how rare and valuable Trust really is, especially in real life at the Community level (think neighborhoods and social clubs.). Odd turn of events considering how paranoid we cryptonerds are.

So I understand the leverage position, but I suck at the TA stuff, which I think is mainly BS anyway, but does this indicate that Institutional money or exchanges are creating a floor with this position?
Edit: A day later and the price went below 7400 (currently 7326), see this is why I think TA is utter BS and no one can really determine the price with any semblance of accuracy despite all the chart staring.
The price, in a truly Free Market, is an indication of way more variables and pressures than can be taken into account by anyone right now, which doesn't bode well for so many people talking about prediction markets/models and this is just another affirmation of why most of these hacks can't even come close to getting a decent average on price prediction to save their lives, luckily I want to go lower so I can buy the dip(s)!

I still remember that interview, that sociopath really thought he appeared sincere, didn't he?
Nice try, dude, it was only a few moments ago you were showing off your Gallardo in a parking lot in Tokyo, and now you're telling everyone you're filling in some gap as a missionary for the Red Cross from your keyboard... the guy is so pathetic, he removes the *artist* in con-*artist*, he's just so bad at it. Even his Mt. Gox thing was the telling sign of things to come. Karpeles has somehow redeemed himself, which is to say hardly if at all, more than this clown from that fiasco by actually going to a Japanese prison where he had lost all that weight and has come out and sad he is trying cleaning up this mess and move on with his Life. (Fuck the State's prison system, but the guy got a really big Reality Check, whereas Ver simply kept up with his fabricated reality and has proven to be nothing short of cancer with deep pockets.)

Listen, dude, I'm going to make it as simple as I can so even a person like you can understand: if you think seeing BTC and subsequently its value/token to operate on the most secure Network devised by Man at 5800 as a 'gamble' investment you clearly don't know what the hell you're talking about and should really consider other asset classes--for you or your clients--and perhaps even professions. 
I don't claim to know the Stock Market, its all bot trading, and things like derivatives/MBS/CDO etc... just infuriate me when I think about the economic disrepute they have caused the World over as they're always backed by the State.  However, I would never go into their spaces with any semblance of arrogance telling people that from my adept position what their risk appetite is or should be (~6% of networth, are you fucking kidding me?) and discourage them from on-boarding what is a massively undervalued asset, because idiots who only understand stocks and bonds want to create an ETF on BTC but keep getting their baby-nuts smacked every-time the SEC opens its mouth. And then after having shown 'supposed authority' figures significant increases in gains (in real time, mind you, as this occurred over the course of less than 24 hours from when I posted that) to them as evidence of why this was undervalued and still have them foment their stupidity and remain affixed in their position, its beyond comprehension for me. 
It doesn't take a person of your 'caliber' or 'title' to inform anyone of what this is if they understand some basic principals of technology and then when they see what WE have built thus far, with much more to come in the Future. 
And, yes, I say that specifically to exclude people like YOU from what I'm speaking of here.

Let's see you speak French, let alone make Art as well as his, before you start correcting anyone about how they use the English diction; more over, 'wanna' is not a word, its neither a correct contraction nor is it an actual word. Your statement should read: 'I do not want to be a grammar Nazi, however, ...'
Also, your use of ellipses outside of the quotation at the end of such a sentence is sophomoric and indicates you don't know how to use them correctly as it adds nothing to your statement, a single period is appropriate here.

I disagree with NullC in what they have to *achieve* to 'work' is subjective to the end user if we view them merely as tools, crypto is ultimately utilitarian, as are the usecase(s) to it 'working.' 
For example, I have yet to see why all this non-sense about sidechains and lightening network can be justified when a work around exists if you use any number of the alts with lower xt time(s) or those that are supported by Shapeshiter if 'time constraints' are the biggest issue driving you to create the aforementioned as they are instant confirmations. Coinomi's wallet allows you to convert back and forth for a negligible fee when compared to the obscene amount of resources and attention that is given to the aforementioned thus far--why we aren't building more cool shit than dealing with this topic is beyond me, worst yet are the personalities of some who seem to have verified my apprehension of them all along. (You know who you are.)
All of it seems like finding a disease to match a per-determined cure to me whilst marred by self-promotion and pathetic ego-stroking. With that said, I wouldn't bother investing large sums or holding any alts for extended periods of time for reasons Max described. That  doesn't mean they 'don't work.'

Oh, I wish they were even interested in doing that much, in fact its why I went... No one gives a fuck about Food Safety over there, that Walmart thing was a PR stunt. And Foster Farms actually already did that without a blockchain, so some good came out of it. 
What IBM are really into is pushing Hyperledger products on a SaaS basis, where they offer the platform for free, but want to charge to consult and implement using what they deem useful about a blockchain. Specifically for the fossilized banking system, which is still to this day managed by Windows XP machines.
Stellar is something they backed, too, which is as no surprise would have it: a Banking gateway tied to an alt. 
Its all very old World thinking, and had they bot let this blind them it would have put back Big Blue in contention for being a leader in Tech. Now, its just another has-been with more Federal Government contract bloat than anything else. 


While I somewhat agree, due to current sentiment at IBM; lots can be garnered from this information and implementation. But, I'm curious, what argument do you have against it?
I could have easily set that up using a RFID chip embedded to the freight that I require the company to use and monitor in real time (when it can have satellite connection) and track the GPS coordinates from farm to table with relative ease.

This was, of course, during the price rise in late 2017... so, anyone not stupid enough to sale prior to that was in the same boat.
I still think all Crypto TA is BS, particularly in a true Free Market, the only people who have any real sway in knowing price points at any given point are whales who do coordinated sells. Which is unfortunate in some ways, but in a financial sense still ok with me since my strategy has been to hold my coins and buy the dips.
This latest 5800 to 7k wasn't that bad, and I called out some 'supposed' Financial Advisor (some idiot from the Trump subreddit that posted here) for being a clown for thinking this was anything but temporary and easily recoverable--in less than 24 hours it went back up to nearly 7k. Now, this shows that someone who flat out says TA is BS in Bitcoin can get better results than these idiots who stare a t charts all day and make up theories and pointless rhetoric to justify their BS while the minority of us actually Buidl and understand the tech from the ground up and the immense uncertainty that comes with it.
I have at least 7.5 years of studying this tech, and building off of it in various Industries and while I'm confident in my buy-in points, often the lack of capital is my bigger issue due to the aforementioned 'BUIDLING,' I'd be lying if I said I had absolute certainty the price would do X at exactly this point.

In a way, scarcity; albeit entirely detrimental in it being viewed as a currency for everyday use, but to be honest that doesn't really apply to Modern Bitcoin either.
I mean the network is good and we have low tx fees again, but most people are averse to using it unless their is a fundamental need in which fiat (and its default payment channels, CC/Cash) is not better suited and as an appreciating asset its hard for people to part with something that will be worth more 'tomorrow.' (That's an illusion, of course as its just gaging the devaluation of the fiat its measured in.)
As of writing this, this applies to such a small segment of the visible global economy, but take the time to read up on System D and see why and how this will pan out if we on board even a fraction of that and how this all changes as a result. If you're going to start promo'ing this you better be well-read in many areas; History, finance, economics and tech are the obvious.

Why would such a person as Woznicak really care about this tech when so much of his perceived wealth is tied into the status quo?

If you mean him as a person and his 'role' in tech... I don't really think Apple (and by extension him) played that big of a role in getting a PC into my personal hands, so his merits are unfelt to me.
In fact I had a shitty floppy disk Apple II in school (which was dated even when I saw it) that we were forced to have to use and I couldn't get why anyone cared about these things, even Oregon Trail was lame as hell when I had Super Nintendo or Sega at home. Especially when I had to memorize a keyboard before I could use one, it felt pointless.
It wasn't until the Internet came around that I found any utility in Computers at all, by which time (mid 90s?) Apple was moot and nearly bankrupt. At which time I was on some way over priced HP clone trying to understand why hexadecimal code could give me infinite ammo on video games via gameshark and learning to hack Sony's firmware.

Model S 75 can be had for less depending on what state/country with all the rebates you're in actually, the factory has been pushing them out in larger numbers even with the shutdowns for upgrades on the Model 3 line. Its one of the reasons they're doing better on cashflow despite Model 3 ramp up issues being so capital intensive.
But, and I'm guessing this is half the fun(bragging rights, Community inclusion) for half the shit we say we can buy crypto with, so you can tell your other nerd friends what you did with your fake money.
Honestly, its a practical car, but I'm not paying in crypto for any fucking car... ever. I'll pay fiat if Ihad it, or could make payments, but a depreciating asset like that for crypto is absurd.

We'd finally rid ourselves of a massive tumor that has been destroying our metaphorical Health for way too long and can focus on the things that matter instead of the perpetual BS these guys have come up with (Asic boost, XT/Classic/Bcash) and all of the scams that have drained us of valuable talent and resources. 
There are other corps building ASIC chips, Samsung being the most notable, but GMO from Japan, and another Chinese firm, too. This may even encourage Nvidia to join the fray, they saw how fast those video cards were being bought up pissing of gamers, so they know there is money to be made if they put in the r/D. 
Overall, we'll be better off, even if the network difficulty has to adjust, I'm actually hoping we see a price drop at or around 5k so I can get more on the cheap in the process.

It appeals to the lowest common denominator and offers instant gratification, and reduces the steep learning curve... but as you have stated: at what cost? 
Truthfully, I was an advocate and user before, I even wanted to work for them since they were bringing in big name merchants into the ecosystem, but then the spying was made public... and even proven ineffective at deterring phishing hacks and with that all the respect I had for them went out the door when they compromised all their worth for their 'profits over principles' business model. (God help you if you tried to log on with a different 2fa option, which is why I never got to close my account.)
In short, it went from a noob friendly on-ramp to become the antithesis of what Bitcoin was suppose to free us from. I don't begrudge Coinbase anymore, a business will continue to operate and cater to a demand if it exists, this is basic Market logic; instead my issue is now with Bitcoiners who know better but act otherwise. Those are subsequently the same ones screaming bloody murder around here when they get goxxed or hacked or they lost their private key/seed because they always relied on someone else to do the thinking for them--and with the innovations, resources and options that we have now in comparison to the old days 2009-2011, there is simply no excuse.

I respect Abby as a person and as a journalist, she is actually pro-bitcoin and crypto from what I gathered, but how she can carry on with that Marxism narrative (past and current forms of) is beyond me, I mean I really want them to succeed in achieving said Civilization in which that all works for them, as I think Modern society must exist in plurality and some components seem eager to do away with things like Class and other divisive barriers and constructs that seem antithetical to Human prosperity and cohesion, but... this is delusional reasoning so long as you have a State in place, or even if the concept of the Nation-State exists. 
In fact, just looking over Bakunin's critiques of Marx written in the 20th Century would show why the devastation of Socialism-Marxism (both socially as well as economic) always ends the way it does in the 20th and 21st century, regardless of race/culture, Humanity while 'good' in many ways, will always be corrupted with Power no matter how lofty the rhetoric and that always leads to the regeneration of a State. 
I think they have the Right as Humans to attempt to do away with current ruling parties in the name of progress and try again, should they see fit, but this just looks like a vicious circle in which lots of people die for an Ideology that was meant to have a subservient populace at its very basis serve a ruling class of 'enlightened ones.' Centralization is the death of all broken systems, its just a matter of time before these vulnerabilities are exposed and exploited. 
Yeah, I don't think that video applies to a decentralized, uncensored, distributed an anti-fragile network at all--much less one built on the idea of ushering cryptoanarchy to the masses in the 21st century and specifically having anarcho-capitalist ideals built into its very core. Then again Medium is made up of so many hacks that will jump on anything trending to get clicks, so its hard to give them any credit, I mean look at how their writing style has been plagued by the use of limited attention-span medium seen in Social media; your writing shouldn't require memes to get your point across: your pen should.

Price and scalability follow a secure protocol, not the other way around... but whatever, 2nd layer is here and growing everyday, and Blockstream is finally focusing on privacy.

OK, this kind of shit needs o stop being repeated... when did 'we the community' ever like this guy? 
Barring his stupid antics trying to foment pseudo-intellectualism and lazy libertarian ideals it was very clear the guy had a very poor understanding of the tech. 
I was around back then, and can remember a handful of events that he mainly praised himself for could potentially be seen in that light: Buying a passport in the Caribbean with firework money and pontificated himself as victim of the State (mildly amusing at best: then and now), he helped fund Shapeshift at time such a thing was needed and then called out Vorhees when the bcash BS went down like a total drama queen chump, matched donation for Ross' legal fees (which really should have just been given to him as his retrial and subsequent sentence forgone conclusion, but whatever still nice things to do.) 
Other than that the guy has been nothing more than a lying, petulant, self-aggrandizing imbecilic attention whore that should really just do something to remedy his mental health issues. Such that when compared to an AA, who used to hang out here by the way, and was around the same time he was hardly ever 'liked.'  In fact him calling out AA for all the work he was doing, often at a loss, but not being a millionaire and thus a 'loser' he really showed what he was always about.

[Incidentally, IBM was very keen on getting corps to adopt this for supply chain stuff using Hyperledger]( with a less than lukewarm response by most major corps over all; I come from the auto/tech Industry and I really wanted Tesla to adopt it as it would be really cool to move over to them, but after actually going for my first interview at the Factory I realized that they use an internal program (Warp) so they are unlikely to ever adopt it as so much relies on it as a core function for its ERP needs.

I had an oddly located cavity I neglected (after paying a high deductible for my wisdom teeth surgery) for a few years due to quiting my job and taking an apprenticeship in Europe, luckily I got away with a crown when I got back to the US but it could easily have been a root canal according to the DDS. 
I still think it was caused when the oral surgeon hit my molar with the drill as I had two procedures due to how awkward and impacted those 3 of 4 molars were. It was in the most unlikely location and couldn't be explained why or how as none of my other molars had the same level of damage.

So, just out of curiosity, what are the exchange options for NZ? What is the community like, are there regular meetups; I mean this is certainly frustrating on the surface, but what it does is bring attention that ATMs are not a viable option--something I've felt all along.
I've been playing with the mycelium app on my phone since I got back to California and despite the large 'awareness' in California its still quite sparse to find buyers and sellers on it depending where I am on a given day. I mean for example Southern Orange county is absolutely barren, and the meet ups are not really all that frequent. I missed the last one because it was so last minute.


This should be a 'call to arms' so to speak (I hate war like rhetoric, but it shall suffice) to the community in NZ to get those meetups be where btc can flow. Fuck the bank's regulations, they can't stop that, plus if it all goes well home brews dotted all around NZ can be achieved for a fraction of the cost of what that ATM in that picture had to cost.

Hence why I asked the community what is Birk's history and possible ties to entities known to lobby the State against bitcoin: Mastercard or other Banks... and can this be a conflict of interest when persuading those with a monopoly on violence and 'Law enforcement,' and have proven time and again to posses legal immunity from their overt acts of violence and murder upon the 'citizenry.' 
Maybe because you don't live there you don't care, but California is poised to be in the limelight if this is approved as mom and pop shop owners or business owners will no longer have the negative stigma associated to accepting bitcoin. This behind closed doors seminar just highlights how nefarious these actors are, I for one still have the Californian GMO labeling requirement still firmly burned in my memory. 
As an anarchist I wish I could just dismiss this and continue with my own affairs as I have thus far, but when cash is regularly confiscated by police and people are interrogated at airports for displaying or having bitcoin related wares on them one can easily see how this will play out.

And we still haven't gotten privacy down and we have a huge gaping fucking vulnerability in regards to Blockchain forensics and  analytics by the State specifically because idiots like him are whitewashed as 'fallen angel' and have gained a position in which ht  can use his once untarnished reputation, his ineptitude and corruption to the detriment of what this was all about .
Maybe you don't see it, but Foundation hijacking and Classic/XT/Bcash are all the hurdles we needed to stall a very close to total anonymity application to BTC from being deployed, instead we got idiots following his diatribes about buying coffee with btc (I've done it, its nothing special) as the chief maxim and thus we derail progress for years while the State employs very effective tools to our detriment.
All I'm asking for is a thorough analysis of him so we can finally do away with him: Once and for all. The guy is and always was cancer.

Not dumb at all, in fact quite pertinent, especially with this whole Blocksize debate that has been going on. 
I did see a drop in dl speeds when mine was on, I'm currently traveling for work so Its not on and in my backpack right now. But overall it was not bad, no noticeable buffer rates on netflix while I browsed and streamed music/video and my usenet speeds were at my full max dl when I wanted it to. Also you can throttle it to only upload at certain speeds. 
So, I'd say if you have a decent broadband connection and you want to run one to secure the network: do it! 
I'd actually stay away from using an sd card for storing the blockchain, the read/write speeds suck, and I actually killed one of mine when I first started it up to dl the blockchain. An external hdd or usb stick would be my choices. 
Do a search on here there is ton of resources about opening the port and limiting upload speeds, but this is my favorite walk through:

How this guy went from hanging out with Unsystem and Amir in Catalunya to [rubbing elbows with the likes of Putin talking up the DAO]( etc... is still a huge fucking mystery to me. 
I secretly hope it was him who hacked the DAO and that those funds and profits made from it are being held for some re-boot of a version of Casa de La Montana on Mars or some sea-steading Ancapistan or something. One can dream, I suppose. 
The likelihood of all that being true is entirely unlikely, of course; but this just doesn't add up, ETH's mission statement is meandering and quite honestly still lost on me. 
Smart Contract were a a thing in Bitcoin since N-lock and multi-sig wallets, why go to such lengths knowing that? Greed and Pride are a hell of a thing, but, still this is one of those head scratchers.

I'd like to make an open appeal to the community, I know I'm not really anyone of importance here, though I personally feel I have proven that I live up to my own convictions which can be verified by post history and those members in the community whom I have met in person; but, I hope we can overlook all of that because this isn't about me and solely place the focus where it actually matters: Paypal continues to close accounts unabated.
I want to make it clear that I do not speak on behalf of the person, whom I will speak of and I do so only as person who has followed and benefited from his continued efforts, which is why I'd like to get all the efforts of community members to participate so that we can as a community find a solution to this rather than make this about 'me doing something.'
Fukushima Diary, created by Ex-Tokyoite Iori Mochizuki, is a website that has kept up with daily updates and news insipte of perpetual Media blackouts on the matter since 3/11--March 11th, 2011 when the Tsunami struck the Fukushima Nuclear power plant and created a severe melt-through and the aftermath ever since. He did his at his own peril, he suffered what most refugees suffer: isolation, uncertain, inconvenient living circumstances and poverty; he's been living like a nomad moving from N. America and Europe for the past three years .
He has opposed the idea that the paid media and its cohort of presstitutes should dictate the importance of an ecological crisis that impacts us all: radionuclides do not recognise borders and traverse the [World in 40 days] ( 
He has since dedicated his entire life to finding a viable solution(s) for Japanese citizens who fear the [implications of remaining in Japan] ( but are bound to it because of their family responsibilities and the ever-diminishing working opportunities or housing issues outside of Japan in a World crippled by a global fiat ponzi scheme in collapse, all while operating and living a Spartan life out of Romania. 
There he has been translating and researching news articles, interviews and publications regarding the nuclear fallout and the abysmal the matter in which TEPCO, the rabidly nationalistic Japanese government, as well as the World's governments have failed to address the matter--this personally affirmed why I'm an anarchist. The Japanese government went as far as to impose incarceration for whistle-blowers in order to deter information and data opposing the State's propaganda.  
He recently found a promising prospect on a Japanese migration treaty with Holland that was 
lost in obscurity, he did this without a law degree mind you. He travelled to the Haugue and networked with local lawyers to get a better picture of it and formulate an assessment. 
[Recently Paypal decided to close his account and seized 2 months worth of his donations] ( which he uses to pay for his expenses: rent, food, etc... 
No reasons were given, and whether Paypal will disburse the funds in the allotted 6 months remains a mystery, and he writes:
*I still don’t know the reason why that happened to me. Don’t even know if my donation will be released in 6 months.*
*Some people recommend to me some alternative services to transfer money on the internet, but I’m kinda starting to be wary of those services.*
**All of them can detain the balance whenever they want, none of them are under any kinds of the regulations. If it happened to PayPal, it can happen to other services too.**
So, I call on the community: lets get him up to speed on the security aspects of bitcoin, a 101 on how to use it, why its superior to legacy banking options and donate to him and this noble cause. 
We'll need Japanese speakers, Iori speaks English, but, like with anything, the biggest impacts is when one is spoken to in one's native language and is able to converse freely with another who speaks it fluently. Second we should try to generate as much attention to this matter as possible, make digital art, post the activity surrounding the matter on all social media outlets available, and lastly donate what you can; I only donated a small amount every month, but I laboured under the notion that every bit helps as a precursor of micropayments type of funding: unfortunately the one's who profited from these transactions reaching him would later take two months worth from what is in reality a financially poor person, thus confirming Paypal's negative stigma for nth time. I think we could all agree that this is something even [Dorian 'Satoshi' Nakamoto would be interested in funding due to the implications] ( 
This is why bitcoin/crypto-currency was created and perhaps more importantly why it matters; landing Amazon, NewEgg or any other reluctant monolith retailer after years of failed persuasion is insignificant and irrelevant. If I had a choice for why bitcoin would be in the Media's headlines once again it would be to see Iori being able to successfully finance his endeavour in Holland and helping the hapless victims of Japan due to this generous' community.

With 2 major exchanges/sellers-buyers (Coinbase, Kraken) an ungodly amount of VC money, a huge core developer community in the bay area, and god knows how many start ups I'd say California is standing quite tall in all of this. 
Take a look at Coinmap for Holland, UK, Germany or any place claiming to be the 'crypto capital' and look at California's merchant adoption and recall that its population is about less than half of either nation. 
California has perhaps the most versatile and eclectic selection of merchants, but I just want to be clear: I'm not championing California to be crowned the pointless moniker of 'Crypto Capital', but other than hookers, which both the UK and Holland have, California is looking good in terms of merchant adoption--whether it's legal or illegal seems to be irrelevant in practice. Which is the best expectation any crypto-anarchist can have.

Yes, and untold amounts of misery, bloodshed, bondage, revolutions occurred as a result of having non-commodity, trust-based systems backing them: I highly suggest people read Debt the first 5000 years. While the author's ties to Occupy made me apprehensive, and the book was recommended to me by a friend who is a communist anarchist, I have to say a great deal of detail is paid to empirical, and historical facts to make this point to the reader--ideology and utopian hints are sprinkled every now and then, though.

I had high hopes for Italy in the cryto community, which diminished in 2013 when I went there; now I'm more reserved on my outview, if they can catch up to Spain's early days I'll be happy. They have so much abandoned land/villages that they could get an eco-tech village with such a small outlay, and if you go further south PV may actually be viable. I only have experience with the North, but I worked with guys from the South and they told me its almost like Southern California with mild and sunny winters. 
Plus organic food commands such a high price in Italy, perhaps only second to Switzerland in my experience, that it begs for a return of agrarian-agorism and the decentralization of the food supply and its respective logistics--which just like in any Mediterranean culture is more than just 'food.'

Also having been in the city (London) more times than I'd like I'd agree that, yes, despite there being 3 atms drugs are still by far easier to procure than bitcoin. VASTLY!

Brian, I want to commend you for taking the initiative to engage the community on this matter; the fact that I'm not a miner and haven't actually set my own node due to constant travel (I may buy one on a VPN, but I haven't looked into it due the aforementioned) leaves me without much insight to give on our current dilemma, yet this leaves me asking why so many are diverting their hashing power to this knowing of its potential danger to compromise the very premise of the blockchain: de-centralization.   
Even if [Ghash is working on this, as some one here posted,]( the [Community must ensure that decentralization is not just a mantra but held as our very maxim. Unorthodox measures must be taken if needed and should be lauded] ( but Brian's proposal seems quite effective, too; provide said miners with a financial incentive to divert their hashing power away from Ghash--a Market based solution is always better than having to be reduced to such a wasteful use of finite resources. 
With that said, I really want to be involved with the Coinbase team now more than ever, and I will work on my CV to target a position I have been postponing to apply for due to other commitments because this proves to me why you have such a large marketshare. You actually earned it providing goods/services and are actively working to advance the ecosystem from a self-interested position that ultimately provides a benefit to all in the bitcoin community. 
Thanks, again as both a bitcoin user as well as a person with a vested interest in seeing crypto emerge away from its speculative commodity phase into the 'great equalizer' in a true Free Market in our lifetime. 
You'll be hearing from me soon via application, I already have an idea of a photo to submit when I do apply that I think you may appreciate. I should be back home in California by the end of this weekend and I already know what I'm going to do. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the bitcoin community: this is how a CEO of a bitcoin company should address pressing issues that threaten our collective interests in crypto currency: appealing to the community with innovative problem solving skills.

But, yes, I personally think Steiner and his almost cult personality is a diservice to the biodynamic agricultural practice, Biodynamics is bigger than Steiner, it always has been but the most vocal amongst us believe otherwise (and I can say this is a cultural factor more than anything having worked where it is most commonplace in the World); so move away from the idea he is the focal point and simply look at this from an analysis of product X vs Y and it becomes very obvious. 
Supersition is the immediate reaction for what you read, and it was mine at first as well, but since the spirtual aspect that is center in biodynamics has always resonated with me I was more receptive to its potential benefits. I was just as skeptical, if not more than yourself, due to my scientific background and approach to problem solving.
But once I employed the methods the devlopment of the crop and the end product speaks for itself, thus holding up for the need to base my views on emperical evidence--I used controls during my apprenticeship as well, and their were differnces, some more obvious than others. I have also worked on several organic and permaculture farms as well, and its just not the same. (I have also given a hand on conventional farms as personal favors to friends, and what they do there isn't even worth mentioning if we solely judge them on thier end products.)
But what you are seemingly unaware of is that Science and Spirtuality often overlap: [Newton was a devout Christian and used the bible to create modern physics]( Are either of us misguided? 
Scrutinize them for yourself and you decide.

This reminds me of when I told my friend to flip a hard u-turn, lifting a wheel on his rented Ford SUV in the process, when I saw a couple of kids making Lemonade in a nearby neighborhood while we were headed for his routine morning starbucks run, in December no less, and chatted the kids up a bit about commerce. I think I bought 3 cups, of what tasted like over sweetened koolaid, I probably would have bought 10 cups just to prove to my then crypto-skepitcal friend that you could use it to 'buy stuff.'
Ironically, I'd use that same Starbucks to pay for coffee (i think it was actually green tea as I don't like caffeine) years later and use btc to buy it. Subsequently that guy went in hard on various alts, too, and decided to quit his job and go back to school for renewable energy.

You do realize what the timing of the White Paper coincided with, right?: 


You didn't answer the question; you iaverted it by re-iterating an obvious statement which I had included in my own question. So, lets try this again: How is Ripple better that the aforementioned options. And how is the Laymen less savvy about them, as Tatiana-coin is an example of a laymen working with the community to get her project off the ground. 


My argument: **Price of Ripple Plummets as Co-Founder Plans 9 Billion XRP Selloff**
Edit: mixed up dates, it was Jan. 3, 2009. Not March 24th 2009 as alluded, but the point the White paper is in direct opposition to US TARP bailouts, and is clear to anyone who was aware/victim of said event.

I disagree, I think decentralized solutions like bitsumo are much better than a large monolith like Rakuten adopting it, sure it may provide short-term gains, but with a smaller more efficent business you don't deal with intermediarires who will place add-on charges the whole way or can specify on getting used products. 
Example: I used Rakuten to buy a kotatsu heater for my prototype kotatsu table, I ideally wanted a Japanese made unit from the early 90's or late 80's since it was just a working prototype; instead I was limited to buying an inferior Chinese one because I couldn't set up a yahoo auction account being from the US, and the extra charges from sending it from Yahoo auctions to Rakuten to me would have been exorbirant. 
So I compromised and got a newer Chinese model that cost over $70 which turned on, but did little else and the mounting brackets made my life a fucking nightmare when I had to fab up some fire resitant heat shielding. 
At least with a decentralized system you can appeal to local residents in a given country **to buy what you want** instead of *what is available.*


And I'll take your psuedo-day-trader coins on the cheap, thanks!


You are, hence my post above.
PS: Let me know if anyone wants a hand-made artisan wooden kotatsu, if I find the time I'd like to start fabbing them again towards the winter and will start taking pre-orders. I got everything documented and is open-source.

And no, France isn't; in all actuality they have been cracking down on sex workers for some time; which is another reason why French bitcoiners should be helping out that side of the economy. Germany, Holland and Switzerland are more open about its existence and use in their economy and I guess the UK is more receptive as well. 
Big talk from these worthless bastards considering they are fucking enslaving the masses with the use of fiat. 
That barbara parasite alludes to what happens when the State tries to crack down on something. Crypto and sex workers are something that just makes sense. 


While its unlikely to predate all of the others, prostitution definitely predates farming; agriculture is only estimated to be around 10,000 years old: at best. 
Nomadic people were certainly selling their young women into prostitution long before that for goods/services. 
Human history is certainly quite sordid; especially when it comes to matters revolving sexual activity. According to Debt: the first 5000 years, even remote tribes held this odd role playing death scene with an orgy at the end to bring other tribesmen together for commerce and such. Odd stuff that makes visiting a brothel and paying the sex worker by the hour look almost childish. Progress?

As do I, in fact I'm constantly traveling between the EU/UK (with and without the euro) and Switzerland and I have to take an opposing position and say carrying cash is absurd when traveling. The USD may be king in certain parts of Asia and N. and S. America, but in Europe its rarely accepted. But credit cards and associated fees are hardly better, either. 
The fees they tack on at an institutional exchange (airports will rape you blind) is abysmal, I had to take out 700 CHF to go on holiday in Croatia in December and in total with all fees associated from going from USD to CHF to HRK was about 50 USD.
ATM fees can be circumvented with certain accounts, specifically Charles Schwab trading with checking that has free international ATM withdraws. 
Luckily, I'm going back to the US soon and I won't have to deal with these matters much anymore. Furthermore, I'm going to try as much to transact as much as possible in btc since I'm from California with a great deal of merchant adoption relative to many countries where I have worked in and I will be in Colorado in the near future where I hope to be expanding merchant adoption in the agriculture (veg/cattle/cannabis) community and pertinent good/service providers who have draconian banking laws imposed upon them. 
Its ripe ground for crypto and I'd really like to work with the community to make that happen, Coinbase merchant wallet and Dark Wallet is the obvious solution, but I'm open to suggestions.

Its actually not just MMJ dispensaries that can benefit from crypto but also farmers; I won't go into all the details now, but I'm involved in the Colorado agriculture community--just completed my apprenticeship as a Master biodynamic gardener and owner of farm land in Colorado--and right now the supposed 'legislation' created to aid business owners and farmers with ties to the cannabis industry (Marijuana or hemp related) are actually barring them from having bank accounts or getting lines of credit. Its all dependent on the federal reserve approval that is unlikely to get approved, and requires you to show proof of 'distress' caused by the current banking system as a business owner.
I have so much on my plate right now, but I'm actually trying to get in touch with key members of the community: Unsystem, Etherum guys to see if we can get a working un-banked model up and running before this fall harvest. Darkwallet is the best alternative, but not really user-friendly.

Oh, and just so its clear [Bitcoin Suisse AG was the crew behind getting an ATM sent over for the Bitcoin boulevard in Holland at the last minute,] ( they are part of the community; and the Geneva bitcoin group is tiny in comparison to the one in Zurich so I cannot imagine their being that much traffic on the SBEX (who/what the hell is that?).

Swiss banks won't touch US citizens/passport holders, even with permits. You will get eaten alive using your bank account to withdraw cash using banks in Switzerland. 
Bitcoin can only circumvent this if you have someone lined up to exchange BTC to fiat because the ATM in Geneva is a Bitacess unit (Fiat to BTC only). 
However, and I'm not advocating this in anyway, and I highly stress you do your own due diligence given the history of exchanges, but I just came across this post on BT.org: 
I'd open an account just in case they offer BTC to CHF by the time you arrive to have as a plan B. Last resort is to get a Charles Schwabb broker account with a checking account with ATM fee waivers. 
Or, and this is really reminding me why I hate the legacy banking model, you can jump the border to Germany, Italy or France if you have a ATM alliance bank account (Bank of America etc...) and take out large sums. Just be warned, Euros are not always accepted everywhere and coins will be turned away on Switzerland.

Its not beyond me to state the obvious: this is blatantly manufactured, glossy tear-jerk PR for the disenfranchised to feed upon and repeat the same cycle of debt and serfdom. 
But that entrepreneur story really resonates with me; I'm bootstrapping my business and having to work 11+ hour days of manual labor and then having to do enough Market research to maintain relevance on the other side of the World, keep up with advances in crypto to achieve these goals, reaching and collaborating with people in 4 different time zones etc... 
And yet I think the hardest thing to accept is that applicable knowledge, productivity and wealth creation have all become a liability, not an asset in the perverted financial system we've been coerced into; its impossible to ignore how the corrupt or the corruptible are able to amass so much in so little time, which ultimately further concentrates wealth in the hands of the most nefarious in the World which further prolongs the collective misery by mis-allocating resources to the least productive people and endeavours.

Agreed, I have worked in and with organic, permaculture and biodynamic farmers in over 10 European countries and while they are at first skeptical and doubtful, when they hear about the possibility of instant payments, low cost POS systems and lower overheads than VISA/Mastercard they tend to be far more receptive to the idea of using 'magic wizard internet money' for their goods/services.
The media is certainly not helping with their constant spotlight on dread's alleged hits, Mt. Gox, 25% VAT propositions, Dorian's doxxing and the other endless list of FUD the pressititues can conjure up.
But the learning curve is steep, and to date Bitpay is still a challenge for most of the owners/growers to adopt, they are lost when they hear crypto-currency, api, public and private address, cold storage, hot wallets etc... let alone manage to get them to work effectively. I offered to spend time with the staff on checkout solutions, who are often the children and a bit more tech savvy; however, just like anything else they are reluctant of the idea that cash exchanges or card swipes are not taking place in front of them as their products walk out the door. Although, that is to be expected for a culture (agriculture is certainly a culture) that is realistically still stuck in the 18th century for the most part. 
What did work in my experience was to offer to use my coinbase account for accepting payments with daily payouts (to fiat) on my end. Its far from ideal, but baby steps are they only way to persuade 5 organic merchants to accept them at a farmers market. It fell through at the end, but it was a worthwhile endeavour. 
With that said, agriculture, ISPs and energy (like that utility in Holland) are really the sectors that motivate me most to bring in crypto-anarchy's decentralized business models and will definitely make the biggest impact in the ecosystem: not landing fucking Amazon, Fry's, Newegg et al. Desalination water stations would also be huge, but those outlays are often in the billions, so realistically not yet on bitcoin's horizon. But one day...

*The 43-year-old visited the construction of the Delhi transit station  a few years ago and was disturbed by the sight of  many children  playing at the site instead of attending school.*
Just so you know the origins of modern academia (and many would argue the post industrial revolution labor market and finance system) has its roots in Prussian and Indian military class hierarchy/caste system.
While initially I was actually encouraged by the idea of a man taking it upon himself to undertake such a task, I'm reminded of what and how pedagogy is rationalized: just as the path to hell, it is equally paved with good intentions. 
I wish those children well, however they may chose to persue thier education, which isn't strictly limited to labouring in front of an authority figure who assumes the role of gatekeeper into enlightenment as it is portrayed in a 'class room.'

You're using an argument based on averages to conjure up a false image; I was there, I saw how exactly NO ONE used the ATM in either case. I mean this lends itself to obvious biases, perhaps other locations are frequented more than others, but who knows.

Well done, mate. I stand by my claim.
Regarding the ATM, I'm not the biggest advocate of them as they tend to have encumbering features: palm scan, ID verification, etc... all of which are counter-intuitive to a decentralized and pseudo-anonymous monetary system. 
What few things I gathered from them is that they're capable of offering lowest barrier of entry for the 'uninitiated' as an impulse purchase. The issues that arise from them in my view make them impractical by contrast to local bitcoin/meetups/satoshi squares; they need to be monitored, or have someone staff them so they are not exactly stand-alone, and can be compromised due to exchanges not offering at the point of purchase. I was just wondering if there are actual metrics and data that support the idea they are a worthwhile investment in areas outside of places like Bitcoin Boulevard that aim to highlight Bitcoin. I based these observations on the news from Canada, US, UK ATMs.  
Either way, thanks for proving why this community is a worthwhile endeavor.

So in summation, you agree that ' a huge decentralized conglomerate of third parties' is superior to that of a central one (such as a central bank), who among other crimes, are known to have willingly encouraged banks to issue debt based securities, bonds, liens etc... that wreak havoc the World over and has stifled living conditions and quality for not just my generations (millennial) but throughout the World unabated. 
So I ask, why the hell should we care about debt based securities/derivatives when we see what happened in 2007-2008 when this power is granted? And just how ignorant the masses are about the implication sof having your economies GDP dwarfed by these machinations (e.g. shadow banking system with a claimed +$600 trillion derivatives pool) I mean, I don't discourage them to do so, I just don't see any advantage to doing so.

Are there no exchange options for Japanese bank account holders since the Gox clusterfuck? 
This doesn't seem right, what happen to Kraken? 
He was wining and dining with the political class a few days ago, no? 
These ATMS are the antithesis of bitcoin, their novelty wears out thin and deters people who have never heard of bitcoin when they see the scanners, cameras and govt id requirements to buy them. Also, people don't always know about what miner fees are and end up having their funds in blockchain-limbo. So unless you have staff on hand to guide the noobs this seems all together pointless. 
At least the Lamassu unit is more intuitive, not advocating for it just pointing out a personal observation of mine. What troubles me with the Lamassu unit is aren't people holding onto their docomo flip ketais?

No, you're right; I overlooked the info and was fixed on the title and imposed my own views on something that wasn't asking to be addressed; but the fact remains that if industries or companies, any, are unwilling to accept bitcoin of their own volition or by consumer feedback just assume that they aren't going to. 
I think the ecosystem is developing fast enough that barring rent or utilities (and there are exceptions I won't list here) we have options and avenues to pursuit; unfortunately should that fail, as it is subject to doing so, we always have fiat conversion. 
Gyft filled that giftcard niche a long time ago, bitsumo, and Moneypak are others, but as I previously mentioned these are merely short-term solutions for an intermediary transition; the best way to accelerate merchant adoption and overcome the 'awkwardness' is to engage with the desired producer to accept it and take it from there. 
As Andreas once said, ask them 'Do you take bitcoin **yet**?' Entrepreneurs are savvy people and are able to discern these messages, and if they don't they tend be left behind and rightfully so.

That is a step in the right direction, the lack of focus of the Bitcoin community in something as vital as agriculture is absurd; if this is truly a revolution, the 'powers that be' will always target the fragile (petro-dollar centric) food supply to get the masses in line or start massacaring each other, History has shown the latter to be the most likely outcome(s). If anything needs to be decntralized its ther food supply/accesability.


Show them some love. :)


I like your line of thinking, but what I see being the future of food is actually an eco-tech-village (this is what I think is the TRUE DAC) that supports the needs of its residents within the community and sells its excess vegetables/meat/products to neighboring communities/towns. CSAs defintley play a role.

Edit: To Circle circle-jerkers; come at me, bro! Bringing in Overstock and Dish network is more than Circle will do for the ecosystem. Especially since the CEO of overstock holds part of his BTC, and encourages more merchants to do the same to avoid getting into fiat. Whereas that is circle's biggest (vapourware) feature.

True. 
My first experience with a true Silk Road type of Agorist market place for agriculture was in Italy, and it was awesome; we had all kinds of vendors with amazing organic products that could never enter the Market because of a lack of designations from the EU or local regions (Parma, Genova etc...) for affordable prices. The prepared dishes were quite boring, though for some reason.
It was more a festival than anything else, there was a live guitarist doing a karaoke sing-along in the evening that the people really got into; and they dedicated 'California Dreaming' to me, too. I even got an offer to go work on a new project to help with organic agriculture in Morocco, I had to pass, though.

Copy and pasting a public key from an online hot wallet doesn't require this; this is more of a 'look how impractical bitcoin was' than a presently relevant one.

Normally its an absurd concept, but since California is home to some of the biggest exchanges, and god knows how many VC backed start ups in the ecosystem its a good sign to know they won't crack down on them. And given this is Silicon Valley we're talking about I'd expect the billionaires looking to diversify to take another re-visit about this whole 'magic internet wizard money' now that its been 'embued with State approval.'
Its not important as many would have you believe, we've been operating as though it were the whole time, but its not an entirely bad thing for a place with huge amounts of Capital, high-tech human capital, and a manufacturing industry bigger than most European/Asian/African nations to excercise what it has done for a long time: utilizing purpose built competing currencies is uniqely Californain and a part of our culture of disruption.

I don't know much about Asian off shore places, but from my experience most of the money in the West (Switzerland, Cyprus, Malta, Luxemburg etc...) seems to be moving East with the occasional Channel Island picking up some of the traunch along the way.
In terms of viability for that part of Asia, what are the demographics like? I only link things to Petronas in Malysia and a few enginnering schools associated to them being tech savvy enough to consider it; everyone else seems to bend to the government's iron fist by the looks of it. 
It would take like a 7-11, which are huge in Asia, or something along those lines to do a really hard campaign to get btc off the ground there, by my assessment.
Other than that glib overview I tend to only focus on Japan, and btc adoption is not doing well there... Kraken made some PR waves, but to be honest Japan has much bigger problems right now so I don't see that changing in the near future.

I'm so perplexed with that mentality, I really like you guys as a whole and it was a highlight of my time in Europe meeting many of you and collaborating with you; but this almost exceptionalist mentality is American in every way; these constant rationalizations for such obvious confinements makes me lose my mind whilst in conversation. God help you if you pull that shit on me while we're working on something. 
Granted, I have a team of people who embrace my disruptive nature, or at least tolerate it while we collaborate, but this is something I can never get over. 
I mean I'm from California, and by extension the US; and this just resembles how someone can rationalize the crimes the tyrannical State commits against its populace... its obvious mental conditioning, and an absence of logic and reason. 
Oh, well, at least the Swiss Parliment are maintaining a hands-off approach for the time being, and Localbitcoins and Meetups are still the best way to get involved in the community, and lets see the State try to stop those and impose their regulatory mandates there. (I guess they have with the ATM stuff, but no one ever used them.) 
Anyhow, I'm glad you can see through this thinly veiled co-op; fascism is alive and well in the bitcoin space. I expect it to be on the rise as we're coerced into 'the road to legitimacy,' I'm with Andreas: Fuck off, Bitcoin is fine!

As someone with a DEEP vested interest in the matter all I can say is we cannot implement bitcoin fast enough and render these archaic, despotic monoliths obsolete soon enough.
Support your local organic farmer; the State has made buying non-GMO or pesticide laden food as much a form of protest as prepping, buying precious metals, cryptocurrency or anti-war movements combined: organic agriculture is involved in all of these things. 
And food for thought (pun intended) if you think the EU is better off:
I ask my fellow health scientist involved in the bitcoin community to do some serious soul-searching; this cannot be done without our superior intellect being sold to the highest bidder for pennies on the dollar, these kleptocrats and megalomaniacs are as dull witted as they are greedy.  
*I'm not sure if bribing these criminals would be beneficial long term. Bitcoiners should focus on creating and improving bitcoin exclusive economies, both on the internets and physical.*

Political *solutions* in Italy... lol... I agree with him.
This could certainly be the currency for the younger generation's System D. I have intimate knowledge of certain 'happenings' in Italy and when they say that places in Europe like Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal have a 'black market' that encompasses as much as 40% of the economy they are not lying. 
This is really why projects like Dark Wallet and Dark Market are so important, get away form Cody's 'money laundering' claims and you can start to see what is really at the heart of these projects; its not just edgy a-political teen age angst that precipitates these projects into existence, its necessity for a large part of the population. 
The older generation is unlikely to adopt in any significant manner, and I hate to admit how I know that, too; but I hold out for the Italian youth to emerge with their own solution, when I was there last year no one even cared and going to Germanic or Scandinavian countries was seen as the 'saving grace' for a Southern European with an EU passport. 
Now, with places like Calafou and the Unsystem guys in Spain showing the potential of eco-tech villages I hope more will emerge; there are parts of Italy that are abandoned and uninhabited where its possible. Which made me wonder why parks are so filled with homeless people and refugees from Africa when land is quite plentiful the further you get away from major towns/cities. 
Either way: Andiamo, raggazi!

Consider it a worthwhile lesson, and get to know why being your own bank comes with a greater need for responsibility and forethought than your average 'ZOmG, new phonzorz!' consumption addicted person.

Also a quick question, since you are in the 'business' do you happen to have any metrics of use for the atms in Zurich (temporary?) and the one in Geneva this year? 
I just returned to Switzerland after spending time in the UK, they were in a really good position to capitalize on user availability--Zipzap, ATMs, Kraken, IBWT, ebay, local bitcoin/meetups--but after the goxxing and the VAT-tax law 'limbo,' Doxxing all the merchants I had lined up to adopt decided to 'see how things turn out afterward' or had reconsidered last minute; I always wondered what true potential the ATMs would have over the other means.

Here is study I followed for a while that sought to find out:
Check out the Poulter (2012) study for a more through and prolonged study on rats. 
Its not for the faint of heart, and when you're done with that look for the Russian TV show that never came to be that was going to exhibit the daily affairs of lab rats who were fed only GMO foods, they used a study done in France as the basis for it. Do a little bit of research and DDG this: University of Caen NK603.
Sure, it was a trade war spectacle using reality TV shock-jock tactics, but the fact remains the implications are there for all to see. How effective it would have been would have been an eniterely different question, especially because prior to the embargo Russia has been highly dependent on Western food supplies.

Spoken Italian comes natural to me, but reading or writing in Italian might as well be French due to the grammar and syntax. I can muddle through if in a pinch, street, bus or train signs are obvious but anything more elaborate is a strain. And anything not written in Romanji... pfft, forget about it.

I saw some pretty damn expensive (as in multi-million dollar) New Holland tractors with self-driving kits installed in Bern-- it was really an organic expo presenting the benefits of flax to local organic-biodynamic farmers that had corporate sponsorship (COOP). 
Let me just say that they left much to be desired, and that the farmer who can drive a tractor isn't going away anytime soon. It was eventually able to harvest when a driver sat inside and kept it from veering off the crop row, Sat-nav isn't precise enough to have it be fully automated I'm affraid. 
The sat-nav was not able to make the minute corrections needed for it to harvest the crop without incurring a great deal of loss. 
With that said, I actually am one of the few farmers (I consider myself a 21st century Biodynamic farmer) who look forward to automated systems, because as you said very few WANT to be a farmer, I strugle with it myself with the workload-to-pay ratio, but here is a pretty cool articles on doing just that:

With that said, I really wish that they won't dwell on that on the matter for too long, and can instead focus on their upcoming alpha release of the Dark wallet, and what improvements their beta will have and how the community can help expedite that process.

I have some rudimentary ideas but nothing really fleshed out yet. 
Also, I think some people had questions regarding rewards from the indiegogo project, I only donated to the donate address so I wouldn't know, but I recall some were asking about the shirts not being delivered, anyhow that is more relevant than another vapid discussion of a name for a piece of (CROWD-SOURCE FUNDED) open-source software.

I think promos are like the best revenege: living a better life than your opposition. Lets see some more of that instead and I can list a number of projects (some my own) that could raise awareness to do just that; the market share increases will follow all on its own in a gradual manner, perhaps just not when you want it to. Besides, despite what many think bitcoin, its not ready for prime time yet since we're limited to so few transaction per block and influxes in hashing power (Chris Ellis mentioned this in his show about the largest one to date) makes me think of several implications. 
The blockchain wouldn't be able to handle such a large influx all at one time, and I'm not one for off blockchain alternatives--what the fuck is the point of Bitcoin then--so I like it where it is now since we're still getting major VC money flowing in nicely, and merchant adoption.

The State does absolutely nothing that produces wealth with much if its holding under the nefarious property acquisition that has taken place since the inception of the empire--with historical precedence I tend to lean with it serving as a severe bottle-neck which creates a consolidation of wealth producing assets that aids their paymasters in multi-national firms.

Exactly. I have a more reserved view of bitcoin 'critical mass,' as everyday passes; its simply too complex for that lay person to understand now, and unless the systems which will replace those use the blockchain protocol without the customer being aware of it, I think $XX billion market cap, which is still to be lauded when you consider where we came from since 2009, is where we will remain.

But the arbitrator aspect its still the weak point in all of this, its very easy to lose the trustless aspect of bitcoin when its most needed when you rely on escrow systems.

I'm all for supporting Unsystem, as I have donated in the past and will continue to do so, but what exactly makes you think they are low on funds? Cody was asked in a recent interview if they needed financial support, and said they didn't at the time; Amir Taaki's group received 20k for hackathon in Toronto; Unsystem raised 50k for their work on Darkwallet; they have [15 BTC sitting in the multisig account]( and it keeps growing everyday. 
I'm not trying to discourage supporting Unsystem, far from it if you look at my post history I'm almost bordering on a fanboy; I just think unsubstantiated claims of their financial state from an outside perspective is unproductive.
If anything, I think their focus would be on raising funds and helping Ross Ulbricht's defense fund given how outspoken both Cody and Amir have been about the matter. (Brave New Books from Austin also threw their hat in the ring.) 
With that said, I really wish the Unsystem would address the matter of rewards on Indiegogo, but that delay could be due to their busy schedule leading up to both Dark Wallet and the Dark Market. Other than that the guys have been doing a sterling job and are certainly responsible for the most exciting progress in the community in a sea of PR friendly software name changes, Chinese fud, State regulations and countless Goxxing headlines!

I think this warrants an AMA with the creator, and for him/them to open source the code. Plus, just as I said with the guys who took over DarkMarket (Bazzar), who are the escrow users how will you overcome the intial absence of reputable ones, and lastly how will your service overcome the proof of delivery aspect to release the funds from escrow? 
I'd like to see this, in fact after Dark Wallet this is the 2nd in my top 3 things I want to see in the development side of bitcoin with Xapo bringing their ATM the 3rd on that list.
PS: You're talking to a bunch of crytpo nerds, no one here is going to dl some software where we run our wallets or miners from; think this a little but further. I'm getting a little bit of deja-vu of the whole stealthbit thing from a while back that stole a bunch of peoples funds, not saying you will, but like I said: think this a bit further, the odds are in your favor to follow through since you'd beat Bazzaar to the punch.

Why ING/Capital One is not an option:
They may have 'paid' it back and BOA is by far no better, but until I can find a Credit Union I can register with faster turnover it will have to remain. I never keep anything in the account for more than 24 hours, I always transfer into BTC via coinbase and they take the funds in 1-2 days afterward.

Armory client walk-through that does a good job going through the particular aspects for long-term cold storage and an elaboration to transfer from cold to hot wallets if needed: 
I'd diversify into other commodities if had that much in savings, gold and silver are the obvious ones, but arable farm land (then land-lease or crop share) or local farms are worth consideration; perhaps extending a line of credit at a reasonable interest rate (2-3%) to lessen the impact of inflation when denominated in Lira, which also adds liquidity in productive commerce and creates access of supplies for your restaurant which can later be bought at cost or near to it.

Funny enough I wanted to see who would be the first to do mail order stuff in CO, at first I though it would be red card holders; but this kind of initiative makes me smile. And with Colorado reaping from the additional windfall from taxes chances are they may just turn a blind eye to this, but this makes me recall images of legal dispensaries in California being raided by the DEA. 
What really pisses me off is that industrial hemp seed is illegal to import on a federal level and will be confiscated by Customs, yet the State is considering buying seed from Ukraine as a way to deliver 'aid' to the puppets they installed: 
The first sentence says it all, therefore its not hard to believe that industrial hemp seed is a scarcer commodity than high-grade weed or BHO in Colorado.

This isn't to belittle you, but if you cannot grasp something like cold wallet storage, how can you understand matters such as side-chains, colored coins, etherium, master protocol even the blockchain itself or the myriad of other uses for crypto? This is where the really fun is anyway, watching the price like some pseudo day trader pales in comparison. (And their returns are never as good as hodling anyway.)
I think you're doing yourself a great disservice for discounting your intelligence, and dismissing these critical aspects due to the steep learning curve. 
Coinbase is better than most exchanges in terms of storage, most of it is stored offline/cold storage, but since they hold the private keys you have missed the point of bitcoin altogether: being your own bank!
Decentralized solutions are the underlying goals of crytpo-cypher punk-crypto anarchist movement; what you seem to want is a paypal clone by the sound of it.

But the fact that the Kremlin keeps putting money into creating a rather strong team of journalists together reporting from all over the World makes me think he is either the height of arrogance or he's just a massive imbecile. 
I mean remember that one girl from RT America that resigned on Air? That was like a complete soap opera/circus, with both sides showing how low they were willing to go; I honestly haven't watched RT ever since, I will catch a headline in their print media section, but I have found better sources for my current focuses for now. That may change later, but I haven't had a need to do so as of yet.

You need to look further than your current sources of information then; when you rely mainly on an enclosed system for your animals diet you offset not just uncessary expenses and inputs but overcome what you have just mentioned by almost 90%; the 10% being that arable farm land is always a finite resource.
Look into how biodynamic animals, speciffically cows, are raised and come back with a better overview and I'll try and fill in what may be missing regarding your 'miniscule difference.'
Also, try and get your hands on some if you can and see if it tastes the same as GMO corn fed beef you get from conventional farms. The differnce is night and day if you any sembelance of a pallet.

I wasn't sure on the exact figure and I'd like sources on that figure, but lets assume that is the case; I'll ask how much of your economic growth, wages and employment figures are derived from the banking and lending practices from having such large reserves of CHF, most of it from foriegn clients? 
And lets ask the obvious question in terms of reserves, your currency only holds the value that it does because of the reputation from its banking sector, your maunfacturing, agriculture, property value and goods/services sector combined could NEVER maintain the purchasing power that it has if it were to rely on its merits alone; thus the value of your currency would plummet in respect to the current monoliths if it were measured on them alone: USD, EUR, CHY JPY. (LA County alone has a larger GDP than all of Switzerland and Tokyo, not even all of Kanto, is over double its size!)
This would cause an influx in the stanrdard of living, because even now (I left in June) if you solely look at the purchasing power in terms of its abilty to exchange goods/services it becomes clear that the CHF when used locally cannot offer your ability to 'be just fine' in any capacity.  
Lastly, with Switzerlands 2 largest trading parteners (EU and US) continuing to play legilative hardball on this matter, what will become of what relatively small but expensive exports you do have? A devalutaion of the CHF (worse than the EUR to CHF peg) would put a lot of people in poverty there due to the high cost of living, and it may be kept afloat due to Switzerland's lofty social programs and large reserves of CHF in the short term but in the long run you will find yourself in the same pre-1940's living standard. An increase in export prices would make it untennable due to German counterparts for about +50% of most goods/services Switzerland provides.
Its not so simple, and I haven't even got to the most dire of scenarios in my view: agriculture and energy and the subsequent implications that come from its absence. 
With that said, I have every confidence the Swiss people are intellegent and see the writing on the wall which will help them diversify in a strategic and effective manner to the best of their ability, as I have seen it and worked with them to do so; whether the State does is another matter eniterly and that unfortunately has severe consequences.

Surely one can accept the risk of such an undertaking when dealing with less than 1% of daily turnover or profit, I consider this no different than a hedged investment; *risky...* perhaps in some peoples eyes but assuming said investors and shareholders are given full disclosure I cannot see such a dire downside to it with such a low risk-high reward incentive structure especially when you see the metrics of gains made when simply holding btc for periods longer than 6 months. This is no different than a business diversifying its savings or investments to maintain a net positive cash flow, especially during periods with volatile fiat rates if dealing with international commerce. 


There are countries which have no tax liabilities/VAT for bitcoin, Slovenia comes to mind, so it can be a net positive for the businesses' net cash flow; but to be honest, I was actually focusing on 1 man start up, because as you clearly stated when you start dealing with larger institutions, this can pose a much larger liability as a moving target for the State's henchmen: tax man. And in the US, which is where many businesses in bitcoin are likely to be, bitcoin taxation still relies by and large on self-reporting. So, I stand by my position.

Merchant adoption and VC money may play a part, but I'm of the opinion that its actually the culmination of the underprivlidged-disenfranchised and those that pissed off at banks et al coming an understanding of the underlying mechanics of bitcoin; which may be coming in waves. 
But, who knows... or cares, if you're looking at the price as indication of Bitcoins (yes, Capital B) success, it showa just how myopic your views really are. The technology and what it affords is the revolution, not how much shit you can buy on your phone with 'magic internet wizard money.'

This reminds me when I arrived to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro last year at mid day and the ATMs were turned off, out for lunch apparently; I came back 2 minutes before 5pm after work and they shut them off, too.
I was so fucking mad I went to the local whatever bank across the street and was ready to pull out my money with fees, then I thought about it and bought bitcoin instead. 
I'd say local bitcoins is the best option for what is immensely slow adoption of bitcoin in Italy--I know, I was trying to rally up support for it in Emilia Romanga that has a history of anarchism (of sorts) with the 'Partigiano' history, but I was still turned away as a mere hustler of wares.

And I think you might be intrested in this:
I'm not trying to dismiss your efforts, far from it, its just that pedagogy's methods is not the only way in which a child learns; in fact I'd go so far as to say its the least effective form of it--especially since its 19-20th century roots (modern formal education) as I mentioned is built upon an archiac caste-warrior nation system to serve the needs of large fascist industrial oligarchs.
If I'm honest I'd prefer to see them procuring tools and equipment and gain practical work experience to empower them in order to lift themselves out of poverty through a craft or vocation that they can implement in the next 2-3 years (typical time for an apprenticeship) than to dedicate any resources to what is essentially a useless piece of paper that denotes their 'basic' aptitude according to some abritrary rurbric--and how many children possess the same piece of paper with no employment prospects in India? 
India needs more farmers, which is why I stood up as soon as I could to your fellow countrymen's dillema given what atrocisties Monsanto-Syngenta has commited there--I think these children would be ideal candidates for it, and if they want to learn about biodynamic or organic agriculture I'd like to help as much as I can. Obviously  coders devlopers would be ideal given our mutual intrests in cryptology but even textile workers would be a suitable trade as well in my opinion. 
In short: schooling is not the answer. I say as a health scientist with the honor letters, and letters of recomendations I recieved in my undergraduate and as person who is now actively involved with people from MIT and Caltech; its simply not worth dedicating any resoruces into the old economical model, so why should we send the most finite and essential one of all: human capital.

*But I'd like to see some trading volume numbers just in case, scour the blockchain txs since Fridays 'dip' and get back to us.*
I just think the market is functioning in the way that it does anytime big merchants come on board, it seems to be that BTC price is always altered by new *major merchant adoption; which makes sense if you think about it since these merchants (Dell, Alienware, Expedia, etc...) use coinbase/bitpay to convert their sales to fiat on a daily basis.
Either way I'm not worried about the fluctuation, just sad I cannot buy more right now, though I really wish I could.

I think that is a superior model to Soundcloud's bitcoin adoption because while Pro Soundcloud is a cool thing to have, and kind of a new standard for music artists now its still not embracing what bitcoin can offer--a decentralized monentary system that can, by means of micro-payments, support a multitude of content from young artists in a profitable manner, thus further destabilizing the music industry gatekeeper's grasp on content.

That is perhaps the most contrived way of owning-holding gold and has so many obvious shortfalls; there was a saying back in the day regarding PM 'if you don't hold it, you don't own it.'

Do yourself a favour, if you still want gold buy from Amagi and hold on to it; if liquidity and divisibility become an issue, you'll soon realize the value/benefits Bitcoin has over PM. It is a worthwhile experiment that I myself have undertaken with silver; try spending both and see which is easier to convert to goods/services and draw your own conclusions.

Perhaps, but what is the harm in playing around with an interface that provided I dedicate sufficient time, research and patience will become my primary way to do bitcoin transactions? As you read above, no one is bothering to deposit funds to it, neither will I. 
Why should we discourage intuitive learning? I like immersing myself with a seemingly complex task(s), I can make mistakes (many at times) and learn from the process. I will also be able to appreciate the mechanics of a non-alpha version even more provided I know what some of the early bugs were.

Well, with a bit of careful planning you could have made it to a bitcoin meet up or used an ATM in either country, assuming you meant USD; but having been an avid traveler for the past 2 years I agree that is not always possible.
I agree, if I lived next to an international airport and had some free time I'd consider sitting with my laptop and coinbase account next to the fiat exchange kiosk; I'd also consider using lyft (or is uber that is currently a target) to get there and back and try to get drivers to accept bitcoin for payment. I had a similar experience in Switzerland and I gave some satoshis for one curious driver in addition to the fare. Hopefully he follows up and attends the meetups as suggested.

With the TPP being in the limelight World wide we should really be pushing the meshnet agenda while quite a large amount of people are listening. This worked with the anti-gmo movement, and that has taken off--relatively speaking, of course, but still a great success in my mind.

Bother? No, I don't rely or acquire my information solely from one source, and the fact they have a series of independent journalists (some who accept bitcoin, mind you) on the front line of revolutions/conflicts/uprising etc... makes me think there is some degree to impartiality in their reporting at least. What gets edited is another matter entirely, which is why I wish we can start a simialr platform for journalists to upload all their content, unfiltered, unedited Wikileaks style for public scrutiny for crypto. 
Igor's reporting on Ukraine on RT was biased at times, but the footage didn't lie, and much of what he said was actually being corroborated by what I found on Twitter feeds/sources from people on the ground in Maidan. Crimea was harder to swallow, of course, but that is why you do your own legwork. 
The fact that its state subsidized does bother me as an anarchist, but I'm also a pragmatist so I can overlook certain things if they aid in achieving my ends goals. 
It is disruptive technology, and both the US (State) and Russia (via RT anyway) have been relaxed about the matter, but I tend to ignore what the State does in these instances so its irrelevant to me. 
Where we're going, there will be no Russia, no US, no Nation-State. These will be minor footnotes in the annals of Human History, likely listed as 'The Dark Age.'

Well, I simply base my views on the studies and subsequent observations they had with alcoholics, whose ailments often stem from acutely severe or extended forms of abuse or trama, like many PTSD victims; and since alcohol is the most widly and easily accessible drug, it makes sense from a logistical viewpoint for either ailment. But since I have never had the actual patient data in front of me, I'm not a physician nor a clinical trial scientist I would be erring to inferr that LSD is absolutely superior, and not what I wanted to say. 
However, as a health scientist I do follow its progress in the medical field, so here is another [source,]( a more recent one, for why I made the petetion for itse use in the aforemtnioned study in addition to LSD's success in past studies--which the study bases its modeling from.
I want to highlight this portion in particular:
*Regarding the lasting effects of the LSD experience in alcoholics, investigators of one trial noted, "It was rather common for patients to claim significant insights into their problems, to feel that they had been given a new lease on life, and to make a strong resolution to discontinue their drinking." And investigators of another trial noted, "It was not unusual for patients following their LSD experience to become much more self-accepting, to show greater openness and accessibility, and to adopt a more positive, optimistic view of their capacities to face future problems."*
This is a follow up in [2013 from the aforementioned reasearch](
*The researchers found that lifetime use of psilocybin or mescaline and past year use of LSD were associated with lower rates of serious psychological distress. Lifetime use of LSD was also significantly associated with a lower rate of outpatient mental health treatment and psychiatric medicine prescription.*

My solution: No I don't. I can instead obtain a source of bitcoin from the local community/meetups which will adhere to my views and princples until a truly decetralized p2p exchange comes online. I don't have to implore or petition the State for acquiring crypto-currency, and even suggesting that as an option shows your level of ignorance on the matter entirely. 
Coinbase has yet to adress or justify their need to create a a digital fingerprint for its users with emperical data and metrics to support its use; in fact I had an indepth conversation with an employee of coinbase who admitted that it has failed to act as a true detterent for phishing and hacking into accounts as it has persisited since it implemented its use. Coinbase is trying to make in-roads with disruptive technology in the old paradiagm, and it has worked well for them thus far, but I cannot with good faith continue to support them. 


I blame Coinbase for choosing Market Share and Profits over resolve and conviction for what cryptocurrency was intended to do: give people financial freedom by means of decentralization. 
I'm sure I'm in the minority, but complying with State decrees to the detriment of its end users is such an affront to what Bitcoin repersents that it negates what they have done in terms of merchant adoption to me.

Why? 
If anything it makes perfect sense, California is the tech Capital of the World and the only annexed territory of the US (state) to actually be able to secede from the US without much of a drop in quality of life--if anything I would expect a significant rise in quality of life--given its economy; I think most sensible people know that the US is a drag on our lives, and one we can do without. And as I mentioned before, competing purpose-built currencies is ingrained in our very culture.
In fact I hope this encourages the secession movement to progress into something more than signing a petition that is ignored.

I found it some what insightful, albeit terribly biased and skewed with a banker apologist narrative pulling the strings the whole way through.
I recall about 90-95% of all the events spoken of in this video as I saw them unfold in real-time (vicariously), however, I find it astonishingly disingenuous to overlook the fact that two EU nations (UK and NL) demonized Iceland regarding Icesave--[the UK going so far as to put the entire nation on the Terrorist watch list]( simply stating that Holland and the UK took it upon themselves to make their bondholders and depositors whole is a lie to say the least. (Read: Landsbanki asset liquidation.)
Also, this is when I became acutely aware of how vapidly and how haphazardly anyone can be coaxed into the realm of 'Terrorist' when tyrants rein free; I found it to be as an equal badge of honor as being an 'Enemy of the State.'
As for 'foreign investment' what they really mean is banks, hedge-funds, the IMF, World Bank and various other cronies of the State asset-stripping a nation into destitution and subservience as they have in every other EU nation and in various US cities/counties/states. That is the last thing a resource-limited nation with a viable renewable energy model needs. 
Capital control can be overcome with crypto-currencies, albeit with some inherit dangers as this relies on p2p exchange via Localbitcoins/SatoshiSquare/meetups; and yet this is still a far superior alternative to what the EU, US and Japan have had to go through with since 2007 and the 90's in Japan. 10% unemployment wasn't even attainable during the 'boom era' in any of those nations, and has been hovering as high as +50% in Spain and in Greece. 
At the crux of this 'report' lies misinformation mixed with Statist propaganda, which make for a volatile mixture, but I like the fact that Brigitta and other locals spoke about the impotent measures and the subsequent failures of the State when even the harder (though correct) measures are taken. 
A State created problem cannot be solved by a State issued solution-edict: simple. Also the first hand experiences, where they recall the drunk like stupor and exuberance from living beyond your means is worth noting; viable assessments can only come from deep introspection and critical analysis of one's mistakes, inflation indexed loans are the subprime loans every penniless peasant in the US and EU were offered by banks--via predatory lending practices--and subsequently adopted in-mass despite their terrible contractual terms; teaser interest rates, poor valuations of credit worthiness, low to no down payment requirements and ultimately default rate history. Which made for the resurgence of neo-fuedalism and the age of perpetual debt peonage. 
While I didn't think much of Auroacoin, I now mourn it's death because if the sentiment is truly to join the EU (almost an 180 degree spin leading up to and during the crisis up until 2010--2011) it would have at least put perspective on the underlying value and fundamentals of cyrpto-currencies as a whole when assessing this whole matter.

Pretty cool to see that logo on a lower formula car, and someone here with a graphics art background should make him a proper livery, as that looks poorly executed--reminds me of Chandok's old livery on a HRT. 
He has a cool story, and I'm not quite sure how he currently pays for his racing since he arrived to HK as the story doesnt divulge any details; unfortunately this is all too common in high end motorsports: promising talent relegated to an obscure formula-category because he doesn't have backing from a big corp/bank. 
The sad thing is he is already too old to go much further in today's World of high-end motorsports. If you're not even in GP2, and getting points on regular basism by late teens or 21 at the latest its almost impossible to get a seat in F1. The days of your Nigel Mansels or Damon Hills is long gone and the 21st century narrative is dominated by headlines of young proteges with WDCs: Hamilton, Vettel etc... 
Corporate sponsorship is also reserved soley for them these days, and subsequrently any legacy driver's offspring with some level of promise to increase sales/profits or being pay-driver linked to a corp with deep pockets (Nakajima).
Hopefully he branches out and does some GT racing, and maybe a even a GumBall or something if an early adopter sponsors him with a better car. Motorsports is seen World-Wide with deep market penetration in North and South America, Asia, Europe and Australia, unlike BItpay's college footbal bowl or Dogecoins Nascar which are all US centric.

Anyhow, here is an article that speaks about the sale practices and rift between the new Ferrari with someone who has actually sat down with LdM himself several times:
As for the firing of your friend, I think the exclusiveness of others posting pics of cars is where they had to draw the line; I'm not sure why, but with all the 'I just picked up my new XXX from the dealership' on youtube, along with all the unboxing crap you see I guess they had to do it.

Agreed, intrinsic value became the argument rather than simply a vital point to re-enforce the argument to explain why PM is superior to X; it became cyclical and obtuse to the degree where I, a silver 'bug,' completely withdrew from the narrative completely.
Its insane to me that Peter can still hold this position since Europac accepted btc, and I'm even more surprised we're still discussing why his opinion is even relevant.
And I think you're generalizing far too much when you speak of 'goldbugs,' by contrast Lew Rockewell, an equally famous PM guy and an overall far more insightful person, has been advocating bitcoin from the beginning; do you know why? Because he actually does believe in Hayek's theory of competing currencies, how Markets function, while Schiff merely pays lip service to it when its convenient to his objectives. Just as his anti-gov stance was torn to shambles after his failed campaign for Senate. The list goes on...
Its like I said, enough is enough. Lets not speak of him until Europac is willing to pay dividends/profits/gains in either btc or PM to its customers, until then he adds nothing to this space with his poorly formulated rebuttals and half-truths of Free Market Capitalism.

I worked and lived in Maranello and regularly hosted guys from the Ferrari factory, I even got to meet the ex-mayor of Maranello (the Biggest tifosi and Space exploration fan I have ever met) who has strong ties to Enzo and the Ferrari family itself before the WWII; he let us hang out at his house, gave us the VIP tour around town and we got to test his personal battery of Balsamic vinegar and even gave us some of his 10.000 euro/L award winning stuff. (It was awesome on ice cream, btw!) I even used the Ferrari simulator in the town center, it was wonky and cut  in-out and I was out 10 euros. :(
I have never heard of such a policy, with the exception of the Ferrari FXX(K), and maybe the 599xx. These are race track only version of road version cars, which is why they keep them in the factory. 
During the peak of the Ferrari-Alonso era they hit the record sales/profitability, but according to the guys we hosted, Ferrari were trying to sale to anyone who had the cash, which was/is diminishing as the crisis grew deeper. Which is probably why Chrysler-Fiat got involved in the way that it had and then did it what did: got rid of Lucas di Montezemolo, and his 'elitist' sales practices .
It was a funny experience working in the fields, and choosing my vegetables/fruits for the menu I would prepare that evening while hearing the La Ferrari blaring up and down the mountain. As that was being tested that year. It looked even more menacing in bare carbon fiber, btw. 
Lamborghini is supposed to have an even more friendlier corporate culture, one of the guys had worked for both Lamborghini and Ferrari and I being the only one actually into motor-sports would regularly chat him up during dinner; I can't go into details, but VW have worked hard to re-shape their hyper-car division and that doesn't seem in line with their ethos of trying to out-sale the actual Italian brands. Even the Veneno, the fastest most expensive Lamborghini, is a street legal car.

Contrast that with what Nastasia (and her team of other on-the-ground Ukrainians did with the approx 6.5 bitcoins that have been donated to date:
Even if they didn't steal them, taking them from people donating in the name of humanitarian aid and then retaining them and then subsequently doing nothing with them when there is such a great need and a great deal of human misery is just as bad; this was another PR stunt by prominent Bitcoin Foundation members. Nothing more. 
I was dubious of their motives then and I've been reluctantly proven correct. 
I'll PM Nastasia in hopes she can update what has been done since the last update. 
But in the mean time please consider [donating]( to them as, despite the unwarranted fear mongering, the funds have been proven to be used to feed people, buy generators and pay for medical costs for the injured in Kiev and NOT purchasing arms or weapons to further foment destabilization in the region--that is conducted by the US/EU and it's puppet IMF-appointed government.

Memory will be your biggest expense, flash or external HDD if you have any laying around it lower costs, but as I found out, SD media is so slow when trying to dl the entire blockchain and can kill a card--my bitcoind was out of synch for the past 5 months or so. The read-write speeds suck on SD, too; so I'd avoid it if possible and I think your budget allows for it if you plan accordingly.

So, while I wanted to see what Coinbase could do under the pressure of a competitor, I can't see Circle as competitor any longer.

It started with the US/IRS [closing Switzerland's oldest bank Wegelin]( and UBS paying fines, which were incurred by the Swiss. Now the vultures are circling the corpse that is Swiss banking. 
The EU (Germany and France) have been pushing hard for transparency and have even released the names of EU politicians with Swiss bank accounts to add to fuel to the fire amongst the masses.
Switzerland really needs to diversify their position and start buying large land lots in S. America, E. Europe or Africa and the human capital to ensure their food supply/oil/mineral/precious metal mining if they want to even have a chance of maintaing their standard of living in the next 10 years--I used to think it was more like 25 but its becoming more and more clear that time is not on their side. 
There are plenty more offshore havens in Asia and the British isles, Switzerland really only had their reputation and location in mainland Europe going for them. (And the former is tarnished beyond repair now.) And while crypto is a plaything of the technoraty in Switzerland for the most part, and becming a hub for incorporation, I think adoption may well see a blip now that their assets are on the line more than ever.

Why exactly? I'm not trying to trying to be a dick, but a nation not beholden to the USD and one that uses a currency with a high(er) inflation rate like say the Argentian peso or the Ukranian hryvnya is the 'ultimate experiment.'

I just happend to turn on RT and this interview was on; the host, or perhaps her script writer, are very pro-Bitcoin. They seem to be strong advocates of it from the beggining of this show as I recall watching the first few weeks when it came looking for a Capital Account replacement and they were opening segments with how the Blockchain was posied to help finance.

Very interesting, I will look into this more closely. But, can I just say that this is what is most exciting about Bitcoin for me: seeing the community respond to and spotanouesly create a decentralized approach to rival the VC and Wall street 'regulated' entities for buying/selling in BTC. 
Would you consider intergrating a DarkMarket-OpenBazzar approach to an exchange on this platform? Like pooling all the Local bitcoins, Mycelium trades in order to cash in-out of BTC... Just wondering.

Cool, it is an awesome proof of concept of an efficient decetralized platform, that if/when properly utilized can get us away from so many 'X Exchange was hacked and ran off with my money.'
It won't ever entirely do away with it, but if it catches on it does atply highlight the benefits of decentralized trading platform that emphasizes Bitcoin's greatest strength: It's Community. 
It is for this reason--amongst others regarding privacy--why I simply refuse to buy from CB or Circle; sure that is the path of least resistence, but that convenience comes at too great a cost. 
At a meetup you get yourself a drink, shake some hands, talk crypto maybe share some jokes and negotitate for a buy/sell in the most Free Market we have to date; thus reminding us what commerce was really meant to do: bridge gaps amongst human beings for mutually benefical outcomes in the most peaceful manner.

I'm not sure that is it; we welcome competition in the Market, which requires you to have a sound business model, this ongoing saga just revealed that: crypto nerds =/= CEO material. 
This venture always carried risk and rewards, and for a while Trezor had a monopoly, which is terrible, then came Bwallet and disrupted their monopoloy. And now Trezor isin damage limitation/control while Bwallet just got a bunch of free PR.
We thrive in a competitive enviourment, but personally speaking I was waiting for some to review the code before buying a Bwallet and now that a supercookie has been discovered I'm going to contiue to wait for airbitz to implement multi-sig for a hotwallet. 
I've lost my appetite for hardware wallets entirely, as I'm used to running qt, which is far from ideal, but is actually the way Bitcoin was meant to be utilized: securely and private.

Except when it takes CB days to clear unless you have a Credit Card on record, and CB decides to cancel your order under some presumed 'flag' 4 days into your waiting period or they run out of coins and lock you into a price when they 'do have more'... or abruptly put a nice 10+% premium above Bitstamp. Or their lack of Customer Support (especially during ATH) that forced them to dedicate a subreddit to complaints. Or God help you if you decide to change phone numbers for 2fa, they (or 3rd party service) demand Gox level of info on their customers before even considering it. Or play(ed) on Satoshidice...
(Circle isn't even worth mentioning: use it at your own peril.)
Then you realize its hardly convienent; I accetped all the above (absurd on my part) as a startup having growing pains but known to bring big names into the ecosystem, but it was the security issue that finally broke the camels back: that is unacceptable and the antithesis of the whitepaper and ideals behind cryptocurrency-cypherpunk philosophy.

I thought so too when it came out, but these guys beat them to the punch and in crypto that tends to be the nature of things and we relsih the devs for it:
I need to wait until they actually supprt Linux to use it, but I have seen a demo a while back. We need to get the guys behind both in an Etherium vs Bithalo panel Q&amp;A session. I didn't buy any ether, and do not plan to, but 30k BTC and nothing to show for it to date thus far is not exhibiting the qualities of an efficent-decentralized startup. 
Dark Market did many things, chief amongst them was set the standard for how things should be made and then developed on top of that so the UX gets better with time with testnet coins, instead of having some buggy software come out after a year or two. 
I think, and fear most people bought etherium waiting for them to explode in value, which has proven time and again, that alt(s) market are fucking a bloodbath in terms of ROI. 
Edit: Spelling!

Depends by what you mean 'go anywhere,' really. But here are some threads on it:
My guess is for the unintiated or uninterested it probably went straight to the book store if they used it all--though $100 didn't go far when I was in University so doubtful it goes far there--or sold it to smarter people at a discount. Those interested in it showed up in those threads and got involved in some capacity since that took place. 
As mentioned before, it achieved getting some of the smartest people with access to the some of the best Labs and resources in the World interested in crypto. 
This, in conjuction with the 3 round pitch, made it one of the highlights of 2014; potentially it will start to pay dividiends in the near future as innovation advances from these guys. 
I personally want and have been activly trying to get Caltech get in this space and eventually colloborate with these guy at MIT on similiar pitch for seed money as MIT's crypto club still holds quite a few funds and said they will reserve them for future hackathons/pitches etc... I'm still trying to make that happen in what spare time I have, but its proving harder the closer I get to it finally happening.

So a crude logistical roadmap:
We have an online stream source, we have pre-show entertainement, we have all 3 of those aforementioned accepting Bitcoin so no 3rd party has to collect/hold funds for them; so now we just put it all together and have an invite system and host the show. (The only real question that is pestering me is the best way to verify payment to send out the invite/links?)

We can screen this, the Danish documentry, and have 3-4 back up links of the Oscars.

Absurd, yet ultimately un-enforceable laws; I'd like to see them raid a bitcoin meeting for 'misuse of mobile phones' or 'mathmatical impropriety.' I think the State said they are allowed to mine them, just not conduct or transact in them, or something equally as stupid. 
They still have a wrecked currency, and stagnating standards of living after the crisis in 2008. And while they are better than many EU member states, its far from resolved. (Further proving why Iceland should never even consider going to the EU.)
Now, Capital Controls (in fiat) that is another story, those are real and tyranical to their core.
Auroracoin was tragic, but foreseeable; it could of done so much more even if its worth was only in the cents in terms of getting people used to programable currency, especially those eager to opt out of the States aforementioned oppressive Capital Controls. I'm also wondering why mining hasn't gotten even bigger there, though I'm glad it hasn't as it would give Bitcoin's decentralized maxim a point a failure.

So true... I can't think of a better solution for what creates legitmacy more than being the presence amongst slurpees, slim jims and glow in the dark condoms.  
Seriously, though, gift cards are already available from Gyft; and while I'd like to see them at a 7-11 if I had to chose I'd prefer easier to see more easy and secure wallets for noobs and smart contract services/2.0 technology than some throw back to what worked back in 1999 for The Gap's market startegy. 
Then again, who didn't go out and buy khaki's back then, right?

Agreed. 
This is the way they wanted to gain legitmicy, by compromising ourselves and introducing the legacy's 'big dicks' and their [blood money]( in order to comply and expand. 
While I have vested interest in seeing Bitcoin-Crypto's presence expand as far as it can go, I have for the first time been taking a greater look at alt-coins now as a result, does anyone have a link to Darkcoin subreddit, the most obvious (r/darkcoin) one is private. 
Many may say they are digging their own graves, but I'm not so sure its that cut-dry. I think we are in the co-opt phase and that our tools (exchanges) will be used against us in order to de-stabalize what has been a resilient hotbed of innovation; disruptions in Mt Gox and Bitstamp have proven to be the best way to make the price drop and create substantial losses (in fiat terms) for projects or businesses holding BTC, thus curtailing the projects viability and compromising its investment/outlay's purchasing power for daily expenses.
With so many using Coinbase, and their open stance on 'regulatory compliance' they are the perfect target, and as Bitstamp has proven even in 2015 centralized exchanges are still a major kink in Bitcoin's armour.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:31:29
**Caveat emptor**
I think we all have had our crash-burn moments. The internet and crypto, however, is making it a public spectacle. Which I have mixed feelings about, but I ultimately see it as an overall good as it facilitates itself as a source for information for those who seek it and wish to learn from it; *smart men learn from their mistakes; wise men learn from other's mistakes.*
It's natural for one to expound about the idealism of the Free Market, it's another thing to understand it and actually be an active particpant, and its an even greater feat to excel within it.
I see this as more of a lack of investment acumen and experience, if you can call *investing in cryptos* that, why would you not have some diversity to hedge against future losses--there will always be losses--and spread your risk across?
I'm affraid this is why I don't really care much for alts, besdies the few with some what novel atrributes (Darkcoin) they are the killing fields for pump-dumpers. That isn't to say they shouldn't exist but if when holding/investing (crypto is by and large a poor investment instrument) they certainly have significantly more drawbacks than BTC. 
With that said, it is sad to see; but if Pancake is reading this: cut your losses and learn from it, start over again and come back smarter and stronger: that is the best thing you can do. 
Hey, at least the suicide hotline number isn't a 'thing' in crypto anymore.

I intitally had huge reservations about getting wall street idiots and hudge fund types into the space--in the name of liquidity of all thing--as I knew they would buy huge and leverage their position to fuck around with the price, but if that means coins are being directed and used by those with greater resolve and capital then so be it. 
Perhaps its misguided, but I think the get-rich-quick types are just learning what it means to Bitcoin. So the them:

If you want incentivise people running full nodes, forget micro-payments and just sponsor them to buy the equipment [like I did here. (One should be up and running soon with a possibility of another two later on.)]( 
Early adopters should be the first step up, seeing as how they have the most to gain from securing the network. 
McM was fucking lame and instead of honouring their discount like they should have they backed out with some made up excuse about fixed prices; [only to later find out when I tested it, whilst logged into my account, they offered me a 10% discount to complete my purchase.]( 
Another suggestion is to use purse.io to buy the necessary memory media to run a full node on amazon, so what starts off as a ~$75 node, drops down to like $40-50, the savings can be seen as the costs of maintain the node (bandwidth, Bitcoin updates etc). 
I suggest we get a (**decentralized version!!!**) Tipping Tuesday like situation where people offer to offset some of the expenses of running a node. We all have the desire to secure the network, especially with 21's ambitions of mining centralisation, with no mention of nodes mind you, and all this talk about 20Mb block hard fork. 
Micopayments are meant for tips for Original Content and Meshnet bandwidth, not nodes; the up-front costs and effort of running one are more than your casual or the uninitiated are going to even consider, unfortunately. And the advent of sending 22 cents isn't going to change that, whether we like it or not.

The documentry? There were limited screenings earlier last year, and there was a screening at the CCC last month, but was not broadcast on the stream. 
In short, it was a limited screening, and they [even got by from some statist.]( I'm not sure if this is going straight to DVD or what Poitras has planned, I wished she had made the the Q/A session at the CCC available, so we could have asked about a dvd release date or even better have her torrent it and accept btc for it like the Rise and Rise of bitcoin. 
So in summary: no source as of yet, but that may change as screeners are often leaked for nominated films in the scene; though, that may change if Poitras and crew follow through on a PPV torrent or something.

Fringe here, can confirm: what I did was just let my account lapse, my credit card linked to this account expired and I never renewed it and I cannot actually login anymore so I can't actually close it. 
But if I could I would have... a long time ago, actually; it all began when I realized digital fingerprints and crypto currency do not mix, regardless of how many merchants they brought on board you have lost the point of what we are doing here and it was exmplified when they started shutting down accounts for (alledgedly) using gambling websites. It was a total 'go home and re-think your life' moment. They made their choice and we as a community should of responded in kind but convenience has and will always be the best lemming-trap of the masses, as the post-snowden era has shown us. 
Its a crude but apt simplification of where we are still in 2015, 6 years after the genesis block: convenience or security; **choose ONE**.
Maybe this is me waxing lyrically about yore (2011), but this community saw walled-gardens as the bane of progress and something we actively challenged at one point, so after 4 years being in this community I know the numbers have shrunk but we're still out here 'putting our money where our mouth is' and doing it the 'hard way.'

Ok, wil do; but the current state of affair in Colorado, before September's harvest, was that many farmers were actually still getting denied access to legacy banking and some were actually having their account frozen or closed entirely.
The repeal process required 'proof of financial disress' and 'wrongful termination' that ultimately was at the discretion of the Federal Reserve to approve or deny. Its financial censorship, no different than Wikileaks.
This is personal and cuts deep as I have vested interest in this in more ways than one; I even have a clumsy sort of work-around but it requires 'boots on the ground' and refinement so if anyone here is interested in making this happen and works to colloborate that would be awesome as I, at best, won't be able to get out to Colorado until May of this year if I find funidng for Operating Capital for my operation.

I like Tesla and what they are doing these days, but its history is a dubious one, especially if you believe in Free Markets and are against Government intervention--2007/2008 marked a low point in US auto manufacturing, Tesla didn't do itself any favors by taking the DOE loan for initial runway. 
You can say all you want about paying it back ahead of schedule, just as GM tried to spin, but the fact remains that is what happened to get it where it is today. And who here would touch a Volt? (Any of GM's worthless cronie-capitalism lineup for that matter?)

I was about to say that this all seems like a red-herring and we are losing persepective of what is really at stake here; blame Karpeles all you want, but the Drug War has been the bane of many of the World's ills and has made many capitulate to the State when 'affiliated' with its trafficing, all while the CIA has been running drugs out of South America and the Middle East for decades...
A part of me wants to see Karpeles burn for being the bane of the Bitcoin comminty for years now, and if what you wrote is in fact emperically true, I'd like to see hang for being a traitor State accomplice. But I just have an unnerving feeling this is merely tapping into the Bitcoin community's rage after the final GOXXING to allow us to comply with their will: legitmize the State's power, through the use of plausible and emotionally charged scenarios. 
I don't know... this was a complete mindfuck, and easy to get lost in, but still I'm not losing perspective of what is really at stake here: the Natural Right(s) as Human beings to be free and have liberty absent of any nation-state's decrees.


[Ever heard of rendition camps?]( The State doesn't need permission to take anyone in the middle of the night, there are quite a few in Europe (and the rest of the World, really). And Japan is essentially just another post-WWII US colony with bases everywhere, don't think the US justice system kept him out of harms way, it was clear the fucker made a deal when he wasn't extradited right away and kept fucking around on Twitter and reddit.

Try not to tip less than $0.50 USD, we don't want to spam them with tips that would otherwise go ignored: think how useless and annoying the Enjoy_Sochi dust was in terms of value, chances are they will view like that as well.
Genre specific Monikers welcomed!
Post proof of the tx and comment of the tip here, if you wanted to tip an artist but it was already done, consider tipping the guy/gal who did before you with small(er) amount and choose another artist.
Lastly, lets try and entice artists without Sounclouds to make them by tipping them teaser amounts with monikers and comments on there Facebook/Twitter/Youtube channels.
It's 7am in Europe, and I will be dropping a tip every 30 minutes until I run out of money.

No, we're leaps and bounds beyond where we were back then in just that respect alone. But, I agree that post-scarcity is still far off, and will require a radical change in the Human condition. But, taking steps such as these are a critical component; allowing people to free up there time to focus on pursuits that they deem necessary and are passionate about is the best we can do for the next generations.

I had to search what Trust even was, as I don't have any ETH... but for starters it supports BTC?
Also Liquid, this is a blockstream thing only; read the article and decide for yourself if its something for you. I'm not a trader but I want to see what applications and use-cases this has beyond just using as they described, tx times aren't really that big a of a concern after seg-wit. But I want to see what else it can do. 
Personally, I'm no longer a wallet maximalist; having different devices/wallets for different applications has been my norm for the past 4-5 years in BTC.

Rad, that hoop house is too small for any real cultivation, but you could have a starter/clone nursery in there with a couple 100 trimmings. With things like flowers, herb sprouts or citrus/fruit trees you could have over a 1000 worth of product in there.
Alternatively, cannabis plants could be in there too and have tens of thousands worth of clones.

I thought about that, too , actually. I thought they were Mainland money/apps only and required a Chinese social security number or something along those lines. 


This was my best guess, too, but even if were so those are cutting into their margins badly; what's the Baht to USD ratio? 20 cents/tx could be a huge loss in profits if so, especially if its a 2-hop intermediary taking fees all the way down.

Yeah, same arguments regurgitated every SINGLE time, and phrased in a way that 'anarchy' is some how a disaster to be avoided at all costs; despite them throwing around their weight around in the tech industry when it suited them, they fail to realize and acknowledge that [Burners-Lee created the very WWW, upon which tech like Bitcoin operates over, in an anarchic and decentralized manner]( It was meant to be permissionless.  (And this was a time that they themselves were old enough to see it occur.)
Subsequently, it has failed to live up to this criteria by the very creator(s) and we've all been made worse because of it. And yet, it has managed to be the main way we conduct commerce and transfer private information in the 21st Century.
It was these very handful of business entities that distorted this to their monetary gain to create a sophisticated and addictive panopticon most often funded by and at the behest of Nation-states.

I understand this argument, but I think its analogous to saying, 'yeah, well, I started with training wheels and they still work for me!'
BTC and crypto as a whole is such that once you start to buy in, or before in my case, you only have a vague overview of it, but as you learn more you begin to see just how vast it really is. So, much like your argument I can understand it was your first foray with purchases, but why don't you go to a meetup and try and buy some there? That's when you get a real idea of what this tech is really about, p2p money with no middle men was when I first realized this might actually be a worthwhile endeavor. 
If you think trying to re-enforce the the idea of what is on the White paper itself is overzealous, I would argue the issue is not with 'crypto idealists' but rather with a cohort unwilling to understand what it is they found themselves in.  
You're free to use whatever you want, but understand that Coinbase is essentially the antithesis of what BTC is about, and they're renown for doing unscrupulous things, so why not choose one of the many alternatives that have since come online since you started?

Actually he said he 'believed in her,' and her ability to dedicate her Life to Theranos to make it into what she had promised it could be, which is not the same. He did pay her, but if you're a billionaire and this is a lifelong family friend, what's a million if the upside of a moonshot pans out?
What I took away from that Doc is people bought into her narrative (female entrepreneur disrupting Big biotech/Pharma) more than the actual product itself and she was persuasive in extracting both financial as well as Human capital from so many that it can't be denied she was apparently good at it. How that was done, especially with that absurd voice, is beyond me; if you do any public speaking you can see some very obvious signs she was obfuscating a lot. Those eyes look a person who does a lot of amphetamines, too. I actually wanted to Watch Nightcrawler right after as she reminded me of that character so much, especially with those eyes.

If this quote was actually attributed to him, as I have seen it been linked to Tortsky too, it couldn't come from a more Mr. Burns like character who used the opaque nature of the monetary system to his advantage; he not only had factories in Germany but he openly collaborated with the SS to supply them with Raw Materials in the lead up to WWII. He even went so far as to let them have a majority share of his Factory to continue operations, while still collecting funds for its output and raw materials, as he was not deemed worthy as he wasn't German enough for his SS links, and name changes didn't help 'Ford-werke gmbh.'
This guy was a horrible Statist, he just played both sides, proving Capital has no allegiance to Country--as it should be--but, he's hardly a victim of the very same system he's denouncing in that quote. He's a war profiteer, and likely a treasnous one, at the time when ACTUAL US CITIZENS of Japanese blood were thrown into internment camps and stripped of their assets and property, and forced to send their children to War to prove their loyalty.
In fact, I wonder how much Market Share Ford was able to acquire after WWII precisely because Henry positioned himself to work/supply/collaborate with the SS and Nazis (who were socialist and were forceful in their control over the Deutschmark, mind you).
Most awesome modern car brands had links to Military armament: BMW, Mercedes, VW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Toyota, GM, Rolls Royce etc... But you'd be hard-pressed to hear those CEOs criticizing the very same monetary system that kept them afloat through those years. That and Martin Bormann, I suppose.

Ok, last response on this because I think i get your arguments core principal: Physics must be 'conquered' in order to achieve post scarcity. 
Wouldn't it be best to ensure that would-be physicist be allowed to undergo not just the basic education and training to make that happen, but also be allowed to experiment with the ability to place their theories in to practice? That requires they not be encumbered with just trying to survive. 
Anecdote: I studied a STEM degree in University, and I had to work through school and I can tell you right now that was the case for most for students from working class families. 
As a result we had little to no time to actually apply the skill sets we acquired from our schooling as our time was limited and constrained to class and work; for every class a non STEM student has we have to take 2 (lecture and lab) and often some sort of additional course to re-enforce what we 'learned' that leaves us with no time to explore and do independent research and often leaves us beyond exhausted--I used to have to stay up for 72 hours once a week just to get it all done. Every week of the term after the 2nd is a midterm, or lab practical.
This as a design is not healthy, nor is it productive if the outcome is to have a motivated, robust scientific talent pool to draw from to solve the ongoing challenges in the World, and not just some overworked, exhausted subservient working-poor-underclass. Unfortunately, academia has been churning out the latter  to the benefit of many entrenched Industries for decades now. 
Are you telling me that you don't think removing that barrier alone is a worth while to 'mastering' physics as you've described? Many of my colleagues didn't even get to work in the Industry for the degree they studied, some just opted to go to graduate school just because it was better to amass debt in a 'safe space' than try to pretend they actually got anything out of their undergrad because they were burned out by Junior year and just barely scraped by to graduate in 5 years. 
Again, I accept that this isn't a sure bet, I just think that this is a huge drag on overall Human progress. And just so its clear, I kind of wish most don't even have to go to University and [can instead do something like Boyan Slatt.](
I've never gone back to a lab after I paid my student debt, despite the fact that I got letters of recommendation and  was asked to join my biochem professor's lab as graduate student. 
Instead I moved on entirely and decided to make progress elsewhere, but anytime I spent time with fellow biologists they always say that I should return to the lab. And they think my Biohacking approach to Life is not the only thing I should be doing as they often say there are places in their labs for someone like me, but I simply refuse to go back.

I've been giving this some serious thought recently.
Did anyone ever think it would be possible to be involved in a movement where the most despised company in the ecosystem is still environmentally friendly and being rewarded to do so? One which is not only based in one of the most polluted areas in the World, but also one WITH cheap State-subsidized fossil fuel sourced electricity!
And yet its incentivized (monetarily) to act in an environmental manner of their own volition... if this isn't the most positively impactful form of social engineering we have created in the 21st Century, I really don't know what is; I'm of the firm belief that when this time in History is written, Bitcoin will have more than just a few footnotes about monetary tech disruption but instead a whole chapter(s) written about its implications in re-defining social structures and its shift into a more sustainable model, which rewards doing what is right!
I mean, fuck Jihan/Bcash and all that... but its still pretty amazing that stuff like this even happens. I just can't see how a Monsanto-Bayer, Nestle, DOW or Syngenta would turn around do anything similar in the fiat World, despite all the Global pressure, protests and hatred for them respectively or collectively.

One would argue that incentive has already been in place for decades with the welfare options in the US, UK and the EU; I think open borders are the sane thing to have as a species, but the displacement of people from war torn areas should be an issue the aggressor nation should have to deal with, not the citizenry who had no say in the matter.  
Moreover, the argument is based on the idea that all other forms of (wasteful) welfare services would be phased out in return for this and could be funded from that discretionary budget; I'd like to believe just not funding the pentagon and DoD with trillions would solve that issue and that of education, but that isn't the narrative that is being pushed here in regards to UBI, unfortunately. 
Persoanlly, I honestly would opt-out of my US based location if I could live in a less expensive area and be able to work without restriction in another country/continent with lower cost of living. I'd even split my UBI with anyone who could provide labour to an Industry of my choice (Aerospace most likely) and local community outreach for a net positive to help them re-locate if needed.

Wouldn't make sense to have Layer 1, which while secure, is way overkill for their needs and tx volume. LN is what Kroger is considering, who probably does as much if not more in revenue, than Starbucks.
I paid with crypto via a pull NFC system in 2016, their POS will have to be upgraded, the ingenico POS are horrible. They break down a lot, and even their chip readers will have to go. So why not roll out a better solution with out such a wear-tear POS system?
I only did it because I was trying out my own solutions for my clients, and never did it again: I went to Rite-aid, Natural Grocers, and McDonald's too. Crypto for retail purchases, while mildly interesting as a hurdle to overcome, has little to no novelty and can't really compete with the legacy system with the exception of an options when abuse of power from the likes of Visa/MC comes into play, if I'm entirely honest. And fees play a role in that. 
With that being said, I will say that I'm getting giddy seeing how Square and Cash App will have to integrate a product now more than ever due to the pressure this retail side demand is placing on them to deliver one.

So, there I was waiting for my payment from last nights bounty to confirm as I watched the neon lights march the next batch of marks to the robo-whores in the red district--to be fair, they looked liked they were just begging to have their organs stolen by the triads, so I didn't try to stop them. Suddenly, the craving and aroma of  oil and noodles sizzling on a hot pan hit me harder than Mcafee's meatbag fists punching the sky when he realized his dick was saved!
My stomach began to rumble like a Buick with a rotting tailpipe, the pulsating feeling moved all along my body eventually ending in my left wrist. My watch wallet showed 'confirmed transaction,' so I made my way to Auntie P's Noodle stand in the MBK food market, where she slings the meanest Pad Thai this side of 'BK.
When I got there a hapless PRC tourist was in line trying to bargain with Auntie P to take his worthless Wechat tokens, but she was having none of it and suddenly turned to her synth with a disapproving scowl--if Jin-yang would've stopped flailing his arms like an overdosed circus chimp for a second he'd smart-up and realize he was about 10 seconds away from having his clavicle broken in three places.
I scanned the qr code and ordered the regular just as I heard the sound of metal colliding into his torso tossing him into the backalley and hitting what sounded like every garbage can ever made in Thailand...

Oh, see, we drive completely differently you and I. I would have to swap pads every track event (often Kevlar) and my brake fluid (DOT 5) to boot as it was being pushed.
But, I also worked in the Industry in various sides, too. 50k miles on a normal ICE car is pushing it really far. Rotors are probably screwed and chewed up if you tried to make a pad last that long, as it would likely to its bare metal and shims by then.

Regenerative braking, the battery is charged by the car's kinetic energy recovery system when off the accelerator.
It's odd when you first step in the car, but after a while you're using rather intuitively.
So, while it does vastly decrease the need for brake pad replacement, you'll still use them up, though it would be totally reasonable for that to be something you only do like every 30-50k miles unless you're doing some serious braking. And with AP2 enabled commutes, maybe longer?
I drove a Tesla Model 3 Performance, and was taking it up to 130 in the turns (damn that thing handles and accelerates so well) and because of its regenerative system I was on the brakes only 20% of the time I would to stop for a turn.
Teslas really aren't cars, as we know them, it drives and handles like a rocket ship and has games and features inside like a smartphone with ridiculous stuff like AP2 and depending on the model you can make it dance--its really like a big toy!

What I meant was that if you do not have any Bitcoin, as is the case for most noobs (which is why the Coinbase argument is so pervasive around here and used to justify its existence) who use these services, then you are better off using Cash app for an easy on-ramp from fiat in every single facet from that POV.
Why? Because they do not require you to have Bitcoin to make a tx, like on Bisq, so you can purchase without opening a wallet elsewhere. Now, should you choose to redeem your funds for actual btc then you must provide KYC/AML info to then move your coins to an actual Bitcoin wallet address. Until that point you aren't really dealing with actual btc itself: your purchase is not on the blockchain, you do not have a bitcoin wallet, nor the keys to them.
Again, this is a noob friendly, and superior alternative to Coinbase.
Dorsey is actually helping fund/build the ecosystem, unlike Coinbase who has been the scourage of BTC since the downfall of Gox and some would argue before that, but there weren't any viable alternatives then to fill that gap, that no longer applies to our current situation.

I personally would even include the DOE in there, as it can be seen as nothing more than state sponsored child/teencare for a large percentage of the people who attended, and who would likely be better off dropping out at an early age after learning basics like arthritic, reading and writing and finding a trade or craft they could apply themselves to rather than waste their time and resourced in those makeshift prisons.
One could probably bring it up even higher if you removed Govt worker retirement, civil and military, but that would be a hard sale as its essentially political suicide, but that could bring it well over that I think. I hope Yang is cool with being the guy who could actually do that and all that entails as I doubt he care about a long term political career. He's an actually successful entrepreneur from what I recall from that interview on JRE. Apparently also has a background in Law, too.
This is why I detest the Nation state level approach to UBI, you have all these politicians who still manage to fund ULA's disaster (SLS) after SpaceX has been killing it with Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy and eventually Starhopper standing right in front of there face for a a lower cost per launch. 
The State isn't interested in the best, albeit more challenging, and most cost effective solution: it is at its very core a system of legalized theft for the benefit of the few.

Their motives are varied, but as we saw with JPM coin, their aim is to discredit BTC while trying to push their own agenda with the 'BTC is volatile argument.' 
I'm not convinced they aren't doing this at a profit, but I'll accept your analysis, if only for arguments sake... with that being said, I'm sure they were some of the biggest buyers of the US Marshall's sell off, as they've likely been buying since at least the 2013 price rise, and this was about the time of the bank to crypto brain drain, so this can still be done at a net profit if you've been in this long term. 
I agree that this price drop is a net positive thing, I just wish I had more fiat to convert, I bought all the way from 5k to 3k.

Good, GBP is perhaps the worst example of a fiat currency, perhaps more so than the USD: How the city of London alone has kept that thing afloat for so long through sheer manipulation of the forex market/stock market is fucking criminal.
The UK economy is so overvalued, and its currency valuation doesn't reflect its actual output or significance in the Global Economy. I estimated during the 2014 floods, when I lived there, that if it had to solely fend for itself it wouldn't be able to support its population for more than 10 months.

I could fill pages of text on this subject and talk for hours (as I have with people who have met me in person) on it as it as been the focal point of why I got into Bitcon in the first place... its taken me on a really long journey (going to be nearly 8 years in August) and its a highly complicated system that warrants a lot of consideration depending on who and where you're operating from: I did this on 2 Western continents and about 12 countries.
Suffice it to say, is that unless you're in a dire situation like Ukraine, Venzuela etc... fiat (cash) just works better in every conceivable way for the end user and the merchant, when you add credit cards into the mix is when you start to see the stark realities and negative consequences (fees, delays, chargeback etc...). 
But even then, most people are set in there ways and don't have the time or resources to dedicate to learning how to operate yet another complicated variable to get paid. Also, bitcoiners aren't concerned with buying veg on a regular basis with their funds. There are exceptions, of course, but on a whole most merchants can't sacrifice the time or resources--especially if they are also the gardener/farmer--to even consider it if it only brings in a few extra bucks to the weekly revenue.  I've seen it from all sides of the supply chain and I can appreciate this perspective for what it is and have come to accept it.
However, Bitcoin with a easy to operate UI/UX LN channel can in turn help with those shortfalls, but if you're talking about just on-chain use for your 26 dollars worth of weekly veg at the farmers market or grocery store, its simply overkill and not really useful in a society with a semi-functional economy.
This is why we should be doing everything we can to get kroger to accept, its hard to think of a better pilot test for LN than them and its amazing when one considers what this could do for overall tech adoption for such goods/services as they own tons of chains throughout the US.

What really should have happened is rather than waste money on a train from LA to SF that went no where, it should have been spent to create infrastructure to refill the depleted and emptied aquifers throughout CA during these 2 past rainy seasons.

That was fun, it drew me into it with an almost early Tarentino-esque flow. It was really well shot, too. 
By the end I somehow felt like I had my emotions played with like with like with an episode of Black Mirror. That's rare.
Sucks about SXSW, but from the coverage I saw of this year's event, its no where near as good as it was these last 2 years. So, maybe it was for the best?
With that being said, I've been playing with this Black Mirror inspired pilot/script for several years now. I just add pages to the script when I get the urge to write--I was going to last night, in fact, but decided to focus on a cyberpunk/Tech Noir thing I play around with instead when [I saw this post](

It should, though we didn't use electrum; that's what my startup offered to clients who wanted to operate at Farmer's markets or in BnM without knowing how the tech worked at all with no real downside to the device being lost or damaged. If you got the BTC-fiat side solved you're already 60% of the way done in my view.


You're preaching to the choir, dude; except for me it was elderly (50+) hemp farmers and merchants. :) That's why I think Mycelium is so good, its so simple to use.


Sure, but I'm with Dorsey in thinking it should be a BTC thing only especially now with LN being a core part of the  CASH app; the problem with this is mainly regulatory compliance and tax accounting minutia, things I'm not willing to care about at this point and would rather Square take on and then bring my experience and skill set to them in order to roll this out for either businesses and restaurants or small business owners. Its one of the reasons why I created my startup in the first place.
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:31:47
And this is exactly why Cash/Square should take all of Coinbases marketshare once an for all and render them obsolete, this shouldn't even be a question anymore when people say 'why should I bother migrating,' its very clear now. 
I honestly don't see the parallels between his work in BTC and that of Twitter, which is (mostly?) governed by a series of board members and execs, lawyers etc... From what I recall in his interview on JRE it was him and an Engineer that just hacked away when they first launched that pilot to test to accept payment in BTC and convert it to fiat. 
Also, I think its very clear that social media by its very nature is toxic and has perverted the way people communicate, it amplifies and embeslishes the most negative parts of the Human condition and normalizes them by sheer numbers. SJWs brigading are only one component, albeit cancerous, of that equation; what is really at the crux of this is this disgusting tribalism and antagonism for its own sake in hopes of filling the void of their otherwise pathetic and vapid existence. This is far more pervasive than we care to think about Humanity in its current stage, and its not dependent on Myspace/Twitter/Facebook/WeChat etc... 
Blaming Dorsey for all of the ills that take place at Twitter is shortsighted, as he was clearly unaware of half the stuff that was done on Twitters behalf as you could tell in the first interview; in many ways I personally think his efforts with Square and Cash are re-kindling why he cared about the Internet at all: just like him I discovered the trove of Crypto-anarchy and Cypherpunk on newsgroups, which opened my eyes to what the World could be like... and from personal experience I can tell you that takes a certain type of person to do that and it sure as hell isn't a censorship tyrant type.

I feel like I'm getting trolled, but: You do realize that this cheap hydroelectric boost is due to the rainy season in that part of China, right?  
That means that they're harnessing the energy already afforded to us by Nature, demand of said energy could be zero, but it still exists and luckily there is infrastructure in place to harness these resources. 
These 'no-coiners' you speak have no logical basis to their argument, because in this case: supply (electricity generated due to seasonal rain  increase) created demand, rather than demand (mining) creating supply.

Pretty much, just look at SV's issues with housing; they won't bother to alleviate that despite the immense traffic congestion, and subsequent air quality issues, homelessness, poverty etc... even as it would make the area more prosperous as it would allow more high net-worth residents to the area. Do you think any of NorCal would care about SoCal's drought issues, or the Central valley's concerns with water depletion, that essentially feeds the rest of the US and a lot of the rest of World?
The way the State was created was from a land prospectors POV, and gold mining tycoons only solidified it; so it should be no surprise that we became inter-dependent on each other's resources and require it to remain.
Also, I don't how long you've lived here, but California secession from the US should be a thing, and it wont happen if its as fragmented as you suggest. The political divide has and will always exist, but California is unique in that we some how make it work, its far from perfect but I've lived all over the World and no place feels like home in that respect. Switzerland came close, but tyranny from the many (cantons) is just as bad as tyranny from the few (heads of State).
Personally, I think voting rights on the State should be limited to Natural Born citizens only; this perspective of 'fuck you, I got mine' is one that is seen in Korea; where only the elderly are the ones that grew up with a unified Korea and still have family in the North and want to make accommodations to reunite. Whereas the young in the South don't care about the immense suffering taking place for their very own People. Its sad, but its a part of the current Human condition to render 'others' from 'us.'
I have/had family in NorCal, and SoCal for generations so its all the same place to  me.

I'd like to see the reports on how much of foreign capital is handled via HK, and any pertinent studies to support your financial based theories. 
As for my concerns with PLA/paramilitary in HK, I've spoken to activists/protestors on the ground in HK on reddit who have heard them speaking in military terms in Mandarin, suggesting they are military or paramilitary personnel. Given the atrocious acts, raping of women, shooting and beating civilians and referring to them as cockroaches it seems consistent with the indoctrination most Military have towards their 'enemies' and the behaviour we see during warfare/occupation.

I never put much stock into having immutable/timestamped messages on the blockchain as some suggested with social alternatives, but I can see why they thought it might be a good idea if stuff like that happens.
I wonder what Aaron **Schwartz** would have thought of this thing he helped built, the founders ceo etc... are all corrupt as hell. That is some 1984 shit.

I'm actually a big proponent of UBI, though I have significant reservations of it being based on the Nation-state level. 
However, we did not gather enough data from the Aurora coin situation to make any step forward with trying to implement it on the community level with a token based system like Bitcoin or something redeemable to it. 
I mean I would much prefer UBI to be based on a community merit based system, that once achieved can occur like what happened to Andreas from an Anon early adopter during the ATH in 2017. That's how it should be, you work away at a project on your dime and make inroads in something you believe in, and eventually you will be recognized by those who benefited enough from your work to return the favour and thus you can now focus on the skill set you've developed during those lean years and make the most of your time/resources and eventually do the same for others. 
That's an ideal situation, one that would require almost limitless time and resources to achieve at scale; so, while I detest people becoming even more dependent on the State for a livelihood/survival, the optimist in me wants to believe that many of these funds will be pooled together to create disruptive technology and innovations that are required to overcome the seemingly impossible tasks ahead of us while removing the need for Human drudgery. And for that we need much more data on how this all would work.
I kind of hope people don't use it to buy into crypto and inflate another speculative asset bubble like they did with alt(s) and ico manias, but I cannot stop them. 
I just think we're in a good place progress/price wise and that usually only happens when the price is stable and isn't hitting new ATH. Let us roll out LN with a few major corps like Kroger and Starbucks with some bug testing, and then we can ramp this up to 10k+.

Ok, let me tell you as person completely dis-involved with this situation; I don't care about your opinion if you haven't created a startup or business model to prove your ideals, you're not making a change posting on twitter and getting into useless feuds. 
Its a self-serving 'debate' for its own sake, you're not risking anything nor are you truly contributing to anything other than the giant morass of stupidity that takes place there 99% of the time. 
Leaving is preferential to me because if you put your ideal into practice you will have actual encounters with other individuals and will have to maintain some level of civility with people not of your 'tribe' if you want to be successful. Thus making you realize just how stupid it is to engage in these pursuits. 
I've had to live had work with marxist/socialist to accomplish my goals in the past, we had a lot of conflicting views but shook hands when the project was over and I never saw these people again in my Life. And that was ok, they're Humans with contrasting views and ideals than my own, so I had to find a way to maintain a mutually beneficial working relationship with them as it was in my interest to do so. 
You hiding behind a keyboard engaging in inflammatory discourse accomplishes nothing, and stunts you as a Human. Despite the hordes who flock to social media, and some spillover like in universities with their non-sense, things that seem important on in social media don't really exist in real life.  
Personally speaking as an anrcho-capitalist I think Libertarians are lazy thinkers at best, and localized tyrants at worst who seek to use the violence of the State to their benefit when it suits them. The have tired arguments of limited government, but that has never existed and the banality and wishful thinking to the contrary of it all bores me to tears. 
So, no you're POV or opinions don't matter to me, and 'we' are unfortunately aggregated together because of Bitcoin, I can't imagine those leftists could care any more than that, either. 
The World is full of 'sad things' try to improve those rather than focus your attention on your perceived notions of free speech on twitter, and their 'horrid' ToS there are more important things to solve in the World, I can assure you.

Everyone knew the narcos bought of politicians, so on one was really that surprised when one of the Presidents was being implicated in corruption the el chapo case, but imagine having the ability to trace all of that as its recorded on the blockchain. Its better for them just accept traditional payment: USD. 
That's why they're doing this, accountability is not something they want to implement when so much of the largess the Narcos provide to the politicians is revealed.  
That's really a shame about MX, for a period it looked like a viable option for Mexico to have BTC as a remittance system as so much money flows from families from the US to MX. 
Well, they force it go underground and will find out they really cannot stop it; at least if the State was receptive they could have encouraged a lot of disgruntled techies and crypto nerds in the US with beautiful Pacific coast weather and beaches with low cost of living to create a nice hub... instead they played their hands and its just another place where this tech will render these people obsolete faster.

On a custodial level, yes... they may not be operating on full reserves this way, its all off-chain, and delays and outages are a typical thing with them; the possibility of them not being able to pay all customers as they NEVER provided proof of reserves despite being requested for this time and again since GOX went down. Never mind the BS they had with rejecting or canceling orders if they felt it was not in their interest to do so early on. 3 of my deals got canceled despite having the highest tiered account at the time. 
I'm not interested in convincing you, my aim is to get new comers to not succumb to the willful ignorance of your cohort, which has been become commonplace.

Its a lost cause: been there, done that. They don't care about the tech, they care about upselling clients into using their 'private blockchains' on their Could system (IBM Z). Everything else is just noise.
Check this out,[IBM had first mover advantage and all the contracts with 10 Large multi-national food corps (Walmart, dole, etc...),]( and it was Kimble Musk's startup that ended up creating an elegant and simple to use food tracing/safety system:
Believe me when I say I'm disheartened that this is what is happening at IBM, but I'm super excited for the Team at Square roots proving others wrong (myself included) in thinking something as significant as this requires the resources and Human capital of a Mega-corp to solve.

Or just lay about... I've met and had to live with people like this throughout my entire Life and its a harsh reality to accept that this the net sum of their potential. 
A part of me harks back to the 'useless eater' analogy in frustration, but I was glad I was able to confront this aspect and come away with some insight: any system will be abused by Humans, that's a fact, however should that alone deter us from refining the process in order to give us a better World? Progress would never be made if that were the case with any technology or tool.
I don't know about you but, I started my first business in middle school, and a second by High School and into university, in fact it was able to pay for my first year of University as I didn;t qualifyfor any grants or scholarships (even though my freshman GPA was 3.6) ; all of this came at a huge cost, I had to put my social life on hold and I couldn't do much in terms of extra circular stuff and made me remain focused on a single Industry. I had lean years and had to shut it down as I could no longer cope with the time-resource loss, so I had to get a manual labor job as the economic crisis was getting worse into late 2007 to help pay only a part of my cost of living, while still incurring ten's of thousands of dollars in debt. Only to come out of University with the worst job market since the fucking Great Depression. 
I then became a founder of a startup much later in Life, due to the economic complications the aforementioned imposed upon me, and did the same but under even more leaner conditions because I felt I still had something left to give with my skill-set and knowledge I had acquired in Crypto and in Ag. I wasn't out for legacy, as many accused me of, I just wanted to make a difference where no one dared or cared to focus on.
I'd prefer for no one to ever have to go through that sameexact thing, otherwise I don't think anyone would do it as it was mentally and physically brutal. Though I do believe some challenge that exposes you to Human suffering is necessary for a well adjusted compassionate Human with a sane psyche. 
If UBI can help fund a new wave of idealistic, driven young people to get motivated about solving some of the World's biggest environmental and ecological disasters we're going to have to solve in our Lifetimes then I'm all for it. And help with addressing many of the complications with Mars colonization, asteroid mining, etc... which could one day lead to a post-scarcity World then its worth the cost in my view.   
A part of me wants to see what those SJW types would do with actual resources in their hands for their supposed causes, I highly doubt anything good would come from it after seeing the Occupy movement (who I think most are just a more lazy iteration of OWS) uselessly squander millions on self-serving BS instead of buying homes and arable farm land in Detriot--as it would be the testing ground and leader in urban farm land in the US and a hub for techies and artists alike) and testing out their version of a more 'equitable' society. 
But I'd like to be proven wrong and they do something positive with it.

Bitcoin isn't on the 'forex' which stands for foriegn exchange market, though it is listed on [XE.com]( instead its freely traded on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges.

Work can suck, sure; but if all you do in this space is trade, you're not really helping anyone but yourself and are perhaps the person this meme speaks to. 
You're not a market maker, you're not 'providing the Market with liquidity' you're as close to as a benign parasite as there is in this ecosystem. So whatever 'taste' you're talking about is near suicidal, if only by your own statement.
If so, get a better grasp on reality, you're also the reason why people post(ed) suicide hotlines here during crashes. This system rewards long term holders.
By the way, I'm pretty sure its all but proven that simply buying and holding in a dollar-cost-average strategy out performs every single trader's performance. 
All of which requires you have some income to rely on and capitalize on when the market dips.

I used this back in 2014 when talking to some higher ups at Novartis on a train in Zurich. I made it clear to them we were not after their money, but wanted an entire paradigm shift. Its been 10 years since Bitcoin was released, and I think we did that in fucking spades.
I try to stray away from the Boomer v Millennial frame of mind as its useless, and I've got to work with some awesome Humans who happen to have been born in that Boomer time frame.
But with that said, its shit like this that gets me most but I think that its an attitude seen amongst all ages/sex/race that I detest the most:
Their money is fiat based debt, and used to finance the worst atrocities on this planet, so their rebuttals about having money to finance their fantasy of retiring at 60 while living in a McManasion and being a parasite sucking off productive Humans in Society until their death is a fucking repulsive notion to me.

You guys are absurd, I'm all for hyperbitcoinization as an end, but the means is far more critical to get right: fiat doesn't need BTC to kill it, its doing that all by itself and globally.
There are far too many critical projects that rely on fiat for me to want to see it go away that fast, also Bitcoin is still far too esoteric for the mass end-user, even though we personally may think is easier than ever, its still not where it needs to be for most to even consider it an option--I'm of the view it will only work if/when most don't even know they are using it.
Relying on Visa/MC is not an option any more, and we need to do a better job of getting merchants setup with that before anything like hyperbitcoinization is actually a remote possibility.

But is a given in the economic.political system we're forced to currently operate in, my question to you is: would you rather have no say in funding the most expensive education system (US) and creating a mediocre labor force for jobs that don't exist now let alone in several years, or helping fund the moonshot in what could potentially get the ball rolling for that post-scarcity World you've described?
It's a long shot, for sure, with less than ideal odds of it paying off.
Look at my posts I have made on this thread, I detest that UBI will have to be (initially) a nation-state based system; but we didn't do enough in the Crytpo community to do anything about it as we lost sight of this after aurora coin failed to iterate upon it as we were too focused on hardforks, politics, useless drama, alts, ICO mania etc... 
We are partly to blame for this, so if nothing else we should gather the data necessary to refine this and deploy it via an opt-in system like we have with Crypto. but that will never happen without it being tested out at scale.

I was going to say how odd that number looked, there are probably more ATMs than that in a single county in a well populated state in the US, let alone the whole country. 
But if its Bitcoin ATMs, that makes sense; those horrid things are scattered every where in the US and with KYC/AML plus the fees I can't see why any other country could want those things as a viable option to buy BTC. 
I mean I like the fact that Switzerland and France essentially rolled out their models with pre-existing infrastructure, underscoring how Bitcoin is actually tech with  programmable money layer, but that's not enough for most to care: so why would a high fee, super intrusive machine fare any better? 


Why would you want to go into a situation where BTC is your only option to pay for something at 3am? This is why cash will always have a use-case, for the time being anyway. If I know I need crypto I bring a hot wallet in tow before I leave the house, problem solved. Or I call up and annoy one of my crypto nerd friends if its really desperate, And before you ask: I had a stranger on a telegram chat send me some btc ($5?) on my co-founders phone for a demo tx when the battery on my hot wallet phone died at a conference. 
I tried to send it back to him (with interest) after the presentation, and the guy refused, haha! Those were the days.

While I agree with the sentiment of your statement, as people focus far too much on the price without contributing to the advancement of this tech and simply chart-stare instead: the fact is we have no idea where the price will go.
I'm lucky enough to say I saw it do some amazing things, you talk about 100x, but when some of use started it didn't even have a monetary value associated to it where you could say that statement is accurate... but, if we are indeed building the Internet's native currency, as Big Tech proponents like Jack Dorsey (creator of Twitter and Square) claim it to be, and are going in deep on that bet, then its stupid to assume it can't or won't happen. 
It's simply not possible to ascertain a fiat price accurately in this space, where we go from this is anyone's guess. Up until a few days ago some of you were salivating at the idea of some 4chan anon moving the price on nothing more than a fucking meme post. You guys, espeically you new ones, are really ridiculous; but that post reminded me of the old days as oldfags of /b/ we did a lot of non-sense back then and that was pretty good lulz. actually. Especially when Snowden got involved. 
With that said, Layer 2 is fleshing out nicely, and soon enough we will have a mature network with which to reliably be able to do large scale txs that rival the Visa and MC networks put together instantly and at little to no costs. That alone has the potential to place it into places we could never imagine, the 20k ATH was absurd, the tech was no where near what it is now, Segwit alone was being held back for those reasons. 
China recently saying they are open to 'blockchain' tech and creating their own crypto can also spur on an arm's race between nations states, too... again its hard to do anything but postulate on what-ifs, but the future for this Network/tech is bright.

Honest question, because I don't care about social media at all: why don't you just leave?
There are plenty of competitors: decentralized social media was the panacea for many in the early days and things have emerged to fill that. Steem, Zeronet etc... Also, Reddit is highly censored, yet you're still here.
Its not like you pay for this service, why should they care about your specific concerns, assuming it was not arbitrary, about preferential treatment of said 'leftist?' Its a free service and you're not obligated to participate if you don't think it aligns with your personal views, and in true Crypto-anarchist idealogy, why don't you just fork it and create your own alternative where this doesn't apply?
To me this seems like the typical mindless and aimless SJW outrage culture spillover that has been so pervasive from that BS technology (social media), even amongst those who contend to be anti-sjw.

What's 'free market' about having to be forced to give your tech to the State in order to operate a business, and if you eventually do become big have to be nationalized, and as is the case with Ma and Alibaba, you're forced to have to step down and hand the company to a CEO vetted by the PRC. 
This is still communist at its core, by selecting who can enter and succeed in their economy; the only discernible difference is rather than oppressing their citizens for consumption, as was the case for most of these regimes, they seem to be pushing for it hard (replacing all other forms of ideology from what I can tell) and they come to represent the biggest market share for a lot of things as of late: it really has taken the worst of both systems and created a hybrid of absurd proportions, most people just focus on the air quality as the extent of teir enviormental damage, but China has destroyed 1/3 of its arable farm land due to the pollution. They've had to pour in 100s of billions into restoring that land and will take decades to do so.
Which is why they've been buying big farms in Australia for a while and their soft-colonialism in Africa. What's at odds with reality is how fast they gave the illusion of 'modernization' and 'social mobility' while still having some of the worst Human Right's atrocities in the World which allows for the citizens to passively allow for the creation of a panopticon all around them. 
Its frightening how quick the Human mind is to rationalization, and this is seems like the Soviet Union all over again.

Hmm... no link, just an image?
Has Bitcoin's image changed since Brock and his ilk have made all that noise about being the 'heroes' that PR needed and wanting to create a utopia?
I ask because just as we saw with Venezuela, BTC is an anti-fragile system and proved it could operate even in the face of a electrical and internet blackout, but that assumes their are contingencies in place before hand, not least of which requires a large part of Human effort to have infrastructure to overcome these shortfalls.

[Study the 3 laws of Thermodynamics; and then focus on the 2nd and how it relates to Entropy]( and its increase: it can only increase.
With that said, yes, the opponent from IBM used it as a dismissal when trying to convey his (poorly formulated) arguments and trying to instill a sense of chaos to be the only alternative, neglecting the fact the the very Internet and WWW was in fact built to be decentralized, and permissionless, thus anarchic. Which was at its core, was its greatest strength and managed to create its own order, albeit spontaneously so rather dictated to; it has, however, been pushed into this Orwellian panopticon since the end of the 90s.
I think the value of permissioned blockchains its overstated and really only has limited applications, but they do exist... however, they really don't  possess much of an advantage as Song has lined out. However, IBM is too heavily invested into this to just abandon it now; what I envisioned could be a boon for the turn around and modernization of IBM turned out to be just another business as usual disappointment.

Coinbase was training wheels, sure; but their practices are an affront to what BTC is/was to enable; the question, and outrage, is one not of UX, but one of a realization that it comes at too high a cost. I was an early adopter of Coinbase, and I even wanted to work there at one point, serious, check my post histry back in 2013...
But after 2015, with the myriad of options to buy, they were already irrelevant; now they are just cancer to the ecosystem.
In short, if you really want to buy this way, check out Cash App, Jack is a big BTC proponent with the right mindset. He's become a sterling member of the the community and deserves to have his Cash App be the default payment gateway in 2019 and onward.


Why do I feel that is being said sarcastically, if not disapprovingly so, which again is missing the point of what BTC is: Gox coins were not BTC, nor are coins held by Coinbase, they're all off chain. So, even if you're asking this without the snark, you're missing why Gox set us back so much, and Coinbase is just as bad in this regard.

The same applies to the 4chan gag, I think you should realize Humans are dumb in general regardless of what position you take on posterity, especially in places like this... And, yes, time traveler it was more of a lulz thing that some took far too serious; this is why I kind of agree when some say we as Bitcoiners function like a cult, most seek figureheads to dictate to them the edicts by which we should all conduct ourselves by, going so far as to say we're going to be in some Utopic citadel. This is the rapture 3.0 or something.... The reality is if you've been to any meetup in the last 5 years you probably wouldn't want to spend more than an hour or 2 with those people for the rest of your Life, let alone live out the apocalypse with any of them.
2013 was our Eternal September in that regard.
Sidenote: That Time traveler always sounded like a John Titor/Steins;Gate meets Bitcoin screenplay to me, like someone had to see how absurd it would sound before they pitched it. And as an amateur writer, it did make me want to play with it as fan-art in a Black Mirror-esque way.

So, I've been giving this some thought as to how to accelerate the adoption of LN to commercial/retail customers; I was hoping, like you, that Dorsey would have something out by now. But, its still early days, and they have an entire legal framework to work with so I can understand an appreciate that.
As intermediary solution I think  you can do all of that rather easily, but requires you migrate away from iOS. I just have to have and think about a more nuanced approach for BTC-Fiat that I used in the past to test out before I deploy, if you're in the US. Everywhere else is way easier--but reach out if you want to talk about that as well.
Now, in regards to just an outright watch only wallet, that's simple: first move away from Apple products is my PERSONAL advice, and then just import a wallet address from a different device that you personally hold using Mycelium. Its that simple, you can rest assure that if they steal the device nothing is held on there. They can bring up the wallet's QR code and any incoming tx should be displayed in real-time. (I can't recall when Mycelium for iOS was last updated, but it could technically be done on there, too as it was a basic feature from the early days.)
Personally, I've been keeping an eye on the google play store to check out the new Blockstream wallet today to see if it does everything I need it to do to make a recommendation on it, but its not on there yet. But I like the features that it is advertising.

And SpaceX's 'tail first' Starship should have given him pause to reconsider what and what isn't possible in that space. He sounds like all the old fossils at NASA in that regard, who sat around wasting time/resources and negating the fact that SpaceX's technological advances, that were thought to be impossible, happened in very clear and observable timelines (Stage 1 Recovery being the most glaring of all).

If I'm honest, once I saw certain regions in Chile were running on 100% renewable energy I thought we'd see a boom in btc mining there. The same applied to Denmark, but it just didn't happen.
If BTC can do anything in this case, which I'm not entirely up to speed on, but it sounds like their wages are not keeping up with the rising costs of living/inflation? 
Bitcoin and Crypto-anarchy isn't just about separating money from the State; that's simply an imbecilic position only a libertarian can convince themselves of, when in fact its chief aim is to render the State itself obsolete. Money is just the foundation by which the State subjugates its populace, its effective, but its not the only thing it uses, as someone mentioned violence is its core mean to maintain itself. Money, and the lack of it, simply inhibits People from working on or embracing alternatives.

Interesting position and argument; I was actually talking to a friend not to well versed on the Humanitarian Crisis ongoing in Hong Kong over dinner last week and it became clearer to me as we spoke that one point I could see the CCP/PRC justifying their overt violent barbarism is taking over Hong Kong's financial position in the World as their economic growth is shrinking and outright contracting. 
I told him this is why I fear it could kick-off WWIII, as most Western Multinational corps and Banks have some relationship with Hong Kong, his response was 'you don't mess with a Rich man's money.' That's when a sudden panic washed over me and I thought what the implications beyond what we've seen were. 
The 'One China' policy and the subsequent posturing they resorted to in SE Asia for territory and resources is one thing, but actively occupying a nation with PLA/paramilitary that are already under your thumb (all elected officials are appointed/approved by CCP, see: Lam) to mark your presence makes no sense. Especially when a larger wealth gap between the mainland and HK was evident since 2014, from an Imperial view, its best to keep them as content/placid as possible unless you want to foment revolution in Tibet, Macau and Taiwan as well.

Cost being the same I'd never use Airbnb, the support Team at Airbnb is horrible and can easily ruin a trip and take forever to get back to you; veen during emergencies. They already started to offshore their Customer Service reps, I could barely understand a guy who I surmised was from Africa. and then got sent to China after I requested to speak to someone else. 
I'm not being racist, but I was frustrated with 1 hour wait/hold times on phone calls and then having to remind the guy on the other end that I couldn't understand him was enough to make just pay the extra money for a short stay in a hotel nearby.

I really do feel bad for the guy, and I just hope he can take solace in knowing that what he did with the final goxxing and those that came before it were mainly based on incompetence not malice and that he did the best he could with this civil rehabilitation thing. 
Its harsh, on a Human level, to see this happen to the guy that gave the Bitcoin community its first exchange platform. I just hope he did hold on to some coins from his earnings back in the day to pay for a legal team to at least get a reduced sentence; at this point I think its clear that he's going to jail again, the Japanese have a pretty draconian legal/conviction rate and they have expended way too much energy/resources on this and it has gotten way too much media attention for it to just blow over.

No one else has the penetration that Square does within the small business merchant like Square does, and if we onbordered them onto LN with ease of use, this could be the step we needed to finally be able to put the currency aspect of Bitcoin into real World scenarios to improve upon.

Its sad to see Ross in a Super Max (is he still in CO?) that's often reserved for the most violent criminals, for what amounts to charges of simply running a website. We can go back and forth on bad OPSEC, and why he didn't just leave the US, but the fact remains this was an unjust prosecution; its just the the State needed to make someone into example, the thing is... it didn't work. DNM are just as prolific as they were back then. What they killed was a once flourishing community of people who felt this was a worth while pursuit, who have since been scattered throughout the internet.
What has to be underscored is just how egregious the court system is, it makes a mockery of the concept of 'Justice' when you still see executive crooks at HSBC who have actually been caught red-handed laundering money for the Drug Cartels be given nothing but a fine (the cost of doing business) and are still out jet-setting around the World like nothing happened.
Ross is a political prisoner, he was made an example of by the State, nothing will change that and his lifetime sentence re-affirms just how high the stakes are for true freedom fighting: I truly hope Ross has made peace with that.

Its unfortunate that this is case, but they were the most resilient and honest exchange up until that point; all while operating under the guise of a shady operation run by anons in E. Europe.
I'm way more impressed with what they did, and as quick as they did it, then with what GOX has done after all the BS; no one is being made whole and a ton of Japanese bureaucrats and lawyers seem to be the only one's who are truly reaping the rewards from BTC's price rise.

The thing is that the 'porn industry' is no longer an identifiable cohesive entity anymore; I spent 5 mins checking this chicks twitter (she reminded me of a girl from University I used to hang out with), and she re-tweeted a post in which it explicitly says they prefer to shoot and deliver their own content on there own websites/services. Making upwards of 30k/month according to the OP!
I think that this paradigm, while very effective in bringing about change(s) to large platforms, is itself a decentralized system that requires a more nuanced approach. One in which crypto and Bitcoin specifically can and has played a large part in experimenting with new ideas. Most forget that in addition to things like Backpage and such in the US, an Escort site in the UK accepted BTC almost exclusively for a while. 
Sex workers are often the first to get hit with financial censorship, and legal/illegal theft so they understand the implications better than most. I think that much like the legal MJ Industry, sex work could be legalized overnight but the banking side of things wouldn't really change much if at all. (Read: Canada)


She looks to be doing well for herself, though I'm not sure she's a porn girl so much as a dancer/escort/cam-girl. With that said, it could of been worse; she's a savvy entrepreneur that understands the tech to some degree and has deployed it for her services, also her post about Faketoshi tshirt client was amusing.  


IRS gonna love that
While I'm sure this is some edgy hyperbole, I think Education is now a viable value added service in this Space for People like this woman who may not grasp all of the seemingly daunting specs of this tech, Privacy often being the most elusive of all. In addition to doing Payment processing and Financial Services, I found our startup did more in Education than anything else, as most--who actually took the time to care about the matter--found themselves asking a lot of pertinent, yet abstract, questions about Money itself. Privacy and the lack of it in the Modern Financial World was a huge topic of discussion. 
With that said, I had this weird recurring dream I was walking into a club with girls wearing those odd cosplay fuzzy tail-like things that were fashionable a few years back with something like embedded NFC enabled Hardware wallets and smart watches with a simple UI to verify payment. Such that if you fancied a girl for a tip or lapdance or something you could discreetly pay her without too much of a fuss and go about your business. This was about the time that one broad posted a pic of her QR code tattoo here, so... maybe 2011? 
I don't personally get why people pay for pr0n, beyond those very edge fetishes, but its undeniable that they do; so its only logical that capturing those who want to do so with this tech should be a benchmark in our collective roadmap. We need easier UI and better UX to along with Educational Outreach to onboard these guys on, personally I think we could do a lot more good doing this than letting an evil Alibaba entity hand out sats for spying on you on behalf of the CCP/PRC or getting some bankster funded ETF online.

I just read this: [
With things like Extinction Rebellion taking off amongst Gen Z, or whatever precedes Millennials, I think the target is focused on Boomers and the politicians/CEOs of that age for having wrecked the Ecosystem. Gen X should also be included, but I'm beyond such divisive BS that I prefer to focus on the simple fact that for young People: extinction is actually a real concern (myself included)!
Given that Millenials have been the reason for things like the share economy and long term co-habitation (roommates) I think they are acutely aware that we as a generation have not been able to make that ecological destruction that Boomers have given the lack of resources and social mobility. Our levels of consumption are drastically lower. 
Also note that its because of Millennials 'expensive avacado toast' tastes that Organic and local food as a [branding/marketing]( strategy has taken off. 
In many ways, I think we're the cautionary tale for what happens when the previous generation fucks you over so hard that you better have an alternative in place because we were forced to drink the kool-aid and cannot (often) escape this debt-laden dystopia despite where our (a)politics/morals/ethics lie. 
And none of us can or will escape the ecological collapse and climate change, but we're likely to die before they do so its clear they have to do something drastic as the model is not just broken its cancerous.

That happened in Colorado, too; an over saturation of supply is inevitable and will eventually find an equilibrium as the price will drastically reduce. If CO is a predictor it will likely be used to make other consumables, and products (lotions, tinctures, balms, etc...) as the Market matures. Consumers for those products are far greater than the dispensary regulars, the issue is how to tap into that Market share which is spurring on another gold rush mentality in my observation. 
But I think that is a necessary growing pain, I'm still not sure about WA's model, but if you say its successful... Is it as consolidated as CO? Because while amendment 64 proved to be an economic boon on paper, the truth is the barrier of entry is such that no one without a million+ in capital can even think to enter the space anymore. 
California's model is actually really cool the more I look into it, they have a 1 acre restriction until 22' and are also helping people who were convicted of MJ related crimes prior to legalization. The size restriction allows for mom-pop dispensaries to still operate and thrive, for the time being anyhow. 
I'm not entirely in favour of legislation based community assistance, but since its a reality (for now) its actually a well thought out system. And I actually liked CA's model prior to recreational legalization, it was probably the best hands-off Market approach. Of course, this enabled a lot of unscrupulous things, not least of which was raids from the Federal Government/DEA on legal operating businesses, but that still applies to any of the other State's with a MJ program.

I stand corrected, she most definitely comes from the porn World. I thought she was doing exclusive cam-girl stuff (fapping to Vitalik was truly wtf stuff, the guy is like 90 lbs) as that is what she was promoting herself as on twitter. But, as it turns out she has a ton of Industry stuff, too.
I don't want to talk about my past with a girl who ended up in that Industry, its probably more common in SoCal than in anywhere else but maybe Tokyo, but... lets just say one I did know was far from quiet, but she did have the most insecurities of her body of any girl I have ever been with.
I remember there was a middle school teacher who got fired for being an ex-porn girl, she was quite candid about it being poverty that drove her to it.
With that said, after all my years in crypto I don't think sex work is anything to be ashamed of. I personally think its like any profession that requires hands on interaction; in fact when I lived in Switzerland (where prostitution is legal) the family I worked for had several homes, and on occasion I'd stay at the one in town for a weekend getaway with my fiance or for a repair job and the next door neighbor was a high end escort; we'd give her her tomatoes and zucchini from the farm for her to check in on the house and water the plants and such while we were out in the country or the alps.
She wasn't my type, but I can see why she could afford a house in that canton/city despite being in her early 30s given her profession.

This seems entirely absurd, not the game itself, but the fact that is how 'value' can be generated in Markets.
I think after 2008 I felt a deep sense of weltschmertz not just knowing and then confirming that the World's economy was just one big (rigged) Casino run by Banksters with bots that do HFT. But that the efforts, Human Capital and labour of better Men are left to the devices of people who do this all day.
Who in the fucking World has the temerity to tell an aspiring chemical engineer, aerospace engineer, or a biochemist that their ability to function and succeed in the World is primarily dictated not by their own ability, but by the flimsy nature and lack of stability created by People who do this and can in turn destroy the World's economy and get bailed out when it all goes wrong.
OP's thing is fine, albeit comical because it negates how much bot trading already takes place, but its the description with which he explains what it is that is taking place. I keep thinking of that scene in the Big Short when Bear Sterns goes down and the guy ends with saying 'I thought we were better than this.'

The title may be a bit absurd if not outright edgy, as its selecting from the most brazen of quotes in the entire article, but that's the click-bait journalism that is here to stay. I'm affraid.. but for those of us who actually recall the Maidan, BTC was in fact a savior for many. Capital controls struck fast, there was no way of getting food or supplies as cash had run dry, and people were out protesting were getting shot/seriously maimed or killed.  And like in most of Eastern Europe, if you're not paying someone off you're not getting any services, especially medical.
Bitcoin proved itself as a worthy alternative, and given the fact of how fucked Ukraine has gotten in the recent past (Gulags during Soviet Union) its no surprise they're willing to explore all options rather than let happen again. Even the 90s after the Soviet collapse was rather bleak. So terrible for such a beautiful part of the World with an awesome Culture.
The AR Satoshi statue is... odd, but Art is like that, it has to provoke and evoke something.
A lot of it seems like valid concerns brought up in the POV of a country ravaged by War, and BTC is playing a supporting role in helping people preserve their wealth in troubling times. 
You should watch a documentary on the Revolution to see what they face(d), maybe then you'll realize what their plight is like:

Can we just forget about what China's 'official' position(s) will be already? These people have some of the most tyrannical practices surrounding tech imaginable, they data mine via Alibaba like no ones's business, they have probably the most advanced facial recognition surveillance system to monitor their populace 24/7 and are soon to unleash Seaseme Credit's dystopian nightmare to cap all that off. 
China, specifically what it's Government thinks, is irrelevant at this point because all signs lead to them creating an Autocratic Society in which all financial transactions are monitored and known to the State and aggregated to yield some good citizen benchmark. Ironically, this is exactly why China (it's People) needs bitcoin, despite its Government's stance which is all too clear and not in favour of it regardless of what ever hype/fear piece comes from their presses to manipulate short term prices. 
Hopefully it collapses before they get to play out their own version of the 21st Century Soviet Union.

We don't get an option when it comes to things like Medicare/Social Security if they're employed. Which is why those continue to be doled out, I'd gladly opt-out if I could. My employer pays for 1/2 of my medical insurance, and I pay the other half and I have an active job and lifestyle, I work out regularly and eat healthy: I don't need or want Medicare but I'm subsidizing it for those who are on it already.
Its funny, I was in a sociology class back in 2005, in the midst of the bubble era, and the professor flat out said there wouldn't be any funds left in either social security or Medicare to cover the costs of anyone attending the class below the age of 30. Considering this was an auditorium class with 1st year freshmen (it was a low level GE class) most just ignored it. 
But I was taken back by the statement and went home and started to research about the unfunded liabilities; I later wrote a paper on that topic and she and I chatted at office hours about that and other topics.

Again, HER, not Theranos... which is what I was trying to clear up, I'm not trying to speak for or defend his gullibility for her.
Listen, there have been so many scams/scammers in BTC in its first 10 years and people have gotten burned on that, so lets not negate that by making it seem that we're a paragon of all knowing truth despite our very skeptical nature and culture.
These things happen, unfortunately, and speaks more to the Human condition than it does to a technological panacea.
I finally saw Nightcrawler again, and yeah... she is exactly like Louis to me, its almost like a cookie cutter archetype actually; so except for the fact that rather than having to see the gritty side of LA News 'show business' she got to play disruptive startup founder role in VC money land (Silicon Valley), which is equally as absurd if you think about it.
And subsequently, the latter is so much more politically motivated that stuff like gender 'equality' is forced down our throat, except when its negative (as is the case with her), then its just this outlier situation to be omitted to suit a narrative/agenda.
I've personally had more female supervisors than male, and despite that I find they're more or less equally insufferable as each other--its just done in different ways. In my experience Females in power are far more territorial and will quickly get rid of you if they see you as a threat without discussion/warning, where males are just super demanding but their arrogance makes them blind. She and Sonny were just the embodiment of that dynamic, too.

It was only a matter of time, check my recent post History, its filled with me pleading with them to understand what War they are really fighting on their subreddit: its one of class divide, the mainland political/affluent class and the hordes of cheap Money and access to resources/real estate and the Hong Kong Elite who profit from their collective exploitation--while a large section of the older generation watch their children with distinct sense of apathy or indifference. For anyone who was involved with 2014's Umbrella revolution, we all saw what was on the horizon to a degree but it played out with a level of intensity (on both sides) that gave us all pause. The cage houses, and the way in general the poor live is fucking sad beyond words and in a way foreshadowing what is possible even in what is regarded as an affluent Westernized part of the World.
It's been a tragic state of affairs, that due to my past involvement with other movements has put me in a deep state of despair; I take solace in knowing that Human resistance towards tyranny still exists in the World. One that looks surmountable at times, but is fought on many fronts none the less.
But an Education on Finance, and the dire implications it has on daily Life, is still drastically lacking even in the most 'Free Economy' in the World. Revolutions aren't won when their is blood on the streets, be it from Freedom Fighters or that of Tyrants, its when minds are changed in masse which in turn create and inspire others to see that vision out. I think that's what is missing most here, their is no coherent structure other than a will to fight the problem head-on with abject violence as the State's response.

Also would purposely making typos on sentences to throw off the algo be possible?

Has anything like a Guifi or other wide scale meshnet deployment come along in order to support/test out this at all?
My friend who used to play with CJDNS stuff with me back in the day went in deep on SKY, he said this was the answer to it.

Don't do it, you coming back able-bodied to use that GI Bill isn't a guarantee. I was an arrogant bastard at your age and thought Community College was for losers who couldn't get into a 'real school,' only to find myself 4.5 years later at University (going deeper into debt while working crazy hours) and simultaneously going to a community college because of budget cuts and reduction in available classes in order to graduate before the crisis struck (2008). 
You're likely to find yourself in the same situation as nothing has changed since then, its only seemingly gotten worse.
See where your entrepreneurship takes you while going PT to a local Community College and take a look at things like Coursera for things that peak your interest and continue to invest in Bitcoin, especially right now with the price dip; its the best thing that I could recommend a fellow entrepreneur. 
If mowing lawns gets old, a A+ certification is relatively cheap and easy to study for (lots of torrents for guides/tests) and relatively easy if you understand tech. You won't makes tons of money doing it, of course, but it will give you a more stable schedule as you progress at school and give you relevant work experience if you decide to go into tech. 
Chances are you don't even know what you want to do with your Life if wasting ~4-5 years, with a possibility of active duty in war-zones and who knows how many tours, is something you're willing to sign up for. The last thing you want to do is to be permanently maimed for Life and have nothing to show for it and being a burden on your family because of it; go to a VA hospital parking lot or lobby, see what that 'Life' really gets you when the inevitable happens.

Yeah, they also took down Switzerland's oldest bank, Wegelin, in 2013 after the US started to investigate them for helping US Citizens 'evade' taxes.
That pretty much ended the Swiss cartel on secrecy, and started to stop issuing accounts to all US citizens and sent a cascade of events that pretty much ended the era of banking secrecy.
What's ironic is that the British off-shore just grew in orders of magnitude, and the Panama papers helped elucidate how others got around it, too.
Either way, it was a much needed incident, do not expect Banks to protect you whether it be privacy, secrecy or just to have documentation on hand so as to not kick you out of your house after you paid for it.
BTC and Crypto lets you be your own bank, and when done correctly no one will know what you may or may not have. That's the best we can wish for, anything else is a pipe dream and this ETF BS has the possibility of being another GOX.

Rad, looks like you guys had a blast and had a decent turn out; I've seen meetups in tech hub cities in the US with less people. 
In terms of Crypto/Bitcoin Education, where would you rank Indonesia on a scale of 1-10? I ask because as we see Hong Kong descend into the situation it has, and despite it being a financial hub, they are completely oblivious to it as a tool to overcome financial censorship. I'm also starting to notice how every little it is understood in that part of the World (SE Asia) despite how much it is needed.
I'm willing to go so far as to say that things like Green School in Indonesia should be teaching its students about entrepreneurship and crypto as a means to facilitate the change it claims to want to see in the World as its friction-less and border-less nature as well as its low environmental impact makes it an ideal choice to ground its youth in to achieve its goals.

It was actually that all the data was encrypted and then the paper records were destroyed. The plot goes deeper with currencies, and Bitcoin becomes a core component of the story-line.


I think it's because its too apt that it is being overlooked by the masses, they want to live in a fantasy World with things like dragons in Game of Thrones or some other escapist pursuit.
I've come the realization that most of Humanity, and especially the TV watching masses, live in a perpetual state of 'make-believe.' Its like the Peter Pan syndrome writ large, but since so many engage in it becomes a sort of parallel reality that gives them some sense of deluded comfort.
I don't mean that to be edgy, I seriously cannot get into such far-flung stories because it seems like a waste of my limited time, and I'd rather focus on shows that focus on more pressing issues with the little TV I do watch.
Esmail is a damn genius, his attention to detail with the hacks were/are brilliant, his cinematography skills are among the best ever; but its the way he engages with his audience with such a gripping script and storytelling that is most fascinating in my opinion as an amateur writer.

I'm not that much of a strict maximalist anymore, as more privacy based tools have emerged (wasabi being the best) to obfuscate the source of the coins. But I've been telling people to leave Coinbase since at least 2014, these guys are the Goldman Sachs of Bitcoin.
Cash App renders them obsolete, and goes to support core devs now, whereas Coinbase buys up security intrusive startups that can get someone killed. The choice is obvious, convenience has a cost, now we know how low Coinbase are willing to go to sell you out, so the choice is yours.


I'm now convinced that mass adoption will only happen when this tech is so easy to use most of its user-base won't even know they're using it anymore. It'll have to look and feel like modern day Online banking, or even simpler for the masses to even consider jumping ship--think playskool toddler toy UI. 
Until then, its still early days; and to be honest, I need to buy more so I'd prefer to let it play out a bit longer.

Furthermore, it resulted in banks evicting homeowners who had already paid their mortgage as a result of not knowing that information. They also did a great deal of underhanded things as they operated without needing proof of ownership to make owners re-finance in order to take their property from them, they mainly targeted the elderly minority; the Well's Fargo scams are so fucking inhumane and should have caused mass revolt against the banking system were not for a very effective Formal Education system specializing in conditional subservience.

I understand that on a technical level that might be seem reasonable, but Satoshi's whitepaper essentially defied the paradigm of its time and went on to solve the Byzantine General's problem; once thought to be impossible to solve by these very CS academics. And it was done and iterated via FOSS practices and the members of the community, who often didn't have a degree in CS or at all in some cases!
So, no... I think this guy is just like Krugman or Buffet in that they would never go along with it as its an existential threat to them (often older guys) and what they have built their cushy careers on.
The young(er) and more risk taking cohort have already migrated, or have been involved for some time as the brain drain began sometime in 2013-14 or so.
'Bovine excrement' is also what replenishes the soil to yield bountiful harvests, so even if his analogy held true, I'd say that is a complement as that is exactly what Bitcoin has done to its advocates as it re-energized and mobilized a movement in Society who sought to ensure we have a secure financial fail-safe (see Venezuela, or Ukraine) for their house of cards.

I think I can out-do that, I had a local CU that didn't have any branches nearby except for 1, despite their biggest selling point is being able to use the Network in all 50 states in the US. I opened an account here because it was the best of all the worst possible options.
So, about a 1.5 year ago, their old diebold machine was hacked and had compromised several clients ID with embedded card swipers, and this was at their flagship HQ in the lobby and at the single ATM teller! I saw as they gutted the thing in the lobby when one of the managers asked that I come in a few weeks later.
My account and my balance was locked for several weeks, without notice, it wasn't until I tried to move those funds that I was made aware of this. I had to explain to everyone who I owed money to that I had to go through a re-verification process to reclaim my balance, in person... several times. Which made moving a nightmare, but that's another story.
Flash forward to last summer, and I tried to use an ATM out of state for the first time. And when I get there its the same diebold machine that I saw at HQ, and this one couldn't read checks to save its pathetic obsolete self from a trip to the junk yard so it made me think it was compromised, too. So after several outages, I think 5 on my watch, and 3 repairs they had to upgrade the machine. They did... and the check scanner was better on this new model after the technician calibrated it 4-5 times in a span of 2 weeks (I got to know him by this time), but the post office in which it was located started to close the lobby after 7pm after the Summer. I often got out of work at 2am most of the week... 
I just ended up using the cashback option at groceries stores for petty sums before I went to work, it was an absurd thing to do as I usually had to plan a day or two ahead if I needed more than just pocket money and make sure I went to the branch ATM. 
Its pathetic how archaic this system is, its many inconveniences and how much relies of Society relies on it (which is to say all of it). It reminds me of being a kid in the early 90s trying to write a report for school waiting for the library to be open, going there, needing a membership, hoping someone had returned the book I needed etc... when only a few years later I could use the Internet to look for whatever topic I wanted to write about, it was clunky and the search results often required multiple attempts to get it just right but it worked 24/7, provided AOL or a phone call wouldn't kick me off that is. That's where I think we are in this process; the tech works, but its hard to use (for most) and its clunky so we need to get better at that.
This is why I think Kroger being our first true stress test for LN is critical if we want to make this a reality we need have the infrastructure and the UI/UX to take on this massive undertaking; we will mess up and their will be mistakes along the way, but relying on the fiat banking system is deadly at this point. They know this, but the end user needs to have a way to do this.

Furthermore, its a way to leap past the need for intermediaries where no regulation exists; much like the recent prevalence of internet connectivity in that part of the World represents having new netizens come online, it also denotes a lot of untapped Market participants. So providing them the tools (financial services and payment processing) to do so only makes sense.
If you've been in the space long enough you will have no doubt heard about onboarding the 'unbanked,' those without the means or documents to acquire those services traditionally, and enabling them to participate in the broader developed World's economic system with nothing more than a smartphone and Internet connectivity (see: borgenproject link) and bypassing the need for a bank opening in their rural village.
Personally, I like to reference an article on System D by OECD, that stipulated in 2011 that it was the 2nd largest economy in the World, estimated at $12 Trillion and growing; and it comprised mainly of grey-Market and Black Market workers:
This not only represents a large, and currently ignored sector of the Human population, but its also a lot of untapped amount of Human Capital as well as investment opportunities via microfinance. Most don't know this, but studies have been done on rural African farmers that have taken advantage of micro-loans often have an absurdly low default rate and adds substantially to their GDP:
Moreover, Patrick Byrne hinted to be working on some incredibly lofty goals in Africa, like voting and new stock market analogues in the region and such, but with his recent exodus I think that much is pretty much dead in the water for now. I'd really like to hear him do a podcast and be interviewed on where it all stands, now that he's severed all ties with Overstock.

If so, fuck... years in prison, personal attacks on him and his safety online, the stress on him and his family, and he still does this?

While having any of them enter this space would be a great step towards removing the monopoly from Bitmain, the problem--as I see it--for overcoming mining centralization is one of establishing Open Hardware. 
Anything short of that will just lead to more consolidation of the hashing power. 
I wouldn't mind mining at a loss, provided I could make my own device(s) like I did with my nodes (rp2). And while I would always do so at a loss, I'd be fine with it if this could scale. 
I really hope 21 had a significant windfall with the recent price increase and they get back to making the devices they projected that would make this all possible.
We now have a $54+ Billion Market cap/Ecosystem, if this doesn't warrant the possibility of implementing Open Hardware, I'm really not sure what will anymore.

Bitcoin itself? Scale. Its too damn big at this point to be 100% on renewable, that doesn't mean there aren't other cryptos trying to achieve or reward others for producing renewable energy, though. 
Check out solarcoin, it incentivizes people who use PV and pays them out in SLR, which is/was able to be sold for other cryptos on exchanges. 
I'm conflicted with BTC's energy needs, as anyone else should be, but what I have realized is that: this is the True cost of actual Security. Its like asking why helmets require so much scrutiny, and why they're so expensive: because, [when they occur you get to walk away with your head intact and live to fight another day.]( (That guy got away from that as was in the paddock joking around that race weekend.)
In an ideal World it shouldn't be, and in time I hope we see more Mining operations move more to hydro powered areas outside of China, use PV and have the heat use as a plant nursery/greenhouse or some other auxiliary use. But that is way off in the future, if at all, that all you as an individual proponent can think do is make changes to reduce your own carbon footprint.
I've started to cycle more and more these days, I mean I did it before anyway, as its good daily exercise, but in the past 3-4 years I only put like 3-4k on my daily cars. Lots of other things, too, but I won't get into that here.

But hasn't it already been established that they're being confiscated by customs/LEO if they contain those things?

What i would suggest, given my background, is that you reach out to local farmers and set something that way directly, but I'm not sure if ALL of Venezuela's farm land has been entirely nationalized. In Greece when cash/euros became scarce they started to issue their own to circulate for goods and services back in 2009. Whether Bitcoin can fill that role is not for me to say, given the complexity of rolling it out, but its worth attempting to reach out to them as it can be sent with even sms technology if need be.
When I was in Germany one of my colleague's grandfather defied the Nazi party after his land was nationalized by having pigs hidden away in the Black Forest to feed his family, he said as the rations dwindled that is the only reason they survived the latter half of the war. Sobering, albeit useful anecdote to remember how resilient Humans really are.

Honestly, I have found that Bitcoin doesn't really make any sense if you just buy it online or from a BTM; you can do it, but it doesn't 'click' as its really cumbersome to acquire from fiat when not p2p. I found the best way is to go to a Meetup, ask to purchase a small amount (think $10) and interact with the members there. 
When you realize how this works at p2p level that is when your curiosity will be piqued you will then find yourself researching and devising the best-fit solution for you--OPSEC, storage, purchasing, selling are all subject to its particular use-case. 
Here is a good primer:

I honestly don't think many people really overcame the swipe it mentality in the US; NFC tap/pay options are a mere novelty, and it wore pretty thinly.
A lot of the EU has those tap/pay chip enabled payment systems, and I saw them used, just not as often... it did not seem to become a new paradigm because of how true it is that most people are creatures of habit.

BUIDL was not coined by Ethereum users, and I have seen this time and again; it was in fact it was first 'coined' back in 2015 by Balaji at the Bitcoin Silicon Valley Job Fair in Sunnyvale during his talk when 21. was still under-wraps. He went on to espouse the necessity to actually create new use-cases and bring crypto into Industries that had not yet considered or adopted them. Very pertinent now and then. (This was the highlight of the entire event for me and gave me more motivation to go back and 'BUIDL' myself, and subsequently ended up missing AA's talk later that day.)
I was in total agreement--this was a critical focus of my narrative when sharing this tech to the uninitiated since I had learned about it in 2011--then and even more-so now as I write this. I still cannot believe they pivoted to that email thing and then got Coinbase to buy it... odd things happen in the Valley all the time, but this was perhaps too odd. I always thought they mined, held the coins, and reported the profit from their position(s) and spent what ever they had left in staff and experimental stuff like the 21 computer to justify their r/D costs and expenses.
As for AA, he's been doing this for sometime now, so nothing more to say other than: keep at it, dude!
Good to see him calling out the trappings of events like consensus and all these other non-nonsensical events that have been co-opted by the 'blockchain(s) not crypto' narrative.

Mycelium only lets you re-broadcast the transaction, you'd need a wallet that can do [CPFP]( tx like on Electrum to do what you're talking about; what was the fee, do you have the hash?

It is a sticky issue, which is why I'd say lets contact Natasia via Social media accounts (she hasnt used Reddit since that time in 2014 by the looks of it) and see if she could simply act as the intermediary escrow while funds are raised, once done they can be sent to your contact in Venezuela to distribute on the ground. 
Once complete he can simply provide images like Natasia did and perhaps include a break down of costs with receipts to ensure its legit and can continue operation. 
I mean I'd offer to act as the escrow holder, if Natasia is unavailable, if needed. But I can only offer my post history, which does have give-aways and tip-sprees I did in the past, not sure if that's enough to be 'trusted' though.

Sure, but I think the long-term goal would be to create a viable use-case and have them take it from there and adaptive it suit there respective needs; simply issuing donations never solves a problem, indvidual empowerment and innovative solutions are the most likely outcomes to reach a successful outcome. 
I can understand the quid-pro-quo incentive, especially since many people's names will likely appear on the IRS' CB list and reducing tax liability would be ideal for all involved, but its just not that easy. 
Fingers crossed someone does it, but I'd prefer to donate a sum I can afford and not seek anything else other than hoping it reaches those hapless [starving children forced into begging or prostitution]( at the hands of the grotesquely myopic State and its *economic policies* to curtail 'the mafia.'

Honestly... Mars is my vote, it would encourage colonization of brave, tech savvy Humans, and bring about a new frontier expanding operation on a wide scale if it were to be fully embraced; plus it would ensure that Bitcoin will be the first multi-planetary currency which should honestly be a benchmark for the next decade(s). 
Elon just spoke at the AI conference in China and agreed with Jack Ma that Human population collapse is something that is on the horizon in the next 20 years on Earth; I personally think its more like an overall correction, but agree that once we establish our first outpost/Hab on Mars it will be time to ramp up the population to ensure a steady stream of colonizers, I'm pro-Human but until then I'm not sure its as big a threat as they say it is.  
As for Earth, I'd say its likely not going to happen until all nation-states are rendered obsolete as it'd just be a big honey-pot for most despotic nations trying to maintain their fiat system at all costs. Or maybe just a wandering one that changes every couple of months or so to ensure anonymity, its probable best to hide in plain sight? One that is supported by daily membership fees to enter and paid in BTC in or something along those lines... I'd go a few times just for the experience if it had a nightlife and a food scene, I'll offer to DJ some Nerdcore and darksynth and do a few pop-up kitchen events for a limited duration if it were to become a thing to be honest.

Provided they have a low spread this may still be favourable; it may inhibit the ability for people to simply day-trade on the platform and instead will be more willing to be conscientious when they do withdraw to a private wallet.
Of course, this could go the other way and people will just never take their coins off the exchange and we have a Gox'ing in the making. 
With that said, given the recent news of Coinbase accepting upwards of 100s of millions of Institutional Money, it only makes sense they get in this space as their core business is prone to a ton of unnecessary complexity with varying payments systems (ACH/Swift etc...). I used Rakuten back in 2012, and while pricey, I understood the overhead they were taking on just trying to get my payment from my Visa debit card.

I think this division between *developed* and *non-developed* countries needs to be identified as such; the term 'first' and 'third world' has little to do with the aforementioned current socio-economic standing in the World and more due to absurd 'communist political aggregation' from the 50's as you have alluded to.
Also, I can attest to the resilience and adaptability of the impoverished; while certainly lacking in many things they can, in my experience, certainly learn quick if it means food arrives in belly and a roof is kept over their collective heads.   
And while the misery index being a barometer for adoption is not how I'd like Bitcoin or crypto to spread in an ideal case, it certainly has a propensity to resonate with those who need it most; hyper-inflation and food shortages are perhaps the best way to make this all make sense really quick: eg Ukraine 2014, and Venezuela 2016.

While I'd normally agree, mainly as street protests don't lead to much in terms of over all change and can often make things worse; however, Hong Kong youth are not just fighting a financial war, they're fighting for their Rights and Nation's sovereignty against a totalitarian regime with a PRC puppet government, as well as an ever growing wealth gap imposed to them by Beijing. Many local tycoons are intertwined with party of the PRC in many business ventures in Hong Kong, real estate being the most notable but there are others. 
The older generation was complicit in allowing this to occur, as they stood the most to gain, but since that economic growth after the 90s transition ran out of steam the cracks in the wall became obvious. 
To be honest, I'm actually proud of the HK citizens taking the risk they have to push back against to a totalitarian State. People need to realize that the plight of most of the nations in the greater China policy are not in favour of the situation, yet have to comply in order to try and survive; now that this is no longer an option, it just makes sense to they'd resist.  
As for as education, there were a few meetups that I saw over the years, but nothing looks to have really appealed to them. Most people from highly developed nations seldom do, and HK is one of the most expensive places to live on Earth.

If you're serious, we did this in 2014 during the Ukrainian protests in Kiev:
Essentially what occurred is what you'd imagine, a member of the community acted in good faith an accepted the funds sent to distribute on the ground (she was actually in Poland but had people on the ground); once the funds were converted onto a credir card (during capital controls no less) they purchased essentials: food, shoes, walky-talkys, generator for make-shift hospitals. 
The fact that you lived there and may know a 'trust-worthy' person/people there is half the battle.

I saw a 2017 Maxima, in 2017, with so much surface rust I couldn't believe it only had 12k miles. 
Even Infinitis have are being built to fleet car standard these days, I really despise Carlos Ghosn for what he has done to the reliable working man's car options: Sentra/Maxima/Altima. 
Those were amazingly reliable when they were built in Japan. I saw a 4DSC 5 speed badged Maxima from 92 with 220k on the odometer and only needed new rotors/pads and an oil change; the thing was idling like it was new, no weird surges. 
Honestly, Toyota is the better buy these days for 'bomb proof' cars and this is from a Die-Hard Nissan fan boy.

She is in this last State of the Onion talk at the CCC with Jacob talking about the project: 
I won't tarnish Jacob's name, as I think he is innocent, until proven otherwise--this is the same tactic used on Julian which got him where he is now. So use her name and start doing some legwork on your own. 
I'm willing to give the woman her credibility up until that speech, but I haven't heard anything since the removal of Jacob and it could have been a ploy to get her involved and have Jacob ostracized from the community. 
JAcob also announced he was putting TOR nodes in Museum(s) for culture and arts, that was kind of cool, too.

Well, we know Natasia is sound; not sure if she'd be up for acting as an escrow, but again the trouble is more the team on the ground; those Isrealis (led by a member here called Erogan or something along those lines) took a bunch of BTC with the proposed intent to help and never did anything with it to help Kiev at a time of great need. They contacted Natasia to help with their PR stunt, but she had none of it. 
I asked him what happen to it and was told he didn't know and had 'look into it' when the coins were still in the same wallet at the time. You can look through my post history to verify.

Keep away from adderall if that is the case, seriously. I saw too many on that stuff during my undergrad, it seems like a useful tool at first but it will have dire consequences when you try to function without it. We all looked like zombies during finals week, but those guys looked like they picked themselves out of the dumpster and shook themselves off before showing up to class/lab. They looked a lot like junkies. 
Flow-state can be achieved without substances, I personally had a foray with opioids in order to keep me in that state for studying, its not sustainable even if you go cold turkey or try to 'microdose' (your tolerance can go up way higher with even small/occasional use) like I used to after finals. That stuff is literal poison. Psychedilcs has a way better propensity for that in my view.

I remember when this was all the rage, she said in an interview that She and her father would have conversations regarding these topics... And while I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, as she is very clearly intelligent, grasping even 5% of the topics covered is unlikely. Maybe that's changed since then, but even so its very difficult to go amass that much information while going to mandated schooling and not lose your sanity doing so. (I think people negate how emotionally distressful this is, because misery porn has become so ubiquitous.)
It's more likely she has a very brief overview of the topics covered, and has some decent oratory skills--I personally was honing my skills in public speaking like this at 12 myself. I was self taught, but I began reading philosophy at that age and I realized oratory is a critical component that is neglected in modern 'schooling.' Its still odd to see a grown adult unable to get in from of a crowd and speak without a ton of anxiety to me, its like seeing the Human version of training wheels, and that they made it this far and only to never bother to take them off.
Anyhow, it's still impressive, but if you ask her to break down the implications of the fractional reserve banking system and the insolvency of the FDIC back in 2008 she probably couldn't tell you much, if anything, without being coached and allowed to research it first and even then it would be in something like a debate format rather than first hand experience.
Which as you said, if you had lived through that, it creates a great deal of anxiety and fear, and for some of us PTSD.
Sidenote: Her speech sounds super rehearsed, like the tonality is one of repetitive behaviour rather than free-flow of ideas, her breathing indicates it too. Something about her eyes does too, but I often avoid direct eye contact with my audience unless I absolutely am honing on a specific point of reference/audience member I'm trying to elicit a response from so that may just be a style thing. 
It usually results in them coming up to me afterward 80-90% of the time.

The name varied, because they used a korona, but you're right it had transitioned to the pengo by then when it hyperinflated in 45-46.
But to call it a forint isn't right either, that wasn't introduced until after 46 when the hyperinflation had hit its ATH.
Either way, semantics aside, my point was to stress that as a populace they must be well aware of the travesty of hyperinflation as their grandparents were likely survivors of it and can see the value of bitcoin.

I've spent time with the 'Enterprise' types trying to shoe-horn their way into this space and its abysmal trying to take them serious when they try to use their old ways of doing things in the hope they can ride the hype train and cash in. I really tried my best to laugh so hard I'd be asked to leave the room everytime I heard the words 'private blockchain' and 'solution' used in the same breath. It was... challenging. 
What was harder to explain was when they actually closed and on-boarded accounts with that narrative. Granted most were banks, who think they found some panacea to allow them to pretend and extend while facing an imminent, existential threat.
Had they simply decided to find capital to silently take a significant stake and position in the currency (think $10+ million @ \~3k) and maybe mine they'd be way better off than 90% of all startups/companys that have ever been started in ROI; look at 21, they really made all the right moves from a finance POV--that email thing was weird, but supposedly made money some how, so I guess it worked, too.

Say what you will about Abby's  misguided politics, but she was more a part of this movement in the early days than most here will ever be.
She gave lots of early Bitcoiners a platform to speak and reach out to others who, if they watched RT back then, were only exposed to your fucking loons like Max Kaiser. Later, Julian Assange's show would be another segue into it with the Cypherpunk show they had. And that Laurnen lyster chick did some segments, too. But she didn't really 'get it,' that much was obvious.
Personally, I had already gone down my 'rabbit hole' by then and went 'all in' as it were and had already things set in motion, but the Cypherpunk show on RT and Abby's Breaking the Set were my go-to to show other's who were tech savvy and crypto-curious why the tech mattered the most.

We've been here before, tainting coins does nothing but make them incapable of being directly sold on US/EU/AU based exchanges. 
The truth is coinjoin/mixing protocols were made for this and should be at the base layer by now as this will continue to happen. 
Since we already have a solution to that, what we should really place the focus on is the fucking ability for Fincen and OFAC to make a case on this claim, and how its fucking absurd:


No, that was merely the Free Market adding another agent in the manufacturing/distribution of a class of drug(s) that was oversubscribed by physicians onto patients, peddled through the sanctioned Hospitals, pharmacies and Medical system in the US who created the opioid crisis and the subsequent addictions. 
A system that is both regulated and administered by the US government via the AMA and its grossly corrupt licensure system and its obvious cozy relationship with Big Pharama. All of whom possess bank accounts in most major banks in the US. 
At worst, these guys merely cut into the profits of Perdue Pharama et al... 
So, no: Fuck you, FinCEN/OFAC go put chiefs of medicine and CEOs of big pharmaceutical corps in jail if you really want to make actual use of the Law for this epidemic and widespread misery. 
I always said, a Joe Jimenez is scarier than all the Pablo Escobars and El Chapos of the World put together, the former can send entire Nations to endless Wars abroad and use their respective branches of 'Law Enforcement' to go after Silk Road sellers/admins and give them Life in prison at home to ensure their monopolies. This holds true even when their very own agents succomb to theft/extortion/corruption while on said investigation and get a slap on the wrist. 
[On top of that these CEOs knew very well their drugs are highly addictive, and dangerous but understand that they can ultimately game the Legal system and exonerate themselves from these crimes](
What a sick and twisted World this can be sometimes.


The jokes on them, they already lost if that's their position: it was already better than any Swiss Bank account ever was when it was created and its only gotten better since 2009 and will continue to evolve.

Depends on what you mean by 'power,' personally speaking I'd get a low mile 06\-09 LS460 over just about anything that has been made in the last 10 years if Power, Comfort, Reliability was my only concern. Gas prices suck on a V8 if you daily it though, I speak from experience. And parts are rare and expensive for Lexus' if you decide to turn a wrench on it yourself.

Its a tormenting experience just writing a synopsis of it, how anyone would willingly torment themselves following it is beyond me.

Maybe not exactly the same thing, but consider the most recent event where the Government shut down and Federal workers were not being paid by the State. And how they had to resort to using food banks, and relying on charity almost immediately--despite having MUCH HIGHER SALARIES than your average private sector employees--what astonishes me is how these people are not seen as parasites on the very system we oppose is beyond me, yet they regard people on social safety nets as leeches.

Why do you think SpaceX is pushing as hard as it is for constellation. The need for an ISP-less internet connection is much dire than most are willing to accept. Meshnets provided another failsafe to an extent, but low latency/high speed data streams need to be in place if Society doesn't descend into the chaos you're alluding to, one in which I personally think Bitcoin cannot just survive in but will actually have the redundancies/contingencies (blockstream satelite etc...) in place to excel where most other currencies cannot.

That's chump change to major retailers for a POS, with standalone payment processing especially with built in LN support it could eventually pay for itself in short time if you're dealing with financial censorship and high enough volume. Also you could just outsource a monthly subscription for tech support for who ever installs it--I had a similar role in my startup as a founder, which meant CTO/Account Exec/Manager. (Actually Casa offers it with their membership.)
Personal anecdote: my customers were moving thousands of dollars in single txs, with B2B stuff, so this solves several key issues with the mechanics at least.
You fancy yourself some tech savvy person, so it should be clear that this isn't for you, so go build one yourself; for others with more discretionary funds for their operation, and business and are constrained with limited time, this falls well within an acceptable price point. 
Also, its $300 if you buy now if you read the article.
Essentially, the point that you're missing is we're no longer in the 'look at me, I can do it all' crypto-nerd phase of adoption anymore--believe me, I know... I was there, so 'been there, done that.' 
It was fun, and you missed the boat for your 2 mins of fame/glory, though.

I'm not saying I understand all of it, in fact I've spent most of my evening trying to dismantle it as I have been watching those since early Summer as I recall the Umbrella Revolution back in 2014 quite acutely, but the truth is HK is in the dark ages in terms of Fintech it seems, despite its reputation in the financial World.


Quite the opposite, they are in mass revolt to ensure they don't fall prey to the living conditions most of the World have resigned themselves to. Maybe you are not aware, but that is is litterly the most expensive place to live on Earth, the land cannot be owned by anyone by the Government, and they allot it fir 50 years to major multi-national corps (many from mainland China) and charge upwards of 50x of wages for a home.
This is the norm in Hong Kong for the youth:
Hong Kong is a real example of a Cyberpunk dystopia, masked with some consumer utopia veneer for the rich, which makes it even more scary; but the truth is its really a fucking dark place for most of the population. And they learned from 2014 as to how fast they will crack down on civil unrest.
The youth in particular are showing a remarkable amount of temerity, because while most of those around the World that are their age are glued to some ADHD sounding social media 'influencer,' these guys are trying to fight for their Future and taking it to the streets if need be.

To be honest, Gen Z needs to be on boarded asap, and as an environmentalist with a background in Biology as well as sustainable Energy/Auto/Ag I wouldn't mind outlining the points that make it not just the most sound and trust worthy form of currency running on the most secure netowrk, but also as we have seen in last year's research paper, its actually the most environmental: as its essentially advancing renewable energy sources as it is creating an incentive structure and being powered by 80% renewable energy.  Something no other tech let alone Nation State based fiat system can say.
I would also point to her the narrative of Greenhouse emissions is nothing short of a race between current and former Empires building and maintaining their realms of influence and economic might around the World: US DoD and PRC/CCP Industrialization and catastrophic use of fossil and nuclear based energy to rapidly Industrialize at all costs and its soft colonization in Africa.
The State is the crux of the issue, places like Chile, Denmark and Iceland cannot be overlooked in the equation but their achievements are on the extreme fringe, most Nation States can and do commit Ecocide, as do large Corps, but the former often is never indicted for the crime as it has decreed itself Sovereign an exempt of criminal punishment and negligence.

That's a very Western ideology, one that's its very civilization is built upon but one I will admit has since been eroded and lost in most of the West as well. I think this is what distinguishes Eastern and Western culture and philosophy the most.
I think the 'legal' system has proven itself to be illegitimate and revolt has been made inevitable since the first Umbrella revolution in 2014. The horrid living conditions of the youth/elderly poor, and economic stagnation and unemployment just fuel the fire. In many ways, I think this looks more like Greece 2008 than anything since then, and I'm proud to say that I feel direct solidarity for the young citizens who with a great deal of courage have decided to undertake this and feel their shouts for a 'Free Hong Kong' deeper than words can convey.  
You say 'we,' so I presume you too have taken action on these matters in protest? Do you have any first hand experience with this situation from that level?
I wish them well, and hope that we can use this technology to further encourage Freedom Fighters to have access to financial services even when denied or having them survialed as an act of intimidation from the State.
Personal observation: Taiwan is next to revolt against the CCP.

Never underestimate the incompetence of bureaucracy, they may seem omnipotent from the surface, but once you delve into its mechanics you will see that it is mainly comprised of imbeciles, useful idiots, and short-sighted sociopaths. None likely to delve into such matters unless they are either directly instructed to and provided it doesn't interfere with their daily routines. 
With that said, I'd prefer it remain as such, cloaking yourself by placing yourself in open view is perhaps the best way to remain operational.

That's unfortunate for the owners of this fire... But I can't help but be astonished that we created a technology and network that we can monitor with such great analytics and can correlate this event with a decrease in hash rate on the network in real time to validate its likelihood of having occurred.
Imagine how that'd even be possible in the fiat World with banks or central banks. 
We've built a seriously ingenious network.

While amazing when you really think back to how this all started, this is/has now become par for the course as the tech matured; Bitcoin (mining) has essentially been subsidizing a large amount of investment into renewable energy around the World.

As a community we need to get the UX and security thing down, because I think 'the masses' are ready to not just listen but outright adopt. Education here is critical, but having undertaken a challenge like this before, I know its possible.
Having been an environmental activist and proponent of sustainability I always felt this tech was the ideal choice for non Nation-State based societies, the question was always: when?
So, with People like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion, and the Umbrella Revolution II on the rise (thankfully!) now is the time for us to present our message for the way finance should be done, but also prove that it was environmentally suited to do so far beyond any other alternative. To me that has always been a critical attribute, though we can also do much more in that respect.
Believe me: this narrative is not going anywhere, these kids should be pissed off, and now their are actions to back it all up.
Now that we have our scaling issues mostly sorted its now time to think what non-tech, but passionate and motivated, people would need to make this their currency of choice.

This is also known as Hyper-Bitcoinization, the issue, amongst many others I won't outline here, is the messy transition to this state from the Fiat based one. 
Its going to be a fucking tragic World in the interim as we do it, but the fiat World is a cancer on Humanity and on the Planet, and we have to grow through this to be cured of a metastatic cancer plaguing the Earth.
My main problem is when it comes to long-term projects; how will this impact nations with Aerospace challenges that are measured not in political cycles but in decades, if not centuries? 
Things like Mars Colonization are not bought or sold on the idea of a World with decentralized Currencies being the norm, though that may be the intended, goal... but rather, one of a National Space Race, and if Governments cannot or will not fulfill that role, I think we may return to the Dark Ages of non-progress in that respect despite having made so much progress in such a a short time: its starting to be within our grasp. 
I wish we were adept enough to do it anyway, but I'm not in favour of this occurring until we get a Human settlement on Mars.

Lets get this perfectly clear:
Logic, as you say, is uniquely absent when it comes to Human conduct when it functions within Identity Politics and subsequently the Human folly when it seeks to consolidate Wealth or Power. That much is clear throughout Modern Human History, and its a recurring theme most never seem to learn from.
The Human condition is very basic and predictable when you observe its core directives, survival being its chief mode of operation will make the most well intentioned person rationalize some of the most atrocious acts if it it ensures their survival. I have heard first person anecdotes of people who survived WWII and some of the subsequent genocides that came after it, despite the narrative Jews were not the only ones targeted mind you, and they all speak of the same horrors that always follow after the Fabric of Society (illusion) is torn before their very eyes.
You can say whatever you want about the transition of the theoretical 'enlightened ones,'  but most Libertarians will always side more within the Left or Right paradigm (false dichotomy) then they ever will with Anarchists: Why?
They still want the State to intervene where they see fit, Anarchists want to do away with the very notion of the State--and we see most of Human misery deriving from it.
We as Anarchists may ultimately differ in how we go about it, and that's fine as I'm all for experimentation, but I have worked and lived amongst Anarcho-communists/socialists (as an 'AnCap') and despite my opinion(s) on their misguided ideals of said social mechanics, we have more in common then we ever could with a so-called Limited Government touting 'Libertarian.'
Sidenote: I was one of the few anarchists within the 2007-08 Campaign for Liberty, I have seen your types up close and personal. I stand by my argument then and now.

Depending on what and how you live, 1500 quid after taxes will only allow for so much savings (assuming that's monthly income) so, I'd drop 3300 and leave the rest to offset expenses in the future, allowing you to do the DCA strategy.
Saving a tenner here and some more later gets harder as you will encounter non-foreseeable living expense, so its best to have close to 1/2 your savings on hand if need be.
1 BTC is totally do-able with DCA, it just requires patience and discipline. At 6 months I'd re-evaluate your position by determining what your goals are are in relation to your expenses/savings, and do that until you get to what you want.

We don't need more Media personalities trying to score good soundbites, we need solutions and integration onto Layer 2.  
This statement alone is incredibly pointless, the US Treasury tokenizing the USD makes no sense, the Petro and such are just exactly what you'd expect from such an undertaking. 
No one uses it, and it will be a waste of time as its still functioning within that paradigm. The displacement of nation-state based Fiat is the goal, not trying to transition it one form to another because that is just some fetishization of this tech without understanding what its goal actually is: Crypto-Anarachy.

I'm all for street demos at first, but you only get so far with that and a longer term form resistance needs to be thought of to obtain sovereignty and independence from the CCP.

I'm not sure I want to ask, but I can't help myself: What exactly is 'tax justice?' 
I'm trying to envision someone advocating for FAANG to pay their 'fair share' and help funds things like medicare/medicade... but the tax code was literately built for large corporate partnerships with the State for its own benefit (fascism). 
With that said, I refuse to accept their could ever be anything resembling 'justice' in taxation, unless I can choose specifically where my portion of stolen funds are directed towards. I'd gladly pay for local schools/libraries and apprenticeship programs, as well as water and air purification infrastructure but I'm fully aware most of my extorted funds (read: taxes) goes towards an untenable welfare and warfare State policy in which the daily accrued interest is in the billions.
And just so its clear, a lot of us early bitcoiners are actually Anarchists: not Libertarians.

They have been eating 'shitty' despite their new found wealth, organic food was taboo, and mainly made in secret and privately held greenhouses for a long time; China destroyed a ton of its farmland in their development, they're now having to spend upwards of $500 Billion to remediate the soil to keep up with the demands of its populace in the long term, and buying up farms in OZ and outright passive colonization of nations in Africa.
As to the 'financial tier' system you speak of: this what strikes me the most, its not as though this system serves them well, its just less bad than what they started with, which often is abject poverty in a rural town for the most part. But its not as though its desirable, let alone sustainable if you look at it objectively. Their is a cost to pay, and it ultimately ends in polluted food/water/air. They may be heavily investing in renewable, but its hard to gauge how much longer that can go for before it leads to massive levels of chronic diseases being the norm.

A country, as in the Government, has no role in ensuring employment in anything but an abject tyrannical despotic system--the result is always dark, as in the case with Soviet Union where unemployment was 0% and anyone who resisted their role(s) were sent to gulags or slave camps. Any government capable of giving employment has the power to take it away as well, thus it always leads to a form subservience to the State: be it covert or overt, the result is always the same. Oddly enough, I came to find out this applied even in a country like Switzerland, with all its lore of Freedom and Citizen Rights, could do this to its own populace.  
At best a Government's role should be limited to ensuring a clear legal landscape codified through its legal system and maintaining it's credit worthiness in the World by means of a sound currency; but the fact that a country like the US (with its huge advantage in post WWII) got it so wrong goes to show that its an empirical fallacy that any Nation-State can do it at all.
The American Century and its subsequent exceptionalism is an inherent quality of the modern Human Condition when it attains Power, this must first be done away with if we are to move past this.

I would have capitalized on that fear and nervousness and brought him up to speed on post Segwit progress; I think what they really fear is what they cannot understand, they understand monetization of tech, and that would have been enough to convert him in my opinion.

What in Nature is actually Centralized is capable of existing long enough to be either relevant (albeit in short windows) and a solid foundation for it's (questionable) utility or use other than Man's machinations  (eg Nation States) or some dystopian pheromone induced mind-control hierarchies like with Ants?
I'll overlook at the supposed 'sustainable' merits of the latter and focus on the former for brevity's sake:
Centralized-centric mentality is directly a core part of his thesis of what makes Homo Sapiens so effective at (initially) undertaking large complex systems (community/monolith construction/religions/society) if I understood his position correctly. They subsequently tend to atrophy and break down as they fragment while they grow.
But Nature and by extension Life itself by its sheer design (DNA/RNA based Lifeforms) requires spontaneity for it to be resilient, not uniformity--Evolution requires constant mutation from external stimuli to adapt to an environment and by extension a Universe in constant flux--neither of which are static/monolithic/centralized or stagnant: those have a tendency to go extinct rather quickly.
It was a good book, I should re-visit it again soon as its been a while (2016?) since I finished it in a few weeks and probable didn't take it all in. I'd like to look specifically to this part as I don't recall this 'techno-utopian/technocrat will save us all from peril' premise he brought up in the image posted; because other than Musk's many ventures no one else comes to mind who is making any headway in that direction without immense resistance from the State and its many corporate appendages--and even then that has always been a challenge to some degree for SpaceX and Tesla.
What page is this on, again?
With that said, Mankind really does have a rare and unique opportunity  in this short-lived window to achieve something that could potentially lead to a new Evolution of our very Species, the only real question is will we have the self-awareness to have it come to fruition?
We're likely going to be a multi-planetary Species in our Lifetime, which could potentially bring about a Global prosperity (and hopefully consciousness) that seems unfathomable and too immense to really comprehend and yet we still have the archaic notions of Nationality, Sex or Race dividing us and fomenting hatred within Governments/Legislation and are acutely channeled through Universities where young mind's should go to hone their skills and learn to Dream and be inspired about the Future they envision and wish to create, not to waste this amazing time being portrayed as the source of, or the victim of, someone's trite diatribe about 'oppression.'

Google got away with paying low tax rates as it was incorporated in Ireland, and Holland who due to its shrinking (and crippled in the case of the former) economy in the EU had to do anything to lure it to come somehow. 
How they can do that for large corps, and let its citizenry deal with horrid unemployment and high taxation is just one of the many reasons why the State should be seen as the Mafia that it is. 
I'm not sure how UBI will ultimately be funded, but I appreciate the idea of it being explored, but a VAT system is not novel nor really effective (as seen with the NHS in the UK) however, it might encourage savings. I've lived in the EU and its hit/miss, especially if you don't get any of the benefits of said taxation. I do like how they include VAT taxes in their prices, though. 
The problem is the US is the largest consumer Market in the World and it literately is fueled by consumption, so a surplus in savings sounds good on paper (specifically if it retains its World reserve currency status) but it will likely ensure massive downsizing of businesses and thus dwindling employment opportunities in anything but the largest corps who can function with thin profit margins--I think prior to 2008 the largest employer(s) in the US were still small privately held businesses, now I don't think most have the luxury to choose if the want to be employed at all.  And the idea of Welfare assistance while having FT work is a stark reality for many who do choose that route.

As much as I'd like to see that happen, I don't think users would be able to manage their own accounts successfully. 
Square is really good for end users mainly because it takes out the guess work for them, and has tech support. I can't see (many if any) of them using Square/Cash while running their own node, managing their own wallet and the conversion their-in unless its all completely automated : I just can't. 
Most small businesses don't want to be their own bank, to my personal dismay, and quite frankly until they scale enough to justify it, they don't want an accountant/AR-AP person on staff to manage it all, in my personal experience.

Drop in personal Citizen score for sure and a decrease in the scores of all your social networks peers is my guess--they'll pressure you into paying with stigmatization. 
Their was this add-on feature to one of those apps I saw recently that notified you that someone was in debt, and you could report them if you found them to be splurging as though they were otherwise. Equihax fucking sucks, but turning your very own populace into vindictive rats is just a recipe for a return to absolute totalitarianism. I'm convinced China wants to do a 21st century version of the Soviet Union at this point.
Its creepy fucking shit, but the Chinese are going for it full steam ahead; I'm not sure even BTC can help such an indoctrinated culture at this point. Its like a glossed version of a dystopian society in a Cyberpunk book.


You should watch the talk at this year's CCC on Alipay and Wechat's role with seaseme credit system; the speaker did her graduate degree(s) in China and apparently they've been trying the 'negative re-enforcement' approach with Westerner's at Chinese Universities for some time, even when bringing sexual partners to their dorms: It didn't work.
Its like some 21st century form of the scarlet letter to the Chinese, but most Westerner's just tried to rack up the most violations as a badge of honor.
\&gt;I would flip my shit if they tried something like this over here.
Why do you think the Big Data and all the FAANG's have been jumping on this like its the next gold rush for more than half a decade? It won't be long until you see some variation of this showing its face in the West as cash is being displaced out the system.,

Agreed. I think we reached the point where most users who are tech savvy have already onboarded, to reach the the reminder of our (potential) user-base we will have to simplify the UX to such a degree that they do not even know they are using Bitcoin.

With no (assumed) real property rights in place in the Soviet Union, how was home ownership designated after the collapse? Were you in Russia proper or one of the satellite nations?
I ask because I remember an interview with Suboi when asked about how Communist Vietnam didn't really have home deeds either, so after the War most people just assumed anyone living in those homes were just the rightful owners.
But she wrote a song about how sometime in the 2000s as things were modernizing the State started to demand they provide proof of ownership, or face eviction, but many families simply didn't have any and the grandparents had been deceased for some time.
I had a friend who was the sole descendant of a large amount of property in rural  (then) Yugoslavia, which was socialist not communist, but after the collapse and the father's death they were unable to do much other than lease the land out to local farmers while she went to the city to work. The local government and all the neighbors knew of this family as they've been their for centuries, but still... this is a lot more common than most think and was once thought to be something blockchain could resolve. The issue was enforceability, but now as a governments are acknowledging BTC's Blockchain for convictions for things liek money laundering, the argument can be made that it too must be admissible to support a claim to land/home, right?
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:24:39
Hmm... I think this an absurd argument to make if taken at face value, mainly because its a non-issue that doesn't really need to be explained.
But remind me... who is it that is pretty much the face of LN and just spoke with Jack Dorsey on a podcast with high praise and received funding from him to help roll out layer 2? Seems to me that the metric to truly measure things by in our ecosystem is not the sheer quantity of females in this space, but rather the quality of the females we do have that matters most. Starkbot does an amazing job, and she understands this ecosystem better than most males in my experience, too.
The thing I like the most about BTC, and crypto in general, is that unlike  the rest of Tech this is truly a meritocracy, or the closest thing to it.
It doesn't matter if you're a large holder of coins or just a new comer with an amazing idea for a BIP: what you do in this ecosystem matters the most and is usually what you're ranked upon. There have been unnecessary witchunts by the trolls around here, but try to find someone (that matters anyhow) talk ill of Finney, Back or Szabo, hell I think even NullC is up there now.

Yeah, that is crazy, but aren't there cultural norms in Russia that you stay home until you marry. And sometimes even after that in most of the country? Its typical to have 3-4 generations in a home in a lot of Europe, provided it can support the family size(s). And for a lot of its History when the opportunity arises its common to buy a home nearby, but with the modern economy and the limited opportunies for the youth, traveling and moving away from home for work is a must so it likely contributes to that squeeze on housing supply as it is in the Urban US.
I didn't know that about Russia during the crisis. Thanks for the insight. 


Those are usually the first things that get compromised in revolutions/coups, and the State can selectively destroy things for land grabs. Especially if its an enterprising despot that took power who is looking to sell land for resources to multi-nationals for a cash stream. 
Normally, I would agree, as enforceability means having some type of private force to take the land back with force if needed if the arbitration system fails you, but as many local governments are experimenting with it (pay taxes and such) its actually rather interesting development that may lead to it being recognized. Its still early days, of course. 
Having a timestamp and a hashed version of a notarized contract is possible now on the blockchain, but how to get people to accept that is valid without the private army is like the 'last mile' dilemma, as it were.

Its a good option, and one that helps support Square/Dorsey who is a huge BTC proponent within traditional Fintech, and has helped accelerate adoption--he is currently seeking to fund dedicated core devs that work independently from Square/Cash.
With that said, its not an exchange, so do not expect the services and amenities that they offer. If all you are seeking is a easy to use onramp, than hands down its the best in the business. Obviously if you do not transfer to your own wallet where you contril the keys you only have an IOU, not actual BTC.
For 'trading,' its only ok; I'm not sure which exchange they are using to monitor their spot prices, it can often be off by XX's of dollars from Binfinex so that's not it. The buy and sell fees reflect that it isn't an exchange as they have mark up when you buy and when you sell.
The delay to get your funds into USD, unless you use thier instapay fee, varies from 2-5 days in my experience depending on what day of the week/holiday, too.
Overall, I'm satisfied with it as a product; it can obviously use some refinement and additional features, but its helping accelerate adoption and creating a profitable crypto related business model for Square who are help a great deal of small businesses conduct business everyday.
I envision the day we see all of these guys get onboarded with LN enabled payment channels will occur in the near future with existing hardware and a software update.
They are THE coinbase killer in my opinion.

Actually, it makes perfect sense for a home cook, look at the browning on that sized steak, who do you know other than professional chefs has a pan that large to get a nice sear on it, this is ideal for a stand alone unit you don't have to worry about being beat up or causing to smoke in the house as you can just plug it outside instead of having to use a broiler and hope you get those results, which is not as easy as you make it seem with house equipment for the home cook, its doable, just far from ideal. 
With that said, having to open and close an oven to check for the readiness of a piece of a meat is pita, especially if you're dealing with such expensive cuts. Let alone the clean up in cooking steaks in a broiler. (A part of me died when I found out 1/2 of kitchen work is just simply cleaning.)
Honestly, dude this is the equivalent of a higher end toy for the kitchen, something you'd see at sharper image, and $900 is cheap for cooking equipment and if it helps support some manufacture who also enjoys Bitcoin enough to put it on his device, why the fuck not? If he said he likes it, its clearly because he takes great joy in doing just that: cooking. Don't belittle someone because they don't understand things in a condescending manner, that's so lame.
Because quite honestly, after time and tons of experience, I don't even need to put my meat in an oven to get it to a perfect medium rare with an amazing sear, I go solely by smell and touch with a pan and foil despite having an array of industrial sized convection ovens, salamanders, flat top and normal grills.

This. You have to understand the poverty rate of rural China (and its a big fucking place!) to even begin to understand it, the increase in quality of life is substantial; most peasant subsistence farmers send their children to the city to work in factories to support their families back home. Eventually, they end up at your foxxcon's and such, but this is a huge leap in standard of living for them compared to where they are from. This is why the tout the rise of China as the biggest elevator of poverty in the 21st Century, but it comes at a cost, a really big one. But if you're feeding 5 family members back home and some of them are ill, you don't have time to ask questions. We all know how big the remittances market is internationally, China is no different but they're within its borders.
Simply put, I've seen this in the US, too. And one can argue this is exactly what happened post WWII with the boomers, one the largest increases in standard of living came at a cost: Nuclear proliferation, Military Industrial complex, Global US Imperialism, near constant and perpetual War, the rise of Intelligence agencies that target their own Society in addition to those abroad etc... The same thing applies here.
Prior to Snowden you were considered a crazy person for thinking about what the NSA does so broadly, and the FAANG's very close relationship with the State; I mean who the fuck didn't think Myspace/FB was just a massive aggregator of personal information made fashionable by anyone with power who would want to surveil their populace, if you had some background in Cypherpunk-Cryptoanarchy philosophy. And most people STILL use it despite those revelations to this day!
Anyhow, I think its too broad to paint a picture of those 'myopic Chinese citizens,' though Mainland Chinese are seriously the worst tourists in my experience, it think its more  a byproduct of confining wealth creation and upward mobility to a Nation-State who are subject to the propaganda and indoctrination I alluded to before.

You can search for them in my post history if you want to look for them; the last one was about how bio-mimicry and symbiosis is a critical part of any sustainable model for Life and that much like the symbiotic relationship between trees and mycelium to create the largest single organism on the planet, Humans are finally creating a mode of operation, that if successful, will allow us to not just conduct commerce through more sensible incentives, but perhaps change the Human Condition altogether and change how we interact with Nature, our Environment and its many vital complex ecosystems, and in time other Planet(s) we will colonize.
Which to date for Modern Human's is fucking atrocious and in dire need of change.

That was a nice soundclip, which is probably a good source of media buzz, so over all I'm satified; but all of IBM's architecture is built on Hyperledger and they think token based systems like Bitcoin are only for nefarious purposes where 'anonymity' is only needed.

It's what Ferarrista's are called in Maranello/Monza, its literately a cult. Motorsports is everything, they are people who grew up hearing the sounds of the engines from the factory and Fiorano and racing up Torre Maina  (where I lived and worked, most of my daily bookings were ragazzaiti form Ferarri staying the night) so, its ingrained in them. 
Context: Stefano Domenicali was a poor local kid watching over the fence(s) and volunteering to just clean the track after a test shake-down, he eventually became Team boss during the Alonso era in F1.
But to expand on what I meant: Giancarrlo was the ex-mayor of Maranello and had deep ties to the the Ferrari family itself. Enzo adopted his orphaned mom during WWII. He could tell you every fucking suspension setup that was used on every F1 chassis from the Ascari to the Alonso era if you got him going as he spent as much time fixated on. He worshiped everything Ferrari, but it was cooler when we got to talk about food and aerospace stuff if I'm honest.

If done at ATH it makes perfect sense, from solely a custodial point of view, to ensure they had enough cash reserves to cover all possible future claims. 
But this is yet another reason why we don't need regulators, nor States and their court systems getting involved in Crypto, that amount of coins in the hands of the State, however well meaning it may convince you it is, is the antithesis of why BTC was created and needed in the first fucking place. 
I feel bad for those that lost out, and I've even come to feel bad for Karpelles over time; but at this point what is best is for this to just be over with and have those coins return into the Market, and if the claimee's never see their coins that is just the collateral damage we have to accept that as a consequence of BTC's growing pains.

Holy fuck! I had a dream of something like this in the early days (like 2012??) about a situation in which people of semi-abandoned town who were entirely  dependent on hydo-generated electricity from snow melt that had a access to large mining operations, like more than Bitman, and would out pace anyone on the network on a seasonal basis that allowed them and their children to invest their time and resources on more profitable endeavours in Life, including education, tech, engineering,  medicine, aerospace and Ag.
I wrote a few chapters by 2015 of what that would look like as a novel-manga... I got to the part of setting up a meshnet and the miners, I think; sadly those HDDs are likely dead by now. But may be a cool thing to pick up again as I have pretty much the synopsis of it in my head.
[Well, I guess this is how BTC mining has come to be powered by 85% renewable energy.](

Given that the names have been relegated to non-relevent terms in that time, I think its best to deem these 'currencies' as products under the umbrella of a well recognized brand. So as the Pound Sterling and US dollar moved away from PM backing, so have the end products deviated from the original. Consider that the word Yen outside of its currency context, just means Circle or a round object in Japanese.
The current GBP and USD are like the crystal coke of currencies, and they too will pass into obsolescence in time.
I think all other currencies are worst off then these 2, though; and the GBP having the most absurd valuation as the UK's economic output is pathetic is not lost one me, they'd starve to death in a matter of months if they have to feed their population without outside Ag goods (Brexit is good, but only because it precipitates the end of the EU) despite all the lofty rhetoric.

Wishful thinking, hence why social media is still a thing, and still a big part of what the internet is used for by the majority people on it. It'd be nice if that did occur, but this assumes that Humans are rational beings, which has proven throughout History to not be the case, I'm afraid.

Or illiterate peasant, cult (christian) extremists that burned down the Library of Alexandria and set back Humanity for millennia. We still haven't recovered from that.
Those are valid concerns to have, and my views have shifted from thinking hyperbitcoinization was ideal at all costs given how fucked the system was to now seeing how the real metric for success can really only be if we have a semi-seamless transition from one to another--there bound to be blowback, but containing it is imperative. Such that the average person wouldn't even know there was a change unless they took interest in the mechanics of it. Which most won't.
Its not enough to decouple from State based fiats anymore, but rather how to migrate from one system to another without having total collapse from hyperinflation like we've seen so many times since BTC was launched around the World.
Lots of work to do until we reach that point, but I'm more positive than ever that its possible.

Haven't we seen that tx and ownership cannot be stopped enough times around the World to know this is a hollow threat, even in the event that it did pass?
I'm entirely convinced this is some bank/law firm/ lobbying firm collusion paying politicians to try and push this so that they create controversy in the ecosystem, maybe put some shorts to profit from the FUD, and can later say they were able to repeal it and have some relevance in this space.
We've got blockstream satelites, LN nodes, decentalized exchanges like BISQ and ideally some meshnet projects to support these if need be: I say, do your worst, and watch it not work and see why this network was built in the first place.
That's how we should be addressing this as a community, clearly nothing changes from following a legislative process and they'll just be back again if/when it fails. 
Where are those people who were elated a pro-Bitcoin Governor was elected now? 
On a positive note, this may finally help us get rid of Coinbase if true. Then, again, would Square/Cash app abandon BTC support... hmm.

The tolerances for the people you are describing for less than good practices aren't as rigid as you make it seem, regardless of your claim.
Hence, why all the exit scams/goxxing things have occurred over the years, with that said, after the last goxxing and the fact that we saw wide spread reluctance from all exchanges to publish proof of full reserves I just assume anyone stupid enough to leave their money on exchanges deserves to have their funds stolen. I think day traders (who are the only ones with a semi justifiable reason to keep funds on exchanges, are the free riders/leeches of the ecosystem. They aren't the Market makers they think they are, as bots have far out weighed their efforts years ago.
So to them I say, its been 10 years so there is no excuse at this point, its very simple: not your keys, not your fucking coins.

Yes. There is no way to hold actual BTC on the cash app itself, there are no private keys; thus, you're unable to sell that position withing their system. You can, however, sell the 'non-btc' you purchase from them rather seamlessly. I've played with it, its really easy.
Your confusion is proving my point further here... I'm not really trying to sound mean, but this is why I think your position is so irritating, you never really looked into it. You just fabricated some claims to suit your own ignorant slant of what it does and doesn't do.

@_date: 2019-02-06 00:41:20
The truth is when BTC has wide spread adoption, most people won't even know what/how it works, much like the current economic model we're trying to subvert. If we're truly successful most won't even know anything changed.
You place too much value in the average person's understanding of a subject/object/theory in order for them to utilize it daily use and at wide scale. Best example is electricity, a computer or an ICE in a car. Amazing feats of engineering reduced to a simple and easy to use UI to achieve an intended goal for the end-consumer.
While this has an edgy bend to it, I just find it amusing after all these years seeing and hearing (younger) Amir, it brings back good memories of a better time in this community. At least it reminds us that we shall never forget that it was these 'unacceptable' Cryptoanarchist and Cypherpunks who built this despite the legacy and enterprise on-comers from the 'mainstream' trying to make it seem otherwise.

Tell that to Venezuelans, Libyans, Syrians, Ukrainians, Argentinians, Turks, Cypriots... I can go on.
I think you'll find they all felt and understood why these things matter very quickly when your currency collapses and capital controls are imposed. Especially as war often follows.
I don't care for what the Gate's foundation says or tries to do at this point other than directing some  funds into cool projects in this space. They're already too late to impose their M$ mode of operation and have it make any dent, look at Stellar/Ripple no one gives a fuck about it and what ever use-cases it may have are realistically made moot with a little bit of understanding of the LN. Ideally we get more seamless apps to make it easier, but overall this whole scalability and cost per tx argument that makes BTC impractical will be solved.
With that said, her narrative probably went over well, but I figure most people watching that show probably thought she meant something like Applepay or Samsungpay or the like as she makes no reference to any cryptocurrency and only the power of the smart phone or even the dumb phone in the case of M-pesa.
By the way, its hard to swallow how engendered these figures have become about the sex of their intended user when making the case for solutions for the poor or underrepresented. It's like they think they have quantified suffering and think it sales better and makes for a better hook when told from a certain narrative, which is odd at best and gross at worst.

I've given this a great deal of thought these past years as the community's attitude changed vastly after it broke 1k, and I've come to the conclusion that while the pre-2013 community and the mentality that followed it is by far the minority, it still exists and is still the driver of some of the best projects in this space.
If all you do is hang out here, and never go to a meetup or hacker-spaces than your view will ultimately be skewed to reflect that.
I'm not sure something like Satoshi Forest, and the amazing out-pour the community had with it, would fly would it be tried at this time but I think those of us that were around back then always knew that if this were to become what we needed it to be, we had to on onboard the average individual, who as you mentioned only cares about it as an investment vehicle. And that's to be expected.
Bitcoin never lost its Cypherpunk and Cryptoanarchist core, and this is just a matter of optics if you delve into it, but if you want proof just look into BTC's involvement in just these recent events: Ukraine Maidan Revolution, Venezuela's hyperinflation and currency collapse. Nopara's work with Wasabi is a good privacy project, as is Samurai's work in that space. Starkbot and the Lightening lab's Team is helping build a 'privacy default' system with Lightening network and is the most compelling part of the 2nd layer.
In short, the maxims outlined in Bitcoin's White paper is and have always outlived any FUD/Hardfork BS if you look close enough.
Moreover, as a person who was called 'crazy' on the BTF in the 'good old days' for what I thought BTC could do back in 2011, only to see Mega corps like IBM adopt 'Blockchain' do just that; who I eventually joined for a period due to my background, so I think its absurd to rely on (perceived) public sentiment to dictate your path forward with this tech.
So, I think I can say with some experience that its best to just go and make the progress you want to see (and subsequently fail and then continue to iterate) in this ecosystem rather than try to convince and wait for others to follow your message or ideas. I think that's what Opensource technology allows.
Ultimately, if you do succeed people will take notice and will ask how to get involved.
I'll take this current stage with a vast array of promising progress and a more somber online community tone rather than the crazy hey-days we had back then with no real idea of how we'd get there, if I'm honest; if I want my dose of enthusiastically crazy optimism, I'll just to hang out with Aerospace and EV people.

We all are, but that's no reason not to get excited to see such exponential rises in capacity, remember it was only about a year ago that this was a project that Elizabeth said not to put really coins onto. 
It shows just how remarkably fast we can scale something thought to have been years away in this ecosystem.

Ok, this would be a total witchhunt they could never accomplish, hell the IRS can't even keep staff after not getting paid, and retaining those that did to stick it out and get things done while they take on tons of backlog  this year without them leaving or burning out seems like an impossibility as tax collectors were severally affected from this last shutdown, possibly for years according to these sources:

Here's the thing: this is likely to happen each and every time you use one of those. 
The convenience of having a Visa or MC logo on that thing is an indication of this occurring. It was Wavecrest killing off all those cards before that, too. Every time we try to insert that payment network into this space we seriously always end up back here, with even more backlash--though I'd argue the Wavecrest closure was bigger. 
This is why we needed to get Layer 2 with LN up and running asap, and onboard merchants that way to take it directly. I speak from experience when I say that anytime Visa or MC is involved: always assume this is going to happen. 
Its not random, its deliberate; we're gate crashing their monoplistic party, and this is the way the retaliate. There will always be short windows of operation in which their partners can obscure what it is that they are doing, but they will inevitably find out, and the last thing we should be doing is building on a system that relys on it, rather than creating infrastructure to rout around it.
I've come to realize, after all these years of using those cards, that when you sacrifice security for (perceived) convenience we forget why this tech was invented in the first place. And ultimately are left with a significant setback.
I just hope for your sake you have access to funds beyond what you loaded on that card, or at least someone back home that can send you some if needed.

Its not just terrible for the retailer/merchant is horrid for the end user to; in 2008 during the financial crisis when a lot of banks were consolidated they bought the outstanding debt from the CC holders of a insolvent bank.
[The most noticeable in the US was JP Morgan (illegally) buying out WaMu with the help of the insolvent FDIC in 2008, in what was at the time the biggest Bankruptcy in US History]( I have personal experience with this and could go into great detail, but suffice it say that we're really seeing the limitations of a consumer based society, the predatory practices of the banking sector is an acute symptom of it. Those we need to address, especially if, as most of us once desired, a post-scarcity society is to come into fruition with the advent of automation/asteroid mining/Mars colonization etc...
CC weren't a failure, so much as an experiment, and we've gathered significant info and data that suggests that they can be just as reckless as any financial instrument in the hands of predatory banks [who inflated this bubble to over a trillion dollars in the US alone with the QE and cheap money loans to keep this facade going](
So why we keep trying to coax that old model into crypto is baffling, having been guilty of it myself, but its only because we're trying to onboard an uniformed client with tools from the legacy system they are familiar with, rather than taking the time to educate them in masse ourselves.

That's an optimistic take on what was quite clearly what BTC was supposed to avert; I still cannot wrap my head around the delusional Nature of non-anarchic views of BTC as a financial instrument  destined to be used to replicate the same BS that made the World's Economy collapse. 
As for OP's question: Fractional Reserve Banking. 
Tether, Bakkt, whatever may come after it are a ponzi scheme, its creation is a reflection of who we're dealing with in the Space: Snake oil salesmen trying to convince you the volatile World of fiat you just tried to leave is worth pegging your BTC to. Why exactly is that useful to anyone? 
Moreover, I've asked before but I will ask again to the traders among you: what assurances do we have that they cannot manipulate the price of BTC across the board with these instruments? Because while I welcome these low prices n order to get more, I think its clear that a consolidation of coins is a big concern for anyone not already in this space.

*you could trade with miners on forums for their coins for whatever price  they wanted. Which thankfully back then was less than a penny a coin.  So yes you could trade for them,*
Actually, there were faucets that could give you large sums of BTC for free, and early adopters were just handing them out so that's unlikely; I think the earliest I saw a monetary value exchange on BTF was like late 2010 or so, maybe early 2011? Before that they essentially had no real monetary value so they were treated like 'fake internet money' and given simply away.

Pretty much this, the aceto on meat is a typical thing from Florence with a cut of beef that is similar in flavor profile and size, look up fiorentina and see what I mean--the acceto helps cleanse the palate as you will be eating that thing for a while and want to savour the dish as you go. Plus since its fermented, and still technically active in the bottle, its full of umami flavor to enhance the next bite.
Prepare to dish out the big bucks for it, too. The stuff my friend Giancarrlo's family made cost 1500euro per liter and won a ton of awards, and despite what anyone says to the contrary: the best aceto made in ER was made in Maranello, not Modena!
I'm a die-hard Emilia Romangna guy, too, but that Parma labeling stuff is really just a government cartel, tons of stuff from different regions enters the Market through black market farmer's markets for those in the know for far less money than the designated stuff. Often with better results as the farmer/artisan himself will be there to explain and be able to talk quality control and supply constraints, which is more important than geographic location as most of these places in ER are typically 5-10 miles away from one another.
I ran a kitchen in Maranello  and was privileged enough to meet the World's biggest Tifosi, I hung out at his house with all his vats (going back to the 19th century) and his aceto holds up to anything I tasted while in Modena from other artisans!
Anything labeled balsamico that is runny enough to need a reduction doesn't belong on meat, use that to dress your greens with olive oil.
Food snob mode on: Aceto on ice cream is good, but you shouldn't be eating strawberries if they need aceto, I never understood eating stuff like that out of season. I was once asked to make insalata caprese in the middle of Jan, so, after tinkering with a combination of vinegar and lemon to get things to some close to what you'd get in taste in late spring early summer ready for service for 100 I swore I'd never do something like that again. Enjoy fruit as Nature provided it, you can never out do that.

Other than the self-serving narrative that things must be fiercely pursuing an inclusion of all genders to be accepted/mainstream narrative (I personally don't care for this, I selected a female co-founder despite her gender solely because of her merits for my startup) what does this achieve? I mean seriously, I think its patronizing at best, and 'positively' prejudice at worst to make these claims. 
I also helped a group, who was led by a female developer, win at a hacka-thon by introducing THEIR project and setup a pitch to the guys that were paying a nice crypto payout, solely  because it was a good idea, not because the team's leader didn't have a Y chromosome. Unblike the students who got crappy stuff like chromesticks and the like, they got 20k in an Alt-currency that if they listened converted at least 50% into BTC and have a nice windfall from a proof of concept. 
I'm of the opinion that we reached a saturation point sometime in 2016 amongst the 'technorati' and we would be best served in understanding this and reaching out toward the masses, regardless of colour, sex, race etc... if we are to achieve a new benchmark in terms of adoption. Nonsense like this is what the MSM resorts to get eyeballs and heads to nod in absentminded agreement when they have no substance to their subject matter; we're better than that. At least, I thought we were;  when I used to hold workshops on Bitcoin 101 it was clear that a it was mainly female-centric in my region, mainly older women trying to grasp the concept and considering diversifying their holdings, did that alone make me re-arrange my POV or slides to fit that profile? No.
That would be condescending considering the fact that a Female runs LN development (starkbot), and Bit-Pesa was founded by a Women (Elizabeth Rossiello) as well. We should keep this quote in mind when trying to grasp the complexity of Einstein's relativity in the 20th Century, before succumbing to the brain-dead trap of gender vetting:

That town/municipality has sought for that area to be an eco-driven economy, one which was making sweetheart deals left and right for anyone willing to venture that far out to make it happen a few years ago. $1.2 million for anything in California is a bargain in today's over inflated Real-estate/Housing Market, let alone for an actual Town, so they did well o initial capital outlay.

For those not paying attention, it seems clear now in hindsight that 2014's Maidan revolution and the role Bitcoin played was a total success. It did what I have always thought really successful revolutions do, convey an ideology and create its substance as it goes withing a local context--learning from the past events and making projections for what could be in the future. 
Its hard to believe that it was literately impossible to see this very image 5 years ago on the streets of Kiev which were ablaze with displays of violence; the Revolution had caused a shortage of currency and the hyperinflation that followed devastated the nation. 
The subsequent violence that took place between Russia and the West, while unfortunate and sad was perhaps the necessary stimulus to make something like this occur, it looks so insipid but Ukraine became one of the most Bitcoin friendly nations on Earth since then. Not because guns were and blood were drawn for it, but because they as a People found utility and adoption was gained organically due to need. 
Sidenote: Most don't realize that Ukraine, specifically the Crimea region is actually a breadbasket of Europe; it has a dark past, given the gulags but it has some of the most amazing top soil in all of Continental Europe. Which is odd given Chernobyl's impact, some parts of Germany never really recovered due to the fallout for example.

Also, Cash is not an exchange, think of it more like a add-on service to Square, which much like paypal/Venmo et al, incurs fees.

Also, where is this cafe so I can send some btc to my friends in Zagreb to buy something (is it that 'house of cake' place with all the mirrors near the city center?). I spent a lot of time in Zagreb and at the time their was only talk about an ATM sometime in the future, its cool to see merchant adoption taking place in what I always thought would be a cash-based country. 
Though if I'm honest, 30 hours seems excessive; if you're good a 2-3 hour consultation for q/a regarding the mechanics, process and legal implications (none in HR if I remember correctly) and the rest is implementation, set up and diagnostics on your machinery. Which should be wrapped up in no more than 10-15 hours or so. 
I personally just walk people through the ATM purchases (although I'm not a fan of ATMs!) and getting situated with crypto is reward enough, and I get invited to a bunch parties and events for free; but if this is a CV building affair, then yeah, charge what you think is fair and most will respond positively if you do it correctly.

'They' (Coinme) are a separate company in WA piggy-backing off the infrastructure Coinstar have in most stores in the US in order to gain traction; the machines themselves are irrelevant, the same thing was seen in Switzerland with them using SBB kiosks because how widely accessible they are. 
I've spoken with the company itself, and as an experienced user I think its a good primer for noobs to dip their toes in with, the Team itself is seeing a lot of traction from an older demographic buying smaller sums. For what, I don't really know but my guess is that its just to play around with.  They also have a lot of odd things they do for 'customer protection' that I didn't like but I can understand why they have it in place for who they are targeting. 
Having been used to p2p private txs for my purchases I can't say I'd use it myself, but for recommending it to others who don't have the inclination to protect their privacy, I'd say its one of several options that is easier than others and the fee is decent unlike a lot of BTMs.

I agree with both sentiments, but you can easily replace the word  f\*\*\*y, with Cyberpunk. Because that is exactly what this thing is out of, the event , in fact Musk himself is a damn near personification of your stumbling Hero figure out of those same dystopic cyberpunk novels.
Grimes, his girlfriend who is/was a pretty hardcore anarchist, is really influencing him too; her dystopic Bladerunner intro, the 'we appreciate power' music video... my first reaction to all of it was 'no, not yet...' but now I realize that you have to be that brazen, we did 10 years ago in many ways so maybe it really is a matter of 'no time like the present.'

Yeah, and this is what leads to massive confiscation of funds in that Industry, which then leads to a sort of bank account whack-a-mole in desperation of keeping the thing afloat. I've seen it too many times. 
If I remember correctly, she accepted LN payments, too. But as is often the case, the legacy system far outweighs the crypto side in use. 
There are complaint systems in place in CA, which have actually done an amazing job at keeping pace with the legislation to keep bank accounts alive. I don't know of another state that can actually say the same. But CO is just egregious and the small(ish) MJ industry suffers.  


This is what I think is soft consolidation, it will eventually fall into financial distress and one of the big players will either buy it up if its deemed to be profitable location, or simply board it up for pennies to remove competition in the Market. 
CO has been the M$ of the MJ/hemp Industry for sometime now, I don't expect that to change, if anything it will only get worse until you have a defacto cartel/monopoly as its just a war of attrition now.

Do you remember how many 'I lost my bitcoin stories' pop up around here throughout the years using malware infested phones and web-wallets on computers? 
Chances are these are not the most tech savvy people with a great understanding of OpSec, some may be sharing PCs with family or children who likely dl anything and everything on Windows box. 
At least paper wallets serves as good primer, that if needed, can be used to sell when available and the private key is only known to the creator. I suggest paper wallets because it appeals to the human condition that something isn't real, much less of value, if not tangible--I've tried for too long to combat this, but have since acquiesced.

Top up option, they require a CC for initial setup, unfortunately, if you want a non-free account; once registered you top up your account after confirming your new package. They will show you a qr code and will auto-refresh, after a block confirmation it usually prompts you that you have paid. 
I must warn you: I only used their service because they were the first mobile service to accept BTC in the US, they have only 3g (I have spotty/inaccessible 4g reception in even the most biggest cities) on a 4g Nexus and the Sprint network isn't the most easy to locate in the 'sticks.'

Also worth noting: Wikileaks are earlier adopters and recipients of BTC, Satoshi himself was opposed to the community getting involved given their notoriety; we said 'fuck that,' and did it anyway.

It remains the coolest thing I've ever done with Bitcoin to date, and I've done some pretty fucking rad stuff with this tech throughout the years.
If you're really inclined to see it as it unfolded (most of it was taken to PM) follow my post History to that time, and you'll see how the grassroots aspect help overcome the immediate need for protestor's needs during the Maidan: they made make-shift hospitals, bought shoes, and a soup kitchen with power generation spots.
The Maidan was a success if only because it the made Ukrainian people aware that the powers that be will remain regardless of name or faces, and as such alternatives, like BTC, needed to be explored. The plutocrats bought in, and made legislation favourable for thier positions, but the People too have adopted this as an option, as seen here. It was paid and had a large cost(s), that much is sure, but if there are Bitcoin friendly places in the World I'd prefer live in, Ukraine is the only one I'm really considering, and I live in a 'tech city' in the US that has Crypto presence/awareness to an extent.


Honestly, this makes me want to pack up and leave right now. The education aspect is the biggest hurdle, so many great projects have failed because they came too early to Market to a distrustful or all together uniformed clientele--I pretty much had to pivot to Education by 70% where my fintech solution was about 30% of what we were doing by the time we were done.
It is my belief that the better educated the populace are of the technology the more likely the project has to succeed at making itself viable.

If Edward wasn't known for being the most hated and hunted man on Earth for what he did exposing the NSA's hacks and the Cables of the 5 eyes etc... this alone solidifies his place in History in my book.

I started his book when it came out but Life got in the way as I got into the first 5 chapters and my reading list also doubled in that time, but one thing that struck out to me is a common theme in all of the coolest people I've met in crypto/tech: We all fell in love with the Internet for the potential it had in not just connecting us over it as medium, but to unite Humanity and rally it to elevate the Human Condition itself in a way never possible. 
It's remarkable how recurring that same story keeps coming up the closer I look, and for some it happened earlier in Life than others (we're both the same age so it moved me).

What was the price rise in 2017 fueled by if not (young) ignorant people believing many millennial aged 'influencer' youtube stars, filling their heads that they'd get rich quick? We don't need that fiasco again, especially as Segwit/Bcash drama has run its course and Layer 2 is coming along nicely during this price dip.
Honestly, you make this sound like its some sort of pyramid scheme with posts like these. If those 'youth' were smart they would have looked into the tech and bought the dip and held on to it because of its fundamental use cases that have developed just in that time they bought at ATH.
They can already buy if they're under 18, if they use as it was meant to be used in a p2p manner--hell I saw a 17 year old incoming college kid buy like $5 Ethereum before the semester started a few years ago. Or go on BISQ or Myclium trader if you need alt to that.
I'm convinced Bitcoin's critical mass moment will only occur when the young and old alike won't even know they're using Bitcoin at all, until then you're expecting everyone who can drive a car to be a mechanical engineer capable of discerning what every part in a car is for: in which case you will die trying to do what is impossible.
Focus on the tech, and do your part to increase use cases while making it so easy and approachable that they think its just as easy as sending a text/email with some online banking user interface to get them on-board if you want to do something actually productive; after being in this for nearly 9 years now, everything else just looks scammy as hell to me.

Pretty much a standard roadster style since the 40s, really; very avant-garde tones especially the silver finish, mixed with techy futuristic stuff like meshed carbon fiber skin, the tail light contracting/expanding like a muscle was an odd but fascinating touch.
The whole thing is an 'ode to love,' as it were...  that's straight from the designer.

This is why I don't get why non-anarchists are involved in BTC at all, I get the greed aspect, but if you really see how this all works you will come to realize what the real goal of this tech is: a Global Society unfettered by the absurdity imposed by the State. One that will allow us to experiment freely with how Societies and Communities are structured; much how the Internet itself was supposed to allow, and sort of did for a short window. 
Bitcoin itself doesn't just solve any problem, its a tool, a means to an end; a network and a unit represented by a series of elegantly made code form a Global community of developers that operates on the network on the Internet, nothing more. Asking if we have the right to transfer something like this freely is like asking if we have the right to exchange ideas or thoughts: its self evident that we do. as Humanity is based on the premises of exchange.
Simply buying alone was never enough, to be truly engaged in this movementand community you need to be an activist about this and create use-cases to serve and fit this model, after having been through the trails and tribulations these past years I can now firmly see a bright, albeit difficult future, it was worth pursuing given how much progress we've made.

Seriously this. But I fear BTC won't do much if he's subject to a kangaroo court process and trial.
He's an OG cypherpunk and his work prior to Wikileaks is just as important as it was after, this guy is at the core of why Cypherpunk/Cryptoanarchy is so important, Free Journalism and the means to distribute it is now capable of prosecuting a foreign citizen (Australian and Ecuadorean national) in a violation of UN/International Law and Ecuadorean Constitutional Law.

Ok, Homework time for a numbers guy: if BTC's market cap is X after this recent surge what is LN capacity in terms of percentage to that?

MASSIVE legal liability, also these guys are dealing with law changes on a monthly (sometimes weekly basis) that could cripple them in legal fees and possible shutdowns for things outside of payments; especially in CO given the precedence they set last year. I was averse to Rec legalization in CA as it actually had a really good model, one that despite my startup being BTC centric (for the Hemp industry) made me realize that its not a one-size fits all situation and could function as is with careful legla framework protections for merchants and fintech startups. 
CA has the most business friendly approach that I've seen so far in that respect and framed their laws around ensuring the small mom-pop farm/franchise can continue to thrive, unlike CO/WA/OR where it was an obscene money grab and war of attrition of who has the deepest pockets. Now, delivery stuff is another matter, which apparently is a cluster fuck, but that's last-step logistics not finance or growing so outside my domain. 
CO is really one of the harshest to deal with in the US, too many lobbying interests and big money fuck up this Industry more than it already is--hence why four corners CU went nowhere despite dropping 250k into that project (Federal Reserve charter not issued, and taken all the way to the Supreme Court) went the way it did.
I could go on, but the MJ Industry wanted our help the most and I got pitched and interviewed at several of those startups, but their are way too many complications to even try and make a work-around happen.
I'm curious to see how long they'll be able to operate before they get hit with some sort of infraction from the CO department of revenue or IRS or some other entity as this cannot go on for too long before it raising some serious red flags. Even though this is the most transparent why to monitor incoming funds/purchases in real time!

Same thing happened to me, oddly enough (not really) it was a large pharmaceutical company that bought it out. Luckily I have been self-medicating and eating well since I left University at all costs in order to avoid going to a hospital ever again. 
I was just at an ER this month for a relative, who has really good coverage, and the obscene amount of time you have to wait for patient care is abhorrent, so much so that I fear what happens to those in dire need of it. I once saw someone in urgent care bleeding unconscious (she looked as if she was in car wreck) on a bed in hallway while the nurses and doctors were scrambling about the entire floor with other patients, it scared me for life. 
It was then that I realized that this industry (of which I was forcefully aligned to due to mergers-acquisitions) will sooner destroy itself before it corrects itself, and the article affirms my position.

Did she put that pay in BTC volatility thing she talked about in that interview yet? That is a cool idea, and huge vote for BTC if she did move forward with it. As a concept I can see how it would work when there aren't many people purchasing in BTC, but if given enough time people could just undercut her with CBD products or something.
But she sounds like one of us, so I'm glad she is open to this. Accepting btc for cannabis products make sense, on paper/theory, but its a huge pita to deal with the dept of revnue as is. But since she's keeping the bitcoin then that eliminates the biggest hurdle: Fiat.

He can't do that unless Blue Origin actually achieves re-useable rockets, which they are miles behind on: New Glenn won't be flying until 2021 at the earliest according to their own projections, who knows when it actually does fly succesfully.
The idea isn't Bezo's, it was really thought up by many most without the knowledge or resources to do it, and only properly executed by SpaceX with Tin-tin 1/2 and they are scheduled to send Starlink in May.
Bezos is a fucking media-whore, who should have spent all that Amazon money into his aerospace company to kill ULA already rather than portray himself as some sort of bald-aging but rich tech-billionaire playboy.
His other companies are horrible places to work for, and yet... I still want Blue Origin to succeed. No sure how, given how slow they've been, given they were founded in 2000, 2 years before SpaceX--and just look at how much SpaceX has done in 1 year as opposed to the entirety of Blue Origin's 18 year history.


Internet connectivity really should be more ubiquitous ALL OVER THE WORLD, and is a testament of why things like Skycoin actually matter--incentivizing meshnet and ISP-less networks. There have been to many examples of crazy despots trying to shutdown the internet during revolutions/uprisings since 2008 to not take this seriously.  Projects like CJDNS and meshnets and Internet freedom should be a core part of the crypto ideology, and is often an indicator of why you got into this in the first place.
If you think about it, the MegaCorp ownership, with an alliance with the State, has been a thing since its inception on the Internet as we know; this needed to be disrupted at least 15 years ago, so I'll take my chances with SpaceX and to a lesser extent BlueOrigin rather than verizon or comcast, or even Facebook et al who have benefactors of crony-capitalist relationships with the State.

So, Fiberoptics are obsolete? I recently saw a local article detailing how Verizon has been stonewalled for a potential tower site, when in reality no one (private individuals) has Fiber optic connectivity in this town, despite it having been laid out and years ago.
Personally, this is why i think SpaceX's constellation, tied with meshnets to build an ISP-less Internet 2.0, is far more important than stuff like this: a local municipality could easily circumvent the roll out of this technology, and while I'd prefer higher speeds some times, I care about connectivity itself more than speed. The internet is pretty damn fast even on Cable for most usecases. Zeronet and things like Skycoin are worthy participants in this fight, as is Guifi.

It's one thing to file a patent, one that is only feasible if his aerospace corp can actually deliver on its promises, which to date has been all talk from Bezos as Blue Origin is pure vaporware thus far. I'm a bigger fan of Blue Origin than ULA, so I want them to ultimately succeed. and kill that pork spending cancerous blob. But, so far Bezos is all talk, and too busy tweeting about splitting his Amazon money in his divorce and dating has-been weather chicks from LA morning shows (I knew I recognized her face from somewhere!) to actually focus on aerospace.
SpaceX however can and has been delivering microsats for some time on their own rockets for customers, and has simulated the STARLINK program, which is essentially what Amazon is copying.  June 2019 is the projected time line for its first sat launch, which I think will likely be onboard a customer payload to offset expenses. Also, SpaceX already has FCC approval for said project., not just some patent
This may usher in the much needed reboot of the Internet, one driven away from the panopticon ISP hell we know it as, into a meshnet enabled system with decentralization being at its core once again. It's still not clear how it will all pan out, but this is way better than relying on the ever consolidation of ISP in the World, which can be shut down (temporarily) if some head of state decrees it.
Edit: [1st Starlink launch will be in May, bitches!](


Hard to say for sure how it will all play out, I think there will be hanger-ons that will keep it afloat for some time, as there are with fiat based banking and hedgefunds despite the advent of crypto.
But, given how most telecoms/ISPs invested in cell towers for broadband use, rather than expensive cables, in Africa they didn't have the same sunk costs as a Western based TC/ISP. Plus a lot of development in Africa came from Chinese soft imperialism, so they may have deeper pockets and the may request the needed budget to roll out 5G. And from what little I have come to understand about 5G, that will essentially make even Fiberoptics obsolete in speed and coverage, thus the price point is much lower for them to stay competitive.

It's really weird how these last 15 years have played out, I remember how wifi wasn't even a thing at most universities or cafes, the most you could find were wired in LAN lines at the most advanced/expensive places and they were limited; wifi connectivity was almost a thing limited to residential use, and its evolved into this... so amazing.

If this study's conclusions are to be believed, it seems to have naturally solved itself--as one would expect in a system that is incentivized to do so. Vertical integration, of goods/services that utilize the excess heat generated from the miners, is the next challenge that we should focus on.
This, too, is well within our capabilities and makes me excited to see what will emerge in the near future! My personal favorite is the [Canadian greenhouse/fish farm](

Yeah, its like a Vietnamese version of the UK's Hustle or remake of Ocean's 11; it goes on rather long as its a 'revenge' story so it needs to be setup, but it was worth it. I saw it when it had no subs and had to break it up into 3 parts, but I'm guessing sine its now on Netflix that shouldn't be an issue.

Worth noting that this argument is rather disingenuous even from that perspective; the USD relies chiefly on the US DoD to maintain its hegemony as reserve currency of the World, who happens to be the World's largest polluter, and biggest user of fossil fuel(s):
This should be seen as the primary root of the issue, while the parasitic banking and credit card companies with all their infrastructure (both digital as well as the brick and mortar establishments) must be seen as an adjunct; this means the energy use of every component including every building, staff, servers etc to service said system when making a valid juxtaposition: that is when a clearer picture emerges. (Not to mention the costs of all the central point of failures, bailouts, security breaches etc... that have unquantifiable externalities.)
I'm an environmentalist, and I highly advocate for the greater crypto community to begin to transition more to renewable sources of energy while finding viable uses for the excess heat they generate--and ideally create viable business models to support itself. 
But even when taking all this into consideration, and as daunting as it may seem at first given the ever fluctuating profit margins, this is actually a concern that WE CAN actually address, while the aforementioned fiat system has only its demise (and a great deal of unnecessary Human and environmental misery) built into it before it ever corrects itself. 
The truth is that as 'wasteful' as it may appear on paper to its detractors, this is what the True Market cost of running the Most secure Network known to Man costs at this time. We can and should fix this, and now with Jihan/Bitmain's Monopoly breaking down it can spur on a more distributed landscape in which we see this take place as larger institutions are joining the fray.

The price is not a reflection of its current utility, the things you mentioned are welcomed, for sure, but when will they be able to be used to deliver on their promises of all of the lofty goals they set out to do: smart property or devices?
Will they get there, someday, maybe... but I think we're still a long way off and while I'd like to see it happen: we're simply not there yet. And from what I have gathered from several ETH meetups is that the recent price rise is not based on actual fundamental improvements to the protocol, merely the increased demand of gas for tx from the ICO trading mania.

I've been to the factory and interviewed, I'm still on NDA actually, so I cannot say much; but almost all the people I met are equally as passionate as he is about what they're doing; Tesla pay isn't great and you're not there to look for a cushy job, you won't last: you're there because you want to be a part of something great.  
Turn over is significant, and there are many jaded considering the layoffs etc... which they may have good reason to considering their stance(s) on Unions.

I think all political classes function the same, regardless of Nation (self imposed fictions), and plundering the populace  under great economic distress is the MO; how is what he is saying not True?
I mean just look at this video: 
They purposely omit that the Maduro government was confiscating supplies (food as well as medical) coming in from outside of Venezuela and reaching those same physicians/students, thus exacerbating the very same misery they blame the US for. They were stealing miners from people who tried to mine BTC to have something to trade for basic essentials when the State was still mulling this economic *savant* solution and removing the 100 Bolivar (most common note) from circulating, thus creating a very clear 'Us and Them' divide. 
Personally, I don't think this will be the silver bullet they think it will be and hope that the living standards improve for Venezuela after this recent horrible period; but what this will also show is what happens when a Nation State level actor employs crypto-anarchic tools to over come a very serious threat (economic sanctions) on the Global stage.

Jesus, dude, trolls or out in full effect in this place its so disheartening... I didn't even think Buttcoin was still a thing. Cancer is resilient if nothing else.
I started with an immense and lofty idea of what this tech could do, too, and at the time it was even regarded as 'too crazy' within this community (BTC Talk, mainly) but now what I sought to do is being done by the Monoliths of Tech in 7 years time! And I have those years of experience to tap into.
I'd say use the experience from all those jobs and figure out what problems they all had in common, many do irrespective of Industry, and try to see if it could benefit from this tech. It likely won't, or it will but you'll have to build it from the ground up most likely with many failures along the way, but it will likely allow you to iterate into something that could have a use-case and if you're lucky a business model. 
If it doesn't pan out, as most startups do fail, you worked on something that drives you and you developed as a Person because of it with a greater skillset had you remained idle.

The price may not be indicative of where we are progress wise, but 2018 is shaping out rather nicely ecosystem wise with this news; as well as LN support coming on strong lately and with Wasabi and Samourai building privacy based solutions.

Why?  
I had never heard of open source software until I saw all those Linux distros for the first time and then did a quick skim of their respective (and often divisive) communities on forums and irc. It didn't make sense to me why anyone would bother re-inventing the wheel--having been in the usenet days, I just jumped all over the place with no real allegiance to any newsgroup because I just wanted to learn--until I saw that the communities were why these guys would forgo working on other projects; I didn't and couldn't contribute to those at the time, but I thought it was a cool concept none the less. 
And then when BTC came on my radar on 2010/2011 I knew what I was looking at and got involved. 
QT/Core was really daunting, I was still on XP, and outside of BTF there was no where to go for info, at all. So I learned to use Linux distros, how to setup and synch nodes and with the right motivation and many, many failures, I realized and learned to navigate it. Such that I taught my mom how to use pgp over text messages (out of necessity) having learned from a bottom-up approach with only the basics on hand.

I get called a 'Bitcoin maximalist' for pointing out the obvious things you outlined, but the truth is back in 2014 I want things like Ehereum to succeed, but the longer it goes on the more I see just how compromised ETH is at its core as are most of these alts/ICOs. To be fair, I never really gave them much attention as BTC moves so fast (btw thanks for that, Greg!) that I couldn't even if I wanted to.
The real issue is that they see short-term gains as the chief motivator for why something 'just works' without looking at the projects inherit flaws. I don't feel guilty letting them continue anymore, but for those who express interest in BTC I tend to go over why the best hast yet to come (LN/Schnoor Sigs/Atomic Swaps/Coinjoin iterations etc...). 
I like the mission statements of things like Skycoin, but its funny to me how they branded it as 'the better Bitcoin,' so I just tune that part out as they have solid plan to create and incentivise a new way to build a widely deployed meshnet--although I had hope that 21co had done this instead.

After his ousting as CEO at Paypal I read that he has set up all his companies in such a way that he cannot be ousted, furthermore, only Tesla is a publicly traded company; and even something he wished he could have avoided. He isn't even paid for being CEO of Tesla until he fulfills his goals of the latest Master Plan. 
I don't think he doesn't care about profits at all, so much as its him willing to go for a moonshot (Master Plan) and make the compromises necessary to post-pone them if need-be; Tesla just recorded its worst quarter this month and still traded at above 335, and is still likely to meet revised Model 3 production expectations.

Ok, lets take this to PM; this time cite not just the white paper of why you think that was the intention (it actually says p2p currency in the title, not micro-payments, but ok whatever), but also include how the overall network has morphed since Satoshi published that in its iterations since then; I think its something like 50-70% of Satoshi's code is now moot at this point in Core.
BTW, and this is only because I had to re-check my own facts as well, not once is micro-payments mentioned in the White Paper; small casual tx are, which is analogous, but as I said, do the legwork and I'll engage. 
Also, and this is for my own benefit, include the message in the genesis block in your PM title.

I think the fact he, as a comedian, can follow a Hancock or Carlson, is rather remarkable. Those guys are powerhouses of information on geology and anthropology/Egyptology and the fact he doesn't resort to some absurd tangent and allows them talk on what they know best is rather cool. (I think Hancock and JRE are actually closet anarchists, they'll never admit it but their discourse when they're together dances around it.)

Is this confirmed? I thought the mystery AA donor was female, while Pineapple never delved into that.
Either way, I asked them (who ever they are) to donate back then:
Alexandra has been doing an amazing job, despite the takedowns its been an exceptional tool for those like myself who need access to it post-University studies. But much like the Net Neutrality issue, what we're really dealing with is more fundamental how the Internet as we know it is broken--the advancement of information and access to all who seek it is integral to the concept of what the 'information superhighway' was supposed to be, but has long since been lost as Telecom/Tech and State collusion got stronger over the years--due to centralization and monopolization of service areas through overt cronyism in the US.  
I think reshaping the narrative to 'how do we fix the Internet' is a much better use of our collective resources than prolonging the inevitable. I've been out of the Meshnet community for years, but things like Zeronet and Skycoin have been making inroads to that end. Perhaps Pineapple's funding would be better used there?

I'd wait a little longer until some of the kinks are ironed out for sums you're not too upset about losing, because the truth of the matter is I was playing around with Segwit stuff last night, and if the reason you want to run a LN node/channel is because you're concerned about tx fees and time delays, don't.
I paid less than 15 cents from a non-Segwit to Segwit addess tx, and got in the next block; paid less than 5 cents for Segwit-Segwit and got in the next block each time. 
You're really are better of waiting right now and just continue working on Mainnet.

Honestly, I want to set the record straight on the this topic more than you will ever comprehend, but after all these years talking about it from Biologist's perspective I've realized it likely won't happen; but since you seem so driven to discredit what you probably don't understand yourself, I feel compelled to have to speak out if only to deter one other person of fomenting their unsubstantiated criticism: 
See that, this is exactly what we're (bio)mimicking with BTC, you have a distributed and uncensorable network with which to exchange and transport certain value-added mediums of value. Every interaction between this network functions like a member of an overall ecosystem, working symbolically (with other species') to achieve consensus (equilibrium) for the viability of the overall network or community. 
Its semantics in way, but honestly your attitude of belittling something you can't fathom in this space has become suffocating. And all too common.
Here you have someone advocating that in the begging (almost) everyone initially came to this space to Build something in order to create value to the network, and someone comes up with a novel use-case (to them), and all you can dwell on is that?
Many forget Crypto-anarchism and Bio-hacking have the same origins, and the same idealogical ends; to me this network always appeared like the emergence of the two, and I'm reminded more and more why that is. 
Just walk away with this: One of the first, and in my opinion still the best of the rest for various reasons, Mobile wallets was called Mycelium. Think on that as you glibly skim that link I provided you. But just watch the YT video in it.

You have a very skewed perception of how these entities operate, its as though they are innocent bystanders and victims to Tax Laws, when in reality they lobby congress to ensure that they don't pay or pay as little as possible. And when they can't get what they wanted, they offshore it, and then get implicated in these schemes. All while selling your privacy to intelligence agencies who they are almost always directly linked in crony capitalist fashion.
I agree that individuals should be able to pay the least amount possible, what isn't realistic is to assume every citizen can afford to play by these tactics and succeed. 
Personally speaking, I don't use any of those services--most of us who believe in Cypherpunk philosophy warned people about what they were and how they would establish a business model, and to our wide spread detriment we were right and they created Megacorps in process when they didn't listen.
Despite that, I detest that my tax liability is as high as it is, when I do not and have not made it a habit to use anything that is publicly funded. Most of my Education was in Private school, my roads were paid by a consumption tax or funded privately (toll roads), I wasn't eligible to get grants in University so I worked and borrowed money from close family/friends etc... Which in bitter irony, I subsequently was forced to subsidize for others s well as endless inflation and war.
In an ideal situation, which is what you're operating under, I would be able to choose the programs and the amount I would be willing part with from my wages. I do not get this option, and thus have no representation from the process as I didn't elect any of these people nor do I recognize their presumed authority over me. I only know that they have jails, guns and cages and endless amounts of resources to ensure my fate is sealed in the aforementioned should I not comply.

Right, which is not held by the hacker community in my experience, which is why I delved into that point I made, and referenced that thread at YC. 
We do ourselves a disservice by trying to cater to the lowest common denominator by attracting those sort, I know this sounds super elitist, because if we're at the point of trying to deploy schnorr signatures and things like mimble wimble etc... 
My main point is this: I still think its pretty lame to charge for this info, though, adding a value added service is one thing, but simply profiteering for access is anti FOSS/Hacking philosophy.

Not sure what you're alluding to.
Ninja edit/post removal I replied to (this is my last effort here):
No, the farce reached an unbearable level after 2015 for anyone paying attention; the misdeeds of this trial were Educational to anyone working in this space, which has been become the vast minority these days. 
Had I done so, I would have been (even more) discouraged to do what I did in this space.
The fact remains your 'hail mary' shot at getting him pardoned is untenable, I'm pretty sure that Manning is likely the last person to be pardoned for being (loosely) affiliated with the Cypherpunk movement. Maybe you don't realize it from your position as you follow this banality, and worse yet believe in it, but we've been in the 2nd Crypto War since at least 2010. 
And even then I think a lot of it had to do with the pressure that Obama's political base (being pro-queer/trans and prone to vicious SJW mobbing) then it was about his actual merits as a Human being--which in my estimation far exceed his sexual preference. 
Assange has had it FAR worse than Ross if you look at this on basic categorical evidence throughout his life as an Activist, maybe you should look at what what Assange was doing prior to Wikileaks and the Cypherpunk mailing list before you pass judgement on who is in your view 'more worthy' of some head of state's pardon.

I have no doubt that was the case; Energy has and will always likely remain a Government backed venture--until we reach a post-nation state Global Society--,which lends itself to crony-ism by design. The costs are too immense, the land and property procurement issues are beyond the scope of most private corporations budgets etc... 
I see the Energy sector much like Aerospace: unfortunately, accommodations and compromises are necessary for longterm benefits, once the infrastructure is in place the ability to no longer have the State have a say in the matter becomes more likely. Its a hard dilemma, that earlier in Life I would be entirely reluctant to accept, but now that we're on-road to become an inter-planetary species, I'd rather adjust and make progress to that end than remain rigid and stagnate as this short-lived Window continues to diminish with time (Iceland alone lost nearly a decade of Human Capital and potential since the Icesave debacle!).

I wouldn't go that far... yet; I have always discouraged the level of notoriety and dare, I say 'worship' he's received, as this is not the Cypherpunk and Crypto-Anarchist way: we are not here to create idols or prophets. (Satoshi included!)
I'm still baffled how he went from being a developer on Unsystem projects in Catalunya to creating the biggest hype machine in Crypto (smart property were just around the corner in 2014!) with ETH. The thing is... people bought into it, myself included, for a while but now its lost on me what ETH is other than 'THE ICO' platform. Their Blockchain is full of bloat, and massive for its short existence, its use case (if it truly exists) is muddled with jargon and meandering 'what ifs' as explained before.

I'm a big Tesla fan, but they also failed to meet on their deadline, had tons of hurdles with the chassis, raised the costs of the Roadster before delivery etc... Clarkson is a clown, albeit an entertaining one, there were more reasons than that as to why investors/early adopters got cold feet. 
Also, the roadster was overheating at its premier launch, and had to be swapped as they were cooling it down with ice. Tesla's history is all the more interesting because of these setbacks, and despite being an anarcho-capitalist I can give them a pass (albeit hard to swallow) for the DOE grants because at the end of the day because their very existence has done more good than harm to disrupt the war machine and its dependence on oil.

Actually, that's not true in the case of Russia. 
In true Ant-fragile fashion, Russia realized that sanctions and trade wars were the new norm from the US/EU and overhauled their entire Ag system; they have spectacular farmers markets and locally sourced produce as a standard now instad of importing from all over EUrope, as its less costly that way for the end consumer in addition to it being tastier. It's actually quite remarkable how quickly it had to be done, but also what made the annexation of Crimea necessary; Ukraine has some of the most fertile soil in all of Europe. 
EU farmers are the ones that got really fucked on that one as that was a huge part of their market share being taken away from them.

When I was in school and told to take my grievances regarding the ever-increasing tuition bubble and the social pressures it would place on my fellow students by the Dean of Sciences to my local congressman I found out many things after a few hours of legwork: one he went to the same university as I did, studied criminal justice before entering politics, and another was that he was caught and charged with soliciting prostitutes and had drugs in his system.

I have a lot of sympathy for Vegans who were  forced into it as children by Adults; their brains never really fully developed, but grown Adults who do these kind of acts are in some delusional cult. Grain cultivation, especially non-organic, is HIGHLY irresponsible and destructive to the environment and flora/fauna of the Earth.
The first Harvest I ever participated in was for a grain farm (spelt, which was all the rage by most vegetarians at the time, its really good too) and a fox got caught in the combine and its carcass had to be removed before we could continue to the next fields before sun down as the blades were not turning correctly. 
It was my responsibility to get it out and clean it, but in doing so I saw a bunch of fur and hides from different animals along the exit shoot; apparently rabbits and gophers were no match for the combine and were passive causalities and the meals for the several types of birds to pick at as we made out way through the harvest that week.
Its not just Canada by the way, I'm a Biodynamist (I've lived in Europe and the US) which is literately the most ecological form of cultivation and even I have my breath taken away by the ignorant, self-rightous BS these idiots spew most of the time.

I genuinely think we already got the proverbial low-hanging fruit: the tech savvy from all ages.
If we're truly to succeed, then its not a matter of will they be wise enough, its more, will we in this Community have done enough to onboard them via a seamless UI/UX.
That's this projects next big hurdle, after Segwit and as LN is being built out nicely, this is the biggest problem I see on the roadmap. I can opine my generation's (millennial) overall slow-wit, sheltered nature and emotional hang ups on immediate gratification, too. But its counter-productive, and I think its better to Buidl than focus on this pan-generational BS anymore.
A few boomers were apologizing to some of us in a few meetups in the early days, as they felt culpable, I made it clear I didn't want their apology or guilt, its useless to me. And you can't turn back time. B
What is useful is telling us what and how this tech made sense to them and built off of that. 
If we are to progress, we need to onboard more than just a bunch of people who think hodl'ing and staring at charts is going to make any difference. We need developers and entrepreneurs to keep building tools and businesses along side that follow that mentality.

I think not allowing his lawyer to bring in evidence of multiple DPRs, expert testimony, and ultimately silencing any coherent defense regarding parallel construction with the server seizure in Iceland was much more egregious than what you stated above, and still nothing has been done.
As much as I sympathize for his cause and what SR actually stood for (Freedom not Drugs), the fact that he had such leaky op-sec and stayed in the US cannot be overlooked. He was made an example of by the State, simple as that, Justice, Due Process and Rights are fictions that exist on paper only in the modern US. Variety Jones at least left the US, he stayed in what is essentially a massive Brave New World based panopticon: Bay Area.
Ross isn't a martyr, he isn't even a Hero, he is sadly one of many living examples to what extent the State will go to keep the status quo of the Drug War in place.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news: Nothing will come of this, the best you can do is support his standard of living, because overturning this case will not happen, ever... And While Lynn makes a compelling argument about what is at stake, Internet Freedom, that presumes it hasn't been lost a long time ago.
Net Neutrality should of have been the final nail in that coffin, the only thing left to do is to build an alternative and hope Ross can live a rich life within and helping his fellow inmates.

Except for the simple fact that the US Marshalls auctioned them off, that is how Tim Draper got his massive position.
Ross is probably like most early adopters, they have some they stashed (and likely forgot about), except he got gang raped by the State in the process.
He will never get a pardon, and I say that with a very heavy heart as we lost a great freedom fighter and it set a horrible precedent for future ones--though at least now we know very clearly what the stakes are for this wide scale disruption and the limitless amounts of underhanded tactics the State will go to that end.
But, he should left the US considering what he did and how much he had; in fact he was in Thailand if I recall correctly, but decided to move to the Bay Area, which is a straight up dystopic panopticon in terms of privacy or security.

* As previously stated, with, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Belgium and Finland, and now, Spain, we can count six Member States of the European Union taking the stance of stating that Bitcoin transactions are VAT exempt.*
What proof exists for the aforementioned above? France has been outright hostile, Germany was subject to tax if used before a set limit of time; and the only EU country that has made this claim isn't even listed: Slovenia. 
This needs more fact checking, besides, taxing BTC in Spain (just like in most S. Euro nations) would have been untenable; *hacienda* can barely keep up with the so called black market, let alone crypto. I'd love to see some of the decrepit imbeciles who work there trying to figure out how the blockchain works let alone trying to place identity to wallets in order to assess tax liability... good luck with that. **Tocate los cojones!**  
When will people understand that *tax dodging* is not a crime but rather the outcome of a stigmatized practice forced upon by empires on to its serfs--since the dawn of Western Civilization the Ancient Greeks saw taxation as outright theft, and were aghast by it just as much as compulsory school, yet saw the highest literacy rate in perhaps all of Man's history.

Cool, but I still don't care; however, I'm open to trying to care, so without pandering to the 'moon' argument(s) can anyone breakdown what the actual benefits are to having this come online?
On-boarding people to a massively volatile currency, especially considering 2nd layer protocols like LN and privacy based tools are only now just peeking through, just seems like a recipe for if we look at the past run-ups since 2011. Legacy institutions have already in this space since at least 2012, both overtly as well as secretly.
In addition to all of that Mt. Gox still hasn't been resolved after imploding with the aid of the Japanese Government, so why do we want these people meddling in these affairs? Whereas BTC-e was attacked by the State and still able to get back up and running and offer refunds (partially?) without the need of regulation and redtape sending their costs astronomically to do so.

I'm well aware of what it is, I'm saying that despite THIS being one I actually have a love-hate relationship with the M5. Everything else on their line-up is not worth discussing, even the i8 was horrid inside as far as EV goes. The i3 is so cheaply made, its panels flex so badly that I don' think it will hold up well in 5 years.
Actually, I quit to go do motorsports stuff at Nissan, but yeah... keep your troll act up.
\&gt;Please do tell
I worked in Supply Chain/Parts and Logistics; I spearheaded the Takata recall after having been at VW, and that was a nightmare. Then I did the Warranty backlog, that was even worse. Then the Combox recall, which somehow was even worse than all of that! By the time I got to the X5 driveshaft shitstorm I had already reached the conclusion that BMW makes its money not on the sale of the car itself (they may even lose money), but on maintenance, parts and repair of every vehicle instead.
The cheapest work order I ever saw reach my desk was $400, and that was for a single i3 rear tire.
By the time I was tossing cart loads of driveshafts away on a daily basis I wanted out and went back to VW and dealt with the Tdi buy back program, which is was what pretty much made me give up on anything from Germany. So I went to Nissan soon after that, and even that couldn't keep me in the Industry.
There is so much fuckery in the Auto industry, that despite being a petrolhead since I was a kid I want EV to just take over already. I'd gladly switch all my cars/motorcycles to Ethanol and crowd source a local distillery to make fuel from compost rather than deal with what's going on behind the scenes.
The current fine and costs for VW  in the US alone, at the time I was working there, was half the Market Cap of Tesla. (stock price @ sub 300, I think?) And its still not over.

 &gt; arbitrary amount of financial history.
Dude, Goldman has been behind every single fucking bubble in the Stock Market for the past 60 years, and they have installed technocrats to rape and pillage entire nations in Europe causing ungodly amounts of Human suffering in the process. You are defining *arbitrary* and undesirables in a very broad and absurd manner. 
And this isn't about my personal views, or ordaining it with my acceptance but rather what this entire philosophy stands for. 
The opposition towards these entities is far from arbitrary, and quite frankly why Bitcoin came into existence: hence Satoshi-who I will remind you was on Cypherpunk mailing lists and how he met Hal--doing what he did with the genesis block.
Listen to this very carefully, Crypto currency is the brain child of Crypto-Anarchist's and Cypherpunks' long struggles, the way the aforementioned all operate is the very antithesis of it. 
I will leave you with quotes from Tim May's Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto (1992) and Eric Hugh's Cypher-punk manifesto (1993) to remind you what the purpose of all this was:
**“Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, …with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.”**
*Tim May*
**“Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems… Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age… We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy…We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.”**

This is why ultimately I don't think the financial censorship will go away despite what legislation is passed; as you said, in Canada where it's legal at the Federal Level, you're saying banks still refuse to provide financial services to the Industry?
I'm not surprised, unfortunately, its just disappointing because it provides empirical evidence for how non-credible the 'legislative route' really is even in the rare occurrence when the citizen 'succeeds' in the Democratic Process.
In the US, I'd say its more insidious, in that its illegal at the Federal Level, but legal at the State level, and only vetted dispensaries can get banking, which ultimately makes it a very slanted process that isn't conducive with Free Markets.

As much pride as I take in Bitcoin's remarkable progress in these \~10 years, we still need to make having a new decentralized Internet a priority. Obviously we are hindered by the costs of Infrastructure, but with the advent of Spacex's Constellation we may be able to bypass that entirely.

You clearly do not understand the underlying/intended use of a State backed fiat currency throughout Human History if that is your position then, its weaponization is a built-in mechanism, and quality: especially if its holds a World Reserve Currency status and is backed by the largest Military force the World has ever seen. Fiat is more like malware, then it is FOSS; its terms of service are that you are in abject servitude to it and how it maintains itself.
Their is a reason why its called the Petro Dollar. And why in times of turmoil it will function as a stop-gap between the collapsing nations currency and the USD. As much as I hate the mechanisms by which it functions (exploitation, Human misery, inflation) I have to give it to them: the USD has shown tons of resilience, if nothing else, in ensuring its own existence when a political faction fails and is left in a sociopolitical vacuum. Its like an incredibly virulent system, it infects and takes over an economy so effectively at times that one cannot help to admire its ability to do so. 
For further reading, check out Confessions of an Economic Hitman, that really helped in seeing how that all plays out; things like Afghanistan and Iraq etc... made more sense when you see the playbook that was used in Latin/South America in the 50's post WWII by the CIA.

1. So what, if I recall correctly Kanye has done the same (not to mentione his run in with Coineye) and no one really paid attention to that either; these people will latch on to anything trending--probably given to them by some publicist with a long list of analytics in hand--in the hopes of further their presence in media attention. In a sane World no one cares what these people have to say, they don't understand the tech, let alone the implications of what this is; if asked they'd probably give some vapid remark about internet coins, thus further misinforming the public of what we've built. 
2. Symmetry is just one component of why her face and figure is off to my eye, I just think that idolization of such figures in Society underscore something more perverse in the Human psyche. 
But, yes my preference tends to side with more feminine and youthful appearances, thus I'm perplexed why a person with seemingly no talent, disfigured aesthetics and what is clearly a low intellectual disposition can garner so much attention. I've called Trump a Kardashin-reality TV show elected President, who possess the same qualities; I think in some distorted Jungian way most of the TV watching masses wish they could be either as they possess similar traits thus elevate them to stardom/rulers and live vicariously through the distorted lens that follow them 24/7 in the media. I'd like to see Charlie Brooker do an episode of Black Mirror on this phenomenon.  
But as others have said, there is something really sick about what these people have done to themselves in their pursuit of fame.
Anyhow, I have very limited exposure to either, and seek to have none at all; so I'll just withdraw from this conversation at this point as I have nothing more to add.

So, its still the moon argument but concealed in such a way as to not make it the central point, right?
Ok, I'll bite and I'll even place a level of willful ignorance to abate this concern; why do we care about this 'legitimacy'? 
Naked short selling was legal and sanctioned, as were credit default swaps, as were Mortgage backed securities, collateral debt obligations etc... all of these were instrumental in destroying the Global Economy and created one of the most, if the most as we're still living through this, plutocratic transfers of Wealth the World has ever seen. Fiat is also 'legitimate' in the eyes of the Law in most of the World and were it not for its innate obscure manner of operation, things like Bail Outs (also 'legitimate,' though HIGHLY protested against by its respective populace) aren't possible either.
Most developed nations had sane levels of inflation and cost of living even in economic downturns, these instruments not only made fiat more worthless as they all pursued the same race to the bottom but have subsequently sent the Global Debt Levels to new highs, but also has made anyone not a boomer with vast savings or a person not born into Wealth a debt peon with limited upward mobility. 
The World has been sent into the Dark Ages by 'legitimate' financial instruments before, the fact that things still operate on a daily basis (often through very robust alternative means in most of the World, eg System D) speaks to the resilience of Mankind against their respective Rulers to make ends-meet.
I'm having this discussion mainly because we're on the brink of becoming a Multi-planetary species, which if it pans out will bring about an incalculable economic boon (and consciousness) never before seen in Mankind's History, and yet we're still unable to see clearly how much of it hinges on several key factors. One being that to achieve this end, fiat has to at least function to a certain degree that companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin and companies like them remain solvent as their daily operations and costs are calculated in fiat, not crypto. Society and the supply chains they rely on are broken to their very core, and what little 'lube' their is in the system relies on fiat greasing the rusty broken gears and chains to accomplish this end.
Bridging that gap seems like not only a lucrative endeavor financially as an entrepreneur, but something that compels me beyond words to my very core.

Can I just say how remarkable it is that this word has become so ubiquitous into the English Diction from people of all walks of Life. I could never imagine this being used by Mom and Dad's to describe the inefficiency of our local food supply in a restaurant to their children even just last year!
As is the widely use of the word Fiat now by all kinds of punters on the media to describe State issued currency.
I think that Revolutions are won not when blood is shed on the street, but rather when the minds of a large segment of the population are changed and thus give birth to a new paradigm into Society. So while this is only a small drop in the sea of the collective efforts still needed to accomplish this end language is, and remains, a key indicator of what the People use to gauge a note worthy central point of failure in any system. Moreover, they are discussing what and how to overcome and compensate for this 'baked in' failure.

Ha, this reminded me of the guy I saw on my daily commute to school in a GT2, he had the worst look on his face. I was in a lowly 270hp RWD car, and absolutely hated dailying my 1/2 built loud,low turbo'd track car to school. 
I was just a moving target for police but I eventually got pulled over twice in a day, not for speeding, and I bought an 80s Honda Prelude to daily after that. Never had an issue with it either, awesome care felt like a big go-kart even after 20+ years of neglect. 
I can't imagine how that guy in the GT2 felt inside, but I don't think he was having any fun in it let alone the traffic on the 5 during am rush hour. 
Ultimately, I realized how stupid selling super/hypercars to people simply because they can afford it, as most are not just highly unqualified to use them and never stepped foot in one before buying one, but dangerous as all the power and tech gives them a false sense of confidence. 
There should be a test by the manufacture to see if you can even make actual use of 200hp on a track under controlled conditions before you're allowed to take it on the street. Just because you mash the throttle in a straight line and manage to not wrap it around a lightpole doesn't mean you're capable of actually handling it in anger, let alone if the traction breaks, or when it rains. 
With that said, EVs are the way to go for street use. ICE is a walking dinosaur, and while its fun to be on the tail end of the extinction list, the writing is very clearly on the wall when VAG is electrifying everything they can just to stay relevant in today's Market: making things like the Terzo Millennio and the MissionE (or whatever its name is now), and the E-tron is really the name of the game for the Supercar/Hyper car arms race. I'd say prior to the Terzo Millennio concept Lambo peaked with the Aventador, nothing is really on that level anymore Terzo Millennio is the next reincarnation of that spirit.

Exactly, that and the Medical Industry will sooner destroy itself, than correct at this point. You;d think sanity would have prevailed when Student Loans debt exceeded the trillion dollar level, but they just doubled down.
Which is what makes them ripe for disruption, they're just a slow moving target, and it has been taking place in the background, the aim for non-brick and mortar higher 'education' is in sight now, its probably another decade or so out, but accreditation via purely online Schooling is occurring.
I think if successful STEM will probably be the only thing left as it still requires hands on Lab work, but I'm sure someone will think of a way around that, too.
I personally regret squandering 5 years of my Life being left with 65k in debt at 23 and being thrown into the worst Job Market since the Great Depression so much that I hope no one has to endure that ever again so I gladly anticipate that to occur. I've lived near Universities almost all of my Life, and I have attended lectures since I was a Junior in HS, and its hard to imagine how this thing has gone on as long as it has. When I was a Junior in HS CSU tuition was like $2-3k/yr, Community college was like $200/semester comparable to that of most European systems. But as I went through the system it got more and more insane.
I met a kid who washed plates but came from an affluent family who paid his out of state tuition in Environmental Science, they paid $40k a year before living expenses and books/materials.
I tried to tell him taking on side-projects and maybe even launching a startup in the Summer was a better way into the Industry than a degree, as so many have that already and it won't set you apart from anyone while you're slaving away washing plates to make your Family content you're trying to offset expenses.
Funny enough, a guy I sort of mentored, got a consultant position in his first year of University as a Environmental Sciences major after having doing a few side gigs for Solar/passive energy Company in IT, an Industry where he had been a systems engineer since he left HS.
I'm over this, and I want to feel bad for all of these kids as I was indoctrinated in that system as well, but its gotten so out of hand that I cannot justify how they're ok with any of this. I knew what I had been told in HS was a farce after my incoming summer semester, but I wanted to work in a field that demands you have a BS degree, so I sucked it up only to quit after paying off my debt and swore to never return again.

The early 3.5 V6 in that Pathfinder can be provided you keep up with maintenance, I have seen VQ's with excess of 200K miles, but many suffer from neglect and [the early issues they had were often ignored by non-mechanically inclined.]( 
Nissan/Infiniti (US) put them in everything: Maxima, Altima, Pathfinder, 350Z, G35, Quest, QX, Murano etc... so it spanned quite the spectrum/consumer which may lead to the skew in outcomes. But that just means parts are plentiful if you ever need them.
But yeah, the engine is quite a beast by compression to its predecessor (VG series) , the transmission on these things is the only thing I'm not certain about, is it RWD or 4WD? 
I was going to buy one of these Pathfinders for about 2500 that had some minor body work issues. But I personally prefer a 2nd Gen Montero to just anything that was made with 4wd in the past 25 years, they are tanks, but suffer from unavoidable engine issues; so I kept mine and put the money into it instead.

[Actually, it is.]( Four Corners CU needs the Master account issued to them by the Federal Reserve to operate as a fully fledged CU; had you taken the time to know what it is, let alone to read the article and know what you are talking about, you'd know that instead of making vapid and misinformed conjecture. 
Without this they remain inoperative which leaves entrepreneurs in a perilous situation--some have had their accounts shut, funds frozen and lines of credit removed for simply being involved with the LEGAL cannabis industry. (Albeit true, I personally detest framing this matter in that dreadful light of *legality*' this is simply an injustice at the hands of these *exalted members of society*, pure and simple.) And given George's behavior they seem all together apathetic to such matters as they refused to even release any info on the matter.
Furthermore, this isn't a legislative issue, as MMJ dispensaries have been granted banking services in CO for over a decade and Congressmen have tried to pass the laws to allow them to gain access to the legacy banking system. This is a deliberate attack by the Federal Reserve to curtail an expanding +billion dollar industry (in one tiny State!) that is evidently hindered and subsequently creating a gross misallocation of resources. (That sounds familiar.)
Lastly, my point is to place focus on the myopic nature and futility to conform to legacy banking services to an emerging section of the economy; the cannabis industry in Colorado (but also in Washington) is vast and spans not just dispensaries, but also care givers and farmers in the hemp industry. They, too, are impacted. 
It is my contention that greater efforts should be made to appeal to this demographic: they are under-served and willingly/needlessly subsidizing a blackwater type economy because of it. They are the ideal use case for why Bitcoin is needed in the 'First World.' 
I understand, better than most actually, that this is easier said than done, but it is certainly worth doing. This community has to see greater value in this than pouring more funds into poorly installed rigs in Chinese mining farms or the new scam-coin plunder, right?

Shakepay is pretty good with Canadian customers; I was an early adopter and tested their NFC payments, it was less than ideal but it did work. I lost more than I'd like to admit on their exchange and on the several Visa cards I never received, as well as that digital Visa that never really worked that well. 
But, it seems they were under duress to comply with US laws at the time and ultimately decided it wasn't worth the trouble, so now they only cater to Canadian customers. I hear good things now from your fellow canucks.
With that said, $200/weekly DCA should be pretty good start, don't just buy in a single lump sum. 3k spread over several months is likely to get you a much better ROI than single purchase point(s) in my experience. Also, don't trade, you can make just as much from just saving it during a price drop than trying to time the market on leverage. Patience is key here, this is a marathon not a sprint race.
And most importantly, attend a meetup, get involved with you local community and realize why this tech matters and get excited about it, that's the biggest take away that people almost always omit: any revolution in which you cannot derive some excitement to help you enjoy Life is not one worth joining in my view.

Cynicism, in its truest sense, is actually a philosophy of virtue ethics [1], which incidentally I subscribe to: its been perverted suit a certain narrative and an agenda, often to dismiss reality in my experience for a more favorable and widely agreed upon form of deception. You're merely a victim of this perversion.
With that said, I'd say I'm overly optimistic about most things in Life, however this 'realism' comes from first hand experience, so take it how you like, but to relegate what I said to pessimism is a lazy conclusion and a poor analysis of the situation as a whole. 
Many have fallen in their attempt to subvert the State throughout Human History, and many more will in th efuture; compassion for a Human being is one thing but clinging on to an unrealistic endeavor (that never has nor would occur) rather than being honest with one's self about the situation they are in is my estimation worse than a stadium full of 'cynical' people as you have described thus far. Truth in your estimation may be Ugly in you interpretation, however, I find it deadly to not adhere to it as a guiding principal and equally frightening to not acknowledge it. 
It's like most of you don't realize that what we're really doing (disrupting the Power structure of the State) doesn't have dire, and life threatening consequences. What he did with undertaking SR and its management, while foolish in its execution in many ways, took a great deal of commitment and bravery, but make no mistake: he knew exactly what he got himself into; which was exactly what this movement needed to shift crypto into something other than merely a DNM medium of exchange, and for that we're thankful, but just like Manning before him, he knew EXACTLY what he was getting himself into. 
And judging as a mere spectator: by his actions since his sentencing, I think he has made peace with his situation. as he has been helping educate his fellow inmates. Its been his family and close friends, and the sympathizing members of the community who have remained committed to this folly that a case to overturn all of this will come to fruition of you merely exhaust any and every avenue. 
In short: this is another reason why I think Plato's Republic should be required reading to enter this community. 
I'm reminded of a quote when I think of Ross' phlight and I say this not to be calloused but a person humbled by what SR did for us as a community despite having never actually ever purchased anything on there:

While I miss the old 'squat-occupying hacker' Amir, this more fluid and articulate Amir is who is best suited to drive development than the old one; he still seems grounded in his Ideology, but understands that we're still so early that we need to develop more infrastructure and tools and ultimately that we must be willing to allow for diversity, of all sorts, into this space.
As much as I wish this was still a staunchly AnCap/CryptoAnarchist driven project, I've come to understand we are the minority now, and with that comes a certain clarity for how to best develop a useful 'ecosystem.'
I'm hoping that re-booted hacker-space thing he spoke about last year takes off, 'Darktech' if I understood him correctly, is privacy focused tools that need to be made a priority now more then ever in our History, as we see how quickly oppressive nations can quell civil protests by active monitoring and targeting via the financial systems in place, China and Hong Kong come to mind, though the US does it as well.

Whatever reason(s) you guys have to welcome these parasites on here will prove to be very short sighted if this happens, they wouldn't invest in being able to allow an ETF or to enter algo trading if they didn't have a huge position and an ability to front run and manipulate it for their own ends instead of just allowing these unregulated 'foreign exchanges' outside their control to determine the price. Free Markets are not what these People do, they want control and a position to profit from it, nothing more.

Well, if this to be believed this is the greatest evidence that we are entering into the co-op/infiltration stage of the Bitcoin adoption curve. 
They won't let us eat their lunch so they are going to start leveraging the one thing they have, cheap fiat-credit lines. 
Remember startups: Being unbanked isn't just an ideal or a maxim, its an inherit and obtainable attribute and affirmation that we have succeed. Banks will never truly go away, I'm afraid; but undermining them and reducing their Marketshare by offering better services and financial instruments is something we can quantifiably do.
PS: I'm now almost entirely unbanked, and it feels good to withdraw consent to an extortionist racket, especially knowing that these parasitic entities rely entirely on revenue incurred from fees and penalties, that and bailouts. That is their business model.

Dude, why? [In case you have forgotten their is a job fair (the 4th one) and hackathon taking place this weekend, with all kinds of startups offering positions in some pretty cool tech.]( 
This community really needs to set it priorities straight, neither mass adoption nor btc price should be the focus; innovating and creating greater use cases should be and the former will follow. I'd like the price to go sub 200, too: I'd like to have a buy in average in the 100's again. If it means breaking the bank of a few get-rich quick types to do so, all the better. 
I think we're past the suicide hotline days. So, do yourself a favor, buy some and donate some to Dark Wallet and Open Bazzar, or any the other poorly funded projects.

Interesting, but are they still confined to your Quest Diagnostics et al, or has the advent of services and startups like 23andme opened up a new arena for competing services? How are follow ups/consultations conducted when a malady has been identified? 
Also, what are those 4-5 States? I'm all but certain I reside in one of them as we had (have?) only a handful of diagnostic companies dominating Market share, one being the aforementioned, which is abysmal... and ultimately reminds me of the telecoms spying on their customers and subsequently getting legal immunity to do so in return of carving out State-sactioned monopolies of services in localities for the select few who played along with the State in doing so. 
I saw it from both sides working in diagnostics, and earlier in my university years trying to get an x-ray without medical insurance; which is why I have such a keen interest in seeing a much needed change in this space. 
What do you think the efficacy and potential is in the aforementioned online medical services achieving this? And do you think its realistic for them to accept BTC? Would you join if they did so? 
And finally, and this is purely hypothetical, but what do you see yourself doing when you retire? The typical lecture/conference circus with the occasional golf excursion, or something with more substance?

There is an amazing paper that made a big part of Bitcoin 'click' for me back in 2010 or so on the conclusions drawn from a study and analysis of the so-called 'System-D,' from 2009 after the financial crisis was in full swing--which is pretty much the Global Dark-Market(s)/Shadow Economy.
It's essentially the 2nd largest Economy in the World, at 10 trillion back then, that may have changed since then but China's GDP numbers are about as real their election polls... but anyhow, it's core principals essentially rely on the massive rise in onboarding more unbanked/undocumented people into the SystemD economy (shadow economy) via Internet based e-commerce via online goods/services.
Bitcoin is essentially the 'how' to the 'what, where and when' equation and analysis. It's been a crazy run so far, but we now have the tools to do this, especially as Layer 2 is shaping out nicely, we just need to have a Free Internet as its backbone.
All of this reminds me of YTcracker's lyrics:

No, I will categorically go on record and say: it is NEVER going to happen. I'd be elated to be wrong, honestly I would; but if their anything the State will not allow is for it to have a major cash cow like War on Drugs to be impeded without grave consequences. 
It didn't nor can it deter more DNM from rising up in its ashes, but that was never the point, it was to make an example of a person who honestly was naive and far too reckless (horrid op-sec!!!) with his safety to see what is in front of him. I have been listening to this all day today: 
Why he came back from Asia is beyond me, he even makes a point to say to VJ that the money is worthless if you're behind bars. Hindsight is always 50/50 of course, but I just cannot find any reason why he would choose the Bay Area of all places to come back to and continue to operate SR from there.
Its sad, but if I were him I would have asked that the million they raised for his defense go to BTC instead, had he cashed out in Dec 2017 and got back in, he would likely not to have to worry about missed meals and phone calls for the rest of his stay and had a nice fund to buy books, art supplies and other things to help him cope with being in prison for life. Honestly, I'd throw some satoshis his way for him to do a podcast or something from prison every few months, just to know he was ok at his point.
I recently had to live with someone whose son was in prison, and it was pure misery as they seldom dedicated any funds to his medication or food budget; the messages he'd leave on the LAN line were heartbreaking as the answering machine was in the living room near my room which had thin walls--I'd try to pretend I didn't hear them most times and would put my headphones on if I was home, but I later sought to stop and listen to see if he'd ever get better. He tried to commit suicide several times in the time I lived at this place, its... fucking brutal to just think of it, let alone put yourself in that position as he had severe mental illness. 
My heart goes out to Ross, and his family as I understand have gone to near bankruptcy to get him released, but its to the point that one must accept reality and do what is best given the circumstances: the fact is we ALL lost that battle, the Internet as we know has become and will likely remain a quasi Corporate-State surveillance apparatus for the most part. 
I just hope he can take solace in knowing that we will win this War.

Hey, dude, look into my post History and look for Randy; he has been helping out since 2016 or so. 
This is the real reason I keep coming back here, because despite all the noise your plight is what crypto was meant to solve. 
The food situation is a severe problem, one growing World wide, and one that has been a main focus of the last 10 years of my Life. Luckily Crypto came along and gave me a framework to work with. 
PM me if you want to chat and I can share more resources, but suffice it to say: nothing short of empowering local communities to grow food on such a scale to do CSA and accept it directly for crypto will be needed.

Yup, you should look into Blythe Master's role in not just creating the CDS that led to the financial crisis, but how she was on the commodities desk that wreaked havoc on the World for basic foodstuffs. (Andrew Jackson comes to mind about people like Her.) 
It led to a ton of civil unrest, specifically the Arab Spring.
Funny enough, despite her nearly cartoonish diabolical nature, she sucked at it and was fired because she couldn't turn a profit. Its not just these guys are just evil, they are also blind to their own incompetence and suck at making full use of the manipulation. I guess that's the benefit of knowing you can get bailed out for failing.
So this is why I didn't understand, nor do I to this day, why most of you are elated that these corrupt idiots are showing up in droves paying lip-service. 
Let me make this clear: They are not your friends, they do not care about you, or this project nor its goals, and they won't make you rich.

They're salesmen with one goal, put rubes who want to buy into an image into one of those cars before they realize its a farce. 
I like Tesla's sales model, get away from pushy salesman and browse and buy only what you want and the only people you have to deal with is finance, who act more as gatekeepers not as people working on commission trying to up-sale you on a P100D you neither need or want for your 20 mile daily commute.

2009 was too early for most to even grasp it unless you were a hardnosed cypherpunk, and even then most rejected it; I personally heard about in 2010 with tons of debt, and I began researching it but I was a broke recent college grad, I finally jumped in 2011 when I saw its utility in various aspects and its potential to disrupt the massive monoliths that brought about the financial crisis.
I don't miss my opportunity for endless riches anymore as that was a longshot at best, as I got so much more from this whole undertaking and a new appreciation for Life itself; its really the community from back then that I miss more than anything: a bunch of misfit, idealistic anarchist(s) wanting nothing more than to change the World!
It was so cool just hanging out with so many crazy people in one room talking about our respective Industries and how to tackle them with this new tech.
Some of us actually went out in the World and did just that, but in that time this community changed so much that by 2014 it was entirely unrecognizable. In 2019 I can't really say I have any interest in doing much more than occasionally visiting this place and seeing the silliness and memes, whereas before I was a regular at meetups in several countries/continents, ran workshops with some OG bitcoiners, and founded a startup in this space etc...
To think this place was the same place that made Satoshi's Forest/Sean's Outpost a real thing is almost inconceivable. Even Bitcoin Talk forum is just a den of ICO BS and fake TA now that I can't even be bothered to look at it. Meetups are dead except when we hit the crazy rallies, and then its noobs going on about alt/ICO scams.
Times have changed, of course, but the Bitcoin community has lost its soul for reaching for the moon, and not just in price, I mean in true moonshot ideals that made this place exciting and worthy of caring.
The price has become the only obsession, so its monotonous to us who have seen several ATH and didn't budge.

3 BTC is a lot, regardless of its current USD price (which personally is still a lot to me), and it shouldn't be dismissed as a pittance. Do it right and you will never have to worry about getting hacked or Goxxed, which is perhaps the worst thing to be exposed to when you are in the early stages of BTC. Obviously you should keep the private key, should it ever get lost you can just transfer and resend.

Care to elaborate? Many working poor do not or cannot make use of these so-called social nets because they do not qualify for them, nor could they realistically do so for even a short duration as their impositions to encourage social mobility is hindered.  
I'm a proponent of UBI, but more importantly I also have first hand and intimate knowledge of the way Social Waok is done in this country. 
I'd like to hear your argument against it, especially as you think its a 'good idea'.
I'll be the first to say, its implementation will be a nightmare at the State level, as its a bureaucratic nightmare; but Aurora Coin didn't give us enough metrics and analytics to see how we could do at the crypto level, either. 
I think UBI, in its most effective level, will be Community issued and ideally Bitcoin based, though alts may work, too. My best Example for how it will be done is Andreas A. The guy put in endless amounts of time and resources, and the community, primarily via a generous donor, thanked him for his work and allotted him a sum in BTC commiserate for his passion/drive/effort and overall contribution. 
Short of it following something like that I think it will be an utter failure, but I look forward to be proven wrong.

What do you make of the situation in Venezuela, and the parallels to your own Petro-based dollar/loonie (whatever you moose riders call it these days ;)) and the implications it can have and has had on your economy?
Moreover, what will the seemingly inevitable trade Wars provoked by the current US administration have on this outlook?
I think Canada's resource based currency is not capable of putting in the top 30 nations from an economic standpoint, and that its GDP is way over inflated in terms of actual economic output, but this is also likely due to its small population in respect to most of said top 30 nations. For example, its in my estimation that Indonesia has more productive output in just a handful of islands alone than the entirety of your country, despite its low living conditions, if only because their isn't mass death waves due to famine.

They flat out want nothing to do with them. 
[I recently wrote about this and spoke in greater detail about it, as I've been involved with the stark impositions on the industry]( as a grower-cultivator since 2012--I have land in Colorado and will be growing industrial hemp along with my other cultures (unfortunately pushed to 2016 due to upcoming commitments) and the indignation of this is beyond words. 
The portrayal of this segment is quite tame if you know or are involved with the actual situation, [take a look at the video I linked to in my response]( to some ignorant poster to get a better understanding of what is occurring over there (eg para-military style escorting of fiat to safe houses, business owners and employees living in constant fear of banks closing their accounts and conform to what poor services they do get).
In addition to the flagrant hypocrisy of it all, as noted at 2:40 in this video, its the misallocation of resources that are squandered which are better spent on much needed infrastructure and improving the logistics of goods and services, in addition to investment into supporting other sectors of the cannabis industry, but perhaps more importantly the sequestered potential in the cannabis industry in terms of employment and growth. 
This is a sector that has attracted people from all over the World, from [former NASA scientists]( to your average [would-be journeymen]( in a small community I'm a part of we have recently been reached by two professional accountants from the Philippines who have made the transition to Colorado to try and break into the industrial hemp industry--and this is by no means atypical. Not to mention the constant requests for guidance and info from other farmers from the US wanting to get in only to find that they are barred from financial services from day one; which is a death kneel for agricultural operations that have lead times up to 1-5 years depending on scope and capacity. 
Combine this with the fact that traditional loans or lines of credits are out of the question, as is crop insurance and subsidies which many other farmers rely on as a safety-line to hedge their losses (think 2013 floods in Colorado). And this is not even mentioning the shit we deal with the DEA...
Long story short (kind of) there is so much untapped potential here for crypto to shine, what it requires is capital from investors with a long term view of ROI and some savvy entrepreneurs and marketing people to break the flood gate, reaching and capitalizing on this demographic won't happen overnight but when it does it will be something to behold; I'd like to volunteer to help in some capacity to do so because although I lack the personal finances to do so myself I find this so imperative--I also encourage the crypto-rich and VCs to direct their efforts here. 
This is actually why I got into crypto: to disrupt and help correct that which is unjust and perverse.
These guys are risk takers in there own right, believe it or not, and while initially reluctant they will listen if they can be convinced their vested interests can be secured. Albeit with some hand-holding as they aren't the most tech savvy.

They're not a scam, but they have been lacking in several aspects for some time now, including getting back to people regarding technical issues, unfortunately; with that said, I'm not sure if you can still export the account, this will show your private key, at which point you can sweep into any other mobile wallet. Anything will do for such a small sum, really.

You're probably right about that, in some ways, but I was referring to myself in that statement if you hadn't realized; if you haven't noticed from my stream of recent posts I've actually have been in the btc community since 2011 in many capacities. 
I've helped in various aspects during two national crises with the help of many members here and elsewhere, both of which you can see my involvement in my post history on this account alone. 
I've been an active member of several BTC/crypto communities in the US and Europe for over 7 years; I've done hands on workshops to introduce new people to crypto gathered after years of first-hand experience as I had an actual startup in this space, which as I have mentioned before has become the vast minority of people in this space for some time. 
I've done presentations in many conferences focusing on crypto viability to overcome financial censorship, I've worked alongside some of very cool people you probably never even heard of in this community to do all of this, too. 
Judging by your account, assuming you don't have any others, you seem to have joined during the price spike in late 2013, which is when I made this (at the time) throwaway to separate my BTC talk account. 
Also, let me remind you of your recent remarks to Bcasher's:

Preface: I'm an AnCap.
This is what I mean, I think communist and socialist have one thing right about most of the poor who consider themselves staunch 'capitalists,' one: they don't realize how it really works and what it takes to maintain itself, and second: they all think they are temporarily shamed millionaires. So they side with the powerful and rich who disenfranchise those via legislation and vote against very obvious anti-poor laws, who can be as powerful and rich by having access to lots of disposable, cheap labour.
Crony-capitalism has to be done away with and those practices you talked about are exactly why they get to have advantages that they do that allow them to send lobbyists to those prostitutes who sell themselves for such concessions. 
My argument was that I ask for nothing from the State other than to be left the fuck alone, nor do I owe them for the typical arguments made by those who are proponents: schooling and roads. I personally don't think it was anything special, in fact I would have preferred to have invested that money into more productive things like runway money for my business ventures/startup as well as some preventative health based procedures. 
My contention is that to finally rid ourselves of this archaic nation-state model we must first realize that Megacorps can easily take their place (if we succeed) and create an even worse dystopic future. You need only look at Big Pharma, MIC, and the Petrochemical corps to see how fucked things can get really fast. 
I'm all for Commerce, Free Markets, and an Agorist approach to all of them... but we have neither in the Real World outside of what things like Bitcoin can operate over, which is ultimately very little so far and doesn't have an inherit enforceability outside of protocol itself. That must change if we are to create a better alternative. 
And as far as I'm concerned this Global Statist system is already dead, its reached a self-cannibalistic mode since at least 2008 (perhaps as early as 1913 when you really think about it as it led to World Wars) so we might as well get as much useful information and access to resources to build a better Future from it if we can.

Awesome, this and the influx of Bitcoin sent to his defense fund should really show how much merit the 'no one gives a fuck about who you are, or what you did' argument really has. 
I just wish Edward would stop aligning his view to that of the US biased narrative, not for my sake, but he is truly wishing for something that will never be; because I think for all of Oliver's segments flaws that is truly what you can expect not just from the *supposed* 4X% ignorant US populace, but that of the equally apathetic and uninformed and ignorant World population. The beauty is that those he has empowered to make a difference have the resourcefulness, resolve and creative capability of 10's of those who simply don't care--as the aforementioned efforts have demonstrated. So the numbers game isn't as significant as some will make it out to be.

Well then you're missing the point of why social nets were created in the first place then. In an ideal society you wouldn't need them at all, but Reality is messy and complicated, thus I do think they need to be analyzed, and thoroughly so to be accurately quantified in utility. 
You're right, I don't get how or why say an engineering student has to load on tons of debt while working and has to go without eating because they can't afford to eat to afford rent, tuition and books but people who have tons of kids get housing/food/clothing etc... paid for. Its absurd, and makes no sense to me-it only encourages perpetuating poverty and misery--but I have seen enough of it to know its real. (I personally became a chef during my time university because of that same situation, though I never sought assistance as I already knew what it entailed.) 
What's worse is that the US culture has some sort of sadistic POV that deems something like that just 'paying your dues,' when in reality paying for post-Highschool schooling is a recent phenomena, what most do not understand or refuse to acknowledge is the physiological and mental health issues that arise from being food insecure, calories deficient as well as the trauma that takes place. Anecdote: Greek kids were passing out in class due to malnutrition during the crisis during 2008 and now have a huge social problem with depression and suicide as well as the civil unrest the had. 
The Human condition is such that if it was Hungry and desperate enough it went to War and committed all kinds of atrocities--we haven't evolved past that, and if you look around you can see examples of it are still here in Modern Society. 
A negative tax system is only useful if you have gainful employment, many of the labourforce won't in the next years with the advent of automation. I know its displaced more than anything else, and I personally see that as a net positive as Human drudgery shoul dbe done away with; the problem is that re-training isn't always an option. I've personally done it and can move between 3 Industries at will, my goal is for it to be 5, but I'm an anomaly and its come at a Huge cost and sacrifice that I know most won't even consider let alone fulfill. 
Many working class people are in tons of debt and what money they have left after that is left for basic necessities... and unfortunately most of that is squandered on pointless affectations (Apple phones still have long lines) so they eat subsidized processed and nutrient deficient food, which is why diabetes and heart disease kills more people than anything else in the US.   
So in your system, those who have no wages do not benefit from this and thus the system is compounded as the poor/impoverished always reduce their quality of food during a budget constrain, which is culturally fucking stupid as that is what keeps you alive and healthy. 
I don't know about the official budget numbers, as the State's figures are always skewed to fit a narrative, but conceptually if you want to do this at the State level: I think its entirely possible via a flat VAT system, which while not perfect can be accomplished--I saw first hand in the EU its many pitfalls, but its useful to have the tax included into the price rather than this overly complicated fractured tax system based on goods/services the State deems more or less harmful. Moreover, they do not have a perpetual underclass under the yoke of student debt and ever diminishing opportunities.
 
I personally think that alongside UBI raw food, meaning uncooked vegetables/fruit/meat, should be tax exempt though. The medical costs for just the aging boomers is bankrupting the US, can you imagine if/when all the millennials (who are now the biggest cohort) with poor eating habits and destroyed health are on-boarded to a publicly funded medical system? Its literally game over and it will create Global shortages of labour and goods/services.

I'll take a stab at this as I have some experience as a founder and a semi-early adopter in this space; they're using and weaponizing Human instinct and behaviour, specifically greed and ego.
We've reached a saturation point where most founders care more about funding and growth than they do about 'core principals,' best recent examples being Coinbase/Bitpay/Shapeshift etc... in the West. I don't have proof in front of me of it, but would anyone be really surprised if Jihan/Bitmain had a member of the PRC of the helm of that thing?
If they want funding, or need 'regulatory assistance' to keep them out of jail or getting erased as in the case in China then they play ball, simple as that: they want to keep their baby alive, and I can understand that part, but when its to the detriment of the community and what the goals are then a more principled individual will do what is necessary and shut it down and move on to the next project. For a hacker its a much welcome restart to leave with some funds to start something new after a short break and a restart, but this is no longer a community of hackers, they're blatant money men from Goldman Sachs and predatory Silicon Valley VC funds riding the coat tails of those who came before...
The true hackers that built this tech are few and far between these days around here and that is why their methods ultimately work in my view. Its cunning Social engineering, this way they can misdirect and misinform from the cover of a Bitmain or a Coinbase rather than be the boogeymen stunting progress, which would further radicalize some people around here. (I'm not saying Blockstream are perfect, far from it actually, but many Devs were here making commits and pushing BIPs back when this was net negative use of their time, earning their reputation in what has been an awesome meritocracy for me personally.)
Its clear to me that nations can/do overtly put all the KYC/AML bullshit on exchanges to vet those who will stay and exploit them down the road as they're too 'committed' for their own good at that point, in fact I want them to, because all it will do is eventually force migration on to platforms like Bisq, where it belonged all along.
KYC/AML BTMs are a joke, they're here for the low hanging fruit, anything they say about access is mouth service; most noobs don't go to them unless one of us Nerds are there hold their hand and convince them its better when you already have some.
Things like Dorsey 's cash app has gotten alarmingly sensitive about potential trading, I was an early adopter and after 2.5 years they shut down my account because I was moving more money through it than I previously had--first they wouldn't approve my Bitcoin withdraw option which is what I really wanted and went silent in the process then they just closed the account without warning. They did allow me to pull my funds off the account (into fiat). I still haven't gotten a response other than an automated and generic 'violation of terms of service.' So, I've since moved on.
The arm of the State probably imposed them to close anything that sent a red flag as a term of agreement as a money processor; so I don't blame him as his core business is still in Square and he can't risk having that impaired. Dorsey himself seems to be a throw back to the old days, where it was more about the doing the impossible than the money making, but then he's already a billionaire: suffice it to say, ultimately his hands are tied, but I commend his commitment thus far.
A part of me just hopes that in addition to funding core devs in the public eye, he also sends some dev money toward the Bisq/Wasabi team discreetly.

I had a similar encounter with a professor discussing politics and economics on the tram at Zurich ETH about 6 years ago. He had no idea what I was on about. And now look what Switzerland is like in terms of crypto legislation and such. These guys are fossils, and I question what value they ever really had beyond lecturers, if I'm entirely honest. 
We need to think about this in terms of how Linux/Unix ended up taking over the server and smart phone market share, they did it softly without anyone really noticing until it became the norm to use opensource free software. The so-called technorati of the World are already clued up to bitcoin and crypto as a whole, the rest of the non-initiated are what's up for grab, which is what is essentially the center of the bell curve and the bulk of most Humanity.
Look at it in these terms and you'll see the necessary adoption to even scratch the surface for something like hyperbitcoinization will only occur when you can onboard people who don't want nor do they see the value in being your own bank or the benefits of having a decentralized monetary system.

Not surprising, actually; I think Japan held the title for the nation with the highest savings per capita of all developed nation/economies for decades. House-wifes routinely stash money away, as they are the one's who manage finances in Japanese culture. 
There was a series of articles noting Japan's low savings saving rates in the past 5-8 years, but I always thought that was just what was held at the banks/investment firms. Good to know I wasn't that far off, I thought it was closer to half a trillion--then again this was during a strong yen so perhaps was correct at the time. Inflation creeps in regardless, which is rather sad as much of this is likely life savings, rainy day money or inheritances... and Abenomics shows no sign of slowing down.

Do you think [joining this network and piggybacking off their system]( would be a viable option? I'm normally not one to pester retailers to accept bitcoin, but I think this cool idea that should materialize: I can imagine a Doctor's without borders doing joint consultations/diagnostics remotely to offset the those on the ground.
They also have lab test and Rx services over the web, I imagine there has to be a way to get a physician on your state that can issue/order a rx at a pharmacy, but I'm not sure what that would entail.
[This is how it works and bare in mind that was almost 4.5 years ago.]( I'd like to know what the state of the art is in medical devices to compliment these services. I know there are apps and stuff on iphones that can measure heart rates, but what else?

This woman has no fucking shame, and despite whatever **short-term gains** can be gained from this PR stunt I think we do ourselves a great disservice allowing this person and her misdeeds to be associated with what crypto's main objective was.


It may be that Reddit is often mis-infomred *gibberish,* which I whole-heartedly agree, but take a look at that link up there and see why JPM settled out of court during the FARC investigation, the energy sector manipulation in both California and Michigan. And you'll see the same face on that, too.
The former actually had a severe impact on halting and subsequently decommissioning the most dangerous nuclear power plant in the US because of their direct involvement in the energy sector in CA, and [prolonged offsetting and diversifying the energy needs for millions of people in the largest economy in the US]( while endangering said people in ways that can't be calculated. So her direct involvement has had not just a negative economical impact, but also an environmental, and also a health-safety issue. 
Her nefarious involvement in these actions are well documented, and I would argue it is anti-intellectual gibbersih to deny it. 


Good observation, though, I would add that she is: Graza + Karpeles + Brewster rolled into one. 
PS: What is even more ironic is that it was Bloomberg itself who went on to paint her in this light as the incompetent sociopath that she is--she cannot even cover her lies and JPM had to divest from all the commodities she was involved with when they were caught, incurring huge losses. And now all of a sudden she is the darling of the Crypto-Revolution by the same publication?

Actually, BTC did attempt to do that with colored coins; it was just way ahead of its time. Most of those ICOs are scams, and did more harm to Crypto's log term reputation in the broader public's eye; and while ETH itself is not nor should it be held responsible for such things I would still like to see them focus on the primary goals they set out to complete instead of things like Crypto Kitties. 
I don't own ETH, nor have I ever owned its, but looking at this with fundamental principals in mind I cannot share your enthusiasm at this time. Perhaps at a later date when these things finally pan out, but until then, I'm just skeptical of its actual use-cases. I never liked its premine, or its altering of the blockchain after the DAO, and looking at the bloat and node centralization it doesn't inspire confidence, either.

Big fan of Tesla, but I need to step in: I was actually  going to work for them while I was still in the Auto-Industry, I got my offer after 2 visits to the factory. So I got to see the lay out and the factory at Fremont as it changed as I was going for a position in the Supply Chain/Logistics and it certainly isn't set up for Y nor is there any room for it logistically speaking--Model 3 was way behind schedule, granted it was Elon time, but it was the logistics of the assembly line that were pushed far past its tolerances in addition to QC on the assembly line.
Sparks/Nevada seem like a possibility, but that new factory in China is coming online soon, and will probably be the ideal candidate as they had to refit the assembly line(s) for Model 3 several times in Fremont. I imagine they'd have to do the same at Sparks.
Second, there is no basis for your 30 year projection, the oldest Tesla was the first roadster, which is actually a PITA to keep on the road; also, parts for the current models alone are scarce and if you go near the factory you can see a body shop with tons of S/X/3 sitting there waiting for repair parts to be shipped out as the defects/damage is quite significant as they were in the Model 3 ramp. It can take months before getting something critical like a bumper or a dash to a body shop outside of the Tesla repair centers.
Lastly, as this can go on: The powerwall requires you invest in solar panels on your home or land, which if you're state hopping as you mentioned, it won't exactly be of benefit to you and you're better off net metering any excess energy back into the grid .
I share your excitement for Tesla as this is all really cool tech, and I'm convinced they will eventually iron out all the kinks, if they can turn a profit, but... there is a reason Tesla has almost gone out of business so many times, they shoot for the stars in hopes of getting to the moon. They live and breath hype, but lack a lot of critical parts of the equation, so seeing how the sausage is made is very eye-opening.
In my view the biggest priority is that they still need to figure out how to get all the Model 3 deliveries to Europe and Asia without damage, in order to not hemorrhage money for repairs/parts/delays/rentals on the other side of the World, before they can conceivably jump to Y, Semi or Roadster. Also, I cannot realistically anticipate the 500k+ deposits this time around, which was a significant cash injection. If they see more than 80k Globally for the Y I'll be super surprised and excited.
I've driven all 3 and the Model 3 was my favorite, the X isn't really an improvement over the S besides the winged doors to dance, so I can't see Y being better than a performance Model 3.
Edit: 


Funny, did you spot the Model 3 in the pic and get motivated to write all of that?

Welcome to the outcome of a 'regulated Bitcoin' path, if we are to lower ourselves to these confines in the name of mass adoption we shall soon find ourselves as irrelevant and obscure as this option shows us it is. 
I swear, when I started I thought we were experimenting with building a new economy with the pursuit of a free and just means of transferring value to one another without an intermediary, thus brining commerce to the closest thing to a Free Market we have ever had; as years have gone by I just don't think that is the focus anymore. 


I lament what normalizing this kind of thinking has done, and I fear what may become of our collective efforts if this is the best outcome we achieve... it's Killer App serving as a re-branded Paypal clone which no one uses. 
If Bitcoin is to fall into the hands of regulators and those who are quick to acquiesce to it,--whom are at present dominating Market Share in exchange/services and being the main point of funding--it is really troubling as I'm really starting to wonder how this outcome, as bleak as it is, isn't entirely inevitable. 
I'm not at the pessimistic stage of this journey just yet, given certain small and poorly funded projects I actually still have reason to be optimistic, but it is sobering to see the 'mass adoption' cult and Chart-humpers having what they so long sought for staring back at them with nothing to show for it to the detriment of us all; it epitomizes the definition of a Pyrrhic victory: sure you got paypal to 'play along' with your nerd money, but at what cost? Where is your moon? 


Indeed. This is a point of reflection for the community, and perhaps an inflection point in our trajectory.

Its not as easy as you'd think unfortunately, farmers really are the most risk-prone in action, yet the most risk-averse in finance, culture I have ever met in my Life.
I've come full circle into thinking that only small scale Ag and Community gardens will be the true adopters; IBM's initiative has been an utter failure with on-boarding multi-nationals to utilize crypto through the 'blockchain' only narrative. They had an amazing opportunity to reach many farmers who supply to those corps, and as a relic of the past they could have redefined this entire landscape and their company as whole for the 21st century; instead their contract bidding/data base sales tactics run too deep at Big Blue and they already lost what momentum they had. 
Most of their development is in serving finance, and to be honest that is just a fucking a waste of time and talent for what is already an ossified relic of the 20th century.  
Ukraine and Venezuela's path share a lot in common, and makes me wish things like Aurora gave us more data to work with. I know things are bad, but I just hope war, civil or otherwise doesn't break out and fragment the People further.

That doesn't answer the question as miners are not a fleeting, transient end-user of the most ubiquitous Spyware Marketed as a 'Social Media' platform; Miners are deeply invested in this system for a myriad of causes and reasons and seek to profit from its ultimate success, or at least continued operation.
None of which seem to care or even see any value in forking the system even if it does increase the blocksize. I'm all for larger blocksizes, I have had to wait hours recently for a tx, but even so XT is the brainchild of a 'known entity' who got Gavin to play along for some reason, which may ultimately validate why Satoshi ceased communication with him and the community entirely. I'd like to believe in Gavin, but these continued efforts just make me more and more suspicious of his motives and of him as a Person despite all the work he has done in the past for our ecosystem--which, I say with a heavy heart.

Varies, there is a long-held thought process that potential/kinetic energy is a viable option for electrical storage, this of course is undermining all the progress Tesla, MIT et al are making with battery storage systems, which is actually far more favourable in terms of practical applications. Add-on infrastructure to existing infrastructure seems nice on paper until you deal with pro-longed build sites, delays, paperwork etc... to do a project at scale. 
And the water option described above is a mild one in terms of feasibility, I have heard of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems that will use old train carts on a mountain top in certain circles. Its gotten to a point that I see it only as an engineer's play-thing essentially.

Very true, which is why I always encourage the unintiated to attend a bitcoin meetup first and foremost before being 'convinced' its for them. I speak as a person who went through the steep learning curve with all the trials and tribulations of setting up Bitcoin-qt to recieve my coins, and then learning about transfering coins, and eventually cold storing coins after I sent a bank wire and waited 3-4 weeks to get some coins--thinking soon after I had been ripped off after reading some posts on BCT. (If I recall the bank wire was just as much, if not more after volatility, than the intial amount of coins I actually recieved.)
At least at a meetup you can see the benefits of having a community to answer your questions and discuss the merits of current projects and the challenges of on-going development within the community maybe toss some tiny amount of bits around to noobs to show the mechanics, and if drinks and good conversation follow 'why this all matters.' 
In my opinion it answers the 'why should I care about this nerd money' question better than anything any evangelist, even Andreas', can conjure up.
Once there you can then buy some from a member of the community in person, and if all else fails give him some of yours if you are that eager to 'convince' him. 
With that said, as a past customer who you used to sing CB's praise here I'm not even upset anymore; I'm just resigned to a tepid form of dissapointment and embarrassment everytime I see these posts.

Exactly, the money is held in escrow, and even if the product says delivered the funds are only released when YOU the buyer release them. I had to wait a few days, my fault not theres, to get my items and the delivery status had shown 'delivered' days before I released the funds.

I had something similar happen early on with a petty sum that turned into a (at the time) somewhat significant amount afterward.
First thing is to stop while you're on top, take your coins off the website and place them in 4-5 individual addresses in [cold storage]( 
Be sure to back up the private address in some form, you can obviously opt to buy a trezor but since you're the gambling type the harder they are to access, the better they are for you.
Keep 1 or 2 in your mobile wallet to show people what they are, buy the odd thing online and maybe even place the odd bet if you ever feel the need. 
If you really want to do something with it and make a difference, take a 1/4 and become a seller on Paxful; if I was 18 I would be all for getting some real work experience with profits that could help promote adoption where it is most needed.

Slick UI, as mentioned before.

While a part of me wants to believe that *should* be the case, and a better use case for this logic would have been the SR stolen funds sold to fellow conspirators, the fact of the matter is that we shouldn't confuse or desire for a payments system to act as a moral arbiter. It should be a-sympathetic to anything other than inputs that create outputs in a secure cryptographically veriable way, nothing else. 
And the fact of the matter is that BTC-e actually resumed withdraws quite quickly, too; if you go to the troll box many were disapointed they couldn't capitalize on the perceived 'crisis.' 
If anything this should be a reminder that you should never keep your funds on any 3rd party system, be it a DarkMarket or a Bulgarian exchange ran by Anons.

It's vending machine, as in singular, as there is only one; and the operation is a medical marijuana dispensary only so you have to show your red-card/medical card while doing the transaction. Recreational dispensaries, which only require proof of age, are taking even bigger risks in CO actually. But this isn't entirely their fault as you can see the refusal on the part of the Federal Reserve in earlier threads, and this has been an ongoing saga. 
My personal view is that paying for marijuana with BTC is more of a net benefit to the ecosystem, the merchant and long term adoption than it is for the end user for the reasons you have described. But it should still be encouraged for this reason alone as every time you enter a dispensary in CA you have to show your medical card to gain access.
If you want to remain anon and pay with BTC then stick to DNM, but this is actually awesome as up until now most are reluctant to even consider the option through the most convoluted of options--which exist today and act as middle men.

That seems a bit excessive, I've been playing with my RP2 for a while now and barring the expensive fancy case, I don't see why the costs should be over $100 at all, even less if you DIY. The biggets cost being the 64gb sd card. Your projects cost may be the case if include keyboard, mouse into it. 
In fact, if there is demand for it I will take it upon myself to do a limited run of them, can you convince, say 7-10 people to go in for $100 +SH? Count me in if you can, and we will work out the details and ETA; they will be highly utilitarian, though, so acrylic cases but with a SanDisc micro SDs, and phone charger power supplies that (while not advised by some on the RPI forum) still works well for a node that will have no periphery devices draining it.

While it would be easy to criticize the spot price of BTC I think its short sighted, I bought two and loaded one for demo purposes and to be quite honest the spread wasn't that big of a deal.  They ultimately have to monetize their services some how.

Snowden on his own admission knew the NSA (HR person?) would know it was him; his house in Hawaii with is gf still in it (who thought he was out traveling for work) was searched, and his alliby of being sick was discovered to be false not long after the release to Glenn and media became public. (Laura had it, before, though.)
So, not exactly, he had sound OPSEC, and was 3 steps ahead of the NSA with the help of Wikileaks staff as it all unfolded in the public kabuki theater called international politics; and even then he stayed a month in Moscow in absolute uncertainty of what to do next when his passport was revoked back in HK. 
So, he didn't exactly dodge anything, he and Julian played their hand well as you would expect from an OG Cypherpunk-Cryptoanarchist with connections with heads of State in S. America, despite the NSA's best efforts.


Until Stealth addresses are common place and seamless, I will never be able to consider those avenues secure; mych less resiliant as they have a single point of failure: centralized servers. And even then, they operate on the Hydra model, they do get hit and the State tries to make an example of them (ie Silk Road 1/2).


I stopped caring about the coins, and considered them long gone after this point, as I had none in Gox myself: 


Ok, semantics aside, there have been too many coins purchased, or sold from exchanges and atms with ids attached to them these days that could be tied to names/address/age... such that  that it wouldn't take an agency like GCHQ to target one person and find out that he sold/bought to 12 different others in a short matter of time. 
The concept of this level of security is true, I've read the white paper more than once and was won over by its security/trustless.p2p nature, I'm not denying that; but because this community has fallen victim to the *convienence over security* disease, Bitcoin has almost lost that attribute entirely in my mind, because few are willing to got through the trouble of getting 6 degrees of seperation to buy/sale/hold their own funds.
I'm not trying to play the role of a Buttcoiner, I'm actually an enthusiast and advocate of Crytocurrency by extension of Cypherpunk philosphy and Cryptoanarchism, which is why I voice my criticisms the way that I do; but in its current state, it is clear Bitcoin cannot achieve the things you mentioned. It can in theory, and we are working toward it in own way, it just hasn't done it yet. 
Which is why funding projects like OpenBazzar and Unsystem is just as important (if not more) to the ecosystem as *HODLING* and much more valuable then praising Coinbase for getting wall street leeches and parasites in this space.

True, but no one in either of those ventures were FORCED to use or invest in those currencies/services; I however, as a victim of FOREX market rigging, was imposed to do so as I was traveling thorughout many European countries on USD based savings and was subject to these manipulated rates. My standard of living and quality of Life suffered in a real way as result of this; to what degree is hard to calculate, but it was felt.
There is a very distinct difference between both of those scenarios, and while I cannot help but pine for what N&amp;B could of done for Cyprus by now, all those other ones were obvious scams.

Its archiac and quaint to think borders are what stop this type of behaviour, it isn't. Its quite likely that even the threat of not allowing these companies in other countries to enter the US market (biggest consumer Market in the World) if they don't play by the NSA's rules would quickly quell any kind of dissent within a boardroom. (Lets no forget the cables and leaks had inside information of private companies from around the World in addition to governments.)
What we need is decentralized manufacturing owned and managed by people with similair aims, goals and philosophies. 
Case in point; if you have followed the nature of these events for any length of time you will come to realize that its actually the UK's 'intellegence aganencies' (not the US') who has had supremecy in mastering this level of intrusion--even Snowden says it in various interviews--and yet I still want a Raspberry pi. Why? Because the company makes it there mission statement in selling bare-bone modular and scalable computing systems that allow any individual (if so inclined) to pick and choose the means and methods to create their own PC/Hardware device depnding on their own level of Opsec and purpose. 
This is what we as a community should be focusing on, how do we use crypto currency to shift from the current paradigm of FoxCON churning out the NSA-spec devices that flood the Market to consumers Worldwide to creating a robust decentralized opensource device industry, thus taking advantage of a more meanful victory with actual substance with real-life and meaningful advantages.

Dude, the name of the game is to be Unbanked, Brawker is a cool component to achieve that end. Its not cheating, just our first sucessful iteration in acomplishing that in our nascent and emerging ecosystem and economy. 
We need more 3rd bill payment services, and Bitsumo services competing with one another if we are ever going to see those sweet discounts back. Most of whom will sit on it and sell at a profit, or add a premium and sale locally. 
Merchants giving discounts directly for what constitute at best 1-5% of sales was never sustainable, and quite honestly, rather foolish if maintained in a prolonged fashion--it could past the mustard as a PR/Marketing campaign for a while, that is until the *bean counters* start to ask questions about its efficacy and ROI. 


I defintely saw a shift here and in BT since early 2013, in fact I joined here because of the misinformation I had to correct; but this isn't my first 'rodeo' as it were, in getting something entirely niche into a mainstream for mass consumption. 
It is the Nature of things when you start to monetize things, people with vested interests try to assert themselves with promises of large profits and political clout if certain 'compromises' to core princeples are made in hopes of being able to profit from it.

So, then is Hungary or Croatia or any other non-Euro country more Sovereign than say Italy, Ireland or Greece? Because, while the latter nations are in bad shape, the former are even worst-off. (I used to believe that currency was a defacto attribute of Sovereignty until I actually went to these places and saw it for myself, and confirmed that they possessed Sovereignty in name only.)
I'm not advocating they, or anyone else get the Euro, far from it and I hope they never do; but simply being in its realm of influence (economical, strategic or geo-political) has had a detrimental effect to its economy and respective populace, Hungary has terrible inflation, unemployment and Croatia has the same with 25% VAT on everything to ensure their membership in the Eurozone. (All of these were impositions or a consequence by Brussels, by the the way.)
And then one asks, what about a place like Montenegro that isn't even in the EU but uses the Euro? 
I think we should watch Lithuania as the canary in the coal mine, for the fate of the Euro/EU post CHF peg; this reminds me of Slovenia all over again: a poor E.

Difficult to say, really; mobile/web wallets are pretty stripped down, and offer little more than scan/send/receive, also worth considering is that most that adopt them are likely usually guided by other bitcoiners tipping them to adopt it, so its probably a bit less... but this is merely conjecture and based on my personal anecdotal experience.

Watch until end, but focus on 5:30 onward. Pinch is really intelligent, and a pleasure to meet and speak with in person.
It was hard to believe we would go from Dubplate culture and Pirate radio, to eventually going mainstream with RedBull events sponsorships to almost entirely digital distribution for some labels in a span of 4-5 years and many original artists doing global tours; but even selling vinyl + a digi d/l on your Bandcamp alternative is possible and can really help the label/artist recover some of thier costs in production.

Then Liberty X or Bitcoin meetup might be the only way to win him back, seriously; exchanges and atms are the worst way to introduce people to Bitcoin in my opinion. 
I took my friend who is also a systems engineer to a bitcoin meetup and gave him the nerd tour, he seemedoveral satified with our nerd money process; we later went to a mall where HE located the RoboCON ATM only to stand in front of teh machine and show him the stark comparisons of my face-to-face purchase to that of the anal-probe that awaited him when you buy using exchanges and ATMs. 
Or just sell him some of yours and top up your account later. I'm past my evangelist phase, I'm glad to say it was short lived when I think about it, but yeah a bad first experience to anything is hard to undo. 
But, since your dad is programmer he might see this as a challenge/oppotunity and gets on board with a decentralized exchange project, here is the (pre?) alpha I played with the other day that has multisig:

I see an opportunity for Snowden, Applebaum and Assange to come out with an OpSec manual or book; they did well for themselves, and the very people hunted by Global intellegence agencies are like the current gurus of the Cypherpunk, and Cryptoanarchist movement. We should acknowledge that and learn from them. I already have my curtain/bedsheet/jacket method down, Snowden! :)
I think operating on a laptop without a battery/hdd on a liveboot usb running tails and communicating via pgp or other encrypted channels is about the extent of my curreny Opsec starategy. It could obviously use some tightening up, but for my applications its enough, but if they released a book on some how-to's with video support and a forum for Q/A (Lord, knows they have the time these days to check in once a week at least) I'd buy it.

Well, look at this way: you seek the State to intervene and that has a myriad of dire implications for the ecosystem, but will protect your business model; or alternatively you could use your business skills to help accomplish your goals, thus proving you have some practical wherewithall, resiliance and merit as an entrepreneur in an emerging economy. The choice is clear.
You make it sound as though new merchants aren't brought in everyday (directlly or indirectly). This ecosystem is still in 'Bootstrap mode,' nothing about this is turn-key; and if you think you can't make it here without the State ordaining you with its blessing, then quite frankly you don't and likely never belonged here.

Woah, I missed your reply entirely, mate. Sorry. 
Ok, well, you should consider it [because even early adopters are not getting how to run full nodes.](
I still haven't bought my BTC this month, I'm trying to work out this LibertyX thing without having to give too much info, but linking it back to my phone may have to be a compromise I make to try it out. (Kind makes me wish that my burner sim cards from Europe worked here in California.) Which sucks because that is one of the many reasons I dropped Coinbase and pay a premium to buy from meetups. 
Still, let me buy you a beer as soon as I buy from LibertyX; now that I got this pi out of the box I can't stop trying to load things onto it, I tried to get that new tails image to boot since it has electrum on it by default, but so far nothing works.

All that means is you're taking your limited energy and time from 'Buidling,' to argue, often aimlessly and with trolls, with People who have never done anything.
Nothing ends a conversation faster with one of those than to simply ask: what have you built?
Argument, critical evaluation and introspection all have their place, but its often done to such an extreme here and often with no real benefit in this space since 2014 when all the trolls and sockpuppet accounts showed up in masse; Segwit and USAF is a prime example of what happens when we indulge every idiots POV, instead of just letting them try and and subsequently fail at creating a better alternative while we focus on what we sought to do.

Mockery for bad ideas (however bad they may be) is not my personal idea of entertainement, and failures are better sorted by the Free Market with a risk-reward based structure model than some meaningless procession presneted by Marketing-PR's idea of financial titans-gatekeepers in front of a camera.
Reality TV and Crypto is just something that I don't think alligns with Cypherpunk philosphy, despite [Bear Whale's wildest VC ambitions.]( 
Which I personally want to see go down in a ball of flame. Reality TV is the bane of what is already a contrite and perverted form of entertainement which re-enforces (but is not limited to) a great deal of State propaganda, blind consumerism, and perverted social conditioning; we needn't a Jersey Shore like crowd here.

Ponzi is going to Ponzi:
*Investors said they were lured by promises of a HK$1 million return in four months for buying a HK$400,000 bitcoin contract which would produce 90 bitcoins on maturity. Extra profits and prizes such as a Mercedes car or cash prizes would be paid if an investor found more new clients.*
A good idea or investments attracts its customers, and doesn't require the very same customers to lure in others if the business model isn't based on 'the greater fool' premise. 
No remorse given here, that was sheer greed that blinded them, (200%+ RETURNS IN 120 DAYS IN THIS MARKET?! GTFO) not wide-eyed, headlong adoption of a disruptie technology. I mean how the hell do you drop 400k on something you cannot even prove exists, which is the greatest feature of the blockchain: open public ledger with verifiable, and unadultered transaction confirmations.
Hell, I remember hearing about bitcoin in 2010 and I was reluctant dropping something as petty as 10 dollars because I couldn't fathom how I could verify I could get that amount back out and continued to take a passive look until I finally got in 2011 when I saw how a Trustless p2p currency actually functions and the failsafes embedded within it to avoid this in the first place.

They just want their Guilder back, fully controlled and maniplulated by another central bank. Nationalism is the blanket of choice to blind the masses in times of crisis, and they know this.


Agreed. Crypto doesn't need permission to innovate, nor to destroy old paradigms; it must simply be governed by Math and open source protocols for thier user base to review for thier own consideration and purposes.


If it were only that easy. Apparently it takes the decree or vendetta of a Head of State (in the US at least) to even get the ball rolling--and even then its like a vile case of herpes, its only ever dorminant and never truly gone. Only fools believe that these puppets are willing to bite the hand that feeds them. Mario Draghi isn't any different than Bernake, only the names and faces change.

Learn to negotitate? That is what people are supposed to do in Free Markets, remember? I have found people willing to sell to me at stamp prices on a regular basis, but then again they know what my intentions/efforts are in the community, so that helps.


The exception that proves the rule? I'm not sure if you are aware of it, but I'll just leave this here:


I have, and I'm an active donor to Unsystem (although I wish I could give more) and full supporter of what they do for the community, but if you want something to delve into as to why that isn't the smartest thing, start here:
I personally hope they address this, but for now I think that buying from known reputible sources is worth the effort/cost if it maintains my privacy.


Me, too. I spoke to an Argentinian family last night about Bitcoin briefly, and how its being used to hedge against the State's +30% inflation numbers, only to realize that because of where they are from BTC access is not really there for them if they decided to jump in unless they were around Buenos Aires, where I'm told their is quite a bit of support. We need these, just as much as 2.0 related projects; more now then ever.
Conclusion: You have every right as a consumer to use services that are the antithesis of what Bitcoin was intended to do (for now anyway), but please understand that this carries far greater consequences than monetary value.

First, I didn't ask how Bitcoin and by extension its security was anti-fragile, I asked how do you prevent an entity--with much greater resources and a current monopoly on violence--from taking funds from a Bitcoin holder if presented with a great enough threat/harm? 
BItcoin is not anonymous, as we have seen with the last goxxing: we have active Blockchain detectives and hackers that can trace funds quite well, and reserachers in universities have done studies on detecting id's from transactions. It is at best pseudo-anonymous, and even then I have trouble identfiying it like that as I know first hand the hoops you have to go to even maintain that position. (I'm affraid to say that there are too many coins that passed through exchanges/atms to even call it that these days.)
Second, I'm not sure how to respond to that, can you go into a bit more detail of what you mean by coercion via skill and luck?

Rad. I still cannot find anything that won't require I buy from UK or OZ. Awesome work on that [thread]( I will defintely look into this when I find one. 
Do you have any intention of marketing these as a Trezor/Bwallet alternative? I mean you gave the tools to everyone, but perhaps the possibility of a limited run for a few units can be floated? I can handle N. America if you want, so as to reduce overhead, you can take care of OZ, and I have a few friends in Switzerland (one is even a core dev) that can handle Europe.
The extra cash flow can help incentivize pull requests, and updates for developers to include new features. Anyhow, its just a thought; let me know if you are interested and I can start moblizing.

In what sense? I mean the fact that there are so many cryptocurrency related publications now offered on Amazon... that can only be bought for fiat? I mean its cool, sure, but **advancement**, no... I don't think so.
Advancement: would be self-publication on a de-centralized crowd sourcing or direct sales from an author's blog/website using crypto with a global distribution and not worrying about unncessary fees. (Extra nerd points for blockchain proof of existance applcations.)
[Does anyone realize that BItcoin (and some alts) has been available to sale/buy on Ebay (UK) Classifieds for almost a year?]( At the time I thought that would be bigger and trigger so much more adoption (especially since the seller is taking all the risk) but the truth that I have come to realize is that the mainstream is not likely to *get it* just because its now available on their favourite e-commerce website. 
Which is why I think slaving over Amazon and Ebay etc... is a waste of resources as it can already be done using services with nominal fees, which have prices that are far more palatable than to endure continual dissapointment doing the aforementioned.

I'm not a gamer anymore, but when I did I was under the age of being allowed to buy games on the internet or from the back of magazines because I didn't have a CC or personal paypal account. 
I had the fiat, just not the means to do so, and my parents were reluctant to send their CC info to buy so Japanese Pal version (Biohazard: Code Veronica) from a shady ad.
I agree parents are more comfertable letting their kids use their CCs now (but think about all those Sony Hacks) and the world of Online commerce has changed drasticlly, but speaking from experience, I always found it a pain in the ass to convince somoene to buy something for me when I had the cash for it in my hand. 
In my head: I'm sure some 12 year old kid with a paper route or washing dishes and cleaning tables at his family's resteraunt is reading this and agrees with me. How big that demographic is, especially in these stark financial times, is hard to gauge, but I'm sure they are still out there.

They'll make it up as they go, just as they always have when they want to make an example of someone; justice is an illusion--recently Ulbricht vs Jp Morgan outcome illustrated just how apt.

Or you could just relegate these as the rantings of an imbecile and ignore them altogether, like most sane people would and should.
I don't think the community needs a regulator that no one asked for to impose thier will upon us and tell us *how to Bitcoin.* Hell, look at Coinbase or Sherm, they both tried to play their perverse game and still got smacked down. (With various degrees of severity, but similar outcomes.)
Why do you care what these sociopaths and kleptocrats have to say that you warrant to speak on behlaf of the Community? I couldn't give less of a fuck what this corrupt idiot and his ilk are likely to say on the matter. None.

I contributed/paid so that Sean's Outpost decreased Human misery, he in turn fed homeless people in Pensacola; furthermore, through the collective efforts of everyone who felt the same he created and founded Satoshi Forest which has continued to do so as the pictures demonstrate.

I have worked for a non-profit that helps people with mental disabilties in one of the poorest states in the US (Hawaii), and even with us having our paperwork in 'order' and having a 501c we still suffer accounting losses due to mishaps with petty cash, and my time anytime when we made purchases; furthermore, we lose about 100 times that with burecratic BS for our projects because of our status, so much so it actually jeporadized the solvency of our organization.

If you consider that advertising that you accept BTC will initially be a Marketing cost, than sure; all restaurants lose money on a daily basis, whether it be unsatisfied customers, dine-dash, to waiters/cooks fucking up an order and comping the meal, CC chargebacks,, to just treating your daily customers to a bottle of wine or an off the menu entree or desert etc... 
The goal is to contain these loses as best you can while maximizing profits; if you think this will in turn generate further interest and increase your market share, than yes, totally worth it. 
Personally, having worked in both fintech and in culinary I'd rather wait for Square to get something rolled out if my aim was to serve the non-tech savvy customer, if I'm targeting the more savvy clientele than I'd set up a casa node and LN wallet and roll the dice and see where the chips fall after 6-12 months.  
Doublespends, while possible, are less than a threat than most make it out to be; my bigger concern is not having the properly trained staff and making the BTC tx a bigger pita than it needs to be and making others indifferent or reluctant to do so because of said difficulty. But if the goal is to fund a LN channel, and that is kind of an interesting way of doing it, why not just buy the BTC outright?

I brought this issue up to Vitalik last year, hoping that smart contracts would be able to mitigate the dire situation in Colorado (even back then it was clear operation chokepoint would target Colorado growers/businesses.) I never heard back, and now that we see most 2.0 projects remianing stagnant (and litterly no where despite sitting on tons of funds) I'm kind of glad they didn't address as it could of tarnished how and why Crypto circumvents about 90% of the problems--Local/State/Federal taxes are the only issue(s) that cannot be addressed, at this time. Albeit in a tiresome and convulted manner.
Can someone get me in a room with Draper? Or anyone else with VC funds in California that want to get a payment systems solution sorted out for Colorado's massive, and ever growing, cannabis economy? (THC cannabis products are the low hanging fruit, Colorado cannot compete with NorCal or BC in scale or in quality; so farmers are looking to target more Value Added Product Markets: think Pharma scale of revenue.)
I'm back in California and what I had suggested to Vitalik was a skeleton framework of a working solution that I couldn't implement, due to lack of resoruces and time, despite being acutely aware of the situation in Colorado--I'm a Biodynamic farmer who uses cannabis in my cultivation of my cultures and my land is in Colorado.
Crypto plays a big part of why I got involved in this industry, and is a culmination of all my greatest strengths.

What's odd is how despite that looming over most multi-nationals in China, they still flock there; as if the PRC openly stealing IP and ignoring copyright stuff (not really a concern for me personally) wasn't bad enough, but entering a Market solely for greater market share blinds them to the obvious peril of being nationalized by the PRC.
This constant seeking for growth at all costs is what leads to such myopic environmental and Geo-political issues and a constant reminder why, while being an anarcho-capitalist, I still think Capitalism itself is inherently flawed, especially so as long as the State exists.
Tesla is a funny example, they open-sourced all their patents \[1\], and want to captivate the fastest EV market without being hindered by the geopolitics/costs and the logistical nightmare of being solely CA based for production, which makes practical sense; but Xi Jinping showing up one day saying 'this is mine now, round eye' is a real possibility.

Seamless Stealth address transactions inside of a multi-crypto currency wallet/app to receieve and transfer funds: ideally with BTC and Darkcoin compatability. 
That way a more robust 'mixing' solution is also covered if one is so inclined. (I think I may be describing Darkwallet with Darkcoin intergration, still, competetion is good and I'd like to see it happen if possible.) And it could get over the 10 minute delay if quick tx times are needed as Darkcoin is near instant since they use the masternode.

WTF is this?
Since when does a car manufacture require a crypto currency to build an automated manufacturing assembly line? The short answer is: never. In fact, most manufactures have been entirely reluctant on even utilizing IBM's enterprise platform (hyperledger) for their uses. A forward thinking company like Tesla uses its own in-house system (WARP) and so much is built around that system that it would be entirely impossible to even consider it. I can't seen how an antiquated corp like Toyota/Nissan/BMW type company would even consider it, either.

I'll add fast settlement times, or instant in LN case, and no client-side hacks, this is probably a bigger concern than most care to deal with as they have never dealt with (big) retailer scale data; its immense what they are held liable for.
And this changes even more if you go the EU, or are a country entering the EU zone as I saw that HR in '13, its insane how much resources are necessary to maintain those records. (I have a cool pic of an effigy of the tax-man 'fisco' being strung up KKK style from a tree in the town square when I first moved there and worked and saw the transition.)
Many of which are just kept in paper and require a Human to analyze.  Germany was the worse that I saw.
With that being said, I played with NFC payments with crypto earlier than most (late 2016) and I can say its totally blase, its nothing remarkable as that is not what this tech is meant for.
 But, I'm willing to give it another go provided the terms and conditions for the app lets me use and transfer my funds as I wish, and this whole Winklevoss bucks thing is fucking absurd. I'm not going to say these guys don't deserve their success, but I'm staunchly against things like tether or anything like it. 
I used most of these same exact merchants back then, too, namely: Starbucks, Natural grocers, Rite Aid, and McDonalds. 
Personally, I'd like to see those Casa Nodes or HTC phones with LN enabled as the new standard for people playing with this tech; using a 3rd party is pointless, and having been one myself: its time for that to change.

I'm a big fan of Szabo, but, no... You need someone like Andreas to give insightful analogies and relatable terms and perspectives to engage the Rogan demographic. An immensely analytical mind such as Szabo would be like Ronda Patrick (who, as a fellow Bio-nerd, I think does an amazing job of doing what Andreas to relate to the audience about Biochemistry and Health Science) but on steroids. Look at all his talks on Smart Contracts.
[Though I'd personally love this OG cypherpunk to talk about crypto and its importance from this narrative]( on a massive platform. Watch all [10 parts here.](
It would be interesting, but not really effective at doing much more than confusing people or turning them off even more about fake-internet-nerd money; they'll get there eventually if they get in the first place and learn at their own place. Personal anecdote:  I was on BTF when Hal was around and still posting. I saw and read some of his posts, but it was way over my head back in late '11-13, it wasn't until late '13 or so that I finally got a grasp of what he was doing or talking about in most of his posts.
Honestly, I'd like to see Andreas and (and a now more media-polished) Elizabeth Stark try to take on LN and the current 'state of the art' and get the next slot for 3 hours with Rogan. If she gets too advanced, Andreas would be there to reiterate what was said in a more simplified manner if it seemingly goes over their head(s), which to me is what he excels at most.


I'm only 50 mins, I have to rest now, but that doesn't seem like the case so far to me; he may be pointing out ETH's smart contract and steam framework for comparison sake, but he seems to be advocating for a decentralized approach to  solving problems that are currently being addressed at the Nation-State level. Its been philosophically interesting so far, with what he has admitted to being a anarcho-socialist bend and some transhumanist ideals mixed in there, but I haven't seen any of that obvious Vitalik worship that blindly negates the fact that ETH is in fact a centralized system with buggy, complex language with massive exploits and forks in its recent past.

These people have clearly lost their sense of self-preserverence and survival instincts that make Humans: Human. 
But as I said, with albeit a small amount of context, *political solutions* are not a viable means to our desired end, because even when they do arrive to a somewhat favourable end (not desired) it often comes at too great a cost: War, treachery, deciet and continued Human misery. 
Only to ultimately  find out that what you initially fought against was what you have become and exalted thorugh the tyranny of a 'politcal system.' It is for this reason that the phrase 'History is writen by the Winners' is so damn stark.

You must have missed this part: Silver is not an investment tool, its an instrument for wealth preservation. Most noticeably accrued by so-called 'premiums' when dealing with liquidations or trades of physical silver.
Granted, it is a commodity sought out by Global manufacturing industries, but if you see its valuation in respect to its spot/paper price you will know its way too volatile to be considered a worthwhile investment tool. And even with that demand of these industries' usage, chances of you negotiating prices with Samsung for your holdings is null and void, so the only true Market forces that make your holdings increase in nominal terms (as an investment does) is an increase/push in paper price if/when you sell--assuming of course we are dealing in a scenario without JP Morgan et al manipulation. 
What I am saying is that by purchasing silver you withdrew yourself from a known depreciating asset: fiat currency. And took silver in exchange of this asset for a set price. In doing so you have taken a step that helps in at least recovering your initial purchase price when selling this physical silver; its valuation can be determined by the buyer by a series of criteria that exceeds its denoted paper price in addition to other relevant premiums; numismatics are perhaps the best example of this, they possess certain attributes that are not reflected on silver's paper/spot price. One referencing the paper price alone would make the false assumption that: 1 ounce of silver is 1 ounce of silver. 
When in fact the truth is that the Market labors under the belief that 'not all silver is equal.' The market forces are such that something even as seemingly 'insignificant' as the shape of your silver can drastically alter the price: rounds vs bars. And an ETF (what the spot price is actually reflecting) is not the same as a Silver Eagle.

Why is this being attributed to a person who's very existence would later go on to subvert and perverse Global commerce and international relations? OP, Have you ever heard of the Ford Foundation? And just how detrimental this has been on the World?
Second, it was Andrew Jackson who is believed to have said that after discussing the matters of the 2nd Central Bank of the US, a statement which he would later make good on: 
*Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out... If people only understood the rank injustice of the money and banking system, there would be a revolution by morning.*
Jackson was a staunch hard-money man, but for some reason despite that I still think he would have some interest in bitcoin as a means of decentralized monetary systems given what he would do with the latter part of his life; he was also a child-soldier in the US Revolution so chances are his position of 'taxation without representation' would be in line with the ethos of Bitcoin.

Does anyone remember [PunchMe]( 
Back then we had forum/gang wars blow up from all over the web, and people were actually putting upwards of $15 each to upgrade their armor or to buy guns and troll rival chans/forums/hackers/clans/Myspace/FB like groups etc... Entire forums raised cash for group armaments prior to raiding a group in some cases. I think the craziest one that trolled me was a fucking vintage soda bottle collection forum!
Suffice it to say: [this shit went viral]( (If you were smart you knew how to cash in and hack the thing.)
I always thought that with the way people have developed an almost tribe mentality amongst forums/FB groups and how ubiqitous wifi has gotten since 2006, plus smartphone boom a BTC game like that where you held or stole micro amounts of BTC would really take off.
I remember having some kid from fucking Estonia asking me to sale in game items to him and he'd pay me over paypal. I gave it to him, and thought nothing of it when he didn't pay right away and considered it a loss, only to see that 3 weeks later the money cleared. It was like 8 dollars, after fees, which if I recall was quite a lot for those guys at the time. 
I will just say this: test your code for vulnerabilities, and exploits because if this gains traction and you aren't making any money, someone else will.
Edit: **Man we used to troll guys hard and break their forum's chain of command and trust with this game, I forgot what a nerd I was back then and how fun I thought shit like this was: all for the lulz:**

i lost my whole bank account in 3 rounds of 50/50. which was a total of 2.6 million in 3 rounds. then i figured id take the gang funds seeing as i lost 3 in a row, i could win this one for sure and donate 75% of my winnings to the gang which woulda left us sitting pretty at 5 mil or so. but no, i lost that. it was blair that prolly won it. so then i sold my house, put up the 5 mil. lost that. now i was starting to get pissed losing 5 times in a row. who the **** is that 50/50? so then i sell my bazooka put up that money and lost too. from then i realized that the games fuking rigged so im quitting and selling my account.

Having done many speaking engagements, you will have a bad one at some point; but don't let it deter you, if you're passionate about it you'll get better and deliver stronger more concise points with experience. I was overwhelming people with detail and nuance that I lost them 10 mins in because I thought I was talking to Cryptonerds on BTF or something...
I personally was no stranger to public speaking when i first started doing conferences and panels, and I bombed a few times due to technical difficulties or poor setup/sound etc... but I got better, its just part of the process, no one just gets up there and woos a crowd in their first go, either.

For 5k BTC, we can do much better, while expanding its user-base; an escrow held sovereign wealth fund that invests like Y-combinator investment platform for start-ups is a far superior plan. In fact I had discussion with another person yesterday, I'm looking over my notes and may post this at a later time for further refinement. 
*Bitcoin doesn't need to be advertised. Don't treat it like a pyramid scheme. It needs slow steady adoption.*
Agreed, commerce and business oriented growth is the most viable and honestly the most needed form of growth. Short-time flippers, flavor-of-the-month types in it for the quick buck are only going to increase volatility, not aid in its stability. Where as merchants or starts up will invest not only on the pertinent equipment for bitcoin, make bitcoin denominated transactions, but also make purchases in bitcoin as more suppliers enter the arena.

For someone who is so fixated on the idea that 'they are just following the chain of command,' you are equally so quick to dismiss the statements made by the very 'brass' that 'call the shots.' At best your premise is that of scapegoating.
Your entire 'argument' of perceived recourse relies on that, and yet you have proven how fickle your position is when asked to defend it. You failed to provide any evidence of your prior claims; so, please, do us both a favor and try to follow some line of intelligible coherence when you argue. Or at the very least refrain from such antics, if you are incapable of doing so. 
I think I have made my point, however, I take some solace in knowing it hasn't entirely fallen on deaf ears. But the fact that this post has more up-votes than Sean's Outpost receiving the generous contribution from the ESPN Sign Guy is sobering, if not downright chilling.

I defy you to get accurate accounting of US military expenditures when procuring actual Pentagon/CIA/NSA operational costs to refute this claim is a fruitless endeavor, and is so deeply shrouded that one cannot in any coherent manner make such a claim; yet one fact remains: this expenditure has grown to such an extent that even the US Generals are claiming it be the greatest threat to US 'National security.'
Yeah, hysterical; I mean we are only using 'fake internet' money to revolt against Banking cartels, Corrupt Governments... such a statement is so ill-placed isn't?
Clearly not enough to undermine the damage it creates, if we are believe former CIA directors.
Which in its aftermath has destabilised regions where trade once took place (Libya, Somalia, Egypt, Iran just to name a few in the last decade) but these, just as so many others, can be undone with low-intensity conflicts that ensures that the Military Industrial Complex and Oil Industry report greater and greater earnings year after year. And they use the expendable serfs, financed by the debt peonage's 'wealth' to achieve it. Guess who protects Shell, BP, and Exxon Mobil? Why is the US subsidizing the trade routes for Private corporations? 
Right, are we taking into consideration the current economic landscape in the US where procuring resources for bombs/armaments, subsidized by the oppressed debt peonage in the US via taxation or inflation, is given greater priority than actual wealth producing services and industries? Why are most chemists, engineers, biologists, and mathematicians employment opportunities with the US government/military? For those with even a semblance of ethics or morals one is compelled to withdraw from this farce which often means grave sacrifices to quality of life; in short, employment opportunities in the US for the most critical 'higher educated' brackets in the last decade ensures that you either kill for the government and or aid fomenting further misery or remain in poverty; the few scrupulous among us take our chances with the latter while belonging and supporting communities such as these to ensure we can undo what was forcefully inflicted upon us.
Self responsibility? For an entity (the State) that violates the US Constitution—that funny thing both politicians and military alike swore to protect with their very Life—and has undermined with outright scorn for over 60 years when it comes to Military intervention firmly in mind, I'd say only a Statist apologist can actually expect such a painfully absurd claim to hold any validity. I cannot attribute any more responsibility to the Military as I can to any other congenital disease; for both are scourges on mind, body and soul.

You are committing the fallacy of someone who I would never consider a 'silverbug,' that is that you are deriving the value of actual physical price to that of the paper price.
Silver has its place in the World, just as Bitcoin does. Silver is not an investment tool, or at least not a very good one; if you have never heard of bitcoin the volatility of it in just the past 10 years would make most choke and look elsewhere.
Silver is an instrument of wealth preservation, and the paper price has little to no meaning unless you have to liquidate immediately to a seller/demographic who does not understand the distinction. I'll assume you know it's history in commerce and in industry.

What I don't understand is why this is continues to be portrayed as an either-or position; what possible purpose is there in touting one to be 'superior' to another instead of simply coherently presenting and highlighting bitcoins attributes, both negative and positive, in respect to Gold to the audience?
This whole 'my asset class is more respected/has more clout than yours' nonsense has to end.

If I can make wallets for them and show the particular aspects in real time (instant deposits and withdraws) this would surely go a long way to encourage adoption. This part of Europe has 2 businesses that accept bitcioin, I'd like to increase that but my coinbase account still shows another 5 days for it to clear. 
Credit card has still not hit a critical mass here, and so anyone eager to adopt it may be inclined to hear what bitcoin has to offer.

Here are my experiences in various European countries EU/Non:
Germany: Aside from Berlin (Northern Germany) there is virtually no one talking about it in the far wealthier South, even during Cyprus, the whole 'where would they be if they saved or paid their taxes' occurred; there is a small minority in agriculture that have taken an interest when I spoke about it, but it is seldom followed up on. Hardly anyone I ever spoke to have asked for greater details.
They seem interested in crowdfunding, so perhaps this can segue into that with the adoption if bitcoin by a few of the crowdfunding guys.
Italy: Too many other problems encumber any real growth: Berlusconi's circus keep the eyes fixed in the older and often more affluent levels, while the youth are fleeing the country to find employment elsewhere, so it seems that little to no disposable income can be sourced for investment.
Croatia: Prior to entering the EU many came out in support of maintaining their sovereignty as a young nation, still tattered by the war with Serbia, some are receptive to what bitcoin can offer. But just as in Italy very few have any real disposable income, a majority of the population live hand to mouth, and seldom have work outside the peak tourist months. Many are fleeing the country to Sweden or any where else.
Despite that I think I heard of an exchange setup in Zagreb and some guys are listed on localbitcoins with reviews, they are asking absurd premiums (even above gox!) with relatively high minimum purchases, this sadly has left many unable to enter, should they even have the slightest amount of curiosity. 
The few that have heard it are only repeating the tired soundbites given to them by TV and the radio: Dread and silkroad being the way to get people 'whacked' and getting drugs online. 
Oh, and a villa or 2 in Dalmatia take bitcoin, so like I said they are ready for adoption; they just need to be convinced it is in their interest. 
Switzerland: Perhaps the most affluent nation in Europe per capita, the truth is things are very slow there; but the youth are eager to learn and are capable of taking greater risks due to higher salaries they earn, but living expenses being what they are, it is still relatively difficult. The older crowds are not even remotely interested, they live in relative 'opulence' in comparison to the rest of the crumbling EU so they are just 'savoring the moment,' so to speak. I don't blame them, because so many have worked so hard to get there, and after all the years of laboring they deserve to enjoy what they have earned. 
That being said, Switzerland is the country who I find most capable of making the biggest impact in Europe, and not just because of the wages and relative economic stability; but rather because their youth are going to need it in such an inverted wealth paradigm. They are deluding themselves if they think the franc and Swiss economy will not be affected by the failure of the Dollar or Euro. These two currencies represent their largest trade partners. 
Austria: Not much can be said, I didn't spend enough time to ascertain and accurately gauge it.
Hungary: So many other problems.
Slovenia: Same as Hungary.

This seriously cannot be overstated, I think this is what divides us from most other 'commodity' traders, a large part of us are actually invested in doing more than just flipping coins' for a quick profit; we are driven to prove to skeptical onlookers that we can in fact make a difference in our local economy which in turn advances our local communities, but it cannot be overlooked that with greater profits and returns we also scour our hearts and souls and are convinced that charities like Sean's Outpost is what our collective efforts as a community take greatest pride in.

Are we specifically talking about Lindt chocolate or artisan stuff from say Vaud or Geneva with certification papers (as I have done both) when you say dark chocolate? I think the highest purity I have come across was 65-70% and that stuff is just too bitter for me, but I know a Market exists. Maybe if I bend someones ear I can get the template/mould via 3d printer to streamline the process.
With Christmas season a lot of seasonal products have showed up, my favorite being Williams Schnapps in the center of 25% dark chocolate; its a funny albeit it VERY tasty combination. 
Let me know if you want to make this happen.

*Fawkesy is famous in Bitcoin community because she is simply a girl...*
Or because of her conviction and her efforts towards Sean's Outpost... 
*It is a skockingly skewed demographic, even compared to the average reddit*
Perhaps, and I won't deny the numbers are (perceived to be) heavily biased towards one side, I merely pointed out that they do exist; but my point being is that it doesn't matter, adoption and usage is what matters. 
However, you could postulate some theory about BTC in China being heavily female biased because its 'housewives' that control the purse strings, and given the volume difference in comparison to the US or Europe: BTC is an actuality dominated by women. Its all academic, and an equally wasteful use of time.

Local bitcoins, but it comes at a premium (GOX + X% depnding on your location); I'd stick with Coinbase and maybe posting on R/coinbase if it falters to get white listed.
But if it is of any consolation my last 2 purchases have been seamless; my first was the slowest, always is, but the the following instant buy was there within 15 mins. These were during high volume periods, too. 
Also, if you decide to go with Coinbase, disable API before your purchase, and learn to store in cold wallets. 
I'm feeling positive over the 30cd, and I'm considering setting up a localbitcoin account specifically to help you out since I have instant buy, PM me an offer for services rendered and lets see what we can do.
