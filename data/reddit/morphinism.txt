Bitcoin is the new hotness. A lot of people want exposure to it or negative exposure to it. The bank's job is to make financial products that it's clients want. Futures are a well-known way of doing that without having to deal with the difficult realities that come with getting involved in the underlying directly. 
The futures market and the spot market influence each other via a storage arbitrage relationship.

More rigorously said, a price of zero is an unstable equilibrium.

Gold has industrial uses in electronics. It's not a large fraction of total gold production.

The question is, as returns begin to slope off (and they will, eventually) will people break ranks and start selling to capture profits? What about when returns turn negative? I can't imagine the feeling when you've literally bet the house and are starting at a position that's down 20%, 50%... 80%. The sweat, the elevated pulse, the self-blame, and finally... the despair.

Well, either he knows something that no one else participating in the ripple market knows or it's a completely unfounded proposition. Which do you think it is?

This hypothesis based upon market capitalization and the false equivalence of gold and bitcoin, is completely and utterly unfounded. These are two distinct commodities with their own properties and their own market structures. The prices for each are determined by the market for each and they are completely uncorrelated. 
Seeing this kind of terrible analysis gain traction makes me bearish on bitcoin: If these sorts of statements are indicative of the average bull's intelligence, then I'm more than willing to take the other end of the trade.
But there are other reasons to be bearish at this point. Let's take the game theoretics for the largest holders of bitcoin today, the so-called "whales." If they collude, they can restrict supply so as to put upwards pressure on the price. However, at this point they've already seen astronomical returns on their holdings, and once the first one defects, even to just diversify into other asset classes -- an intelligent move for 7+ figure bitcoin position -- well... I think you can guess what will happen.

I doubt that there will be substantially new innovations in cryptocurrency, that is, ones that are on par with the invention of bitcoin. If you want to make early-investor-in-bitcoin money, you should look outside the space.

Similar except that bitcoin futures are all cash settled. Agricultural futures are typically settled with the underlying good. This makes the BTC contracts more like stock index futures like ES or those for non-deliverable currencies.

Two parties agreed to pay each other, in cash, the difference between the index price of bitcoin (as determined in the details of the futures contract) and 16,800. If the difference is 0, no money changes hands. If it's positive (index rose) the seller pays the buyer. If it's negative (index fell), the buyer pays the seller. There is no BTC involved; the price of bitcoin is just something to look at to determine who pays whom how much.

Nope. Not even close. It's mainstream. Snoop the conversations happening in the restaurants and bars of any major city and I guarantee you'll hear people of questionable intelligence discussing the magic internet money.

So... How exactly does gold work as a hedge against bitcoin? Don't the things you are hedging have to be anti-correlated with the things you are hedging with? Instead of reducing your exposure to bitcoin, wouldn't adding gold to your portfolio just... give you gold exposure?
Perhaps I have a different notion of what it means to hedge. I would say instead you that you have diversified -- somewhat -- by buying gold.

Something else I forgot to mention: futures are pretty useful when you are a producer (i.e. miner) since you can lock in a price now instead of being subjected to the whims of the market later.

I liked the idea of holding gold until I looked at how much I would have to pay in storage fees for a questionable and unreliable return.

The equilibrium of that game isn't what you think it is.
