I like gold and silver but it's hard to prioritize when btc triples and they do nothing. They literally just lie there and doesn't even multiply, not even a little bit.

Why are people mining on bitcoin.com to begin with?!

What's wrong with tulips? Everybody loves flowers. The tulip production reached maturity, it just had a bad time in its infancy.

No there's no wallet, or similar in Swedish. It's the English word "wallet". That word was physical only or primarily in English once as well. This is just them showing how international and indifferent to their home they are.
No wallet also means no privkeys, obviously.

"Wallet" and not plånbok. I hate these people.

Spain is inherited by history for some human beings. What is your relationship to your mother? There are no contracts. The relationship was there before any agreement. Therefore the relationship doesn't exist *tips fedora*.

Voluntarily putting ads on your car for free for some far fetched benefit. It's a bit tacky.
