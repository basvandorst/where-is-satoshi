Wow thanks for all the replies!! I considered leasing a car but there's still that down-payment.
My only concern is if bitcoin hits $40,000 within a month, then yeah I probably should have HODL'd. But I think a $2000 loss in profit is worth the convenience of a car.
The fact that 80% of people I mention Bitcoin to have no idea what it is, tells me that it is not too late to buy in.
My savings account has a 6% APY. Right now bitcoin has about a 6% DPY (daily percentage yield). I'm done selling drugs -- I am working my butt off and saving all my money into Bitcoin!

Thanks!! Here's a pic
She gets from point a to point b. I'm guessing I have about 1 more car to buy before it becomes completely illegal for humans to drive and we're all cruising around in autonomous vehicles. :]

It's kinda clicking but I guess I haven't thought about Bitcoin enough or something.
Is it kinda like how I used to buy entire Bitcoins for $450 and immediately send them straight to China for questionable goods? Like that's what you'd do if BTC didn't have a future?
So what you're saying is it's good to buy entire Ben Franklins (if you need to), and *immediately* send them straight to whoever is only accepting that form of currency?
In other words, don't just sell just to sell and hold on to USD. Spend, not sell. Am I kinda getting it? Highly appreciate everyone's wisdom, o great members! Hail Magic Internet Money!!!

Holy crap. Why is this not more obvious...? I sincerely never thought of that.
I guess because I assumed that no one is stupid enough to day trade... people actually do that?

I'm so confused. Sorry, I'm stupid.
The best I can get from what you're saying is that I should have taken out a loan instead?
Honestly, I would have loved to, but I really messed up when I was younger and all I have is a couple maxed out credit cards (I pay them off each month but max them right back out again). I know, I probably visit more often...

I haven't drove in so long, the insurance companies have forgiven my reckless driving history of my younger age, and gave me cheap rates!
Oh wait I don't think that's what you meant. Insurance? Hedging? Idk I just mined some altcoins with Google Cloud and traded them for Bitcoin.
Would appreciate an elaboration &lt;3
