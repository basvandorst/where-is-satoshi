How do you think they'll outlaw it? You realize the private key is really just a very large number? Outlaw numbers? Network protocols too? Outlaw TCP/IP while you're at it.

It seems like a super shady place. People wanting to get rid of their Amazon gift cards at a 30% discount? Right, and pigs can fly too. Plus, Ver is an investor in the company AFAIK and they're bcash friendly which should surprise nobody given how shady all of it is.

I suppose you could compile bitcoind for iOS, with a bit of work. You could sign it with your dev certificate and deploy it. The problem with that is that it would have to be resigned once a year and also that it would only run if in foreground. Apple doesn’t allow long running 3rd party services on iOS.
I definitely trust Apple more than Google when it comes to privacy but iOS just isn’t very hacker friendly unfortunately.
Are you looking to repurpose your old iPhone? It’s probably a lot easier to just get an RPi.

I paid 500 sats yesterday ($0.05). The wallet software suggested 12 sats/byte. I overrode it down to 1 sat/byte. It got picked up in the next block, no problem. 
The fee estimation of most wallets is just crap. Check out the mempool before posting the transition. If it's empty, like now, or if you're not in a hurry, pick 1 sat/byte.

When was that 6 block reorg to double spend $10K, if you don’t mind me asking? These days, it’s super rare to see even a 2 block reorg (happens about once a year or so).
Six confirmations is plenty safe, unless you’re moving extremely large amounts.
I only have the history since 2017 but it would be nice to have the complete reorg history.
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:01:44
Imagine you're running an exchange and someone deposited $100 million. Someone  with that much money might be able to rent enough hash power to attempt to double spend. You definitely want to wait for a couple of confirmations, just to be safe. Nobody depositing $1 will invest any hash power to double spend.
Realistically though, it's highly unlikely any one party, no matter how powerful, would be able to muster enough hash power to do something like that on Bitcoin. It happens all the time on smaller shitcoins though.

Correct me if I'm wrong but a 51% attack can't cause double-spends or prevent transactions from being processed. All 51% attack can do is cause a in fork the chain if they attempt to insert bum transactions (double spends or spend of coin that doesn't belong to them) or slow down the processing of transactions they don't like (they can't stop them until they have 100% hash power).

Just like the article states, there's nothing in that capture that proves the post was made in 2008. In fact, it's extremely unlikely that both google and archive would have missed it for 7+ years.

You could run the pruned blockchain although you wouldn't have the complete history. It's not as useful but it would cut down the disk requirements substantially.
I didn't see the rush when I synced mine. It took my RPi class node with a rotational disk 9 days. No big deal. It keeps up with the network just fine, under 10% CPU usage. It helps a lot to boost the in-memory cache size. An SSD would probably sync in less than a day if you go that route. My desktop machine syncs in a couple of hours for example.

Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) on the other hand? I don't think he ever wrote a line of code or saw a shitcoin he wouldn't shill.

80%+ of that hash power is controlled by a federated group of bcash actors: Ver (bitcoindotcom), Bitmain (btc.com, antpool) and their underlings (via, btc.top). They're not going to attack the network they wholly own.
The danger to bcash is from using the same algo as Bitcoin (SHA256) and having less than 5% of the hash power of Bitcoin. Even a smaller Bitcoin pool (or even Ayre/BSV) can 51% attack bcash, not that it's a very good idea to do that. Also bear in mind that if someone 51% attacked bcash, Ver and Bitmain would move hash power from Bitcoin to bcash to protect it. They did just that when BSV threatened to attack, just after their BAB/BSV split.
