I would too, ever since BCH was made it's been so much drama. It seems the currency cannot exist without putting the original down.

They just want more money, that's it. This is all a scheme to guilt people into disabling adblock. I think online ads need to all be jpg images, it should be illegal to have sound in TV commercials, and radio commercials need to have their volume lowered to that of the rest of the programming or just spoken by one of the DJs. Stop all the screaming and crap to pull our attention away from what were doing. It's just annoying, if anything I have stopped using products with annoying ads.

Yep, I literally sat there one day and watched a java ad try to crash or overflow my browser and install a virus to my computer. I've never felt bad about blocking ads after that.

I believe adblock now only blocks what they describe as "annoying ads". I can confirm this because i'm running adblock and see a nice flat jpg ad in the side of my page for Home Depot right now. So instead of asking for money, or for people to disable adblock why not just make ads that are not annoying hmmm??
I have seen ads with java viruses so you are also besides asking for money asking people to make themselves more susceptible to viruses for the sake of your precious ads.

I use rdp to a home computer and break out the on screen keyboard with a software wallet that's saved on Google drive. I'm pretty happy with that.
