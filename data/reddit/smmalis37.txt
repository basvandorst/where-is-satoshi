White line courtesy of me in mspaint. However there is a pretty strong hitorical trend of following this line other than occasional bubbles and corrections back to it. Is that happening right now? Let's wait and see!

I don't think it'll necessarily be that long (especially not at the current rate we're falling) but I do think it'll go back down to the white line sooner or later, rise steadily for a while, then bubble and correct back to the line again, and repeat.

*For now.
A big part of their decision was to "wait and see", which I find perfectly reasonable.

This is likely related to the ongoing phishing/sybil attack against electrum users. It's currently unknown who's behind it.
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:26:46
No. The purpose of these attacks is to get you to manually install a fake version of the electrum wallet, which would then steal all of your coins. As long as you only install official versions downloaded from  you'll be fine.
@_date: 2019-03-26 15:02:30
As far as I can tell that's exactly it, yes.

Will do if I ever decide to stop hodling.


Uptime is 24/7 except when i reboot due to updates, or if the internet/power goes down. Static IP isn't possible unfortunately, ISP doesn't offer it. However, it hasn't changed in weeks, so hopefully it won't change too often.


Already done.


Interesting, I was not aware of the integration offered here, I'll look into it.
@_date: 2019-03-26 06:49:46
I enjoy being helpful to the community at large. If this is the price to pay, so be it. My server's still completely accessible despite the attack, just a little slower to respond.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:38:56
That's a good one, thanks. I assume any value above 1000000 would be pointless until the eventual hard fork, correct?
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:19:53
It's running on Arch linux...
@_date: 2019-02-03 10:45:39
There's lots of ways to defend against this attack, but most if not all of them are more complicated than "doing nothing", which is why the attack works.
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:38:57
Yeah, I meant that the "update" has to be manually installed. I reworded things to be a little clearer.
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:26:46
Makes me glad I'm running my own server.
My understanding of the issue here: If you run Electrum and don't specify a server to connect to, it'll pick one at random. If some attacker spins up 10000 AWS/Azure/whatever server instances, they can get a ton of clients to connect to them. These servers don't get blacklisted or anything because they are functioning normally: serving data and forwarding transactions for their clients. However, they do one extra thing normal servers don't. Apparently the Electrum protocol allows servers to send messages to the clients, so the attacker abuses this functionality to direct clients to a fake "update".  Once the user manually downloads and installs the "update" and they unlock their wallet it just sends all their coins away instantly.
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:55:42
Eh, there's lots of blame to go around here. The attackers, obviously, for being dicks and stealing people's money, the developers for writing a feature to display arbitrary rich text from an untrusted source, the users for falling for the phish, not verifying their downloads, or staying up-to-date...
As a software developer myself I hope the community can view this as a learning experience. Just because a feature may be useful in some cases doesn't mean it can't also be abused, or be worthwhile overall. One trend I've noticed in the Bitcoin community as a whole is that so so often the users get all the blame when things go wrong, but that overlooks our role as experts to make things as easy as possible for the rest of the world. We can't simply expect that every Bitcoin user in the world will check every day. We have to do better. Users will almost always take the path of least resistance, and nothing we do will change that. The only thing we can do is make the path of least resistance the right one (see also the concept of the "pit of success").

Agreed. Which is why it's still a proposal being heavily debated so that when/if it is eventually implemented it can be done so as safely as possible.

Welcome to the full node club! I'm looking at guides to setting up an LN node on top of mine as well. One other thing you could look into is running an electrumx server to support electrum users. All depends on how much cpu/hd space/RAM/bandwidth you've got though.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:06:54
Yeah, I know I have to make a systemd service to take care of shutdown properly. What advantages would c-lightning have over the others?
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:04:23
Agreed. I see no reason to provide a separate no-bcash package since electrum will only work with whichever coin you configure it to use. The default config file I provide is set to bitcoin-segwit, but I don't see any reason to remove support for something else, regardless of how I feel about it personally.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:48:05
Sometime soon, probably this weekend, I'm gonna set up a lightning node on top of my full node, throw a full coin at it, and let it sit on autopilot.
To people with more knowledge than me: What are the risks if the server running the node reboots occasionally (say at worst once a day, but probably more like once a week)? I know there's the risk of losing funds if my channel partner tries to screw me while i'm offline, but if I come online right after that the software should notice and be fine right?
Also, which implementation should I go with? Lnd? Eclair? Something else?
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:44:07
Could you elaborate on the attack vectors and the pseudo-decentralization of ETH? I know very little about it.

Also if we ever get to the point where 1 satoshi is too valuable the precision can be increased (although I think it would need a hard fork?)

If you manually enter the url can you connect and sync?
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:10:39
Yep, I can connect to it fine by manually entering the hostname or ip myself. Just doesn't show up on the list automatically.
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:27:01
Do you mean in the .conf? I don't have anything specific set, I thought it would generate a reasonable default.
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:34:16
Including both, and I support both.
@_date: 2015-10-18 01:25:00
I had the same issue a year ago. Turns out the issue was my ram was failing. About a month later random crashes started happening and I figured it out. Try running a memtest?
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:15:10
Additionally does anyone know if there's some extra configuration needed to make my server show up in people's lists in the client? Mine doesn't show up in the list on my phone.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:09:34
You need to point it at an indexing bitcoin node, which is what handles downloading the blockchain. I'm running one on the same machine, and it's what's using most of the storage:
134G    /data/bitcoin
22G     /data/electrumx
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:22:32
 is able to see me, so they seem to be.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:52:18
Just started running my own electrumx server 3 weeks ago, so far so good. And it's public so I'm helping out the rest of the network. Feels good. Gets data from the UASF node on the same box I was already running. I'm at orannis.ddns.net for anyone who wants to connect. Just don't DOS me or anything please.
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:38:36
I have IRC = yes and REPORT_HOST = orannis.ddns.net set in my .conf, would I need anything else?
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:43:41
Not too heavy, it's a nuc, but it seems to be handling it fine so far. If it gets too taxing then I'll kill it, but I hope it won't come to that.
Here's my conf, see anything I'm missing? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:31:02
It's showing up on my list now, apparently it just needed time to propagate or something. Does it show up for you too?
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:13:47
Greatly appreciated! Hopefully I can actually get this all working.
@_date: 2018-12-24 04:58:05
I'm curious which node implementation you're running? Also curious if you're using some form of autopilot, or opened your channels manually?
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:32:31
Good plan. This is all running on a box sitting under my desk with a 2TB hdd in it, seems to be working well.
