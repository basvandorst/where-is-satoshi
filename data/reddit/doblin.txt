So would you recommend me stop using bitcoin get? I like to sit down and make a little bit of bitcoin at a time, like 25-50 cents worth each session.

But I was under the impression that since I acquired my .05 btc from bitcoin get, that if I wanted to to spend it , it would incur a transaction fee close or near to .05 thus making me unwilling to spend the .05?

Why? Should I not get it through bitcoinget? 
This is still confusing, can't seem to get a clear answer.

I think it is much lower than that, but what I am trying to figure out is if I decide to spend a portion of my current btc balance, will I be charged fees for the 42 transactions I received ?

No, I have received .05 btc doing tasks, which translates to about 26 dollars

Oh thank you, more things to learn about change tip looks interesting. Thank you again 
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:03:51
Correct, but if I want to buy something ( send )with bitcoin I believe I charged a fee
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:25:37
Oh I thought it would be a lot? But it's only pennies?c

So I have received about 26.00 in btc through 42 transactions. What would be the fee if let's say I tried to buy something through overstock.com?
