People moving from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Bitcoin cant scale, it is known. If it cant handle the amount of transactions in 2017 then how will it handle the volume in even a few years from now? Spoiler alert, it can’t.

Bitcoin is still prone to 51% attacks

Most alts are shit coins, ETH is not.

As far as i can tell it still takes 10 minutes to confirm a transact, if you are lucky and it doesnt actually take hours
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:51:30
Ethereum is the answer.

Get your hands on a few super computers and its game over
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:18:04
It is until it isn’t
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:25:17
Too long, tldw summary?
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:03:43
10% of the population is not “rich” by any standard
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:32:36
What does a game have to do with anything?
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:12:46
Can’t wait for ETH to overtake BTC and see all the cry babies here
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:26:35
Its still possible.

Dial up was the first to market, AOL was the biggest company out there on the internet. Sure did end up well.

I “get” bitcoin, but i still prefer Ethereum. Hours to confirm a transaction and fees in the dollar amounts. People that “get” bitcoin too would prefer Ethereum.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:45:17
Zero utility? Right so thats why hundreds of multi billion dollar companies are using it.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:16:25
You serious?
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:31:33
Yes, with Ethereum. Thousands of multi bullion dollar corporations are using the ethereum blockchain for smart contracts and audit/record keeping. Can’t says corporations are utilizing bitcoin. Even the ones that accept bitcoin as payment actually use third parties that accepts the bitcoin, converts it to USD, then gives it to the corporation. Bitcoin is becoming useless, im sorry dude.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:36:51
ETH at one point has 80% of the bitcoin market cap, so its very well possible that it could surpass bitcoin, sorry to break it to you buddy
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:15:59
Why would you do that? So you can pay conversion fees?
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:35:59
Ah so you would rather a hacker keep $40 million dollars of other peoples hard earned money. Got it!
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:12:21
Tell that to microsoft and the hundreds of other companies using ethereum...
@_date: 2019-08-01 01:03:37
Old technology, its like still using a flip phone when iphones came out years ago
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:58:27
Lol he had an “out of body experience” when he understood bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:18:08
Bitcoin cant be a world currency, imagine paying a 3 dollar fee for a 3 dollar cup of coffee, plus having to wait 10 minutes lmao
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:25:07
Transactions that take hours to confirm (even ten minutes is too long) and fees that can be as high as $40. Really what more could people want?
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:07:43
How does this work? I thought to buy or sell a share it has to be whole shares, not fractions
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:58:26
A store of value can not be something that loses 80 percent of its value in less than two years
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:05:05
Almost everyone who is buying it is doing it to make money, not to “store” their money, its the truth whether or not you use big bold letters
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:57:27
Serious question, who will be the person to stop him in court? Judges don’t know shit about crypto. We are going to need someone to represent us so he doesn’t convince the judge.

Don’t confuse adoption with investing. Still have a long way to go for adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:17:03
That didn't last long lol, can't wait for the BSV dump.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:49:04
File a complaint with the CFPB, if you are in the US. Coinbase would be required to respond within 15 days.
This is the biggest reason I can’t wait for TD Ameritrade to start crypto trading. You can have a million dollars in coinbase but not a single person to talk to over the phone. You can not have a single penny in TD Ameritrade and still call them 24/7.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:25:27
Because you can bury it in your backyard or throw it in the shredder and it wouldn’t matter. All you need to recover/transfer/steal the coins is the 24 word phrase.
