Hahaha that's amazing! How much did you save?
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:04:13
Thank you all for your feedback! I won't send him any bit then :)

Woooh, thank you very much Wingsuit. I wasn't expecting a tip :)

What a lucky guy, congrats!

You can buy a gift card at  or you can use  but it's not available worlwide.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:14:30
Wait, so China is responsible for this? I thought it was Russia.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:26:43
Who is this guy?
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:35:03
You can get something from Amazon (or other websites), by buying a Gift card on 
If games are your thing,  and  sell bundles for bitcoins, just like Humble Bundle.

Hello, I just came to say hi. Greetings from Chile (I'm hoping to see Coinbase in South America soon!)
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:07:06
So high right now (no pun intended)
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:18:28
Got it! thanks again

Keep rising, my dear.
Black friday is near.

I want Changetip on Facebook, that way I could encourage my followers (13k+) to use it and make them post interesting/constructive comments in my page, for tips. And ofc, it could bring much more attention to Bitcoin.

Ok I registered and found out it's cheaper to buy from here, so I have a question:
According to the website: "We currently support any of the international Amazon sites in the following countries:
United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, China, India, Japan"
The International Amazon sites' link is this one: 
Where it says "Spain", I can see more flags, including my country's flag (Chile). Does it mean that I can buy from Amazon with Bitcoins, using PurseIO? or is it available ONLY for the countries listed above?

How much can you win from this? is it okay if I register now? it just feel a bit spammy if I create an account and make 5 posts in the forums just for participating.
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:23:17
Report and move on, there's nothing else you can do (I received one of these $10 fake tips too)

I'd have to pay ~$15 for a bad quality mouse, bought with local currency. I like the fact that I can use bitcoin to buy stuff from other countries with $0 fees. Once I get extra money, I'm going to buy more bitcoins, I really like it!
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:38:36
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:00:54
The website has more payment methods (paypal, VISA, Mastercard, etc), I don't know if you can get that mouse somewhere else (since I didn't find much info about it). It's a chinese brand, I think, so I have no idea.

Is this an official extension? it looks pretty awesome!

I don't trust in cloud mining, it just doesn't make much sense to me. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:50:32
I've never tried Amazon ES, but I can buy from Amazon US (there are some items that do not ship to Chile, but most of the things are shipped internationally). 
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:40:41
At first I thought I was being trolled, but after seeing your profile, it's definitely Changetip's fault :/ thanks anyways for trying, I didn't expect that :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:38:55
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Bitcoin is the only way I could've buy it :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:09:29


I know that you are not begging, but you are still asking for bitcoins for participating, so it looks like you are breaking a rule here (correct me if I'm wrong).
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:48:09
nice ref link
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:24:09


English is not my main language, so I'm not sure if she said that. If I am right, what is the connection between BTC and WD?
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:50:45
Bought anything interesting with your bitcoins, or are you just holding? :)
