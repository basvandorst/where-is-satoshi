Yup. If it wasn't signed by Satoshi's private key, then it's not Satoshi. End of story. 
Real Satoshi always signed everything he said with his key. He probably did it so that people wouldn't be able to impersonate him after he left.

29 cents to process a $0.01 charge is kind of a lot, no?

The story is that there is no story, really. 
Some guy named Craig Wright was suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto. He's apparently a relatively smart guy, and Wired magazine published an article saying that he was probably Satoshi. He also had his house raided by Australian police. 
Then some Smart People On The Internet did more digging and determined he's probably full of shit. Coupled with the fact that there's literally no solid proof (nothing shared from his satoshin email address, nothing signed with his private key, no real proof other than him not saying that he's not Satoshi), it's safe to assume that the answer to your question is "there is no story". 
We'll probably never know who Satoshi is. That's probably for the better, really. This guy almost definitely isn't Satoshi.

He's not.

Dorian is easily the best "possible Satoshi" we've ever had. Super smart and just a delightful little old Japanese man. 
I mean he's obviously not Satoshi and he doesn't want to be associated with the name, but it'd be just lovely if he were. He just seems like a wise old grandfather.

Yup, this is going to be bad for their business. I was seriously considering buying one. Now they've scared me away for good. There's no way I'm paying $120 for something that's supposed to be super secure and isn't completely open source.

And as more people mine with better hardware, it'll be less than that. 
Thinking of this as mining any valuable amount is just stupid. It's barely even a miner at this point. Might as well call an Apple Watch a bitcoin miner, because *technically* it could be one.

I've seen it take up as much as 500GB in one solid month on my server at home. Thankfully I still have no bandwidth caps since there are multiple ISPs here and they wouldn't be able to pull that kind of thing (thanks capitalism and ISP competition!). As much as I'm hardly a fan of Verizon, FiOS doesn't have data caps (at least not where I live), I just leave Bitcoin Core running 24/7! 
There's really no reason for anyone to not leave it running as long as they have a reasonably decent computer with a big enough hard drive and an uncapped Internet connection. The only cost is electricity, which is minimal since the process doesn't use much processing power. You can even Bitcoin off anytime, so it's not like you can't use that computer at all! It just keeps the network running nice and speedy when you're not using that computer!

Most of Wall Street, I would assume. Several oil companies, several tech firms, a few major retailers probably.

That's certainly not the case in most of the rest of the world. I'm in the US and I needed a parent to come to the bank with me to do anything interesting until I was 18.

But you can mine bitcoins with it! At 50 gigahashes per second! That's... nearly $4 a month... 
I love how their Amazon page mentions lots and lots of weird jargon like "50 gigahashes per second" and "a stream of mined bitcoins" that make it sound like it'll be great for making huge BTC, when you'll be lucky to still be making $2/month by the end of this year. This thing isn't marketed at anyone who's ever owned any bitcoin mining hardware. It's marketed to people with too much money to burn who've heard of bitcoin from the news and don't want to jump in too late. 
Literally everything else it does can be done by a regular computer, as far as I can tell. They've put a nice little wrapper around bitcoind with a proprietary marketplace thing or a trading API of some sort that only works if everyone else buys this little toy. 
I can't find anything that this does that my phone can't do. Send and receive bitcoins? My phone does that. Mine a worthless amount of bitcoins? Never tried, but my phone can probably do that (not as much as this thing, but this thing will take a month to buy me a cup of coffee). Make and read ads for bitcoin services? Yeah, I have Google Chrome on my phone. I can even copy and paste bitcoin addresses from the web. I can even scan QR codes with my phone. 
This thing is such a let down. I was expecting a lot more from these guys with all this funding and speculation. They had fucking Andreesen Horowitz on board and all they got was a dedicated bitcoind device with a proprietary marketplace that nobody will use?

Yup. If you're a developer, run a full goddamn node. If you can't figure out how to set up bitcoind and you have to buy a $400 gadget instead, then you don't get to call yourself a developer.

I remember I told my mom about Bitcoin right after it'd bounced from $2 to $6. She said she might buy a few once it fell back down to $2. 
It did not fall back down to $2. 
It just kept going up. She could've bought in *anytime* for several months and made a nice profit. 
$500 here might be a good price. You might be able to sell it for a lot more in 10 years.

In general, it's a bad idea to store much bitcoin in an exchange anyway. If we're not in a bubble, move it out of the exchange anyway. 
A bubble could encourage an exchange owner to take your bitcoins and run. It could encourage hackers to hack an exchange and take your bitcoins from the exchange. 
A bubble raises the likelihood of an exchange losing its bitcoins, whether from internal or external forces. Don't store your bitcoins in an exchange to begin with. But definitely not now. Store them such that you own the private keys yourself. Or at least put them in a Coinbase vault with a trusted friend co-signing.

Seems like a bad idea if they think they're going to get their $400 chip into every device. I can't imagine why anyone would pay to have this pricey extra chip embedded into their phone or tablet or laptop when the CPU can handle bitcoin perfectly fine. 
My phone takes less than a second to create a bitcoin transaction and send it out to the network. The time that the transaction spends floating propagating the network before reaching the recipient takes even longer! I don't think any one will want an embedded chip specifically for bitcoin payments, especially in mobile devices where space is rare and the fight to build the thinnest phone is cutthroat. 
If they can get that, then that's great. But can't a CPU do everything this chip does almost as well?

Why would anyone want to be a developer for 21 Inc's platform? 
It's a weird proprietary API with literally no access to anyone without their $400 device. It'll never take off. 
Bitcoin is already having trouble taking off as it is, and it doesn't even cost anything to start using it. Imagine how much of a failure this 21 Inc platform is going to be. 
If you want to develop for their platform, you'll need their device. But nobody will want to develop for their weird closed-off platform.

Coinbase is significantly more secure than any exchanges, especially a Coinbase vault. If you don't know how to create offline paper wallets (or anything crazier, like brainwallets), just leave them in a Coinbase vault and have a trustworthy friend co-sign the vault. 
If you have enough that the very small chance of Coinbase vaults being raided somehow really scares you, you should know what a paper wallet is and you should know how to make one. Don't invest that kind of money in something you don't understand inside and out.

My $35 raspberry pi running a full bitcoind node with a 128GB microSD card as a hard drive agrees with you. The whole thing cost $60-ish and does almost everything that this gadget does.

I bought in and mined at $3, sold at $800, bought my first car. Not an amazing car, but a gently-used Corolla is more than enough to get me from home to school and back! 
I bought more coin a few months ago and I'm leaving most of it in there until I can afford a Tesla. A self-driving electric car paid for by magical Internet money. 
We're livin' in the fuckin' future, friends.

Wherever there isn't ISP competition, there are usually bandwidth caps. That rule would obviously hold true anywhere on earth (essentially) but most places in the developed world have fair competition among ISPs. I live in an area served by Optimum, AT&amp;T, and Verizon FiOS, and none of them have bandwidth caps because they know any customer they do that to will jump ship for a competitor in a heartbeat. Their prices are also much better here than they are in places where they're the only provider. 
Since a lot of Americans (about half) only have one ISP to choose from in their area, ISPs can treat their customers like shit and the only thing their customers can do is either band together to encourage competition (which can be hard, especially if ISPs lobby to stop competition from moving in, which they will) or just move to a different house. I'm planning on moving out of my place soon and ISP diversity is one of the things I'm most interested in in a new home.
