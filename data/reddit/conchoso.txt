Actually, upon further review of later comments here, it appears this title is more clickbait than we imagined, and there is no real need to upgrade here or get very excited, because:
1.  Apple has added nothing new bitcoin-related to iOS 12
2. These glyphs were only put in one (formerly) third-party App, by another company, that Apple recently bought and rebranded their existing App as an Apple first-party App.
3. These glyphs were already available in this App, before Apple bought it, and there is no need to update to iOS 12 to celebrate this.
Put away the champagne boys, this was clickbait.

Of course I read what you said, and yes I realize how purse.io works.
The story claims that people who get paid in Amazon credit and can't liquidate explains why purse.io can offer a 20-30% discount.
I'm saying people who have legit Amazon credit they don't want don't need to take that kind of haircut.  You can liquidate legit Amazon credits elsewhere for maybe 8-15% discount.
At the urging of Roger Ver and others who love this site, I tried it out and didn't like it.  Waited 3 days for my first order to be filled.  Then 4 days after purse.io tells me my order has shipped, they say Amazon has cancelled it.  Why?  Credit card fraud of course.

It could be tomorrow or could be in two years that Amazon decides they don't like what's going on here and pulls the plug on them somehow.

By "the one or perhaps two fiat currencies it traded in" I meant: if the bitcoin trade was single currency, just print it once, in the fiat currency it traded in.  If it was a cross-currency trade, print it twice, once for each of the fiat currencies it traded in.
This way you'd still be inflating your volume numbers, but to a much lesser degree, because you'd only be double counting cross-currency trades, instead of 11x counting all trades.

I mean the fraud is Amazon's problem because the way purse.io is set up, the credit card buyer of BTC's only payment interaction is directly with Amazon.  It's completely up to Amazon to detect if the purchase is valid before they ship anything, and to deal with it afterwards if they don't catch it in time.  For all Amazon may know, purse.io and the whole BTC transaction might not exist.  Except that maybe Amazon will notice some day the increasingly fraudulent activity coming from their wishlist feature.
And yes, I unfortunately think this kind of credit card-for-bitcoin scheme is doomed for failure.  There is something fundamentally different about offering a perfectly fenceable and unrecoverable asset for sale by credit card.  You can't compare it directly to dealing with physical goods, where a small percentage of fraud is sometimes acceptable.  Of course you usually can't order large quantities of gold online with a credit card either.
With stolen credit cards available online by the thousands, it's just too easy for the scammers to ruin the system.  Even if only one in a thousand orders gets thru Amazon's fraud detection, once the bad guys have the BTC, nobody's getting them back, and they probably won't get caught.

If you are a seller of legit Amazon credits with a good reputation/track record, you'll have people lined up on bitcointalk.org or  IRC to buy at 10-15% discount, and you'll make occasional deals for 0-10% discounts.
I do think it's an impossible problem to deal with.  Any time you offer to trade an easily stolen and cancelable payment method with an untraceable, uncancelable one, you'll have this problem.
I applaud purse.io (and Amazon) for coming up with their clever system and I very much wish it could work and I could use it, but I don't think it can.  There's just too many cleverer bad guys out there.
The thing is, purse.io may survive indefinitely with their clever system, because thanks to Amazon's clever order API and wishlist system, the fraud problem turns into Amazon's problem.
I only wasted my time and a few bits (because purse.io doesn't refund you every BTC you deposit) but I'd be worried about trying this more than once.  Amazon has your address and they know it's your wishlist people are shipping you stuff from with stolen credit cards.  I'm sure it happens occasionally even without purse.io, but given the stolen cc incentive, you're basically inviting the bad guys of the world to ship hot goods to your residence.
Terrible concept, avoid.

Hi, thanks for your write up and answer.  But perhaps you and I have different opinions on what is "wrong" in this case.
What you explained is exactly consistent with what I've observed watching the tape: you report the same trade 11 different times, once for each currency.
This is of course different from what every other exchange in the market does, which therefore makes your volume appear 11 times higher than all the other exchanges on websites that tally these things up.
I agree that running a multi-currency order book is the way to go for a bitcoin exchange, but you didn't invent it.  Mt. Gox worked that way (sort of ... and they didn't print every trade in every currency) but I suspect you guys are doing a better job of it.  But in any case, they way you guys are reporting trades is misleading at best and manipulative at worst.  You should just print the trade for the one or perhaps two fiat currencies it traded in, not all 11 you support.
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:18:13

I'm happy to keep discussing this too, because it's great to finally get some answers out of you.  If it gets difficult, it's because you don't have a leg to stand on here and the facts of the situation speak for themselves.
It would be ad hominem if I was attacking your article or argument by attacking you.  I'm not.  I'm just attacking you, and I'm doing so here because I (correctly) figured that you might reply with some answers, rather than just ignoring the situation for months like on bitcointalk.
But rather than continue attacking you, I'll give you (an underhanded) compliment: if I ever wanted to pull off a nefarious scheme, I would DEFINITELY hire you to be in charge of sales, marketing, and public relations.  You are really excellent at it!  Both in your ability to sell a turd sandwich AND to deflect any blowback that inevitably arises.  Your 'just so' storycraft is truly impressive.
So does that make me an angsty internet troll?  No, I'm just a guy that trusted you, invested with you, and lost everything.  And until now, I didn't even get your convenient version of what happened.
I never thought FeedZeBirds was that great of an idea, but I wanted to support you and your issue so I made a small token investment.  Big mistake.  Will I ever see a return ON that investment?  Of course not.  Will I ever see a return OF that investment?  Nope.  How about the refund you promised?  Sorry!  How about a timely apology and explanation to the shareholders as to why the business failed (with details of expenditures)?  Haha, right.  How about the pleasure of seeing you prosecuted for fraud?  Doesn't look that way!  How about harsh words?  Can I post harsh words about my experiences with you in reddit comments, without being called a troll?
What you call "not being on top of my communication with the shareholders" in your smooth parlance is what shareholders call "taking our money and disappearing".  And most people get pretty pissed off when you take other people's money and lose it with no explanation.  Especially when you promise a partial refund and then renege.
Calling you a shyster is not a sensationalist accusation.  It's a fact, look it up.

Hey Erik, before you pump out another one of these 2,600 word diatribes calling out someone for accusing bitcoin of being a scam, why don't you stop by your thread on bitcointalk and address your former FeedZeBirds shareholders, where you raised 2,452 BTC (illegally), did essentially nothing, promised a (partial) refund, and then disappeared:
While it's great that someone wants to stand up and defend bitcoin from these kind of attacks, when the person doing the defending himself is accused of scamming it just makes you and the rest of us look dumb.

There are two key points missing from your analysis: the first is that the speculators that dump your coins will also need to buy them back at some point.  It's usually just as hard to short sell and cover lower for a profit as it is to buy and sell for profit.  The second is the existence of hedgers, arbitrageurs, and miners who also may need to occasionally borrow btc but won't necessarily dump them on the market for short term profit.
Yes, being able to borrow and short is healthy for all trading markets.
Personally, eventhough I'm sure I'll hold some btc for months and years to come, I don't lend them because I don't feel that I'm properly compensated for the counterparty risk of one of these exchanges messing up the scheme, but clearly there are plenty who don't share that opinion.

Convenient.  Always a convenient reply.


That's not correct.  The GLBSE (eventually) provided a list of bitcoin addresses for all shareholders to issuers.  Issuers who were real businesses reconnected with their shareholders and moved on.  Those that were scams did nothing and used the failure of the GLBSE  as an excuse for their loses.  It's clear which category yours was.
So the bottom line here is that investors gave you money and got nothing.  You and The SEC seem to have a pretty sweet deal where you get away scot free and they get the money.
And not a word of this to your investors until months later when this comes out in random reddit comments.  Just convenient stories and undelivered promises.
Community, this kid is a shyster.  Slick, slick, and shady.  Stay away.  Every time I see him start waiving the bitcoin flag to defend us or offering to debate somebody, I can't help but think that he's the only one who has literally gotten away with a scam around here.

2.) search bitcointalk.org for the post by jgarzik with info on how to download a recent snapshot of the blockchain via bittorrent.  I think there is also someone who does a nightly direct dl snapshot but I forgot how to find it.

I'd agree with most of the advice here.  Getting some Casascius coins would be a good option to actually have something tangible to have on Xmas morning.  But if he's planning to immediately spend them on something it doesn't make much sense to pay the premium for the physical coins.  And to order the Casascius coins you can only pay in Bitcoins.
I suggest you buy some Bitcoins with Coinbase or BitInstant and then use a portion of them to order some Casascius coins and then send him the balance so he has both some physical and digital bitcoins.

All the main bitcoin exchange websites work (for the most part) in Safari on the iPad.  I also suggest  for charts and market data.
These are obviously not native apps but you can even save them as an icon on the home screen thru Safari, and they all work pretty good (just like on a desktop trading experience), the main benefit being that there's no need to get anything thru Apple's screening, which suggests that a native bitcoin trading app will probably never appear in the App Store.
If you've jailbroken you can install Mt.GoxLive's iPhone app and run that as a native app to trade on your iPad.

We've been in a general downtrend since the beginning of October, and hovering just below $11 for all of November.  On this news the price rallied up to 7% in less than a day.  More importantly, it's the most significant move to the upside in over two months, and now that the downtrend has been broken market prices will probably continue to appreciate going into the block reward halving coming around Thanksgiving.
You still have much to learn my young padawan.

Yes, this was actually shocking to me as well.  Slashdot could probably be considered the absolutely IDEAL target audience to be early-adoptors of Bitcoin.  Yet reading thru their comments I'm am flabbergasted at the negativity, misconceptions, and downright uninformed viewpoints expressed there.
What is even more bizarre is that it was the original "Slashdotting" of the Bitcoin/Wikileaks story way back when that got Bitcoin its first widespread exposure and really got the ball rolling in term of Bitcoin actually trading as something of value.  You'd think after rising to $30 (then falling) and $12.50 from basically zero at their first exposure, they'd at least be willing to take a fresh or more open-minded look at things, but perhaps recent history only feeds their "ponzi scheme" mentality.
I'm not really sure what to make of this, apart from the fact that if Slashdotters are this slow and hesitant to "get" Bitcoin, we could really be in it for the long haul before we can make believers out of the rest of the world.

This statement makes no sense.  The bitcoin market is unique in that the order book is publicly available?  That's not true at all.  The order book is publicly available for most exchange traded assets.
In fact, the bitcoin market is probably much harder to analyze (correctly) in this way because it trades on many different exchanges, in different countries and currencies (which are also moving at the same time), each with different rules and funding options, and in different data formats.  (Of course these guys only bothered to analyze Mt.Gox data.)  Whereas order books for stocks, ETFs, futures, etc. can be downloaded from any Bloomberg or Reuters terminal with ease.

one other little comment here for you, now that I've used the site a bit more:
most of your bets close betting and then end the event date at "midnight EST" on the date in question.  technically 12:00 a.m. midnight is the start of the new day, not the end of the day that just passed.  so for bets that end on August 31, which you say are ending at "midnight EST" are really ending at 11:59:59 pm on August 31st because they include all day on the 31st.
since this is a betting site, you should probably try to be as unambiguous as possible and change this to say 11:59:59pm or something if that is what you really mean.

If the physical gc was purchased with cash and a matching photo of a receipt, it is much more unlikely that Amazon will cancel it.
A digital gift code can be purchased with any hacked or stolen credit card number and can be canceled at any moment by Amazon with no recourse.
That's why there's two different prices.  And it's not just that trading digital gift codes for bitcoin is high risk, it actually ATTRACTS risk because the bad guys know that the moment they get their hands on the bitcoin, they've gotten away with it.

Great, I received my lucky 0.5 btc promotion bonus, thanks so much!
Ok, so I've played around with it a bit, so here are my 0.5 btc's worth of free thoughts for you.
The things I like:
1.) the web site design is very clean and well done.  I can tell you are a professional web designer.
2.) my initial BTC deposit went smoothly and fast.  I don't know exactly after how many confirms it showed up, but it seemed a lot less than 6 (like usual).
3.) I like your system for time weighting early bets.  Good idea.
4.) I like your payout and fee structure.  Seems about right to me.
5.) and I like that it is all 100% Bitcoin-only, of course!
Things I didn't like:
1.) your betting system seems different than most other prediction markets I have seen.  at first glance, it seems like it's only really possible to (easily) bet on statements that are approximately 50% likely to be true.  What about very likely or unlikely statements that on other sites with different betting systems where the market can bet/move the likelihood to be like 90% or 10%?
2.) likewise with your unusual betting system, it's not clear or obviously easy for me to back out what "the market is saying" is the implied probability of a future event occurring?  If 1 BTC is currently bet on Barack Obama getting reelected, and 0.2 BTC against, what is the implied probability of that happening?  Given your complex, multi-part, time-weighted payout formula, it isn't obvious to me.
3.) I don't like that once a bet is made, it is final, and you cannot cancel it or change it.  Maybe there is a Bitcoin-specific reason you've done this, but I'd have to think about that a bit deeper.
4.) Related to above, and these other dislikes, there is no ability to trade in and out of a bet as the implied odds and market changes.  Also, no way to graph over time how the odds change.
So overall, a solid effort and a welcome and needed addition to the Bitcoin community, but unless I'm missing something, I think you should have just gone with the betting system I've seen on most other prediction markets where each statement is issued as "share" and then that share can be bought and sold throughout the life of the bet at some percentage of 1 (in Bitcoins of course) until the bet expires with the share worth 1 or 0.  In other words, I would have just copied Intrade's site but with everything in Bitcoin.

It's happened to me way more than once where I've sat there clicking the top BUY button a million times wondering why their site is unresponsive.

I know, same thing happened to me in a different country.  Except that I just had to sit in the branch for the better part of a day before they'd even acknowledge my money was there.

The dealers I (half-jokingly) propositioned that I wanted to pay in bitcoin looked at me like I was from another planet.
So I went and bought it online from Beepi:
They just announced today they're now delivering (continental) nationwide.
I was pretty happy about the whole experience, except for the fact that they said they'd get me "BITCOIN" vanity plates, but they didn't.

I am likewise in a similar situation.  I also used to dislike all alt-coins but have come around on Litecoin.
My view is that it is technological and legal diversification.  If there is ever a major glitch with Bitcoin, or a Bitcoin exchange, or Bitcoin mining, or a fork, or DOS, or some uppity legislator tries to block or ban Bitcoin for whatever reason, a robust and working Litecoin network chugging away on the backburner will make the world a better place.

Fascinating discussion.  I cannot ever recall watching an hour long "debate" and felt that I agreed with (or at least sympathized with) most of what BOTH guys were saying.
I do like both these guys, on both their philosophies and styles.
Both guys made minor flubs and showed limits to their understanding of things, but for the most part I'm going to have to score this debate a draw.
Before watching this I was squarely in the Stefan camp and thought Peter was off the mark with some of his recent comments on bitcoin.
But now after watching, even though Peter clearly doesn't have as deep an understanding of bitcoin and what it could do, it's hard to ignore his pragmatism, and I cannot avoid the sensation that looking into the future a few months we'll be more likely to (once again) be watching videos of Peter Schiff telling us "I told you so" and thinking "why didn't I listen?".
So now what do I do ... 50% gold / 50% bitcoin and rebalance quarterly?

MagicalTux mentioned in  the other day that they are processing some "large" withdrawals manually.  
It was also claimed that since the Dwolla option was removed, requests for bank wire withdrawals has overwhelmed their bank's automated system to process them, and the "2 weeks" thing is their estimate as to the time required to move the operation to a new bank's system.

I've seen a lot of replies here suggest TradeHill.  I know their marketing suggests they specialize in large trades, but can anyone here confirm they're actually doing any large trades with them?
They don't seem to report volume figures to bitcoincharts.com and the "monthly volume" figure on their own website suggests they're trading less in a month than Mt.Gox does in two (very slow) days.

Ok, I see you misunderstood which "rule" I was referring to.
I was referring to the rules of how to write possessives in English, which is complex.
Your "rule", which is absolutely simple, really isn't a general rule of any kind, as it is itself the exception.  Your rule only (correctly) works with one word.
So to answer your question, again, the reason people fuck this up is that possessive "its" is an exception to the already complex rules of forming possessives in English.  And they apparently aren't familiar with your simple one-case "rule" that could have helped them.

the story of the first little hottie to do "the world's oldest job" for "the world's newest currency" has probably got plenty of free publicity legs going for it, probably more so than a treasure hunt.

Yup, that sounds about right for an honest business trying to make ends meet under The Evil Empire

You should look at TradeLog, which is what non-bitcoin traders use:
Just copy what they have but with bitcoins.

They don't give 2 shits about your $15 ... they want your name/address/credit card info/demographic data that they may not get if you pay with bitcoin.

this article didn't mention anyplace where you can actually buy porn with bitcoin.  it's not nearly as available as the headline might suggest.

I'm no lawyer, but my reading of FinCEN's recent guidance on Bitcoin would suggest that anyone (in the U.S.) who buys more than $1000 dollars of bitcoins from him (per day) would need to be a registered MSB.  Fuk da police.

I thought we agreed to never allow the words "Amir Taaki" and Bitcoin to be released together in the mainstream media again.  did SkyNews not get the memo?

how bout you post us some free promotional codes and we tip you in bitcoins directly and fuck Apple?
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:43:08
Yes, which is probably why I was downvoted to oblivion because I posted a comment like this in a few of those 'mandatory upgrade' threads.
The unfortunate fact of the matter (for Mac users) is there is no stable v0.8.* Mac release yet and we have this mandatory upgrade thing coming up.  I certainly hope they get something worked out soon.

I like the way you're thinking but unfortunately the job isn't running a bitcoin exchange, the job is running an anti-money laundering/anti-fraud/customer service business, which seems a whole lot less interesting to me.

right about ....... NOW!
it's already more profitable to mine scrypt-based alt coins with GPUs than Bitcoin.  given the recent ASIC ramp up it will soon be just ludicrous to waste your electricity GPU mining bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-11-24 00:40:58
Here's a better theory:
Rather than buying drugs or partnering with DPR, perhaps early miner xfered BTC to SR to SELL bitcoins anonymously (with trusted escrow) for cash in mail, or whatever.  Apparently people did this, but I have no idea to what extent.  Could someone have moved 1000 BTC for cash thru SR at this time?

Hey remember: if a costly service is "free", it's because you are the PRODUCT, not the CUSTOMER.
They've got every right to try to earn some advertising revenue  from that very useful but "free" site they've created.

set coinbase.com (or something else simple) as the default Safari homepage for your 1000 users.  install bitcoin-qt for Mac as a default app on your machines.
that would probably have a more positive impact for bitcoin and your users than mining with NVidia/Macs.
