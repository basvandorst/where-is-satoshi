If they're wrong, then they are making a foolish mistake by not buying in early; there might be a huge crop of unintentional millionaires and billionaires if this thing takes off. 
If they're right, then I expect in the near future some lawsuits against companies that paid in bitcoin.

My understanding is that the waybill for the return voyage was signed after that email saying they were working on it, indicating that it was received after they made the claim that they were working on it.

It has implicit faith and credit though insofar as its value is a function of eventual fungibility - any person at any point in time theoretically should be able to exchange it for legal tender, which is ultimately backed by something. The moment that stops, is the moment that the currency loses meaning.

Not sure what you mean by underselling. But brain toxo is most commonly associated with AIDS, but in general it can happen in anyone with severe immunodeficiency. Even in AIDS patients it is still rare.

Enough cases that you make a few tens of millions of dollars. Additionally, elite academic hospitals and major regional centers where cases are transferred have to stock a supply just in case. It can't be ordered on an as needed basis and Amazon prime-d. Once the diagnosis is made, antibiotics need to be started very soon.

This medication is only used almost exclusively for toxoplasmosis in the brain, a very rare condition seen almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients (most of whom have extensive follow-up and are already plugged into the healthcare system because to deserve this prescription means that you had to be ill enough with a life threatening brain infection). 
There is no reason why you'd routinely buy this outside of normal channels. For non-CNS infections Bactrim is a common medication with a similar mechanism and efficacy (just doesn't have good brain penetration - hence Daraprim)
