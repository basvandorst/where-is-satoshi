And block the accounts immediately because of just that? Whaaa
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:34:31
Same as today.

To be honest, such service should be independent from anyone, any website, company whatever. One should download an open source package and do the whole thing with it. Or one should make their own tool / do it manually.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:42:58
Wouldn't that take years?
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:47:05
Just in case you didn't get it, it's not a literal average joe.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:27:43
And that's why I don't like likes, upvotes, downvotes and similar. World would be better without them.
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:35:21
And upvoting spam isn't that helpful either.
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:44:14
Reviewing transactions? Just to see if there's no hidden income or for what? Kinda ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:06:58
How so? After its split its sent to one address, you can see the transactions of that address and find every address then through these addresses the original address.
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:37:47
Bullshit. There's no difference here, you could have done the same with similar results.

I just bought ONE FULL BITCOIN, not a half, the whole bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:03:06
Flappy bird and metal slug.

It can only be hard to differentiate the address that was the original sender of the money if there are few such senders at the same time, otherwise you can find it by time stamps. Also if there are few senders at the same time there still is only one recipient of the money, one can see that the recipient had received money from tumbling service by checking the character of transactions. This is a security risk. Also, do you think special forces wouldn't be alerted by such transactions and wouldn't look closely for them?
Ah, if the tumbling addresses are depended to anyone, that isn't secure.

And who the fuck eats the same apple twice.
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:31:23
Cause I'm not like some people who will piss on something just because they don't like it.
And no, it's not most.

How do I pay in mycelium?
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:21:50
Can i pay with any card? I'm not from US.
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:51:14
You can simply transfer it to a bank account...
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:11:53
Is it love?
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:38:58
Bitcoin is good.
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:35:06
Good advice. I'm definitely not going to sell it all and am investing a small number.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:47:36
I don't really want to buy a dozen of graphics cards, that would be more hassle than verification.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:47:02
And I heard it was easier in 2011 and that now it's not so profitable and that I won't mine anything of a reasonable value without a proper miner. So I don't think I could do that on my home PC, but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:15:16
Yes, are hear.
@_date: 2014-12-24 09:38:03
And no one is gonna see a huge number of small transactions at the same time to one address?
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:43:26
That's really nice to hear. I sell weapons for bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:17:11
Are you saying that this sniper scene is set up? It would require them to make something similar to a fictional movie as I understand.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:21:20
Like a cancer :))))))))))))))
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:49:33
If there's anything I'll want to buy and will have a choice to buy in bitcoin, why not do that. Beside that, I heard one guy saying that if you believe it will be strong in ten years, buy and keep it and you will earn multiple of that, or loose. So I will buy a small amount to support it and I'll be glad to earn something on that if the guy's right :)

I believe you could try to recover it. If the data wasn't TRIMed then it's still there. There could be a photorec (testdisk) like thing for android or you could try that from the PC.

This is the same kind of investment though. No guarantee of employment. The only thing you can be sure of is debt.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:56:45
I don't have enough. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
