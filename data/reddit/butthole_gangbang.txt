If I was a gold bug, I would be more fearful of silver than Bitcoin. 
Silver : currency, store of value, and a manufacturing metal required in an advanced economy. 
Peak silver reached in 2015 and the second largest mine closed down, probably for years. As Gold has a stable amount above ground. Silver is decreasing due to built in obsolescence. Silver in the next few years will eclipse Gold in price and leave it way behind, as Bitcoin has done.

Everything in this thread is about politics, since politics is about manipulation and centralising power. Bitmain is one of the main tools of the Chinese Communist Party.

The reason for the NY Agreement was to sidetrack UASF on the 1st of August. The Chinese Communist Party, the power behind Bitmain, is attempting to take control of Bitcoin. Segwit reduces this option. SegwitX2 guarantees a block increase in 3 months, so centralising mining in China, while we are gambling centralising on the off chance the Communists may allow segwit. (which they will not) . We are all being played as fools.
A hard fork will create two coins in November. I'm saving my fiat up until then so to buy the non chinacoin chain.

In the market, there is chaos. Quotations are rapidly declining: ether already costs only about $ 200, bitcoin has fallen in price to $ 2300. A sharp surge in popularity of crypto-currencies led this year to an explosive growth in their value - by hundreds of percent.
 Interest has shown literally everything: from bankers from Wall Street to Chinese housewives. As it turned out, the system is not ready for such an influx of participants, and now the key topic among the participants of cryptology is the threat of bitcoin crushing, that is, the currency can be divided into two parts.
Transaction processing with bitcoins is performed in so-called blocks that use complex cryptography to confirm and conduct transactions. Each block in the chain is limited to 1MB - before that was enough, but today the system began to work too slowly. Sometimes the process can stretch to several hours. Because of this, many companies that provide systems for working with bitcoin, increase the minimum transaction size and charge operations with a commission.
The solution of the problem is offered by two camps Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and Segregated Witness (SegWit). In fact, these are like two different schools with different views, and the interests of some do not coincide with the interests of others. 
Compromise is difficult to find, this frightens market participants. It's just that no one really knows what will come of it. 
July 21 will be presented to the software SegWit2x, then until the end of the month will check how many miners working on the new system. If their share is more than 80%, it signals the avoidance of a split in the community, but if not - the tension will only increase.
In this case Bitcoin, most likely, will begin to exist on both block circuits in parallel, which will lead to two versions of the crypto currency. In this situation, there is no doubt that traders will quickly overestimate the value of both, which is likely to lead to high volatility.

If the entrenched powers accepted this period of anarchy as a sign of the old ways are a dying, and it's time for building a new economic model, then bitcoin would rise quickly, since blockchain technology would be centre of this new system. I suspect it's bitcoin's time and we already have the internet in place for it's fast acceptance. I suspect there is no slower time vector path.
