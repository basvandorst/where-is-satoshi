BitLicense must be scaled back 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:17:12
BitLicense was the single biggest topic at the North American Bitcoin Conference today in Chicago. The Bitcoin community is ready to come after this thing.

I appreciate the feedback. Definitely no lack of content from the weekend and plenty more to be shared with the community.

Indeed. Mathematics won't let us down and is less corruptible institutional sycophants.

Global Payments services more than 1 million merchants around the globe. This will expand merchant adoption in addition to use in emerging markets. Very positive news for bitcoin

A few things everyone can do in the face of the proposed BitLicense regulation.

Not sure if this was meant to provide answers, but rather dialogue regarding the current climate. What's the main question you're looking for more information / guidance on?

In my opinion, governments could always put together a normalized framework where they would get their "cut". With Bitcoin being such a threat to the traditional banking system, I think our regulators are getting enormous pressure to impose draconian measures...as those bankers are likely in the regulator's pockets. Government isn't so much the problem here as the interests exercising undue influence on our lawmakers.

To the moon or muddle through?

Does the regulation need to be strong, fair, or both for Joe Public to get involved?

The strings of the monetary system have always been manipulated by British power. This is how Britain regains a more visible role as a monetary power even though they were in charge all along.
Still bullish as fuck.

Highlights of day 2 of the North American Bitcoin conference!

Does this survive if BitLicense goes through in it's current form?
@_date: 2014-08-10 16:06:39
Indeed. So many layers here...easy to forget who is who sometimes :)

I CAN'T CONTROL THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE

Agreed. It's a total perception issue. Reality is that Bitcoin is probably safer than many banks (i.e. Lehman), and is less susceptible to confiscation (i.e. Cyprus) but the public still perceives the established system is more or less bullet proof. Bitcoin, unlike banks, doesn't make promises it can't keep

I'm all for this but I think we need to address the censorship and sudden "bannings" going on in reddit today. For example, banksworstfear.com, a bitcoin website without advertisements that survives on tips was recently banned without any avenue for recourse. Doesn't seem too censorship resistant, bitcoin / tipping / no advertisement friendly to me quite yet.

I wish the regulation was laissez-faire, but the actions of our lawmakers say otherwise...
