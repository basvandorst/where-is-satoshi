@_date: 2018-01-28 13:06:38
Yes, my brother we should hold until Lord Satoshi makes his return riding a comet. We will follow the example of brother McAfee to remove our vestiges of our previous animal nature. Only those who have shown their faith by holding our bitcoins. The holy white paper is the purest truth. Those that fathom the perfection of the blockchain see that this is self-evident. Our unenlighted brothers dream of Lambos and banging hot dudes and chicks. They see only bitcoin as compared to fallen and unclean USDT with it peg to evil USD. But you and I brother see that true pefection is its own trading pair. I pray that these unenlightened brothers may learn to see beyond Lambos to eternal truth through the Blessed Lord Stoshi. HODL and prosper my brother.

This is assuming you have a real Trezor. Did you take it from the end of the assembly line yourself. Verify the souce code build, verify hash, sign the binary and burn the code to the MCU and blow the JTAG connections yourself? If not then, you don't know shit. I wish noobs who have bought a hardware wallet would stop acting like they are the smartest guy in the room. At this juncture, it would actually make sense to devote the time and money to getting fake wallets out there that have subtle security flaws into the supply chain for these things. Just something to think about.

The trope while funny simply isn't true. The US spends 3.5GDP on military. About twice the Eurozone in total. High but not as crazy as everyone seems to think. The US also spends a lot of money on education as well. The trouble in both cases is it spent in a super inefficient manner. So for the same money the US gets less.

Why? What is the advantage in this? To live everyday life, you need sell Bitcoin and the fiat will appear in your account when the exchange and the bank feel like it.

The time to have gotten on this rocket was at $1300/BTC. When something has gone exponential without you on it, it is best to leave it alone unless you want your money tied up for years waiting for a recovery when the correction comes.

Got news for you people have already been locked up for not reveiling passwords. Contemp of court. Currently, in the US, passwords don't have the same protections as safe combos. People in other places have even less protections. The US is actually one of the best places in the world for this. But if you tell them you "lost" your provate keys and they have good reason to think you are bullshitting, they will put you in jail to help you to remember. As I stated before encrypted storage is useless when they have you in custody. What is your freedom worth? I would personally rather be free and penniless. I am guessing as long as people are generally comfortable, they will continue to allow greater intrusions especially when they appear to be directed at unsavory groups.

Every two weeks there comes some dust-up over some arcane technical detail and everyone fights like children about it. If it is a hard fork, it makes essentially competing versions of bitcoin. The safe bet is to stay with legacy bitcoin and to keep you coin in your own not online wallet. If you do this, you can make some money off a fork by selling the coins on the other block chain to true believers in the other chain. The could come a time where another chain get enough support to survive on its own kind of like Roman Catholics and Eastern orthodox churches.

It isn't dillution of the whole but a question of trade volume on a given day. It would appear that on a day like today with roughly 60k coins volume the 1800 would be 3%. For a coaotic system like a market may be a big effect maybe not.

@_date: 2017-09-19 02:25:24
No it is the same as keeping a safe full of gold in your room in the worst neighborhood imaginable. There will NEVER be a time when the security situation for bitcoin will be so easy.

Actually, no. If you were running a business entirely in bitcoin, would be ruined by the run-up relative to actual raw inputs.It is extreme deflation. It is why moderate inflation is tolerable and why central bankers avoid deflation at all costs. They may be guilty of many things, but the inflation, in truth, hurts very little compared to the boom-bust cycles they produce.

I see three long term trends for bitcoin. I imagine that it will go nuts when China finally hits the wall and in the ensuing crisis is it used as a safe haven and means of transferring wealth out. The others are it is use worldwide for all types of criminal enterprises as well as it replacing the backbone of the remittances sent by workers worldwide back to their home counties.

Be careful with Tails when using it to transfer to and from exchanges.  Do not use TOR it is very common to see man in the middle attacks on it.

Quite frankly the only use I have for bitcoin is for fast cheap transfers. If it fails either, I am using something else. Bitcoin could very well find itself obsoleted by something better from the view point of stability, security, or cost of transactions. What the future holds for it, who knows. This is software it moves as fast as human thought and ingenuity.

The last reply is an interesting one " - If the client and server are both using at least TLS 1.2 your HTTPS connection is still considered to be safe in practice. However the bulk of the SSL/TLS vulnerabilities discovered in the last couple years have required 1 common factor: Man in the Middle style access to a target's connection. Generally this requirement has meant in most cases the SSL weaknesses discovered could not be used on the greater public, but in the case of Tor you are forcing an intentional man in the middle, making HTTPS untrustable in many situations.

I had pondered this before. In fact Bitcoin is deflationary. Imagine a whole system based on Bitcoin. It would be crippling to run a business entirely in it. Build a car for X bitcoins and sell it for X-1, you wouldn't be in business for long. Bitcoin seems to be invented by a group who regard any amount of inflation as bad. The killer apps for bitcoin in my view are easy and fast transferablility. I could theoretically carry every bitcoin in existence on anything carrying my private key.   Paper, micro etching, any information medium in existence. The US government regards bitcoin as property and not currency. This correct in my view. Bitcoin is like gold but even more so as it has has no other uses outside of a store of value.

Can anyone explain to me why anyone is still on Bitfinex. Without a way to get fiat out of it, seems to place one's one's money there is a dead end. Day trading?
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:39:49
$15 to get you started.

Maybe not that high but it will go wild when China finally hits the wall. The financial crisis at that time will be a once in 100 years event. The Chinese will likely make huge use of bitcoin to get out of Chinese currency and ultimately out of China.

The current one has already happened ask the fools bought at the top of the last rally. The next bearish thing that happens will likely pull the price back into line with long term trend.

I am not sure it would be bad for bitcoin to have some sort of fixed and predictable built-in inflation. Though, suppose until all outstanding coins are mined, there is some sort of inflation out there.

It seems everything in BTC world happens in fast-forward.

What other sage wisdom do you have for us?
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:41:41
The rationale is that the preceding boom is based purely in speculation. There is no fundamental basis for the current price.

I think there must be an internet law out there that no matter what picture a person posts of a child, someone will be bound to chime in about how to raise it. Mostly, calling whatever in the pic some sort of bad parenting.

Of course this is a bubble. What fundimental reason is there for this price rise? It is rising because it is rising. Secondly, in a bubble everyone always says this time is different the rules don't apply. Lastly, it should be noted that bitcoin is suffiently low volume that it quite vulnerable to manipulation. Get ready for it kids. As a rule I leave stuff alone when it is in an exponential rise. Stay in if you like the odds but be aware it is gambling not investing.

Haha - Sell now whatever Goldman says, do the opposite. It is a good strategy for life.
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:21:35
Sorry, but something gains like bitcoin in course of a month, its a bubble. We are currently in the "new normal" phase after the dead cat bounce. The shit show is coming. I'll be buying at $1300/BTC. Enjoy the ride.

Except they will confiscate his bitcoin. Unless, he has been very sneaky, they can figure out what wallets he owns and tell him that they will have him in for the rest of natural life if he does not play ball. Remember extortion is only illegal if we do it.

Calling bullshit on this. Theoretically possible but seriously these days anyone with that kind of money is not going to do that. Imagine washing your own wallet with that key in it. Probably a troll post or worse yet a confidence scam.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:17:32
The Chinese at that time won't want PRC shitcoin they will want the real thing to get their wealth the hell away from their government. All the rich in China are planning their escape when the shit hits the fan. They aren't stupid they didn't survive the great leap by being stupid they can read the writing on the wall. The question is not if it is when. But never you worry the corrupt US banking sector will accept these fiat conversions with open arms and no questions asked.

Naw the guys are usually pedos and other assorted felons. Meth heads would have sold all of the wiring.

The question may be in the end if it was worth the opportunity cost to have your money tied up for years waiting for it to come back. Good riddance really to me. I'd like to get back to using bitcoin as money and not some sort of baseless "investment'.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:31:47
I hope you're kidding. In case anyone out there still thinks that the answer is no, not unless you go to great lengths to make it so, especially if someone has physical access to your machines.
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:42:56
Not really the price was that LOW 2 months ago.

Well, strap in. I think this is going to $10,000.

I can say bitcoin has advantages and disadvantages. The fees compare well to SWIFT for small transactions. In Vietnam the total fees for a SWIFT transfer are a minimum of $35 end to end. That is assuming they allow you to do it. I would be suprised if Thailand didn't have capital controls in place. Bitcoin is selling at a 15% premium online. A dollar to send to the exchange and a $2 fee to do a internal US bank transfer.  So at roughly $230 and above it makes more sense to use SWIFT for international tranfers. Security for bitcoin will always be an issue. It like keeping all cash in your house except that every criminal on yhe net can have a go at you.

I hate to say this but bitcoin is a huge pain in the ass to actually use as a currency. Until, a solution that doesn't require huge machinations to keep malware and hackers from stealing your shit, it will remain a curiosity for the hyper-technical.

I figured TAILS was a route to having a trusted machine that had been used for nothing but logging into the exchanges. I figure it minimalist nature would leave less attack surface for malware. I agree that TOR is a major draw for TAILS but I have no intention of using it as it letting some random dude handle my connection.
