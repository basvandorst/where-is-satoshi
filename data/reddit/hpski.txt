This is exactly what I wanted to say.
These weekly posts about how BTC-e is horrible and will be taken down soon, for which there is no basis thus far besides "They're not transparent compared to x exchange", is getting ridiculous now. Keeping your coins on an exchange is beyond idiotic to begin with.

I hadn't visited r/bitcoin for about two weeks before... well, right now... and I come to see this.
@_date: 2014-01-11 10:56:05
Yes, it does.

Having been a long time subscriber of this subreddit, this doesn't put me off by any means. It just sometimes amazes me that there are people(or rather, there's a certain group of people) in this very particular community who think one or two posts aren't enough, aside from the more intelligent people who would come to the conclusion that perhaps it's time to move to another pool for some time without half of the first page being filled with "DON'T MINE ON *poolnamehere*" instead of relevant news/articles/discussion.
And, to be fair, I doubt all this spamming played a big part in actually moving the hashing power away, assuming that people with any kind of significant hashing power actually use [this]( and a bit of common knowledge as far as 51% is concerned, which is to be expected in my opinion.

Unless I misunderstand this, your GTX1060 is mining at 0.004 BTC/day? What are you mining?

You're still dodging his question, which was to cite sources that back up your own research. 
Any "advice" on bitcoin should be taken with a grain of salt, selling all of your real estate for bitcoin should be taken with a handful...

I'd be more than happy to provide feedback to you, assuming that I'm not late. My address is 1Q31Su4915r3bXUT54YCUEWq9RzoGMz8Y7 - thanks in advance.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:37:07
Yes, that's true. Buying an ASIC rig is somewhat pointless as BFL seems to be bullshitting us and Avalon is being somewhat sluggish with delivery.
Oh well... as they say, "technology evolves over time".

Couldn't find any for my Pentax. =( Any other recommendations?

Oh, thanks.

Ah, cool. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:18:02
Haha. That's the same problem I thought of - if it really went down to 0, not only would the current holders of BitCoin be screwed, but everybody else as well.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:08:23
Much appreciated, keep up the good work!

No point in saying "If you won't give coins back, I'll sue you!". The damage has already been done, regardless of whether he gives the coins back or not.
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:42:45
That's really useful info, thanks. Looking into buying one.
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:23:06
As long as it's US only, it'll be of no use to me. Still sticking to exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:28:16
Meh... I only get 230 Mhash/s after upgrading to 13.3 Beta because explorer.exe constantly had these black boxes that would appear when mining. Mine is a 2GB Sapphire 7850.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:13:54
Cool, thanks for the info. I've figured out that ASIC rigs are the way to go at this point in time since some profit calculators show that GPU mining is less profitable when it comes to BC mining.
Not sure whether to laugh or cry about corporations not getting into this BC mining rig business. I guess laugh. :P
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:36:14
I really like this. Might be an impulse purchase for me, but this somewhat gives bitcoins a physical feel(even though the purpose of bitcoin is totally opposite lol).
I think your wallet cards will become more popular amongst people.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:47:25
*claps* Really, BFL?
If only every customer was a journalist or a publisher...
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:22:21
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:41:53
Thanks for the tip. I installed the 13.3 beta drivers and got rid of the artefacts with my 7850, at the expense of 20 Mhash/s.

"Order up to 4 Mini Rigs and pay the same standard, flat shipping price."
So if I ordered 5, I'd have to pay double the shipping? Oh noes!
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:08:12
Sorry for asking this, but how does this exactly happen? How does one "steal" another's coins from a wallet only knowing the address?
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:49:38
Could you please explain more if you're willing to? Where did you get your rig?
Quite new to this BitCoin thing, been reading about it for the past week. Miners are still somewhat of an unknown thing to me.
@_date: 2013-08-06 09:19:25
Awesome! I also took up the 1 BTC challenge. Grown it to about half a bitcoin so far! 
Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-07-05 02:24:03
Giving this a shot.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:01:57
Alrighty, sent 0.001 to the account and I'm happy to report that it works. I do like the militaryish feel(with the word's "beta" font being the cherry on the cake), but I do feel that you should have more themes. Not necessarily completely new designs, but perhaps different colour schemes. circutry's blue theme is something I have in mind!
I also think that you should encourage people to create a secure, alternative wallet, assuming that you designed your service to be the middleman of wallets. Could prevent a few outcries over lost BTC here and there in the future :) (instawallet, hint hint)
I know that this is in the starting phases, but I'll definitely use your service.
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:43:33
You can create an account on  or  Of course, the safest would be an offline/paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:13:40
This post cheered me up a bit. On one hand, I want the bubble to burst, but on the other, I'm dubious about buying right now.
The safest thing to do is sit back and watch it either grow to the skies or burst like a birthday balloon.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:41:21
Well, but why not?
The sane part of this community is just watching(and more importantly, keeping the money to themselves) and the more uneducated part is getting an expensive lesson. Besides that, it makes for great laughs during the evening, it did for me at least.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:28:39
Haha. They also released an OC version of the card which was basically the same, except for the clocks. I guess it's safe to assume that it's safe to overclock to OC's clocks.
*so many clocks*

...and a bit of a backstory: 
@_date: 2013-09-12 12:24:54
Somewhat offtopic, but seems like you're using a wide angle lens - mind sharing any details? ;)
@_date: 2013-09-11 14:49:20
Both of us can't prove either side of the story definitively, there's no point making factual assumptions based on opinions. You know very well that you are taking a risk when ordering a paper wallet, essentially pre-printed for you.

"Experience from competition: 1st generation late 2013"
Who are you kidding?
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:26:52
Sort of an ELI5 question - if you were to be tracked, wouldn't your email give you away? It'd link to all the activity if they could get the IP from the service provider. I can imagine it being a tough process, but I doubt they'd say "oh it's too hard to obtain it, we can't find this guy". All of this would happen IF you registered your email(s) from your home, though.
Not sure if I'm missing something and being silly.
@_date: 2013-07-26 22:14:19
Instead of ordering BFL rigs for which you have to wait in line for who knows how long, go on bitcointalk.org, buy yourself Avalon chips from a group buy and buy yourself a custom made rig. There are different groups based on your location(Europe, US and so on).
An example: 
...and a handy chart:

Oh, alright. Thanks for the info, I was somewhat concerned for a second.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:24:51
You'd be better off trying to convince smaller sites like DealExtreme first.

That's what I wanted to hear, too. I'm glad you're not one of those "it's cool to leave European countries out and only sell to NA and Asia" type of guys. :)
I look forward to this coming to life, might buy one, too!

Yeah. Too bad that many people haven't seen this.

Glad to see something being engineered in Europe since, being European myself, Bitcoin itself isn't as known in Europe as it is in other parts of the world.

At first, I thought "tips" as in advice, but this works, too. Happy cakeday, fellow Redditor!

[I'm not able to subscribe to the latest job listings.]( (by clicking "Subscribe" under "Submit a Job") 
Not exactly sure why "job seeker" and "employer" are capitalized, either.
Edit: wrote "employer" capitalized myself...
Edit 2: Now that I've thought about freelancer.com - why not have the ability to upload progress to your employer(if it's a computer-based, over-the-Internet type of job, like data entry) via the website?

Hey. I'm running a 2GB Sapphire 7850 at 53C with 50% fan speed and I'm getting the same issue. Just figured out I'd respond in case you'd found a solution to this.

Google Chrome - I've included a picture as well.
What I meant was more along the lines of uploading your work to the site, eliminating the need of resorting to another website for the files separately.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:00:00
Technically, it really can't. But if it does one day, I shall eat my hat and buy a shitload of coins, waiting for a bubble like this in the very distant future.
