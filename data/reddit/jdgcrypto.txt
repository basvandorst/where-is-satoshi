Doesn't look like it. Apart from Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold almost all alts are down as well. Strange how that goes. Everyone freaking out now that BTC goes down?

Sounds like a terrible idea for a number of reasons. 
1. If you did not think it was a good idea to sell BTC at 15 or 10K why do you think it is a good idea now at 7K? Makes no sense at all.
2. The bottom of BTC was at USD 6000. Now it is rebounding from 6600. This could well be a higher bottom. Certainly looking at the candle stick that is forming today, the chance you sell at the lowest point is much greater than the chance that BTC drops through the 6000 USD support level.
3. Trying to time the bottom is expensive. The only way to do it is to be on top of your computer all day. Likelyhood is you get out now, you look again a day later, or the next morning, and BTC is back at 9000. This is how fast recoveries tend to go. I do not have the time and energy to be on top of the price 24/7 to avoid buying back more expensive.
4. With regulation on the way, more and more institutional investors are looking at cryptos. For instance the 500M crypto hedgefund of Mark Yusko. But many others big players, including Blackrock are preparing to invest in bitcoin and possibly other cryptos. Once they get in it is going to go crazy. This could start tomorrow, next week, next month or in June or so. I am not risking missing the boom or having to buy back higher.
In short, if you believe BTC has no future. Sell now. If you think it has, this is a time to buy, not to sell.
In January it was a good time to sell. The basics of investing continue to be the same: buy low, sell high. Not the opposite.

Why do you think more downside is likely?
I think more upside is likely after the correction we had and just above the bottom of early February (USD 6000). 
Yes it COULD go lower, but it is quite likely we have seen the bottom.
By selling at the bottom and buying back higher you make a loss!

I just saw a Dutch TV programme about a Dutch town where merchants changed to accept BTC because of the fees banks charge for being able to accept digital payments. Quite a few of them simply stopped having the ATM machine and told clients that for non cash payments they needed to pay with BTC.
Small innovative developments that sure will be followed by others in the next years, such as several airports throughout the world are already doing. Interesting!
