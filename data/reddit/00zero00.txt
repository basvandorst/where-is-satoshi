You need to report your gains. You can report your losses, but if it's not significant then don't bother. [I asked about this yesterday](

How though? If my wallet is offline on a USB stick somewhere, how could someone hack it apart from actually stealing the stick itself?

I want to buy coins via Bitstamp. How trustworthy are they with regards to personal information? They are asking for a lot of information.

Is that now the typical network fee to send bitcoins from Coinbase to my wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:38:38
I still don't really understand the differences between different cryptocurrencies and their respective benefits. Im still researching. But yeah, my point is I don't believe fiat currency will go anywhere as the value of goods and services are already set by the dollar, including bitcoins. Unless every economy switches their currency to cryptocurrency, I think bitcoins will just be another commodity. And given that only a select few individuals possess most of the bitcoins, it doesn't actually seem useful. Maybe the best method to distribute cryptocurrency would have to originate from a central source with a huge amount of coins already available for trade.

So I should ignore the forks then? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:44:16
Exactly. Bitcoin is very poorly diversified. If bitcoin isn't used as a currency, then it is no different than gold. And why should I use bitcoins as currency if litecoin is cheaper?

What if I set up an electrum wallet on a USB stick. Transfer my coins to my wallet, and then unplug my USB stick? If I want to sell bitcoins, then I just plug the stick back in. How is that different from a hardware wallet? Ease of use?

All of my bitcoins are in Coinbase. How can I claim the upcoming forks?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:01:47
Got it. Thank you. I dont have that much on CB, I just want to make sure my coins are secure. I guess there is no need to rush :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:01
The odds of that happening would be very low though. The hacker would need to target me specifically at the very point in time where I am setting up my wallet. Unless electrum also comes with malware, nobody is checking me out. They would need to hack electrum directly but all they would retrieve is encrypted nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:19
Yeah, that is my biggest concern. I fear that bitcoin will at some point crash hard because the income inequality would be so vast that no one would actually be using bitcoin for its purpose. Why buy and use bitcoins if there aren't enough bitcoins to go around? It is not really a decentralized currency if a handful of people control the entire economy. If they cash out, then its game over. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:05:47
Oh man that is tedious haha. The thing is I dont think I have invested enough to justify spending so much for a hardware wallet, but I want to keep my coins secure indefinitely. If Bitcoins explodes then ill use some of that to buy a hardware wallet. Otherwise I think an electrum wallet is safe enough. The number one prevention against malware is user intelligence, so as long as I am vigilant I dont think anyone will hack me. If someone makes a hardware wallet at less than half the price of the current models, then ill definitely buy one. Thanks!

What about all the miners and bitcoin millionaires? These people own significant percentages of bitcoins and therefore hold significant power over the bitcoin economy. Wouldn't we be just transferring power from the bankers to them? What is the distribution of bitcoins held by individuals? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:08
Oh ok. How would they be monitoring my keystrokes though? Through a third party virus or though electrum itself?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:51
I know that there is a miner's fee for sending bitcoins from Coinbase (for example) to a personal wallet. Is that a percentage of the amount of bitcoins you want to transfer? If it is a fixed rate, then what is the smallest amount I can transfer before spending more money on fees than on the actual transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:32:00
I am just going to use electrum and save that wallet on a USB stick. I dont plan on selling anything until next year anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:04:02
Is there a particular time generally where congestion isn't as high? I heard that there was an update going through that will make transactions quicker. Has that been implemented? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:53
I don't plan on selling my coins for another year. If I just transfer my coins to electrum and store that wallet on a USB stick, and not touch it for a year, what would be the possibility of me getting hacked (apart of physically losing the stick itself)? Could someone hack electrum and gain access to my wallet despite it being offline on a USB stick?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:42
How do I do it when I put them in my wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:37:54
Huh. Well, I dont really do much on my computer that would attract malware, but you never know. Is there a way to set up a USB stick to be as secure as a hardware wallet? They are so expensive.

I have coins in Coinbase that I want to move to a wallet. Should I just transfer them now or would it be better to wait until lightning is properly implemented? I read that transferring them to GDAX and then sending them to a wallet would decrease fees, but the ID verification process is taking forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:17:39
What if I place my electrum wallet on a clean USB stick? How does cold storage compare to a hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:42:39
Yeah, I am not planning on selling anytime soon. I bought in for the fun of it to see how far this can go. I am just wondering if my purchase will be a problem when filing my taxes. It seems that if I buy and hold onto it indefinitely, then I don't have to report anything.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:45:17
Thanks! I understand that the IRS does not see bitcoins as legal tender. If, and when, I use bitcoins to purchase a product, do I need to report anything? Or is the sales tax sufficient. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:54:40
Wonderful. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:29:32
Hypothetically, if I sell at a loss, do i have to report it? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:01:47
I purchased $300 worth of bitcoin. How do I declare this when filing my taxes? Do I declare it if I don't sell?
EDIT: [bitcoin.tax]( looks like a good resource
