From running it myself, I would say it's no more difficult than running a game server. 
The running cost of a node is smaller than the cost of a game server back in 2000. 
   
A raspberry-Pi lightning node funded with £30 with of bitcoin is within the grasp of teenagers.

You can get wallets to ignore that. Or you could make the first transaction first and not broadcast it and keep it in a text file and broadcast it later.  
Actually maybe it's a good idea to make that transaction now, an emergency 2000sat/byte tx that spends all your funds to a cold wallet. You could keep it in a script or batch file on your desktop, all you'd need to do is double click it and boom your funds are safe.

There are 100's of "altcoins" that have the exact same code as bitcoin. 
BCH is one of those many altcoins.    
The unique(ish) feature of BCH is that when it was created it had a copy of Bitcoin ledger, instead of creating a new one, meaning everyone who had bitcoin also had BCH, so they got "airdropped" free money.   
  
Here is a list of the other "fork coins" that also copied the bitcoin ledger.   
  
  
They all have variations, 8mb blocs, 4mb bloks, new proof of works, etc. 
I personally think all of these fork coins are not worth looking at. Bitcoin has many great developers behind it, most of the "fork"-coins are 1-2 people trying to make a quick buck. There are other more novel alt-coins that offer unique features.   
If you want to invest, I would recommend reading up on types of crypto currencies and find one's that are different to bitcoin and offer something unique. If bitcoin fails, then all it's clones will fail for the same reason. Ethereum, Monero, Grin, Holochain are very different to Bitcoin, if bitcoin fails they might succeed in it's place.

Wow, this person Hodled even at gunpoint. /Hatsofftoyou.

SW increased the max block size to 4mb, for a while we have had 1.05mb blocks, recently we got some 1.2mb, 1.4mb and this fat 2.2mb block. 
A few companies are taking advantage of the extra space, meaning cheaper transaction fees for everyone.

Wallets need a new transaction batching UI. 
I should be able to select "new batch" then "add" transactions to it.   
Followed by "save and close" or "Save, close and send if fees are low".  
Later when I have a new transaction to add I'll open my batched tx, add the new recipient and amount and close it again.   
That way I can save up my (non time critical) tx's over the course of the month and then send when I have 5-10 together. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:22:29
You are describing something unimaginable (like internet), that is also a complex and technical solution to money - something which is very poorly understood.  
  
It's better to focus on some aspect of crypto that the person you are talking to is interested in and talk to them about that.  
An example could be talking about having a clear trackable system for verifying the source of Manuka honey, to someone who works in a whole foods store - instead of talking about wiping out the banks with maths. 
Also, and I don't mean to be rude here, you yourself might not have a good understanding of Bitcoin. Exuberance alone won't be enough to overcome people's scepticism. In many cases saying how amazing something is will only increase people's wearyness towards it.

*"So I guess you're just investing in a couple records on that database that prove you have "money"? And simultaneously betting that everyone will continue to host that database right?"*
In the example I'm giving, Bitcoin as a platform, it's not "money" it's an access token. Buying access tokens is investing in that people will want access to the underlying resource.
*"So I guess each distributed database + network of people agreeing to run the associated software to maintain it make up a "website" if we were comparing this to the internet?"* 
Yes exactly, owning BTC tokens is like owning the cables / servers that serve the internet, so "websites" pay you to access those reources. It's like being a AT&amp;T. 
"So basically that network of people and database are the product, and anyone can create their own network and database and those are the altcoins? Correct?" 
Yes, and if you think of them as a service, you can see why 99% of them are useless. Bitcoin is Trustnet, you only need one of those. Ethereum is Virtual-Machine net. Filecoin is Data-Storage-net. 
Owning BTC, Eth and Filecoin gives you access to, distributed trust,  virtual contracts and data hosting. 
  
A business that sells holiday homes and allows people to rent holiday homes would pay FileCoin to host it's website, Eth to run it's code, and bitcoin to store property title deeds.   
I think it's worth "investing" in some tokens as a store of value, as they are goods that will be needed in the future. Like Salt, or iron tacks.

No, because only one transaction will get confirmed. That's why 0-conf transactions are not safe to use. In fact even 1 confirmation is not enough for larger values.

If you made a transaction and broadcasted it, it will go  through and send your coins to the new location.   
You won't need to wait for the chain to sync.  
Your transaction is probably waiting in the mempool, there is a long queue for transactions to be processed so it might take more than 6 hours to get your transaction included in a block.

A con of using a finite currency like Bitcoin or Gold is the volatility of the price of goods, like you said.  
It may not be as problematic as in the past as our population is certainly not going to have a 10 fold explosion.  
 
Once bitcoin is fully adopted the demand won't increase as much as when gold was a the backing currency.  
We can also issue currencies backed by bitcoin, which allows us to create money with some leverage. This will allow us to meet the demand for more money if there is ever growth in money needs.   
It's unlikely that bitcoin will be the sole currency. National currencies will be around for a very long time, and I expect another "Stable coin" will emerge (be it a national currency, crypto currency, or some kind of token of basket-of-assets). This "stable coin" would be the globally recognized Unit of account.  
Remember that crypto currency allows for a degree of inter-currency-frangibility never seen before. It's very likely you will buy goods using one currency and the shop would receive another currency. Neither you or the shopkeep would know or care that that is the case. *Even if you personally use bitcoin for every purchase you make, there is no reason for you to see prices in bitcoin*

In a transaction you can send from multiple (n) inputs to to multiple outputs. So you can have 1 input that pays 3 outputs or 3 inputs that pay 1 output.  
Yes it is possible for the inputs to be owned by different people.  
Yes it's possible for the outputs to be owned by different people.
There are some transactions that may include coins from 10 people being paid to 20 people (10 recipients + change for senders). This is what transaction batching is.

Yes, you can achieve this with a multi-sig account where the co-signer always signs the transaction, but after a 48 hour delay. 
I think Greenaddress offers some features like this. 
Obviously keep your private key in a safety deposit box(s). Then your "warm" wallet on a time lock, so you can't withdraw it all in a single transaction.  
Using time-lock + secure deposit box seems to be a good balance between having to make a trip to the bank to make a transaction versus having millions of $ in your house to be stolen.

It's completely unknown what we will end up with. One thing that is certain (baring apocalyptic scenarios) is that physical cash will be gone very soon. Whether the future is digital fiat, or crypto currency is still up in the air.  
   
We will probably see at least one country issue a state currency backed by Bitcoin. 
I don't know legal situations well enough to know if a private bank will issue it's own bitcoin-backed currency (this is how currencies used to be made)    
  
Bitcoin might make national currencies "behave" more. Consider the effect of the Euro on it's member nations, Greece and Itally in particular. Some countries, having lost the ability to print behave more responsibly. Other countries did not control spending, and went bankrupt rapidly without the "print money" button.   
Bitcoin could have the same effect as Euro on every nation in the world. We'll see what countries become more responsible with spending :).
Another thing to consider is national banks are already making their own crypto style currencies. The Bank of England is supposedly launching theirs this year. I'll be interested to see how it works.
  
As for my speculations of the future: I think some countries will go bust and end up using the national-crypto of countries like England / Switzerland. Bitcoin will replace gold as the "store of value" - while also acting as an international payment network. I think there will be 1000's of crypto currencies and utility tokens that are also used alongside national crypto's and bitcoin. Either a national currency or some crypto basket token will become the global "unit of account" currency. Whether it's used or not.

I disagree with this article. 
**Casual** users won't be interested in maintaining a node, but hobbyists and dedicated users will be as well as profit seeking individuals.  
In the early 2000's there was a thriving ecosystem of game servers run by communities and individuals. That was without financial benefit.   
Running a lightning node will be simpler and provide a bit of income, I think there will be more than enough users who will build up the network themselves.

For a company you would use a HSM (Hardware security module) which is essentially a very big hardware wallet for a corporation that has multiple keys / passwords / RFID keyfobs. (Ledger are currently producing these, I don't know if they are on the market yet)  
In addition to a HSM, private keys would be stored in multiple parts across several vaults.  
There is a documentary floating around for Xapo (I think) on how they store their wallets in x-cold-war-base bank vaults. 
Personally if I had billionz. I would split my funds into multiple wallets and split the up seed words into multiple parts and store them in very secure vaults. (Splitting means you need to raid multiple vaults to assemble a full key, if one vault is destroyed you are still able to produce the full key from others.   
E.g. Key = ABC, you have 3 parts AC, AB, CB, and store them in 3 vaults, any 2 gives you the full key.  
I would store some wallets in other countries. And of course I would also use a regular old HW wallet for regular amounts of money.

Depends on your country, you should state where you live for a region specific question.   
Typically you don't have to do anything. It's the same as if you sold a car or painting. In the UK you have a £11,500 capital gains tax allowance, so you don't owe any tax unless you make more than £11,500. After which you get charged 20% your gain.

You can't write it off as an expense. Your company will have it as a capital asset. If you buy £10,000 worth of your computers, your company owns £10,000 worth of computers and could sell them. What you can do is write off the **depreciation** as an expense. (The amount the asset declines in value by each year). 
You still have to pay CGT (capital gains tax) on the increase in value of bitcoin inside your business, and pay tax to extract the money as income.    
Mining as an individual will also means your bitcoin get taxed as income.   
This actually gets complicated...typically retaining income in the business is more tax efficient, but because bitcoin increases in price so much you might pay less tax earning it as an individual.  It also depends on when you extract the money from the business.   
  
You'll need to make a spreadsheet to calculate which route is most tax efficient.

SegWit (Segregated witness) is a softfork that enables blocks to go above 1mb. This is done by separating part of the transaction out (known as the witness) and storing it in a seperate area in the block (one of the leaf nodes of the merkle tree).     
Data that goes in the witness part of the block gets discounted at a 4:1 ratio. So if a block was all witness data it would be 4mb. A typical full block would be 1.7mb-2.2mb.    
Because of the way it has been designed, transactions that combine inputs are cheaper than one's that create more outputs. This has a benefits of incentivising people to keep the UTXO set (Unspent transaction outputs ) smaller.   
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:03:08
It's a strange concept, but Bitcoin is distributed infrastructure. If you consider Bitcoin to be a "Trustnet" that requires BTC tokens to gain access to it, if you own BTC tokens, you own access rights to Trustnet.    
Running your own node and owning BTC tokens is like owning a chunk of a business that owns the infrastructure. The difference is, instead of owning a business that owns the infrastructure, you just directly own the infrastructure yourself.  
Many businesses operate by storing data in the block chain. In order store their data, business must by access tokens from you.  
   
This is what is meant by "permissionless". Literally anyone can roll up and run a part of bitcoin.

They are not over exaggerated and I have looked into it in some detail. The cost of a full node is not my only concern.  
**As a quick list off the top of my head:**  
*UTXO bloat,*   
*O^n network bandwidth scaling issue,*  
*Premature (pre optimized) blockchain bloat,*  
*Concerns for Node operation on home internet (your webserver option is not acceptable for me),*  
*Single hardfork vs multiple hardforks* *(A hardfork should introduce an algorithm that allows the blocksize to scale henceforth, instead a single increase, which would require more forks, and also come with other fixes, header changes etc),*  
*Increasing (or preventing a decrease) in full nodes,*  
*A method of safe Hardfork deployment,*  
    
It's a simple list of concerns I have. If you have an article to link or are able to write one yourself addressing these points, I'll be happy to go over it with you. I want bigger blocks yesterday, but I'm not willing to risk these issues for bigger blocks now.

used to be an alternative forum about bitcoin, and then it go co-opted by the bitcoin-cash crowd, so it's not even an alternative place to discuss bitcoin anymore.  
BCH, is one of 100's of alt coins that share the same code as bitcoin, but it's the only one that as one of it's main "road map goals" is to take the name of bitcoin.  
It makes a really unpleasant experience on the forums to have constant streams of abusive posts and outright lies / misinformation. I'm not claiming that other forums, bitcoiners themselves don't also do this, every forum has it's assholes, but there is a greater-than-normal amount of abusive content coming from BCH fans(*) than I normally experience.  
  
(*) This abusive content is not necessarily coming from BCH fans, at this point I expect it's paid bots and shills - possibly even from a third party not related to BCH and BTC.

**1a)** These units are divisible to 8 decimal places it is not limited at all (2.3x^6 units per person, if there are 9 billion people) . One of the problems of deflationary currencies is they cease to function when the value rises beyond which you can sensibly divide them. (For instance you used to pay 10 gold coins for an item, now it's only worth half a gold coin, before that point is reached another currency would be used)   
  
**1b)** The amount lost would be negligible. Even if it came to 30% of the total supply over 100 years, we could add another 6 decimal places increasing the supplyby a factor of a million.   
  
**2)** The volitilty will decline over time. It is currently volatile because less than 3% of people use Bitcoin. A 1% addition means huge swings in price. When we have near saturation ~60%, a 1% addition will go un-noticed.     
  
**3)** There are already numerous fixes for this in the pipeline.   
  
**4)** SegWit is not the only fix on it's way. We have Schnorr, MAST, Bech32 addresses, Lightning Network (plus all the layers that creats), Liquid, Block size increases, Rootstock, Mimble Wimble and there will be many more things coming in the next decade.   
  
**5)**  No, it's already being used differently to gold. People use Bitcoin as a Trustnet for proofs, proof of existence, peg other databases to it and for property title deed ownership. Bitcoin has many features that are not just about being gold, or digital gold.

The lightning payments are bitcoin transactions, you just don't broadcast them to the blockchain. No one can "steal" a coin, it's still trustless. 
Lightning is just an alternative way of handling transactions - in essence e-gold (bitcoin) "transactions" are like getting the gold weighed, which you have to wait 10 minutes for. Lightning is like a 1 ounce minted coin, you don't have to weigh it you can accept it at face value. If you are ever worried, you can always get the coin "weighed" the old fashioned way.

I need more detail than a single line on each point. For example for the first one: Larger blocks increase UTXO bloat not decrease it. If I'm wrong I need some numbers...
    
And the last bullet point, they aren't scalability issues, but they are practical issues for implementing scaling fixes, for example you mention "one-time" increase. A one time block increase is **not** acceptable to me.   
  
I'v put forward those points because they are reasons I won't run the code, if they aren't taken into consideration, then it won't change my stance.

Block-Fi has the business model of fiat to bitcoin loans for businesses. Argento to be a competitor?
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:26:40
Their main business is Fiat loans with bitcoin as collateral. 
The risk to their business is if the price of bitcoin crashes too rapidly for them to recover assets through selling collateral (bitcoin). 
The new business they have is the reverse, where they lend bitcoin to businesses who deposit fiat as collateral. It's your bitcoin that they lend out, and you are getting a piece of that interest rate. **Since this is the reverse bet of the rest of their business it lowers their business risk.**. 
If the price of bitcoin rises, the risk is on the businesses that borrowed the bitcoin, not on BlockFi (aka your balance sheet). And in theory it would also mean an increase in Fiat loans on the other side of the business. 
I would otherwise be really skeptical of anything offering interest rates in BTC denominations. Usually BTC denominated loans means defaults and loss of your invested capital when there's an extreme upward price movement. In theory BlockFi makes money if bitcoin goes up lots, if bitcoin stays the same, and if bitcoin goes down lots.

Sorry I didn't explain what I meant.  
Lightning increases the use-cases of bitcoin. 
I currently do maybe 1 transaction  per month. If I could pay for everything with bitcoin I would be making hundreds of transactions per month - which would result in mybe 6-10 tx's on chain.    
If everyone starts using lightning, we'll get many more transactions done in bitcoin at very high efficiency, but we would still increase the number of on-chain transactions overall.

Short answer: The speed of light.
Block propagation around the globe takes time. The larger the network is geographically the longer it takes to converge on a consensus - and the more orphaned blocks are generated.    
The 10 minute block interval is a trade off between efficiency security and convenience. If we had miners on the moon our block time would need to be larger to account for the increased network delay.  
  
Other coins might have faster blocks, but you have to wait as long for the same level of security. For large transfers 6 blocks in bitcoin is considered to be safe, 6 litecoin blocks is not safe, you have to wait for ~1h worth of blocks for it to be safe.

Also remember that coins are mined, bitcoin has had a about 15% inflation rate for many many years, since last year this has dropped alot with the block reward halving.   
Coins are always being distributed to new people.  
Bitcoin isn't about redistributing wealth. It's a method of giving a banking and finance infrastructure to people who couldn't have it before. There's 2 billion un-banked people in the world. When bitcoin is ready, it's going to be able to serve those people.

It'll work like this:
I go to my bitcoin buying website I receive 20 bits in my wallet. 
If I don't already have a lightning channel open I can open one now. This takes 20 minutes for 2 confirmations.   
If I do have a channel the 20 bits go straight into my lightning  wallet.  
  
Now when I'm out, I go to a coffee shop for breakfast and I can pay them 0.5 bits instantly, I have 19.5 bits left on my channel.  
Next I can go shopping, buy items in lots of different shops, an ice cream. I'm down to 11.1 bits.
I meet a friend who owes me for dinner last night, they give me 1 bit. I have 12.5 bits. 
I want to buy an gift for 15 bits - I can go to the nearest BTM and top up with another 5 bits. I now have 17.5 bits and I can make the purchase.
The 2 transactions at the start/end allow me to make *dozens or hundreds of thousands of transactions*. The scale factor is now 2tx's (or 700 bytes) per N transactions. Instead of 255 bytes per transaction.

I think "world wide adoption" would not necessarily mean 100% replacement of a nations native currency. If the usage of Bitcoin is as widespread as the use of smart phones you'd have 200-500 million users. 
So valuing Bitcoin would need to be based on that number of people using it.
Remember that lots of people still don't use the internet. 
My guess at value would be £150k per BTC ($300k) based on 500m users having a portion of their money in BTC. This is my interpretation of "world wide" adoption.

So am I - that is "passporting" - before passporting became popular websites used to request passwords so they could log in to your account to get the details automatically for you. 
I'm not saying that passwords were gained from using passporting. I'm saying websites used to get passwords - not by faking the google login, but just straight up requesting passwords for a service. Yes - you would have been a fool to use such a service.

I use several methods. I'm a hobbyist - so consider a market analysis would do what im doing but many layers deeper. At present I have a very big spreadsheet for this.
1) Weighted matrix. List of events and possible numbers of users with the chance that that scenario will happen. This gives an "Average" value of the BTC given the chance it fails or flies and all scenarios in between. (I get ~£11,000 from this)
2) I wanted a "UK only" price since I have lots of data on UK finance etc. Basically I have taken the average savings of all individuals, cut out the individuals that probably wont use BTC (Only 87% of people in the UK use internet, even less use smart phones) and then use a portion of that money to be the value of BTC. (~£7000 from that) 
I'm trying to dig up more information on individuals use of money. As most estimates I have seen have been a % of some market caps of other financial things. Bitcoin - in its best case scenario will not be used by everybody. Drop box has 100m users. Facebook is 1000m. I think BTC will be between those two points.
At present I get a value of £90-£200 for the current value of bitcoin. This will rise as more people use it.

It does not. It means while I expect that BTC would become a mainstream it is not guaranteed and at the price specified I've already "won" so no need to gamble further.

It's a currency, so it's value doesn't change much, but the unit of account of each bitcoin increases.
Pretend bitcoins are checkbooks and there are only 10 checkbooks. If you want to send more money at a time, you have to write down bigger numbers on the checkbook.
  
With traditional (fiat) currencies (£ and $) the central banks create more checkbooks in-line with demand for usage, so the "unit of account" remains the same.

I'm basing this on the fact that there are slightly less than 1m BTC addresses that hold a non-dust ballance. 1m users is an overestimation since many addresses can be owned by one person. Also AFAIK, coinbase accounts are linked to BTC wallets so they would be included in the above estimate.

I don't think it works like that. I think the more weak keys you put in the more "edges" you give for people to fish data out of your signature. 
There's an idea discussed in this podcast about common bits. How having a few bits in a key with common ranges gives a possible way to reveal the key from a signature. 
Also be aware that there are projects set up to find bitcoin addresses and take the money. They are all equally difficult to find in either address schema to use.

There is a lot of stuff going on there. 
Last year there was a lot of pressure put large wallets to batch transactions to save space on the blockchain.  
From where your arrow starts, exchanges started to batch transactions, not all at once, but over the course of that year. 
Most transactions before 2017 were not batched and now after 2018 many of them are batched so this graph is hiding a lot of extra transactions.
You need to compare this graph with the total outputs graph to get a better view.

It depends on how the split works. If you have a 50:50 split to Fork A and Fork B with an incompatible transaction format (Pretend both fork A and B are incompatible with the orginal fork O), the Lightning network will probably get replicated on Fork A and B by also making the LN communication incompatible LNA, LNB, then you could copy and paste your LN directory into the LNA/B client and continue using your coins (which would need to be split)  
I don't think that case is likely.
IMO, the more likely case; A majority fork O (original) and minor fork V (vestigial). The lightning network would continue to operate on chain O. Your channels on chain V would close and you would retain the same balance as on chain O, but you would not have use of the lightning network.

Mimble Wimble is a different protocol, the most important difference being that it is an interactive protocol, which requires both parties to be online to send or receive a transaction. 
When I first heard of it people were talking about making it a side chain of bitcoin. If it were part of bitcoin I guess it would be kind of like the lightning network, a parallel system that adds new features but isn't directly part of the base layer. 
Mimble Wimble doesn't hide addresses - the tx format allows you to condence the history of A paying B paying C etc into A-&gt;Z, shrinking the blockchain massively and ensuring fungibility and privacy.

2) Printing is an option of last (well not quite last) resort, just the fact that the option exists is enough to secure the loan. Think of it like a colatoralized loan. 
Your right that they could print money fast enough to undermine the faith in the dollar, but that's a long way off from what is happening.

I run a node that verifies transactions that come on to the network.  
Nodes verify transactions, miners provide security.  Miners get compensated for the security they provide with block rewards.  
You can't replace this with a pre-existing system as the decentralized mining feature solves the Byzantine generals problem. An algorithm that allows trust in information given by people trying cheat to cheat.  
Now using maths we can prove if someone has a digital asset or not, this is immensely valuable. That is what bitcoin provides.

No we aren't sacrificing network usability for small blocks. Network usability is being maintained by having small blocks. You are over simplifying the problem it's not just a matter of downloading 144mb a day from a fixed server.  
  
 - Blocks need propagate around the globe.
 - Multiple blocks at the same height can be found, nodes need all of them.
 - Nodes need to be able to download and upload blocks within their daily / monthly / annual usage limits.  
 - The network needs to remain synchronized.

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:36:00
That is incorrect. It's basically a block extension. A full SegWit block is ~2.2mb in size, but some of the data is "outside" of the standard block data. The SW block can be serialized as a regular 1mb block for old nodes and as 2.2mb block for SW nodes.   
There's some clever shenanigans with how much data is allowed outside of the standard block. The witness discount makes it slightly cheaper to make TX/s that leave fewer UTXO's behind. The maximum block size is 4mb, but that is unlikely.

While hailed like Jesus, Satoshi was an ordinary person (and a not-so-great coder) who probably didn't realize BTC would be worth so much like all the other crypto-nerds at the time.
The 1m coins are based on time he or she did mining - it's not certain it's assumed by activity. There are lots of 50 btc addresses associated with Satoshi that have never moved. Likewise there are many 50btc addresses owned by others too...who probably lost their harddrives etc. 
Even if Satoshi still had the private keys for each of those wallets it would be foolish to touch them, I say this seriously - it's likely they would be kidnapped and tortured by whichever nation got them first to get the coins. A huge amount of BTC posses a risk to nations.

The price of bitcoin is based on the supply. 
While people say "16 million coins in circulation" that is not actually the case. 2 million are considered to be **dead** (this includes Satoshi's estimated 1m) and a further 1m.  
Really we are looking at 14 million coins in circulation. If 1 satoshi is spent from the pile of 1 million coins that drastically alters the value proposition of a single Bitcoin. 
Edit: Dead coins are coins where the private key has been lost. Making the Bitcoin un-recoverable.

Your are treating this as some binary event of printed and not printed. Ecconomies already have a sweet spot of slow currency erosion that people don't mind or notice. I don't know the Fed's specific policies, but in the UK the Bank of England has a mandate to maintain 2% inflation. This wipes £40bn of the UK debt balance per year. If the US did the same that would be $400bn wiped off per year - this is without using the generated money to pay down the debt.

in PoS for token "x" you pledge some x to maintain the security of x. If you have the majority of x's you can change the rules to benefit you (like give yourself more x's). 
These vulnerabilities lasts forever, if at any point a private key held most of the x's, you could could sell that private key even if it's currently empty, because it can on it's own re-write the block history!
In PoS you often can't tell if someone has a majority or not.  
In PoW for "Y"'s you have to stake electricity to secure "y". If someone owns a lot of Y they can't effect the rules.  In order to buy a lot of electricity you have to give up resources.

If that's what I'm thinking, that allows the node to decide whether to download the full block or not - helps when there is orphaning. I think at the end of the day if SW produces a 3mb block a full node has to digest that 3mb block at some point.

Because anyone could write what they wanted. You have to assume someone will write a client to cheat the system. 
This issue happens in multiplayer computer games. People write game clients to cheat, giving them extra currency, aim bot etc. The solution is to not trust the clients, having what is called a "server authoritative" approach where a single central server makes all the decisions. If you don't trust a central server...you need to decentralize.
In order to make bitcoin decentralized, each node trusts the longest chain of the most work. Since every block is made from the last block, if you insert a new block you have to change every block after it. To change every block means re-doing all the work that was previously done to make that chain. This is quite close to impossible as you have to have significantly more computing power than the entire network in order to edit the transaction history. 
Currently 6,350,641,226 GH/s  or about 500,000 mining computers.

Gold has physical properties that make it valuable as a medium of exchange. 
Bitcoin has the same properties as gold, better in many cases (but does require computers).  
It doesn't need to be "backed" by gold. It has the same fundamentals that make it valuable.  
Fiat currencies without gold backing, require trust in the central issuer. If your central issuer is the Bank of England, you are probably in good hands. If it's the Venezuelan government then you are probably already having a rough time.

You don't know who the receiver is. They don't actually touch the coins until they spend them.  
You don't have your own ledger, you have the entire ledger. You spend coins to an address, the transaction is validated by the

As the receiver you can validate the transaction, but it needs to be mined to go into a block to be added to the global ledger.

To 1) If you need the money immediately you can close the channel any time to recuperate it. Also this risk is not specific to LN it's one that comes with the crypto territory (fortunatly it's mostly been in the favour of the hodler)
2) It's instant. I don't see how this can happen. Especially as you can take multiple routes.
3) You only need to have a single connection to be connected to the entire network. 
As an addition, the block size **will** get increased at some point in the future - that will keep fee's sensible. Onboarding / offboarding 500m user requires more than 1mb of block space.

The energy spent by the network is the block reward - this is one of the defining features of bitcoin. 
The coin emission rate is currently 52,000 coins or 4.5% of aggregate coin value. 30bn at ~$2000 / coin has a roughly 11TWH/y energy consumption. If the price went to $20,000, 300bn aggregate value, then the energy consumption would rise to 111 TWH/y.
One way to reduce this is to make quarter of the blocks PoS instead of proof of work. 1/4 of the coin emission would be paid to stakes instead of energy burning (the work part). You could change this to any proportion of course, e.g. 99 PoS blocks to 1 PoW block 
  
If 1/4 of the blocks are PoS, then 13,140 coins would go to stakes and 39,420 coins would go to electricity (minus profit / operation costs). That's about a 25% energy saving.
    
LN will have little to no impact on this. If tx's move to LN, there will still be plenty of tx's in the main blocks. 
  
In 8 years the reward will have decreased by a factor of 4, dropping the emission to ~1.1% of the aggregate coin value and thus the energy consumption to the same factor. Hopefully this happens before coins hit $200,000 each.

Once you have signed a bitcoin transaction it is safe to give out. You can print it out as a barcode, send it over usb or SMS. 
It's like a cheque at this point.  All there needs to be a is a service that reads in the transaction and broadcasts it on their node. This is effectively how a hardware wallet works. It signs the tx inside it's own hardware then sends the transaction to your pc for your pc to send to the bitcoin network. 
Here's someone doing an example program to send transactions via SMS.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:54:53
In the simplest terms yes, but there's more than that. A single person would be able to single handedly crash the market, that creates more risk. Risk reduces the price. The effect on price would be much larger than 1/14th. If you are familiar with the concept of a bank run - where if lots of customers withdraw all their money at once the bank becomes insolvent. 1m coins under one person is like having a bank where one single person could cause a bank run.   
Another factor is that of the 14m coins in circulation many are locked up in different ways, be it individual hodler's or people using them in business. I think there's roughly 30% of that pool that circulates in and out of exchanges. The price of BTC is based off the supply that enters exchanges. That pool may only be 3-4m coins. The Gox coins (200,000) would have a massive impact on the price if they were all dumped at once. Just the threat of the satoshi wallet would dump the price too.

You have missunderstood belcher_'s post. *The number of nodes is not relevant* it is their activity that matters. If a significant portion of **economically active** nodes reject your transactions then you have problems.

CGT as normal. You pay tax on the increase in value above your "basis" value (how much you paid for them). You can choose to use First-In-Last-Out (you keep the price of each individual coin) or average price of all the coins as your basis price.  
Swapping between two crypto currencies counts as a taxable event. (If you do BTC -&gt; ETH it counts as doing BTC -&gt; £ -&gt; ETH, charging tax on your BTC gains).
If you buy stuff with your Bitcoins you have to pay CGT on that too, but if your just buying games on Steam don't worry about it, you'll be under the threshold. On the other hand if you buy a Tesla 3 for bitcoins, you will need to pay CGT on the £ value of the car.

It is decentralized, every user can run the mining software.   
The security is provided by solving a maths problem that is based on the previous block, which consumes a lot of cpu power - ultimately electricity. It's basically a trial and error problem, where a faster computer can try more combinations per second.   
The bitcoin network sets how difficult the problem is every 2 weeks, to ensure that *on average* the problem is solved every 10 minutes. That allows the miner to make the next block. The solution is difficult to create, but easy to prove. Every node verifies that a new block has validly solved the problem then the block is added to the chain.  
In order to cheat the bitcoin system and change a payment you made last week, you would have to come up with a whole new chain of blocks for that week that have valid solutions.  
Since nodes follow the longest valid chain, longest in in terms of work, thus electricity spent, you would have to burn and enormous amout of electricity in order to create a weeks worth of blocks to do your cheating transaction.  
While everyone can run the mining software, it is not profitable for everyone to run. Specific hardware has been designed to solve the "proof of work" problem that bitcoin has (Sha256) which are 1000's times faster than ordinary computers so it is not profitable, and solves a negligible amount of the problems. So only people who buy specialized mining hardware can "mine" bitcoin.

This actually happens fairly regularly. Two blocks can be found at the same time. As the block A spreads to nodes around the world, it will reach a node that already has block B. Block A will be rejected, but remembered because the node received B first. When the next block gets made C, if it was built on to B then A gets dropped and vice versa.   
The nodes will always follow the chain with the longest cumulative work.  
If someone made a whole bunch of "fake" blocks without doing the work, they would not be valid and those would be rejected by the network.

Bitcoin is like a boulder with thin leather straps attached to it. The miners, merchants, users, traders, businesses each hold a strap.  
If you tug on the boulder alone your strap will snap.
 
In order to move the boulder you need to get the others to tug in the same direction as you. 
Nodes don't rule, neither do the miners. Each group has a little bit of influence You only have power as long as you don't pull to hard on your strap!

That's true - I think it might be possible to do that in Lightning. That will be a question to ask the devs.
Another thing with the bitcoin fee, is it's the same fee for all transfers, whether buying a coffee or sending $35m to another country. Obviously the bitcoin fee is ludicrously small for the $35m transfer.  Germany recently paid $400m to move its gold from the US to Germany.

That is what is happening, mining was done on everyone computer. When someone "found" a block it was added to a chain. Everyone could verify that the block was correct. If the block was invalid it was rejected. 
The issue is dedicated mining hardware was invented that is 10,000 more efficient than home computers, so mining is done on dedicated hardware, but that is still distributed. 
Here's a video that gives a breakdown of how the distribution works and then goes in to a bit of detail on how mining (providing security) works.

The difference is that (currently) on the bitcoin network, the customer pays the fee instead of the supplier. You don't see the fees with debit and credit cards because these go to the suplier...except sometimes when you're buying less than £5/£10 worth of stuff and the shop charges you 25p.

**1) There will be many more off-chain options than just LN.**  
There will be many ways to interact with bitcoin, through side chains, layer 2 applications and custodied solutions. "on-chain" won't be a requirement. Ultimately all these solutions will still settle on to the main chain in a cost effective manner. We won't pay the fees individually we will pay them collectively. 
**2) The block reward can be raised**  
Controversial, but realistically if Bitcoin *is* used by everything as a core system and it needed a perpetual reward we would add it. Bitcoin operates today with a ~4% issuance per year. If we decide to perpetually emit 0.5% per year that would be fine. 
21 million is an arbitrary number (which we won't reach in your lifetime) and is already incorrect as we have lost around 4 million coins. I don't see perpetual issuance as a problem - *"only 21 million"* is rhetoric, nothing to do with practicalities of this software.   
**3) A backend system doesn't mean an un-used system**  
  
*"With no one willing to pay the hash rate costs, "*. Consumers may not pay block fees but the services that they use will be paying the fees on the bitcoin network.   
If bitcoin is useful and widely adopted then people will be paying the transaction fee. This sort of goes by definition, if bitcoin is useful it means people are getting value for the fees they pay.    
  
  
As a closing note I would say fees are going to be more than $40. I'm expecting it to get to ~$60 dollars in the next few years.  
As a bonus try calculating how big blocks need to be if you want to maintain a 5 sat/byte fee :).

The receiver does validate the transaction , this is essentially what happens whether they run a node or not. If you are receiving large sums you should run a node to personally verify them. 
The transaction is only complete when it gets included in a block - or what is known as a "confirmation". When the network confirms a transaction you know it's valid. Typically you wait for 6 confirmations to be totally sure. 
You can't trust the person sending you the transaction, and to a degree you can't trust the person receiving transactions either. The linked video covers why that is the case. Have a watch :).

SegWit **is** an upgrade to 2.2mb (max 4mb). The x2 doubles this to 4.4mb (8mb max). Undertaking a hardfork is not a thing to be done lightly. If we do hardfork we should fix other problems &amp; make the block size limit algorithmic so we don't have to hardfork again.   
In short: We are already going to get more confirming transactions per block.

They lend your bitcoin to businesses that want to borrow bitcoin with $ collatorized loans. I'd guess they charge ~11% to them.

You pay a fee to the exchange (Bakkt) for setting up the contract. I think a contract like that needs buyers on the other side (not unlimited supply). 
The buyer doesn't pay $21,400 now, they just get the *option* to have that price at the agreed upon date.  
The idea is that if the price in the future is $11,000, you are still able to sell at $21,000 at that future date allowing you to cover your bill. 
The other person is worried that the price might be too high for them to purchase, so they have the option to buy at $21,000, even if the price goes up to $42,000.

Of course that is a simplification. There is also speculation in the mix and people buying it out of hype (who have neither the intention to do transactions or store value).
Most importantly you have used the word "value" instead of price. The value and price are not the same thing. 
The value of bitcoin is much lower than the price. The value of it is the difference in ease of use, and richness of features between it and other competing mediums of exchange. 
"Tokens" are valuable because they represent goods. The "price" of a token is variable. Gold coins are a more valuable token than sea shells because of it's superior physical properties (robustness, supply, divisibility etc).

This is bullshit. 1mb blocks ended several years ago.  1.8mb block mined today. 
Lightning is also a decentralized network. In the first few minutes this person is saying you can force KYC in a particular client - you can't if it follows the BOLT protocol. Then they are saying Lightning is a company - it isn't, it's a protocol. There happens to be a company named after (similar to blockchain.io) which is one of several organisations working on lightning.    
This seems like deliberate misinformation.

Yeah, that's a known issue. I think I posted a few years back about LN only working for a few users without block size increase. 
*"Is there something major missing in this line of reasoning?"*  
People are focusing on the idea of channel factories. It's to make much more efficient use of the exiting block size making 1000's of LN channels at once.
There is also [Statechains]( which is another off-chain and very cool way to move utxo's to new users *and* it is compatible with lightning so you can multiple the benefits of those two together.  
As for the block size itself. The issue with increasing the block size is that you have to weigh that against other network impacts. Here's a chart of max block sizes for satisfying various constraints. Our **current 2.2mb blocksize** already breaks some of these constraints. 
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:06:16
We don't have the data to determine this. We would need to see some bull/bear cycles to know that.

I don't quite get where you are coming from, are you building on what I was saying? Your talking fee's versus block size.  
I think non-ecash use of BTC is fine, I would encourage it even. Bitcoin is the best truth machine we have and we should use it.  
As for demand I expect we can fill fairly large blocks, but blocks should always be artificially constrained at slightly less than the required capacity (if we have otherwise lifted the other critical constraints). That's so we can ensure a healthy fee market.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:55:47
What do you mean segwit2mb? Is that Segwit2x?
The current max block size is 4mb, based on the new blockweight system enabled by segwit. It's 4x the original block size, the non-segwit block size. The 4mb is not possible to access, it averages to about 2.2mb max block sizes. So do you mean increasing the non-segwit blocksize to 2mb, making the new average max 4.4mb?  
  
Re: the centralization idea: Node counts are dropping. In 2010, far far less than 1mb was used. It's basically that &lt;100kb was fine, and in the last couple of years we've jumped to 1mb and we're now growing into about 1.3mb blocks, so the blockchain and UTXO set are growing much faster.  
The response you linked doesn't discuss any of the more critical factors. The claim I made is not bold, it's quite stark. IBD is getting much longer. UTXO sets are growing. The compute cost is growing. 
High end PC's of rich folks isn't the target. Most people use phones, so I think that should be the target. And for reference, looking at stats of PC's from Steam metrics (a gaming platform) it looks like only ~30% of people have enough free space to fit the blockchain on it.
If you don't agree with the constraints on that spreadsheet, what numbers do you think match? The IBD for instance, suggests we should have 270kb blocks, which we are already way over. And we are a little bit over for UTXO usage. 
What is the upper limit of blocksize given UTXO set growth in your opinion? and the same again for IBD?

It's easy enough for consumers to use. IMO **It's the business side that is currently too difficult.**  
 - Most laypersons use Windows, pretty much all documentation is for linux command line.    
 - Accepting lightning payments requires you to run an extra server.  
 - Backups are complicated and risky (you might accidentally replay).  
 - Having to be always online is a risk. 
The introduction of better documentation, eltoo and watch towers will help a lot of this. It would also be great if there was a business that did a custodial lightning merchant service.

You are right we can handle 2mb. Our current max block size **is ~2.2mb**. 
A claim that you are making is that centralization is bad and that we should avoid it. If we up that to 8mb it will cause centralization of the blockchain itself. Which you would be against?   
     
On the other hand, layer 2 solutions allow us to keep the base chain decentralized while building a mixture of decentralized, and centralized services on top. Allowing us to keep BTC as a self sovereign asset.

Nope that's not how the network works. You can't just spin up 1000 nodes to "out vote" 500 nodes. 
It's like having brick layers and hecklers. The brick layers agree on a direction the road is going, and lay bricks in that direction. An infinite number of hecklers doesn't change the direction of the road. If you have brick layers that disagree on the direction of a road, you get a fork and the brick layers continue to lay bricks in their respective directions. Hecklers still having no effect. 
The difference between being a brick layer and heckler is verifying and relaying your own transactions.

If you want small amounts, check for Cashpoints near you, or use Solidi.co.uk or Bittylicious.co.uk, no or limited KYC and you can buy in £5-£100 amounts on a daily basis.  
If you want to buy in larger chunks you'll need to get KYC'ed at which point you might as well go for an exchange.  
Kraken.com and CEX.io are both excellent exchanges that operate in the UK and have good standing. CEX has BTC/£ price pair and is connected to faster-pay, so it is my preferred.

Practically speaking there's no value in that distinction. Your title and conclusion ignores your own distinction too. Most people's assets are custodied, i.e. the money in your bank account, your pension, savings stuff you have in storage etc.  
If the price of bitcoin reaches some high value, then those custodied funds can be sold by their owners. 
And in the next few years more people are going to have bitcoin owned through their pension. That's probably going to represent a significant portion of bitcoin ownership in the near future.

Well in that circumstance the price went up well beyond people's expectations. In this case people are expecting $100k, and on a specific schedule. So it'll probably be lower than expectations.  
  
Have you seen the 4 year cycle stuff? If everyone thinks that cycle will repeat, then it won't. The price will do something completely different. 
My own uneducated guess would be the price topping out at $30-$40k instead of the $50-$100k range, breaking out of the log curve that the price has been following.

A lightning wallet makes connections with other wallets by putting funds in a mutual 2-2 multi-sig wallet. That's called a "payment channel". When you have a payment channel to the rest of the network you can pay people instantly across the lightning network.  
You still have the bitcoin in the wallet, which you can spend at any time, but it's considered to be "locked in" because it is a smart contract with a few extra rules (like the one OP ran afoul of).

Yes you can recover your funds easily from an electrum wallet, provided you wrote down your seed. BIP39 is a standard that most wallet software supports these days.
Yes 12 and 24 word seeds are compatible (in the sense that they are both bip39 supported).
Paper wallets are not good, they are a bad version of the mnemonic seed. Bardcodes are for machines to read, and are easily made un-readable. 12-24 word seeds are really robust and easily recover even if the written words are heavily damaged.
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:40:19
The simplest solution I have seen is a blockplate with the seed on it stored in a safety deposit box.  
  
It's proof against all the threats you outlined, bar 3 &amp; 4, which you solve by testing with a small amount of btc first. Death is handled by the deposit box being open-able with a death certificate. 
Probably the essential thing in this case is **not** encrypting, passphrasing or anything else complicated. Your more likely to make mistakes than an event requiring that extra layer occurring.   
   
Storing $10k+ can be secure this way. 
Heading north of several hundred thousand you want to have the key split into 3 parts with secret sharing and use a pass phrase. In this case you would possibly even pay for security advice and have use of a solicitor for some parts of the security scheme (to enable your family to recover funds).

They lend your bitcoin to businesses that want to borrow bitcoin with $ collatorized loans. I'd guess they charge ~11% to them. This is the reverse of their usual business which is lending $ to Bitcoiners who use their Bitcoin as collateral. This allows people to get cash without triggering tax on selling BTC - and still get the gains on BTC.
  
They have a over 500m of VC funding to fund the fiat loans section of their business. The problem with the Bitcoin loans side of the Business is that no VC can hand them tonnes of BTC, so they have to get bitcoiners to lend them using interest. 
Lending out bitcoin reduces the business risk because it is the opposite bet of their fiat lending business. The downside of them is they are not part of the FCSA scheme, so by putting your money in there you are taking on their business risks.

Lightning uses a thing called a *payment channel* which is a special 2 of 2 multi sig wallet &amp; smart contract; which allows you to keep track of the balance between you and the other wallet owner.  
You don't have to broadcast the state of your wallet to the blockchain in order for you to move the balance between you and your partner.   
The *lightning network* is where many payment channels are linked together, you can pay any one as long as there is a route between you and the recipient.  
A payment route is just where you have a channel to someone who has a channel to someone else...the idea is within 6 hops you'll be able to reach anyone.
A payment goes through the network by updating balances along each channel. 
As you don't need to push the state changes to the blockchain settlement happens instantly. You always have access to your bitcoin and can move them "on-chain" any time you want (closing the payment channel). The draw back of this method is you can only send balances as large as the average sizes of channels along the route. This means the network is better suited for smaller payments (&lt;$200).

Bitcoin is a currency, as people trust it more, they are willing to a) transact with it more b) hold it for longer periods, c) hold it in larger quantities.  
   
Much of the value of the American dollar comes from the fact that people trust it's issuer. Much of it is held oversears by people that use American coinage as a trusted store of value. All governments print money and "devalue" their currencies, but some do it more responsibly than others. Individuals use the currency of the least risk.  
Bitcoin is special in that it's issuance can not be controlled by any individual - nor influenced by any government. It is the most trustworthy currency - in fact trustless. At first everyone is skeptical of this, but we are now 9 years into the life of bitcoin and people now understanding its safety and it's awesomeness.  
Hyperinflation occurs when faith is lost in a currency. We are observing Hyperdeflation where trust rapidly accrues in a currency.

e.g. the State holder receives a small lightning payment as part of the process of signing in an atomic way.    
I know "Pay per sign" can be achieved easily using trust, but it would be very interesting to have a smart contract based system for managing this. Statechains could end up being like an LN routing node where you run it to provide the service and make a little money for doing so without the "users" of statechains having to trust you.

They are wrong on this point. Currencies get their value from having physical properties that make them useful as a currency. This is similar to how some materials are good for building musical instruments. 
One important property is scarcity, gold is useful as a currency because of it's scarcity in addition to being durable, divisible, unreactive etc. That's why it is valuable. Remember price != value.   
Bitcoin get's it's value from the same physical (now digital) properties as gold. Being digital it has a big downside, requiring a computer, but an brilliant upside, you can transmit it anywhere in the world relatively quickly.  
As a token to represent value Bitcoin is really cool and valuable.   
It's price is some function of the number of users, the amount of stored value, speculation, currency velocity, coins-lost-behind-sofa and peoples mood. As more people start using Bitcoin the value increases because you can swap it with more people (similar to telephones are rubbish if your the person with one. Phones are great if some people you know them and amazing if *all* your friends have one).  The price doesn't necessarily increase with the value and vice versa.  
*"Shouldn't we therefore be looking into ways to iterate bitcoin to make sure it is constantly "better" than competing coins?"*
That is exactly what is happening. Bitcoin, has SegWit, Lightning &amp; a satellite network, and thousands of ATM's - which most other coins don't have. That would make it more valuable than another coin with the same network size (which would cause a higher price due to investment /speculation). There is also Scnhorr, MAST &amp; side chains in the works. Bitcoin will be **even better** next year.

The first question has some incorrect assumptions. A bloated network is a sign of good things, like a full restaurant.  A person doesn't have to spend tens of thousands of dollars, they can by $5 worth at any time.   
Yes the return is high now because the risk is high. Later the return will be low and the risk will be low.  
I wasn't claiming that bitcoin would reach "10m because the supply is large enough". I was stating that the pool of monetary value is so large, that a $10m price can be supported and the world will carry on as usual. The post I was responding to was presuming some doom and gloom scenario.

Historically when a currency looses trust, it gets used more rapidly than quality currencies resulting in a flood of the poor quality currency in the market.  
If a nation has a single currency and people no longer trust the currency then long term investments in that currency cease and will seek goods. The price of goods will rise rapidly compared to that currency.   
When quality metal coins were made, they started trading for value above their metal content - we never got to see how this played out because kings / states imediety took control of mints and rapidly debased the quality metal coin.

Virtual currency is a simulated currency. Meaning it does not have the properties of money. An example is virtual currencies in games. The supply is controlled by the game company, they decide when to issue more (or sometimes not as bugs create duplication).  
  
Digital currency has all the properties of money, while existing on the internet.  
  
 
The terminology sounds very similar, but the difference is significant. Blockchain currencies are closer to "real money" like gold than fiat currencies. Fiat is closer to a virtual currency as they are no longer backed by gold and the circulation amount can be changed by the issuer.

1. The routing "problem" you describe is the same as the internet in general, it's somewhat outside of the scope of the lightning protocol itself. As far as I can tell, while it's something that will always need improving, is not a problem for making transactions in the way that you describe.   
**1a/b**. It will (and already is) using a "scale free" network topology that does not involve hub and spoke models.  
**1a/b**. With 20 hops, if each node has 5 connections that gives you a total addressable size of 95 trillion nodes.  
**1b**. Nodes keep a small database of connections. The bigger the database the more possible routes.  
**1c**. If a node goes offline after the route is confirmed the payment fails, otherwise it will just go route around the dead node. Remember that this happens in round trip times, so it a typical payment happens in less than 100ms. Not much time for a node to go down.
2. As previously mentioned, LN is not a hub and spoke network. Multiple   
**2a**. Uh what? Doesn't make any sense. It's worth you reading up on how lightning transactions work. The case described here doesn't happen.  
If onchain transactions are £50 each you can continue to use existing channels and or channel factories - as well as get on the network using another currency. LN is **currency agnostic**. 
1. **(3?)** Uh what again? This doesn't seem to have anything to do with LN transactions.
**All LN tx's are valid bitcoin transactions**. They aren't really "offchain" they are on-chain transactions but they are cashed and never broadcasted.   
The base layer transaction throughput is mediated by price. If there are too many people closing out at £50 per tx then the price will rise until there is less demand. People will also use batching, looping, factories etc to make each tx more efficient too.
I highly recommend going through vidoes describing the thechnical compents of how this network opperates. The stuff you are common falshoods that are spread about LN that don't accurately critique lightning issues.

That's actually quite an important question at this stage. 
  
The first part is easy to answer, you have a wallet app, that has a bitcoin balance that managers it's own LN connections - you don't really know or care about this. On recieving an invoice (scanning a barcode) you see "£3.50 for Lochness fishing simulator" and press pay. Sweet and simple.
The other part is harder. Does Valve have a native (to steam) LN payment system? How will valve get their $? Will we have to go through a 3rd party payment system like Bitpay again? 
Ideally (for me) they would implement it in the steam client, so it doesn't need to be outsourced to another website (like paypal / bitpay) and simply show you a barcode to scan.

Each square charges a different fee, but since you can choose the route, you'll just go through squares with the lowest fee.   
The fee would be the sum of all the squares you pass through.

It's better to have a flexible money supply that expands and contracts with population / production - the difficulty is **trusting** an entity to control that supply responsibly. Trust is the strength of a crypto currency. Flexible issuance is the weakness.  
I think we will end up with complimentary currencies to Bitcoin to act as the flexible supply, or perhaps something ambitious like Dai might work too.

Bitcoin does not need to be backed by anything else it's what you back other currencies with.
Gold is (was) useful as a currency because of it's material properties, that made it fungible, divisble, scare etc. The way mining worked acted like a good monetary policy.
  
Fiat works as well or better than gold if you have a responsible central bank. The "fiat" that it works on trust trust-in-a-third-party instead of properties of a limited commodity.
  
Bitcoin has the same properties of gold, with the big upside of being transmitable and programmable. The downside is it requires internet + computers.
As it is a limited commodity it works as a currency without the trust in a third party.

If we simplified the network to 2 nodes, the mining node, and the merchant node.  
  
If the miner changes the rules, and the merchant node disagrees, we end up with 2 forks, *minerFork* and *merchantFork*, when the miner wants to sell their *minerFork* coins, they can't because the merchant does not process the miners transactions.  
**Both** the miner node &amp; the merchant node have to agree to a rule change together.   
Realistically there are several groups: *miners, merchants, exchanges, users, developers*. And they must all or mostly agree in order to change rules. Non mining user, merchant and exchange nodes have the power to change protocol.

A payment channel is basically a multi-sig wallet that you and the other party control. You pass bitcoin backwards and forwards along that channel.
A in a cross chain swap you would have a multi-sig wallet for both BTC and LTC. 
You can already do a cross chain swap by trusting another person to send you the 10ltc for the .1 btc that you sent them, but with the payment channel (the two wallets that you both control) you can run code - that is, make a transaction that ensures you get the 10 LTC for the 0.1 BTC.

Yeah it is quite a bit to take in in one go. &amp; jaunjux did point out there is the simpler way of doing cross atomic swaps with a smart contract instead of payment channels.
  
A can sign a contract (a kind of transaction) with B. A's "contract" keeps a secret that gets released to B, once B pays the 10 LTC, A's wallet releases the secret that lets B redeem the BTC. 
You can see an example of the process happening over twitter here:

I gather you are talking about price volatility? 
  
Well it will be like that for a while. Adoption is currently at 1-3% and as new people start using BTC the price of each coin increases.    
This is expected behavior for a growing population. Here's an explanation   
You have to consider, that this is sort of like the internet in the early nineties. Connections were unstable and emails took 2 days. The network is still growing and being made better. 
One thing I do have to mention, most of the volatility is positive...meaning you stand to profit considerably from holding BTC in this bootstrap phase.
  
  
**After Bootstrapping**
Fundamentally Bitcoin will always be a volatile asset, similar to gold, because it's supply is limited (but no where near as volatile as now). One of the reasons we moved to fiat currencies was because it meant the money supply could be expanded with new users and increased activity. 
There are stable coins in development that tackle the problem of rapid growth, and maintaining a stable supply against the cost of goods. An example is MakerDai. If you don't want the volatility you can use that.

This might help. Bitcoin has reached 1-3% adoption. When it reaches 60%, you will have missed out. 
Your bank account will get sorted soon, and even if the price is $20,000, you know you are still getting in to the tech early.  
  
Ofc if you only care about short-term gains and you wouldn't buy at $20k, then probably don't buy it at all. It can still go to $1000 tomorrow.

You create a real market price which allows people to buy cards when they need them. The alternative is that the it becomes a mad rush like black Friday. Then instead of bidding on price you are bidding on who can queue up outside of the shop for the longest. 
You trade one type of un-fairness for another type of unfairness. Just the price based one is more efficient.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:03:33
It can be either.
Take chain A &amp; B, they can be compatible. txA works on chain B and txB works on chain A. 
You can have single direction replay-protection:    
   txA works on B,  txB not work on A  
   txB works on A,  txA not work on B  
  
Bi-directional: txA only works on A and txB only works on B.
   
At the moment there's effectively no replay protection.  
  
You can make optional special transaction:  
txAnoB, which does not work on chain B.  
but standard txA's will still work on chain B. (and all txB's work on A).

Person A has 10 LTC, B has 0.1 BTC.
They make a payment channels:
A&lt;---&gt;B in LTC  
A&lt;---&gt;B in BTC   
A gives 10 LTC to B on the LTC payment channel and B gives 0.1 BTC to A on the BTC channel. The trade is facilitated by code.
The 0.1 BTC, now owned by A, stays in the payment channel, allowing A to spend it later. 
Remember that B probably has a payment channel open with C, C with D etc etc. This means that A can pay that 0.1 BTC to Z or any anyone else in the chain.

No exchanges are not strictly necessary. You could spend LTC in a shop that accepts BTC. It's quite likely that the cross-chain-swap idea will get standardized and then you'll be able to use most crpyto's interchangeably.

New users as in inexperienced. Experienced users would avoid spending until they can find some way to split their coins. 
If the fork happens you'll have BTC and an equal amount of BTCx2. If you send 1 BTCx2 to an address, you'll end up sending 1 BTC **and** BTCx2 to that address. This is because the transaction will be valid on both chains.
Splitting coins involves coming up with a way to spend the coins on one chain and not the other, from then on the sending BTC or BTCx2 would be an invalid spend on the opposite chain.  
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:44:33
Addresses don't have "Balances" they have "Unspent Transaction Outputs" shortened to **UTXO**. When someone sends you 1.384 bitcoin that creates a new UTXO that can only spent by the private key belonging to your address.  
In order to spend 1 BTC from that 1.384 BTC you have to consume that UTXO to make a new UTXO under someone elses address. 
In simple terms you can consider a UTXO to be a "coin" in the sense that you have to move the whole thing. 
When you want to give someone 1 BTC the 0.384 (less the fee) has to be spent to a new UTXO under your control  
What this looks like:
UTXO: 1.384 is used as an input in the following transaction:
**Inputs:** SpendingAddress[1.384], **Outputs:** RecipientAddress[1.00], ChangeAddress[0.383], Remainder[0.001] 
The Recipient Address ends up with a new UTXO of 1.00 btc.
The Change Address ends up with a new UTXO, of 0.383.
The remainder goes to the miners as a fee.(You don't actually see the remainder in the transaction format, you calculate it from the difference of the inputs and outputs).  
If you look at a transaction on the block explorer, you will see "Inputs" from an address on one side, and outputs on the other. The most typical transaction is a "one in two out" transaction where someone spends part of the balance of an address. Typically you send money back to a new address you control instead of the same address because of privacy and security concerns.

BC is not a business it's a currency - so it doesn't generate revenue.  It's value comes from its various uses. It's a great store of value, and it's great at transfering value. A unique propery is it does those first two features without counter party risk. It has many other features which it you can read about. 
Remember the **price** of a bitcoin is not it's **value**.  
If we had some way to magically generate a 10 tokens each time there was a new user, each token would have a lower price than they currently do. Currently new tokens are issued at a rate slower than new users need tokens for to carry out their transactions. So the ammount of value each token has to represent increases.  A naive way to think about a currency is TotalRepresentedValue / NumberOftokens = PriceOfToken. Currently the network represents ~$90bn dollars.   
  
The more people have a currency the more useful it is. The token price thing is very strange, it's worth ignoring the price and just thinking about how useful bitcoin is as a technology. I myself equate Bitcoin to TCP/IP - a protocal we use for the internet. In otherwords I think it's very revolutionary. Bitcoin and it's features aren't the best bit, it's the software and other things that can be built on top of it that literally change the world.

**David Murray, recommended that Congress create a new class of regulated financial institutions known as “virtual asset transaction validators,” i.e. crypto miners.**. 
Transactions are validated by the network, that's the mempool. Miners choose what to include in the blocks. 
**...miners must, at the very least, govern who can participate in networks, and vet any issuers, exchanges or custodians they serve.**
It's open source, and miners have no say in who can and can not participate in the network. Perhaps American miners could exclude transactions from their blocks. Everyone else will include them though.

Bubble - A situation where the price is higher than the intrinsic value of the asset.
Bitcoin is a currency and it's utility (thus it's value) goes up as there are more users &amp; new features are added. 
Bitcoin is constantly being improved, and being tested for resilience. It is also getting lots of new users. Each of these factors will cause the price to rise.  
The price of a single bitcoin is going up as expected based on user adoption.

Receiving bitcoin is a probabilistic event. You could view this chart as an "How likely is it I own this coin?" chart for a newly received transaction when it has been confirmed in a single block.  
When your node receives a block, that may not be the block that is included in the final chain since multiple can be found at the same time. The chart shows the odds of a block being ditched.

The usability issues are trivial and would be fixed very quickly if the other problems were not there. 
    
I'm thinking of general retail, so that includes Steam games, corner shops, bars in clubs, ticket machines, supermarkets etc. 
I don't think Ethereum's 15s block time is fast enough for those cases either. (Variance means some times there is a 1m+ wait before confirmation, which is a no-go for retail).

The new fork will not have replay protection - this means that transactions will be valid on both chains. A "replay attack" is where sending a coin on one sends that same coin on the other chain. 
New users will get their coins stolen, most exchanges will close - to avoid theft / accidental lose of money. In contrast the BCH fork had replay protection and split off fairly cleanly.

From your posts it looks like you fundamentally don't understand price versus  value. The price is not the relevent factor. And again units are completely arbitrary. 
A bitcoin token can be spent at more locations, if you  are a merchant there are  users who can purchase your goods with bitcoin. Bitcoin being a larger network has been tested more than other tokens.
The intrinsic value of gold is not it's price. Your statement is the same as saying 1kg of silver is cheaper than 1kg of gold. The price for an arbitrary unit is not relevant. In the case of gold Vs silver I could buy £100 of either. Gold is easier to resell because there is a bigger market for it.
I feel you are talking from the perspective of a speculative investor and are asking form people to convince you BTC is the best cow to bet on. 
If you read about what bitcoin is and does and why it is important you'll see that    alt  coins are different in their value proposition. They each solve different problems with different levels of security.

I don't have any good links on the topic. The problem was mentioned in talks / articles from many years ago. The best thing I found is this:
*"If your bitcoin is sent to an address that has ONLY received and NEVER sent any bitcoin, then they are secured by all three of the algorithms listed above.  Weaknesses in all three would have to be discovered before someone could take your bitcoin.  If you have any bitcoin that is sent to an address that has EVER been used to send bitcoin, then those are only secured with ECDSA (meaning a weakness discovered in ECDSA would leave your bitcoin vulnerable).  The likelihood of a weakness being discoved in all three algorithms within a short time of each other is pretty slim.  This is one reason that it is generally recommended that you use a new address for every transaction and never re-use bitcoin addresses."*
  
from   
  
So this does mean your coins are safe even if ECDSA is broken. (And you don't re-use the addresses)

For my own view on the project: I think it's going well. It's enabling me to create ways for people to share products that could not be done before. 
I think in the future LN payments will be simpler than the raw transactions we use today. 
I'm worried that routing will only work 99% of the time, which by comparison makes it a shitty user experience compared to contactless (instant tap-n-pay debit card) payments.  
There is a chance for BTC to become money if LN works well, but it might not cut it.

You pay CGT (Capital Gains Tax) when you make a profit on selling (or trading for another asset, including other crypto's).   
You can just keep a spreadsheet or a written note of the price you paid for your bitcoin.   
If you bought 10 BTC for $10 each totalling $100 dollars. If you sold them for  $100 dollars each, you would have a profit of $900 dollars. I don't know the CGT tax rate in the US. But for example it might be 20%, so you would owe $180.

I think there are 6 repeated points from the lovers, the haters and the indifferent. Interestingly some of the criticisms of the haters is shared with the LN developers.
1) The lightning network is a potential significant scaling of the base blockchain for time sensitive transactions.
2) The lightning network will provide a much lower fee alternative to raw bitcoin transactions.
3) The lightning network is too complicated for the average individual to use at this point in time
4) The lightning network has it's own scaling problems: routing, liquidity, dependency on base blockchain fees.
5) It's an unfinished product, not commercially ready. With a chance of losing funds. Use at own risk. 
6) It's a centralized network. (While not true, this view is generally held).

It probably was fraud (but not caused by you). The owner of the account probably had their account compromised and £200 was spent with it. The real fraudster got your bitcoin, the other victim got their £200 back. Because the money doesn't move an additional step you are considered to be the recipient of the real fraud.  
Consider, in another case the money would usually end up in a business like Amazon. In this case they would assume the fraudster has goods instead of the money. Also Amazon would just eat the loss.

Yes of course, no one actually sits there and does the maths by hand on a piece of paper. When you sign a message (which could contain a transaction or an email) the software on your computer does it for you.

The value of money is a hard concept to understand, and since we use money every day it's a thing we think we understand but we don't. 
Mostly people conflate "price" and "value", like they did in that video.  
I find the easiest way to separate the two concepts, in a way that people are familiar with is gift vouchers. A $10 gift voucher has a price of $10, but if it's for a candle shop, not everyone will value it at $10. A $10 Walmart voucher might have more value than a candle shop voucher, but still less than a $10 bill.  
A $10 bill is not worth $10, it represents $10 of value. Conversation goes easier once you identify that notes are representative tokens.

A lot of alts are primarily priced in bitcoin so go up and down with bitcoin. And many only have value in relation to bitcoin.

It's not a straight forward thing and not every case is the same. In some cases price is a better mediator, in other cases time is better. If you have a fixed price you end up with dickish behaviour too, nepotism, cheating, stealing etc. 
  
For instance, in my local community we have a ticketed event, the tickets sell quickly, sometimes instantly, but we prefer time to be the mediator because we want the event to be accessible for people on low incomes. In your ticket reseller case organizers should put work in to stop the reselling behaviour.     
 
High end GPU's on the other hand are better mediated by price, because some people may really need the resource for something, (as in would pay thousands) but can't compete with a teenager queueing at a shop for hours. It also sends pricing signals to the manufacturer (and competitors) to say additional capacity is needed. Also people with spare GPU's will sell them second hand. Some might even be saved from going to the dump. Price is better in this case, otherwise you end up with Nepotism being the winning factor.  
  
What really sucks now is that, Nvidia know they have excess demand, but they are not going to produce more GPU's because it poses an existential business risk for them. (they are worried alt coin market might die out next year). So we are a little stuck with this situation.

*" Wouldn't it make sense to hodl bitcoin on a nonsegwit address still, so long as its secure?"*  
Yes, if you have no reason to move your coins there's no reason to change address format for now. You can wait until the need to move arises. If you have lots of UTXO's though, it might be worth collecting them - UTXO takes up memory.  
*" Is the miner selection algorithm particular about not mining arbitrarily large blocks"*  
Not really, they can do it how they like. However, you can't *"artificially bloat blocks"* Block space is paid for in sat/byte. The number of transactions is somewhat irrelevant. There is about 2.2mb of block space up for auction and you can buy it all if you want. 
*"is lightning an issue promoting segwit addresses since they have this potential attack vector for dummy block space, given affordable fees?"*  
Lightning is a second-layer payment network, it has nothing to do with SegWit. And "dummy" block space isn't a thing. 
*"but i'm concerned this might set a precedent to have the next "soft" fork with a new technology or layer increase the block max to 8 or 16mb."**  
Blocksize can be increase by a hard or soft fork, delivery method doesn't matter. You are right about chain growth, which is why there was a split in ideas about how to increase throughput. I think the current idea is to Optimize the hell out of the space we do have, before we make it bigger. Every byte comitted to the chain is permanant. 
*"The softfork segwit was adopted, in part so that the lightning network could be built"* 
Lightning could implemented without SegWit. But SegWit improves scriptability for lightning and any other use case. 
SegWit was to address several issues:  
1) UTXO set growth (1in2 out used to be cheaper than 2in1 out)  
2) Transaction malleability bug fix.  
3) Script versioning  
4) Block size increase

Most alts are priced in BTC, so they come along for the ride with BTC.   
It takes time for their price to update versus fiat if there is no direct fiat trading pair. Also there are fewer applications that take advantage of those networks, so their price doesn't track it's utility.   
As a contrast, Ethereum has lots of applications that use it's network, so it's price is tracking it's own utility - which you can partly see in it's current huge network fees. (High fees are bad, but it tells you people are willing to pay for the utility the network has to offer).

There are about 450 forked projects that have come from Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is one these many, but probably the first to directly keep the same UTXO set.  It was a successful project fork, it has it's own ecosystem and developers who are working on philosophically different features. 
  
For hard forks, as in one's that upgrade protocol: A failed hardfork could be one that **a)** fails to activate **b)** forks the network into two (or 6 in Monero's case?) **c)** causes the network to stop operating.
In cases **a)** and **b)** you can carry on as usual. In case **c)** I guess you would have to roll back to blocks before the hardfork was started. If all goes as planned everyone upgrades before the fork date, then swaps to the new protocol on the fork date, and nothing exciting happens.

The speed of light is the constraint on block times. It takes about 40 seconds for a block to fully propagate around the globe. The 10 minute wait time is roughly the shortest time between block to achieve consensus securely. At the bottom layer Bitcoin is a time stamping tool. 
Other alt coins have shorter time but at a the cost of security and mining centralisation. Litrcoin has 2  min blocks, but to ensure the same level of security for a payment as bitcoin you  to wait the same amount of time, not blocks. 6 confs in bitcoin is considered secure. Which takes about 1h. In LTC you should watch for 30 blocks.

It's impossible. Here's a video that explains what 2^256 means in terms of how easy it is to find someone's private key:
If you make an arbitrary address, no one will have the private key to it. 
Then there is the idea of vanity addresses. These are addresses that are instead of appearing random, have a name or some word at the start. They are really difficult to "find" 
It takes exponentially more computing power to add an extra letter to your vanity address. It's very similar to mining. Each extra letter increases the difficulty. In the Counterparty address above, the row X's has put the difficulty into the realm of impossibility, so we can be confident they don't own the key.

Do you mean the initial generation or do you mean you do not want a HD (hierarchically deterministic) wallet?   
Old wallets had bad methods of generating addresses, which meant you could "lose" coins by not generating the associated address in a new wallet. HD wallets use a master key as a seed to generate private keys.
If you don't want to use that then you'd need to generate your own PK's on the fly and import them into Electrum / Core wallets.
If you just mean for the generation, you can create your own wallet from dice rolls and convert that into a BIP39 HD wallet. The seed-words thing is the same as using numbers, but it's human readable.

This is actually a situation where the limited supply makes BTC less useful. Usually you would issue new money to match the new supply that you need. Since you can't do that in Bitcoin, it would be hard for any country to "swap" to BTC in an elegant way. A natural switch would leave bag holders - which would typically be the most vulnerable members of society.  
I think it could be done if someone issued a BTC backed currency. E.g. If we had a "New Duetchmark" that was issued and was redeemable for BTC, you could swap from Euro's to ND's at a fixed exchange rate.
I think something like Dai will be more likely to be the world currency than BTC. Being able to expand and contract the money supply is important for having a high quality currency.

*Item2, $100,*  
  
*Total to pay $150,  or BTC0.0056 (2% discount)*  
  
*&lt;BankDetails&gt;*  
*&lt;BitcoinAddress&gt;*  
  
  
This way you have done all the work for the other person already. All they have to do is get the crypto and pay to the address. Working out crypto to fiat is a pain, a person wouldn't know what exchange rate to use etc.

There's  only about 14m coins in circulation - or what we consider to probably be accessible. if Satoshi touches the coins we would know there are an additional billion coins that could be sold.  
Oh and then they'd probably get kidnapped and tortured because there would be serious political power in having 1m BTC.

I did do it myself. I used other sources to double check.  I didn't use the same method as Digiconimist, so it's a big coincidence that I got a similar figure.  I came up with **13 TWH** a year excluding profit / machinery. 
Also I'm describing the relationship between our usage of of Bitcoin and energy consumption, if my numbers are off, the relationship is still the same. 
4.7 or 13 TWH for current usage, in the future that is going to go up by some orders of magnitude. 
Actually I think you might have misread my post. The numbers I used in my post were about future bitcoin prices, not current.

No this chart is wrong. Every two weeks the Hashing power **increases by ~5%**, so your share of the reward declines by 5%. So the profit per year is going to be closer to $1400 than $3800 dollars.  
The next difficulty period is going to change by **more than 10%**.

The process preserves value (or creates), if you didn't do the burn, you would be arbitrarily handing out a new currency, which is very difficult to do fairly if you want to do it anonymously.   
  
It's also worth talking about the concept of a "shitcoin". After BTC came out and everyone "missed" the opportunity to get rich (when BTC was $100 each) people made new coins, some with geniune intentions to make something valuable to society, many were just so the developers and early-comers could mine the first batch of coins and get rich. Some developers even had "Pre-mined" coins where they started with balanced of millions of coins. Many of them were effective scams. 
  
Bitcoin has had fairish distribution because early miners didn't know it was going to be worth anything, and early-ish adopters were actually taking a risk on the unknown. As a result a couple million of the earliest coins are actually lost.

I can see that for some users the relative additional cost for node operation would be negligible so they would do so, but SPV would still easier and costs less if fees were higher. I still can't see how Tx's being higher than the cost of a node changes the incentive to run an SPV node in a general case. Is there some factor I am missing? Or do you mean it in a broad sense of incentives rather than a "rule" per se?
 
Personally I'm incentivised to use SPV because it increases my security due to limitations of using hardware wallets - despite having multiple (possible) full-nodes.

Bitcoin will increase in comparison to it's market cap and as you are well aware that's growing exponentially while taking the UK as an example energy is increasing at a very low (and hopefully soon negative) rate. 
I know bitcoins energy consumption is negligible now, but in a few short years it will be using enormous amounts of energy.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:50:58
I was not suggesting that, edited the post for clarity.  
  
I agree with you in that the sum of the businesses it's replacing use a lot of energy, a code based system would be more efficient.
The problem I am seeing is the amount of energy we put into the system has no economic relationship to the businesses it's replacing, the security require and so on. It's based on a percentage of the "market cap" of bitcoin. That percentage cost, could easily eclipse the value we saved.
and you are right, the halvings will be very important.  
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:21:13
6btc block fees is ~1,100 sats/byte fee or ~$30 per tx (if bitcoin is the same price).  I expect bitcoin will be around $50k before the end of the next halving so that puts fees in the region of $150. 
Can someone else also run the numbers just to check?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:32:12
ViaBTC are creating a new currency called "Bitcoin Cash" it is different to Bitcoin, but unlike other altcoins, it will have a shared history with Bitcoin. So if you own 0.1 Bitcoin when they new currency is created you will own 0.1 Bitcoin cash in addition to your Bitcoin.  
That only works if you hold the private key yourself. Most exchanges are ignoring the new currency and won't credit your account with Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:02:22
Oh I know it'll have wiped out lots of industries, but that just only just about justifies it's **current** energy consumption, which is already country sized. 
I know people only look at the energy cost in terms of transactions "it's 1700x more energy than Visa" they say, but Bitcoin does more:
* Custodial services
* International transactions / remittance
* Secure high value transactions
* Trustware (entirely new thing)
* Remove counterparty risk
* Business contracts 
If it can stick to 13 TWH it'll be great. However if Bitcoin grows to use  **more** energy than the businesses it's replacing then that is a problem indeed.
Edit: clarity.

That's an oversimplification and inaccurate. This is my suggestion to deal with **short term demand spikes** and to reduce fees for users.

Depends on how much you want to buy. £10, go to the nearest cash point. Bittylicious &amp; Solidi are both great for £10-£200, both allowing you to pay using your regular bank account.   
If you want to buy larger amounts I would say CEX.IO, you can wire them £ in the UK and they have a £/BTC trading pair, so you skip the pain of currency conversion in banks. Their £ deposit withdrawal and deposit system is a little clunky, but deposits from UK accounts are free.

I don't think it's controversial. SegWit is a blocksize increase. People just need to be educated on how to utilize it so we can all benefit from the extra capacity.  
Looking slightly longer term, we'll need to increase the block size again, but I don't think a naive 1 off increase is worth doing. It needs to be some kind of scaling size, with a limiting factor so it can't grow too quickly.

You'll have to explain in more detail. I don't know where you are coming up with 40%. 
It's a data limit rather than "transaction" (not all are the same size) and afaik Segwit allows for data to be kept in the witness section at a ratio of 4:1. A block consisting of entirely witness data would be 4mb in size (but no really possible). And the maximum average is 2.2mb which is some realistic combination of normal block data to witness data. That's a +120% increase in tx's (data). 
Here's someone's answer to tx count added by SegWit breaking down the tx format giving +134% capacity given 100% segwit tx's:

has a tax thread that covers this as does (MakerDOA is actually the first decentralized loans)  
The point of concern is a "disposing of assets" if you dispose of an asset (a chair, a £, a $, bitcoin) that causes a taxable event. For people who have made lots of gains in BTC, but want access to $ without disposing of your assets you can use a collaterlized loan. 
If you put your BTC down as collateral for a loan in DAI or $, you gain access to $ without disposing of an asset. (You still own the BTC). Getting money from a loan doesn't count as income.  
As a side note:  
At the moment everyone is treating Decentralized loans as a loan, although for every legal definition I could find, there needs to be an "agent" that is the lender (i.e. a person or a corporation). So it's possible, in the strictest of terms, a decentrlized "loan" is not a loan. I haven't seen anyone else comment on this so I don't know if it's right.

The trick is education. People need to learn that they can _wait a few blocks_, _batch transactions together and send them at the end of the week_, _use segwit_ &amp; patience.

The CMC "dominance" ranking is a stupid metric. It's "largest aggregate asset value".   
1) Lots of crypto's don't actually have the supply that is counted (ripple etc)  
2) Asset values like this are meaningless because you can't sell or buy the whole pile at the given price.   
3) It doesn't include any kind usage metrics or infrastructure. Bitcoin has more cashpoints, a satalite network more exchanges etc than litecoin. If litecoin had the same aggregate value it would still be far less dominant because it   has so little infrastructure and usage in comparison.

The liquidity depth is not that large, it wouldn't be any different to what is already happening. Large amounts of purchases occur - outstripping the mining supply and the price goes up sharply. The next day some hodler sees their wallet has $1m of BTC in it and they cash out to an exchanging adding to liquidity and dropping the price. Traders spread the supply of BTC out from the faucets to where the demand is.  Contrary to popular belief Bitcoin doesn't have a market cap, it is a commodity (in this case) Purchasing half will make the remaining supply price increase.
TLDR: It would take months for any actor to buy a significant quantities of coins, during that time the price would rise significantly.

One simple fact is that alts are priced in Bitcoin. Very few have a price in fiat currencies. It requires active work from traders to bring the  price down after bitcoin hikes.  
A further factor is that after people make "sweet gainz" in bitcoin they spread their money into other assets. 
Outside investment interest picks up too, which funds new and existing alt coin projects, and some of that goes into marketing to get people to buy into the altcoins.
