I am the developer. Thanks for the update! This security feature is now in place. I gladly welcome feedback or security features anyone would like to suggest. PM me anytime!

johnnybluejeans you have invested far too much time in this. Start up a consulting business instead of giving this much information away for free.

Perhaps you can refresh my memory about which case - through PM? He mentioned a couple things but I'm not sure which you're referring to. I know you had a couple ideas that people might want to hear.
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:21:28
Yes this is correct. Coins are held in a "escrow" account.

I went to this a couple weeks ago and it was a huge disappointment. I expected at least 50% of the 20 ish vendors to take bitcoin. I found 2. One for lemonade and another for belts. Most of the vendors I asked seemed to be confused by the question "do you take bitcoin?".

Thank you, here are a few things I have implemented:
- Coordinate Obfuscation when planting coins.
- A limit on dig attempts before paying a fee.
- SSL to limit packet sniffing
- Option to add password when storing coins.
- Methods to prevent jumping from area to area by spoofing your coordinates. Of course this falls apart when teleportation devices are invented.
Additionally, I am open to any ideas would like to provide. :)
Of course only so much can be done to prevent "spoofing". So you should always plant with a password and never plant more than you can afford to lose. The app does not have the ability to take more than $35 per day from your account.

This is awesome news!

use brainwallet instead

This same exact thing happened to me a couple months ago. After a period of 30 days coinbase will automatically refund unclaimed bitcoin. But I would try to create a coinbase account with the email address first (if possible), to get the bitcoin back right now.

It's people like you that keep me developing! :)

First of all thank you for trying the app and the feedback. An inside app map is something I was going to add but didn't have enough time to fit in before the contest deadline. I believe this to be a good idea and will attempt to implement it in the near future.
To answer your questions, there is no password hint. Is it possible you're referring to the message input? As for nothing showing up if you're password is incorrect this is normal functionality.

unfortunately.. not that skilled :(

I like the app, I like the idea. I've been to the site a number of times and every time until now i got the feeling that this was a charity site. Which is great, but it's not what you guys do. Perhaps a better background image? From one developer to another though, your work is amazing.
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:08:34
I have no plans for this.
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:38:35
I will do my best to add a "hide" option in the next update. So your coins can stay hidden from prying eyes. Thanks for this suggestion - I think its a good one and needed.

@_date: 2013-11-04 23:36:05
unfortunately no.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:23:48
still waiting on a response from you.. :(
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:49
It's just you.  is up. Not to say it wasn't down, just might not have been that long.

Do you have an obscure or stange house number? The credit card processing software that I am familiar with checks only for the correct home number when verifying address. Street name is overlooked. It's possible you could try entering your address with just the number? Please report back to us with your results! :)

come on man! don't argue over whether something is a bubble or not from a guy named bbbbbubble!!!! =p

Liquidity is the main reason a gap exists between exchanges. Some exchanges are easier for fund transfers while others impose restrictions/regulations which make exchanging a bit more tricky.

I'm with coinbase on this. Their practice of auto refunding money is a good idea - but the address should only be seen to the potential buyer of something. It should not be displayed in my account as an address to receive bitcoins. Regardless, i have PM'd you my email.

@_date: 2013-11-04 00:20:09
thank you for this!

Nothing seems wrong with it? The currency is priced in Chinese Yuan not US dollars, if you're wondering why its so much higher.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:08:22
Why is not recommended to purchase bitcoins with paypal? Surely there is no risk for the buyer?
If someone is willing to give you bitcoins for paypal money I say take it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:04:40
How much bitcoin did you lose? Coinbase refunded me today, see UPDATE at the top.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:38:08
whats wrong with open source frameworks? :(
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:28:58
This is an awesome app. Thanks for the work you put into it! Do you have your own database of sites that accept bitcoin from this app? If so, I hope that you will start your own website with it.
