I like that has finally decided to embrace cryptocurrencies as a whole. :) We are all in this together, with the ultimate goal of making the most useful and secure money possible.

If miners collude, they can do a lot more damage than increasing the transaction fees. If they can collude enough to do this, they could almost as easily execute a 51% attack. Collusion of miners has always been a Bitcoin weakness, but it doesn't happen because there's hopefully too many different independent parties.

A country's government wouldn't actually buy the Butterfly cards, they could contract out the manufacture of their own.
And I am responding to some answers because I don't think they sufficiently address the problem. And because I wanted to start a discussion. Why else would I challenge peoples' answers?

That's why I recently sold my DOGE into BTC.
I have an open buy order when DOGE reaches 0.00000160 BTC again. Note: Do not do this sort of thing with money you're not willing to lose.

Could a government ever see Bitcoin as a threat? A lot of answers by people in this sub would be "yes". If that's the case, could a government do a 51% attack? Again the answer seems to be yes. If a state saw Bitcoin as a threat they would not be interested in earning Bitcoins, they'd be more concerned with keeping the relevancy of their own currency.
Now, how effective would an attack like this be? How easy would a workaround be? I don't think it would permanently kill Bitcoin, but it would probably require a new mining algorithm, which means basically starting over on a new blockchain. And then you've killed Bitcoin 1.0.
As for justifying a $1B expense to taxpayers... we spend more than that on projects every single day that the taxpayers never even hear about. $1B would be 0.03% of annual expenses for the US government. But that's just the United States. Any sufficiently wealthy actor, private or public, could cause this attack if they had enough funds and the intention.

The Afghan government being corrupt and doing secretive things with our money is hardly the same as us intentionally giving Al Qaeda money.

Yes it has, and when that happens, the USA goes after the medium of funding and tries to cut it off, whether it be Western Union, bank transfers, or sales of goods/services. They also use the same reasoning to try to stop the drug trade. They don't really succeed, but they sure spend a lot of money doing it. My point is the USA can and does try to stop people from giving terrorists money, and they spend a considerable amount doing it. Your argument doesn't hold up because the government often *does* attack or regulate the medium of exchange in order to stop terrorist funding.

You mean require an immediate upgrade (possibly several) and fork the blockchain (possibly several times)? I don't think this will work. The threat that would be caused by this kind of 51% attack seems more severe than this to me.

It's not hard to imagine these headlines. Especially if some of the more fanatic Bitcoiners are right and BTC will start to threaten the dollar. $1B is nothing to most governments. Less than a drop in the bucket.

This seems like a hand-waving dismissal to me. Chip fabrication isn't hard for a nation-level entity to get done, and covertly at that. This level of chip fabrication is already done every day for a myriad of applications. Also yes, I think the NSA could absolutely have enough competence to pull this off. They already have massive warehouse-sized datacenters that monitor all internet and phone traffic. And they did that in secret. That certainly cost more than $1B to pull off.

Why couldn't the attacker simply start mining again on the "legit" blockchain? Create near-constant forks. You'd have to change the algorithm, like you said. Make a Bitcoin v2.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:18:27
No, that's for regimes that we want to keep in power, or ones who will kowtow to our interests. The US might give secret money to, say, a corrupt dictator who will give us favorable trade deals, but the CIA sure as hell do not give suitcases full of cash to Al Qaeda. That doesn't even make sense on a conspiracy theory level.

Why do present prices have to be updated every 10 minutes? The only thing the prices would be used for would be to change the difficulty, which in Bitcoin changes once every two weeks.
Perhaps something that would work is to tag goods sold by merchants? That would be a way to see how prices change over time. If something gets sold 10 times a day, it would be fairly easy to see how the price fluctuates.
This is just an idea anyway. If it can't work, it can't work.

That's a good question. I suppose for some set period, mining would be Bitcoin-style, and then transition over when the coin reaches a predetermined price (higher than target).
As for the price index, the real challenge is the measurement. An identical index simply has to be used in the majority of coin users, the same way transactions are all agreed upon currently in Bitcoin.

What you said is true. However I believe if you have a large enough number of actors, patterns will emerge. We cannot predict what the market will do, but I do think we can objectively value commodities. Almost every commodity has a market rate. Gold, silver, Bitcoin, consumer electronics, everything. How else would their prices get set? Of course people are willing to pay more or less for something based on their own whims, needs, and desires, but for a given demand, the price tends to reach a mean for a given supply. This mean is often not reached instantly or perfectly, but I think it is reached. It doesn't matter how each actor individually ranks a product... it only matters what the actors do on average over a set amount of time. It would be my hope that speculation or change in valuing of any one item over time could be offset by measuring price changes in a large "basket" of goods bought.

Herp derp this *isn't* a bubble **in meme form** isn't wisdom either.

You don't think things have a real value? Certainly I can say a car is worth more than a pen. Of course then you get into marginal utility and all that (a pen will be worth more to someone, somewhere), but on average, a car is more valuable than a pen.

If it's never been sold before, or you're selling it used, you'd price it however you thought was fair, or to whatever you thought someone would pay. Just like now.


I don't see how this would change the value of the money.


That doesn't involve currency.


Illegal goods have a market value just like everything else.
I was more concerned with curbing speculation than deflation. I know some deflation wouldn't kill a currency, but imho it's not ideal. Minimizing deflation is just a side effect of curbing speculation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:00:21
That is an interesting point. Though I would argue that Bitcoin is currently centralized in a similar way already by the agreed-upon blockchain. Similarly, the price index would have to be agreed upon by the majority. The only real difference I can see is that the mining difficulty is set in a different way.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:09:36
I agree with this criticism. Measuring the true value of the coin in some way would be the biggest design challenge.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:12:55
I agree. It doesn't have to be based upon a price index, it just has to be some accurate way to measure real value.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:04:24
Once everyone agreed upon the measurement system, that is what would be used. I see no reason why this couldn't be decentralized in the software. It would not need to change after that point. Also the US government is not the only entity that makes price indicies:
