Lol. You are extremely correct
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:39:08
sounds very inspiring. The world is in our hands
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:17:12
I can do that. Nice that we could reach our goals and make them fear with a such small community

I think it's not about words context but about the effectiveness of its' coming into a private life of a concrete person. If someone understand all the pluses personally for him, he'll step on a "dark side".
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:12:24
What the tipping point is? 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:02:23
Decentralization of the courtroom can change a lot
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:40:31
Or other... or bouth

We should call Winklevoss twins, because we are in a PUMP ZONE!111

@_date: 2014-05-11 12:37:38
5 people with money supplied by a wealthy financial institution could have a chance of succeeding.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:10:58
Buying a huge numbers of bitcoin nowadays can make their price higher, but, you know... without a serious changes price will fall again
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:44:35

LOL.. But, the government has done other things to shoot itself in the foot, like creating TOR and making it open source. Im glad they did, but TOR has caused nothing but grief for the government.

I agree with this scam. It's the best way to spread BTC. It will grow in an arithmetical progression.
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:48:10
I already asked alot of websites to accept Bitcoins. All of them responded with "Thank you, we'll consider it!"and nothing has changed 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:16:49
Interesting info. Thx you guys
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:14:44
Ooh, interesting information. Now we can see what prices are real

They developed "a Bank level encrypted transaction comments and encrypted messenger feature" in decentralized network. Only receiver can decrypt his message, just with his keys. Each message sending is proved by entire network and encrypted messages are stored in DarkNote blockchain."
And that's really cool. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:11:39
Ohh, i see what you did here, Winklevoss twins (c) =D
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:51:52
I'll add Netflix to my list of useful places where bitcoins are accepted
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:09:51
No. it's not. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:31:26
CNN is the worst source to know news. It's the best propaganda channel and they're trying to influence on us. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:38:27
Electronic payment systems are way ahead of us
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:21:39
Just like that guy from DarkNote (former ducknote)
@_date: 2014-04-27 14:20:13
First they ignore Bitcoin, then they laugh at Bitcoin, then they fight Bitcoin, then you it wins.
Simple as that.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:04:35
You want to deal with crimes by using a crime?
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:40:57
I'd like this to be a real 'big thing'. But maybe it's about far away bitcoin future
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:37:16
You guys made my day. Thx you
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:38:42
better say whistleblower instead of caller
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:48:39
It will never be a problem for a system if one of its chain doesn't work well. You should just replace it with another one element.

When I was travelling to the Europe I got some euros from the bank, they gave me 4*500, and I thought - well, not a big deal.
This was a thriller - how to starve to death and live on the street when having 2000 euros in your pocket. Useless banknote.
