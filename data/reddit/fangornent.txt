They are saying that China waking up will add more of their own volume since majority of them are asleep right now. America pumping is the cause.

Same as with your paper money in a wallet. Protect yourself.

You obviously are very knowledgeable about the subject!  
It is not a bad thing that each coin would have individual purposes with some being stronger in areas where others are weak. That is called growth.  
You wouldn't take a gold bar into the store to pay for your groceries. That does not mean gold is bad, just that there are better options.  
Stay biased though.

And I find it funny that the president of BFL tried to say that the FTC was waging war against them and bitcoin..  
Maybe if you weren't a complete scumbag they'd leave you alone. Other ethical mining companies seem to be doing just fine.

No pump/hype intended, just trying to have an open discussion on crypto.  
As I said, I do not think money transfers will be the main purpose for btc as there are better options. That does not take away the value or other uses from bitcoin.
Carry on with the cognitive dissonance.

Just being realistic here..but bitcoin is flawed in certain aspects.  
Ripple fixes some of these aspects with instant transactions as well as a ledger that is growing out of this world. In the last two months it has almost doubled. Check it out [here](  
This is not a hype post or anything like that. I truly think that people are missing the value of ripple. It was made to be a medium of exchange and you can already convert between almost every major currency as well as precious metals. Not to mention backed by three banks as well as google funding.  
It is the pioneer that you hear about years down the road, not the settler. While bitcoin is a good way to transfer assets it is lacking. I see it as a store of value asset that you can easily spend rather than a service to transfer money around the world.

If you actually learn about trading you will notice these patterns in EVERY market. The waves happen due to a few different factors but yes, human emotions are one of the key factors.  
That said, learn some technical analysis and stop relying on emotion during your trades. Check out [this]( emotional cheat sheet. It happens so much that it's crazy.  
That does NOT make bitcoin bad or a scam or anything similar. It is what it is..you are just now realizing what happens. Saying that this is a bad thing is like saying stocks are bad. Learn to use these patterns and human emotion(sheep mentality) to your advantage.

I am talking ledger growth, not btc ratio(though yes it doubled recently). To go from 1.3 billion value to 2.5 billion in a month and change is insane.

BTC/USD. If you look at the fraction and compare the numerator and the denominator you will figure out why we're going down. As your denominator grows your numerator....

you would need some way to log into the wallet/account with that address.

[Here]( is an example of how the USD impacts all assets in it's bull wave.

Nice read. Really like the visual representation of the Hash as well as the exponential state that the process is currently in. People always seem to want instant results, meanwhile missing the larger picture.

If you know the price is going down, why not sell and then buy back at a lower price? You gain btc and lower your average price.  
Unless this was not money that you could afford to lose/have sit.

Thanks..Though I practice my own TA and base my trades off of that. I hope it helps others though. Levels look decent to me :).

Nice analysis. Refreshing to see more neutral standpoints instead of the saying that the price must do this or that.
