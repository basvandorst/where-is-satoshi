Don't you have to complete a transaction to move coins from a legacy wallet to a segwit wallet? For an exchange with hundreds of thousands of legacy wallets moving to segwit would be extremely costly.

No offense, but I never believe stories like your hairdresser's. Buying Crypto is hard! 
He liquidated his assets, got a verified account on a fiat exchange, got a verified account on an altcoin exchange, went to a bank and sent a wire transfer to the fiat exchange, bought BTC, transferred that BTC to his altcoin service, and purchased Lisk?

I havent seen any limits in Gemini. I saw someone go from BTC -&gt; $500k -&gt; Bank via ACH within a few minutes. Or course it probably took a few days for the bank to clear the ACH.

Do these people own stocks? There are many folks who just never invest in anything. It is unfortunate because, usually, investing would allow them to share in growth/profits.

Thanks. I fixed it
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:23:13
Just figured, why not? I didn't actually expect any tips.  
Anyway, i didn't realize it was actually against the rules. I've removed it.

That would work but it is a bit costly and inconvenient. Wish there was another service like Coinbase I could use.

Celebrities legal right to privacy is much more conservative than that of private citizens. So, I would agree that they sold (most of) their privacy for millions of dollars.
@_date: 2014-09-01 19:50:14
I never claimed the actions surrounding this leak were legal or justified. I was replying to the statement that celebs have the same privacy rights as private citizens.
@_date: 2014-02-15 21:57:50
I am afraid to spend my BTC because my last 7 attempts to purchase Bitcoin from Coinbase have been denied due to 'high risk.' I'm just a normal dude from the US who has his bank account and credit card linked. And I've made purchases and sales in the past. I tried customer support several times but they are unhelpful.
Is there another similar service that works well in the US?
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:05:53
Privacy rights dont apply to public figures [celebrities] the same as they do for private citizens. -- Not saying this leak wasnt a violation, just that there are differences in privacy rights.

What happens when the paper is lost, smudged, burned, or stolen? I don't think I would want to trust $100k to a piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:32:14
Dont hate me for going this route -- but I think another option is a FDIC insured 3rd party. Sure, you may not have 100% access to all your coins, but they are insured by the US govt. Then the only thing you have to worry about is the govt declaring them illegal and freezing your account before you can withdraw.
@_date: 2014-09-01 18:47:39
Perhaps your location has different laws than the US.. or you are just a terrible law student :) 
There are many cases that uphold this precedent. Here's more details from a quick google search.

I would understand your point if the merchant had delivered. But isn't this a perfect example for a chargeback? GAW sold something they did not provide.

That is a good idea. Maybe I'll look into a system like this.

Twitter has a set of rules for use of its services. If anyone breaks these rules they face temporary or permanent bans. Twitter is perfectly within its rights to take these actions. Would you claim Club Penguin was violating free speech because it didnt let you curse?

Assassination by car seems pretty far fetched. Even if they could activate the brakes or accelerate suddenly the chance that you would be injured or killed by this event is extremely small. 
If the event is triggered randomly the likely event is a small collision with no injuries. If they somehow wait till you are in a dangerous situation, such as driving 70 on a highway, your chance of injury increases but chance of death is still relatively small. 
tl;dr Assassination by hacking a car seems like a lot of work for a low chance of success when compared to assassination by gun.

I used a system that mined whichever crypto had the best rate of return then immediately traded it for BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:14:44
Yep! Although you usually earn more from direct purchase than mining I believe not knowing the exact price of everything you mine makes you more likely to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:36:01
People mine in extremely large pools that distribute the funds based on how many "shares" you contribute. Also, the reward used to be much higher. When I mined they were 25 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:37:57
Definitely more efficient, but I feel like if you mine it you are less likely to sell at the first spike, cause you worked for that BTC!
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:41:08
I remember running 2 Radeon 7850s and earning 0.2 BTC per day, but stopping a month later because rewards fell to 0.05 BTC/day. That was a poor decision.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:59:11
What hardware wallet do you use?  My ledger just required a software update and it then supported both the BTC and bch blockchains in separate wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:38:38
Good to hear you gave it life after working the mines.

Years ago I lost 1 BTC with stupid sports bets. I was furious with myself. Fortunately, i spent $400 and bought a couple BTC to replace the one I lost.

Thanks! Your description is better than any of the help info I could find on their site.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:26:07
I might break my funds up a bit, but I don't mind storing smaller more easily accessible amounts on blockchain.info.

Unlike fiat, no entity can flood the market with BTC and tank its value.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:17:00
Transfer whatever amount you plan to spend to a software wallet on your phone or laptop. Think of you ledger like a safe while your software wallet is your billfold.

They banned crypto ads for a few months because there were too many scams being promoted. The removed this ban as soon as AI was better trained to detect and prevent scams.

That would cost money. Currency based on faith is free.

I understand your point. Any unnecessary risk is  probably a bad idea.

It would be more trustworthy if it did not attempt to use the bitcoin brand to trick buyers into thinking they are getting BTC and actually giving them BCH.

But who determines how much your BTC is worth? It sounds like the kind of silly law that is practically impossible to enforce, which means nobody follows it.

I'm sure the city has already spent more than 51k on security agencies to recover the data.

I believe in the situation you described you would owe capitol gains taxes on the $9000 when you claim a $10000 donation. However, you would receive a $10000 deduction so you would more than cancel out the taxes owed.

Cool. I had drinks with Andrew a couple months ago. Wish I had thought to ask him about bitcoin.

What if you sold your iPhone and came into the bank with $800 but the bank said "we dont accept cash from the sale of iPhones?"

To be fair, I think there are different rules if the bank is not providing a Freddie Mac/Fannie May loan and the loan is bank direct.

They require bank statements from the last 2 months. It is silly because all the docs would be easy to Photoshop. But I'm not going down that road.

I was sharing personal experience that may help others if they are ever in the same situation. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:36:29
Haha - That would be a lot of plasma. I think we did find a way to make it work and leave my BTC in storage.
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:19:29
Yeah. It is silly. If I owned a car or jewelry that I sold for $, that would be perfectly fine. But since BTC isnt 'real' it can't be used as a funding source.

I ended up keeping them because I couldn't use them for reserve funds anyway. Lets hope you're right.

I don't believe they can stop libra either. They may be able to block the Facebook managed wallet called Calibra that is used to hold your libra, but...
1) A VPN would probably render any block useless
2) There will be thousands of other wallets to choose from. You can use libra without any connection to FB.
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:19:26
They require the reserves to also be seasoned funds. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:17:41
And you do understand that making 'seller financing' a requirement in a house search would cut your options down from several hundred homes to possibly 1 or 2.
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:22:20
They need to trace the funds to their source with bank statements. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:15:24
We had enough for the down-payment but the bank wanted us to have 6 months of cash reserves. And they would not allow me to use my BTC as reserves even if I cashed them out to USD since they were not 'seasoned funds.'

Why would he toggle at all? The price of Bitcoin isn't affecting his mining. Even if he is mining at a loss, if the price goes up his previous mining will have been profitable... Unless he is instantly cashing out or something stupid like that.

There are approx. 10 million BTC in existence. I would estimate less than 200,000 people own BTC. That is 0.002857142% of the population.

At 1400 mega-hashes you should earn around .15 BTC per day. Not a bad sum, but not close to the 7.47 BTC/day you have pulled up in your mining calculator.

In my opinion, cash suffers from a similar problem -- If too many people know where it is stored it could be stolen. If no one knows then it is lost.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:50:30
I played the odds against online casinos that offered bonus money for joining. They would double your deposit but you had to gamble it like 10 times before you could cash out. I would play $2 blackjack until I hit the requirement and cash out. I have a spreadsheet that calculates I won nearly $10k from over 100 casinos during the 4 years I was in college... but if you calculate the amount of time it took, I probably only earned like $20-30/hour.
TL DR -- If you gamble with math you can win.
