Well they are allowed to ask for things like directly paying a bill. Say like their electricity is going to be turned off tomorrow. They could ask for help paying that bill. But the money must be paid to the electric company.

Thank you. It seems like that is the general consensus.

Will do. Thank you.

Yea the people are asking for themselves. That is why I am asking the question. So it sounds to me we should consider them as asking for a monetary request not going  to charity.

Thank you. That clears a lot of things up for me.

Makes sense. Thank you.

Looks like I've been schooled pretty well already. I love the quick and honest response by your community. Everyone was extremely helpful and right to the point. You don't see that in a lot of reddits around here.

You are addressing my main concern. We do our best to keep people like that way who are taking advantage. It is the very reason for the 90 day rule.
Thanks for that input. It is very helpful.

Thank you for that advice. It sounds like we should consider them as money. We allow people to ask for money but they must have 90 day account. We don't want people making up accounts just to ask for them.
