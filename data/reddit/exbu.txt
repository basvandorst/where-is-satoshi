Personally I buy them at Bitonic.nl you do however pay more for your bitcoins then you would pay if you buy them directly of Kraken.com
The advantage is the speed and if there is something wrong you can just easily give them a call. There company is in Baarn.

I didn't know about the topic on bitcointalk. Still he can download the app from the Google PlayStore and test it out himself. 'Blockchain.info' is the developer and on blockchain.info's official blog it links to the app.
If not trusted he can always fork the app from github and make his own version of it and read the source code.
I don't think blockchain.com is a scam, I think the old advertisement link on Google let to another website. The link on blockchain.com leads to the same app in the Google AppStore as the link on the article on Coindesk.

Google Translate: 
All 33 employees of the digital trading platform BTC Direct will receive a part of their salary in bitcoin from next month. Unique in the Netherlands, claims the company that buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of its customers.
You just have to take a look at the course of the bitcoin to see how erratic the price trend is. On the 6th of May, 1 bitcoin scored just under 10,000 dollars, now the digital currency is under 8000 dollars.
With a bit of bad luck, the crypto investor lost part of his deposit next day. BTC Direct employees know the whip and are not awake. Not even if some of their own hard-earned money will evaporate.
The employees received an e-mail a few months ago asking whether they wanted to receive part of their salary in bitcoins and if so, for what amount. The result: everyone wanted to participate and on average for an amount of 100 euros per month. The minimum amount is 20 euros and the highest 500 euros.
There was no question of peer pressure, spokesman Jerrymie Marcus of the trading platform emphasizes. "To be honest, only enthusiasts who also act from idealism work here."
It is not surprising that the plan does not come from the management, but from employees. One of those people is 33-year-old Roy Spies. He has studied leisure management and has been working at BTC Direct for a year at the customer contact department.
,, I buy a few hundred euros of cryptocurrency every month. I find it convenient that this will automatically be done later. And it saves me transaction costs of 2 percent, "says the employee from Tiel. He has opted for a monthly amount of 300 euros. According to the current price, that would be 0.043 bitcoin. ,, I admit: that may sound very little, but all in all it is a nice amount. ''
Despite his enthusiasm, he does see a few downsides. One is that BTC Direct purchases at a fixed time in the month. That may be just at a time when the price is unfavorable. "But on the other hand, it can also be just at a favorable moment," he adds.
Another disadvantage, he thinks, is that BTC Direct only pays out in bitcoin. ,, In addition to bitcoin, I also have other digital coins such as ether and litecoin. I would also have liked to choose another digital currency. ''
Spies thinks that his boss does this very well. He believes that the bitcoin will be around 100,000 euros by 2020 and will become an accepted payment method worldwide. ,, Then it is nice that I already get paid a part in bitcoin. ''
In the Netherlands, BTC Direct seems to be the first company that gives employees bitcoins. Dutch law does have one restriction: an employer must pay at least the minimum wage in euros. Anything that exceeds that amount may be paid in bitcoin. In Germany and Japan there are also companies that pay their employees bitcoin. Meanwhile, more than half a million Dutch people have bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

Put 90% of your bitcoins in cold storage (paper wallet) and encrypt that private key with a BIP-38 encryption. You can put that in the cloud.
Does your multibit back up have a password on it? And do you use 2FA on your Google Account? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:40:54
Maybe want to consider putting it in cold storage. And do you use Windows? If so maybe you have key logger malware on your computer. 
You can check it by downloading Malwarebytes - antimalware.  they are a trusted company (Google them) the free version finds pretty much any malware on your computer but if you want the pro version you can even buy it using bitcoin. 
Make sure you are on their official website! (check http**s**)

Are you kidding me? The Hive team has been FANTASTIC for bitcoin, they offer a free, **opensource** wallet on both Mac OSX and Android already and they don't keep the private keys on those. All of their products are beautifully designed and take a lot of handwork.
Coinbase is a commercial company and guess what you don't own the private keys at Coinbase.

Great comment. I still use a Mac and iPhone but have tested several Linux Distro's and Elementary OS is really awesome!
Also I support several opensource/free (free as in freedom not in price) like the GIMP, LibreOffice and Blender and all of them accept bitcoin for donations. Free software is in my opinion just not on the same level as many closed software and to be honest that is the reason why I don't use it a lot. 
However I wish it was and by donating every ones in a while I hope in a couple of years I fully make the switch to OSS and Free software. It's definitely the future.

Couldn't agree with you more, just look at the Hive Wallet for OSX. It looks fantastic and it is opensource licensed under the GNU. Same goes for several other wallets. 
I have helped several people make the switch from Windows (XP) to a Linux Distro (mostly Lubuntu) and they love it, these aren't tech savvy people. Elementary OS is only making this better by offering a great UI.

Really if you want to keep your bitcoins savings safe there is only one option: Cold storage paper wallets.

You can buy them of several company's. These companies are not exchanges. Bitonic.nl or Bitplaats.nl are both companies that sell bitcoin, they have there own stock of bitcoins. 
I interviewed Bitonic at their location and they are a really trusted company. They also have bank accounts at several major Dutch banks like ABN Amro and ING. 
There is a risk of charge backs for Bitonic and Bitplaats but I'm not sure how they deal with them.

If you ever import the paper wallet into for example Blockchain.info's wallet make sure you empty your wallet completely! Don't leave any bitcoins in it cause a paper wallet can only be imported ones.
You might want to encrypt the private key with a BIP-38 encryption, so you can have copies of the private key. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:44:56

It's short sighted. However I like paying with bitcoin, for me in most situations it's faster than paying with my debit card online.
90% of my bitcoins are in cold storage, the other 10% I use for (online) payments. I don't see any advantages (yet) to pay with bitcoin at brick and mortar store's. (maybe if I get a discount from the retailer)
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:53:08
Coinbase isn't a scam. However you don't want to keep 6k worth of bitcoin on Coinbase. I'm recommending a paper wallet.

Well I spend bitcoin every week on my VPN service, hosting of my website and my local pizza place. It feels great!

Could it be that maybe you have tried to login on a website that looks like blockchain.info but wasn't. There have been several reports of fake blockchain.info website's that use Google Adsense and they become the number 1 result on a Google search. 
If so, to avoid this you might want to consider putting blockchain.info as a bookmark. 
If it's a hacker he will probably use the Tor network or a VPN, both of them give the hacker another IP address.
By the way: in security settings on your blockchain wallet you can block Tor IP addresses. 
I would personally move the funds to cold storage, and keep a smaller amount in your blockchain wallet; like 0.1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:11:13
Yes! :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:43:42
Really you should read more about bitcoin if you have all these questions and want to buy 6k. Especially about bitcoin security. 
However to answer your question; If you do not control the private keys (and you don't if you use Coinbase) you do not own the bitcoins in my opinion. So buying them of Coinbase in several smaller transactions  sending them to a personal wallet - like Multibit or a paper wallet is a good option.
Wanne know more about paper wallets? Watch: 
Personally I use several bitcoin wallets. I use Pheeva and Coinjar (iPhone user) as hot wallets and keep the amount in them under 100 USD. I also the Hive Wallet and Multibit and keep the amount in them under 300 USD. And last but not least I use VersoCards and a paper wallet for my savings ;)

Why do you have to wait 3 days to receive your bitcoins? 
You might want buy your bitcoins somewhere else and directly send them to a wallet you control like Copay, Mycelium or Electrum. If you don't control the private key, you don't 'own' the bitcoins.

In my opinion the best one is a paper wallet made offline. You get a USB and put Ubuntu on it, download bitadress.org website from the Github page 
Live boot Ubuntu and **do not** make a connection to the internet. (you don't need an internet connection to make a bitcoin wallet) Run the website of bitadress.org locally in your webbrowser and make your own bitcoin wallet with a public and private key. Print it out with a 'dumb' printer that does not keep cache and does not have an option to connect to the internet.
That's pretty much it. Btw:  that video might help you out!

You might want to scan your computer for viruses and malware. Malwarebytes anti-malware is in my opinion a solid option. The free version is good enough. 
You also might want to check your webbrowser for extensions that you did not install.
And remember bitcoins that you do not own bitcoins on an exchange like Coinbase. You only own your bitcoins when you have control of the private key with wallets like Copay, Mycelium and BreadWallet.

Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a protocol, capitalization can be confusing. Accepted practice is to use Bitcoin (singular with an upper case letter B) to label the protocol, software, and community, and bitcoins (with a lower case b) to label units of the currency.

Coinbase allows you to send bitcoin to an e-mailadress and people can claim those bitcoins on their website. I am not sure if both e-mailadresses should be linked to a Coinbase account though. However I would recommend you always send bitcoins to a direct bitcoin address so you have the blockchain as proof.

Blockchain.info CANNOT acces your bitcoins. The encryption is all done within your browser, before it is saved on their servers.
Your recovery phrase allows you to restore your wallet in case of loss of password.
* Can you login to your own wallet? 
* Have you logged in and were the bitcoins moved to a different address? If so all to the same adress?
* Do you have your wallet seed (phrase)?
* Did you enable 2FA?
* Did you use the new HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet or the old one? 
* Have you already checked your webbrowser for weird extensions?
* Do you use an adblocker? (yes this is a relative question) Proof --&gt; 
Please answer these questions, we (might be able to help you.

For both Windows Phone and iPhone: Copay. 
Why Copay?
* For every new transaction a new public address  (you can of course still receive bitcoins on the 'old' addresses)
* Multiple Wallets all in one app
* Multiple signatures wallets
* Copay is a true bitcoin wallet, not an account service
* Open Source
* Available on Android, iOS, Windows Phone, OS X, Windows, ChromeOS and Linux. 
* Last but not least, easy backup with a seed (12 words)

ONLY invest money that you can lose. Honestly I would first get to know bitcoin with small amounts of bitcoins. 
Protecting and securing your bitcoin is also a serious subject that you should not underestimate. You only 'own' bitcoins in a wallet were you control the private keys. Preferably when investing a lot of money you should look at cold storage vs hot wallets and know the difference. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:00:02
I was afraid of that. Honestly i think he did receive the coins and also claimed them, his Coinbase account has more than one public bitcoin address so apparently they weren't send to 1FBsQeFG2GKKWNyqLDYNZ9ioBdhKZFVTDK. 
Maybe he is willing to make a screenshot of his incoming transactions on that specific date. For example:

You can change the 'bits' to BTC, swipe from the left (if you are using Copay on a phone) and get to 'Settings' and change 'Unit' to BTC. 
Well with Copay you truly own your bitcoin because you own the private key, it is much more safer. Circle is a great service for buying bitcoin but i wouldn't storage large amount of bitcoin on it.

You could just sell them online on an exchange? Like Kraken or GDAX. Paypal is not a very good option for selling your bitcoins, people can always claim their money back with Paypal.

Fun fact is that bitcoin wallets don't store bitcoins, they only store the keys that enable you to move bitcoins on the blockchain from one address to another. 
But to answer your question, with the seed you can re-create your wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:42:02
No they don't have acces. Blockchain.info provides a so called hybrid wallet. Blockchain.info only stores encrypted data, with no acces to it.  It is not a hosted wallet service/exchange like Coinbase.
The only risk left is that your computer was compromised. Which is YOUR responsibility. But still we might be able to help you if you answer the above questions. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:42:12
I don't have any personal experience with Trez but i hear it is pretty good. The most secure way to store large amount of bitcoin is an so called 'cold storage wallet' for instants a paperwallet. This video will learn you a lot about that:  his YouTube channel is a great source for learning some more advanced things about bitcoin. 
Learn might want to learn the difference between a 'hot wallet' and a 'cold storage wallet' - a hot wallet is a wallet that has acces to the internet; it's great for spending small amounts of bitcoin. A cold storage wallet isn't connected to the internet and used for storing large amount of bitcoins for a long time. 
But yes spreading BTC over multiple wallets is a solid security option. Always make sure you keep your computer safe if you store bitcoins on your computer. Some tips for keeping your computer safe:
* Use an adblocker (like uBlock Origin)
* Check installed add-ons in your webbrowser, remove those that you do not know
* Use a malware/virusscanner, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is a great malware scanner (the free version is good enough)

Copay is one of the easiest wallets to use. If you want to receive bitcoins on your Copay wallet, on the receive tab (bottom left) it 'forces' you to write down your wallet seed (12 words). So if you ever lose your phone you just take another device, download Copay and fill in the 12 words and can have acces to your coins. 
The nice thing about Copay is that for every new transaction it gives you a new public address. You can of course still receive payments on the 'old' public address. A bitcoin wallet can have more than one public address, in fact it can have hundreds. These video's might help:
Your email is not your public address. ChangeTip is just a really nice service for tipping people, you can get your bitcoins out of ChangeTip and send them to your own wallet; like Copay or Bitcoin Wallet for Android. A public address looks something like this:
Your public address is unique, so it is **not** the one above.

You can make as many addresses as you want, if you like your privacy you could make a new address for every transaction. So 1 wallet can have 100 addresses. Remember everyone can look up your address in the blockchain and check the balance and it's history.
Just curious why did you choose the Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-18 08:57:46
Copay bitcoin wallet. It's is a 'real' bitcoin wallet where you hold the private keys and it is very easy to backup in case you lose your phone. Also it has a very simple UI and supports a lot of technologies like HD (hierarchical-deterministic).

Let me be very clear blockchain.info did NOT steal your bitcoins and your really should stop blaming them. When you look at the address your bitcoins were send to:
 351TWiGxe7H33m9**Pnwt**873EBeDJEnvbgcK
First of all the 'Pnwt' part doesn't need explanation. Second the address starts with a 3 which means your bitcoins were send to a multi-signature wallet; most likely a group of hackers stole your bitcoins. Your devices were compromised, not blockchain.info. Your devices so your responsibility.

If you don't care that people can check the balance of that specific adres on the blockchain then sure. Personally I wouldn't care. 
I recommend you get a wallet that creates a new address for every transaction, of course you can still use the old addresses.
This text from bitcoin.org might help you:
*Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records. Various mechanisms exist to protect users' privacy, and more are in development. However, there is still work to be done before these features are used correctly by most Bitcoin users.*
*Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Bitcoin. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems. Bitcoin cannot be more anonymous than cash and it is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. Additionally, Bitcoin is also designed to prevent a large range of financial crimes.*

If you use the same address each time you receive funds, it becomes easy for anyone to track your entire payment history. So BTC.com creates a new bitcoin address for every transaction to give you more privacy. The old addresses are still valid.
@_date: 2017-04-20 04:42:32
You might want to transfer the bitcoins to a wallet you control, for example the Copay wallet. 
Make sure your computer is safe (scan it with a virusscanner) and make sure you make a solid backup of the Copay wallet. 
The backup is a 12 word recovery phrase, also known as the recovery seed. Write these words down on a peace of paper and NEVER share them with anyone else.
I think  is also available in Canada. You might want to sell your bitcoins to them after you have transferred them to Copay.

In theory, as long as blockchain uses the same seed standard as the wallet you want to recover it in, you can recover it.
Example I use the Copay wallet and with the comes the 12 word recovery phrase, I can enter the 12 words and recover my wallet in Multibit HD. It is not really 'sweeping' it is importing your wallet into a different client.
I'm not sure what standard Blockchain.info uses, but you might want to do some testing.

Your back up Recovery Phrase/seed is for your whole wallet. Blockchain is an hierarchical-deterministic (HD) which means that all you 50 random addresses are backed up as long they are in the same wallet.
It is very important to keep your Recovery Phrase offline in a safe and private place. Anyone with access to your Recovery Phrase has access to your funds. A 'hacker' does not need your password or 2FA if they have your Recovery Phrase.

Private keys are the keys that give you the right to send bitcoins and move them around in the blockchain. With Coinbase you don't hold your own private keys but with a wallet like Copay you do.
If you create a bitcoin wallet you don't need an online service, you can manage your own wallet in a piece of software (like Electrum or Copay) or on a hardware wallet (like Trezor and KeepKey). If you create your own 'true' bitcoin wallet you get a private key. (most recent wallets have a recovery seed, which is kinda like a private key).
The advantage of holding your own private keys is that if an online wallet like Coinbase goes offline, you have not lost your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:10:57
I own a Keepkey, Ledger Nano S and the Trezor. All of them are great, but if I had to choose: Ledger if you also want to hold bitcoins, litecoins and ethers. And if you only want to hold bitcoins I would recommend the Trezor.

If you use the same address each time you receive funds, it becomes easy for anyone to track your entire payment history. So the Ledger wallet create a new bitcoin address for every transaction to give you more privacy.

I think you can also pay over the LN at Cafe van Ouds in Nijmegen. They also use BitKassa. :)
