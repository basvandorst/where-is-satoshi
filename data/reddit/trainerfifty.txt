144 thousand X 100 thousand = 14 billion dollars, that's in world economic sense absolutely fucking nothing for that wallet to be worth a trillion dollars bitcoins would have to trade for 9 million usd a pop do your maths right plzkthanks.

bought a pair of seinheisser HD headphones about 2 years ago for about 10000 bitcoins back in the day the exact figure i cant remember but something like that. more recently my beutiful and awsome ASUS G75 laptop from a friend i met on eve online for 20 bitcoins back when they were at about 100 dollars a pop. Most recently I bought 10 1 KILO bars of silver bullion for about 9 bitcoins cashing out a little while avoiding fiat. thankfully i am very pro spend the bitcoins and top up the wallet afterwards, so fortunately the headphones on my head right now aren't worth 10 million dollars. 
also from my previous post bagging me out for loosing 200k after the $850 to $650 dollar price drop , look at me now :P that said the fluctuations of the fiat bitcoin pairs mean nothing to me, fiat is baseless and not a true indication of worth anymore, I would rather consider the purchasing power of my coins and as this post demonstrates they do their job! :)
