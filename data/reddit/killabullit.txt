Right now I think a more pertinent question is: will  bitcoin legacy in its current form survive to 21 million coins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:31
Yep, already $15k

Most likely down....

My point is newbies won’t have a clue who Jihan is but will know what Jihad is. This can only damage adoption.

Bitcoin’s value both as a system and in terms of its dollar value relys on adoption. Using the term jihad, that in the real world is causing so many horrible problems, is not going to attract new people; it will scare them off. Not a smart move.

I don’t hodl because I spend my money on things.

If that’s true, from the view of a speculator it shouldn’t matter which currency you invest in as they will all go up and down the same.

They should get rid of everyone and everything that competes or disagrees with me..... seriously.  What a load of nonsense. The whole point of crypto is that anyone can do whatever they like and what they produce will fly or fall on its merits.  Methinks people should focus on getting their own ducks in a row before pointing at the flaws in others.

Thanks for the clear feedback.

Pretty sure wwtbam starts with a small number and goes up not the other way around. Surely the name “Who wants to get in  and lose most of their stack” would be more appropriate.

I’m very happy to see that it doesn’t have hodl on it.

Well done, you managed to write a post without using caps.
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:16:42
Did you learn to write in caps from Trump?
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:17:52
Does that mean Batman should also be given

You have too much time on your hands....

Good for you, listen for the sound of one hand clapping
