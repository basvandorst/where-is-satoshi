@_date: 2012-04-21 02:54:31

Is it normal for all of the comments(related-tweets) to looks like they've been paid for? or is it just IBM requiring their employees to retweet/comment on the post to make them look better? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:00:15
as long as they all show 70015 as their current version?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:47:00
Are you just banning any peers that aren't on the latest version of bitcoin core?

The cards are still made by ATI.

While the 5830s use a bit more power, the performance gains more than make up for it.
the 5830 can be found for a little bit more than the 5770 and can do 300+Mh/s.
@_date: 2011-06-24 01:53:15
interesting...this would solve some of my issues.
@_date: 2011-08-16 03:02:59
oh, lol.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:20:59
I saw that, but they disappeared before I could order one. =\

People saying to stay away are just hoping to increase their profit, by keeping others away.
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:10:27
they cost a bit more, but still look like a good option.
@_date: 2011-08-03 17:45:28
everytime bitcoins take a hit, its because mtgox fucked something up.
@_date: 2011-06-30 03:33:52
some of the miners have safetys you can set.
So if the temp hits 'X' degress it will pause the mining until it cools down.

for Canadians : VirtEx.
Been using them for a couple weeks now.

I only have money in the account, because I earned some bitcoins, then sold them.
The withdrawn funds into my bank account worked. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:25:18
That would be at the current exchange rate.
The difficulty increasing should also increase the $$$/btc.
@_date: 2011-09-23 04:44:35
Cool.  
Now turn it into a stencil and go spray paint it on every bank you know.

When you have multiple cards running, a 'summary' tab shows up that provides you with the total Mh/s.
@_date: 2011-06-29 22:18:46
The higher the temps, the shorter the lifespan.
60*C is a pretty solid temp range. My cards are running at 75-80*C.
Your fan would probably be the first thing to go, if its running at 100% fan speed for days on end.
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:35:37
stock you'll get ~230-250.
Overclocked i'm getting 299Mh/s.

"Here's an advertisement for..."  
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:51:45
From what I've read, crossfiring your cards makes a big dip in your Mh/s.

Could you guys add paypal support please.
Ive already used your services a couple times, but it would be nice to be able to use paypal instead of give away all my bank info.
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:09:59
From what I found it looked like the 5830 only used a couple watts more than the 5770.

couldn't someone place a large bet on yes, then buy 1 bitcoin for $15 to win the bet?
@_date: 2011-09-04 12:17:23
step one : get my brother to sell one bitcoin for $15.  
step two : buy his bitcoin for $15.  
step three : profit.  
am i missing something?
@_date: 2011-08-08 01:26:26
Using your works electricity for your own profit, good luck finding a new job.

Surely there's a hidden internet stash of these somewhere?!
