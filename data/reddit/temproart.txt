Why dont pepole just call Bitcoin Cash, 'Bitcoin ABC' the 'full node implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol'

Ugh I just checked and yes. I see it again...this time its just the BCH/BTC pair but we know the Coinbase CEO is very heavily slanted towards BCH.

These aren't 'Sky High' interest rates against Cryptocurrency Purchases. We have to be completely honest with ourselves when we try to protect cryptocurrency. JP Morgan, and every single credit card company, charges a different rate for 'Cash Advance' when you use your credit card to buy currency. You see this if you try to 'withdraw' cash from an ATM with your credit card. You see the same if you try to buy currency with your credit card. This isn't any different.
