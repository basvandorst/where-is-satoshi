That reads like the ramblings of an insane person. What am I missing?

Of course it does.


You can absolutely make that argument because it's not your responsibility to prove the server isn't yours. It's not as if your only defense hinges on "ok, so it's mine, but...". Therefore, to begin your defense with "the evidence the prosecution wishes to use is invalid because it was illegally obtained" is perfectly solid and *requires no proof* regarding whether or not the server is yours.
In broader, simpler terms: the government MUST prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that I've committed a crime in order to legally punish me. I don't have to prove shit.
Sadly, due to widespread corruption, that's not the way it typically works. It is the law's intent, though.

So I can walk into your house, grab your valuables, and claim "free market"?
There may be a *slight* flaw in your reasoning...

The burden of proof falls on the accuser, dude; not the other way around.

It's federal law enforcement. They have billions of dollars dedicated to doing shit like this.
I think we can trust they're not that dense.

Money order to CampBX. USPS money orders are secure, anonymous, and cheap. If I mail mine on Wednesday, I usually see the funds in my CampBX account Friday evening. I have not verified my info.

This is not the fault of MtGox. Furthermore, ANY wallet that is simply protected by a username and password is just as susceptible to theft.
It is your fault for not using 2-factor authentication, which MtGox offers. They also make it clear that your wallet is not secure without it.
MtGox has its faults, but I cringe every time I read one of these posts from someone who blames their own negligence and bad luck on MtGox.
For what it's worth, I've been using MtGox extensively for months and the only complaint I have is that their "last price" ticker apparently reflects all currencies rather than solely the one you're using.

Look dude, I'm not attacking anyone. I didn't call him an idiot. I was responding to his suggestion to move our BTC out of MtGox. Feel free to point out anything in my response that is incorrect. Otherwise, go fuck *yourself*.
