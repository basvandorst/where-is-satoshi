DPR was an Internet drug lord processing over a billion dollars much of which was for illegal activity, and who also tried to get people murdered. He's not an innocent bystander.

It's a drug earned asset, which means if the government can get to it, then they can sell them back into US dollars.
This is what they do with cars, homes at auction and the same would be true about any money in their accounts or investments. 
If they feel like the asset is "dirty", they'll take it.

Could you get a wider monitor and do a new screenshot.  I only had to scroll left and right on my phone about 10 times to read each sentence. I was really hoping you could get the whole thing one one line for me. /sarcasm

I would imagine it'd be like any other drug related assets. What do the police do with drug cars....they sell them at auction. Just replace "cars" with "bitcoins", and the auction is the market. Pretty simple.

Yea I'm wondering what proof OP has that the coins weren't transferred

Just a few days ago people were saying he couldn't be found. He probably has his wallets stored in plain sight or easily discoverable with the keys on sticky notes or on his dropbox account.
And it's not like the FBI, Homeland Security have a bunch of morons on their hands. They've been monitoring him for LOONG time now. They know where he keeps things stored and exactly how he's been doing it. I wouldn't be surprised if they used keyloggers on the computers he used, tapped the line, and/or monitored him in the cafe. If Homeland Security is involved, privacy laws as you and i know them, go out the window. They likely know every key press he has typed for the last several months.

so long as you're on the winning side :)

And you don't think the FBI and Homeland Security have the ability or have been monitoring him long enough to know exactly where those are stored and every password he's typed for the last several months?

It's true if there's not another copy of the wallet
