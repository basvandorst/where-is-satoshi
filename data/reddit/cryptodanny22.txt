Exactly what I just said to someone.
He didn’t believe in it when there was a chance to make money. He probably bought at 19,500 and is looking to pump. What an idiot...

These are awful rules. Doesn’t talk at all about investing what you are willing to lose or holding your private keys. Nice try though.

Like this person above takes the time to write you a whole paragraph of exactly what happened. Re read that. It says what the government was planning to do...

Do the opposite of what the government planned to do??? What else?

Are you for real? It’s a perfect example of price arbitrage. Instead of crypto I am using some cheap product as what they are selling. Buying from one place, selling in another.
Do better yourself.

Chilllllllllllllllll. Go to sleep.
Everything will be fine in the long run. You weren’t investing to make a quick return, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:23
Just buy and stay off reddit. You believe in the technology, you don’t need to read these forums and the speculation. You want to make a quick buck, good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:28:19
Can you give me an update on the price, we haven’t talked in 24 hours...
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:51:17
Bye Dash

I think the fact that tons of major companies are actually using it, it means you can trust it. How many banks are using Bitcoin, ETH, BCH? Not as many as Ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:35:19
No, silly, that’s not how it works. 
Do some research.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:46:57
You can, it’s called arbitrage. There are still risks, but theoretically you could. Would help if all BTC transactions were instantaneous.
But it’s possible!

Monero is not supported by Trezor currently. I don’t know about NAV... if it’s ERC20, then you could hold it in my Ether wallet with the Trezor.

So then why do you care? Paper losses. Look at the charts, this has happened many times before, will likely happen again. Just as you did today, HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:00:11
Congrats on getting your money!!! This shows the real good reddit can do!!

It’s like the same thing as a stock split, so hopefully people would not be that dumb. Never know though...
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:13
And if you sell now, you lock in those losses. Right now those losses are all on paper. The minute you sell us the minute you really lose that money. You wait 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, that’s when we will see what really happened. I stand by my comment and am still holding.

That’s false. Islam is one of the only religions that bans earning interest. They don’t believe you should charge one person money to lend them some money when they are in need. 
Bitcoin is just not an interest bearing product.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:59
You are really dumb for saying this after three days of losses, no offense. This is not a coordinated attack, this IS idiots selling out of fear because they put January rent money into crypto in mid December, and they need to cash out now for fear of not having money to pay. 
If BCH goes up and BTC goes down and nothing else happens across crypto, sure, call it an attack. But, my friend, EVERYTHING is red right now. This is a correction. No doubt about it.
When USD trading overtook JPY trading it was clear this was a mini bubble of idiots trying to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:06:23
I don’t see the government raising interest rates to a level to get people to stop putting money in Bitcoin, causing it to crash.
Will it crash? Maybe. But I am not sure in what ways this is at all like what led to the Great Depression.

Wtf are people’s problems with memes?? That’s like saying you do like jokes.

True. I like how these people holding 0.1 BTC are judging this person for buying a car. There is enjoyment and utility gained by buying it. Like this guy said, he’s not waking up at 4 am checking the price anymore. People here are really silly for saying someone is dumb for taking real gains and buying something real with it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:53:15
That’s so dumb. Do you know how many people wear or show signs of their wealth? Jewelry, clothes, handbags, homes... there’s a lot more than just a license plate to give away if someone is wealthy... smh
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:19
Sorry, is there anything that makes that seem like anything other than FUD?
I’m diversified across many cryptos, so you can take your “biases-toward-Bitcoin” accusations and stuff them in a sack.
This is the stupidest “warning” I have ever seen. If it could be done, why wouldn’t they just steal the money and go? It’s FUD until you point some other factual element out.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:10:42
100% agree with this guy...

This is friggin morbid

When it comes to investing the past is never indicative of the future. When you get an investment license, it’s like the first thing they tell you to warn people of. Lol.

It’s like a new savings bond!
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:15:23
Thank you for this. Had this thought many time to do micro trades to build up amount of bitcoin over time. Then I read stuff like this, remember I’m not a trader and simply just HODL. Sorry for your loss but thanks for the lesson!
Edit: I should mention I have done equally silly things, like buying on the Nov 5th peak out of fear it would not come down again... took until this weekend to break even on that position.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:16:00
Who knows, what if the dip you buy in is the one that is on its way down to zero. Buying the dips HAS worked, I agree it will likely work, but hope no one thinks that’s fool proof!

It’s important to apply real life investor principles to crypto investing. One of which is, “it’s not about timing the market, it’s about time in then market.” 
Missing the top trading days “waiting for a dip” is the worst investor move you can make. There’s no way to time the market, especially with something like crypto that has very few underlying quantitative properties that typically lead to valuing an asset/security.
I think the other thing I am starting to realize is to diversify. Need more cryptos than just BTC to make a portfolio. Returns could potentially be higher with BTC only, but risk is increased too.  Would love to hear other people’s Asset Mixes and performance of the portfolio.
I bought BTC over the last month using DCA (unfortunately) and bought some ETH on one day, and hold about 90/10 BTC/ETH and have gained 20% since Oct 16th (had a couple bad buys at the peaks, which increased my ACB).
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:36:28
I think I meant it more in the way like people who can see that are visionaries. There’s a long way to go, like you said, and I am typically a pessimist or at least have that black hat way of thinking off the bat.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:26:17
Based on the number of upvotes you got, I think you understand it just fine...
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:45:51
That’s not that funny...
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:29:16
In that case, this is not a problem. I guess I still don’t see the future as clearly as you guys do yet. I feel there is still some way to go. 
Couldn’t a government just suspend the business license, close the doors, send the sherif over to padlock the shop? The money can be all virtual, but good, clothes, cars are not... the government has and will figure out a way to keep their hands in the assets of the people. Crypto or not...
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:17:24
I love your second paragraph, lol!
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:52:06
Then until then, I don’t disagree, it’s a good strategy for being able to increase your BTC for the same outlay of cash!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:06:39
Every dollar on top of the fees paid and capital outlay.
People ask this question all the time on here and I never weigh in, but I feel like it’s obvious. If you are being honest, you pay tax on every capital gain you make. I am in Canada, so maybe not all countries have capital gains tax, but selling a crypto, or making a gain going crypto to crypto is a taxable event that if being honest, you would calculate and pay your tax on.
The reality with all things is you have to be honest with taxes. Even if you buy Euros from USD, make money on that when you transfer back to USD, you have to pay tax. Does everyone? No. But are you supposed to? Yes.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:17
You might bet on a dip that won’t happen again for a while. A fundamental investing principle is “it’s not about timing the market, it’s about TIME IN the market.”
Of course you could make more if you buy in a dip, but I don’t believe you can ever truly see a dip coming. It’s a gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:46:28
I respect this post!

Government shuts down all your bank accounts, freezes all your assets, outlaws exchanges... how do you get your money out of crypto?
Seems like a pretty effective means of enforcement.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:30:57
Pretty confident none of us would still be invested if we thought we were at the top of a bubble. The only advice you should take on here is “don’t invest more than you are willing to lose”, like LOSE.
If you want to make enough money to retire, .0001 will likely not be enough to do that, however, if Bitcoin returns 300% growth over a given time period, you get a 300% return whether you own .00001 or 100 coins.
Returns are returns.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:14
This is just silly...
There’s a lot that I find interesting about this, but mostly:
Offloading BTC will not crash the world economy. Probably like less than 1% of people even have money in crypto.

If I had 1.8 million today after investing 6kI would cash out. There could be more to gain, but I would take out that 1.8, live off a blue chip dividend paying mutual fund and bam, vacations and retirement!

@_date: 2017-11-26 23:26:17
Totally agree, three major corrections I have looked at, about 30% each time, and things just end up skyrocketing.
In summary, any time BTC goes down 30% buy as much as you can!! The rest of the time, just dollar cost average.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:22:09
What if you sell and it doesn’t dip? It’s a gamble.
HODLers will win over most traders.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:33:18
Not sure, I don’t use Coinbase. I’m in Canada and I use Quadriga. I have thought of doing what you said, but being in crypto to me is risky enough without adding trading to the mix. 
I’m sure I could make more, but I don’t have the risk appetite or want to put in the effort to do it, tbh. I know that sounds lazy, but I am... have to really focus at work all day and have a small kid to spend time with at home. Happy to make the massive gains I have over the last 6 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:10:04
I love looking at the big picture this way. Also, estimates of the total fiat currencies are about 85 trillion. 
That would make each 1 Bitcoin worth just over $4million a pop, if bitcoin replaces fiats. We can all dream that bitcoin replaces fiat one day with numbers like those!!!

You lease it, The Rock.

It’s early days as a currency. There have been houses, boats, cars, drugs, and probably lots of other things purchased with Bitcoin. It also is great for sending overseas and avoiding fees from Banks/Western Union, so in that way it is also like a currency.
I was reading an article about a country that had such short supply of USD on hand that the only way importers could pay their suppliers was to buy Bitcoin and send it to them. 
It’s not like you are buying groceries with bitcoin, but I don’t think it can be fully discounted and a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:12:16
It’s still a capital gain if you transfer from one asset to another if the first asset appreciates in value. Just because you didn’t turn it to fiat, doesn’t mean you haven’t “realized” the benefit of the funds. You have, it’s taxable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:37:48
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:11:48
Tbh, probably best to get an accountant on here to weigh in. If not, in Canada, as a student, I think you can use turbotax to do taxes for free.
If you buy and hold, you won’t have a “taxable event” so you wouldn’t even have to worry.
If you do sell, or trade crypto to crypto and make a gain, then in turbotax, you would input that as a capital gain and pay what it tells you.
In Canada, if you earn income under like 10 or 12 k, you don’t pay any tax. And as a student, you can write off your tuition too.

I believe there are people inventing crypto to fiat exchanges on a blockchain, so you could theoretically avoid web exchanges (the typical shut down point.) I am a noob, but have read a few articles (translation: headlines) about that.
I believe people will always find a way to circumvent the government to be able to pull their money out.
Otherwise there will be mass amounts of tourism or emigration to crypto-havens.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:13
Supply &amp; Demand, plain and simple.
Price goes up when demand outweighs supply (lots of people trying to enter the market.) Price goes down when supply outweighs demand (some whale/lots of people decide to cash out of their purchases or sell their mined coins for cash.)
The difference with Bitcoin is everything is exaggerated. Because there are so many people who are in to make a quick buck, they emphasize these price swings with excitement in both directions. There is overreaction to price increases, causing massive FOMO.
When things start going down, lots of people panic, and unfortunately make the mistake of selling. This increases supply further and reduces the price further. There are only so many stupid people though, and only so many people who want to cash out, so eventually the selling stops, people who understand investing or Bitcoin buy back in during massive drops which corrects the price.
That’s my microeconomic look at crypto fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:42

If you have money, buy the dip.
If you have more money, HODL.
Read all the sob stories of people who didn’t on reddit. Last weekend was tough to sit through. Bit the bullet, sat on my coins, bought a bit more and this has been a fun week watching it all flow back in.
HODL HODL HODL.

This is one website. If you provide a superior product or service, you can call it horseshit and people will buy it.
Who cares what BCHers are doing. BTC has enough shit to deal with, without focusing on mind games played by the other side.
Will some new investors be tricked? Sure! But not all people learn about crypto from this site.
