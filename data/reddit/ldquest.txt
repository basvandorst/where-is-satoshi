Lol, I can prove it if you want me to. I've bought in at $400 in 2014, bought more in 2015 at $200. I laugh at people like you. Poor fools. Screen shot of my coinbase account? what do you want big boy.
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:53:31
Yeah yeah, blah blah, Whaddya want big boy, I'll prove that I entered that market in 2014. Want me to show my Bitcointalk account that I registered in 2014? Me signing a message from my 2014 wallet? A screenshot of my coinbase account? I have proof you handsome big boy, what do you want? Don't ignore my offer of proof. I was the one telling people to buy Bitcoin at $400, and you where the one laughing at it ;)
To explain my post, $400 was my true initial investment, but I bought less than $100. I use 2014 to show how long i've been here ;). 2015 is what I consider to be my actual initial investment, because i bought a majority, 99% of my holdings, at $200.

Don't forget I'm offering proof babe.


No, I taught you that dipshit. You were so speechless, your only response was "Fuck you"
Twas the best time of my life dipshit. I'll always remember it.

Selling Segwit? Im confused, who are the customers in your analogy? Is it the exchanges and is Segwit the product? Segwit reached consensus. We aren't selling Segwit, we are getting the laggards caught up.

I think I know exactly what most of the clues are talking about, I just don't know how to put the pieces together yet... But the think in pairs clue and \+1 has given it away for me.

I’m not sure if maybe he could have deleted it or not but this is the first comment he made mentioning \+1: [
Second reference:
based on those comments it doesn’t seem like the \+1 or \-1 comment was referencing a pass phrase. especially because of the connection of binomial random walks and it relating to two chains, an attacker and honest chain. Hence the”challenging the underlying security model”.
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:15:05
From a seed, not a private key. Its one private key per address. You can have multiple addresses under one seed, but not multiple addresses under one private key. What he said is that OP moving the funds confirms we are looking for a seed because of that, not a private key.

Thank you for asking this, many people here pay no attention to the health of the Bitcoin network. Many people conflate the health of bitcoin with its price, and price should be the least of your worries. So when looking at the health of the Bitcoin network, there are two main things you want to look at:
1: Hashrate
Hashrate increasing is good. This shows that miners are still interested in mining, even if it is not profitable. Hash rate will likely plateau \(has started plateauing already\) and will only rise occasionally. More miners = more secure network. A dropping hashrate would be bad, as it would show miners are jumping ship, and it would effectively decrease the networks security. A lot of people argue \(and argued with the last one\) that after the halving, miners will jump ship and stop mining Bitcoin as their profit would be cut in half.  If there were to be a sudden drop in hash rate, blocks would slow significantly and fees would rise significantly. This is an unlikely scenario, as Bitcoin is designed in a way that this would actually incentivize miners to start mining again, as there will be a significant honeypot due to the increased transactions and high fees sitting in the mempool waiting to be confirmed.
2: Transactions per day
This is the only chart that has been worrisome. Back in the day, this was typically the only chart people referred to. As it showed healthy activity on the network and that adoption was increasing. The transactions per day have been climbing consistently over the last few years. However, recently the transactions per day have fallen off a cliff, so no one refers to this chart anymore as it no longer confirms their biases. Many people on this forum will incorrectly state that the drop off is due to segwit, which is flat out wrong. Segwit does not decrease number of transactions, it only decreases the transaction size. Some will say outputs is a more accurate measurement, which is also wrong. A single transaction can have multiple outputs, so this is a useless chart. Others will say its because of the lightning network. This too is wrong, as its still in its infancy, hardly anyone transacts on the lightning network. Txs per day need to start going up again for Bitcoin to have a bullish future, unless lightning network adoption takes off significantly \(unlikely to happen in the near future\).
The txs /day have been cut in half, which is not a good sign. Now with that being said, there was a similar dip in txs per day during/after the 2013 bubble. So it is possible that txs per day can still continue to climb and show increased usage over the next few months/years. They have been slowly rising since the massive drop\-off, so this is still a good sign as they used to be in the 150k range per day back in march, which is very, very low relative to where we have been. Other than that, a growing hashrate gives Bitcoin a positive outlook as well.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:48:35
Not necessarily. The lightning network doesn't make the Base layer obsolete. There will always be transactions taking place on the Base layer. As a matter of fact, if there were no transactions taking place on the base layer that would be very bad for the miners. As their block rewards continue to decrease, they rely more on transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-05-28 02:40:05
So this is the first time it dipped below since 10/2015? That was one of the best times to buy Bitcoin. The bitcoin price was $200 \- $300 during that month, and after that it hit $400 and never came back down. This is bullish news.
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:09:38
Wow I was not aware they haven't adopted Segwit yet!
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:15:54
Difficulty only rises because there are more miners. The difficulty is adjusted about every two weeks, so the rate of new blocks stays at a steady 1 per 10 mins. If the hashrate wasn't growing, then difficulty would stay the same. If there were miners that quit mining, then difficulty would go down. Whatever it takes to keep new blocks coming in once every 10 mins on average. If regulations were to be put into place, while it would be a bad thing in terms of the freedom of Bitcoin, it wouldn't necessarily harm Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:23:17
Yes you are on the right track. I have been thinking this but I cannot go further, I am stuck So I’ll tell you what I’ve got so far. You are close but wrong about the \+1. OP has now mentioned both \+1 and \-1 and OP has said \-1 is a hint. This is a direct reference to binomial random walks from the Whitepaper, which of course is about the race between two chains. The solution lies within random walks Somehow.

Where did I say this? Quote it dipshit, come on I know you can do that. I never commented on anything Bitcoin-related on reddit back in January Big boy. I was too busy rolling in the euphoria because I entered the market at $400 ;)
Everyone knew the price wasn't sustainable at $15k, only newbie dipshits didn't

How has the puzzle been made easier if its the same puzzle? Now im confused...
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:59:57
One less step is a hint. Solving the puzzle has something to do with Binomial random walks from the white paper
White paper:


Also, from the wiki on random walks \(not Bitcoin related\):


@_date: 2018-05-28 18:42:37
It didnt peak at that timeframe, it was actually the lowest prices it’s been in recent history between $200 \- $300. So this is bullish news because the price just kept climbing afterwards
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:48:21
Lol hey dipshit,  you clearly don't understand Bitcoin.


I'll try to make this really simple for you. **Difficulty is only adjusted once every 2016 blocks.** Price crashes, and this forces miners stop mining. Difficulty is incredibly high at this point. The blockchain slows significantly. Price continues to fall. More people dump due to the slow blockchain too and more miners quit. Whatever miners that are left won't be able to mine the next block as the difficulty is far too high. The blockchain will freeze because the next block cannot be solved, and difficulty won't adjust until 2016 or however many blocks are left to mine. Since it is computationally infeasible for the remaining miners to mine the next block, they stop mining altogether.
This is really a simple concept, you newbie dumb fuck. Glad I could teach you something.


What am I lying about?  You are the one that clearly doesn't understand the Bitcoin blockchain.
Besides the whole cost of production argument, like I said earlier, this will hold true as well:


What do you think is more likely? Crypto will die, or it won't drop that low. Hmmm... I definitely don't think it will die. Must be the latter.
Besides, why do you think the price will drop that low? You are being arbitrary as shit.

@_date: 2018-06-18 03:08:48
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:46:10
This only holds true after the difficulty adjusts. However, if there is a rapid drop off in hashrate due to a crashing price the difficulty will not be able to adjust. It will be far too difficult for whatever miners are left to mine the next block. 
For example, say we are at Block  for this difficulty period. Hash rate drops by 50% due to crashing price. Blockchain slows significantly and price crashes further. It will take the remaining miners a lot longer to solve blocks. Because of this they use more energy, thus mining at a further loss. Say at this point we are at block  for this difficulty period. Further miners leave, because they are losing way too much money. Whatever miners are left will not be able to continue the blockchain as the difficulty of the next block is far too high to solve on their own. Difficulty will only adjust once we hit 2016 blocks. Therefore the blockchain freezes.

Well, it's fairly obvious Bitcoin will not work as a global currency. Deflationary currencies don't work because they encourage hoarding. But this is no reason not to like Bitcoin. What about Bitcoin being a store of value/digital gold? Its fixed supply, security, durability, Deflation, unforgeability, immutability, scarcity and counter-correlation with traditional assets makes it great as an alternative to gold.
More and more people have been adopting this ideology and it is very reasonable. Bitcoin is better than gold in nearly every way imaginable, besides the obvious industrial use cases. Millennials are more apt to buy Bitcoin over gold as well and they will be the ones running this world soon. Over time golds speculative market will continue to keep shifting to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:39:10
Possibly, but crypto markets are very different than any market anyone has seen in the past. Whether its forex, stocks, bonds, etc. Cryptos are subject to far more manipulation due to the lack of regulation, and far more volatility as you know. 
It seems like you don't like Bitcoin very much. Just curious, why is that?
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:15:18
Haha don't bet on it. Unfortunately it's looking more likely than ever that we could be heading into a crypto winter. There are many parallels with the 2014 bubble. It is looking pretty likely we will see sub $6k, possible sub $5k. So far we have only seen a 67% correction. With most Bitcoin bubbles we see a 75% - 90% correction.
EDIT: Why the downvotes lol? More downvotes won't make my statement less true. I don't want it to drop as much as the next guy, but face it there is plenty of room for downward movement. No matter how many downvotes.
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:50:29


Yeah but those are shitcoins. Bitcoin is the only true digital gold with the 21 million supply cap.


Maybe, but Bitcoin has significantly better attributes than gold does in many various ways. Here is a small list of reasons why Bitcoin is better at gold.
transactibility, unforgeability, scarcity, portability, transferability, Immutability, proof of ownership, predictable supply, programmability, security, and Bitcoin cannot be seized. This and the fact millennials would rather buy Bitcoin than gold is why Bitcoin has been succeeding as an alternative to gold.


Wow, I can't believe he banned you for that. That's not cool. However, I too would rather put that money in Bitcoin though. Short term isn't really that Big of a deal, long term is the game. You could have asked that question a few years ago when Bitcoin crashed from $30 to $2 over a few months. Sure if he invested $1 million into Bitcoin at $30 and it crashed to $2 he would have lost a ton of money, in the short term. However, if he would have kept holding and only worried about the long term he would be fine. 


This is true, but gold is very volatile too. It is still down almost 20% from a high back in 2012 and still down from a high back in the late 70s. Bitcoin is only more volatile now because of how small the market is. Its a lot easier to splash around a cup of water than it is an entire ocean. I think the speculative market surrounding gold will continue to keep shifting to Bitcoin... There really is no reason for it not to. Espicially because of Millennials.

I bought my first Bitcoins in 2014, the rest in 2015. Sorry i'm ​​not a 2017/2018 get rich quick newbie. My point is if it does drop under the cost of production, the market will die. Why would miners continue to mine Bitcoin if they are taking massive losses? Someone here isn't very good at math.
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:36:47
No, it won't drop under $2k because its far under the cost of production. The whole market will die if this happens and thats a highly unlikely scenario. If Bitcoin goes to $2k, then ETH would drop below $200, BCH under $250, LTC around $30 and so on. These prices would never recover.
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:20:12


If bitcoin falls that low, the crypto market will never recover. Hate to tell you that bud. It's safe to say Bitcoin will not drop this low. If it drops this quickly it will be a doomsday scenario for Bitcoin. See here:


If Bitcoin crashes this low, every other shitcoin will go down with it. The confidence in the market will be eroded completely, and the cryptospace will slowly fade out and die. Many 2017/2018 newbies came here to get rich quick, and when they see that instead they are losing a shit ton of money, they will cut their losses and never look back.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:19:00
Thank god, we need some more utility besides the obvious digital store of value aspects.
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:29:36
I too wanted to add to this. Energy is hard to move and distribute. Most Bitcoin mining operations take place where there is cheap electricity. Why is the electricity cheap? **Because it’s powered by renewables**. Energy consumption will not continue its exponential increase. Things will plateau (already starting to). Also, mining hardware will become more power effecient. This topic you posted is not an argument but it does have some misconceptions in it.
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:22:43
Dear god not $400. If that happened then I would only be up 100% on my initial investment.
**This is unacceptable.**
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:11:09
What exactly does this have to do with Bitcoin? From the sound of it you got fooled through the traditional fake check scam. You then were going to use that money to invest in Bitcoin? Is that it? This has nothing to do with you "getting scammed through Bitcoin". 
At least that's how your post read. Please clarify.
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:32:39
My point is, it's not going to drop that low. You are dense if you think so. Even if it does, many of us will be fine. It will not drop under 2K, bottom line. That is far too low, way below the cost of production. If Bitcoin drops this low, it will be bad for the whole market. Everything will slump and will likely never recover. The 2017/2018 newbies would not be able to stomach this. They would eventually/slowly end up selling over the years, and they will have a bad taste in their mouth because of crypto. They will never look back and the crypto market will have a long drawn out slow death.
Short the market if you think it will drop.

The only thing I can speculate was that Hal took it from Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, Hals neighbor, and used him as a "drop" to conceal Nicks Identity and/or his identity. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:47:06
This is a fair stance. The way I look at it, is before Hal and Nick went public, they came together and concluded it would be better to launch bitcoin under a pseudonym. The reason for this conclusion is the question, but they must have decided that within the last year of bitcoin development, Hence why Satoshi came out of nowhere. I think they knew this projects potential because they finally got it to work and they solved the one thing stopping digital decentralized digital cash: the double spend problem. They likely knew decentralized cash would undermine governments and other regimes and they wanted to protect their families with anonymity.

Thank you! This really helps with some proof! On that comment he states he is collaborating with Hal finney to "take a stab at implementing bitgold". This proves they were working together on bit gold from 2005 to at least November 2006, and from the sound of that comment, no sign of stopping the development of it. With already a year of development and only two years after that, the most sophisticated digital currency Bitcoin comes out. Maybe they handed the work off to Satoshi to revise it?
