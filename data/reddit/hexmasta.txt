Usually when the page goes down the APIs are still available. 
I would gladly make a trading interface that is separate from theirs but for now I just don't have the time. Maybe if someone donated some btc my way I would be more than willing to take the time to invest.

I'm not quite familiar with the app so I'm wondering: why was it very popular in the first place? Was it popular because it made it easy to send bitcoin using whatever currency? 
Wouldn't places like coinbase suffice or what's wrong with them?

I showed this news to a friend and his response has me thinking as well.  
What's the point of 2FA if you're going to give it away so easily?

No.   I used to work for a financial trading broker that was FINRA and SEC regulated.  It's very likely their accounts team is swamped with issues and likely are waiting on more proof of the transfer.
