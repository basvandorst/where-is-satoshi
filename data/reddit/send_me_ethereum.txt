You are missing the point. Banks don't care about anything other than profit. If they could, they'd bet all money on crypto because that is the earner right now. The problem is the govt. Govts are instructing banks to do or not do crypto. If you want anything to change call your local politician.

Why the hell? Points to a fb ICO if you ask me.

When ever I see a clickbaitey title, which tries to attract me by throwing big numbers, I consider it FUD and move on. If it were legitimate, a clear rationale would have been presented.

Considering that I was just stating an opinion whereas you were insulting me tells me that you are not even erudite enough to give a well thought out argument refuting me, I guess it's still bigger than you.

I am just happy that the collective hive mind has chosen such reliable projects as the top 4-5 cryptos. I mean, we may be dumb individually, but in a group, we do end up making the right choices.

Well how do they know it's 80%? Why not 95%, or 50%? If the article doesn't explain it then there is no meaning. An arbitrary number like 80% just means the whoever wrote it did it for the sake of writing it, and not convey his/her thoughts on the matter.

Well I don't know how to feel about this, sad that this bloke lost his btc! Or happy that adoption of btc is increasing!
