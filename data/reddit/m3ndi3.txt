Thanks so much for this information!! I wanted to create a crypto game and was just concerned what the guidelines were for iOS... this helped me a lot! :D

Wow yah that would make sense!

I did look into BitPagos, and it seemed like that was the only company doing it :/

I'm based in California... I'm starting an online business and want to ship globally. I currently only accept bitcoin, but was thinking how amazing it would be to accept all currencies, and the output would be bitcoin.

Hmm interesting...I know they have a USD wallet.. is there anyway you can accept USD from customers and it goes to your Coinbase USD wallet? That way it could work with the automatic buy options...

Awesome! I'll look into it, thanks for the info!

Ok so I use Shopify, and they have a payments system where they accept credit card and then will deposit those funds into your bank account. I'll just enter bitwage's account and it will exchange and send it to my Bitcoin wallet! Hopefully this works out!!

You should check out ( I think that is what they are trying to achieve in terms of "you can only unlock this if you have NeuCoin" People with NeuCoin can have a special in app purchase in their game that they can flaunt to people, or tell all their friends "ha ha I have this super special unreleased song that you don't have". Flaunting what you buy with digital currency can be shown by people streaming or YouTube, so it's totally doable.

Sorry, for some reason the ads are the first to load, so everything loads after -_-

Bitcoin needs a wallet yes?

No it's more like building a rocket that uses a special type of fuel but only some people carry that fuel.. Then a company says we have a special liquid that will allow you to use regular fuel for your rocket. Do you wait til more people carry the special fuel, or do you get the liquid that converts regular fuel to the fuel you require?

If I bought Bitcoin at $200 and it's now $300 then yes I would prefer the option to use my Bitcoin debit card then a regular usd debit card

It is very tragic what happened... Our [funcoingame]( faucets will be donating to support this cause!

gambit.com does the first things- people can play against each other for bitcoin. It's not an open platform though...

These hacks were hacks on where Bitcoin was held (exchanges, etc), not hacks over the actual currency(creating Bitcoin from nothing). 
So an example would be:
Robbing a bank is like hacking an exchange. You are going to a centralized source and taking money from that (which is why it is never a good idea to store your Bitcoins on exchanges)
And although you can print out counterfeit money, it's my understanding you cannot make counterfeit Bitcoin.
Anyways, people will rob banks all the time, and people will hack exchanges. Exchanges are now becoming more regulated so that in the event a hack does happen, they will be able to reimburse you.

Maybe he can setup an account with bitwage and you just send him the 80k to his bitwage routing number and they will exchange it to bitcoin for you.
