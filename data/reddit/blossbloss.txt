Thank you for the comments.
**Part 1**
Regarding your additional question, I have been treating everything as FIFO per custodial entity. I bought my BTC on Coinbase and also from a local Bitcoin ATM into a smartphone wallet. Had I kept those BTC in the two custodial entities (Coinbase and personal wallet), then I would have treated each entity with their own FIFO accounting. However, I moved everything into a hardware wallet, and use a newly merged FIFO accounting.
So, here is a different example along these lines:
**On January 2, 2016**, you have finally made it through the hoops of Coinbase's KYC/AML process, and pull the trigger on your first bitcoin purchase. You purchase $500 worth of BTC at a price of $435/BTC. You now own  1.14942529 BTC, and you have decided to keep them on Coinbase because you don't trust your own security.
Later that year, you are thinking that you might be able to buy some BTC anonymously, and decide to buy some  with cash at an ATM.
**On September 29, 2016** you activate a smartphone digital wallet and buy $500 worth of BTC. The ATM charges a premium price so you paid $665.50 per BTC (even though the market price was $605.00 that day). You now have 0.7513148 BTC on your digital wallet.
**On November 27, 2016** you decide to get more from the ATM. This time the ATM premium price is $809.60 per BTC (even though market rate was $736.00). You buy $1,000 worth, and that results in 1.23517787.  You now have a total of 1.98649267 BTC on your digital wallet.
You are getting tired of the premium pricing, and having doubts about being able to keep those BTC anonymous from the tax man. You decide to go back to Coinbase for your next purchase.
**On January 23, 2017** you purchase another $1,000 worth of BTC at a price of $925.00 per BTC. You purchased 1.08108108 BTC. You now have a total of 2.23050637 BTC in your Coinbase account.
**Scenario 1**: You keep your Coinbase and smartphone digital wallet accounts separate.
|Date|BTC|Cost Basis per BTC|
*Smartphone Digital Wallet*
|Date|BTC|Cost Basis per BTC|
**Scenario 2**: You move all your BTC to a hardware wallet on June 1, 2017. There is a $2.30 miner fee for moving your Coinbase balance, and another $2.30 miner fee for moving your smartphone digital wallet balance. Since the price of bitcoin that day was $2,375.00 at the time of transfer, each of the two miner fees equate to 0.00096842 BTC. For capital gains calculations, you must use FIFO (First In First Out), so the miner fees comes from the 01/02/2016 Coinbase UTXO, and from the 09/29/2016 smartphone digital wallet UTXO.
Your cost basis of the Coinbase miner fee is 0.00096842 BTC \* 435.00 $/BTC = $0.42 long term capital gain (since that BTC was acquired more than a year ago).
Your cost basis of the smartphone digital wallet miner fee is 0.00096842 BTC \* 665.50 $/BTC = $0.64 short term capital gain (since that BTC was acquired less than a year ago).
When you deduct the miner fees, your hardware wallet looks like this:

|Date|BTC|Cost Basis per BTC|
Let's say it is December 15, 2017 and you are enjoying the rocketship moon ride. But you also want to enjoy some of the spoils of your genius investing.  You decide that $25,000 would make a nice withdrawl given that the price just touched $18,000 per BTC.  You need to sell 1.38888889 BTC to get your $25K.

Thanks for the comments.
I like your thinking about paying yourself under the income threshold. But can you say a bit more about the "rest in shares for the year"? I'm not understanding the distinction, and I would think that shares (BTC?) would have a realized new cost absis as income?
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:51:21
As a US resident, bitcoin is treated as "property".  If you sell it at a higher price than what you acquired it for, the difference is taxable as capital gains. If you held the property less than one year, it is "short term capital gains" and it is taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you hold the property longer than a year, then it is "long term capital gains", whose tax rate is either 0, 15%, or 20% based on your income level. (0% if income is below $39,376, 15% if income is in next window up to $434,550, and 20% above that.) If you sell the property at a loss, then the difference can be deducted from your taxes, with the same short-term and long-term treatment.
Here is a bitcoin example, with some level of detail:
**On Jan 31, 2018** you bought 2.0 BTC at a price of $10,000 per BTC. (Yay you!)
**On February 17, 2018**, the BTC price has risen to $11,000, and you want to take advantage of your gains. You treat yourself to a new ultrawide monitor for your computer. (Sweet!) The monitor costs you exactly $1000 worth of BTC to transact (includes the miner transaction fee).  At the current BTC price, that is equivalent to 0.09090909 BTC.
Those 0.09090909 BTC originally cost you $909.09 to buy. This is known as your "cost basis". The difference between your selling of your BTC ($1,000) and its cost basis ($909.09) is $90.91. This is your capital gains on the transaction.
Since the BTC was held less than one year, your capital gains are "short term capital gains" and will be taxed at your regular income tax rate.
**On March 10, 2018**, the BTC price has quickly dropped to $9,500. You are concerned that your value is eroding, so you decide to cash out a bit more by getting a second ultrawide monitor for our computer. (Of course, you need a matching pair!) The total transaction cost is still $1,000 worth of BTC, which this time is 0.10526316 BTC.
Those 0.10526316 BTC originally cost you $1,052.63 to buy, which is your cost basis for this transaction. This time, you lost value with your monitor purchase, with the difference of $52.63 being recognized as a "short-term capital loss". 
When you net out the $90.91 gain and the $52.63 loss, you end up with a net gain of $38.28. And since they were both short-term transactions, the $38.28 capital gains income will be taxed at your regular icome tax rate.
If you have been doing the math, you now have 1.80382775 BTC.
**It is now July 1, 2019** and you realize that you need to move your BTC off the Exchange and into your hardware wallet that you never got around to initializing. After all, with the current price of $11,200 per BTC, your coins are worth $20,202.87, still more than what you originally spent. You set up your hardware wallet, and transfer all the coins, less the transaction fee of 0.00019643, which on the day of transfer was worth $2.20.
That transaction fee you paid to the miner for validating the transaction, and securing it into the next block was a fee paid for a service. That is no different than the money you paid for your monitor. It also generated a capital gains tax obligation.
The miner fee of 0.00019643 BTC originally cost you $1.96, so that is your cost basis of the $2.20 value. The difference of $0.24 is your capital gains that you will owe tax on. However, since the BTC was held longer than a year, it is a "long-term" capital gain, and it gets a more favorable rate as described in the first paragraph above.
I realize that most people ignore the capital gains and losses of their transaction fees. But it is technically owed, and it is the only way to reconcile the actual holding amounts.

**Part 2**
Let's see the tax implications of both scenarios. For these calculations, let's assume that for short term capital gains you fall in the 24% tax bracket, and for long term capital gains you fall in the 15% tax bracket.
**Scenario 1a**: You sell from your Coinbase account. Using FIFO, the whole first UTXO from 01/02/2016 is sold. The proceeds are 1.14942529 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $20,689.66.   
The cost basis is 1.14942529 BTC \* 435 $/BTC = $500.  
The long term capital gain is $20,689.66 - $500.00 = $20,189.66.  
At a 15% long term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $20,189.66 \* 15% = **$3,028.45**
For the remaining BTC to sell to get to your target sale, you need to sell an additional 1.38888889 - 1.14942529 = 0.23946360 BTC from the 01/23/2017 UTXO. This will result in a short term capital gain.
The proceeds are 0.23946360 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $4,310.34.  
The cost basis is 0.23946360 BTC \* 925 $/BTC = $221.50  
The short term capital gain is $4,310.34 - $221.50 = $4,088.84.  
At a 24% short term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $4,088.84 \* 24% = **$981.32**
Total tax owed under Scenario 1a is $3,028.45 + $901.32 = **$4,008.77**
**Scenario 1b**: You sell from your smartphone digital wallet account. Using FIFO, the whole first UTXO from 09/29/2016 is sold. 
The proceeds are 0.7513148 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $13,523.67.   
The cost basis is 0.7513148 BTC \* 665.50 $/BTC = $500.  
The long term capital gain is $13,523.67 - $500.00 = $13,023.67.  
At a 15% long term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $13,023.67 \* 24% = **$1,953.55**
For the remaining BTC to sell to get to your target sale, you need to sell an additional 1.38888889 - 0.7513148 = 0.63757409 BTC from the 11/23/2017 UTXO. This will also result in a long term capital gain.
The proceeds are 0.63757409 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $11,476.33.  
The cost basis is 0.63757409 BTC \* 809.60 $/BTC = $516.18  
The long term capital gain is $11,476.33 - $516.18 = $10,960.15.  
At a 15% long term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $10,960.15 \* 15% = **$1,644.02**
Total tax owed under Scenario 1b is $1,953.55 + $1,644.02 = **$3,597.57**
**Scenario 2**: You sell from your hardware wallet. Using a merged FIFO, the whole first UTXO from 01/02/2016 is sold. 
The proceeds are 1.14845687 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $20,672.22.   
The cost basis is 1.14845687 BTC \* 435 $/BTC = $499.58.  
The long term capital gain is $20,672.22 - $499.58 = $20,172.64.  
At a 15% long term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $20,172.64 \* 15% = **$3,025.90**
For the remaining BTC to sell to get to your target sale, you need to sell an additional 1.38888889 - 1.14845687 = 0.24043202 BTC from the 09/29/2016 UTXO. This will also result in a long term capital gain.
The proceeds are 0.24043202 BTC \* 18,000 $/BTC = $4,327.78.  
The cost basis is 0.24043202 BTC \* 925 $/BTC = $222.40  
The long term capital gain is $4,327.78 - $222.40 = $4,105.38.  
At a 15% long term capital gain tax rate, you will owe $4,105.38 \* 15% = **$615.81**
Total tax owed under Scenario 1a is $3,025.90 + $615.81 = **$3,641.70**
So it looks like Scenario 1b was the lowest tax consequence. Had you kept the Coinbase and smartphone digital wallets separate, you could select the highest cost basis and longest term BTC for selling, while still maintaining  the FIFO accounting process.
By merging everything into the same hardware wallet account, the flexibility was lost. However, the flexibility could be maintained by putting the Coinbase BTC into one hardware wallet account, and the smartphone digital wallet BTC into another separate hardware wallet account. (With a Trezor, you can do this with separate passphrases for separate accounts. My understanding is that a Ledger or a KeepKey wallet would require separate hardware wallets for multiple accounts. Someone please correct me if I am wrong on that detail.)
Bottom line is that you should try to maintain maximum flexibility of which coins to sell by maintaining multiple entity accounts. This allows you to select whichever FIFO set has the best tax advantage.
Whew! Had I known in advance this example was going to be this long, I would not have written it.

For the life of me, I can not comprehend how Lightning Network can possibly work (practically) without major relays emerging which will be one the new pseudo-centralized banking system.
Unless a new consensus mechanism is deployed along the lines of DAG or BLS, the fees will rendering Bitcoin as only a store of value. I'm ok with that, but will need to use another crypto for payments.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:00:49
If I wanted to send you money, we'd have to open a direct channel, or we'd have to have one in common elsewhere, such as Amazon or PayPal.  So basically to avoid all these high fees, I need to park a lot of my BTC somewhere that has the highest chance of connectedness. Sounds like a bank to me.  How is this better??
I really want LN to work, but I have not seen compelling evidence that it will scale. (Yes, I read the documentation extensively.)

When are the transaction fees going to crash back?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:27:42
Opening channels between two people requires fees to be paid on-chain. If I want to send you money in a one-off transaction, we are better off finding a common middle-man to leverage existing channels. That will result in a much smaller fee for the transaction, since we already paid our bigger fees to park the money into an equivalent of a stored-value account. A crypto version of PayPal will emerge.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:17:05
Exceptionally well written and explained. Thank you. I agree that the lending/credit aspect is the differentiating factor. However, LN is actually reinventing PayPal, as it is significantly disintegrates the single middle-man role. In the end, for the average user, the LN will look like a new PayPal that they do not understand how it works. But it will have all of the security and trustlessness that Bitcoin promises.

Absolutely not a troll. Been around and serious for a long time.
The $100k is a starting point, and the multiplier is a reflection of relative usability by the masses. I have no idea which altcoin will be viewed as a reasonable alternative and competitive currency. But I do believe that TPS will be an important attribute, and the ratio of BTC-TPS / ALT-TPS is a reasonable multiplier on that $100k. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:04:53
I believe it will stabilize at $100k multiplied by a factor. That factor is the ratio of BTC transactions per second divided by whatever top competitive altcoin TPS is (assuming reasonably equivalent transaction fees).

Thanks. That is helpful.  As an augmentation to my questioning, it was triggered by the recent array of products where your public address is burned into dogtags, metal cards, even tattoos.  Such a hard-coding of the public address prevents the multiple address approach to protect transaction privacy.  I'd have to clear it out to hide the balance as you suggest, but even that address can be explored in the blockchain.
When a service like Coinbase provides me with an address to use to receive funds, I'm wondering if they regularly clear it out to new address in my account as part of their cold storage.  I'll have to explore that with them.

There is one part of the story that is very wrong (as best as I can understand the tax implications). It said that since the payroll withholds taxes, the Bitcoin are tax-free.  I don't think that is true. Whatever exchange rate you receive the BTC with, that sets its cost basis. If the value of BTC increases when you use it, the gains are taxed.
It is no different than me buying BTC on an exchange or CoinBase -- I am buying the BTC with after-tax dollars, and their gains will be taxable later.
This (very nice) new feature just makes it easy for employees to invest money in BTC.

I'm not very knowledgeable about how QR codes actually work.  It seems that many codes can resolve to the same information.  For example, I went to bitaddress.org and created a random address, and it generates a QR code.  I then copied that address and entered it at mybtc,io, and it generated three very different codes.
So, how does one check to see that the address resolves to the correct information?  I'd hate to create a code that sends BTC to someone else.

Putting funds into a paper wallet is fine to accumulate BTC.  However, if you ever spend money from that wallet, there is a theoretical security risk.  The address is a hash of the actual Public Key which is disclosed for the first time on the blockchain when a transaction is verified.  The concern is that at some time in the future, it may be possible to brute-force a cracking of your actual Private Key from the Public Key.
To prevent that, just always use a new address each time.

The security risk I am referring to is not about theft of the private key, but rather is a theoretical one, and is a concern for when computing power is more capable.  Here is my understanding:
The wallet address that we use is actually a hash of the public key.  This public key is not known in the network until you sign with your private key.   It is not currently known how to decipher the public key to figure out what the private key is.  However, some people have raised a concern that this may get figured out over time.  so the simple thing to do is not re-use any addresses when funds are transferred elsewhere.
Now, whether this risk of deciphering the private key should be a concern is the real question.  If the concern is silly, then having engraved addresses on metal is fine for daily use to receive funds.  However if the concern is real, then the engraved addresses on metal should only be used for deep cold storage for fire protection, etc.
Thanks for your very thorough description.  It has sent my mind on another line of questions about how to truly mask the salary example.  Since the blockchain has all the transactions, the salary can be figured out through backward tracing.  Hmmm.

I don't know the actual risk, although I do believe it has to do with better computational power.
Regarding the components of the cryptography: There are three components.
1) The Private Key (no one ever sees this)
2) The Public Key (it is derived from the private key, and no one ever sees this until you spend money)
3) The Public Address (it is derived from the Public Key, and everyone sees this and uses it to send you money)
There is no cryptographic risk with your public address being visible and used for multiple transactions of receiving BTC, until you spend some -- and then the Public Key is in the blockchain, and the theoretical risk is there.
However, there is another reason for using new addresses all the time: because all transactions are visible on the blockchain, it becomes easier to identify you by studying the blockchain.

I am not at all advocating for the site in original post. I am saying that a truly random passphrase with sufficient entropy is perfectly secure.  I have a truly random passphrase with over 200 bits of entropy that I memorized.  I used an offline computer to generate my address.  I then encrypted it with another (different) random passphrase also with over 200 bits of entropy (also memorized).  The two passphrases are not written down anywhere.
Sure, my method is vulnerable to my memory  and well-being.  But my BTC are exceptionally secure.  They are only susceptible to address collisions.

If you generate your own addresses from a computer that is not connected to the internet, then I do not see how your IP address can ever be associated with them.  However, if you transmit them online line unencrypted, then I think it may be possible for Google to know. (Or CoinBase or other web wallet provider.)

I couldn't agree more on the reality that growth is happening.  But we are soooo much at the beginning of things.  I know it's been said before, but we are the "supremely early" adopters (the pioneers with some scarring on our backs).  There are still tens of millions of early adopters still to be minted that haven't had the "aha moment" of learning.  Not to be cliche, but we have the obligation (as true believers) to educate and introduce.  That is why I give away paper wallets.  The paper wallets are from bitcoinpaperwallet.com and they are sealed with a zero balance.  I then say that instead of buying them a latte at Starbucks, will will send them $5 worth of milli-bits from my Mycelium app.  The real-time demo is like magic.  I give them the paperwallet and they are now in the franchise.  It works like a charm.  Of course I also point them to learning sources online.

Metcalfe's law is not really what is going on. Reed's law is the much more appropriate way to think about the value of the social network. 
Sarnoff's law says that the value of a network is proportional to the number of nodes n.  That is the broadcast model of television.  Metcalfe's law says that the value of a network is proportional to n^2 where the number of interconnections define the value.  That is the computer network effect.  David Reed's law says that the value of a network is proportional to 2^n.  This describes a social network where the value of the network is more important to me when the human social value increases for all nodes, not just my node, the more people there are.  This is what creates the super-exponential growth.

I've had lots of discussion with folk on bitcointalk and have been beaten down and now accept the fact these kinds of obfuscation schemes are not secure.
Your example of a 9-digit number which is then hashed that many times has only 29 bits of entropy with a bit of obfuscation. (And that is if the numbers are truly random. If you are using a derivation of some other number in your life, then you significantly reduce the entropy.) Granted, it may slow down a hacker to figure out the obfuscation, but there are a lot of smart people who will figure out your approach.
If you are going to use a brainwallet, you really need to have a truly random passphrase with at least 160 bits of entropy. I personally use a deterministic series of brainwallets based on a passphrase that has well over 200 bits of entropy. I realize that this is significant overkill, but I feel my few paltry BTC are very secure.
Memorizing such a long passphrase is well within the reach of everyone. It just takes some practice, and there are lots of memory training techniques and tools on the web.

Outstanding work!
A possible bug (or unexpected behavior): When I turn on BIP38, it correctly turns the paper to the blue indicator, and the text next to the Private Key QR Code indicates that it is "BIP38 Encrypted".  Then, when I uncheck the BIP38 box, the color correctly reverts back to green, but the "BIP38 Encrypted" label does not revert back to the WIF Format label as expected.
A couple requests:
1) For the back side instructions, it would be nice if the instructions were aware of whether BIP38 was enabled in the  session -- it would be nice to include something about BIP38 and the need for a passphrase to unlock the Private Key.
2) I would love to be able to enter some text in the Notes section that gets printed with the paperwallet. (Specifically, I want to have a professionally looking passphrase "clue" included in the printing.
Anyway, again, outstanding work!

Nice!  What material is it on?
I have a question about re-using addresses for deposit.  There are quite a few nice executions on nice materials (laser engraving, wood burning, 3d printing, etc.).  But I thought that once an address is used that you should not use it any more.  I recall that there are two reasons: 1) once the address is used, other people can know your balances; and 2) the security risk of your public key being in the block chain if you move money to another address.
So is it worth it to have nicely made (expensive) deposit addresses?

The price would steadily rise while they were buying.  The less people there were not willing to sell, the higher the price would get.  When the buyer stops buying, the price would fall to a new equilibrium level based on the new perceived value of the remaining buyers and sellers.

Agreed, but there is something completely different going on with bitcoin.  The addresses and private keys will exist forever.  Whoever knows the private keys will have access to the bitcoin.  The only thing that will stall bitcoin is if the blockchain is given up on by all miners.  But I seriously doubt that will happen since the value may return, and the speculative ones amongst the miners will keep it going.
The only thing the government can do is to prohibit its use through laws.  But as we saw during the prohibition and alcohol, ridiculous laws just don't work.

Very nice design.  I really like the design.  But why would anyone trust that the private keys are secure.  You or someone in the manufacturing process in theory can be monitoring the address for when there is a meaningful level of BTC, and then transfer them.  I'm in no way accusing that you would do that, but the possibility will cause enough uncertainty that someone will not want to buy them.  Perhaps a BIP38 approach for custom printed cards?
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:37:57
While I agree with others that BIP38 is the way to go, your approach is reasonable.  However the vulnerability in your approach is the loss of the paper wallet with the private key that you need with your passphrase.

Are you talking about an auto-replenishing wallet/account?  Basically it replaces what you spend?  I was hoping that CoinBase would institute that in such a way that it applied to a sub-wallet in my account.  In other words, I would like a partition for spending that held 0.5 BTC.  It would manage all the addresses and change addresses, and just keep my spending balance whole.  It would replenish after some appropriate threshold was reached.  But from my main account, the auto-replenish would not apply -- I would manage that based on the current BTC price as well as managing the overall holdings.

How would you categorize Trezor when used with a secret passphrase?  That feels like Level 1 to me.
I have two Trezors. Anyone can take my main one and they will never have access to my BTC. I keep my backup as a clone of the first. (And if that is lost, I keep my 24 word seed encrypted in a private cloud. And that requires my passphrase to reconstruct in Wallet32.)
My secret passphrase is a long random sequence of words, and the PIN for the Trezor is also a long random sequence of numbers.
I feel pretty secure.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:24:02
Sorry for the delay... long work day.
Let me try to rephrase the question.
My understanding is that an address is safe to re-use to collect funds from multiple sources (like a tip account, etc.) But, when you move funds out of that address, you open up the (potential) security vulnerability.  That is why I question the practicality of an engraved address (or a tattooed one!), unless it was only going to be used for long term cold storage.
A related question involves the addresses that CoinBase assigns you to your account.  When they provide me with an address to use for people to send money to, I know that CoinBase will move funds around for their cold storage... and this gets logged into the blockchain.  And this opens up that potential security vulnerability.
I guess I am still trying to get my sea legs under me with respect to managing all the addresses that are part of my constellation.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:59:44
I like the idea of an email notification on any changes.
Another thought would be for a way to send a message to the account owner of an alias.  For example, if I wanted to send a message to the person that has the alias "bitcoin", I do not know how to get a hold of him/her.  There are a couple of reasons I can think of to want to do this. First, I may want to confirm with them that the bitcoin address listed there is still the valid one (especially if there is to be a large money transfer).  Second, I may want to buy that alias from them.  (That leads to another capability that would be nice -- to be able to transfer an alias from one user account to another.  It should be some sort of system request form one account, and then the second account that owns the alias would get notified, and they can accept the transfer.)
I've spent a few minutes looking over your site's functionality.  Very nice work!

My thought about not solving the next block early was why there needs to be a random nonce added to the prior block header (as defined by the bitcoin software) and that coupled with a random portion of the puzzle would provide a fresh starting point.  However, the more I've thought about it, pools of miners could pre-compute combinations of possible puzzles and pounce on the new puzzle.
i guess that would force the difficulty to converge on the point where there was enough hashing power to pre-compute everything in the available 10 minute period.
That coupled with the unreliability of a true timestamp has been a fun thinking exercise which, for me, highlights the elegance of what Satoshi Nakamoto designed.

I think There are a few issues here. 
First, companies who offer gift cards for their stores are covering some of the cost of the card as marketing expense to get you into the store and build a positive experience so that you keep coming back. So they have an incentive to subsidize the gift card transaction. This is why you see some restaurant cards at Costco selling for a discount.
Second, the economics of gift cards rely on breakage. That it people giving the company cash for the gift card, and then never using the gift card. This can be forgetting where you put it or in some cases the card expiring.
In the case of Bitcoin, neither of these situations is exist. A merchant doesn't control where the BTC are spent, so they may not get the business. So they have no incentive to spend marketing dollars on that kind of exchange. Also, the merchant does not get the proceeds of the BTC value (unless they themselves sold you the BTC, but then they face serious volatility risk, still without controlling how the recipient spend the currency).
If you are thinking that a merchant can restrict the use of the BTC to just their stores, then that no longer is a bitcoin system, and it would not have any attractiveness to participate in.
Granted, the recipient could still lose their private key and create breakage. But since the BTC are not tied to a specific use, people will be less likely to lose them (compared to a gift card that requires you to spend at "Olive Garden" restaurant.
I think the simplest way to do this is to give a gift of a paper wallet, or better yet, send your friend some BTC to their smartphone wallet.

No one owns any bitcoins.  We just happen to know the private keys.  Whoever transacts with those private keys extracts the value (and incurs the tax liability).
This is why it is so important to not use brainwallets if you can't have a truley random passphrase with more than 160 bits of entropy.  Otherwise someone else may know the implied private key, and they can extract the value.

I agree on point 1. What I meant to say was to set the difficulty so that it takes the entire network to find the solution in approximately 1 minute.  (Similar to how the current difficulty is set to having the network find the solution in 10 minutes.)

The puzzle is to take the prior block (header?) plus a random nonce that the software generates as the input to the hash, and a specified hash output leading digits as I mentioned before (smaller number of leading zeros, followed by a random string as set by the software).

There was a moment of whining that the government needs to be equally disruptive to Bitcoin as it is with other companies such as PayPal.  That underlying whining seems to be fueling all the rest of his logic.
Government regulators are smart enough to know the peril of letting the USA become laggards in this important technology.  Some evidence of that with FINCEN's recent rulings.

Proposal on Proof of Work:
I'm not entirely sure I understand the concerns about PoW, but I think it has to do with the amount of energy consumed in the process. So with that in mind, here is my thought in a 2-step approach:
1) Reduce the puzzle complexity so that it can be solved in 1 minute (instead of 10 minutes).
2) Enforce that the next block can not be started until the 10-minute mark.
This essentially eliminates 90% of the energy used for the blockchain processing.
The solution for this is to have the puzzle be X leading zeros, followed by a random short string that is set by the system at the 10-minute mark.  For example, the leading digits for the puzzle might be 0000A9BD, where the "A9BD" portion is set at the 10-minute mark.
So basically, all the computing energy is consumed for 1 minute.  Some of the rest of the time is used to verify who was really the first miner to solve the problem.  then the rest of the time can be used to accumulate the remaining unconfirmed transaction pool and prepare for the next puzzle when it is announced by the system.  This way, the network can have the blocks started exactly every 10 minutes.
I don't have a suggestion for how to control the determination and propagation of the random portion to the miners, but I think others can solve that.
Can you tell me whether this idea holds any merit?

A great resource is bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Download the html file from github (link on the bitcoinpaperwallet.com site) and run it offline.  You can generate brainwallets and even encrypt the private keys with BIP38.  Really great resource.
If used correctly, brianwallets are secure. They are hard to use correctly and are prone to disastrous errors (non random passphrases, or forgetting good ones).  I know all this, and still use brainwallets.  I use random passphrases with entropy on overkill, and my coins have been safe for a very long time.

I believe that governments (with guns and laws) can harm fungibility by blacklisting any offspring coins from "suspect" activities.

That reminds me of my own bank rant.  A couple years ago, I had set up a free service that my bank offered so that I could easily transfer funds to my son's account.  That was fine, and it worked ok.  Several months later I noticed that the bank started charging me $5 per month for this service.  I was irate and called them asking why they were charging me for the "free" service.  They told me that the service was free, but there was a $5 charge for each month that I did NOT use the service.  WTF?! I asked how there could possibly be a cost to them for me not using a free service.  No answer other than "that is our policy."  So even though I had been a customer at that bank for over 25 years, I liquidated my account and went elsewhere.

I use my credit card about the same as you - around 2500 purchases per year.  In the last 10 years they caught 2 fraudulent charges.  One was someone trying to buy a laptop in a different state, and another one was someone trying to buy a motorcycle.  So the system works.  However, they have it set so sensitively that there are way too many false positives.  And that really sucks.
When they THINK there was a problem, they automatically shut down the card, and issue me a new number.  I then have to update around 30 online merchants that I have set up for auto payment.  That is a royal pain in the ass, and this happens every six months or so.
The one incident that flipped me out completely was they refused to accept my wife's use of the card for a taxi in Manhattan when she was travelling on her own.  She did not have any cash with her, but fortunately she found an alternate credit card buried in her wallet to use.  I was irate and was very demanding of the credit card customer service people.  They said that an out-of-state use of the card will automatically trigger a fraud event when they have no record of you being out of state. I asked them if they noticed that my wife's airfare, hotel and other meals were also used with the card on that same trip.  They got very quiet. Then apologized.
I got a call from the credit card company the next day telling me that they will never identify our transactions as fraud, and that they have put a special flag on our account.
They claim to be protecting us, but they are really just protecting their own interests, and think nothing of inconveniencing us.
Stop calling people clueless; everyone has their own experiences. Be nice.

My problem with credit cards is the amount of fees the merchant is required to pay (as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transaction) which is passed on to the consumer in the price of the product or service.
Yes, I know the credit card companies provide fraud protection and all that. But they also have userous interest rates which prey on society and lock them into debt.
Bitcoin addresses the fraud. The miner fees are based on a byte count, and not on transaction value. We just need a scaling solution that will work. I'm just impatient, and sad. Song and Maxwell's comments felt defeatist.

When Segwit deploys, transaction payloads will be smaller due to the stripping out of the signatures. Smaller transactions means that you can fit more of them in the same sized block.  If the total number of trransactions does not grow, then the blocks will not be as full, hence lower fees.
This reminds me of the time when my city's main road was too congested due to too much traffic. The city planners decided to time the lights better, and they got rid of the bicycle lanes (which no one used in that part of the city). For a while, the traffic flowed better. But then more people started using that road and the traffic  sucks again.
Segwit will be providing us fee relief until the block is full again.

I have done a fair bit of research, and have not found compelling arguments that alleviate my concerns.

The reason I think it has to have some name like "Bitcoin ___" is the fact that it is the only sustaining (for now) fork which shares 9 years of common blockchain transactions. Had they forked the code with a new Genesis block to address the block size limit issue, then it should have had a completely different name. (Even though it is trying to be true to the original white paper.)

Thank you, that is helpful. So basically, I have to pay a regular  Bitcoin transaction fee for everything I spend. But since I can lock up larger amounts in my channel, I won't be paying the higher BTC fees on every transaction. The expectation is that in the aggregate, fees will be lower. I believe the general concern should be that the vast majority of people live from paycheck to paycheck, and will not be able to afford locking up much money in any channels. I don't see how LN will help the masses.

I suppose the exception is that a non-UTXO transaction with just an OP_RETURN code also just checks the signature.
But for regular UTXO transactions like you mention, the node only checks that the UTXO exists, and not fully trace back through the blockchain to prove it's original coinbase validity? (I assume the miners do that.)

All good advice, and I have done the right thing on all fronts. My main hesitation with hardware wallets has been the firmware upgrades and shifting access portals.

The problem with this approach is that no matter how well you obfuscate your technique, it makes the technique hard to remember, to the point that you have to write it down. Not sure I agree with your 'leveraging entropy' implication, since the real amount of entropy is very, very low coupled with high obfuscation.
I'm not saying that anyone will figure it out, but approaches like diceware are much easier to remember how to use and much easier to retain.

Actual article behind wall:
First it was tulips. More recently it was tech stocks and then the housing market. Lately, it’s all about bitcoin.
All four share a common denominator: They suffered through financial bubbles, or bubble-like conditions. The first three ended badly. The jury is still out on what’s in store for bitcoin.
Yet the more the digital currency surges, the louder the debate grows around financial bubbles, which appear to be getting bigger and riskier than ever before.
Bubbles are investment manias, where prices jump so high that no fundamental analysis can rightly justify the surge. The price gains, usually sharp and quick, are typically followed by busts that tend to be just as severe.
The first known financial bubble is thought to have taken place in the 17th century, when Dutch tulip prices had a spectacular rise and fall. Recently, investment manias include the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and the housing boom and bust in the 2000s, which paved the way for the 2008 global financial crisis.
Now, the debate centers on bitcoin. The digital currency topped $7,000 this month for the first time, a gain of more than 600% so far this year. Three years ago, bitcoin was at $300. Six years ago, it was at $2.
In the past 15 months, bitcoin has surged almost eight times as much as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Co mposite did in the final 15 months of the dot-com bubble. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently warned investors that financial bubbles are getting “more bubbly” than ever before.
Opinions vary on bitcoin’s sharp price moves. Bitcoin is the “very definition of a bubble,” Credit Suisse Group AG Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said at a conference earlier this month. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a “fraud” that will “blow up.” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein told CNBC that “maybe bitcoin is kind of a bubble.”

Evidence is mounting that the finance industry is warming to bitcoin. Goldman said last month it was considering setting up a trading operation for digital currencies. And exchange operator CME Group Inc. announced plans to begin offering a bitcoin futures contract. That would give Wall Street traders an avenue to bet on bitcoin prices and hedge against volatility, a crucial step in bitcoin’s move into institutional and retail markets.
Still, if past bubbles are any indication, bitcoin’s spectacular rise won’t last forever. And when it ends, look out below.

Sarnoff's Law (David Sarnoff): value of network is proportional to the number of nodes.
Metcalfe's Law (Robert Metcalfe): value of network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes.
Reed's Law (David Reed): value of network is proportional to 2 raised to the number of nodes.
Reed's Law implies that as the value of the network grows for each participant as there are more participants, there is a community value effect. This drives the exponential value.  Bitcoin's value is network AND use.
OP's conclusions are right in my opinion.

I like the bottles water analogy. My understanding is that LN fees would always exist, and in your analogy, the LN nodes would take a very tiny sip (a drop) from the bottle.
But what I'm asking about is the recent discussion of new LN tokens, which would be like new currency to transport the bottles. My first question was why not use BT. For that, but I guess there is not enough room on the blockchain for those fee transactions?

Total noob here relative to what hackers are capable of.  Regarding the keylogger capabbilities... couldn't a hack get on the USB drive as a keylogger so that the next transaction also loads a hidden file on the USB drive... so when the transaction is sent on the connected machine, the secret file with the private key is also sent?  Is that even possible?  (And how do you protect for it?)
I personally use TREZOR (even though I must admit that I do not understand all of the potential attack vectors and how it protects for that.)  I am hopeful that the TREZOR will one day allow for a scrambled passphrase input (like they do for the PIN).

I'm not at all suggesting that our current processes are even remotely close to what they should be. What I'm saying is that we *could* design a practical solution eventually and have it integrated in a vehicle if a customer prefers it.
Today I use a Starbucks app that I have to do convoluted things to keep my available funds topped off, and keeping my user id and password secure.  With more and more Starbucks opening drive-thrus, I can imagine that they will eventually provide me with some wireless contraption to stick to my windshield to make their operations more efficient.  
Also to use the northeast states' (USA) automatic toll road system, (EZPass) I have to set up a convoluted replenshment account so that I can access the faster lanes, and keep my hardware device topped off with money.
In just these two (widely used) examples, the solutions are tolerable, and within broader ecosystem payment channels, but they are unique to each merchant. I'm only suggesting that Bitcoin provides us with the potential for a better and more ubiquitous solution for vehicle integration.
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:34:11
No offense taken from your comments, but you're making some assumptions about people's abilities to safeguard their funds.
I use three solutions for storage. For long term storage and for the majority of my funds, I use BIP38 encrypted paper wallets. (One set in fireproof and waterproof lock box, and one duplicate set in a bank safety deposit box.) For intermediate storage of a nominal amount of funds I use the three Trezors as described earlier. For my short term spending I use a Mycelium wallet.
For my Trezors, I have a very secure and rigorous process for safeguarding the passphrase and pin, and I would rather not have to keep up with multiple hadware solutions and passphrases.
The very nature of this discussion is one of the challenges of widespread adoption of bitcoin. It is hard to own without stress.

I don't really think LN will be understood or accepted broadly. From a consumer's perspective, it is no different than a Starbucks stored value account or an Amazon gift card. You have to pony up money first (and pay a hefty and growing fee) before you can spend anything. I think people will want to use Bitcoin like cash, but will be put off by the fees. After all, credit cards don't charge fees (sic).

Here is a sobering (and insane) proposal from Senator Ron Wyden: tax unrealized gains as regular income annually. Essentially it is a "mark to market" annual taxation of your wealth. Trying to stay legal with crypto would be impossible.
From today's Wall Street Journal:
WASHINGTON—The top Democrat on the Senate’s tax-writing committee proposed taxing unrealized gains in investment assets every year at the same rates as other income, offering an idea that would transform how the U.S. taxes the wealthiest people.
The proposal from Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon is the latest plan from Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates for boosting taxes on the wealthy to address [economic inequality]( and provide funding for their policy agenda. While this specific proposal has little chance of becoming law soon, such ideas could quickly gain momentum if the party succeeds in next year’s elections.
Under Mr. Wyden’s concept, capital gains would be taxed annually based on how much assets have gained in value. Now, by contrast, gains are taxed only when assets are sold and at a top rate of 23.8% instead of 37% for ordinary income.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:37:02
No, it is not. 1 Meg is 1 Meg. The transactions are smaller, so the main chain can hold more of them. But the blocksize is still 1,024 bytes. Granted, the witness database requires extra space.

@_date: 2016-02-14 14:43:59
I have three Trezors, all set up with the same seed, passphrase, and pin. One is nearby for use as needed, and the other two in safe storage in different places.
The only thing I was concerned about with Trezor was the potential of phishing when sending money to the Trezor (a false receiving address faked on the chrome browser). But they remedied that in January 2015 with an update with the "show on trezor" feature.
Now the Trezor meets all my needs and is a real bargain.

The biggest problem with this paper is that it concludes that brainwallets are not used much and are falling from favor. But they base this only on the brainwallets they were able to find, and they should not be surprised that these easy addresses were drained.  Strong passphrases were not found (because they are too hard to find), and they have no idea how many there are. 
Brainwallets are not for the uninitiated, but they are perfectly fine with sufficient bits of entropy. If you don't know what that means, stay far away. If you do know what that means, and you are diligent, you will be in good shape. (But you should probably still stay far away anyway.)

One anal-retentive aspect of crypto-asset tax handling in the U.S. is that if you move coins from one wallet to another, the miner's fee will actually generate capital gain/loss. Yes, it is small, and most people ignore it. However, it is spending to the miners for their validation services. It's the only way to truly reconcile every last Satoshi if there ever was an audit.

Actually, credentials matter an incredible amount. Bitcoin requires an incredible understanding of many topics: programming, distributed networks, cryptography, economics, game theory, human psychology, and probably a few other areas that don't come to mind quickly. 
Very few people in this space are experts in all aspects. From what I have seen, programming and cryptography are the dominant areas of focus and earned reputation.
Having said that, real expertise in these areas earns you nothing, unless you can demonstrate through contributions to the community.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:04:54
probably the correct way to use this analogy is that there is a bin with a ridiculously large number of keys that you can pick from (and they correspond to an equal number of lockers). the key tells you which locker it belongs to. there is only one key per locker. however, anyone can try to cut a new key for a locker with money in it, but it is unfeasible for them to ever guess the right lock configuration.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:01:02
No, you would have 250 BTC (and 250 BCH, lol). If you wanted the exchange to cash out for you, they would sell it in the open market on your behalf. And they would take a commission as well, so they don't care.
If you did it right, you'd have taken custody of those coins immediately into a paper wallet or a hardware wallet. (But I don't know if hardware wallets even existed back then.)

I've watched that video before, and while it is very good, it does not build on the analogy in a helpful way; it is more interested in making the point about big numbers.
Let me try it this way:  The public addresses correspond to the general ledger, and as such are equivalent to the locker numbers.  You do need a private key to unlock the locker.  But knowing the locker address in no way lets you know how to cut the key to work. In other words, if you know just the address you can not know what the private key is to unlock it. You can try to guess, but that is an unfeasible endeavor.
The analogy of seeing into the locker (and knowing its address) is a good one, because anyone can peruse the blockchain ledger.  If you know an address, you can check to see what is there. And if you want to cut a random private key, you can derive the public address and check to see if there is any bitcoin assigned to that address.  But there are so many addresses that it is unfeasible to ever guess a private key with unspent outputs assigned to its corresponding address.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:59:58
not sure this is right either
the blockchain is open and you can see all the addresses with unspent outputs
the lockers do have locks that require a key

I thought the article started on very solid footing. I wished the halving was mentioned with a mention of the "programmed monetary policy" of Bitcoin resembling precious metals, and uneditable by politicians. But then all the focus on criminal activity missed the point of educating the reader of what is possible, and why the tech and financial community is so interested in it.
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:32:35
I just finished reading the report. Good read. However, their assessment of digital currencies being a low risk is basically due to its current low usage levels, and its complexity of use. I was expecting to see some reference to the pseudonymous nature and its better trace-ability (as was recently reported on CNBC), but they basically say that  it may get riskier as more people learn to use it, and that authorities need more centralized control across the board.
@_date: 2015-03-02 13:41:15
The_Bitcoin_Delusion, your posts are well written, and I'm going to look up your other posts to read them too.  I appreciate the clarity of thought.
My question might sound antagonistic if it were just naked on its own, so let me preface it by saying that I am genuinely interested in your comments.  What aspects of bitcoin (the currency and the protocol) do you like and think can make it successful in the long term?
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:33:39
This concept was floating around this subreddit many months ago, and my idea then was to send the money to charity, but have the amount *double* on each subsequent "snooze button" hit until you get up and turn off the alarm.

@_date: 2015-03-02 14:35:06
Thanks for the response.  I've only been involved in bitcoin since the fall of 2013, and I share your concerns.  However, I believe that the built-in monetary policy of a fixed and transparent monetary supply, and coupled with the open blockchain -- are the true valuable components for the long term.  I believe that the technical challenges of blocksize, true privacy, etc. will be solved over time.  I believe new service providers that add real value (insurance, risk reduction, exchanges, escrow, etc.) will deservedly earn their fees, and those fees will be significantly lower than the current system. 
Every system in human history has seen its corruption, greed, swindlers and victims.  But I believe that the true believers and innovators of bitcoin will evolve this system to give us control of our money.  And then we will denominate things in bitcoin because we will not need the alternatives.
Sadly, as I am in the later stages of life, I may not see the full potential come to fruition, as there is a lot to be worked out.  But I am hopeful.
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:08:19
Interesting idea.  Are they using a real wallet where the complete control is with the user?  In other words, there is no central re-routing of payments?  I would think then that the app just provides convenient address management for users to send each other money.  I'm interested in understanding how they will prevent hacking.

The usability of Trezor is quite excellent.  It has to use the mytrezor.com site with a browser plugin, but that is very easy to set up.  They also just announced a new beta version (beta.mytrezor.com) which allows for account and transaction labeling. It is integrated with dropbox, adn all labelling info is encrypted with a hardware key (from your Trezor device) before it is stored on the Dropbox folder.
The Trezor has been rock solid, and I'm slowly migrating more of my coin to it from paper wallets.
As others have mentioned, the metal version is no longer produced, but might be available some day on ebay (for a lot of money, I'm sure).
One other thing of note is that you can initialize a spare trezor with your seed words, passphrase and pin, so that you have a duplicate backup at all times in case of loss or your main unit.  Just keep it in a safe place, and you are prepared.

For two or so years, paper wallets in safe deposit banks is perfectly fine and secure.
But a much more interesting question is how to secure your BTC for a very long time. This is a much more challenging engineering question than you'd think.

There is a big difference between the probability of winning and the expected value of winning.  I can design a scheme where 80% of the people win something small.  But in the end people will measure their expected winnings to the cost of participating.  All the BTC in must equal all the BTC out, so such a scheme generates a lower expected value, and this will cause people to not want to participate.

Very curious to know what class this is for.
I would say that governments should treat it as they do with any foreign currency. Can be used short term as cash, but has long term investment taxation treatment. Challenge will be in knowing/proving the difference, as you can keep moving the BTC to new addresses to maintain the appearance of short term holding.

I have Trezor and a KeepKey, and am waiting on a Case delivery (does anyone know anything about the expected shipping date?).  I really like both the Trezor and KeepKey, but I think Case will be the easiest to use due to its built in connectivity.  But the one thing I am a bit leery about is Case having one of the multi-sig keys.
And before anyone jumps on me for having too many hardware wallets without fully understanding them, I want to collect the early artifacts of our industry!

It is a private key that is encrypted with a passphrase. When you try to spend with that private key, the wallet will ask for the passphrase to decrypt the encrypted private key so that it can sign the transaction.  Essentially it is another layer of protection. Sites like bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com allow for its creation and use.

In Bitcoin, you can't tell which was the intended payment and which was the change. The outputs' order is randomized. This security aspect of transaction design is a critical part of the system, so I would count both components as money flow.

This is another one of those things where you really have to know what you are doing, and then it is safe. I can rebut every one of those concerns through knowledge and care. Paper wallets work just fine for me.
If after studying everything, and you are concerned about paper wallets, then by all means use a Trezor or a Ledger. (But then keep your passphrase very secure.)
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:38:09
That is why I use my own generated (diceware) truly random and high entropy seed which I feed into the brainwallet panel, and with BIP38 encryption enabled with another strong passphrase. I am not relying on the javascript for any randomness.

I am anxiously waiting for a clean integration between Trezor and Mycelium.  I use both now and send/receive between the two from myTrezor.com.  The way I hope it works is to just plug my Trezor into my Android while Mycelium is running, and have the two interoperate seamlessly.  That would be awesome.  And it would become the de facto standard for bitcoin security that can be accessed by regular people.

Except that FinCen is going to make L-N a money transmitter business designation, and all such nodes will have to do AML-KYC functions, otherwise operate against the law. That leaves main chain for the institutional investors to load up on their hoards. BTC is well on its way to become the world's reserve currency, and the bankers will create and tradetheir own permissioned Dimon-coins, but those will be quoted in BTC. So they all are loading up quietly hoping no one will notice.  But the inside guys are whispering to their friends, and the game is on.

I always have believed that reciprocal rules incentivises the right behaviors.

Since I had written those posts, I have established a truly random, high entropy brainwallet passphrase, and a second different truly random, high entropy passphrase for the BIP38 encryption. I now use this approach for my cold storage.

The one question I have about the Coinbase paper wallets is: "Does Coinbase still have a record of the address and private key after they generate a paper wallet?"  Is their paper wallet only known to you, or is the paper wallet just a record of an existing private key?  There is a big difference, particularly with respect to government takeover.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:39:02
There is a source that provides this capability already.  It is bit2factor.org
I've been able to create my own encrypted deterministic brainwallet by combining bitaddress.org's brainwallet capability with bit2factor.org's BIP38 capability.  The process is quite slow and prone to making errors with all that cutting and pasting.  But it does work quite well.

I believe it is for converting regular private keys into encrypted private keys.  Do a Google search on BIP38 to go to the wiki page that talks about it.
If you want to experiment, check out bit2factor.org where you can encrypt private keys and see how it works.
Yes, you are right in that it uses a scrypt approach to slow down the calculation process (you can see it live by encrypting a private key -- it is slow).
