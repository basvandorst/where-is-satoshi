Correct :-)

I never got myself to learn how to tip, but now I'm decided to learn. Thanks for this!
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:29:51
You have to apply for an invite first, but their services well worth the wait!

Who needs dogecoin when whe have bits? :-)
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:12:13

Let's hope so, but if you look at the 30 day chart, it's not so clear that it begins just yet.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:37:10
The title had me hoping bitcoin was integrated into a sims game... 
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:49:46
Yup, so basically PayPal will allow merchants to take bitcoin trough Braintree!
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:22:59
I think nothing happened or if it did, nobody cared :-)
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:17:03
Yup, for scamming most likely. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:37:30
Interesting.. "a PayPal company"
I guess this is good news...
@_date: 2014-09-09 09:18:29
Thank you for the updates!
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:43:16
Sure hope so!
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:41:26
I think that more and more mining centralization is the biggest problem.
@_date: 2014-09-23 04:18:56
Yup, all the wallets that I know of can scan the amount too.
For android try Mycelium.
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:25:25
This. 
Also they will soon implement HD wallets!
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:30:55
Show us the revised version. Thanks, 1 biscuit !
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:41:35
Thx! Will sure do! I also started tipping on twitter, and hope they will add facebook soon!
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:34:33
Yupyyy, now I just saw that circle.com opened signups for everybody!!!
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:07:54
I can tell you it is working fine with cc in Romania (only those without 3D secure), not sure about the fees though. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:35:34
Haha, so funny and true!
@_date: 2014-09-24 03:55:38
Yeah, sure, you can basically send with no-fee with confirmation in under 1h. But I would not recommend it. No reason to risk. Like you said, at least a few satoshies will do the trick!
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:11:45
Yeah, ask for an invite on circle.com 
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:25:13
Very ingenious! 
We would need just one big cash mover to start using this idea and the rest would follow.
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:32:36

The ones with 3D secure enabled did not work a week ago in Romania. Other credit cards work just fine.
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:47:05
Wooow you are right! 
I could not believe the title!!!
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:45:39
It "fell 1% in early Monday Asian trading to $1.6165, and also fell almost 1% against the euro to 1.2527 Euro."
We need more and bigger waves for the system to crash!

@_date: 2014-09-08 06:37:57
You could get lucky and find a good price on LocalBitcoins.com from someone selling bitcoins in your vicinity. 
Also circle.com lets you buy using your credit card, but for now you need an invite in order to sign-up. You can ask for one on their website.

Yup, before Bitcoin I could not care less about money and banks. 
Now I'm way more educated and aware of the thieves that profit from the collective sweat of humanity and I'm thankful we at least have a chance with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:28:37
Yup, paying with bitcoin it's a pleasure! 
The problem is that it's still kinda of a hassle to buy those bitcoins back in most countries...

I simply cannot comprehend what you are doing on this reddit if you believe bitcoins are "just numbers". Why are you here?
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:24:32
And all his comments are about prasing circle... strange indeed...
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:14:23
So many fallacies in your response... no time to tackle them all.... 
Can you at least understand that hoarding increases the price of bitcoin (not in USD terms, but in material value terms) and we NEED at least a 10x - 1000x bigger market cap for Bitcoin in order to be able to trade bigger assets WITHOUT huge market price swings?
People won't simply 'agree' to trade bitcoin at a bigger value because you wish it to be so. The market will set the price, and savers (holders) in bitcoin have a HUGE role in this!
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:14:45
Two years ago. But since that time is gone, NOW is the second best time!
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:54:47
You are right except for the "stop hoarding" advice. 
If nobody wanted to keep bitcoins, the price would plummet, the whole market cap would be negligible, and you could not buy a house with bitcoins for example because all the bitcoins in existence would not amount to that value!
Remember, people hoarding/saving bitcoin are an ESSENTIAL part of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem!
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:31:49
Depends on your perspective and expectations I guess...
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:34:30
Cool. Nice summary!
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:41:35
Coinbase and Bitstamp have their own fees when coverting from fiat to BTC or from BTC to fiat. Usually the fee is a percentage of the amount converted.
When you move bitcoins inside the Bitcoin network, there is a small fee you should pay to the miners, but the fee is very small, no matter the size of the transaction. (Usually 0.0001 BTC). In the future this fee will obviously decrease if the value of bitcoin goes up.
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:55:19
Nice, maybe they fixed it!
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:40:10
Among other things that violate the constitution, yes it does...

Oh, I do spend as often as I have the chance. 
I was just suggesting that if you have some money let's say for a retirement fund and you want to seat on them until you are old, then keeping at least a portion in bitcoin might be good for everybody. I'm sure you agree keeping value in bitcoin is better than keeping it in USD or EUR

This is the video that got him to change his mind about bitcoin: 
@_date: 2014-09-23 04:04:12
If there is someone you know, you might ask them nice or not nice to give the money back, but if there is someone online, that you don't know, then you better start buying other bitcoins and learn from you mistakes.
