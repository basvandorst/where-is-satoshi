Hello, sorry for an unrelated chainlink question, but I can't find help anywhere. 
I found and old file sitting on my computer since 2015 named. Bitcoin with a bunch of random words.
I suspect it is a menometic or what it is called bitcoin adress, but the problem is that it is 27 words. And I can't find any website that redeems 27 words seeds

if it scales linearly wich i don't think it does that would imply 150*8 MB = 1.2 GB bandwidth a day.

No but you could verify that your transaction is legit, that's the whole thing with Bitcoin, that it is trustless
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:37:20
To validate your own transactions
