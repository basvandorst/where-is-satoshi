Hmm that's confusing.

2014 -&gt; 2017 was a pretty long time to recover. Just keep in mind it might be years before you see 19k again. I've been around since it hit $1, so I'm not going anywhere.

If you know that people are trying to manipulate the market into making bitcoin cheap and it's worth way more in reality then you should act on that information instead of complaining about it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:23:45
Maybe.  Crypto "currencies" aren't going away though. Always good to diversify and never invest more than you can't afford to lose.

Hey I use shit coins as hedge against bitcoin, while also holding bitcoin. Mostly because of the holier than thou attitudes like yours here.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:29:51
So the thing the main website tells you to install shouldn't be used?
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:57:51
Honestly though the MA is really good, you can just adjust from the 200 to something like the 300 if you wanna be more conservative.  If just means you lose more upside.  Markets flow in cycles and smoothing price out over large time scales reviles underlying trends.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:56
You know some of us hold lots of coins including bitcoin?  You people who put all your eggs in one basket and will defend it to death are really strange to me.  It's not a religion or a football team, get over that mentality. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:54:44
The problem you are describing though is one of time scale.  Have you ever done any active trading using a tick chart?  Literally every tick of the market is new plot on the chart.  It's super volatile.  The further you scale back the smoother the trend becomes.  The 200 DMA is pretty smooth, even with bitcoin.  If that's not good enough you can just scale out to the weekly or the monthly.

Why on earth would you follow news related to it if you wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole?  Seems like a giant waste of time to me, time spent hating on shit...

The revolutionary concept here that you're overlooking is the blockchain itself.  It's a concept that will be with humanity for a long long time. There are many uses for it other than crypto currencies too.. As for bitcoin itself, who knows, maybe a better currency will come to replace it.  Blockchain based currencies are here to stay.

Umm.. JonWickedFire was not from fox news.  He's just the owner of a affiliate marketing forum.  Why Mark talked to him I have no idea.  Fox news just took the log and posted it, they had nothing to do with it.
Jon posted it here first:

I just tried 8 different withdrawals, 3 made it. Two .01's and .05.  Nothing over .05 worked for me and now I have a stupid amount of money just "missing".  Getting kinda worried.

I also bought a tv from overstock, just got it yesterday and everything was perfect. Glad to hear they have our backs if anything were to go wrong.

Umm if you're gpu mining why wouldn't you mine on waffle pool or middle coin? You mine scrypt altcoins and get btc in the end..
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:33:03
It's still pretty profitable. .01 btc per megahash per day. Your hash rate will be different than sha mining though. In the end I guarantee it will be be vastly more profitable than mining btc directly.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:12:22
How did that work out for you?  Did the transactions go through?
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:28:35
This is from someone who would have probably been in the "640k ought to be enough for anyone" camp back in 1981.
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:35:23
By definition anything being sent to your inbox is email.  Anything being confirmed into the blockchain is a transaction.  The solution to email spam was not to start limiting how many emails people could send, artificial limits are not the answer. I don't know what is, but proverbially sticking your head in the sand is silly.

We are at like 9.8% though on the s&amp;p, over 10% on the nasdaq and 8.6 on the dow, so like maybe set that alarm for the next few days. Totally agree that this is needed though.
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:58:10
600 points in day is kinda meaningless.  -2.4% however isn't that bad.  We did have a -6% day recently and that is pretty bad.  [Considering the top 20]( worst days it almost made that list. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:19:13
I started buying somewhere around $5-$10. Whats everyone so upset about again?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:29:00
Not exactly, if less people are willing to sell it lower that also drives price up.

Hmm, we don’t have any malls in Dublin. Unless you thinking about tuttle, which is in Columbus.

If 1 bitcoin was worth say $1000 usd then instead of everyone dealing in whole bitcoins, they would start dealing in say 1µ bitcoins (micro bit coins) or nano coins or whatever.

There's no way to know how close your client is towards finding a block.  There is a way to know the average number of attempts needed, but you could potential find the right block on your first hash.
@_date: 2011-06-22 17:19:57
Indeed it would be, though from what I heard in an interview with them they weren't opposed to paying out a bounty to people who hacked them and privately disclosed the vulnerability.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:00:30
If MtGox was indeed hacked via sql injection then I don't see what good moving your servers is.  Should probably make sure your developer used prepared statements to do your sql instead of trying to filter for injection.

Actually someone who works for google is in the  channel on freenode and marked all the gmail accounts as compromised.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:18:36
MySQL injection just makes so much more sense than some mysterious financial auditor getting owned, I mean what are the odds that someone would have stumbled upon the right machine at the right time there.  
MagicalTux really needs to step up and confess the truth about what happened.  Either way, MtGox is toast..
TLDR:  Two scripts were supposedly vulnerable to injection, claim.php and getActivity.php.


[21:43:41] &lt;Wasplet2&gt; iDisplayStart, iDisplayLength, sSortDir_0 all were vulnerable
@_date: 2011-06-23 06:56:20
Heres the [log]( of the chat where he said he would do it.  MagicalTux = Owner of MtGox.
I still think this guys a liar and the whole hack story makes no sense to me, but at least he still has control over those coins..
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:31:14
Ahh it's about time we got a opensource exchange.  Just spoke with one of the devs, he said they are rewriting it, hopefully he'll take my advice about the prepared statements.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:02:22
This would require a degree of selflessness and humility that he does not posses.  Just another digital tyrant who aims to rule and control over something he certainly considers "his".
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:33:22
When someone attacks you like that it’s because your statement rings too close to home for them.

Thats what you get for not enabling two factor authentication in the security center.  I bet you used the same password on some other website or your computer is owned and you have no idea.  It's so hard for people to take personal responsibility for their own mistakes, way easier to blame someone else...
Edit: Sorry btw, it sucks to get robbed.  Please download google authenticator on your smart phone and enable it in security center, it would have meant that for anyone to withdraw they would need your cell phone and not just your password.

Can you explain the process a little more in depth?  I have both a bit instant account and see nothing about zipmark in it.  I also have the zipmark app and see nothing about bitinstant in there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:07:50
This happens because of the trade engine lag I think,  because people cannot adjust orders in real time the spread between the buyers and sellers gets huge.  I saw the market move 50btc in one trade if the data out of bitcoinity was correct.

When reddit detects that a user is a vote bot it automatically stops counting it's upvotes/downvotes.  By hiding the real amount of upvotes and downvotes  that a post or comment has they can prevent the bot or it's owner from knowing it's been "stealth banned".

Bitcoin is not a replacement for credit, but currency.  You should be asking why you would rather use Bitcoins vs USD.  You can't send someone USD in 10 minutes across the internet directly with no involvement from some outside party like paypal.

gone are the days of gpu mining with a single card, especially one that can only do 23mhash.  High end cards pull 700-800.
