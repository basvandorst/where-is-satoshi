I was in SOf's bar. It's really amazing!
 I forgot my wallet with all the cards and cash at home in that day and I  was saved by paying using  BTC. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:01:49
How fast time flies! I thought it was 2 years ago.
PS Happy bitcopizza day!

Where is the ATM situated? Is it provided anytime access to it? How much is the commission? It accept only dollars or euro?
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:10:40
Congrats! 
PS Now I can drink coffee even if I forgot my wallet at home ;)

I wonder where he learned about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:46:55
what a meaningless analysis.
(A) $500 +$5 = $505
(B) $480 +$24= $504
(C) $460 +$40= $500
(D) $460 +$40 +$5= $505
its been proven time and time again that:
someone can exchange coins at the most expensive exchange and put a 1% fee ontop(A).
someone can exchange coins at the medium expense exchange and put a 5% fee ontop(B).
someone can exchange coins at the lowest expense exchange and not tell a soul and pretend its fee free by mentioning a different expensive exchange pretending its fee free(C).
someone can exchange at the cheapest exchange, but use the most expensive exchange for customer display to say they only take 1%
whether the prices have fee's on or not. the end number you are then shown, does not match another providor who advertises the same fee
all of which prove that it does not really matter what the fee is. BITCOIN IS VOLATILE!! your never going to get the lowest price in existance, so get use to paying a premium in some form or another no matter how its hidden, manipulated, worded!

Nice story about how Bitcoin can change your birthday 
@_date: 2014-05-22 04:40:18


ITA! The main problem is that banks don't want to recognize its inconsistency. Today the Federal Reserve System needs help from the outside, which Bitcoin  is able to provide
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:09:46
everyone make sure not to use too much power or the cops are gonna break down your door and arrest you, even if you didn't do anything wrong. this the motherfuicking proff! 
how much weed did he have???
why did they take the computers?Huh
is it illegal to have computers!?
this is fucking BS.
sue the bastards for the missed mining income, make them pay in BTC.

Sounds super cool but Reddit is centralized, how can it become a decentralized media platform? I think this project could fly, but it should be based on a decentralized platform (something like Maidsafe etc.).

Speculation is the reason. IMO. Not many are coming into bitcoin as users right now. They are trying to get rich speculating. Growth comes from utility not from hope.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:40:21
It's good marketing move! It can be used to provide an introduction Bitcoin as  payment in many companies B/C demand creates supply.  And  will the entrepreneur abandon profit?
@_date: 2014-04-30 07:10:06
I use a web wallet  but want to change for its safety. Can you describe the benefits of paper purse? Is it safer? Is it easy to use?
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:20:08
I'm support the idea to create an ecosystem on campus at MIT. Your post confirms the correctness of my judgment.
 I hope that the best minds of the country will help to develop Bitcoin in a short time.
@_date: 2014-05-22 04:50:49
The government wants to get as much tax. They don't care about "double standards" thus  they need to decide is Bitcoin property or means of payment
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:41:46
I think it's great! Do you noticed how many companies are open to innovations? 
 I'm especially glad that Indiegogo will begin its work with cryptocurrency
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:54:13
It's cool! I need to download this app
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:32:48
I don't understand  is such service necessary?
 Can anyone explain this to me.
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:48:40
Have you compared the price of the telescope in different stores? Did you got benefit from the use of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:22:37


I think this idea makes sense!
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:22:24
I got the meaning like that they are invented to be a useful standard for financial transaction which make independent system interconnected with each other. And as the standard grow complete,  kinds of platform can works together.

Earlier people looked with disdain upon the man with a mobile phone, and today it is the normal. The same will happen with Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:27:21
Bitcoin's development is delayed because there is a lot of people with old-fashioned mind who like to feel money that they own. ITA with this post!
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:09:53
ITA! I always say this to all my friends cos no one understands why do I need Bitcoin and how it works. 
PS Ashton Kutcher is an open-minded man for innovative ideas. He's cool!
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:14:37
Is Bitcoin the only means of payment which you accept?  How long are you going to provide 5 %  discount?
Ps Is  the number of customers increased since the introduction of Bitcoins as payment?
@_date: 2014-06-22 03:01:22
I'm glad to hear it. Is there access to the ATM 24-hours-a-day?
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:32:59
I'm going to use circle when I can and buy off credit card, I am too paranoid about my bank account being connected.
@_date: 2014-04-30 06:56:45
It's a stupid idea! Is someone really need to legalize of marijuana? IMO financing of legalization marijuana using Bitcoins will be black PR for all cryptocurrency
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:51:03
2nd heavily populated country to be introduced to Bitcoin... It might give a little bit of a push to the further adoption.
