You're getting a little ahead of the reality on the ground here. Directly button patients are actually used today. All the claims about lightning networks are totally speculative and do come with the real downsides of using a 3rd party LN service. Improvements to the real bitch payment protocol are more important because everything else is built on top of this. Not the other way around.

Yes, and this protocol would substantially improve it for the many, many low volume users who are and will be making nice, normal transactions of the kind Bitcoin was invented to facilitate.

Honestly, if this is actually what you think.  It's a pretty vacuous position.  Are you suggesting that Adam Black is an idiot, yourself, the miners?  If he's just saying something that you agree is a bad idea, then he's dumb.  If he's saying something that you agree is a good idea, then you're being willfully dense at best, and the fact that you took the effort to even reply is confusing.  You're like a bot, or a shill being paid to just support whatever comes across this subreddit even if it doesn't make sense?
It makes the most sense to just assume you have no idea what you're talking about here.

Oh, you're investing in their company? Why are you writing about it here instead of just taking with the board of directors?

Yes. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:51:12
Yeah, that's not free.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:16:59
That doesn't even make sense.  That just means other people would verify all transactions.

It's the same as regular Bitcoin for most purposes.  Its essentially an altcoin that can be deleted at any moment by the devs who run it, this is what makes it "test" instead of "Bitcoin 2"
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:03:48
Aye 
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:55:00
I understand your point.  What I'm saying is, "I'm sorry but what your describing doesn't make sense in the bitcoin network."  The bitcoin block chain isn't structured like email, which it sounds like is what you're modeling.  What you're describing would just waste miner's time and slow down everyone's transactions by a tiny bit.  
You're thinking that miner's vote on which transactions they like and which they don't like, but since it doesn't work like that: I don't think that does what you think it does.

Well when you're right you're right, but I still think that's a high standard quality to hold for this situation involving 8th graders teaching other 8th graders and adults about Bitcoin for the first time.  
Without over analyzing it, I'd say that Bitcoin is so foreign to people that by explaining how it's radically different from cash is a better starting point for educating them on the topic than actual practical advice that they would need once they're sold on the idea.   That "Bitcoin is a thing",  outside this subreddit, is the entry-level standard of intellectual discourse on this topic.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:37:31
That sound like a next generation financial service to me! You're right that is the simple solution, but there is a reason almost no industries finance their operations this way.  It's confusing to people (People meaning grandma, not r/bitcoin readers), and it can't actually cover the risk without making it unaffordable for the poor. And it's pretty reasonable to pay for a $5 ride in an urgent situation without having to also have $150 in disposable income in the bank as well. So big businesses finance this through the credit system. You can use bitcoin for credit card style lending as well, but in businesses like this, that transaction fee is actually paying for a real insurance service.

You're correct outside of this context, but in this context, every human soul who saw this meeting would think you're crazy for suggesting they might do that, after you took the time to explain what that even means to them. The relationship between most people and Bitcoin will be exactly the same as the relationship began most people and most money, through some kind of knowledgeable intermediary service like a bank or exchange.
@_date: 2016-02-27 07:43:32
This is an existing capability of the Bitcoin being utilized.  This is not new core development, but it is a really cool application of some interesting algorithms, and Bitcoin is perfect for this.
Edit: they did add functionality to the wallet to help execute this type of trade.

Accountability and transparency are big deals in business. This makes complete sense. It isn't like these people are friends.

You weirdly picked giant cities with no adequate food production in the city limits compared to their size. I don't think you understand the impact of automotive technology outside a very narrow short term lens.

Yeah, only a fool would get in an automobile ambulance. Total hype. I take a horse or walk when I have a medical emergency. 
Also there are tons of prescription drug related deaths every year. We should really reconsider medication.

A DHT is a way of finding specific Hashed content in a Distributed imaginary Table of content.  You have to already be connected to the Distributed network first, which is the same problem OP is talking about.
