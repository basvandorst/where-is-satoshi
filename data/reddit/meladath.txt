Yeah. It's called making an ICO fork based on ETH. Seems everyone is doing it nowadays.

Thank blockstream and their arbitrary 1MB block limit.
EDIT: kek just saw you are another guy who somehow believe big blocks = centralised. Just seriously think about it for a few minutes and it makes LITERALLY NO SENSE, even a fucking raspberry pi can handle 8MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:34
Potentially could cause that, yes. The fees for anything to be confirmed within the next few blocks is absurdly high. Coinbase has sometimes fucked people crashing during times and you end up with 3/4 what you expected because it gave you a different price or had a huge fee. Or people having orders never go though. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:01:54
Pretty sure this is 100% a scam. Bitcoin doesnt work like that. This isn't possible.

@_date: 2017-12-08 10:46:07
Lol poor you. BTC is going to plummet soon. I recommend get out now.
EDIT for all the 14 year old downvotes: It dropped more than 15.3, I was right. (yes, you could "just hodl" dank memes btw kids, but you end up with less profit in the long run!)
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:35:15
You cant do anything. If you were using a wallet that allowed you to control fees, you could attempt a manual fee amount, but given the current horror state of the mempool, you will want AT LEAST 100 satoshis per byte, or you risk your transaction being stuck for weeks in limbo. Essentially you have to outbid anyone else who has a transaction in that block with your fee. Or it doesn't go through.
On blockchain, you could convert it all to ether, then send the ether, which could then be converted back to BTC (if the recipient wanted BTC anyway). That is a way to avoid paying the fees yourself, instead shifting them onto the recipient if they want to change it.
Tough shit (literally). Sorry, the developers of bitcoin (blockstream) recently decided they DID NOT need to increase the 1MB block limit, and the insanely high fees we are facing right now are completely fine, and will be magically all fixed with lightning network.
(funnily enough, segwit was also supposed to solve everything, look where that got us!).
I suggest looking into other altcoins, such as a recent fork of bitcoin which appeared if you actually want to USE the currency.
EDIT: Lol downvote.. for what? Providing factual information and answering OP's question? The core shills on this sub are real.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:49:23
If you wish to send bitcoins directly to a service to use it (like you said) I don't think there are many solutions other than paying the fee.. Unless they accept other crypto?
Every solution involves paying at least a BTC fee, either to send it to an exchange to swap it, or sending it to nitrogensports.
Unfortunately you cant swap it in your wallet to ether then send it if they do not accept ether.
I am sorry, I can't think of anything other than simply paying the insane fee.
Maybe someone else can think of a way to help you out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:59:50
Good slippery slope argument you got going on there.
Bitcoin cash is based on the original whitepaper of bitcoin. Not the one that blockstream have been editing for a while now. Which is incredibly easy to see if you just take a while to browse.
Not to mention THE 1MB BLOCK LIMIT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY WHILST BITCOIN WAS WORTH ALMOST NOTHING. Kinda a pretty damn huge deal really.
I prefer the idea of bitcoin, not paypal 2.0. Thats why I prefer the fork.
Blockstream are just the people that hold the private keys to the git repo.... therefore they control the entire codebase... therefore they control the entire project. Thats kinda how software development and version control works.
I don't know about you, but I heavily dislike the idea of a single company in control of the entire codebase of a cryptocurrency which I choose to put my faith into.

Exactly. We are doooooooomed!
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:45:58
The problem is bitcoin itself, sorry, but the developers have fucked you over with their lovely 1mb block limit. A certain fork of bitcoin appeared recently because of it. Apparently (devs have said and some other bitcoin users) bitcoins isn't for people who cant afford the fees. I guess you can decide if you like the sound of that yourself or not.
Average fee for confirmation within the next 6 block is $14 per transaction right now. Which is absolutely insane. Right now we have over a month of time where transactions haven't been confirmed below certain fees.
Always check  and see what the lowest fee that got through the last block was. Then set your fee around that level. It's the best way to pay the least amount possible and still get confirmed, right now, its around 120-150 sat/B.
I suggest reading up on other alternative crypto coins if you actually want to use them (which is kinda the point of a currency, no?)
Bitcoin does support RBF which allows you to "increase" the fee of a previous transaction, increasing the chance it gets through. Certain wallets support this, and it will allow you to try to get it confirmed quicker, although I am not sure if its any help to you now, you will have to check that yourself.

Why buy 1 whole bitcoin, and at that crazy high price? it hasnt been 17k since yesterday. Should have bought 0.5 BTC, 1 BCH, 2 ETH, 10 LTC, 5 XMR.
Not just 1 BTC. You will make WAYYYYY MORE money. Portfolio breadth is the key to avoiding panic selling/all or nothing.
Also, following since 2013 but not investing? You must have been insane, crypto was so cheap back then you could have just gotten a single litecoin for almost nothing...
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:38
That is correct. But the reduction is very small, not enough to make any real difference, even if it was 100% adopted it would only decrease fees by a small amount.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:24:51

If im being honest, I mined a load of coins, bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, novacoin, few others, back in 2012. crypto was one of the most important things in my life until around the time ASICs were developed. I pretty much stopped being interested at that point. Only started up mining again and generally looking at crypto again (I decided a few years break would be good, I still kept an eye on the price) about a year ago, but not BTC any more.
But yeah, never heard of him until like a month ago.

There is nothing to do. They are literally locked up in the mempool. The developers recently increased the maximum mempool timeout from 3 days, to 3 months (for god knows whatever reason? Obviously they knew lots were going to get caught up for over 3 days!). Default however by most clients is 2 weeks.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:55
It's the second biggest high so far, and is rising far quicker than in may. Difficulty went up quite a lot. And yes I was, huge amounts of unconfirmed transactions end up driving up fees to huge amounts so...
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:04:55
Thats literally how it works yes. You just run a program on the PC and leave it. You obviously have to restart it if it crashes, or restart the PC if it crashes. But you can leave a rig on for weeks on end generally.  
I don't believe it uses much bandwidth, but I live in the EU so I havent even looked into it because its not a concern of mine. A gaming computer will suffice. Most mining rigs run the cheapest CPU + 4GB of the cheapest RAM + huge PSU + loads of GPUs.
You need lots of GPU's mainly. However you wont be able to mine bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash or some others with gpu's. (Any coin that uses the SHA-256 or Scrypt algorithm) as the network difficulty is far too high to make it profitable this is because ASIC miners (special dedicated chips JUST for bitcoin mining and nothing else) came about and are like 50x faster and are more efficient than GPUs at mining.
So unless you want to buy an ASIC miner (generally, very expensive, but there are some smaller cheaper ones), you will have to mine altcoins. Monero seems good for profit in the past few months, as it seems to be the most profiable for the wattage thats put in, however ethereum is also good, and supported on far more exchanges. BUT ANYWAY there are lots of cryptocurrencies and each of them are worth their own amount... checkout whattomine.com
With very little effort you generally make $1.5 a day each GPU (assuming its something like a 470/480/570/580).
If you really tweak things, you can obviously make more.
The ROI for a mining rig is actually insanely high compared to almost any other investment you can make, most rigs pay for themselves within a year.
How much you make HIGHLY depends on how much you pay for your electricity. I pay $0.18 per KWh, and I only pay about 50 cents a day per card. Each card generally creates something like $1.5-3 worth of crypto a day, so mines off your electricity costs and you have profit left over.

@_date: 2017-12-11 12:16:13


What? How did you manage to reach that conclusion lmfao?


No it won't, that is absolutely insanely absurd FUD talking. Do you know how much a zettabyte is? And how bitcoin handles its transactions? Because if you understand both... you would instantly know that its simply an impossibility that blocks could get THAT big for simple mass consumer adoption.
Maybe if we ruled the entire universe, and inhabited every single planet, and ONLY bitcoin cash existed with no other currency at all. Then maybe I could see zettabyte blocks. But I imagine it would be changed to fix it before that happens.
VISA level transactions across the globe would only require 128MB blocks. There is some pretty simple math behind it tbh.


Correct. Which is why changes need to happen. Change in a way that goes with the original vision of the project. Not change which is forced upon the code by a single group of people controlling the code and seeing fit to delete and ban hundreds of posts/users from their subreddit.....

Welcome to the world of cryptocurrency. I would recommend going onto coinbase and buying $10-50 each of bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.
NEVER buy more crypto if you cant pay the bills.
I highly recommend not day trading, as its very hard to get into and costly with high risk. But if you do, for the love of god, buy LOW, sell HIGH. Do NOT sell when the price is dropping, sell when the price is GOING UP, buy when the price is GOING DOWN. Or, buy into another crypto. 
Having a wide portfolio will instantly make sure "something comes of it". But yes, crypto is the future.
