Spread between Zebpay buy &amp; sell price is high. We are here talking about remittance from USA to India. Current USA price of Bitcoin is 607 dollars. If someone buys Bitcoin in USD he pays 607 * 67 ( INR to dollar rate) = ₹41000. Against that, if they transfer to India and sell at Zebpay, they get ₹41600. So, inshort they actually make more than 1%.
