Thanks for your post. Will definitely keep an eye on it.

Bought in today in a big way after trying to buy since 10k.
Will see what happens next week, I'm hoping that long term the price will be a multiple of what it is now.
I will wait until it is double and a bit, sell half to cover my original investment + taxes on gains.
If it goes the other way long term..... Well I'm young i guess... :)

Oh man! Don't tell me this :(
Just made my first transfer to them today over 19K. The first of three I was planning.
I was wondering should I send them a mail to let them know some funds are on the way or not. Or just wait until it becomes a problem, if it becomes a problem.
What do you guys think? Some of the info required by them didn't fit fully into my banks wire transfer form so I had to write outside the designated areas (reference, bank name etc.)
Hopefully all this won't be an issue...
Also first Reddit post!

It's crazy that in the time it takes to sober up/get over a hangover, Bitcoin price is somewhere completely different.
Talk about moral hangovers the next day lol.

I still wrote all the details there. If the wire transfer is read by a human there SHOULD be no issue I would imagine. If it is read by machine however and the reference, for example, was to long to fit in the designated area on the form then I might have a problem... :(
Also in the payment instructions it told me to "Please instruct your bank and the bank's intermediary bank(s) to not convert the deposit into JPY."
Did you do that? I just made a note of it in "other instructions", hope that suffices.
It wasn't (or I didn't see it specified anywhere) clear to me how I should deal with the wire transfer costs either so to be on the safe side I didn't do SHA. I am paying all the costs as sender...
