This article is terrible. Reads like an intro to MLM, especially when it tells you how much money you can make before actually telling you anything about how to become a developer.

About a month ago I casually mentioned out loud - to myself, mostly -  how bitcoin had breached 10k and someone actually replied, "Why do you think I would be in any way interested in that?" So screw 'em, I keep it to myself now.
edit: this was at work, I was at my desk, others were around. I work in tech with a lot of engineers and not one is invested in crypto.

"Rumor is" + no source = talking out of your ass.

I was thinking 15k by Friday, 20k by next week sounds even better!

0.5-1%. The other 99+% is my home, car, stocks, pension, and cash.

I'm surprised it took this long.

I just received a Nano S this week and by default it had 24 words, which I wrote down, then it asks to confirm all 24 words. Didn't see an option for 12 words during the setup. Also, I made the mistake of ordering off Amazon instead of directly from the Ledger site. Should I reset the seed words?
