People are laughing at you and downvote you for 2 VERY simple reasons. 
1) It is public knowledge that Tyler worked for little more than 40 Years at Wall Street. You don't work at Wall Street if you are a con-man that doesn't know how to invest/trade.
2) He is the creator of a theory Called "Hyperwave Theory".
It is also public knowledge that there hasn't been a Hyperwave that failed as of 2019. To put it simply so even you can understand it, Hyperwave Theory as of 2019 has an 100% success rate, and it's the only Technical Analysis theory with an 100% success rate.
(Bitcoin will officially be the exception ONLY IF it makes Higher Highs without reaching the 1-2k $ Area first. This hasn't been done yet though)
So when you try to debunk something that is public knowledge and can be found with a just few Google searches , you understand that , that makes you look EXTREMELY VERY Stupid.

You are actually right, no one cared about him before Bitcoin.
Except Wall Street of course. They decided to hire him for about 41-42 Years. What a bunch of dumb people those Wall street guys, they hire a con man for so many Years LUL am I right Reddit pleb ?

Please give me 3 examples of the Hyper Wave theory been proven wrong.
If you can't do it, please go ahead and hang yourself, because people like you do more bad than good in this society.
You can't claim that "Hyperwave theory has not a single time been accurate" when the FACT is that Hyperwave theory has not one time been wrong since the day it was invented.
And don't say Bitcoin because unless the price is currently above 20k then the hyperwave has not yet failed in BTC

I was watching a Youtuber I enjoy watching, and although I always wanted to have my Value in Bitcoin , he got me sold in GBTC , since I enjoy trading and i guess that's easier with GBTC.
He is not very open about what Platform he is using though, so I was wondering if anyone can recognize it.
Thank you upfront ^^
