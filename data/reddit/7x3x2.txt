I get the same with any altcoin. Most are faster and cheaper. If Bitcoin wants to stay in business on the longterm something needs to be done about the fees. Bitcoin certainly has the adoption right now but if the situation stays like that I guess people will look for better solutions.

It's a win, win situation for me, so here you go.

Maybe you should get a better bank. I pay 0.00 € for my account and 0.00 € per transaction in the Euro zone.
Also you 10 cents isn't so bad if you transfer 100€, but what if you want to buy something for just 1€.

Yes higher blocksize, higher throughput. It's funny how in Bitcoin it is possible that two people talking about the same do not agree sometimes.
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:02:06
I would not call that a blocksize increase. The base blocksize stays the same, the extension data increases. This is not a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:23:08
The block size stays the same. Transactions actually become a little bigger (correct me if I am wrong). The difference is that parts of the transactions don't have to be saved in the block chain but in a new database. Apparently it would be possible to fit about 1.7 amount of transactions in a block then. 
It solves other problems really well but not the block size problem. I don't know why people say it is a solution for this throughput problem. But because of the other problems it actually solves it would be possible to implement a system which would allow secure transactions without the block chain. This would decrease the amount of transactions needed and therefore increase the throughput. (this system is lightning network)

That is actually a big problem. You cannot remove segwit because for non segwit clients the transactions look like transactions everybody can spend. So it would just not be possible to remove segwit completely. (without losing funds)
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:02:50
With throughput I meant how many transaction are possible in a certain time. And yes there would be an easy solution, blocksize increase. This obviously also has drawbacks but this would be the easy solution for the transaction throughput problem.

OK, yes in segwit there is no 1MB block size limit anymore but a 4 MB block weight limit, consisting of 1MB base size and 3MB for witness data. Call it base size, call it block size, call it whatever, you should know what I am talking about. Old nodes still see it as the blocksize limit and would not accept blocks bigger than 1MB.
There we are, back again at what I said. You have a max of 1MB of base size (max block size for old nodes) and max 3MB for segwit data (ignored by old nodes). If a block only has P2PKH transactions (old style transactions) there would be no segwit data.
Also if it is so important so important for you to use the exact terms, then there is obviously no block size increase with segwit, because there is no block size constraint anymore, but a block weight constraint (at least for new nodes). (:

No. Normally the pro of a soft fork is that it is not as crucial for old clients to update. Because they also accept the new transactions as valid. They just think the new transactions are strange and also cannot spend them anymore. I do not really see the pros of a soft fork over a hard fork. Even with segwit there could be a fork.
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:58:48
I just explained you why it is not.
OK let's verse it differently. Let's suppose segwit gets implemented and there is block with only P2PKH transaction. What is the maximum blocksize? Right, 1 MB.

I am saying what I think. You cannot disprove that. And yes I have seen lots of BU supporters who also support segwit. Most BU supporters just want BU because they don't want core.

We are talking about the same thing. I just do not agree. In my opinion this is not a block size increase.

From the original thread: 


@_date: 2017-05-04 13:46:55
That is not true. Of course there are people on both sides who take the whole thing too seriously. But people who take stuff too seriously are most of the time also the loudest. There are lots of people on both sides who are reasonable.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:36:39
Hashpower reflects miners. Obviously miners are not thrilled about a solution which allows off chain transactions. Also I am not talking about BU developers, I don't know what their stance on segwit is. I am talking about supporters of BU.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:27:25
Please tell me where exactly I am wrong (:
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:25:24
I am "demonstrably" right because I can show you BU supporters who are for segwit.
I am saying that lots of BU supports are just strongly against Core and think that BU is the lesser evil. Core is not just segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:11:35
As far as I know most BU supports also support segwit. BU supports do not support the Core development team and would also like a blocksize increase before activating segwit.

Why is there not 2MBSegwit?
