To be honest, what most people first ask is "What will I gain?" 
I think a vid/ picture depiction of btc's rise in value + the borderless nature of its transactions is what can convince people. 
Being able to send funds anywhere in the world without any form of restriction is a big plus for btc.
Most wont really want to delve into anonymity at first, but the idea of money that can be hidden is appealing.
Also i think the blockchain technology is greatly underlooked. People need to see the potential in a decentralised open ledger system
gifs or short vids should do the trick. Hope that helps.

Seems bitcoin charges are very little compared to fiat. But that depends on account type and where you stay.

Most likely he made a mistake while typing your address manually. 
If that is not the case the site should (theoratically) reverse it. 
Try using bitref.com to confirm if the coins did leave his wallet.
