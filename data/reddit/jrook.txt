How do you get to be so bad at analogies? Is it drugs? Because I've seen some shitty analogies but this one is special. Do you not understand the point of analogies?
The only thing that fits is the punch line. Its horrible. You fucking suck.

Lol so if a company is poisoning the water a posse will form to lynch those responsible?  Thank goodness we don't have regulations supported by violence! Instead we have mob rule supported by violence. 
My only question is why nobody thought of this sooner?! Paradise. 
Have you ever evaluated this while sober, just wondering?

What authority would the court have? 
Would every aspect of this society be based on the current one? Wouldn't it be easier to print out stickers saying "not" and simply put that infront of any letterhead? You know, "by order of the [not] EPA you have 30 days to cease all pollution, or the [not] police will [not] act in accordance to the blah blah blah blah"?
But seriously, what, besides "violence" would compel someone to act in accordance to any system which already has a perfect analogue in today's society?

So the person responsible for a intrical piece of infrastructure would basically be only subject to any sort of pressure if a substitute is available?

What other methods besides 'violence' would stop someone from poisoning your food or water or environment?

If you don't give any reason they assume it's for tax reasons
