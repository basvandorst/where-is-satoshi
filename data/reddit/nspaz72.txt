Getting sick to the high teeth of the scare tactic argument against crypto is only used by criminals I’ve never committed a crime in my life worked hard paid my taxes and raised a happy healthy productive family and guessing the majority of people who use crypto are in the same boat in any other walk of life these sort of unsubstantiated generalisation would lead to a law suit maybe we should start sueing these bellends for defamation of character .

I only put in 5% of wage tiny amounts looking long term I just keep it simple forget all your ta my thinking is if something rises slower than it falls and then I’m investing more going up less going down bitcoin always drops faster than it rises and the bottom is never as low as the last bottom give it a few years and an ath job done no stress ��

Sounds fun everyone should respond and just take the piss
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:43:23
It’s not a scam I’ve used it .it’s more of a bank than exchange good for purchasing coins and just partnered up with ledger so as secure as it can be but be warned don’t use as an exchange don’t be tempted to move coins around on it the spread on the coins is massive u will get fleeced .has competitive buy rates I use it to purchase the move straight into hard wallet .
Has some additional features ie Visa mco card this is more a Visa top up card 
All in all as good and bad as what’s out there middleman wise remember they are out to make money as much as you are so be careful
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:50:59

Great idea just bad application I’m sure someone will get it right but this ain’t it I guess we’ve got to accept there will be a lot of early startups who won’t quite make it if you follow crypto.com you will already see the wheels are starting to come off but best of luck to you and fortunately for me and my money I very much totally get the point ��

Best rate out there great site to buy and then cold store btc just watch the spread do your figure before you buy spread is very erratic if buying anything else
@_date: 2019-06-18 15:15:09

I was introduced to bitcoin via an alternative crypto coin project the more I’ve educated myself the more ive swayed towards bitcoin I think the same will happen with libra when people understand it’s doesn’t actually hold any benefit bar being blockchain than what’s already avalible and it being a centralised stablecoin it’s appeal will die away .those to come who educate themselves and understand the vision and future possibilities of  bitcoin,libra will  probably be first contact for many to crypto I believe majority will choose wisely I welcome them all more the merrier.

I think Facebook is slowly dying  it’s had its day the upcoming generations have already diversified away from its antiquated data hungry invasive platform .I imagine from initial white paper a select few will do very nicely out of libra as they blindly herd the Facebook community from firstly giving them all the personal data too now to taking thier money they have the power to market it to look like everyone’s a winner just remember no matter how good something sounds you don’t get something for nothing especially from a company who’s first priority is is shareholders not users.gonna be interesting to watch them slowly bleed their users convincing them this is the future wonder when the first  Libra loans will hit the market
