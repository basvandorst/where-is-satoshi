She's a keeper. 
Use her to predict the future markets.

I gotta say, cryptokitties is quite attractive hahaha. Sometimes it's just tempting to spend a bit of your crypto here and there.

Piece of crap... telling me what to do, *upvotes*

This one literally killed me. Looking forward to the anonymous abortions! Hahahaha

I believe people have some right to argue about the fee's, since a lot of people advertise Bitcoin as an effective payment system.
I believe people need to start teaching others that crypto itself is just an investment, it'll be years from now before it'll become a sustainable form of payment.
Though, I can't wait till I can buy my packet of condoms at the drug store anonymously, because fuck the system! Haha.

I guess that's the issue with Bitcoin at the moment. The long waits and transaction fees. Let's hope we can fix this in the near future.

The only reason why a 1%er would put down crypto, is because it's hurting their current investments.
Once they look into cryptocurrency investing, they'll discover the many opportunities.

At the end of the day, it's a business. All they care is that your money is in their pockets. They don't care if it's sustainable until the very end.

$1 million is a big bet. Let's hope it goes this way!

I like the idea, what we need are for merchants to be willing to take the risk. Most people won't use the payment option at this time, but it's always nice to have.

No, you don't. The only way you'll need to file for any taxes or such is if you have made a profit that you wish to cash out. 
Even if they do approach you, you can just say that it was simply a purchase rather than an investment.

Good video, 10/10. IGN

Eh, it's all debatable.

Generally what I do is I buy Bitcoin in my local exchange then send the Bitcoin to an international exchange. It's how I avoid high fees and what I do when I want to buy alt coins.
I hope your transaction goes through soon though!

Man, I wish my employer did this. Imagine the worth of all my earnings if I had an opportunity like getting paid in Bitcoin from the start.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:40:19
So glad for you! Glad Bitcoin worked in your favour!
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:03:43
I don't believe they're a scam, though you may want to contact them. A lot of exchanges have been having issues with transactions recently due to the rise of blockchain transactions.
Also, I don't recommend you using Cex.io, they're known for their extremely high fees.

Welcome to Bitcoin. It's one hell of a rollercoaster.
It get's addicting as well. Once your knowledge in Bitcoin goes up, you'll be wanting to get into Alt coins, then ICO's. After all that, you'll be looking for ways to live your life using Bitcoins.
Once you do that, you'll be telling anyone who despises Bitcoin to piss off and that it's the future and there's no stopping it.
Have fun! &lt;3

Well, I can't tell for good, but my friend who has experience says that the *bubble* is hell.
