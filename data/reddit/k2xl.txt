Fine here
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:31:39
Am I reading it wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:38:10
oh god
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:18:42
i validated the shasum it is correct
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:22:18
The BCC is in bittrex
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:14:10
clean,checked the sha1 with the developer of electroncash and it's valid.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:38:53
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:19:15
I moved coins out of coinbase to my own electrum wallet.
I moved coins from electron wallet to a new electrum wallet after aug 1st fork.
I moved coins from electroncash wallet to bittrex (yesterday). That move was successful.
Open up Electrum now and it shows a transaction was made 10 hours ago. I have no clue how anyone would have gotten my private keys. they aren't published anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:53:46
scanning now, malwarebytes says clean
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:55:59
Looking at your post history, you bragged about this in a previous post and you were asked to remove your post. You should probably do the same.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:29:20
This is the transaction 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:22:06
I downloaded from electroncash.org
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:18:08
I had a typo, it was electroncash, I validated the shasum too
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:34:11
No, it was 16mAZeBJM9AJP5FAaEqpfAkLejxMxiTFes
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:12:02
Haven't used Exodus but if you remember or wrote down your 12 word phrase you should be good to go.
And yes to the second question
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:31:57
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:09:26
Move the ones on exchange to your wallet that you own the private keys for (I'm assuming you have the private keys for your paper wallet)
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:45:13
I believe some wallets will display that conversion to fiat for you
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:59:53
Have you tried reinstalling the chrome extension?
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:41:57
You have a wallet with BTC, but the private keys for your BTC wallet will ALSO work for BCC wallet
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:08:37
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:20:14
Just BTC I believe. For the others you'll need to use private wallets for those.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:25:19
Do you own the private keys? If so than you're fine. If not, then move them over (try and follow the tutorial link I posted in original post, even though it is for coinbase)
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:13:57
Download electrum. Create wallet. Save private key somewhere super safe. 
 
Send money from coinbase to electrum wallet public address.
If you are new at using your own wallet, test things out.
Send 0.00001 BTC back and forth from coinbase to see how it works and to gain confidence.
- Edit - I updated original post and included a link to step by step tutorial
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:39:23
The medium link loads for me, are you trying on mobile safari?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:26:00
You're welcome
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:16:35
After august 1st you can move the BTC to coinbase, but the private key should be able to generate a BCC wallet
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:53:00
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:09:25
You're welcome! Good luck
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:09:53
You're welcome, glad it helped someone!
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:49:20
If you own the generation seed you should be able to generate the BCC wallet
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:08:22
I haven't used that app specifically, but if you do some research you can find if they are a legitimate app. If they open source it is typically a good sign. There are offline wallet generators too that are safe.
Personally, I wouldn't use a mobile phone to store the keys since my phone could get lost, stolen, or broken. Everyone has their own personal preferences.
Some people use a password manager to store their keys - I personally think that is acceptable level of security, but some people are much more paranoid especially if they hold a lot of coin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:26:27
See the other comments asking same question. Yes it is if you hold the private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:00:35
Contact your exchange's support team. If you use a bank account it may take a few days.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:09:56
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:38:53
No specific reason. Just what I have used. As long as you own private keys you should be good to go
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:45:09
You are welcome
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:23:53
Only you can decide, but I would transfer.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:52:10
Ah yes, that is true. One thing you can do is request a limit increase. Not sure if it'll happen in time for Aug 1st as it took a week or so for mine to get approved, but worth a shot
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:39:40
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:19:18
Do you own your private keys?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:22:29
Yes it can drop. It can also rise. Nobody knows if you should buy more.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:20:32
If you convert them you won't have them in BTC and BCC after august 1st. Read the original post again it explains
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:52:53
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:37:23
Try installing authy on your phone?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:21:08
You are welcome
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:24:21
They have never been instant for me, usually takes a few days for bank transfer. Perhaps it can be faster with credit card?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:24:30
Check out my tutorial I linked in original post, see if it makes sense. Going thru a new wallet with blockchain app should be similar workflow. The generation seed can regenerate your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:08:58
That doesn't seem like that much - is the lightning network stuff supposed to be the ultimate solution to increasing transactions per second?
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:42:52
If you (and only you) own the private keys you should be safe.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:48:19
I'm no lawyer , but i believe only when converting to fiat. Rules might differ depending on your country 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:22:40
If you own the private keys then yes you are okay for the fork 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:13:37
Yeah it'll just take some time to show up on your GDAX account. You'll want to move the coins to a wallet you control.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:28:49
Electrum isn't a cloud service per say, it is an app that runs on your machine. If you use electrum to encrypt your wallet file (one of the steps in the post) then if someone gains access/hacks your machine they wouldn't be able to open the private key file without your password.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:23:28
Get your own wallet and private keys. It'll protect you for any future possible forks.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:25:52
You may be too late, try and transfer as soon as it comes in. You might be too late depending on when the fork actually happens
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:23:31
I don't believe coinbase allows fee customization. They also had some outages today which slowed bitcoin withdrawals. I would just go ahead and transfer the rest now so it makes it before august 1
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:54:48
Your dollars aren't affected
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:15:37
After august 1st, you can move the coins back to coinbase, but keep the private key so you can import it to a BCC wallet when they get released.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:26:20
No you aren't okay. Move from GDAX to private wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:36:10
Electrum is a wallet for BTC NOT ETH! You are confusing the two they are different currencies
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:46:34
Well it isn't necessarily free money. It depends on what both currencies do when split happens.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:35:59
Agree, but let me play devil's advocate. Imagine you are an exchange, and every day some new developer/group decides to make a new fork of BTC with their own changes. Let's say this is worth $0.00001. Should Coinbase be expected to be in legal trouble because the fork is greater than zero?
Again, not disagreeing with you - perhaps they would be in legal problems because they know ahead of time that the value is likely to be high. Maybe beyond some threshold of value they could be legally obligated. I don't know, but I CAN reason WHY they made that announcement. Perhaps they thought (since they posted the announcement before segwit) that making the statement would help dissuade forks from happening, I don't know. Regardless, best way to minimize risk is to own the private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:23:06
The post was targeting bitcoin as this is the bitcoin subreddit. If you own alt coins you probably should own the private keys too
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:39:46
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:00:24
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:22:00
Please read the original post, i have a step by step process in link
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:45:59
I edited my post and included a step by step guide
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:12:29
There shouldn't be any limit to sending BTC from coinbase. The withdrawal limit is for BTC to dollar conversions.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:09:38
Explain what?
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:50:26
Why wouldn't your dollars be safe? I'm sorry I'm confused on the question. This post is about BTC
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:38:37
Agreed they *should*, but why take the risk?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:22:14
If you followed the steps you should be in good shape. Technically you have the private key, so you should be able to regenerate the wallet. You can experiment with this if you are unsure by creating a new wallet in electum (or some other app) and importing your key
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:50:01
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:17:24
You can choose any wallet where you own the private keys
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:41:09
You should be safe. Keep that generation seed safe!!!
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:12:50
Don't know, but once you have the private keys you can download a BCC client (when it is eventually released) and restore using the same private key as your electrum wallet
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:20:54
You can download the wallet on iOS and import your 12 word phrase
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:24:38
Coinbase says in the post you just linked that coinbase won't support the new blockchain...
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:37:58
Replay attacks shouldn't be possible
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:42:28
I haven't used that, but why risk it? Move it over and you'll know you are safe
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:40:07
Very happy to hear the guide helped!
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:13:00
**Yes**. What if tomorrow someone does a fork off some other cryptocurrency that you control (with the same private keys) and then that shoots up in value? Exchanges can't support every fork from every currency.
