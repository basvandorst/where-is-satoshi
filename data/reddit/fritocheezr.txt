I checked it out but a lot of it is dated, like the bitcoin mining link which was written 5 years ago.

Satoshi Nakamoto. I saw a documentary on bitcoin in learning about it.

Do you still think its worth it to buy stocks? Back when I heard about it, I thought what an interesting idea and was thinking about buying into it, but all the financial gurus, ect said it wasnt solid so I avoided it-now obv regret. How much stocks would really be worth it?

Ill do that. I was just hoping that bitcoin users would offer some links (which they have-thanks), and things like that so I could research further. For a lot of Americans bitcoin seems really interesting and revolutionary and a lot of people want to get in on it, use it, invest in it, ect but dont exactly know how, where to get started or really what exactly it is. It seems like the ball is really getting rolling with bitcoin and is about to get more mainstream. I'd  like to buy stocks in it now before it gets really mainstream.  Is there still good money to be made in bitcoin? I mean, to me it seems like there is since bitcoin seems to only be getting started.
