Atomic Swaps/lightning network enable the cross chain transfers of currencies in addition to removing transaction data from blocks to speed up block times. Its bit confusing, and by a bit I mean super confusing. Just know it can lower the TX fee, block times/size and can enable trading BTC directly to LTC on the blockchain, without using shapeshift or an exchange. There is a lot more to it than that, but at a glance this is a general way to describe its purpose.

I think over the years he has hit over 3k bitcoin, but retiring and living on a beach at 45 has expenses... pretty awesome no matter how you spin it. He likes to send me pictures from his beach house with a sign that says wish you were here.
He is a master dickhead :)

My coworker back in 2010 told me all about bitcoin, how it would be amazing and how I should definitely buy like 100 dollars worth. I did not - He did, and continued to buy bitcoin randomly all that year.
Today he holds over 900 BTC because he was a true believer - still is - and has since retired to a beach house in Florida. Whn he left, I got promoted into his spot and still work there, typing this from his old desk now...
I bough 20 dollars worth of bitcoin and sold it when it was around 100 dollars. Paid off a car, but now that car is breaking down and bitcoin is worth 7k. FML.
