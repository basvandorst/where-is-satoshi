Its an interesting and novel approach actually. 
I’m curious how your results look assuming you ran this analysis 3 or 6 months ago and how that back tested forecast looks against where the price is today.

Yes. So why not do the same for older data? Try matching the July 2018 - December 2018 data and then get a prediction for where it should be in right now.

This. 
Realise the world operates the way it does whether you like it or not. Crypto is no different to other aspects of life - idiots also drive so be defensive, don’t wear flashy jewellery in a ghetto, cross to the other side of the street if you see a group at night, don’t pick up the soap if you drop it.

I think we’ll get to a stage where key collision discovery will be possible on old legacy wallets. 
Just a question of when. There is a lot of time between now and 2140. 
Active wallets will migrate to something more secure but the old lost account will become accessible.

I think the solution you’re looking for is how to earn money.
THEN start wondering about converting that to crypto. 
Your chances of finding work earning money are much greater than work earning crypto directly.
