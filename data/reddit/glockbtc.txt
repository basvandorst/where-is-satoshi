I recommend u/bitcoin_forever
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:30:33
He founded xapo. Just being sarcastic y'all
@_date: 2016-08-17 03:49:44
That's a transaction to many people, one is yours
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:10:51
Ok works now
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:19:05
If it's not bitcoin it's a scam
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:59:27
Against all other coins usually called shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-13 06:25:19


Damn son
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:25:20
None use debit at circle
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:17:53
These btc guys don't actually want bitcoin to get better
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:04:45
Every contest has no purchase necessary and an alternate method of entry.
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:23:43
Yes but sure they're servers
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:18:35
These btc guys don't actually want bitcoin to get better
@_date: 2016-08-16 11:35:24
They usually don't reply
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:47:46
Find an exchange
@_date: 2016-08-26 04:04:34
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:42:28
You're also an obvious troll
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:38:35
Looks like you can hang it like a mini split heater
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:14:10
Not classy
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:09:21
Ok thanks 
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:42:13
Works for me @ 208.64.123.130
But they seem to be also using CloudFlare at 104.27.175.154 104.27.174.154
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:43:27
This kind of business pays 10%+
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:59:57
7 days! Legit! 
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:29:01
You Russian! 
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:35:16
Stick to circle
@_date: 2016-08-22 20:38:41
It's illegal to have a closed sweepstakes
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:57:25
I thought they were sold
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:34:22
If you use fiat mode you can withdraw
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:25:46
Very nice
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:05:45
Bfx will probably pay you 10K BTC so do it and go retire far away
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:56:43
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:09:14
Only put back wallet.dat
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:48:05
True I use copay but I trust mycelium more
@_date: 2016-08-27 17:17:16
Salt the earth! 
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:26:34
Ftdi still works but you fried the micro controller

Vultr has cheap large storage
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:51:40
Many left the bitcoin scam to paycoin and Amazon accepts it now and it's worth $20
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:50:23
Onecoin has no coin, it's all a spreadsheet, very innovative
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:50:13
I think the name changed
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:23:07
Yes the hashes validate and build on each other, read merkle trees
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:29:08
Ok thanks
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:25:36
Prediction but that's all exchanges
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:05:32
I'll pay 50%
@_date: 2016-08-16 11:37:18
It's not really safe with rdp unless you sign offline
@_date: 2016-08-29 07:05:59
The new version gives you a seed and it's all you need
@_date: 2016-08-26 19:41:06
Your only option left is Gemini, glidera and libertyx for market rates
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:41:45
Cryptome.org seems to be bidding
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:39:06
True he's actually pretty good. But is he smart enough to have a hideout ready for when things hit the fan or does he really believe it? 
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:42:16
Why do you need it to confirm quickly? They will confirm at some point
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:12:40
They never got permission (shame on Starbucks not them) so they always had to hack together the service and things break or get blocked
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:07:04
Maybe hour
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:29:22
Ok hurry, these shitcoin fud us every day and it takes a toll on us. Could you at least make a thread like this weekly? 
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:23:34
Miners also have different policies so a different one may get a block and include yours
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:12:43
Lol how long did it the you to download their logo then upload it
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:22:16
The transaction was huge congrats
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:18:34
Bfx really needs to make a public reward of 10k btc
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:42:21
Bitcoin isn't viable! Get in on paycoin, ethereum and onecoin lol
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:15:26
Pawn shop has kyc
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:24:20
A threat is someone dumping that many and crashing the price
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:34:48
Let them burn with eth
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:32:47
It's just a temporary pump and dump, it won't get to that
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:36:46
I ordered. How long does it take to ship
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:01:35
Maybe you should expand
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:47:31
At least they're keeping the price high and haircut is only 21%
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:07:47
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:18:21
Fee is about 20% so $24
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:16:59
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:56:11
They're 5¢ and he's casually mentioning $50
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:34:44
I guess you're right about the irc is the server
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:47:12
Download copay, back up then forget about it for a couple years. Then delete this account and all online accounts and disappear. And don't invest in anything
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:08:32
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:41:38
Take a nap brother, it's only been 2 hours
@_date: 2016-08-31 14:21:40
Of course it's a scam
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:36:59
Yes bitfinex but they just lost $60 million
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:49:29
Almost all
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:23:18
I'm guessing phishing
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:11:32
Newegg, torguard, fasttech, fiverr, Reddit
@_date: 2016-08-26 04:03:47
Are you getting connections? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:16:41
Join joinmarket for more liquidity and privacy
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:46:01
Do you sell any type of credit card reader? I highly doubt there's no reason though it may be stupid
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:26:42
They also ban payments outside
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:08:55
That's it, bitcoin is freedom
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:30:19
Geez he's gone full retard
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:47:55
Actually the ssl key holder can quickly create proofs and cash in
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:01:12
If you didn't have the private keys then no. Use wallets like copay where you get the private keys
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:40:21
It's a fraud
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:36:18
You don't need two hardware wallets, you create a paper backup
@_date: 2016-08-13 06:24:48
This is state
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:59:18
You could email Bitpay but I doubt they'd leave the page up
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:45:26
I'd dump all fiat
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:29:31
They also shutdown their Reddit, good thing they have to listen here
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:17:06
I sold my gold for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:08:02
Apple wants 30%
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:14:30
Making up
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:17:47
Yes the theft barely affected price, very resilient after the halvening
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:54:03
Dead on
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:02:37
So litecoin? Oh wait it's dead
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:12:37
2 months©
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:46:38
Op is probably talking seeding
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:11:14
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:57:56
@_date: 2016-08-29 07:08:11
Amount doesn't matter
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:22:08
It may work if you use a burner account and buy quickly
@_date: 2016-08-28 19:50:55
Idk they're owned by China now
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:40:17
Ok I'm using copay and mycelium
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:01:36
I don't see the point
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:30:35
They get ver off
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:33:54
Yes email yourself a private key
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:46:14
Do you have cat combs? You could sell many on Reddit
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:27:39
If you want to pretend, buy a hair dryer and leave it on. You'll get the same bitcoin, heat, noise and electric bill. It's also much much cheaper and zero config.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:22:04
Paste it into notepad, it's probably a uri
@_date: 2016-08-17 02:39:47
Nah they're ok
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:33:02
That's not the right place
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:35:59
Shit title
@_date: 2016-08-21 17:21:42
@_date: 2016-08-27 10:05:28
Forget it
@_date: 2016-08-15 08:54:13
I'm ready! 
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:57:52
Mycelium is good too
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:40:50
LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:33:02
Amazing! Like paycoin but not a fraud! 
@_date: 2016-08-18 01:16:35
To start another
@_date: 2016-08-14 05:05:07
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:47:36
More like helping them accept bitcoin donations
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:25:34
Copay, it's multi platform, it's nice having it on my laptop too. Mycelium requires less setup though
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:05:41
Looks like nothing
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:46:54
It's actually the opposite
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:14:23
Fee is ok for a couple hours so wait. Actually the size is pretty big but it should get mined tonight
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:23:15
Greed and fear of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:32:46
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:44:10
Complete scam that copies mmm
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:04:45
Use circle, they don't shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:06:26
Use copay, and if you need to buy use circle
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:14:25
Good job
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:53:26
Ok thanks
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:01:27
Shitcoin wallets like jaxx aren't trusted
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:54:13
Then it's time for bigger blocks
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:49:52
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:25:35
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:39:05
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:50:45
I'll sue your ass
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:39:20
They're innovating
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:16:50
Go buy a lottery ticket and a cat
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:25:08
Spark business, you can be an individual
@_date: 2016-08-27 09:48:56
Looks legit, it's a war on fiat
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:22:47
And they'll blame bitcoin somehow
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:54:06
That's why I say shame on Starbucks, have you tried asking tango? Or 
Tango seems to like bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-08-27 09:55:41
What happened to it
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:57:09
You can also try sending a new one directly to pools who were quicker to drop it. I think eligius has a form
@_date: 2016-08-23 12:34:35
Closed sweepstakes are illegal
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:59:48
Debit card and circle
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:02:56
Those are extensions afaik
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:59:46
We don't go to places like that! 
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:15:38
That's actually much better than I thought
@_date: 2016-08-27 20:54:46
The whole wallet is compromised
@_date: 2016-08-20 05:21:53
Salts should never be reused
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:18:10
Yes still better than gox, that's another 30%*36.6%! So haircut could be only 25% for some
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:25:40
Maybe blockchain.info
@_date: 2016-08-22 07:10:43
Yeah the pump includes specific markets which are also in on it with exit scams
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:18:32
Keep yelling at them they might
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:35:24
You're just watching it more ��
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:59:33
They fuck us then wonder why we pirate
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:50:21
Pretty cool Luke
@_date: 2016-08-14 07:38:35
 works
 there were complaints of bitcoincore.org before
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:19:39
Only limited by 64 bits! 
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:23:29
No there are no actual coins
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:20:07
Why exactly do you need confirmations so quick? 
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:22:20
Really cool
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:49:29
Says the eth shill
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:46:37
We don't care
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:17:35
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:28:02
They can avoid civil asset forfeiture
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:16:42
Haha he'll wish he had a bitcoin prenup
@_date: 2016-08-31 14:29:20
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:07:36
Ok and they also need a post mortem! 
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:55:24
Get lost
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:23:13
But you couldn't buy then either
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:52:59
Congrats! Many rich guys try to get the attention of gonewild girls and you did it! Be sure to invite us to the wedding.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:19:02
Exactly, oh ltc is silver, oh eth is faster, they're shit. The moment you choose one you choose them all, because there will always be "faster" or "innovative" and you invest against yourself
@_date: 2016-08-15 08:58:29
Anyone try it? 
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:06:51
Make a new wallet
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:49:02
Better than paycoin I guess
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:40:42
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:34:40
No this isn't onecoin
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:23:36
Circle or libertyx
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:41:55
I like Bruce wanker better
@_date: 2016-08-21 12:56:20
Scroll down 
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:22:26
So copay can't use chrome apps? I bet their code can easily run on Firefox like mysms uses. Chromium should still work though
@_date: 2016-08-27 22:37:41
What country
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:24:23
It's really unbelievable, guess the walled garden is only for when Apple is losing money not innocent victims
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:15:10
Breathe buddy
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:46:56
I doubt they want to be a shitcoin wallet
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:11:30
Looks like pow is also changed so no
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:30:53
Putin got him
@_date: 2016-08-28 19:41:32
That's pretty secure especially the new ones with nougat 
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:26:53
I don't have enough
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:53:10
Copay or mycelium
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:51:32
Yes but we wait for Matt
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:02:33
send a bit and check around
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:24:33
The fees are, coinbase reward is temporary and used for distribution
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:07:22
What battery do you use
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:53:38
Wait for Monday
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:01:02
When it doubles with the price and activity
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:48:06
No you need a paper backup
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:26:58
You can use coinapult site too
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:39:36
Even better
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:15:20
And get his bct account hacked and trick ppl into sending 1btc to him
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:33:21
Copay deserves some profit
@_date: 2016-08-29 05:49:35
May they lose their yachts
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:14:26
Please grammar is critical
@_date: 2016-08-27 10:04:07
Why? Wait to ship or revoke digital
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:02:14
Piper wallet. I like my entropy tho
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:44:49
Everyone in ethereum seems to have thrown ethics out the window, both moral and blockchain ethics
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:55:28
Lol eth fork
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:41:30
Clear your dns
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:24:48
Wow 42%! Some people can get most of their money back, haircut down to 21%
@_date: 2016-08-17 02:18:42
No he's trying to be cool
@_date: 2016-08-16 03:00:08
there's a difference between not being happy, we aren't happy either, vs shitting on something no matter what then casually pumping shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:29:47
I wish to find someone 100% wrong but not possible!!!
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:16:54
Rich guy pretends to be bfx hacker, runs a lottery to woo cam girl, gives her $600k then asks her to marry him
@_date: 2016-08-15 03:24:05
No you lose 1%
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:47:48
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:06:22
Exactly, the question is whether there's more or they blew their load on the freebies
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:48:51
No stop talking to these ppl, your coins will get stolen. Take your coins and disappear. Don't give anyone anything.
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:48:07
Teller has it, bitcoin can't be rejected

@_date: 2016-08-22 15:41:08
That's the place that pumps startcoin
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:16:57
You can send even before confirmation
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:44:21
Yes a huge market
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:01:10
Depends on how much you trust tether, etc
@_date: 2016-08-27 20:55:25
You can try
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:08:54
You're spending €500??
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:38:17
Idiots didn't learn a thing from paycoin
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:12:45
Maybe their meter should be calibrated
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:54:25
Wire to bitstamp
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:55:53
Hahaha intranet
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:54:49

A movie
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:00:19
I wonder why
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:30:29
Maybe old billionaire wants to be crypto hip and got obsessed with her so he does a fantasy. His coins are definitely not bfx tho
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:26:52
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:42:23
Lol  like they didn't know about it
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:36:28
Yes exactly they're not your coins
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:36:33
My math says 25%
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:48:03
Counterwallet hasn't worked in a month now
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:43:38
Spill it
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:41:50
Seaman is a retarded loser and massive eth bagholder/shill
@_date: 2016-08-16 08:42:43
The app would have to keep running vs joinmarket dedicated servers
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:35:19
Hope that coward Armstrong is dumped
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:55:22
They shitcoin and shill now
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:28:32
They can't, mixers will be banned at some point, use joinmarket
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:46:37
Good deal
@_date: 2016-08-15 06:54:24
I'm really curious where he got knots from
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:32:38
I believe the bitcoin blockchain will win and hopefully ver went full eth and he'll lose everything
@_date: 2016-08-29 05:47:27
I just got another gun I'm ready
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:46:06
You just have to upload more than you download, so that depends on your speed. 75% is great ��
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:10:55
Why not
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:50:59
If it's not bitcoin it's a scam
@_date: 2016-08-25 16:28:02
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:04:51
Cool your niche of refunds is unique
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:34:22
Fuck off with your $50 you concern troll aka bank shill
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:44:15
30¢ now
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:11:52
Yeah still better than gox, that's another 30%*36.6%! So haircut could be only 25% for some
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:38:51
Sleep on it
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:02:19
I'm pretty sure they meant bfx accepts tether, ask polo since they do too
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:27:18
Yes you would own the keys
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:56:25
@_date: 2016-08-21 01:18:02
True but if Starbucks gives you wholesale cards and api
@_date: 2016-08-15 08:55:32
How were they delivered
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:23:14
Yeah the Chinese use a special version of everything and most users probably get the binary from a forum where the attack is happening. This doesn't help them
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:46:56
What? Bitpay is amazing
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:28:56
No USA of course
@_date: 2016-08-15 08:59:05
What's the performance? 
@_date: 2016-08-11 21:12:59
They're good but you should use a real wallet
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:20:37
Mining is a scam, just buy
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:06:45
@_date: 2016-08-22 07:11:02
But they're hyping specific ones which adds risk
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:07:43
People who use it give bfx value so you should be supported
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:20:01

Baptists don't drink
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:53:02
I appreciate your work
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:16:30
No it's probably Chinese firewall and computers with a hidden Chinese ca but cobra refuses to say
@_date: 2016-08-27 09:48:09
Haha when the gox still existed
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:04:50
In citrus heights? 
@_date: 2016-08-29 08:52:25
Maybe they have fees? 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:08:52
People were suicidal last week, I'm just glad they got a lot back
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:20:01
Lulz I kept trying to clean dust off my phone
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:11:50
Verify what
@_date: 2016-08-26 18:39:37
It's simple
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:18:41
At 30¢ still better than gox, that's another 30%*36.6%! So haircut could be only 25% for some
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:13:25
How'd you lose dns? 
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:22:05
Yeah they basically pocketed it all then called it a scam to cover it up
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:27:52
Fork is better
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:12:49
A proprietary app to pay at each store is not viable
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:59:05
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:47:54
Not a scam, more like donation. Wait and see maybe you'll make something but checking this year won't help you
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:21:09
Good she needs it but she'll blow it sadly
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:27:08
Maybe a week sometimes but worth it
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:33:27
That's for the supposed more
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:26:23
Yes he's letting ppl who are pretending to fix bitcoin spread fud
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:43:29
I want to experience it
@_date: 2016-08-15 03:57:18
Ver does anything he can to hurt bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:10:09
No those are shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:44:51
How can they prove they didn't have more? 
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:21:32
Virtual machines are fun and free
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:59:30
No they pay it for you
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:24:03
What's a good site and charger? 
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:34:18
Sure it does when athletes lie
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:44:16
What country? 
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:50:48
No he only cares about himself, karma will get him
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:47:22
They say not to get it directly from one developer on that url and get the one signed by all of them
@_date: 2016-08-27 10:06:36
No ��
@_date: 2016-08-26 08:09:39
That's spv
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:47:12
Yes this is more of a donation
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:03:48
Why mention ledger now? When you could've used them before the hacks? 
@_date: 2016-08-27 10:06:08
Quick eyeball 1/1000? Not bad

@_date: 2016-08-11 18:25:36
Yes there's a few video leaks on YouTube where he laughs
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:16:39
Finally a respectable news source
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:18:23
Putin already killed his opponents
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:37:20
Why are ppl buying them
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:50:18
It's many things to many people

@_date: 2016-08-16 23:52:32
Lulz even paycoin did better
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:42:22
Looks down 
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:19:21
Everything is better than eth shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-27 04:43:50
There are several initiates we are investigating to make this possible.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:19:27
Looks good
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:29:47
You troll. This is the peak and new solutions are getting close. Did the sec reply to you, you shill? 
@_date: 2016-08-27 17:08:01
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:03:53
That's pretty innovative
@_date: 2016-08-18 01:14:22
So the owner pretended not to know you and called the cops? 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:11:00
Bfxcoin is going to 10¢ 
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:13:59
Got mine You received 0.05966791 BTC
@_date: 2016-08-14 07:43:15
You're being manned, maybe you're in a captive portal. Why don't you share the cert you're getting? What's the subject, fingerprint and date
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:13:09
Could you find those emails but don't publish anything yet
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:10:16
Yeah ver thinks those people actually like bitcoin when they're obviously alt and bank shills
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:11:10
Works now but it hasn't worked for a month
@_date: 2016-08-29 05:55:26
Not on digital ocean or vultr 
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:55:02
Never! 
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:05:03
It's kinda like everyone signing messages that they prove they own some then the network randomly chooses a winner
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:37:31
You still haven't found the % key? Copy this %
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:36:50
He said do it anyway
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:54:52
Only at hashing
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:25:09
Tell ethf
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:22:14
Sad that you can't even dump and exit since the coins don't even exist
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:27:33
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:08:29
You spent $300 k? 
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:25:34
Yeah so much wasted time, effort and money
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:44:07
Change addresses are automatic
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:04:45
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:10:07
You can't edit the history, for example a timestamp or balance. Ethereum did edit and they're no longer a real blockchain. Bitcoin is an immutable blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:20:31
Cobra owns the domain like ver owns bitcoin.com
@_date: 2016-08-29 04:35:34
The nexus are signed and nougat is using hardware encryption
@_date: 2016-08-13 06:22:54

@_date: 2017-02-20 09:19:44
Well what wallet are you using, most do it automatically. Yes you pay miners a small fee to mine your tx
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:53:34
Who won
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:23:57

@_date: 2017-02-19 19:02:04
Yeah cash is already mostly digital
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:36:39
Lol those are shitcoin, what idiot emailed you? 
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:38:00
Trumps only goal is to crash the economy so he can buy cheap real estate
@_date: 2017-02-01 13:04:25
It's called Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:33:06
How'd you get that much
@_date: 2017-02-01 13:03:39
You used the ultrasound machine? 
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:34:53
Idk there's penny stock scams every month
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:04:47

@_date: 2017-02-03 05:12:57

It's l337 tho
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:42:39
Yeah that opening his eyes is obvious shilling and they ate it up
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:11:46
Is anything new? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:54:29
How'd you send it? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:06:09
It's a bluff but never use your name on the internet
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:21:35
No Bitcoin doesn't use sha1
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:57:15
Suck it gyna
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:01:48
Fucking scum laughing about stealing from people
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:40:04

@_date: 2017-02-22 21:29:02
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:08:01
He's a hero, an asset you need to keep
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:28:34
Fine I'll forgive if we get approved and change my review
@_date: 2017-02-26 03:41:38

That's a lot of typing when I just want a summary, not happy
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:48:23
There's no morals there

@_date: 2017-02-23 15:20:39
Look at the stock market
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:35:45
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:14:30
Is this the euphoric guy? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:48:25
There's going to be a massive stock market crash
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:31:34

They'd be foaming at the mouth if ver invented segwit and core was doing a destructive hard fork

Liberals are usually smarter as are libertarians. We're a mix of both here and trump is an imbecile. You're not a minority here. Conservatives are different and not very bright.
Any libertarian that likes trump is also an imbecile, see 
Trump supports violent state robbery. Trump will also destroy the economy but as bitcoiners we'll benefit
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:25:22
Yeah good thing he can only sell them once and we don't have pos ponzi. The guy wants power tho hence he founded zcash and dreams it succeeds. Maybe his simple mind will learn that a controlled coin isn't good
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:33:56
Lol no

@_date: 2017-02-23 14:38:40
Can be, not a used bug
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:42:10
It isn't, it switches Bitcoin to physical security which humans are familiar with
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:38:59
What about outbound
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:11:38
No that was fake and now fixed

He'll probably fake cry again
@_date: 2017-02-18 09:32:48
Why didn't he tell you at that point
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:17:30
I think they're going to refund the cash
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:43:07
Btc could crash or rocket next week
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:03:30
Then they're hiding today because it was written 3 hours ago
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:44:27
That's lead right? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:26:09

@_date: 2017-03-10 18:57:47
Yes joinmarket
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:56:08
Very shady
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:14:12
Those don't actually hold Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-20 09:40:56
Coinbase can be seized and frozen, they're not yours
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:04:21
Gabi buying back in
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:51:03
Should be fine
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:02:31
Yeah that's not Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:44:54
No scams
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:11:03
Yes that's it's main value
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:51:52
Which winkle were you closer with
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:12:42
They go down a bit. There is no off chain
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:40:50
Be grateful it's not income
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:47:07
Go into a real wallet first
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:57:34
Very easy, income tax, reset your basis, capital gains
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:32:56
They have a usd wallet also try Gemini
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:36:33
Yes call silbert
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:18:48
Those fucks trade anything
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:06:36
Get this patriot a coat! 
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:47:13
You can use all their computers and not make a dent
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:13:39
Not in fiat
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:15:04
Yup see 
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:59:37
Ver openly buys retweets, of course he's hiring people to troll here
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:57:56
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:34:04
Fake news
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:06:06
Maybe they can't announce yet
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:47:30
You may want to sell some in case
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:31:05
Not a scam
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:11:16
They're doing this enteth which uses the code but not the coins, it's a separate blockchain so the coins you buy won't even be used
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:48:08
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:53:39
Whatever this cast thing is, today is the most viewers they've ever had
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:34:31
Because they may hold one coin as you'll have two. Many exchanges stole etc when ethf forked
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:06:26
Suck it
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:41:15
Then you got ethered
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:13:24
No a limit guarantees a price but stays open. What do you want to do exactly?  Moc won't stay open waiting for 1200, limit will
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:30:30
I fully agree in principle, you'll just lose your money mining or cloud mining, I wish we could
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:13:13
Yeah it's violent
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:16:38
The government takes your property at gun point with no arrest, like a robbery
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:32:33
It used to say founder
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:43:44
Good guy mow
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:20:29
They scared
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:13:34
Bofa is good surprisingly, or get an account at the business cap1 spark. Usaa but you can't get in
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:59:48
It's a scam with 100 million coins and growing vs Bitcoin limited supply
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:47:47
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:34:13
Oh ok
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:57:30
That's fine
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:07:46

@_date: 2017-02-23 15:42:30
Just keep your panties out of a twist
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:31:48
Probably someone close to you. Has anyone taken a photo of you recently out of the blue? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:51:49
Finally stupid ver
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:30:06
Ver is also a founder of zcash
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:12:48
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:36:02
Yup he's very close
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:36:01
Say that when your etherium dumps
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:49:44
Haha no
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:11:48
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:35:04
I want salami and crackers
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:28:51
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:50:47
Cloud mining is a scam
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:38:11
Your intermediate certs are missing or my browser doesn't trust startcom or I think you're sending 2 certificates 
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:06:29
Yeah we've been leading for a month now very good, we used to follow very badly
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:02:43
Please fix your ssl
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:00:06
If it reconciles it's Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:04:03
Good to hear
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:26:54
Sendgrid is better
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:52:50
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:44:27
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:49:39
Sounds like all or nothing, Gemini doesn't seem to have maker discounts, why not just use a limit? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:57:31
Shady of them
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:20:50
Lol with all this anti regulation, kill the sec too. The heads of epa, hud and education were selected to end their agencies, why not sec??
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:23:25
Depends if you can stomach it
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:47:45
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:49:25

@_date: 2017-03-05 07:04:21
Yeah there's a creep called jstolfi that's obsessed
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:23:47
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:34:11
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:11:52
No because cap is supply  x price, 300 million would probably add a billion or 2 or more even. 300m *can* double the price and therefore double the market cap
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:10:56
Zip it back up guys
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:29:07
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:14:40
No! I'm shorting eth there right now
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:08:21
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:39:15
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:21:40
They do, some contract with exchanges for a guaranteed rate, gox used to contract eligius
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:02:33

@_date: 2017-03-15 11:12:08
You can follow ssh tunnel tutorials, then you can forward the port and use it as if it was local.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:50:51

@_date: 2017-03-02 04:50:46
You can't be mining anymore unless your electricity is free? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:23:38
Wasn't he scamming with Craig Wright
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:10:49
We already have fiat
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:02:16
Who got that low?  I only saw 1230
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:48:32
Always respectable
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:25:04
Shitcoin like ethereum or cloud mining where they supposedly mine Bitcoin for you
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:31:38
When? Last time he hated it
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:03:35
Their values are the opposite of ours, there's no comparison
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:49:56
Yeah it would be killer
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:22:51
Of course, a custom domain
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:53:54
More usage
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:30:03
Hey we put this "hygiene" money into Bitcoin. The only thing I buy are guns and Bitcoin. No soap.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:09:33
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:29:18
Sad! 
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:25:13
Wow they're getting desperate

Not really true, bu has less support than segwit right now. We'll keep like 75%
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:16:46
Sometimes, other times ethf dumps
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:32:14
Fees drop
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:05:40
Not very many are actually for sale, and price climbs as you increase volume and climb up the asks
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:14:58

@_date: 2017-03-13 17:26:51

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:17:27
No it's not delusional clown
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:29:10
Yes you can have money can't you? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:17:00
This guy went nuts over the past year, what happened
@_date: 2017-03-06 08:27:33
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:46:01
No the network is designed to protect from them
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:36:10
Wait for it
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:20:07
I mean email
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:05:31
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:59:06
There's some really nice letters 
Then there's professor bitcorn 
And piece of shit jstolfi 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:46:31
It didn't compromise it, it only made the idiots running it lose money
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:31:15
They really need charting
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:28:27
Buy weekly
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:50:34
Sad! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:06:50
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:58:10
Ver is pathological
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:55:23
To the floor! 
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:03:44
Good riddance
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:46:06
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:18:44
Manicure here
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:09:18
They approve penny stocks
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:14:03
Write a novel about it then
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:29:42
I can't wait for the next crash, Bitcoin will be the only thing up
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:32:04
We'll get there
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:02:47
Yeah but those shitcoin aren't going to hold value, you'll lose more than taxes
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:04:15
having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:53:42
Shitcoin always dump
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:24:02
No that's old school
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:06:11
Lol with all this anti regulation, kill the sec too. The heads of epa, hud and education were selected to end their agencies, why not sec??
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:48:16
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:36:03
Lucky bastards already got some sweetness 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:20:15
Good job, don't fall for cloud mining or shitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:51:17
I add it then I have to readd it daily
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:36:07
Ok I thought the foil was lead
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:43
Still erect
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:59:01
Ver attacks Bitcoin whenever he can
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:32:14
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:03:56
Not sure what would affect it then
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:49:19
You'll be bouji
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:27:14
Just did
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:21:03
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:51:55
It's centralized but I think you can still lose it
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:11:00
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:02:06
Yes they get pissed when Bitcoin goes up
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:38:24
Use a real exchange like Gemini and you get 99%
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:17:43
Yeah sometimes the death penalty is called for
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:56:27
Ver followers aren't bright people
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:27:25
Good price up
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:01:12
A week probably

He's Bitcoin Judas
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:43:32
Etherium is a scam with fake hype
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:08:47
He does excellent work
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:06:25
Exemplary post

Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:16:01
It might have been sent already
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:04:21
People are throwing in all their life savings, this isn't going to end well
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:58:00
Ver supports this
A block recently had 1.8 btc in fees, ver is paying him to mine empty blocks yet wants bigger blocks, his only goal is to attack bitcoin then he shills shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:33:01
Cutie patooty
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:22:54
Even better! 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:58:57
It's been obvious for a while, they all shill shitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:18:27
No those are taxable
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:00:18
Very charming
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:17:06
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:57:14
Always respected this guy, it was weird seeing him there
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:03:27
A block recently had 1.8 btc in fees it's fine
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:46:28
Idiots could've used this to get authority yet they let it pass
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:14:53
Good job
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:09:02
I'd take money from ver then switch so don't discount that

Yes fully recoverable

Oh look shitcoin pump and dump
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:09:50
Looks confirmed
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:07:49
I see it confirmed
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:56:54
Good guy Chad

@_date: 2017-03-08 16:29:52
Yeah that flash will drop dead
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:42:31
At 50% it's only double, not that bad
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:21:52
I doubt it

Insider trading
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:02:50
See Bitcoin Judas

@_date: 2017-03-12 16:36:17
I never sell

How would you fund the limit buy
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:32:55
please quit
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:04:36
It's not a wallet bro, use copay

There's many scams, there's no free money
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:44:28
This is cheap
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:16:08
Ver is paying/bribing some
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:35:23
They're all scams
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:49:41
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:52:44
Or use square cash
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:41:24
Ico = scam
@_date: 2017-01-14 07:30:21
Wow! 
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:05:49
They lie

Buddy, Circle® is so good I install fresh! I got all my friends and mom hooked on Circle®. Circle© is easy peasy lemon squeezy.

Gyna got caught
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:53:08
I'm glad I'm impulsive because I went all in, fuk it
But I did it at $700 in 2014 unfortunately
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:28:08
$100,000,000 Satoshi =$1
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:27:56
Already did
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:59:43
Difficulty doesn't create transactions
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:25:57
When they're wrong they change the date
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:09:58
Haha they're obvious
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:43:48
I think you're allowed to have investments and capital gains, it's not income, though that's ssdi not ssi. Why aren't you on ssdi? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:04:01
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:19:09
Costume? 
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:37:08
Maybe proxies
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:04:30
Lol didn't get enough bulbs
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:48:21
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:35:24
Sure they've escrowed goats before
@_date: 2017-01-14 00:25:37
I hope they're not in Coinbase still
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:49:44
I think he'll do catastrophic things which will be good for us
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:31:20
There's professor bitcorn and jorge stolfi, anti Bitcoin losers. You can Google easily
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:37:05
Why not
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:37:12
It'll expire and come back to you
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:01:00
Sure bud, ethtards don't care or use the token, they fork if butterin says so they can continue their pump and dump
@_date: 2017-01-18 10:23:22
It's ready  until miners activate it
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:57:19
Thanks I saw yours but was worried it'd be bright at night 
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:16:14
You're not very bright
@_date: 2017-01-20 09:37:17
What? No it'll be seen as a hedge better than gold
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:20:34
He had a massive break down mentally, like worse than kanye
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:54:12
They removed Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:31:15
You won't lose it
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:33:04
The lawyers keep delaying until it's all gone
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:52:22
Yes just send
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:17:42
No he sent $15 into the past
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:11:46
They have our private information for one
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:24:35
Grass was too long then I guess he shot a bow and arrow at police
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:10:14
No we'd call it spam
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:34:49
They want to be a dapp and dao themself
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:27:33
And it's back
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:42:43
Yes you can't lose Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:51:51
Bitcoin is fAKE! JusT look at obamama bith certificate at comic pizza. 
mountain gox proved that the block chin is inherently unsafe and corruptable, like hillarey.
only trust money printed by obama and special drawing rights ala legrande. is he going to jail?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:20:55
Very easy 
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:06:43
You'd have to use the public master key in JavaScript which is ok but you can never leak a private key
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:54:28
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:42:56
They like to show off
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:02:11
Lol the coins don't even exist
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:14:01
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:28:39
Oh that he's accepting of others. I'm Catholic too Luke but I agree with that pope. Not sure how Christians can claim to be Christian then wish hell to gays and other religions. If they're going to hell that's Gods decision, until then you respect them. Disrespecting the pope is blasphemous too.
You can't declare whatever religion India is that a whole continent is going to hell. It's not their fault they didn't grow up Catholic. Jesus is about love and respect, not grouping people into going to hell. You think the Christian crusaders went to heaven for murder? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:59:29
Watch YouTube
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:43:18
Because Bitcoin is money
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:09:02
Yes and it's absurdly expensive, I accidentally used their cdn once and got a    $1,000 bill
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:57:23
You have to hold longer than a day, we're going up again
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:26:04
No I got my mom hooked on Circle®
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:44:23
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:26:44
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:48:10
They removed Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:57:14
Yes and there's a spread between
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:20:26
Until they find a way to profit, I'm sure politicians are selling fake exchange certificates to allow exchanges to be "official"
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:30:31
Probably nothing
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:45:44
Dao mining
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:58:00
Is the ceo missing
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:46:02
No that's how you die
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:24:13
There's stuff here 
But a problem would be the iterator, where would you store the index
I suggest using a php script to write via JavaScript.. You can run it outside wordpress
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:53:46
Over 8 is ok, it takes time to spread your ip
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:44:37
That's a big dinner
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:07:10
It'll overheat but if it's cold you can probably leave it on its side with the fan up, but it'll be slow, you really need a gpu
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:01:49
Education yes. I'm sure they use the lottery tho which helps with education expenses. Most medical is in Mexican clinics tho where they pay cash usually
@_date: 2017-01-01 06:15:44
Tove Lo is even worse
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:53:58
No you get capital gains rates
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:17:59
No sorry
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:39:15
Usa opens tomorrow
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:27:01
You never sell
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:08:04
And we were mad at gox
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:46:55
Wrong they fork anytime and will go pos, read more and don't be gullible
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:43:26
Fine I'll support this enemy, better than cowards like ver and vitally
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:24:58
Also technically leds hate heat and won't last an hour and solar panels stop working in too much heat, just put plants in the sun lol
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:44:45
Maybe he'll add it
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:41:38
No way to vanity gen that right? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:28:45
He's blasphemous scum
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:43:44
@_date: 2017-01-20 09:37:30
Shitstorm starts today! 
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:51:16

Well his photos are fake
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:28:32
That bitch hearn
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:29:13
He's growing though, he now has many shill accounts he hired
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:48:29
You don't lose Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:05:12
Exactly here 
Supload won't be here very long anyway, they're using aws and will soon get a $100,000+ bill from Amazon
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:32:22
We've already culled since gox, this is the recovery
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:29:30
Well millennials are hitting 30s now
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:06:29
You can do the same with new addresses with a real wallet
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:49:39
That's why you must hold
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:35:07
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:55:55
When did he learn English
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:02:21
Not backing it up is a good thing for security
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:54:39
Pretty much that loser will accidentally turn them into etherium
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:45:13
It goes on your personal return
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:27:45
As onecoin would say, ghaneesis
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:19:05

It does, most is heat but you might go deaf
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:55:30
Does it happen immediately? Mine does that after a few hours
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:36:16
Maybe but they sure as hell hurt Bitcoin for their own benefit
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:42:12
The seed may need translation but contains your private keys regardless
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:49:28
Every time I buy a new Apple iPhone® Circle is the first app I install! 
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:05:01
Don't want their electricity turned off
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:26:34
Those are scams
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:07:38
You're right they count assets, well you're spending money, when you sell Bitcoin use a family member
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:00:38
There's people blocking segwit, blame them
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:56:03

Vultr has cheaper large storage 
Yah I'd use a hosted solution
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:47:04
$1250! We should release the private sector to buy
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:46:45
Well last time it was sponsored by paycoin so they don't care about anything
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:42:32
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:25:18
Yes it'll get better, nodes that connect share your node with others
@_date: 2017-01-26 12:14:58
Yes every company in the foundation turned out to be a scam, gox, bfl, knc, shrem, etc
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:21:03
It's been tried, won't happen
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:42:38
Fake blockchain love and work for a bank

That tax is very cheap if not free for $37,000
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:47:38
He's invested in shitcoin and wants to hurt Bitcoin, he's a founder of zcash
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:43:15
That's what he wants you to think
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:09:50

I read disturbing
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:02:31
Look now
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:50:48
Warnings should be used immediately
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:46:57
There's multiple exchanges
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:16:17
Try Gemini too it's cheaper
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:59:21
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:43:39
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:56:10
I use it often on Reddit, new egg, fiverr, etc
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:49:32
He sent it back to buy Bitcoin cheaper
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:39:37
It's fine if you must
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:43:17
Capital gains are cheap vs vat etc
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:14:38
Sure it's good for us, but if we have Americans picking fruit they won't afford any groceries with any job
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:43:11
He's quiet because his business requires pumping shitcoin but he feels guilty
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:44:08
Sad! 
@_date: 2017-01-12 08:16:43
Yah I just started monitoring the Chinese price
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:00:45
Use bitwage
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:27:34
Let's agree on $1,250
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:41:02
More decentralized fake volume
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:51:57
Well we're waiting on segwit
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:53:09
Hope ver goes bankrupt soon
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:40:58
No when you have the keys they're recoverable
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:18:20
Like this 
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:53:39
That would be obvious
@_date: 2017-01-28 11:16:19
What luck
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:27:43

Thanks trunk
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:07:06
He's wrong, stocks are gambling and are very disconnected from companies these days
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:49:41
Luke was right
@_date: 2017-01-26 12:20:32
I understand now but not at that magnitude yesterday
The mempool growing to 60k within a few hours is spam, I watched it myself on my node
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:14:32
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:14:57
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:05:31
Not true, you have an iou not ownership, you don't own money in a bank either, you're a low level creditor
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:42:24
Because you're lying we take the opposite
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:38:44
That's a stupid plan, we have nothing in common with the new app
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:10:24
Sure but I wouldn't worry about small purchases, then again fifo could make your strategy moot
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:49:31
Odd not to use a Satoshi
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:32:49
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:11:07
Taxable better than banned
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:35:56
Ok that's true but if you look at daily transactions they were spammed
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:50:41
Inspecting what
@_date: 2017-01-18 07:12:10
 Yes he's an imbecile who's attacking allies and visiting enemies
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:22:01
No people aren't that dumb
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:42:44
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:06:59
You buy weekly
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:26:49
But not wires
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:04:57
Traders are gamblers, the outcome doesn't matter
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:23:19
No I'll whisper in your ear
@_date: 2017-01-26 12:18:30
The mempool growing to 60k within a few hours is spam no matter how you explain it, I watched it myself on my node
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:40:07
What a clown, now our taxes are going to a wall instead of healthcare
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:28:00
Beyond fraud
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:10:40
Yeah fuck the miners
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:01:28
You submit a block with diff &gt; target
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:44:14
Import the url hash into a brain wallet and you'll get the private key
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:42:43
I was too fast
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:02:47
You'd have other problems, hence why my name has Glock before btc
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:29:18
No this is the guy that murdered his neighbor and ran, did you pat him down? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:02:51
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:02:00
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:52:20
They removed Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-17 04:19:52
It would take months or years to verify blocks on mobile chips
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:10:01
Try Gemini
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:00:51
Shitcoin like to follow then crash
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:01:15
What happened to

Better not be onecoin
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:44:36
We'll be dead and secondly fees are already .5-1 btc per block
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:10:56
Fuck them
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:05:04
As of now I recommend businesses sell the Bitcoin then buy personally with profit.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:55:21
Lol got me
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:24:19
Can my light bulb mine
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:00:48
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:47:17
It's the same people who like massive inflation and massive supply of 100,000,000 etheriums. These people can't do basic math
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:14:42
Good their violent volatility hurt everyone
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:45:31
Ban his Reddit too

@_date: 2017-01-04 18:57:56
Sad! 
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:34:07
They're losers
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:23:45
No that's taxable
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:41:47
@_date: 2017-01-01 04:57:47
Play around
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:08:00
Are you sure you're using the new cli binary? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:33:28
If it's lower than that it'll come back to you
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:19:56
Intentional structuring is a felony at least in the usa
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:59:02
Yes this is us making up for gox, now we really begin
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:22:27
That loser sells over priced gold bux
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:24:37
Don't be so gullible
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:57:10
A uk exchange just added free trading, might be them
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:30:54

@_date: 2017-01-31 13:14:39
Trump is only getting started, buckle up
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:24:33

@_date: 2017-01-01 17:24:47
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:16:45
There's only Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:48:40
You must know much of the password
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:16:58
Anyone can lie
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:09:30
Yes you are, you're even paying for retweets
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:49:05
Really need a hardware wallet if over 1 btc
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:19:32
That is useless usually
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:24:33
That's been hard forked, the true eth is called etc now
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:59:47
You mean killing ppl in Syria and taking Ukraine
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:27:14
Uh oh
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:50:53
Update, we haven't had a block in an hour, very unusual and will fix any second
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:19:56
Yeah I left one star
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:05:42
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:14:13
Try bitcore
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:14:18
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:56:46
Well it had the old version number a "known issue"
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:31:51
Lol you'll end up kidnapped in a fake trailer
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:55:47
Traders want to trade, truth doesn't matter, they're waiting to get back in though
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:47:46
Half yes, the other half he hires. He's publically buying retweets and miners.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:21:48
Yeah I remember it was 10:1 for ages
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:44:53
Arbitrage is a great thing
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:28:36
On that note, I didn't realize Canada had police srs
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:33:11
Look at yourself snitch 
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:46:21
Haha he's not allowed in the usa
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:14:02
No we didn't invest in the wall
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:07:33
You send to a real wallet
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:23:24
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:23:21
The asks go up
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:44:20
Fiat is monkey money
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:42:05
Never heard of it
@_date: 2017-01-16 06:10:01
You should move it 
@_date: 2017-01-22 16:24:13
Just don't give anyone money and enjoy the ride
The photos are obviously fake though
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:17:59
That site is fake news, literally
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:17:41
No it's fully centralized
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:20:59
You go to a real exchange
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:44:14
They don't have that hashing
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:18:06
Arbitrage is the only thing that keeps all the exchanges in similar prices
@_date: 2017-01-12 11:07:16
Whale pool
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:14:12
There's many very concerning questions about etherium being a scam
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:45:13
Horrible idea
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:35:19
He's a scammer
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:42:20
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:47:23
Mempool has been tiny lately
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:32:29
They dump their shitcoin obviously
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:05:13
Stock markets will be more volatile than Bitcoin, watch
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:44:42
Worthless scum is going to pump and dump select shitcoin
The problem when you shitcoin is that everyday is a new one. So do you "diversify" into eth, xmr, zcash, ltc, dash, and hundreds of others. If you don't understand that they're pump and dumps, you get left holding the bag because tomorrow is a new shitcoin
People are already starting their pumps in the comments
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:16:07
It's not bad. Copay is much easier tho
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:11:57
Let's do this
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:06:18
Yes it's regular income if held less than a year or two I forget but you'd probably still fall in 15%
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:51:28
There is no build
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:43:38
Coinbase is incompetent
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:49:22

@_date: 2017-01-10 04:15:51
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:43:39
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:41:36
I'd do it only when you sell
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:45:47
No they fled the country
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:48:06
Well if you buy $15 now you get $1,000,000 in the future. He sends it back then instantly gets $1,000,000
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:46:55
There's only a couple stocks propping up the dow, the crash won't be pretty
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:18:25
You bought stuff with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-26 12:16:32
That proves much spam expired
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:18:28
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:45:48
Takes Nigeria to report
@_date: 2017-01-23 04:17:50
Buying at the top of the housing market is a bad idea, wait for Bitcoin and houses to swap
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:41:25
It's to prove you own an address
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:49:05
Some like attention
@_date: 2017-01-01 07:40:04
@_date: 2017-01-15 04:20:06
Ps I'm big in the pants
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:44:38
I think the api got stuck but kept streaming then a refresh ignored that
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:43:09
I think it was 2017
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:12:36
You invest in a shitcoin that dumps? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:43:49
Wow you're gullible
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:41:48
I don't think you're a scammer, but you love stories
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:13:59
The guy who shills over priced gold
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:38:16
You'll be fine
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:31:13

@_date: 2017-01-05 14:23:06
20 
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:45:55
It's a one time thing
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:13:03
Distribution is much better than before
@_date: 2017-01-18 06:17:46
This guy is crazy and has already had a heart attack
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:57:26
Yes we've lost a lot with neobee, btcjam etc
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:44:35
Probably the built in tor
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:25:05
$100,000,000, $1 = Satoshi
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:42:43
Good the rc was screwed
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:07:51
Make sure you got a valid file
@_date: 2017-01-15 12:31:31
It went up to 21 though from 22, then again 10 years ago it was 10
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:01:48
Nah we're lucky they classified it like this
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:06:41
Don't get too close ;)
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:25:51
Cloudfront and akamai are suicide. Buying a hundred dedicated servers is even cheaper
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:54:45
That vanity address might be everywhere and continue receiving for a while too. They should release the private key
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:46:04
Can I hodl your sister
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:17:14
You can buy Bitcoin like a stock in your brokerage account

Yeah didn't see that coming but much of it is fake. I see anti core rhetoric in eth trying to pump eth, calling us blockstream core when that shitcoin has one kid that can fork by himself

Remember that ver and r/btc support stolfi, buttcoin and shill etherium which has massive inflation and massive supply of 100,000,000 coins. They're actively attacking bitcoin. Stolfi keeps writing lies to the sec to ban the etf and they support him.

So CB hold a quantity of bitcoin, in a bunch of their own addresses with their own private keys, and your balance on CB just shows what portion of that you are entitled to, should you wish to send it to anyone - then, when you send some bitcoin from CB, they just take some out of whichever address suits them and deduct the amount from your 'balance'?
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:47:39
Change your address
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:56:06

@_date: 2016-11-22 02:34:24
Maybe someday
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:55:42
Just Coinbase and Gemini

Fuk Coinbase! 
Worthless scum is going to pump and dump select shitcoin
The problem when you shitcoin is that everyday is a new one. So do you "diversify" into eth, xmr, zcash, ltc, dash, and hundreds of others. If you don't understand that they're pump and dumps, you get left holding the bag because tomorrow is a new shitcoin
People are already starting their pumps in the comments
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:59:49
They have records and ids yes, analysis would lead straight to your id with a subpoena
@_date: 2016-12-27 07:03:36
Ver led the Wright scam, who knows why
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:07:40
Nope he's a liar with a big ego. "Invested" in many shitcoin and spends a lot living in a Tokyo loft
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:56:59
Yes it's a real exchange
They have reversed trades in the past but only for obviously wrong trades like $9 or $9000 otherwise your order is locked
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:33:00
Well those guys love etherium which has 100,000,000 coins and counting

You don't have to buy bitpay can automatically convert to fiat. It's so you have fiat for expenses in case Bitcoin crashes. Also you'll have a clear 0 capital gain on the business side then buy Bitcoin personally
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:58:15
Ver and shills are using the illusion of big blocks but they're attacking bitcoin

@_date: 2016-11-23 05:34:59
Ver is a founding investor in zcash, if he can hurt bitcoin he will 
He doesn't care about Bitcoin's future because he's "diversifying" and involved in pump and dumps, his only goal is to enrich himself

That was funny
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:46:18
He sounds delusional, Chinese miners hate big blocks. Why would they want unlimited and why would they kill a fee market that is really helping them right now? 
Core gave them great fees. Miners don't care about throughput at all technically.

I think they're getting a lot of people

Yeah there's no reason to keep a large miner if he starts acting up
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:25:58
Our nodes would reject their fork

@_date: 2016-12-09 10:07:50
Are you sure you understand the massive massive supply and inflation eth has? It can't go up, it's not possible. When it goes pos it'll just be a ponzi
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:02:59
You can't lose more than the transaction. Maybe you're mistaking a change address. Give it time to settle, you didn't and cannot lose $400. That's not how Bitcoin works. Also you can't be a double spend victim as a sender

Very shady to need a new pump for a failure
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:25:28
Ps a time sensitive investment sounds like a scam. So there's no tax basis since you're immediately sending them

Wrong etherium is a centralized shitcoin that's losing value daily
@_date: 2016-11-04 07:07:19
Coinbase is horrible in all aspects, those scum are still pumping etherium
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:14:52
It's obvious at this point it's his control vs core. Not scaling, because segwit is on chain scaling. If core only wanted LN or side chains he'd be right but this is a power play. And he's hurting us all.
The business community cares about how scaling is done? No he's bullshitting. Don't forget that he's tried pumping ethf and is a founder of zcash. His ego is attacking us now.

@_date: 2016-11-20 05:03:55
Idiots don't realize that segwit is on chain not lightening
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:05:31
Same here
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:37:18
Fuck them
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:12:09
Yeah I use square cash
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:56:43
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:21:19
No it's a scam, etherium has massive supply, massive inflation, pos ponzi, weekly forks
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:31:25
You provided liquidity, we wouldn't be here if no one bought and sold
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:34:18
Not totally true, it's a curve and people can start paying less
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:47:46
They do, they'll always work especially if you saved the file. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:42:06
Banks paid them off, Bitcoin was doing too well
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:19:39
What would be a better name
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:06:40
They said Bitcoin is a ponzi and it's $1000. Onecoin will do the same! 
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:50:51
Will copay be updated
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:22:10
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:47:31
Fuck circle
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:36:18
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:08:33
And when's the opening bell
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:51:52
If it doesn't confirm you'll get it back
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:54:41
Yes that's how rich people work
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:53:11
Wtf $7 illegal now? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:21:49
Antpool wants bigger blocks yet mines empty blocks
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:19:03
 this guy keeps obsessive data
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:57:10
That's why it's absurd they want bigger blocks
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:49:59
A Prayer for Owen Meeny? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:07:18
Yes we boycotted them for a while but the embargo is lifted for the time being
@_date: 2016-12-15 07:51:31
It's obvious at this point it's his control vs core. Not scaling, because segwit is on chain scaling. If core only wanted LN or side chains he'd be right but this is a power play. And he's hurting us all.
The business community cares about how scaling is done? No he's bullshitting. Don't forget that he's tried pumping ethf and is a founder of zcash. His ego is attacking us now.
@_date: 2016-12-11 04:12:53
Because they get banned
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:34:43
Are they commemorative? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:45:55
I spit on my app
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:53:45
How about mine are crawling
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:56:38
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:50:23
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:25:11
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:00:05
Then why throw it away on shitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-11 04:19:13
We are being watched
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:42:10
You can't lose Bitcoin, unplug it as you wish. It's not data like you think
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:56:07
Only ver is against it because he's attacking bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-10 14:02:11
On chain scaling is their agenda? Ours too!
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:33:12
Segwit has a variable that can increase the mb
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:18:12
Do you have the recovery? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:27:24
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:22:43
My pleasure. That depends on whether it gets confirmed, come back later
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:04:07
I wish, arbitrage would decrease their cost and increase our price
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:34:21
They're Olympians
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:34:45
You won't make a cent
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:09:13
It's not April though 
Lol 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:04:32
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:38:19
No we recommend never using a third party, it's the primary benefit of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:41:27
If you have more than a couple then a trezor is best
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:10:48
Yes there's Ver
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:44:57
Check anx
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:07:09
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:11:29
NO get copay
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:03:27
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:31:08
Lol those shitcoin clowns are delusional
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:15:33
Republic is better
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:42:56
No short is bad too
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:19:46
Circle is a bitch
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:13:39
He's a professor
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:55:07
Geez did you use a 8mm camera or clean the grease off the phone lens
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:41:47
Hope she's not friend zoned, she likes you bro
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:10:21
Trading is gambling
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:13:10
Coinbase has gone full shitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-02 10:15:46
@_date: 2016-12-12 01:51:07
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:55:32
They know it's an attack on bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:50:01
When 1 Bitcoin can buy a house
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:15:53
We're going to run out! 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:23:25
If they have different ips, though clients won't connect to more than one in the same subnet
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:31:12
That fee doesn't seem that bad
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:32:36
He's scum
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:25:50
Yes we need segwit and lightening
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:35:58
They have a legacy wallet which you'll have to find
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:28:08
Until a gold digger steals it
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:22:42
That's what happens when you give up your morals for ethf
@_date: 2016-12-19 22:55:56
u/nullc or someone posted this month about how max_block_size would be replaced in segwit
@_date: 2016-12-21 11:06:25
Bitcoin obviously, all others are called shitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:50:51
Many agree, but life is ridiculous. It should be like 10 years
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:05:27
And fork weekly
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:54:18
Gold is technically 0 tps
@_date: 2016-12-07 04:59:35
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:05:55
Why can't you login again
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:16:45
Available where? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:01:25
WE SURVIVED
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:38:16
Don't be suicidal
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:55:33
There's different inputs not one 10
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:28:48
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:42:32
So they get a new ath every time they change their name? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:36:56
Stupid vers site
@_date: 2016-12-12 10:14:28
Sure the embargo is lifted but the past still haunts
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:35:50
Have they alerted those merchants? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:23:44
But since Bitcoin is every country it only needs tiny parts of each currency
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:35:24
Nice pulled out 700 btc
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:54:46
Use a real wallet
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:22:54
No more circle, use ach
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:04:06
Hmm 16 people
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:03:34
A bitch
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:35:57
Vitalik is a scammer
@_date: 2016-12-21 10:22:18
You're talking exchanges. Bitcoin also has exchanges which can do millions of tps. What you're describing isn't electronic. Bitcoin is developing offline bearer instruments
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:36:24
We'll sell when you buy
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:55:42
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:55:56
Postal planes which could've had a fire, gox users
@_date: 2016-11-02 11:15:27
She's chill ��
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:16:45
If it's not Bitcoin it's a scam, very simple
@_date: 2016-11-23 00:13:06
Ver is a founding investor in zcash, if he can hurt bitcoin he will
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:59:21
Dude you never sell
@_date: 2016-12-26 00:40:16
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:20:38
Don't keep your tether there
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:59:56
I like those
@_date: 2016-12-08 08:06:17
This is just a green address with an off chain contract
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:23:24
Print the local Bitcoins and a bank withdrawal receipt and blockchain screen with date and you'll be fine
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:36:37
True but they see your address is different than your ip, they see massive fraud and are touchy
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:18:45
What was the high this year
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:08:24
He'll only get one unless he also gets your master PUBLIC key there's a risk
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:12:36
Did you use a vpn
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:32:48
Coinbase is trash who desperately pump etherium
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:26:42
It would decrease it
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:02:42
Can you lick it
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:49:19
You mean btc 90/703.63=0.1279081335
@_date: 2016-12-05 05:58:33
Yeah the guy is a verified clown, check zcash, he's their founder. The guy is obviously attacking bitcoin and pumping his shitcoins
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:01:40
Yeah but she didn't leak anything and who's to say the fbi emails were safer anyway
@_date: 2016-12-14 04:42:03
There's no term limit? 
@_date: 2016-11-04 01:52:24
Thanks we knew him well and he'll be missed. Did you know he ate a hat? 
At least he died very peacefully. I wonder who made that stupid head trauma photo
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:00:10
Bought some suckers
@_date: 2016-12-11 04:02:36
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:12:56
No a good wallet let's you own your keys forever
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:06:39
I hodl. It's not a fucking saying, you do or don't! 
@_date: 2016-12-13 06:19:14
Yeah I lost to neobee
@_date: 2016-12-10 14:17:49
They're in jail
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:25:04
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:04:27
Have you tried entering that email address instead
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:28:17
You can't lose like that
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:02:47
u/memorydealers is attacking bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-19 13:17:14
that guy died..
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:14:36
Found it 
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:25:50
What country are you in
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:38:46
They only help here
@_date: 2016-12-10 00:48:39
Can't tell. Many shitcoin lied just as much
@_date: 2016-12-20 08:10:45
Coffee in many countries is a month's wage
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:24:17
Wow they're pumping some shitcoin named xrp, good thing I already closed my account
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:30:41
Bare minimum sir
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:25:42
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:45:12
We need a developer registration based on their beliefs
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:31:25
They let you empty it
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:57:25
What a bitch
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:25:29
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:26:37
Gemini is chill, it's the winkle boys ��
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:55:25
$8,000 next
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:32:33
Yes all addresses work forever but you should usually use a new receive address to receive for privacy
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:04:28
I think it was a bogus article
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:35:55
It's not too bad here actually
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:47:47
Younger generations want money on their phone not a chunk of metal
@_date: 2016-11-13 00:55:19
I'd recommend circle and copay as the wallet
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:20:01
4th time's the charm
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:49:45
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:37:49
Relax most won't be audited
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:04:02
Price was 797 now 789
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:31:49
Hmm I'd need a large Glock budget
@_date: 2016-12-31 08:26:51
It's been done already
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:05:49
Yah acting scum just like with gox
@_date: 2016-12-29 11:44:55
You pay income tax then reset the basis
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:09:16
It should be $5
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:20:55
Have you tried registering the email, otherwise you'll have to email him and beg, don't mention the amount
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:40:31
What are they planning to eat? 
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:48:05
No but the site is usable
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:48:00
Well he gave away a lot for Christmas
@_date: 2016-12-13 06:26:33
I can't tell Larry from Bernie anymore, which one is that
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:14:28
It's obvious at this point it's his control vs core. Not scaling, because segwit is on chain scaling. If core only wanted LN or side chains he'd be right but this is a power play. And he's hurting us all.

@_date: 2016-12-19 05:09:02
Will there be a party
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:56:24
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:56:20
Lock him up! 
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:13:43
Yes I but do like that blockchain leads to a Bitcoin wallet instead of a banker
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:21:02
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:25:00
You'll have to start experimenting and report back
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:21:17
Remember that leaking any private key can compromise master key
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:05:13
Have you seen their blog
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:51:49
Very good to hear
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:35:40
They're protected by stripe
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:46:28
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:53:22
You're an olaf shill? 
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:03:56
If ver actually wanted to help the community he'd fund the registry
@_date: 2016-12-10 03:10:05
You can easily fix it by hashing it a random amount say 12685x sha512 or use a fourth phone number as the hashing multiple
@_date: 2016-11-11 13:49:19
"Oh yah, my son, he's got a big imagination! He says that painting is worth millions of bitscorns, lol! I'll miss my boy :("
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:11:11
Fraud scam
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:08:29
Segwit is amazing technology, if BU had any skills and came up with it, he'd be heralding it 24/7
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:50:56
Seems good but I use square cash for that
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:45:28
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:12:35
They're paid shills, they don't care
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:52:43
Price is growing and segwit is really being awaited
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:49:33
Just don't keep them on the exchange
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:06:04
Much price
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:12:02
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:34:55
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:10:37
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:49:14
No but you could have a semi cold wallet if you wipe the app and write down the seed
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:38:55
No they're scams
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:37:10
Segwit is ready for further increases
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:55:25
Ver sell outs
@_date: 2016-11-13 08:28:06
But it's vertical
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:35:26
With copay but it should be the same
@_date: 2016-11-22 06:43:03
Because it's still very cheap
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:51:06
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:11:35
What approach
@_date: 2016-11-17 03:10:00
Their site should be up
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:49:22
Now who's blocking it
@_date: 2016-11-22 06:49:07
Blind Greed
@_date: 2016-12-21 12:37:01
$5 per share? 
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:32:41
Try libertyx
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:26:12
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:24:17
And your electricity $500
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:12:31
To send you confirm on the device so no malware can trick you, a risk is getting a bad deposit address though
@_date: 2016-12-21 12:36:11
We were much more innocent back then
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:31:07
We hold
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:26:59
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:29:14
She pretended to go see him? 
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:55:00
@_date: 2016-12-13 08:51:27
Hahaha loser
@_date: 2016-12-10 03:08:49
They still do
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:37:33
True they wanted more billionaires in the white house
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:14:26
Cowards didn't trust each other lol
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:22:00
They closed
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:02:19
Maybe someday they can be useful like circle was
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:53:13
Whale pool may hurt you
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:39:50
Coinfire was legit but closed, ccn was Homeros bitch
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:19:48
Maybe order a cobranded trezor
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:51:24
It's been an hour
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:17:19
I too can create billions of shitcoin and premine 99%

@_date: 2016-09-05 11:12:24
Lots of free coupons then too complicated to move
@_date: 2016-09-08 23:46:34
I don't see blinking lights
@_date: 2016-09-26 13:41:13
If cboe hates bitcoin but I bet they love any asset
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:00:43

Some may work, someone's gotta try it
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:21:54
That's worse because it's income, bitcoin isn't considered unless your winnings gain further gains. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 03:51:20
Visit for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:54:50
It helps the system scale and can raise prices so miners will
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:27:55
Any cocks? 
@_date: 2016-09-04 01:44:18
Unless you can afford the printer
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:40:59
Yes bitcoin builder did that
@_date: 2016-09-22 13:57:28
Bitcoin was created with a limit of 21 million.
@_date: 2016-09-07 23:38:39
He sounds like Homero of paycoin pumping etherium
@_date: 2016-09-01 10:17:55
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:41:12
I'm not sure how or where the $1 is going.. Are they grabbing tokens from anyone that has them? Then depositing $1?
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:33:00
A lot of it is coming from professional etherium pump and dumpers
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:52:21
Hackers will be hackers
@_date: 2016-09-07 19:00:14
They're busy working on dapps

@_date: 2016-09-12 05:12:46
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:34:35
Haha no he has a lot of videos of him being cool
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:52:58
They were probably stolen accounts but PayPal did say digital items are harder to chargeback now so fight
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:00:51
Try a brain wallet
@_date: 2016-09-10 06:07:48
@_date: 2016-09-25 00:26:20

@_date: 2016-09-21 17:59:28
In his basement?

The coins don't even exist

He looks younger
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:15:48
They snort fentanyl
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:00:37
Gypsy vs Homero. Paycoin, onecoin and etherium can all go fuck each other
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:28:49
Almost no shitcoin use them beyond trading so wallets are just hype, they won't be missed since they're not used
@_date: 2016-09-07 12:50:21
Hope they aren't pumping etherium
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:30:42
Weird they wouldn't tell you that
@_date: 2016-09-10 00:38:40
This is a scam, why's it still up
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:56:27
Brian is a coward and an idiot

@_date: 2016-09-01 14:11:28
This stupid site has a pop-up that doesn't let you read anything
@_date: 2016-09-25 01:13:01
Dude you're clueless
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:59:23
The only attention he gets is from buttcoin and he thinks he's being funnier for them
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:47:33
It's hard to help those people, just stay away and block them all. The coins don't actually exist and there is no mining, the gypsy lady is just taking all the money. Greed is blinding.
@_date: 2016-09-14 09:07:49
They aren't restored, you need the backup but it can be decrypted with the seed
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:25:51
No don't ever click anything
@_date: 2016-09-21 12:33:22
Cool, I also want to short etherium

Ooh he confused me with openbazaar
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:43:16
I don't see any issue, name it differently
@_date: 2016-09-26 14:50:21
Bitcoin or not bitch shouldn't be demanding a tip and banning you. Consider it a holiday card that you once used as a tip and she spit on you and shreds it. Stupid the mom values tips over sales.
@_date: 2016-09-27 15:30:44
2008 was just a glimpse

They don't control it, most people just don't want to run random software from ver
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:16:29
Just use a coin flip
@_date: 2016-10-08 15:10:51
It's called a change address
@_date: 2016-10-08 15:09:04
They do exist Piper Wallet
@_date: 2016-10-10 18:32:48
It is when they have multiple forks  and they pump shitcoin at r/btc, so they create fud, no one solution then pump others so yes
@_date: 2016-10-05 04:58:43
Maybe he's invested in onecoin, he sounds stupid enough
@_date: 2016-10-13 17:19:46

Etherium is a scam From day one
@_date: 2016-10-19 09:37:07

VerBTC should be cauterized
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:43:28
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:51:02
No but there's options for moving your private key to mycelium, find a tutorial
@_date: 2016-10-29 01:29:28
It's like a stock and can go down. You could sell and only keep your profit in bitcoin and you'll have 0 risk
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:50:16
People think it's a shitcoin like etherium which you can keep forking and breaking
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:37:59
I think you should be on btc
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:47:04
Gotta build those dapps lol
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:50:12
Ver and friends fake it all. The Chinese miners despise bigger blocks, remember their complaints about the firewall? They aren't supporting ver.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:06:31
Get dat chedda
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:36:39

@_date: 2016-10-02 04:02:57
Hahaha really takes an idiot to believe them
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:37:48
So you broke even? 
@_date: 2016-10-10 18:45:32
Also massive supply and inflation
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:21:46
I'm guessing one off. To hide the announcement, etc
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:43:23
Call Charlie shrem
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:59:47
People would get a private key each, they can be hacked or sold I guess
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:48:48
Also you can make good money shorting stocks with trump. Both will see a later crash but trump is immediate
@_date: 2016-10-07 09:28:19
Sounds shady
@_date: 2016-10-08 13:52:55
They know during a panic sell and his can't be dumped so more hodling
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:55:51
Lol what's ven
@_date: 2016-10-28 22:44:51
Yes I wasted bitcoin on bfl miners
@_date: 2016-10-08 15:06:19
And etheriums is a joke as usual
@_date: 2016-10-07 09:01:40
Hope it gets cut down to like 25 years

This is true innovation
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:35:36
Btc=buttcoin, jstolfi accounts for most of their contributions
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:20:32
Ver would never verify this
@_date: 2016-10-09 13:00:36
He wants unlimited
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:55:50
Trump can buy more portraits of himself
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:05:59
Suck it ver. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 06:41:55
Standards help everyone
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:37:42
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:30:17
Hashrate has increased tremendously
@_date: 2016-10-10 13:17:03
None hope they understand transaction fees. Also never heard of them.
Ver is doing this as a disguised attack on bitcoin and his followers are clueless. He gets desperate when his erherium is dumping.
It is an attack when they have multiple forks  and they pump shitcoin at r/btc, so they create fud, no one solution then pump others 
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:17:20
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:59:30
Almost all those sites are scams
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:52:53
His lucky number
@_date: 2016-10-05 12:48:07
It is fraud, there are no coins, no mining, no blockchain. The videos are also fake 
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:12:16
Happy Vijayadasami

@_date: 2016-10-29 07:49:42
You've been gone a while
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:04:13
Better to trust multiple sources and make sure they match
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:04:44
Run his PHP
@_date: 2016-10-30 05:14:32
Give them a few more days
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:44:15
No the future is autonomous cars paying others to get out of the way for rich people to pay poor people who can wait
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:13:21
Wow that fee is new, PayPal used to eat it which was nice actually
@_date: 2016-10-04 03:20:57
Massive scam

Mis ojos

@_date: 2016-10-07 10:51:43
Maybe circle? 
@_date: 2016-10-28 03:07:22
You trust solely Matt but he's trusted. He also runs a relay network
@_date: 2016-10-28 03:06:58
Thanks that was fast! Last one took weeks ;)
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:48:53
Dat demand
@_date: 2016-10-08 20:52:49
Should be coinbase
@_date: 2016-10-10 18:42:15
VerBTC looks like
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:47:46
Lmao they pump hard forks, that shitcoin does nothing else
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:37:28
Let it be, he was subjectively the best of them
@_date: 2016-10-01 04:54:23
It's true 
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:42:14
Ok I'll buy a license, where's the checkout? 
@_date: 2016-10-09 12:58:48
Where's the bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-19 11:52:10
Only private
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:14:20
The good thing is that their shitty host can't take the ddos bci usually gets so it'll never stay up to steal
@_date: 2016-10-15 01:25:02
You have to get the inputs from online then the signed tx from offline
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:36:18
This is why I'm divesting and buying shitcoin, there's no need for this success
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:20:29
Well the post pumps eth and rep

Decentralized has its costs
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:40:06
They sell your bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-01 21:29:09
4chan etherium would be funny
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:36:38
People gave millions to Homero

@_date: 2016-10-10 00:13:41
Infinite? 
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:39:49
They're getting an extra .5 to 1 btc per block right now
@_date: 2016-10-21 05:37:02
It is confurm it is sec confurmed
@_date: 2016-10-09 13:00:08
Yes they are, there's no free things, you're lucky you didn't pay shipping where I thought the scam was going
@_date: 2016-10-02 12:52:45
There may be other tools where you can enter your seed
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:40:27
Yes but they don't like it, you need an exchange like gemini
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:48:32
Hmm ver is the clown tho
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:37:33

@_date: 2016-10-11 19:51:42
Can still sell the seed I guess
@_date: 2016-10-02 10:27:00
He probably has his paycoin still
@_date: 2016-10-10 19:12:50
True but having a fee market is also important
@_date: 2016-10-21 05:20:35
Onecoin is bigger scame lol
@_date: 2016-10-06 15:12:24
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:52:26
