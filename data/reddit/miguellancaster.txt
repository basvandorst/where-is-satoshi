I had over 1 BTC @ an average price of 4500
When it started dipping below that I got spooked, sold it all, and was certain I could rebuy in at closer to 3000
Watched it hit 3200, hang out at 3700, and told myself "I think we can go a little bit lower"
I never bought back in anywhere close to my original average. What a dummy
I started in 2016 and after the 2017 spike I promised I would hold until *at least* the halvening in 2020 no matter what. I should have stuck to that plan

Bitwage gives you a regular account/routing number to provide to your employer. My employer has no idea that I'm receiving a portion of my wages in Bitcoin, only that I have a second account that is paid into. Though, being that you work at a bank, yours might be able to do more digging and find out.

I applaud your determination, but relying on friends to pay my bills with their fiat is not something I'm prepared to do, and demonstrates - to me - that we aren't quite ready for full Bitcoin maximization. Again, kudos to you for trying to be a trailblazer but I just don't think most of us are ready (financially, not mentally) for that level of commitment. 
And realistically, I don't have any friends that would want Bitcoin and I'm not going to try and persuade them that they need it. I spread the word I'm small doses. They'll learn eventually, but it won't be me who convinces them.

I made a very overlooked post a while back where I compared the returns on doing a daily BTC purchase versus a weekly BTC purchase for one year from August 2017 to August 2018.
The gains were pretty lackluster compared to the actual purchases I had made on my own during the same period, "buying the dips" as best as I could gauge them. I made some pretty poor estimates on what those dips were, and was still seeing 40% returns at the time of that post. So, I fully expect that I will not see as good of a return on my Bitwage purchases than had I put the same amount of money into Bitcoin on my own, but I also don't know that I have the discipline to put the same amount of money into Bitcoin on my own.
It's more about forcing myself to commit, being that there are several more steps I have to take to stop these distributions with my employer. I will still be monitoring the results, though, and may put it to and end if it gets too disastrous. 
Side note: speaking of disasters, what in the fuck is happening with Ethereum right now?

Running up a balance barely hurts your score, to my knowledge. Credit used/Credit available is definitely a factor, but not nearly as much as on time payments are. 
So as long as you didn't buy more on credit than you have cash coming, then it really wouldn't be a big deal.
Not saying to do it, just saying.
If utilizing available credit significantly hurt one's credit, then no one would use credit cards or take out loans. It's really just about being responsible when it comes to paying it back.

I first started accumulating BTC in early-to-mid 2016, so I definitely have accumulated some patience along with it. In the grand scheme of things -- sure, I'm only down 3.5% on that first Bitwage transaction. No big deal. But the portion of my check in BTC is just a test run, and I'll eventually bump it up to 50 or even 100% of my wages. If I do that, there will be a larger chance I'll have to sell some of that back to USD to pay for something, and that's when I'd like to see their exchange rates be a little bit more competitive, or at least their fulfillment times a little snapper without paying for the premium tier service. Still, I am already in the semi-unique position of being a tipped employee, so I will always have in influx of USD cash even if my paychecks go 100% into BTC. One transaction on an exchange every two weeks isn't really going to keep me 'busy,' especially since I could just automate that with Coinbase (ignoring whatever reasons one might choose to now shit on Coinbase) so I'm just assessing the true value of the Bitwage service. 
Yes, I'm long on Bitcoin but I'm not quite ready to be a 'maximalist'  
Do you have a Shift card? How do you handle you day-to-day expenses being full BTC maximalist? I'm assuming you could probably retire right now if you wanted, so if being paid in Bitcoin gets in the way of a client paying you, that you may have the luxury of just not working with that client.

Thanks. I signed up and that's when I noticed the premium features. Most notably:

Does this mean that, on non-premium, for each paycheck I'll pay 10 USD plus an additional 1%?

I'm looking into using Bitwage for a percentage of my paycheck. Does Bitwage provide detailed information for each buy?

Thanks for the reply, good to see when a company is active in the online community
As long as Bitwage keeps track of USD/BTC purchase price, then I should be able to track things just fine. I take it that's the information that would be included in the .csv history?
How do fees compare to, say, Gemini or Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:20:02
Are you still in 100%? Do you ever sell for USD or are you operating totally in Bitcoin? I'm thinking of starting with maybe 20% of my checks. 
So long as they provide a historical record of USD transferred and the amount of BTC that purchased, I can track gains/losses on my own. I'm assuming that must be a pretty standard feature, yeah?

Not sure yet because I haven't fully looked into it, but if its a platform for scheduling BTC purchases then it would suit my needs just fine.
That's currently all I use BitWage for, as a second payable account on payroll at work so that I can devote a portion of every paycheck towards Bitcoin and ensure that I'm regularly averaging in outside of manual purchases.
Being that I live and work in the US and don't freelance internationally, I could simulate the same effect and possibly for cheaper with Shrimpy. I'm getting a bit tired of BitWages massive spreads on BTC value at time of payment.
So no, it wouldn't provide a routing number that gets converted to BTC, but I don't necessarily need that. Am I wrong in understanding that Shrimpy aims to be a bit like M1 Finance is to a stock portfolio but with crypto instead?

I'm fine with using a spreadsheet, but building it from scratch is daunting. The Blockfolio app already mentioned in another comment was nice in that it required no permissions at all, but it isn't doing what I need it to do.
I want to track BTC buys/sells on exchanges, the associated fees, BTC wallet transfers, spending, and received BTC and be left with a simple % gain at the end based on total lifetime USD spent, with fees accounted for.
I'm not totally clueless when it comes to building spreadsheets, but that is too complex for me to accomplish in any reasonable amount of time. There must be a pre-built solution.
Basically I want Google Finance but for Bitcoin. But I also want to be able to track non-exchange transactions and regular old bitcoin spending/earning.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:25:25
Checking it out now, but it appears that you can only add buy/sell transactions on exchanges to track. There doesn't seem to be an option to add a transaction that is simply spending or being sent bitcoin, and I'd like to track that as well and take those transactions into consideration when assessing my gains.  
Maybe I'm missing something.
The app doesn't track fees either.

I like this idea and would use it but I don't like the idea that I have to link my Coinbase and Banking accounts. How do I trust that is secure? How can you assure than the proper security measures are implemented in the event that a hack  would occur? Seems like I'm just opening up one spot to attack two different and very sensitive sets financial information.
Also, the website needs to be more upfront with the fees. I can't see any mention of them. What kind of fees will be assessed for converting multiple transactions in sub-dollar amounts?
Will it behave like Acorns, where Bitcoin will not be purchased until a set threshold is met, such as $5 worth of roundups? Also, again, what are the fees?

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:02:16
I know that is a possibility. I'm interested in holding long-term, but was just trying to get a better grasp on the mathematics.
For instance, my first buy was for about 1/4 BTC back when it was around $450, so my returns on that portion of my holdings are absolutely astronomical percentage-wise. 
But with my averaged purchase price of around $3000/BTC, I was just wondering if the math works out that if I were to sell above 3000, buy back in below 3000 (yes, I know that is a risky thing) and then BTC reaches a new all-time-high afterwards, would my returns be overall higher percentage-wise since I managed to buy back in at a lower average purchase price, or is there a mathematical advantage to having the portion of holdings that were purchased at such a low original price?
Not saying I want to attempt this strategy, but I'm just wondering if the math checks out.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:09:01
Thanks for the reply. I'm currently not in a panic at all. I've been holding long enough to truly believe in the future value of Bitcoin, but I wasn't around for the big dips of yesteryear, and there is a small amount of concern. I'm prepared to weather the storm and win big, but I'm also prepared to lose it all. 
I don't know that I would attempt the sell and re-buy strategy that I outlined, as it does seem quite risky and very possible that I would end up increasing my average purchase price.
I just wanted to be certain that I had a proper understanding of the math. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:21:08
I'd like to know more about this as well. I know GDAX has a form to request an increase on your daily withdrawal limit. I would imagine "I have 1.9M dollars that I need" would be an adequate enough reason for that request to be granted, but who knows?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:23:12
So if I move my BTC from my Coinbase wallet into GDAX for trade prior to the fork, then within 4 hours of the actual fork I will supposedly have equal amounts of B2X and BTC available for trading, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:57:57
I actually bought even more yesterday at 5700 exactly. Was really pleased with how that worked out. I plan on holding for a long time, and continuing to buy, I'm just trying to get a better understanding on some aspects of trading. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:32:35
I'm really hoping so. I cashed out last year as a safety when it dropped below 4400. That was my average purchase price of all the BTC I bought from 2016 up until that point. 
Watched it hit 3200 and thought (Man, that probably would have been a good re-entry price) and dawdled around doing nothing the whole time it sat under 4000.
Now this pop and I'm still not holding. Anything sub-4000 and I'm going all in and not looking back.

Being federally illegal, recreational cannabis dispensaries operate as cash-only businesses. This allows them to accept other forms of payment using BTC as an intermediate, without forcing customers to use an ATM.
Is it acting as a glorified ATM? Essentially, yes, but to call this a scam is highly inaccurate. It's not perfect adoption, but it's a step.
And I wouldn't be surprised if other businesses that are even more forward-thinking aren't keeping a portion of these transactions as BTC without immediately converting them back to cash.
Amazon and every other business already have the option to accept credit cards, paypal, whatever. So yes, BTC as an intermediate is pointless for them. For cannabis, it is not.

This is a bad headline, but the meat of the article is that Intuit and H&amp;R have been spending millions lobbying to make government pre-filled returns impossible in the future
"The bill, called the Free File Act of 2016, looks on the surface to be consumer-friendly. It makes permanent a public-private partnership in which 13 private tax preparation companies — called the “Free File Alliance” — have offered free online tax filings to lower- and middle-income families. The Free File Alliance include both Intuit and H&amp;R Block.
But the legislation would also permanently bar the IRS from offering its own free alternative."
Pretty scummy if you ask me. Not at all related to Bitcoin though.
