Apologies accepted. The way you explained it makes sense. 
Mycellium doesn't seem to have a problem as most go through the PS anyway. It's just not an option for me. So I will wait for the 1.0 release. Best wishes for you.

Electrum servers are a no brainer. I have a script that completely automates the process and can even set it up as a tor hidden service. I have the same script for a btc full node. They work on debian (should be ubuntu too). Let me know if you're interested.

I stated my version in my orig. post: 1.9.8. You're referring to the development version. I don't think I need to be using that version because the guides I stated originaly and the electrum wiki on signing raw transactions all use the command **signrawtransaction**. If you look here:  you'll see that the development version no longer has that command.
Edit: Electrum 2.0 is having trouble installing on debian for me. Even after following all steps on the site and checking the README I get this error: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;
    util = imp.load_source('util', 'lib/util.py')
  File "lib/util.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;

I appreciate your code for a workaround (and I have used it), but I'd like to figure out what I'm doing wrong now so that I can build a strong foundation of understanding.
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:07:48
Thanks for the lightning reply!

YES! Take that middlemen.
I'd like to mention that merchants could easily integrate this with a hardware wallet as well. :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:05:26
I'm getting an error, but I don't have the debug log any more. My guess is that I have the syntax incorrect. Could someone write out the syntax needed. For instance with bitcoin-qt it's something along the lines of:    signrawtransaction '**RAW TRANSACTION ID**' '[{"txid":"**TXID**","vout":1, "scriptPubKey":"**PUBLIC KEY OF ADDY USED TO CREATE MULTISIG ADDY(?)**", "redeemScript":"**REDEEM SCRIPT IF APPLICABLE**"}]' '["**PRIVATE KEY**"]'

Thank you, that solved the first problem. Now I'm getting this:

You're right, geographical secrecy is not what I'm after. I just wanted a fun project. It does aid others to hide their physical location if they choose to. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:39:36
Wrong. Here's one example of Tor providing stronger security:

This post so made my morning.
I hope they open source those VHS players they're still apparently using. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:10:38
I'd like to call bullshit, please. In particular the part where you stated:


You could have easily backed it up before you sent coin to it. 
Don't ever again send coin to an address you don't have the privkey to. Simple. 
All things internet are fragile and buggy. Don't blame them for that. It was you that followed the steps incorrectly. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:36:33
I also have one running at:

    141.255.165.154:50002:s
and a bitcoin node at:
    rxaqcioo4u7xhdeg.onion
Thank you for your contribution. 1000 bits.
Just out of curiosity how did you do it? Did you use a guide, or just follow the steps on the github?
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:23:20
Privacy and added security. I made one of them a tor bridge relay to help support their network. Which is built, like the bitcoin network, by volunteers.

Really good answers. Nice project.
You might also mention the fact that once one buys your hardware, one owns it. A VPS is a reoccuring fee with nothing to show for it once you stop paying.

I've got a guide that's linked to from Ledgers knowledgbase: 
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:10:40
Why so expensive when you can do the same thing on an old laptop for free? Better yet why not buy an older thinkpad for $100 and have a computer too? Yet another option is to rent a server with sata storage 150gb for $60 per year. 
What is the advantage to your hardware? Isn't it just a bedazzled external hd?
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:20:03
The nodes can be configured either way. Right now mine are only available over tor. I will open them up to all connections once I harden the servers a bit more.

This is insane. Is Star Xu a child? 
There's only one way to prove authenticity, and if it says 
    gpg: BAD signature from...
then you're fucked. 
Star do yourself a favor and implode in a more private fashion. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:26:37
I prefer the ledger chromium app or electrum. I don't need/want another party involved in my transactions. Electrum also has multisig solutions.

This is a similar project, but a bit safer because it's air gapped. 
Do you plan on adding sx/libbitcoin? 
Why did you choose Ubuntu?

It's so easy I set up 2 hidden service bitcoin nodes today.

Would it be possible to create a tx with multiple nlocktimes with the current code? Say for ex. that you wanted to pay out in increments over time.

Really, do you know how much profit private companies make from public transpo. yearly? It's staggering, look at Vienna and the situation they're in (essentially renting their own pub. transpo.  from an American company).
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:11:51
That was for two of us, but still too much. 
A child minded 20 something made a joke about a lesser off person that was trying to con his way onto the bus because he couldn't afford it. I had to remind him that his taxes would be better spent on free busses for all instead of eyesore stadiums that block the mountainous horizon. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:56:46
I still think is a little different. It seems that the posts on focus more on developmental news. Coincode will be more code snippets and helpful command line shortcurts I would think. 
Maybe I'm wrong, but for me it fills a niche.

I would say it's a mediocre review from an inexperienced computer user/bitcoiner. It may be a good read for you if you also 'had trouble installing electrum' or use windows.

I have 1.9.8, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 on the same computer, but I run from source on linux. I have no issues this way. 
Another workaround for this problem could be importing your old priv keys to the new client. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:20:32
You need to follow the install instruction on electrums download page. I'm pretty sure you need to do:
