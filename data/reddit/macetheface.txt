I'd be really careful using [market buy](

Yeah but what you get back as a deduction is capped where what you owe on a gain is the full amount.  Better than nothing I guess.

Depends what you did and when you lost it though. If you made gains end of 2017, sold, then bought back in 2018 and then lost it all you still need to pay tax on the gains made from 2017.  Here's how I see it; correct me if I'm wrong.
Example: 
October 2017 - Buy 1 BTC at $6,000 
December 2017 - Sell at $10,000 - ($4,000 short term capital gain)
January 2018 - Buy at $12,000
December 2018 - Sell at $4,000 
You're now sitting on a $2,000 loss from the initial investment, but you still need to pay tax on $4,000 gain from 2017.

Earlier this year and last year, I used to see a lot of charts/ posts about the cycle times lengthening but those all used the tops for their predictions.  The ones calling for 4 year cycles continuing appear to be using the bottoms as their time reference.

I don't see the porpoise of it.

:D Yeah, as far as I know that type of chain analysis doesn't exist but the tax guy in [this thread]( seems to think IRS has that functionality.

Nice try IRS

What about subsequent capitulations? Think we'll continue seeing 80-85% retrace?

Well if it's a % of how many wallets exist vs world population, I'd wager we're just getting [started](

Sure thing it's from [here](  But, can really just google [Bitcoin Rogers Curve](
