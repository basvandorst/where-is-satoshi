Will this pollution cause a change in the Bitcoin climate?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:24:31
See I understand his point but saying that Bitcoin is slow in comparison to other coins seems ridiculous. Bitcoin was going to be slower not because it's slow but because it's the trail blazer. The first car was shit too compared to what we have now.

Yeah sorry man.

Damn has anyone thought of telling the car manufacturers about this?

I keep hearing about asic boost but I don't think I understand.

Flying cars are available, possible, and a person could theoretically buy one. Them being a niche market doesn't mean it failed. In all these examples it was experts saying that those inventions would never work or fail because of lack of interest or scientific understanding, but flying cars are being artificially stopped because normal people can't be trusted to drive cars normally let alone fly one. It's a bad example for the context of this discussion.
I was originally going to say sorry about the other commenter being a dick but you are just as dickish.

Except aeromobile and pal-v are both companies that are supposedly filling orders for the cars this year.
Edit: am I just being downvoted out of spite? Nothing in this comment is wrong and I named two companies who are creating flying cars. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 15:52:18
Are you saying they aren't real or that because you don't have one they aren't real? Did you consider the fact that if everyone owned a flying car it would dangerous as hell?

Somewhere between 16 to 17 times.

Okay? I'm not saying your wrong on that just that the banks are prime movers of the economy and we won't be able to get rid of them entirely.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:38:56
No, I'm saying they make a large amount of investments every day. They are a business and already have a ton of money so switching to Bitcoin would not change that fact. They will just switch currencies (Bitcoin in this case) and continue doing what they normally would do. I don't understand why you are being so hostile.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:52:13
Fine tell me why I'm wrong otherwise you might as well be a Russian bot account trying to stir up trouble.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:00:23
No I said provide an argument to what I said but since you seem hell bent on not doing that then I have to make the asssumption that you don't have an argument.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:56:50
That's a good one but completely based on the fact you think banks only store money. They do much more then that and if they felt the need could buy the majority of Bitcoin and still continue on doing what they are doing. Banks are primarily investors who get their capital by storing other people's money so switching to Bitcoin wouldn't change that purpose.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:14:06
I'm not but you won't provide any argument passed "lel u brainwashed pleb only I know the truth" but then refuse to tell anyone what the truth is. What are you expecting to happen? I'm willing to discuss it but you aren't, so I have to eventually assume that your goal isn't to help but to actually discredit Bitcoin. You make the people who want to use Bitcoin look like fanatics who are unreasonable and unwilling to look at how the world operates. You are making the problem worse by alienating people who could be allies and galvanizing the ones who aren't for the idea against us. Be better and provide an argument or stop talking and let someone else argue because you are making things worse for those who want to see change.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:47:53
I'm not sure how you managed it but you got three bots to reply to you and no one else. That is mildly impressive. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:33:24
This sounds ridiculous but it's also ridiculous that these men are beating their nuts into Oblivion.

True but I was thinking more along the lines that a fire isn't going to melt it. I just assumed the sheet would be in a safe or at least in a location where objects can't fall on it easily. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:25:46
Nah MRI would work better
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:01:38
That doesn't change it's melting point. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:47:20
Isn't blindly holding onto bit coin bad for it as a whole?it's a currency it should be used that way. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:45:43
I mean if it's pound for pound I think the Bitcoin might be worth more then all gold put together.
