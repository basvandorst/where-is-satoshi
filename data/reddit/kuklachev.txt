My goal was - creating an online wallet that I could be able to spend from relatively easy, signing transaction from an oflline run OS, so the private keys would never go to online machine. This solutions fits perfectly.

I doubt there is any sort of conspiracy. And Ukraine market share is too small to influence the BTC price.

Hi! 
I had the she question recently. Ended up creating Ubuntu LiveUSB with Armory wallet. Basically now I have a not so secure, but easy to use wallet on my PC for small amount of Bitcoin. And also have an encrypted offline wallet on my USB, where I keep everything else.
Spending from the PC wallet takes seconds, signing the offline transaction from the live usb is a matter of minutes. 
I found a good and step-by-step instruction how to set up the whole thing here:

Well, it's not as bad here as you might be thinking. But hey, thanks for your sympathies.

I arrived here just couple of weeks ago, first time since my departure 2 years ago. So far I've stayed only in Kiev. It changed a lot in many different areas. You can see a lot of people in military uniforms. Much more than before. What is obvious - new patrol police is always somewhere nearby - their blue flairs pop up randomly everywhere.
Prices have gone up, but the exchange rate has gone up too. So if you're having income in foreign currency, you're having a better life.
But I haven't seen a single person with an assault rifle or anything that would resemble a war. So, saying that the conflict in the east has been isolated would be quite right.
