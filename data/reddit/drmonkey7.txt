Bitcoin could put banks out of business, no?
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:39:56
So true.  OK, I support bitcoin ideas 100%.  Thanks for the lesson.

Kind of ironic how bitcoin is used to buy and sell MDMA illegally. lol

Obviously they just want to generate more volume.  Good for the stock price.  Its worth a shoot, if the proudct somewhoe takes off, more money in the bank for them.

I'd like the option to take physical delivery upon expiration.  I can;t believe the SEC is allowing this.  The whole point of futures markets are so you can settle out with actual commodity or stock at the end of expiration if you want.  The prices converge.  Its nothing more than slot machine where algo are going to be hitting it.  CME just wants in on the volume.  Greedy shit bags

They've already got one, you just don't know about it.  Now they'll be able to front run of their clients orders, which is perfectly legal because Bitcoin isn't regulated.  People are dumb
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:24:57
So, its not even connected to Bitcoin in any possible way?  They're just expecting huge market markets to keep the price in line with the actual physical contract.  yaaaa, right??  lol  ...CME group is SEC compliant, but yet the list a unregulated product to trade on on their system.  but, its just cash settle and involves no actual Bitcoins.  Kind of correct?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:14
Yea, like trade weather future.  how about housing futures.  Thanks CME.  
Being able to take delivery imo is the driver.  The futures and cash prices converge is important imo.

Super easy for a super rich guy to get tipped off in the tech world.  Was pocket change for him.  Fuck all you guys for creating ShitCoin.
