Yes, but the promise of price stability does essentially that. As long as he Fed is able to return all dollars by selling off its assets, it has ability to fully deflate the price of money.

Based on what? You are making a normative statement here about them deserving to be especially subsidized when that would entail society as a whole losing out. Coal miners already make more than the average person and right now the "revenues" from inflation go to the government, so even if you want to look at inflation as a tax, in this case it reduces inequality.

If all of your assets are in cash it's really your own fault to be honest.

Its portfolio theory 101 that if your currency has higher returns than some other currency than
a. it also has higher risk and
b. it has the same returns as a portfolio with the Sam risk made up of other assets. 
So you are never really given the option to not play the game, even if you invest in something other than fiat.

You know that inflation doesnt apply to non cash assets right?

Given that banks in the EU have to pay for cash that they deposit in the ECB it's not really paradoxical for them to make deals like this.

Given that their fiscal situation is fairly stable after all the debt forgiveness they received it's not crazy go think that Greeces default risk is comparable to that of Italy or Spain.

A mixture between state run institutions and pension funds are all legally bound to buy a certain amount of bonds, the amount of bonds the ECB holds is pretty small in comparison to all other bonds.

Inflation is supposed to get you to invest the money and not keep it under your mattress. The Fisher effect is a thing you know.
@_date: 2019-02-05 13:20:48


Which means that inflation doesn't actually affect non-cash savings.

Like what?

But any transactions done through anything else than a bitcoin wallet aren't actual bitcoin transactions.

What's the Fisher effect?

I like how you didnt mention stocks 
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:12:41
Stock just aren't in a significant bubble though. Its true for most commodities that at least part of their demand comes from pure speculation, but for stock we have metrics that can actually show how they are priced relative to their fundamentals, and [they are just not showing a bubble comparable to '00 or '08](

Yes, but the Fed has arrived at a pretty much neutral monetary policy (they say they are slightly expansionary, some believe they are already in contraction) so its not very likely that this is happening now.
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:32:01
The yield curve hasn't inverted yet my dude. 
Monetary policy consists of more than setting interest rates. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:01:57
What makes you think there is a recession coming? There are a lot of financial crises and stock market collapses that were preceded by an inverted yield curve but not preceded by a significant recession.

Imagine being middle class and not having a 401K

You know the person who wrote the article knows their shit when they capitalize all the letters in 'Fed'
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:11:40
The relative wealth doesnt matter lol. What matters is that middle class people with half a brain cell will not hold more than 10% of their portfolio in cash, which means the implicit tax from inflation doesn't actually impact them in a meaningful way.
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:47:51
Its a stupid hypothetical, but even more importantly this person seems to think that there are no assets that are protected from inflation. The BoE literally creates bonds that are indexed to the CPI.
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:04:16
Last time around it took 18 months after the inversion for the recession to start.

The fed is lending the money to them, so ultimately its the fed that does the lending. Profits from this go to the government. 
Banks are only eligible for a bailout if they are otherwise healthy.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:38:31
Just dont hold cash lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:53:21
What makes you think that a financial collapse in the near future will be similarly as severe as the great depression?
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:29:30
The fed isnt a legislative body
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:45:13
'08 was the most severe crisis since the great depression, its unlikely that the next stock market crash will be accompanied by a crisis as severe
