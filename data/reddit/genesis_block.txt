If it's illegal to accept bitcoin as payment then good luck getting businesses to accept it. Even charities wont take donations for it any more.
I always hear people saying shit like "only ebay or amazon has to accept bitcoin and we will be rich!11" yeah...good luck with that when it's illegal.

Think about it this way. The community has already shunned the cunt.
What happened when Bruce Wagner reached this point? He withdrew from the forums, tried to rebuild his reputation. Did he? No fucking way, not even close.
Quite simply, once we know you are a cunt, you are fucked. There is no recovering from this.
This fucker, he was even WORSE than the Gruce Wagster, he has fucking attacked us back in our faces, say we are the idiots. He is more than fucked, he is dead fucking meat, a worthless street WHORE.
That's all I have to say on the matter.

How many people do you know that mine gold? Exactly you fuckbag.
People DONT mine gold, they get a load of black kids with no money, pile them into a hole with no food or water, and say GET ME THAT GOLD RIGHT FUCKING NOW AND MAYBE ILE LET YOU LIVE.
So get your facts straight.

Not likely. In 6 months the reward for mining is halved and everybody is going to leave anyway.

Give me a break. The guy is a busy man, he doesn't have time for computer games like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-05-03 12:53:38
Nice try, but one of the first things people do when they first discover Bitcoin is download the regular client, shortly followed by a feeling of not understanding what the fuck is going on. I suspect the majority of potential users are lost at this stage.
New hosts follows the same downward spiral meaning less and less people are coming to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-05-07 16:53:50
Safe? LOL, you're using the wrong currency son.

Detectives on the forum worked it out before it was deleted by the mods. Probably an inside job or paid to remove it.

During 2012 so far, based only on the laws of mathematics and the laws of supply &amp; demand, Bitcoin has been used to purchase the least amount of goods/services than any other currencies on the globe. Thoughts?

I commend you for voicing your opinion, which is frankly the truth.
It's just a shame you will get downvoted into oblivion by the fanatics of this subreddit. It is these fanatics that actually hurt bitcoin more than levelheaded people such as yourself. They are what makes bitcoin such an immature geek toy instead of a viable currency.
@_date: 2012-03-28 18:53:22
Who cares? The guy is full of shit and always wrong anyway.
@_date: 2012-04-17 15:17:04
I agree but made a submission anyway.
[Hope you like it.](
Sadly all my accounts on the bitcoin forums are banned and I cba to make a new one, so I can't post it in the thread. I emailed it to them at least. To be honest I think I deserve the entire bounty for this magnificent creation.
@_date: 2012-04-28 20:51:59
fucking retarded shit. You could have read the private key and then can hack whoever you sell it to down the road.
If you buy this you deserve it stupid piece of shit. I bet somebody will since people that use bitcoin are fucking retarded. Like when they flock to gox after the fuckups in the past. You watch as it all burns down again soon.

A band nobodies heard of is exclusively for sale with a currency nobody uses.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!
@_date: 2012-04-27 17:19:32


They wont.
After a trial period the company will decide that Bitcoin isn't worth the effort as hardly anybody actually uses it to buy things. Bitcoin is a computer game for geeks called MtGox and Bitcoinica.
Source: experience with multiple companies that dropped bitcoin quick as it is more annoying to deal with payments than is worth it. They will be lucky if they get 5 customers with bitcoin, I doubt they will get even 3 before it's dropped and that factors in any loony fanatics from this subreddit buying it just to spite me.
