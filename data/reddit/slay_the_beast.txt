I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed. Would you mind elaborating on each of your points with sources?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:56:40
You’re welcome there any time
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:37:20
See you on the other side I guess man.. doesn’t hurt to hold more than one coin and read up on each. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:03:14
Sure, but an ERC20 token on top of ETH could be a currency. Peer to peer payments would be one of the simplest use cases of Ethereum.

Oh really? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:55:49
Uh oh, time to unstick the daily! ��
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:15:28
Biggest brand sure, but as a developer myself, all the interest I’m hearing is not around bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:49:40
So ETH processing almost 4x the number of transactions with lower fees... how do you explain that as needing to scale to have scaling problems?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:29:53
Correct, could be 72 really easy tests and 3 really fucking difficult tests left to satisfy. Tests are arbitrary and totally dependent on “what is this particular test trying to ensure”. It’s not like 72/75 is some sort of measure you can treat as % complete. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:22:31
Why’s that? Timeframe too long, or do you think Bitcoin will never reach those highs again. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:41:45
Ooh ooh! Me next! Craig Wright is certainly NOT Satoshi Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:55:07
Maybe. I also remember the days of news like this not moving the price, but a retraction or a reversal would then move the price down. Crypto makes no logical sense.

Also, the bank in one of the action scenes is “Trust US Bank”.

Each new ATH is super saiyan meme worthy
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:22:33
Not according to LN devs on Twitter...
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:21:06
I can read.. it’s literally his thesis that micropayments and bitcoin are not going to mix. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:04:54
That’s exactly what a neo-nazi boot licking fascist would say!!1!
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:04:02
This is amazing. Subtle troll is subtle. You got a nice smile from me. ����
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:17:31
I’m tired of explaining all the time. Someone else can field this one. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:54:53
You don’t, so it’s meaningless.
