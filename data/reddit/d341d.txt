You're not entirely correct here. The truth is, Coinbase could significantly reduce the mempool congestion. This is indisputable. This does impact regular people on a day to day basis making transactions more expensive and reducing fee prediction reliability.


Of course you're correct, it's not 100%. But, if Coinbase used SegWit and batching, it is actually realistic that this would bring enough alleviation that the mempool could begin clearing. The difference between "getting more full", and "clearing in the foreseeable future" are consequential, and the attention Coinbase is getting is warranted.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:41:10


This isn't necessarily true. What are you basing this claim on?


No, not on its own. But it is a positive step. To say "batching is not a long term solution" is much like an obese person saying, "cutting out one candy bar per meal is not a long term solution". Right, it's not the whole solution, but it sure as hell is better.


Bullshit. Un-batched transactions waste space opposed to batched. Space which would be used for other transactions, increasing transaction throughput, decreasing mempool, decreasing fees. It may be negligible, but it's absolutely better. To say "batching ... will not lower fees even in the short term" is much like an obese person saying, "cutting out one candy bar per meal will not lower my caloric intake in the short term".


Yes. We agree on this. But in the mean time, they can do segwit without LN, **and** batch. The obese person needs to focus on lifestyle changes and exercise, but he can also cut out the candy bar each meal and it is worth his while.


This is true, but it would be no less true if Coinbase implemented the efficiency improvements available TODAY! Everyone knows we have a major scaling issue to solve, and LN / 2nd layer development isn't going to stop or slow if the mempool starts getting chipped away.

I bought some of these but haven't used them yet. Your writeup was good, thanks.
I am thinking about putting a small amount of btc onto a couple of them and putting them in long-term storage. Give it 5 years, that small amount may be worth a lot, and what if, just what if there were some very special purpose forks afterward with a lot of value. Having those private keys gets you those fork coins too.

I've noticed the exact same thing. I am convinced that Roger and friends are playing pump and dump and the BCash pump is still on, they'll pump until near the 30th (btc retarget) and they'll dump maybe right before / during / after.
I totally believe that as they dump BCash, they heavily invest in other alts and even a bit in BTC to take advantage of the swing back. BCash corrects back to sub $2k but this pump (as silly as it is) has brought more money into BCash, so it reliably and predictably will level out at a value higher than it's pre-pump average around $1600.
Once it's back down there and the other alts have swelled from the exit, Roger and friends buy back into BCash with quite a bit to get in low in preparation for the next round. They may wait a couple re-targets, but you can see it coming as more articles / sub posts / etc start talking about how unusable bitcoin is and you'll see the mempool on Bitcoin begin to swell, BCash start's pumping slowly and then faster, then re-target, then massive pumping (next time maybe it'll sustain $5k for a while) and we're back where we are today.
Lather, rinse, repeat. Roger and friends made hundreds of millions, probably billions on the 2X game and they're using those funds to play this BCash game as long as it can last.
When Bitcoin has decent scaling solutions they'll probably give up on BCash when people have gotten wise and they'll get into some other venture. Who knows though, there is enough money coming in for the next year they might convince enough people that BCash actually has value and room in the market. It may even have a LN adaptation alongside Bitcoin and be a real currency with a life. That's probably best scenario for them, but they're not really counting on it or looking that far ahead. They're just making their millions pumping and dumping and are more or less happy with that for the time being.

Kind of. I've heard of mycelium before, but didn't realize this is what it was for. I downloaded it, the closest trade is a few hundred miles away from me (I'm in a city of over a million) and their asking price is over $20k, well above market rate.
This is perhaps a step in the right direction, but since it doesn't fully support arbitrary cryptos, not quite what I'm hoping for. Just like Bitcoin is open source, I'd like an open source trading platform, you run the software, ruled by consensus, etc. mycelium looks like local bitcoins with a different background.

I've run the numbers, and if you believe in Bitcoin longevity I think you're way better off mining than selling miners at a profit. But I guess this depends on your electricity cost and whether you have space to run all the miners.
Plus, selling miners gets you fiat, which is a lot more liquid than BTC and liquidity does count for something. You need to eat, right?

You didn't answer shit. You just spew off your best guess that sounds right to you without actually understanding so you can feel smarter than someone else.


It was a "store of value" when it was valued at $0.03 per BTC. Store of value isn't the only thing necessary. It's been a store of value for a long time, there are other factors in making it a viable means of exchange.


It's not so "obvious" to all of us. We're not all on your level.

How so? Maybe we have a different conceptualization of the term "adoption". By "adoption", I mean people using it, i.e. actually making purchases with it.


If that delay hurts retail, it hurts everyone.
If transactions are not going through, AMZN is not going to ship your order. This hurts the consumer and hurts adoption. People aren't going to use it if they're not getting their product after sending payment because their tx is stuck in the mempool.

I doubt you'll get much attention here. Maybe try the mining sub.
In any case, reddit might not be the best place to try to raffle.
I was faced with your problem too, you have a miner in hand that you could sell for a hefty profit, or you could use it to mine.
I ran the numbers, very conservatively I've calculated an S9 nets you ~$1500 more than the price of an S9 after paying electricity after a year's worth of mining. This is not great profit, and if you sold your miner today you'd probably net $3500 minimum profit in your pocket now. (assuming you're selling it new, in the box, unused).
However, less conservatively, if you use it to mine, optimistically, assuming (less than recent) decent BTC price growth, you're looking at an annual profit of $8k. Yeah, you might get more than this out of a raffle, maybe, but you're probably better off mining with it.
Bitcoin is here to stay. Mine those BTC and Hodl, and in two years I think you have a good chance of a massive return. Yeah, your raffle or just sale might net you some immediate gains, but personally I'm looking beyond that. Chances are you're way better off mining and hodling. (if you believe in BTC that is)

It feels pretty dramatic, there is a lot of emotional language. That's not cause and effect, or science.


If they "really don't want" it, then they wouldn't have bought it. Marketing isn't magic and it's not a spell. When you see a product on TV and are shown how happy it makes people. Even if this is a lie, it is the fault of the person who believes it that they believe it. I'm sorry, but you have to be responsible for your own brain. It is not LL Cool J's fault that you think Fubu will make you look cool. It's your own fault for believing it. And it wasn't a lie, some people actually think you look cool. You got what you paid for.


Look at your post history brother, for someone who's god isn't money it sure occupies a lot of your heart.

Looks to me like the cryptomarket as a whole is reeling a bit from the recent bull activity across the board the last two days. The pullback could be over already, might have just begun. You never know.
When I see a market like this I like to buy with 50% of accessible cash and if it falls further buy again with 50% of remaining, so on and so forth.
I think it's good to get into BTC before CME launch though it may be slow (compared to the last month) but I think CME gives us a boost over the course of next week. Saving some portion of cash to buy if BTC happens to get cheap after CME, did the same thing with CBOE.

Your question isn't stupid. The answers you have so far aren't helpful, sorry.
It's not. You wouldn't pay that kind of fee for your day-to-day purchases. Bitcoin needs scaling mechanisms to grow and compensate for these fees. One way we'll do that is the Lightning Network which allows (many many) transactions to be performed outside of Bitcoin network and then settled with a single transaction within the Bitcoin network. This scaling mechanism isn't quite ready for mainstream yet, but it will get there, so just hold tight.
Then we'll do lots of transactions for pennies (or less) on LN and then all of those pennies will add up to dollars to pay the one settlement transaction on the Bitcoin network.
This is good for everyone (including miners). And will make Bitcoin more efficient as a currency. Just be patient and hodl your bitcoin for a while. Only sell if your gains justify it and compensate for what you pay in a hefty tx fee.

IMO, you should just leave it in Bitcoin. It has a long way to grow. Definitely better off there than in a 529. If it made you feel better, maybe put 30% in 529 so you're diversified in case Bitcoin tanks, but you'd be way better off keeping it in BTC.

Most people have in the neighborhood of a few hundred dollars or so. IMO, a sticker, hat, mug, etc indicates "I have bitcoin to be stolen" about as much as driving to work indicates "I have a car to be stolen".

Yeah, check your settings. It sounds like you're set to "dynamic fees" which are probably setting your fees high enough to get confirmed quickly. It just means you're paying a big cut for every transaction. Not necessarily a bad thing if you want your tx going through, but don't be fooled into thinking it's magic or you're getting a free ride, you're paying that transaction fee you're probably just not realizing it on the receiving end.

I really don't mean to dismiss you as an idiot.
I have considered that you have a reasonable perspective, and after analyzing what I know of your perspective I've arrived at the conclusion that it is indeed unreasonable.
Even the language you use clarifies your unfair bias.


I only defend the truth. The truth that people are free, and people are free to willingly be manipulated into making purchases, willingly be manipulated into believing all corporations are bad, willingly manipulated into believing that if someone has more than they do that they should hate that person be envious of them believe that what they have was ill conceived, etc.
Not every corporation is inherently evil, and neither is every millionaire.


Unfortunately, I'm not in control of everyone else. I can care for them, and I can wish that oppressors stop oppressing, but I am only in control of me. But I **am** in control of me. I'm in control of whether I listen to the TV and take in the marketing, and I'm in control of whether I "walk into the store" or not.
But I don't believe it's my place to hate someone because they have more than I do. I don't believe it's my place to force anyone else to act a certain way or abide by some set of rules put in place by some arbitrary morality.

I think these moves boil down to the mindset that Bitcoin is a fad, or a bubble, and is going to go away so you'd better put your money somewhere "trustworthy". Somewhere where someone is keeping an eye on it for you. And in a form that's "backed" by some centralized power.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:15
People aren't giving you complete answers yet, so I'll give it a go.
In short, yes, you just paid $13 to spend $17.
There is an education curve currently. The technology is (relatively) new and its use is far from widespread and well understood. You've mainly just paid an "early adopter fee". It's ok.
As for the explanation, basically, the bitcoin network has capacity for, on average 200 transactions per minute. This is a simplification, but when you think of how many people there are around the world, this isn't very many!
Anyone can submit a transaction for inclusion. This means spammers can send millions of transactions to clog up the pool (this happened in November as part of an attack against Bitcoin). Part of the reason for a fee is to reduce spam. You wouldn't attack the network for $13 per transaction, right? You might, but you may run out of money pretty quickly.
Another reason for the fees is to incentivize miners. Miners do the work of building the blocks (for the blockchain) and thus including your transaction / confirming it.
Lately, Bitcion has received a LOT more excitement than it historically has. That means lots and lots of people are buying and selling. With so many people trying to participate in trades, that 200 tx per minute average fills up pretty quickly. Now you have a backlog! How do you prioritize the backlog? It's done by fee.
If you're a miner, you look at all of the transactions waiting, and you include all those paying the highest fee (because you, as a miner, get to keep all those fees).
Coinbase wants to be viewed as reputable, reliable, fast. So if someone says "Hey, make this payment in BTC", bitcoin has to issue a transaction on the blockchain. If there is already a big backlog and Coinbase pays a relatively low fee miners aren't going to pick up that transaction, it won't be processes, and whatever the account holder is trying to pay will be delayed. This upsets the customer and looks bad for Coinbase.
Coinbase's solution then, is to pay a fee high enough that it's confirmed right away. Rather, Coinbase has YOU pay the fee high enough to get confirmed right away. So they take a look at the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed and say, "How high do we need to set the fee for our customer so that their transaction is processed quickly". Unfortunately for you, that amount was ~$13.
Bitcoin is receiving more and more excitement and interest day by day. Truly, the days of &lt; $1 transactions might be gone. So in the day to day, you probably DONT want to be issuing transactions on the blockchain unless it's highly important and worth the fee, which may go down soon, but will in the long run just go higher and higher and higher.
You might think that this dooms Bitcoin, that no one is going to pay these outrageous fees. Well, first, people are paying them. If they weren't, the pool of unconfirmed transactions would start to dry up and fees would reduce. So in no way is this a risk to Bitcoin. As people start deciding, "Fees are too high", they won't pay them, and fees will go back down to a level where people will pay them. All indications point to Bitcoin fees being worth it though. Bitcoin and having transactions on the blockchain is SO valuable to people that they are willing to pay the $13 to make the transaction. There are some number of people like you who unwittingly paid it, probably a decently high percentage, but there are a lot of people (like myself) who gladly pay the fee when I need to move Bitcoin. Or I wait until I think fees will be lower.
You might think, "Well with fees this high, who can afford to buy coffee with Bitcoin?" Well, as you've so cleverly deduced, paying these fees for coffee is not very efficient, and in the long run you probably don't want to do this. You want to look around and begin reading about the *Lightning Network* if you spend any time on this sub, you'll see references to it. It's not ready for the primetime completely yet, but it will be, and it will enable inexpensive spending of BTC. This is (a piece of) the future, and once it starts getting used, you'll see exchanges and everyone else start using it. Then you won't be paying these high fees.
You're an early adopter, be happy about that, and get in as deep as you can now. Keep educating yourself, get a hw wallet, take people's advice, look into GDAX (Coinbase owns it, so you already have an account there), they're better about letting you withdraw your funds with low or no fee. They absorb the cost of the transaction fees rather than passing them on to you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:23:40
Yeah, I'm thinking the rescan has to go front to back, not really a process you can split among cores since the blockchain builds on itself. You can't really chop the blockchain into 4 pieces and do them on 4 cores since piece 4 depends on knowing the result of 3 depends on knowing the result of 2 depends on knowing the result of 1.

I feel like it's just a matter of generating a receiving address and giving the user a qr code. User pays, amazon waits for a confirmation  and completes order with a reference to the blockchain. I don't think they'd need any more integration than that.
Even refunds they could policy-wise say, "we just credit you your local fiat at the exchange rate at the time the btc transaction occurred" rather than try to fool with BTC
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:34:33
This would only be practical if there's collusion among miners. If you're a miner in possession of 10% of the hash power and your blocks contain 0 transactions your net result is reducing "supply" of transaction throughput by 10% and yes this results in increased fees, but as long as you're doing 0 transactions the other 90% hash power is receiving the benefit of that supply reduction and as long as you're not including transactions you're not realizing any gain from it. So unless the other miners are colluding with you and giving you kick-backs on the higher fees, you're not benefiting yourself by doing 0tx blocks.

Yes, unfortunately.
I would love to see a decentralized software which had a pairing mechanism. Basically LocalBitcoins rolled into the software. I'm imagining You open a limit order on BTC/USD and say "I'll buy 1btc for $17k" for instance, and you geotag your buy order with a geographic location (not your actual location, but this allows people to find buyers / sellers in their area) and a receiving address.
As a seller, you select that order, and you click "sell". And you and the buyer set up a meet and perform the transaction.
Yes, this has its limitations but I feel like it'd be better than local bitcoins and it is at least AN avenue people could use and compete with locally, and don't have to go through an exchange.
Plus, getting fiat into and out of bitcoin is only going to be difficult for another year, maybe two. After that I bet it'll be interchangeable with currency, you can put a percentage of your paycheck to a receiving address, etc. in any modern country. And / or banks will be able to convert it for you for a fee relatively easily, just like the forex market.

You don't get it. The whole point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anyone to follow rules. They follow software rules and that's all you're guaranteed.
If the miners all agreed, "Yes, let's do first come first serve", then one naughty miner would just disobey and gobble up the high transaction fee transactions and would be the most profitable miner.

Ok, I agree then.
This is what I was getting at with:


I still think this could look bad for Bitcoin, at least until there's good scaling reducing fees. People would go to pay for the product and it'd say, "Pay with BTC, price is 0.008, here is your fee slider and your confirmation time estimate". They'd see they're paying a $6 (or who knows) premium to get relatively immediate confirmation and start talking to their friends about how only idiots use BTC.
Of course, with scaling, and that fee being equivalent to a few cents, now it's not really an issue.

No, not really, read the [lightning network white paper]( and you should have an idea about how the security is not undermined.


As I type this, there are [roughly 120k transactions]( waiting to be included in a block on the blockchain. At a rate of [roughly 2000 tx per block]( we're looking at a 10hr backlog for the current transactions. That's assuming there are no transactions added over that 10hr period. This isn't good for anyone, not even for miners.
Ideally, Bitcoin transaction fees will normalize and settle at some relatively predictable level. i.e. .002 btc per byte. Different transactions have different sizes so it's best to think of it in terms of byte size to compute transaction cost. At this settlement level, if you need to expedite a transaction and guarantee it executes quickly you pay a bit of a premium, but by and large you pay the average, every block is full, but transactions aren't sitting in the pool for weeks on end.
This is the best of both worlds for all parties. You have expensive transactions, keeping miners profitable, and a reliable network that people know their transactions will be recorded if they pay a reasonably predictable fee. We're just not there yet.
But yes, I think the fees go WAY up to keep miners profitable, and we only use transactions when absolutely necessary (Like settling lightning network channels).

It's a combination of the FUD circulating and concerted attack again. I truly believe the BCash crew is at it again, just like the scam they played with 2x, they've been pumping BCash for 2 weeks, this is the "end game" (again), they've been fudding this sub and others as well as getting articles put out about Bitcoin's "unusable network" and "ridiculously high tx fees".
As BCash rises and BTC falls they'll wait until they know the time is right (they're already way ahead at current market prices so it's any time) and they'll decide to flip the switch, they'll put a lot of money back into BTC at the low prices selling off their pumped BCash back down to $1300 levels. Rinse and repeat, we'll be back here in a month or less having this same discussion and it'll happen over and over and over and over. Don't sweat it, just try to get in low if you can.
Also a really good time to just get in on the game, wait until you start seeing the tide turn a little, that's when you dump all of your BCH for BTC just like the crooks do.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:00:57
I think not though. I think Bitcoin weathered the CBOE launch well enough that CME is going to drive the price up further. If it were me and I was trying to decide when to buy, I'd put 50% in now, and then wait to see if I can DCA to a lower purchase point due to a dip, but don't count on it. You might end up DCA'ing up.
Either way, I think you're better off getting in before CME launch.

This would be a really stupid move for them. Owning all the BTC means no one else has it to do tx with, and therefore BTC has no utility, and therefore no value, so AMZN would have given all their product away for this now useless token.

I contend this is exactly why it would work, because people are incentivized to *not* have their trades fall through for benign reasons. When you put an order out there, you're serious about it.


This isn't a fundamental problem at all. This argument could be made about any private party trade. You meet someone to sell your XBOX, there's a risk that someone snatches it and runs. There's a risk that they hand you the cash and you leave with the XBOX and the cash.
The same with the private-party auto sales market. By your logic, the "fundamental problem" is that someone has to sign the title over and someone has to hand the cash over, whoever does their part of the transaction first risks being the loser, therefore there cannot be a private-party auto sales ecosystem. Which we know is completely wrong. The private-party market for ALL SORTS of assets exhibit this "fundamental problem", **and** those private-party markets are massively successful. This applies to local-bitcoins too, which you've already stated can work!
So I do agree, yes, there is risk as there is in any other private party market. AND you must do what you can to mitigate that risk AND know that you are still exposed to that risk to a degree. But this isn't unique to the fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto trade, it's just the nature of interacting with another person for any trade.

You might be right. Cost-benefit analysis may make it unprofitable for them to try to do.
However, if they did allow BTC payments natively, there are people with BTC who do want to spend it but don't have a good marketplace. These are people who *would* be buying things from AMZN using BTC who would not be making the purchase otherwise / aren't interested in spending USD.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:26:42
(1) Adding transactions is basically effortless computation-wise, so there is **NO** measurable benefit to doing this.
(2) Transactions have fees, so it's in a miners best interest to include transactions to receive those fees. Currently, a miner is looking at an extra ~3btc in fees alone, so miners definitely want to be adding the transactions to the block.

I have to believe that they know who it is. If he isn't dead or locked up, they probably have a keen eye on him and he knows it. probably playing it cool from here on out, again, if he's still alive.
It is pretty absurd that his early coins don't move, on any chain. Doesn't even bother cashing out chains he has no faith in? I'm not sure any human can have that much discipline. How long do you wait to take some gains? How long do you Hodl? No one lives forever...

I disagree that it's "necessary", BTC is going to survive and dominate without a bigger block. But, I don't disagree with you that a bigger block could be beneficial in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:47:47
I disagree. You're looking at what exists, not what could, or ought to exist.
I'm thinking a trustless software, similar to bitcoin, but probably not a public ledger passed around maybe closer to an IOTA-like tangle where you pay your peers to verify your trades.
With a new address in this tangle, I am imagining some sort of proof of stake necessary to issue a buy order, i.e. a "I'll pay X fiat for Y crypto". Basically, you have to run the app verifying trades or doing some amount of work that gets recorded in the tangle prior to allowing you to put in a purchase order. This is an intentional barrier to entry to weed out muggers and bad actors. It might even be some manual process that actually requires human attention / work, which sure could theoretically be performed by some bot or something but even that may be a significant enough effort it's a barrier to the majority of crooks placing purchase orders in fiat.
Now the buyer is allowed to place their buy-order and they're also committing their work / stake with that order, basically, if someone accepts their buy order and agrees to sell to them if that order fails to be honored the buyer / seller lose their stake, this is the incentive to honor your fiat buys and sells.
So as a fiat seller, you've placed your order and you've said "I will buy 1btc for 17k" and the software has generated a receiving BTC address for you, you are free to cancel this order until someone accepts it in case volatility makes you want to decrease your price or what-have-you.
A fiat buyer sees your order in the software, and decides they'll take you up on the offer. They click "buy USD for 1btc" and for them to do this, they have to have had the 1btc in their wallet already, ready to exchange, otherwise they'd be getting an "insufficient funds" response.
After the fiat buyer has clicked "buy 17k USD for 1 btc", the software creates a time-locked transaction locking up those funds.
Buyer and seller now have to meet and exchange the fiat. The fiat buyer once he has the USD in hand can select "release funds" and they go to the fiat seller, and you're done.
Assuming buyer and seller are unable to meet and perform the actual exchange, the time-locked funds go back to the original owner, the fiat stays with the fiat owner, and both parties simply lose their transaction stake they committed. That way it's costly, on some level, to have fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto exchanges fail.

I hope you're joking. BTC 1mb blocks are consistently full right now. I don't know for certain, but I think it's probably fair to suggest that &lt; 1% of participants in modern economies are participating in BTC.
Simple maths imply that an 8mb block should accommodate ~8x market participation. That means BCH will basically be where BTC is today *if* (very big if, only for hypothetical purposes) BCH gains dominance and has participation of ~8% those participating in modern economies.
Really? Is 8% market participation the "scaling" we're interested in?

This is great, but the degrees of separation are only meaningful in the context of the relationship.
People are only six / seven degrees separated because your typical person has many hundreds of "relationships". This level of separation will probably be infeasible on the lightning network because (1) there's a cost associated with each channel opening / closing, and (2) there's an opportunity cost of each channel, because the BTC you've committed to that channel is tied up there until the channel closes.
These factors **will** necessitate centralized 3rd party lightning hubs (aka banks?).

Bitcoin is *the* name in cryptocurrency, if something happens in Bitcoin, it affects every alt-market.
There is roughly half a trillion dollars in crypto.
If Satoshi moved coins, he could burn all his coins, or send them to a state power, or just start selling them off.
Any of these actions would disrupt half a trillion dollars worth of valuation and cause financial panic for a lot of people.
This is also someone who has created and kicked off a concept / software / ecosystem which has and will continue to completely change the financial system and world at large.
 Someone with this amount of power, yeah, every government wants to know who this is and how he can be used.

I think Roger and friends ride the pump and dump every time and they'll continue to do so. What actually puts an end to this though is that there are losers in these pump and dump cycles.
There will be a reckoning when the people who have gotten burned get disillusioned and out of the crypto-space, or at least out of a coin that pump and dumps so frequently.
Unfortunately there's a massive supply of new blood as people enter crypto, so a lot of people are going to continue to lose to the pump and dump while Roger and friends keep amassing more and more. I see it kind of as equivalent to BitConnect.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:43:24


You can buy some of it, it's finite though, you can't get satoshi's unless he sold them to you.


Does matter, you can't buy it if the seller won't / can't sell it.


There's no intellectual property in the open source bitcoin, but we're talking in the context of "why someone would want to find / know who Satoshi is", the property I'm referring to is what *else* he has.
Someone like this likely didn't just put down the keyboard and take the rest of his life off without cashing in any portion of the billions in assets you have. You don't just invent world-changing software and then hang up your hat. Maybe publicly you do (as he did) but in private, I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:05:03
Thanks for your analysis, and I largely agree with you.
However, even with LN, we still need on-chain transactions for opening and closing those channels. With the number of tx we *want* Bitcoin to support I anticipate the current block size is still too small for LN activity. 
I concede that bridge *could* be crossed when we reach it, but if we did a block size increase now I do believe it would alleviate some of the short-term congestion and I'm not sure I see a (technical) downside to increasing the block size. Storage and bandwidth are inexpensive enough I don't think that's a valid barrier to cite, and as technology progresses that issue is further and further reduced.

Yes. I have a few transactions created last week with low fees I was hoping would get through, but with all the excitement, they're just stuck in unconfirmed. I'm going to give it some more time and hope they go through eventually. If they never do, I'll probably try re-sending them with a high enough fee to get picked up. Theoretically if a miner gets my new transactions with the higher fee, they'll process the new one and if anyone ever sees the old one it'll just be rejected completely as a double-spend attempt.
And yes, a lot of software wallets will let you choose your own transaction fee.


Yes, hodl onto your BTC. It'll be worth more later anyway. You hear about a lot of people reaching their moon and cashing out. This is completely fine, especially if you have $1000+ worth of coin, paying the $13 isn't so bad on balances that high, but when $13 is more than 5% of your entire transaction you need to really want it IMO.
Be patient though, BTC is here to stay and as soon as real scalability arrives I think we'll begin seeing a lot of adoption and prices continue to soar. You'll be paying low tx fees and be able to spedn freely.

If this is really true, then things are the way they are and there is no changing that. "Bad" people couldn't have been any other way, so what's the sense in holding them accountable?
But those who want them held accountable also can't be any other way, so we can't expect anything different from them.
Global Warming and humankind's contribution to it is also inevitable, so is corporate greed and profiteering. Any ambition or desire or what appears to be "exercise of freedom" is not, and is futile anyway.

I really have zero experience buying from an ATM, but I assume the extra cost was the transaction fee.
Part of what makes Bitcoin "work" is that miners mine it. And part of miners incentive to spend electricity (and the cost of electricity) is "transaction fees" this isn't a fee the ATM is charging you, it's a fee you pay to do your transaction.
There is MASSIVE excitement surrounding bitcoin right now so the market has dictated high transaction fees, i.e. just to move money you have to pay that transaction fee, and it's in the $10-$25$ (USD) range as of late.
So the fees you're seeing aren't really unreasonable, it's the price of participating in the market, simple as that.
You would have to pay the transaction fee even if you were buying from a private party.
It does appear high, but it's just due to the excitement. The fees will calm down at some point. And even if they don't just keep an eye out for Lightning Network and that will enable very low fees in any case.
Yeah, it sucks to pay the fees, but seriously, it is completely worth it. Be happy you have control of your money and the fee is totally worth it.

Interesting theory.
I imagine at the very least 50% of BTC hodlers in August favor BTC over Bcash, and that's likely conservative.
Interestingly, apparently the BCH/BTC market isn't reporting. Out of curiosity I checked the "markets" tab on coinmarketcap to see what kind of volume there was in the BTC/BCH pair, and it isn't listed... I guess maybe it's just because coinbase still has their BCH trading turned off?
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens, especially considering BTC is discounted right now and BCH is way inflated.

(1) is your best option. You wouldn't be buying btc if you didn't believe its value would increase in the future. Hence, making a single purchase at the end of the month means you've lost any gain you could've had by buying weekly. So (1) is absolutely better than (2) in principle.
(3) This is an option, but unless you're a technical analysis wizard and have some ability to predict the future, this will not offer you any gains over (1) and will only frustrate and stress you out. You're going to think it's a dip, buy, and it'll dip lower and you'll be irritated, you're going to think it will dip, wait to buy, it won't and you'll be upset you missed out on a low you'll never see again. Every now and then you'll hit the dip just right and be happy with yourself. In the end your "good" buys and "bad" buys will even out, roughly. 
Your best bet is to buy as soon as you have cash in hand to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:47:12
(1) You might be right, and it could be miners doing this
(2) It also makes sense in conjunction with dragging their feet in segwit adoption.
(3) It doesn't really matter because people are only going to pay justified fees, i.e. if executing the transaction were NOT worth the $10 it cost to do so, you would not issue the transaction.
By definition, the fact that people are willing to up their fees to get above the spam explicitly means that the fees are worth it.
Theoretically, the miners would spam at higher and higher bands, pushing regular users to higher and higher fees. Eventually there will be an equilibrium and people will decide it's too expensive to move bitcoin, at this time all those miner tx spam are going to start getting processed, they'll begin losing money because they're paying out those tx fees to the other miners, etc.
So, this will reach equilibrium, and I think that's ok. Everyone is trying to learn exactly how to exploit the Bitcoin network to their fullest advantage, miners and exchanges and regular people alike. 
This is natural. Part of that "figuring it out" means we're going to implement ways to make it better (MAST), faster (LN), easier, etc. These things take time, but there's no need for panic, even when you hear "Bitcoin is dead because the tx cost too much"!

Of course. This is normal market forces.
If hashing power does not join, and there is still trade value in the coin, miners will join to earn themselves the block reward. If miners join making it unprofitable for some miners, the ones for which it is unprofitable will stop. And the ones that remain will net all the rewards. This will reach equilibrium pretty quick. But my point remains, it only takes one miner, and the fork will be mined.

10 years is so far in the future I don't know if we can meaningfully speculate. I mean, the whole cryptoverse could be changed. We might have quantum algorithms breaking various encryption and POW problems necessitating new currencies, new chains, etc. Just for fun, my guess is somewhere in the half-million dollar range, per bitcoin.
End of this year, $10k we're almost there.
The following is a copy / paste from another post explaining my speculation.
Any number and any date is always speculation, of course.
No one could've (reliably) predicted 2X would be abandoned, no one at the beginning of this year could've predicted BTC boom to where it is today.
My $10k prediction is admittedly **complete** speculation, and I make no claim to any substantive or quantitative indicators.
That being said, I think weathering this 2X shitshow is a very positive indicator for network / currency / community longevity. $10k by Christmas isn't exponential growth it's conservative and linear given incoming interest and onboarding.
IMO we have a boom ahead of us. There is plenty of money not in the Bitcoin market yet and market acceptance is at its VERY beginning and early stages. As Bitcion's name and reputation continue to improve, we're going to see an explosion. Right now, I think it'll be slow and steady linear growth until we hit that boom. The linear growth I think will have a good factor, i.e. allowing us to hit the $10k mark by Christmas, but within the next year I think we'll see the boom.
Right now probably less than 0.5% of people (people in developed countries with mature economies that is) own bitcoin. I think within the next year, MANY of those people will *want* bitcoin. That's **demand** and when we hit get there, that will trigger the explosion. Until then. Good linear growth. The community of hodlers see BTC at $7k and know it's a low valuation. As people earn fiat, they're putting it in BTC and will continue to do so, that'll keep us on this good linear growth to $10k.
Just a simpleton's prediction though.

(1) I never thought of it that way,,, but it's probably over 50% (Not that hard when your net worth is less than ~$8k)
(2) No
(3) Yes! Look at history. BTC is stupid volatile, and will probably hit 7.6k again. Be on the ready it won't stay there long.

At least you're saying something that's never been said before.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:56:57
Right, this is true for 2X too. You can speculate on the value and trade 2X as though the chain exists today. But you're not dealing with "real" coins yet, when you buy and sell via these exchanges it's all internal book keeping for them, nothing is happening on the blockchain.
This is actually true for BTC and other crypto trades too, until you withdraw / deposit coins, nothing is actually happening on the BTC network.
You could buy B2X or BTG, but if you tried to withdraw it, the exchange would give you some kind of error like, "This futures market is only for trading, and you can't withdraw it."
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:51:34
Yeah, price in terms of fiat for now. Eventually yes, price will stabilize and it'll make sense to price it btc, but we won't be there for at least a couple years.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:40:06
You won't lose anything. In fact, you'll have coins on two chains after the split, which is a good thing. See [this]( post and trezor statement. You'll have to educate yourself, but that's a good place to start to know what's going on.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:07:15
I mostly agree with you, most coins are garbage, but more than 3 will last. Your list is too small.
XMR, LTC, and XRP (in that order) will definitely live. XMR I think has a good chance of being  to BTC in the long run.
XMR definitely has a place, don't overlook it.

I haven't read the source, and need to take the time to validate your suggestion. But if you're right, this is really interesting.
The Clashic chain difficulty must be really high currently though, right? I mean, this fork was right at the time of The Great BitCHcoin War. So how long are we looking at for the adjustment? By that time BCH will be able to save itself I imagine by another HF rejecting any EDA chain blocks beyond the split.
TBH I'm not really excited about this happening. In a way it'd be deserved for some, but not for all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:48:55
Yeah, I think you're probably right. We're like that LHS graph. Very high demand and very low supply. We are absorbing that dead space right now.
That is precisely the market force which is driving *real* scaling solutions. Even quadrupling the block size is insufficient. Imagine you replaced your credit card purchases, cash purchases, and scheduled payments to bitcoin... Your transaction need would be FAR greater than a quadrupling. (I'm bring this up because of the recent 2X and BCH fanfare, and why those scaling "solutions" aren't solutions at all).
We are going to get more transactions AND it will be better for miners AND better for users. But these things take time. Then we have cut out a lot of that dead-weight.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:10:11
Scaling is one of the first steps. See the sticky video someone already mentioned.
Next, early adopters need to pave the way to make things easy for everyone else. Adopting coin payments doesn't make sense yet for a lot of companies, but once there are leaders that can teach others to do it efficiently it'll become common and mainstream.
With proper scaling, transaction fees will become negligible, and once there's an adoption path, it will make a lot of sense for a business to avoid credit card processing fees and use crypto instead. This will be a major catalyst.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:26:17
It's definitely up in the air. Bitcoin is getting more and more recognition every day. More people are introduced to it, more are learning and hearing the name.
It really is a better system though. Controlling your own money, not having to "get to the bank before it closes" when you need cash for a larger purchase, not having to carry that cash around with you, etc.
There are other outcomes besides the skyrocket and failing. In my opinion it's entirely possible we have a slow onboarding of new interest over the next year. People see bitcoin on big bang theory, or hear it on an npr story, or someone has a nephew or a sister who proselytizes. This would be a pretty normal organic slow growth of people being added to the pool. Absolutely, my personal friends would be receptive to me settling debt with them in Bitcoin, even the friends who don't know about it would be open to it so I am going to do things that way from here on out (my social life sucks so this won't be often), but I'm trying to make the point that it's not as far fetched as it was a couple years ago. People have heard the name and seen the price, it genuinely is *not* fake internet money anymore. And I don't think people think or argue that anymore.
Slow and steady growth doesn't fit the bill in my opinion though. I believe we'll see more and more adoption, faster and faster, we will have off-chain scaling solutions pretty soon, more and more merchants will adopt, there will be fanfare, and it will boom in 2018. That's what I think.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:57:15
Hmm, where to start...
Try looking at it this way. You've already realized your gains. You made a good investment and you've profited. You bought at a cost, on average of $3000, and now the value is ~$6500. That gain has already occurred.
So whether you convert it to $ or hold onto it, or buy a car with it or teddy bears, your net worth doesn't change. You've already received the benefit of the change in price, does that make sense?
Think of it this way. If someone is selling a car for a REALLY good deal and you buy it, once you've made the purchase, you've already made your gains. The question now is how to utilize those gains. Do you drive the car, putting miles on it and devaluing it (but receiving the value of transportation) or do you turn around and sell it to take profits? It truly does not matter because your gains were made (on that car) at the time of your purchase. Your BTC situation is slightly different, your gains weren't at the instant you bought BTC, *BUT* your gains are in the past. Now that your BTC is worth more, you own those gains.
The question you're asking is a question of optimal decision. Basically, you have some amount of money in BTC and you're wondering whether it's safe there. You're speculating a drop in the price and worried about a net reduction in your net worth. A real possibility, but it is really important to recognize that your past decisions, your acquisition costs, etc, absolutely should not factor in your decision on whether to buy or sell today.
As for your buy and sell limits, yes. If there's a dip and you can sell above your average buy price ($3k) and then re-buy back in at a lower price you've maintained your stake and made money. This is great, and lowers your average cost, but you run the risk of the price going just low enough to touch your sell limit and never reach your re-buy limit and skyrocket.
Do what you'll do, but you can simplify your decision by removing your acquisition cost from your calculations, they're irrelevant at this point. If you're confident there'll be a big dip any time soon, you can sell your holdings now, and re-buy the dip. I tried this once in the high $2000s, the market was really volatile and I thought to myself "What are the chances that this is the lowest price I'll see over the course of the next week?" I sold BTC, and I shit you not, it never went below that price. It was the tail end of a really volatile month and I had to buy back in at $3500. The lesson I learned is that it's better to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:40:32
gdax is coinbase's exchange, they won't charge you (or it's way more minimal) to transfer BTC to a wallet from there. Coinbase will charge you a withdrawal fee.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:55:36
This is a little hilarious to me because I have no idea what's in my RRSP. But I'm not trying to explain why RRSP isn't a scam either... In fact, I've been considering taking the penalty for withdrawing early to put it in crypto (don't tell my husband).

Send it to your wallet, what's the worst that could happen?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:28:31
As soon as 2X launches and you can get a 2X coin from somewhere, buy .001 2X coin from an exchange and deposit it to your 2X wallet. Now, make a transaction moving ALL of your 2X coins (those you had pre-fork plus the .001 you bought) to another address you own. This transaction can only be valid and included on the 2X chain. If that transaction is replayed on regular BTC it will fail because your sending addresses are missing that .001 BTC, basically insufficient funds and the BTC network will reject. After your 2X transaction with your sum of coins plus .001 B2X is confirmed, you're good to go and your coins are split.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:47:54
I don't have anything against Zcash, so I can't put it in my list. I am just ignorant to it. I don't see why not though, is there something in particular you think it offers that others don't or that it does better?
The reasons or the currencies I put,
XMR - Fungible and private
LTC - Fast cheap tx, very active (community and developer-wise), not corrosive (like some other bitcoin knock-offs), will be one of the first if not the first to do cross-chain activity with Bitcoin
XRP - I don't know all that much about it, but from the little I've read it's securing a place in already developed industries as a cross-border exchange medium.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:04
Definitely, we're in a nice dip. It could go lower, but if I were you I'd buy 75% now, and hold 25% out hoping to get in at $7.2k.

Excellent price. I wish I'd been able to jump on that price.
Yeah, of course it's all speculative, but I agree with you with the defeat of Bcash and 2X we're in for a run, or a continuation of the run that was occurring before that attack. I see us at $8k by end of month and a continued bull run to $10k by nye. I was convinced of this before 2X was cancelled and before Bcash attack. Now, I think it's a shoe-in and CME is only going to help.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:02:48
Yeah, I have to defend Coinbase here. They were bad actors to be signed on to 2X, but it's a matter of making money to them. They can be blamed for this, but it's at least understandable.
As for the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. As others have said, Gold isn't even live yet, so they couldn't really give it to us if they wanted.
Bitcoin Cash they probably could, but trying to ramp up support for another chain and product isn't just the flip of a switch, they decided to support it, and kindly are willing to give us our BCH (which they aren't actually obligated to do in the first place) in January. They made a calculated decision to put it out until January and that's that.
Yes, I agree, they probably put off BCH delivery to consumers to January because they wanted to sell of their BCH at today's prices and buy it back to give to their customers when it's nearly dead in January, but to expect them to be able to support it today is not fair to them it's just not realistic.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:53:24
Yeah, these fees are crazy.
I just dropped over $7 and it's been sitting at 0 for hours. Kind of awesome. I mean, people are willing to still trade despite the attack. This storm will be weathered.

I have to stop myself from writing a book after listening. 
But here are my 2 satoshis:
I hope some people who have never heard of Bitcoin were exposed. This is always good.
Please listen to the story / interview yourself. Don't take my word for it. My opinions are my own informed by my own bias.
It completely pisses me off that every journalist's story covering Bitcoin HAS to start with something like the following:


When will that nonsense end... Probably never.


The connotation of a statement like that implies such a distrust and distaste for liberty. People like this are just begging for a power structure (government) to enforce a way of life. Ick, it makes my skin crawl.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:59:30


Even people in the crypto-space don't think broadly enough, everybody's trying to pick the next winner, and once they sign on to their pick to hell with other coins / cryptos.
That way of thinking is so damn silly. There isn't just one "winner" website that everyone uses, no, you use different websites for different purposes. Bitcoin doesn't need to be Turing Complete, just like Microsoft doesn't need to have a search engine. Stick with what you're doing well.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:01:10
Yeah, securing your bitcoin is going to be a big deal for the mainstream. Hardware wallets seem kind of cumbersome for mainstream to adopt, but regular people who aren't thinking about security are going to get screwed over, and over, and over, and I have a feeling it'll be worse than it is today with credit cards and such. I guess the price of being trustless. You own the keys and its yours, no one to dispute it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:15:56
The important thing is that if you have control of your private keys and the fork occurs, you're good to go. It'll take some research and understanding and work to cash them out, but as long as you have control of your keys you'll be ok.
If they're in an exchange or anywhere where someone else is managing your keys for you and you don't have sole access to them, they're at risk.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:40:48
Xfer money to your account. Make trades for coins when  they're undervalued. When the value goes up, trade them for other coins that will go up. Rinse and repeat, if you do this you are literally guaranteed to make money so long as you've made enough to cover any transaction / deposit / withdrawal fees.
Or just buy BTC and let it sit. That might be your best option.
Good luck friend.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:33:09
2X has in a way already failed. Its price on the futures market is a clear indicator. Even miners signaling support won't mine an unprofitable chain.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:33:18
IMO there is absolutely no advantage to buying something which bases its value on bitcoin, but is not bitcoin.
If you buy bitcoin directly, you might have to pay a fee to acquire it if you use an exchange, and a bitcoin network fee, but then it's yours no one can take it away or take monthly or annual fees out of your holding or deny you access to your account because their site went down or sell your information to 3rd parties or get hacked and broadcast your SSN and other personal information to bad guys or tell you your account has been frozen because who knows why, or locking you out because you forgot your password, or .......
Own Bitcoin, and own your private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:34:19
I read this as **no risk** until there's real weight behind clashic. I mean, 99% of BCHers aren't going to care that their transaction was replayed on a meaningless chain. If someone goes and downloads the source of BCH and mines their own chain in their apartment, you're not really concerned if they're replaying your transactions.
It would be kind of cool if Clashic kept going though and eventually made it onto exchanges and into coinpayments and stuff. But probably not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:33:43
It is definitely wrong to think that it's a zero sum game. That is not at all how the world, or economics work. 
One persons gain does not equal another person's loss.
Imagine this, you spend all of your time growing corn. Another person spends all their time milking cows. You have more corn than you can eat, and they have more milk than they can drink. When you trade, you both gain. Not zero sum. No, BTC isn't corn and it's not milk, but the illustration is only meant to convey that one person's gain is absolutely not necessarily another person's loss.
That being said, of course some people have lost money in crypto and BTC. But that's **not** because it's a zero sum game.

Unfortunately, the feds make the rules here, and you can expect the following:
"Sir, according to &lt;exchange&gt; you made a purchase of 1btc prior to the fork, making you the owner of 1bch. This was an income of $700. You need to pay taxes on that money, here is your bill."
Now it's on you to prove that you DIDN'T receive the bch. Yes, technically, IF you go to court you might win **if** there's no record of you receiving your bch, but if &lt;exchange&gt; indeed credited it to your account and there is record of that, you're probably screwed.
**if** you withdrew your bitcoin to a personal address from your exchange account prior to the fork, the feds will still assume you controlled those coins (they can see the address you withdrew to), and if there's any movement on that address on the bch chain, at the time of movement they'll say, "We assume this was your sale of bch, where you took gains, prove to us that it wasn't you".
This is a game they'll win.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:54:49
Yes. This whole situation doesn't really need to strike fear into people. If you had confidence in Bitcoin a week ago, nothing has occurred that reduces favor for Bitcoin. It's dominance and strength have only increased.
The uncertainty in the crypto-ecosystem as a whole has gone way up because we *thought* 2X was going to be this corporate takeover attempt. Then we *thought* it was canceled. Now I *think* we're waking up to the idea that it's not as dead as we thought. This uncertainty screws with people.
Yesterday, Bitcoin dipped to $7300, I think that was a natural out-flow of the alts that have been coming in to Bitcoin recently in anticipation of the fork. In my opinion, that was the bottom of that sell off. What you're seeing today, the drop to $6800 and maybe below in the coming days, I'm thinking that's this uncertainty speaking. I'm buying as low as I can get it.
2X wasn't going to win when it had "full" support from its supporters, it's not going to survive now that it's been "cancelled". The same for BCash, you're seeing a rally now, but BCash has been around since August. If it were the winner it would've won by now.
Maybe, just maybe there's room for these alts alongside Bitcoin, but fear not, they're not displacing or replacing it. Bitcoin is going to continue its market dominance. I think we'll hit $10k by Christmas, and within 2 years $50k.

It doesn't have to oppose your morality. My description of the scenario was only to follow your proposition of a "worst-case scenario" with a bad actor.
In practice, no one needs to get burned.
If you indeed buy 2X coins from an individual and their transaction is replayed on BTC network, then there are three possibilities, the first is that you're aware of it, and you say "hey, you sent me a BTC as well, that was dumb" and give it back. The second is that they don't know, no one is the wiser, and that coin just ends up burnt indefinitely. This is waste, but not so bad, no ill-intent and no one knows they had a loss, so no harm really. Finally, you're a bad actor and you keep their BTC they accidentally sent you. Yeah, that final one should not fit your sense of morality.
The common case, and the case I described, is that you're interacting with a company that knows what they're doing. You give them fiat, or BTC, or LTC, or whatever you want, and they send you a 2X coin via a non-replayable transaction. For companies in the crypto-space attempting to support 2X, they're probably not going to get burned by these types of replays. They just need to follow the same process I described (and there might even be a better / easier one that I don't know because my stake isn't that big and I'm not trying to support the 2X chain in my existing infrastructure).
You'll ask, "Well, where did they get their 2X coin non-replayed in step (2)?" They can get it directly from a 2X miner. They assuredly have these types of connections and they say, hey, send me .01 B2X (or even .000001 B2X) that was actually minted on the 2X chain and therefore is completely invalid on the BTC chain. Then they can continue the rest of the steps and be guaranteed to split their coin.
They probably have other ways of doing reliable splitting early on too.
I'm imagining a major miner specifically offering this service and they say something like "Hey, Exchanges, send me transactions which exhibit characteristics X, Y, and Z, and for a fee I'll prioritize these specific transactions in the blocks I'm mining, BUT! don't include an actual transaction fee in the transaction itself, that way no sensible BTC miner will include it in there block."
Now once those "special" transactions are confirmed on the 2X chain, the exchange can send contradicting transactions which will be rejected by 2X, and accepted by BTC chain, and again we have a split. Of course, this theoretically could be done without having a "special" deal with a miner and without "special" transactions, this could be accomplished by just broadcasting various transactions across both networks and hoping the networks include different transactions in their blocks (which would absolutely happen, it's just a matter of time), and then you'd be split.
But you're right, as an every-day joe, people need to be careful I posted [this PSA]( a while back, unfortunately it didn't get much attention. People will get burned.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:23:56
Won't be a big problem going forward since Bitcoin are highly divisible, and a fork could make them more divisible over time if necessary. They're just gone, and people learned a hard lesson and served as an example to the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:37:31
I do think this is good news. For anyone to reliably offer trades, they **will** be buying and holding real BTC as collateral for those offerings. Another market application moves us toward wider acceptance.

Forks can be canceled, this should factor into your decision on whether to buy or not.


This is wrong. If you flip a coin 3 times and it lands on heads 3 times, your odds of landing on heads for the next coin flip is not 100%. Your "statistical" argument is completely wrong.
I was by no means saying the odds of a shark attack are in any way comparable to the odds of a fork not coming into existence. My statements made no such argument. Your suggestion that they did is a straw man fallacy. You're pretending I suggested something ridiculous and then pointing out how ridiculous it is, when I didn't state that at all.
I'll simplify my argument for you.

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:31:29
That's pretty cool. The barrier to entry is still an issue. It's intimidating to a lot of people to set up the account and give PII and buy coins.
I'm a big fan of having crypto on-hand to sell off to interested people. They absolutely need the guidance to realize that they're in sole control though and they can't get it back if they lose it or send it to the wrong address or drop their phone in the toilet without having the passphrase. Not having a custodian of your money really scares a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:45:02
Yeah, it only takes one miner, and the coin is already on exchanges. And if you look at the price charts, there are still bids in on 2X coin. If it were completely dead, price would be zero.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:26:29
It's up in the air IMO. Maybe with Lightining Network type solutions we'll have a way to transact inexpensively. But the market might keep bitcoin the way it is, and move it toward a store / high-value infrequent transactions rather than a day-to-day currency.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:05:41
Ok, interesting. Where are you seeing the ~7 blocks since fork? and where do you see the difficulty?
My interest is definitely piqued.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:14:01


I think it will. We'll have things like off-chain scaling that do off-chain work and then commit a transaction to the bitcoin blockchain settling those transactions.
So users will accrue it by their transactions being faster and cheaper, and miners will accrue it because the off-chain solution will pay a hefty fee to get it's book-keeping transaction onto the bitcoin blockchain. This maintains very high bitcoin transaction fees for miners AND reduces day-to-day transaction fees for regular users.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:38:53
Fungibility and privacy.
Right now, imagine you have a BTC address with 10 BTC in it. Now imagine a bad actor has stolen coins in some blacklisted address. They send you 1 BTC (maybe you did a real transaction with someone and didn't verify they were paying you from a non-blacklisted address or some address downstream from a blacklisted address). Now your coins are blacklisted and can't be deposited to an exchange or anywhere else that is checking blacklisted chains / addresses. See [my comment on another thread]( This should be concerning to any bitcoin holder. Even though blacklisting addresses is uncommon, it might become more common, and unless you have software verifying your payer upstream, you could get screwed.
From the privacy perspective. When you buy coins from an exchange, your name is associated with that transaction clearly. Maybe not to everyday people, but if the exchange's records are hacked or if a nasty government commandeers or subpoenas them, yes, your name is tied to those addresses. It follows that any downstream activity you, at the very least, have a probable connection to.
Imagine you withdraw coins from an exchange, and then withdraw again to the same address a year later, now there is real evidence that you still own that address and are responsible for any transaction "outs" between those two periods. This also circumstantially demonstrates the fact that you don't make payments straight from the exchange but that you do hold your own addresses to withdraw to. It doesn't sound important, but it shows you have the technical prowess to host your own wallet and maintain it, etc. It means that if there are any *other* addresses you've withdrawn to, from the exchange, when that address is proved to have been used for purchasing something illegal, there's already a proven track record that you transfer from exchange to your own addresses, so you probably own that address. Right, it's circumstantial, but after a while the little details add up. Transaction times of day, amounts, frequency, etc etc.
If someone is determined they can pursue ISP logs and find where the transaction originated from, etc, etc.
XMR is vulnerable to some of these meta-datas, but it is MUCH better in that it does not show your account balance, does not show how much money is being transferred, etc. It is MUCH MUCH more private.
A lot of people say, "Well, that's fine for someone who wants to participate in illegal activity, but I don't, so I'm safe." This is only valid until whatever you *DO* do is deemed illegal. In the relatively more free countries this is less of an issue, but even in US or EU countries, in coming years it's going to be viewed very "unfair" that some people have high value addresses that just sit there and keep that money away from doing good in the economy, etc, etc, it's unfair for you to have it in the first place, let alone let it sit. Eventually you'll need to pay a Crypto-dormancy tax or something, and if you don't they'll blacklist your address. In XMR your balance is unknown.

That's Bitcoin Gold. I actually really like the idea and hope they succeed, but their launch hasn't been seamless, and the market doesn't look too great. Time will tell. For now I think I'll hodl onto my gold coins, and see if they gain any market acceptance.

I agree. Looks like BCH would've been a good buy, what do you think's going to happen there, do you think BCH is really making a run for dominance, or are people flocking to BCH to later convert to BTC (by later I mean pre-fork still)?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:10:03
Personally, I don't really like exchanges knowing how much BTC I have. When you transfer it in, they credit you B2X, and you do what you will with it and transfer back out there is a clear record of those transactions, plus when you make your deposit to the exchange you're linking your sending address to your identity. Hopefully you're ok with anyone knowing about your transaction history. If all of these privacy freebies you're giving away are worth it, then yeah just put your coins in and let the exchange do the split for you.
I'm going to attempt the following:
(1) Download 2X software and import my private keys. My B2X should be reflected, for instance addresses A and B had BTC pre-fork, now they have (for example) 1 B2X coin total (address A and B summed value).
(2) Acquire some 2X ASAP from Shapeshift or some other relatively anonymous source. Even just .01 B2X and deposit it to my wallet to address C, alongside addresses A and B.
(3) Now that wallet has 1.01 B2X, and I'll send all 1.01 B2X to my own receiving address D.
(3.1) The transaction sending to D in step (3) is only valid on the 2X chain since the transaction includes coins from addresses A, B, and C, where C does not have coins on the BTC network. So this transaction will be rejected on BTC network, but will be accepted on B2X network.
(4) Addresses A and B can now safely be sent to E on the BTC network, and now I'm completely split. I've got my 1 BTC coin from addresses A and B now safely exclusively in address E on the BTC chain and I have the corresponding 1 B2X coin from addresses A and B along with the 0.1 B2X coin from address C successfully split into address D exclusively on the B2X chain.
(5) Send the 1.01 B2X shitcoins in address D down the drain and exchange for something worthwhile. FAST, before they go to zero.

I made a post for this, but maybe mods removed it, so here it is in a comment.
I haven't heard much talk on it. I've made comments on a couple posts and they haven't gotten much response. But I'll give you my opinion since you're asking.
First, the 2X codebase is out [there]( so in a way, the cat is out of the bag.
We also know that there are [2x nodes]( up and running. We also know that a number of people [**bought**]( 2x futures and have a serious vested interest in seeing the fork occur. If it doesn't occur, their 2x futures go to zero, literally, if it does occur, they may be &gt; 0. Look at the [futures market]( now. As I type this, those future coins are trading at almost $400, people are **still buying** these future coins at these prices.
Remember, it only takes one miner to mine. Literally, you or I could sit on the network and mine 2X, and if we were the ONLY miner, eventuallly we would mine a block, the fork occurs, we get the block reward, 12.5 coins at even $300 is $3750. Granted you'd be mining them slowly because difficulty is high, I won't get into that. My point is that as long as that futures market is alive, that coin is alive. If a miner with power decides to mine that coin, and even if they're only mining them at 10% efficiency, i.e. not every 10 minutes, but say every 100 minutes, you're still looking at $54,000 per day in block rewards.
Finally, this is a little more cynical of me. But suppose the 6 people responsible for the 2X fork cancellation sold all of their BTC leading up to their announcement. They're selling at nice high prices, i.e. ~$7500, maybe as high as $7,800. They hoped for a bigger dip after the cancellation news and didn't get it, but they've now bought BTC at ~$7300. More importantly, they sold all their 2X futures at prices in the $1400-$1800 range, where it was before the cancellation announcement. Then they took all of this profit and went to the alt-coin market and bought up tons of whatever, who cares it ALL went up yesterday (basically). They made their announcement and cashed in big on the alts. Finally, after 2X futures crashed down to $150, they bought back in big. Now they've already turned another massive profit on those, as it's up to nearly $400 now. **AND** their network is going to go live. Really, though immoral and they scammed a bunch of people, this is not stupid. Especially if they really think 2X will win out in the long run. (It would be so crazy if they were right) now that everyone in the BTC community has completely let their guard down thinking they've won.
Just remember that there is an ecosystem of nodes running 2X live on the network RIGHT NOW. And keep in mind that it only taks **ONE** miner to mine a block and begin the fork. And, that futures market shows that the coin has value today when *no one* believes it will exist at all! How much more value will it have when it actually exists?
I am completely surprised that I, literally, am the only person I've seen speculating this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:33:19
IMO it's all fun and games. 95% of us don't have enough to begin with to make life-changing gains. My guess is, 95% of us have less than an entry valuation of $2k in the market. 
Even if average entry was at a BTC price of three thousand (which it's probably not nearly that low for the average person), for those with an initial stake of $2k are looking at current gains of ~$6k total.
Yes, this is much better than holding cash, or stocks or gold, but you're looking at a 2002 Camry rather than a Tesla.
"To the moon" sounds great, but even when BTC hit's $50k, that's a gain for people with this stake of ~$35,000. Yes fantastic gains, but you likely can't retire on it. It's just fun to pretend you're getting rich and to get something for nothing.

Various US agencies assuredly already own bitcoin, so in a way the likelihood is 100%. I guess you'd need to pose the question differently. 


Had you asked that question, I think the probability is very high. Maybe not this year (but probably). In the long run, nearly 100%, at least 85%.
The US is pretty unlikely to ban bitcoin. First off, what would that mean? Would it be a law restricting its use? US citizens would be outraged (This isn't something the current administration would be interested in anyway). Would a ban just be a verbal ban? or a restriction on exchanges? 
Any of these I think is pretty unlikely. Maybe 25% chance anything like this happens.
Regulation on the other hand is already in process and "regulated to the point of crippling peoples use of it", I think that will be attempted but thankfully due to decentralization and the relatively high level of freedom the US enjoys it probably can't be crippled. If they do this quickly though, they might stifle adoption in US, and that might prevent Bitcoin from reaching the same heights it would otherwise.

Sure, you still own your coins on both sides of the fork, but you haven't gained anything. They're both still at the same address and therefore both still vulnerable to replay. So you're out tx fees AND you've gained absolutely nothing.


This is the real key thing you're missing. It doesn't take a specific person or a bot to do the replay. It's not some bad actor sitting and watching the network and replaying the transaction personally (this could happen, but it's not a requirement for replay to occur).
Rather, when YOU or anyone else executes a transaction on the network, it can be replayed by default, by the network / nodes / software itself. Becuase 2X and regular BTC nodes are on the same network and they will send transactions to one another by default, so your transaction can and may be executed without any bad actor, just the way the software works. So it doesn't have to benefit anyone for the replay to occur, it's just a matter of chance / whether your transaction fees were high enough to get on both chains.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:39:15
If there's value in those coins, a miner will mine the chain, and yes, there will be a fork. I think things are a bit more devious than just "miners still intending to fork" though.
Not intending to hijack, but [here]( is my post on the same topic with a lot of good discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:52:06
You may be right, but I kind of think not. Do you have any source or math to back up this claim? I mean, basically, block reward plus transaction fees has to sum to less than the power cost + opportunity cost to mine a block for it to be unprofitable.

Nations using coins I think is inevitable. They're a lot cheaper and more reliable than paper money, you can't counterfeit them. These would be centralized, that's not a problem.


Yes, but not of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community is pretty dead-set on decentralization. If Bitcoin becomes centralized, this is a scenario where "something better than Bitcoin could pop up"
In fact, we have really decentralized cryptos already, so those of us who valued decentralization would just migrate to another coin. But as of right now, I run a full node, and will for as long as I am able to store the whole blockchain.
IMO (and most others on this sub at least), Bitcoin is king, and Bitcoin is here to stay. It's a good place to put your money, and ideally you won't have to ever convert back to fiat. There are scaling solutions coming to life that will make it realistic as a day-to-day currency.

This wasn't a mistake at all.
2X crew didn't ever want 2X to succeed, BCash was the game plan all along and they made hundreds of millions at least.
If 2X ever did actually go live, it could only have hurt BCash. At least some portion of BCash market share and hash power would've bled over to 2X they knew they couldn't let that happen so this was the failsafe.
All of a sudden [this bet]( doesn't look so stupid for Roger Ver. He knew he couldn't lose. 2X as written couldn't be mined at all.

I think it's going to really hurt the community if people feel like they get shafted by consequences of this fork.

$5500 is not out of the question at all. TBH, nothing is out of the question. $2000 isn't out of the question. But any of these prices severely undervalue it. I'd say buy a little now in case it doesn't go much lower. When it goes lower, buy again, and again, and again. That's what I'm doing. I don't mind eating the fees because Bitcoin already defeated BCH in August. Bitcoin defeated 2X recently (yeah it'll still launch, but it's dead don't be fooled). Bitcoin has longevity and it's only the excitement and BCH's run that has it down right now. Buy buy buy.

Right, but this is old nodes. So if this scenario actually unfolded, at worst some portion of old nodes follow the old consensus.

Sucks to be them, but no harm done to regular BCH holders. Right?

The more you're educated, of course, the more informed your speculation. It's still speculation though.
That's nice that you're willing to lose your money, I really do believe in Bitcoin, and the way it's shrugged off this 2X attack so far is a testament to its longevity, but despite all that it's still somewhat of a gamblers game in my opinion. But then again, the stock market IMO is too.
Be careful with the alt coins. Don't jump into stuff. Read through what they're about and what their community is doing. There are a few with great ideas, ambitions, and communities. I think the rest will fizzle.
Here's the way I look at it. Put in what you can afford to lose / live without. Hodl it until you turn a profit. If you never do, damn, but you will. Once you turn a profit, decide when the time to realize those profits is, and stick to that. Don't be greedy. When the time comes, cash out at that level and you're already way ahead, you made an investment that turned out good. Now, decide whether to put any of those realized gains back in. 
Even if you lose it all, since you're working only with "gains" now, you're no worse off than you would've been if you'd never heard of the crypto-market. With your gains you should now feel comfortable taking risks, playing alt-markets, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:39:41
Just because it turned out bad *this* time doesn't make it prescriptive. Just because it turns out bad *most* of the time also doesn't make it prescriptive.
To categorically say "Never EVER buy futures of a fork" is just naive. It's equivalent after someone gets attacked by a shark to say "Never EVER swim in the ocean". No, swimming in the ocean has its associated risks, as does everything else.
How about, "Only buy futures of a fork when you've deemed it a worthy investment, and realize the fork might not occur and you may lose money if you bought."
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:14

I think you're nuts. If this were true they never would've canceled it. I think we will get 2x, I almost wonder how we possibly could NOT get it. Especially with those futures holding value. If no one else is mining 2X by that time, I will.

In short, you probably just don't understand what makes Bitcoin valuable.
There is value today. Today, it is a place to store value where you control it. A bank can't lock access or be hacked to lose your funds and a government can't stop you from issuing a transaction (assuming you have bitcoin, access to the network, etc). Basically, it is true economic liberty.
Beyond that, there are a million applications of this liberty. Including the transfers (even with high tx fees, for large sums this is an inexpensive way to transfer wealth), it is deflationary making it a good store, it is still relatively private. No it's not a privacy-crypto and if someone wants to find out what you're doing they can, but you can make a transaction that's not going to show up on a credit card statement in the mail, etc.
Finally, it has potential. Aside from the benefits Bitcoin has today, most of us how hodl have a deep belief in the technology itself.
Back to transaction fees for a little more on that. Transactions on the bitcoin network are a limited resource. Supply and demand set the price and there is very high demand right now. Bitcoin is SOO valuable that people are [willing to pay]( $60 just to move coins from a wallet to an exchange. Bitcoin transactions maintain this value amid attacks and lacking widespread adoption by every-day people. Transactions will get less expensive someday, but the fact that people are willing to pay so much to move bitcoin around today just shows you how much more valuable bitcoin will become when it **is** cheap to move around.
Congrats on taking profit. I would never fault anyone for that and at some point we all have to get utility OUT of our Bitcoin, otherwise, what was it for? For a lot of us though, we have a vision for the future that justifies hodling, justifies high transaction fees, justifies buying and hodling and buying more.
I actually sell too. I sold just the other day at $6.2k and I never look back. I've already bought back more than what I sold, but I did sell. And I'll do it again, and I'll buy with BTC.
I will say that you made the right decision. If you don't understand or don't believe it has anywhere to go but down, by all means sell high and take profits. I predict you'll be buying back in in the future though, whether buying directly from a person or exchange, or accepting bitcoin for a good or service I expect you to be a BTC holder in the future because that's the way the world is moving. I genuinely think it will be a fascinating story for your kids and grand kids to know that you owned and sold bitcoin at $6k it will be just unbelievable that it was ever worth so little.

You ever see that lady at the grocers paying by check. It's like, you want her to learn to use a debit card, but its what she's used to.
You're looking at Bitcoin like a stock. When it goes up, great, but it can't go up forever right? Is this the end? You might sleep easier with your money in stocks.
Bitcoin can be treated like an investment, and if you hold onto it you will make money because it's going to be massively more valuable in a few years. But if you don't understand why you probably won't be able to stomach the ups and downs.

I also have a late 30's relative in IT who did know the name and some of the tech but had little interest which REALLY surprised me too.
We are definitely early. I had a coworker recently ask whether I would divest my Bitcoin holdings after the recent bull run. "How can it go higher?" was his position, to which I replied, "How did it get this high in the first place? That's how it gets to $100k too."
Which is scoffed at, but I believe it.

"Bitcoin Visa Card" is just a named Visa card, just like if you got a "Panda Visa Card" or a "Nascar Visa Card". You're no more *paying with bitcoin* with your Bitcoin Visa than you are *paying with pandas* with your panda Visa.
That being said, I do have to say that there is a possibility that this kind of thing can be beneficial. For one, it puts bitcoin in people's mouth. 
Whether they're *really* using bitcoin or not, someone can pat themselves on the back for thinking they are, and that adds to name recognition and legitimacy even if it's not true. Likewise, when people see a name like Visa associating itself with bitcoin, this is absolutely a legitimization of the Bitcoin as a product / name brand. This is clearly a good thing, as silly as the whole concept is.
Finally, this is also another market inclusion of Bitcoin. These types of accounts / debts / funding **are** actually settled using bitcoin. These are transactions that do take place on the blockchain and are yet another service someone can buy with bitcoin. Every time the market adds one of these it is a good thing for Bitcoin. Whether it's a debit account situation or the bank actually shows users "Hey you owe us .046 btc" on their statement, this means that the user has to either pay their balance, or fund their account with actual BTC. That means those people have to get it from somewhere, which means they are willing to part with other goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin so they can pay this debt / fund this account. This is good news for the Bitcoin eco-system.
I do get 's frustration. I've had it before too because the people using these services really don't get it. But I've resigned that frustration and replaced it by looking at the bright side of this kind of news.

Also, I don't think this is accurate. I looked all over for exchanges which would allow a "short" on 2X, and I couldn't find a single one anywhere.
I also have accounts with multiple exchanges and attempted shorts (and even had BTC in my trade account which could have acted as collateral if need be), but none of the exchanges I tried allowed it. Shorting 2X was not a thing.
You're probably wondering "then how did they ever even have a market?". I couldn't actually find any documentation or reference for this either. 
But, my only guess is that the exchanges did what exchanges do and they basically thought to themselves, well we have X BTC and we're guaranteed to have that in B2X if the split actually occurs, so let's go ahead and open a market, we'll deny anyone trying to perform a sell order (like I did) and we'll see where the market goes on the buy orders. Once we have a good gauge on the price people are willing to pay, let's sell all of our B2X future coins to those people. As these buy orders start getting executed, people see the market start to move, and one person who indeed bought a future can sell at a higher price after 15 min, great, he does it and sells the future he actually owned (this is not a short, or an open position, he's actually selling his tangible future). The buyer is happy with their account showing some amount of 2X coin in it, and then price starts tanking, they get fearful and sell at a loss, market continues to move. I'm pretty confident this is exactly what happened. If someone can correct me with a documented reference of short selling 2X I'm happy to be corrected (but sad I missed out on the opportunity). But I'm not wrong either.

It's going to dip, LOTS of people want to re-diversify back into alts. You *could* sell now, but that's a gamblers game. My strategy is to buy the dip. If it dips to $7k or below I'm buying in. Any subsequent downward milestone, i.e. every $250 it falls further, I'm buying more. BTC may (or may not) dip in the short term, but within 2 weeks it will be back where it is today in the mid $7k range, and $10k by Christmas. You can speculate and try to sell now and buy back in a little lower, but you're better off hodling what you have and buying the dip also.

I did a few transactions within the last few days at under sixty US cents. That's not bad, but I agree they don't qualify as "small".
The "tx fees rise" I was referring to was not on the scale of $1 or $10 though it is going to get much more expensive to do on-chain transactions I'm thinking it'll be in the hundreds of dollars for a transaction, easily.
As we continue to see adoption fees will continue to rise and we'll have to move tx off-chain if we want to scale and maintain a decentralized currency, that's just fact.
Those fees will be maintainable because we'll have other products / services / layers on top of bitcoin and those will be paying the exorbitant fees for the utility of using the Bitcoin chain. Everyday people will be paying very low fees to the off-(bitcoin)chain products enabling high transaction throughput etc AND maintaining the high value to mining Bitcoin.

Mmmm, maybe. I think even the best coin mixing has its limits. At the very least I think you're paying a high price for it especially as tx fees rise in bitcoin which I think is inevitable. Whereas if you just use XMR you don't incur any of that risk or price taken off the top.
Not saying it's impossible to mix and be safe, but inconvenient at the very least. Kind of like using a console-based text-only web browser. It's doable, but we have good graphical browsers that are much better for looking at, erm,,, graphs.
The console is great, but we have other tools for other purposes. Let the other tools have their place and use them when appropriate.

As long as you control your own keys you'll be able to get your 2x coins (eventually, and with effort). Putting them in coinbase lets coinbase do the split for you, which is nice, and then you can sell / trade / etc easily. This is probably a good option for you.
Personally, I will do the split myself manually by importing my keys to a 2X wallet.

Bitcoin is the leader here. It seems like for some reason people think BCH might take over, but it didn't take over in August, why would it now? And why BCH, what does BCH have to offer LTC doesn't?
No, the last 2 weeks have been a big game because 2X was defeated. It will pass and Bitcoin will forget about it. Mark my words, if you sell, you'll regret it within a month. Instead, buy.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:40:25
Yeah, give it time, it still might go through. The fee the transaction paid was probably just too low and the transaction may need to be re-sent. Hopefully you have a way to get a hold of the person who sold it to you, they'll need to re-issue the transaction if it gets kicked back.
Transaction fees just went nuts during the recent attack.

This is correct. Especially if they're trying to just play a market, which many will, and many will use CME for that, not blockchain.
But you don't get that kind of money by being an idiot. A lot of wealthy people are going to be ready to understand the merit and *real* value of BTC. This money will largely be a pump for BTC and I think we'll start seeing it come in 2018.
Just speculation.

It does seem weird that that graph would only use data from one node. Seems like you'd have multiple nodes reporting what they're seeing around the world and take an average, or even ignore the zeros since you know they can't be representative of the average node.

I don't know,,, fees may go down, but they're going to stay high until we get some scaling solution. They may come down from $10 range, but probably still at least $3-$6 for the foreseeable future.

Well, Coinbase *was* going to credit people 2X coins after the fork, that was pre-cancellation announcement, but I imagine they'd still make good on that promise, so you're probably ok.
If you want to guarantee it though, you need to get your coins out of the exchange and hold your private keys. But if the fork really happens and is worth anything I imagine Coinbase will make good on it and give you the coins or their value as of the fork. That's speculation though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:14:36

No, not all.
See [this email]( though, posted on the 30th of July. Is it real, was it really posted at that time, etc. you have to be skeptical but there's no question the writing is on the wall with that BCash pump and dump last weekend right after the 2X cancellation.

Yeah, but it's not free for Coinbase to take any action like that. In their fee structure, I doubt they wrote in "Oh, we need to charge high enough fees so that when a fork occurs and starts gaining ground we can send everybody their new forked coins".
They provide an exchange service and didn't promise a money management system. To expect them to provide that service immediately and just absorb all of the cost is unreasonable.

This could only be good for you, bad for someone else.
In step (2), you've acquired your .01 B2X from someone else, like Shapeshift, or some other exchange. Step 2 is you receiving B2X.
**If** that transaction is "replayable" on the BTC network, meaning the source address has BTC in it, the replay would be sending BTC *from* wherever it's coming from *to* C on the BTC network. And since I own the private keys for C, I'm the owner of the BTC. Yes, this sucks for whoever sent you the B2X coin, but you yourself are safe in this scenario.

This should be irrelevant though. A conversation about bitcoin should be about bitcoin, why it works, maybe a little about how it works, why people are valuing it, who is valuing it, etc.
I don't even have a problem if they include facts like this. But this is **THE** kick-off of the discussion is always about how it's for criminals. I'd expect this out of a government spokesperson who wants to demonize it, but journalists should not have this agenda. 
Especially from news organizations who pretend they're not supporting political ideology.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:28:18
By the way. Monero isn't just for criminals either. Just because you want a transaction to be between you and someone else to be private doesn't make you a criminal.
If you want to go overpay for Tamagotchi's, you should be free to do so without the bank putting a hold on your funds. Without your kid seeing your receipt and calling you out on being a loser. Privacy is liberating, it doesn't make you a criminal.
Any liberty can be abused. When you are not a slave, you are free to be lazy with your time. You're abusing your freedom, but you ought to be able to do that. Privacy &lt;&gt; criminality.

(1) 2X cronies got together and sold all their BTC at ~$7.5k earlier today when they decided they'd announce 2X's failure
(2) 2X cronies bought in big to alt coins and sold off all their 2X futures
(3) 2X cronies announce the 2X failure
(4) Wait for BTC holdings to flow to alts
(5) Convert lots of gains from alts to now discounted BTC
(6) I actually think they'll probably buy back in some 2X coins and still allow the network to go live and hope it ends up living and getting mined. Why not? They sold all their holdings over $1k earlier today, they can buy back in at ~$250 still with a massive profit and who knows maybe there's room for another alt in the crypto-verse for a while? They may even be able to fool some poor people into sending them BTC via replayed transactions.
(7) Make no mistake, there are many many victims but this is a big win for those 6.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:23:31
If it were me,
(1) Trade all of my alts for BTC
(2) After fork, sell off B2X for BTC
(3) If BTC price is stable / within ~5% of pre-fork prices, I'd re-diversify back into your alt positions if that's your game. BUT if BTC price has dropped more than 10% from pre-fork prices, I'd wait it out a little while to diversify, I'd buy in on some more BTC if at all possible and wait for a BTC rally after 2X is well defeated (which I believe will happen relatively quickly, pre-christmas for sure). 
My prediction is BTC hits $10k by Christmas. Once we've rallied back from the fork drop, I think BTC is still a better bet than any alt, but if you like to hold positions in alt go for it, but you'll get more alts for BTC by waiting until BTC recovers from the fork dip.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:27:23
Yeah, things are super technical, and that's a big barrier. Someday we'll have solutions that make it easier for people and by that time I think the market will have settled massively. But until then...
Aside from that, there is SO much going on. Everything your other commenters have said so far are factors. Take a look at [this]( post I made the other day, it's not ELI5, but it is a massive factor in what's going on right now.
Boiled down, I think the most important thing is that Bitcoin has name recognition, and since it's open source anyone can copy it and make a tweak that they think makes it a little bit better and then they claim to be Bitcoin and it upsets everyone who's using something else which they have invested money in and want to retain the name. There are hundreds of billions of dollars moving around the crypto-verse, so these things get extremely heated and complex, but I think that's the nuts and bolts of it.
You also have this extremely exciting market where miners are incentivized to "support" or put hashing power toward making cryptos work. The more valuable the coin, the more valuable it is to mine. So If a group of Koreans buy up a bunch of one coin and skyrocket the price, you have miners switch their support to that coin, slowing down the other coins they were supporting so it creates a goofy ecosystem that's unlike anything ever before.
tl;dr Cryptocurrencies are changing the world, no one knows for sure which crypto (if any) will have market dominance in 5 years, but every crypto wants that status and is willing to do whatever it takes to get there.

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:53:11
Yes, as others have noted:
(1) Identify all possible forks you have coins on.
* Bitcore (might be worth it if you have a few coins)
* BCash (definitely worth it at this point even for a partial coin)
* Bitcoin Gold (probably worth it for anything more than half a coin)
* there might be more! Do your homework
(2) Make sure you've moved those coins to a new address before trying to claim on another chain. A common attack is for someone to hijack a wallet and as soon as you put your private keys in, it sends the bad actors your private keys who go cash out your coins on all chains before you can.
(3) Once you have a wallet or appropriate key import process for your chain, send those coins to an exchange account and exchange for BTC.
(4) Be happy that you waited until today, these coins are more valuable than they were when I cashed them out!
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:07:13


The problem with transaction replay though, is that you can't reliably *only* do this on one side of the fork. I you try to, that transaction might be replayed and both your coins ended up at this new address and you're back where you started (where you didn't want to be).

I don't know now. As far as I know BCH forked for difficulty adjustment Yesterday. Interestingly this looks like it had zero impact on the market.
I think BTC is far more difficult, but far more lucrative. There are graphs floating around that show the difficulties and block values for each chain on the same graph and indicate the profitability difference. I don't know where off hand though.

Indubitably. But I think a single block being mined in conjunction with market value will be sufficient proof of concept that block 2 and so-forth are a shoe-in. Especially now that the futures market has picked up. Not only has the futures value increased, look at the trade volume, it is at least as high today as it was during the exodus yesterday. I think these are clear indicators this chain will be mined, at least until some other big news changes things.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:27:46
Yeah, technically you're right but I doubt policy allows them to do that at certain dollar points.
Imagine someone buys 200,000BTC "shares" from them. The buyer just gave them ~$1.2B right? So they have this cash on-hand, great. But now what if BTC jumps tomorrow to $25k. Unlikely, sure, but possible. Now if that person wants to sell off their BTC at that price, they're owed more like ~$5B. Yes, they have the cash on hand to cover it, but that is a lot of risk to assume.
Sure, when the buyer buys their $1.2B worth of BTC I'm not suggesting the company goes and literally buys $1.2B worth of BTC on the spot. But what I *am* saying is that they are buying **some**. 
They have fancy maths for determining how much of the commodity they're trading to reduce their risk as much as possible, but you can guarantee that they absolutely will have some non-zero stake in BTC.
I've used large numbers for drama, losing ~$4.8B it's easy to see would be unacceptable for any company, but the logic doesn't change for lower values, they will buy and sell BTC based on what their customers are doing and based on complex models looking at volatility, price, news, etc. Just like they do with Oil, Stocks, Arms, Gold, what-have-you.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:33:25
That is what's great about Bitcoin though, it has the capacity to evolve and mitigate risks and threats.
If you are afraid tx fees are out of hand, and you are satisfied with a long-term throughput of 8x current throughput you can convince people that's the way to go and create a new network that does just that. Same if you're afraid confirmation times are too long, etc, etc.
The cat's out of the bag. We'll deal with these issues as they manifest or begin to manifest. It will not be the Bitcoin we know and love that survives, but it'll be a Bitcoin that's evolved to be better than ever.
Transaction fees are getting high, and they will go much higher I think, so we evolve, we start using off-chain solutions like LN and that allows us to pay the very high fees of the bitcoin network by the millions of small off-chain fees we paid. It is a brilliant system and the decentralized nature is the key.
As much as I like Monero, I actually don't think it has the appeal of BTC and in large part solves a problem most people don't need solved, at least in the West. Europe and US are free *enough* that we don't typically need to be making our tx secret. My hope is that people start moving to more privacy and more freedom I think this is best for everyone.

I'm not too educated on mining and the D3 situation, but right, scamming isn't out of the question for these folks at all. 
And truly, if you were in their position and stood to make literally millions on this scam that carries very little risk on you to execute, I think you'd need to be put in the situation to know you wouldn't justify doing it too. You'd think along the lines of:

Nah, it's not bad. You'd be basically broke without your BTC too.
I'm in the same boat. I've put a "lot" (not to most people) into BTC in the past months, and it means I have to tighten my belt in other areas and forego some creature comforts like food and clothes.
But, the delayed gratification is going to be worth it. Already, easily the BTC I've put in has gained &gt; 50% valuation. That's massive, I mean, if my net worth were all in BTC, increasing your net worth by 50% in less than a year is better than a full belly.
So take heart my friend. Delay that gratification and in a year or two you'll be able to spend that bitcoin in a lot more places with negligible fees, and it'll be worth a lot more than it was when you put it in.
If not, damn, live and learn. You at least have a good story to tell someone else's kids. You probably won't have kids because you'll be too poor and skinny to find a mate. But you'll serve as a warning to those kids.

Yeah, who knows what will happen. I think most people will be ok and there will be some horror stories, but it's just the nature of the new technology and the necessity to get burned and learn. Like the $30k lost due to the lost password story that circulated earlier this week. It's a learning curve and society will adjust, it'll just take time and innovative tools. A few people will get burnt in the process and we should try to minimize it, but to a degree it's inevitable.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:58:58
I'm no expert, but block size increases without a doubt are not scalable.
However, it would be nice to get more tx through, cheaper for now. What if we did something crazy like a 4mb size increase which had a size reduction at block number X scheduled for a year out. That way we alleviate our throughput problems in the short term, but put it back next year when (hopefully) off-chain scaling solutions are ready to go.
We pay a price in some huge blocks for a short period, but it would alleviate some of the high tx fees and transaction throughput in the short term while we get a scalable solution fleshed out.
Then again, the fees aren't bothering me. We don't have enough vendors to make small transactions worth it anyway, so it doesn't make much of a difference to me. I'm ok to wait for the scalable solution.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:47:48
This is correct. They don't have to do any technical "splitting". They just mark it in a database and when you log in it says, "espennn has two BTC and two B2X".
As long as you leave it in your Coinbase account, it just sits like that. When you go to withdraw BTC, they make a transaction no the BTC chain that sends BTC to an address of your choice. Same thing when you withdraw B2X, the make a transaction on the B2X chain to an address of your choice.
Your misconception is in the thought that your 2BTC that coinbase holds for you has a specific associated pre-fork BTC address. It doesn't. Your 2BTC is just a database entry on Coinbase's servers.
Coinbase indeed holds BTC addresses with coins in them, and they indeed have to split / manage those addresses, but this is irrespective of individual hodlers account balances.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:25:15




That is funny to me, but I'll be serious for the rest of this comment.
First off, I'm really sorry, that is a disaster and losing that much money is tragic.
As for what happened, maybe some sort of MITM attack between you and blockchain.info (not sure how this would really happen though, in practice).


This confuses me a bit. I've never used blockchain.info for a wallet, but you say the "9 BTC left my account &amp; hit my new block chain wallet". Which account did it leave? It seems to me if you had a paper wallet, and entered the info on blockchain.info, wouldn't this just be "importing a private key"? I don't understand why this would result in a transaction or "leaving your account". Maybe this was an address "sweep", not just an import?
In any case, as you've suggested, if it actually DID go to your blockchain.info address, a "clipboard" hijack or anything like that doesn't make sense. Since your paper wallet / you don't even have the private keys for that initial blockchain.info receiving address. (I mean, you have them, probably, in blockchain.info, but certainly not in your clipboard).
I agree, it makes the most sense that Blockchain.info had an attacker waiting for coins to come in, and as soon as they hit a bot issued a transaction out of that address. Damn that is awful. Sorry again.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:49:34
Yes, but if you "held" your paper wallet during the fork, you were "holding" your coin during the fork. To be sure you understand, holding a paper wallet **is** holding your coin.

I don't believe there can or will ever be a universal crypto. I think it's short-sighted to want or hope for that either. I feel like that's analogous in the early internet days to suggesting there'd be a universal website. No, there are different websites for distinct purposes.
Crypto-"currencies" have too broad an application spectrum to want or hope for a universal one.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:14:04
Even if you take BTC out of the equation entirely, it does make sense. What if they sold at ~$7500, and then put all the money into alts before the announcement and 2X after the announcement after it tanked.
If it were Me, I'd personally have bought back into bitcoin after the dip to $7300 yesterday, and I'd be buying more today at $6800, but who knows what they would do. They may be out of bitcoin altogether, but either way bitcoin being at $6800 today has no impact on the plausibility of the scenario I've laid out at large.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:40:54
My advice is to buy 75% of what you can afford right now so you at least have a chance to cash out 2X coins if they're worth anything after the fork. Then, *if* there's a dip in BTC price right before or right after the fork, buy in with the rest of your 25% available to you. Then, hodl. $10k BTC valuation minimum, by Christmas.

Hey, thanks. It wasn't obvious, the trigger for me was when I was keeping an eye on the futures market and I saw it bottom out around $150 and then move upward. 
The 2X cancellation news was EVERYWHERE, and if you're in the market for 2X futures you can bet you're damn well paying attention to what's going on. I just followed the white rabbit from there.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:05
What you're saying actually illustrates well exactly WHY bitcoin *ought* to replace Gold here. Gold has been historically used as a value-store precisely because it was scarce and regarded valuable.
There are vaults that sit literally full of gold because someone wants to retain value. What if! now they can sell their gold to someone who wants to use it for electronics or jewelry and now store their value in a private key. They can even save on the cost of renting that vault.
This is a fantastic optimization.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:49:06
I don't think it was clueless. I think it was a coordinated attack. That "bug" was in there intentionally as a contingency so the fork (as written) could not go live. BCash was the game plan all along and everyone involved made a ton of money off the 2X futures crashing, and off the BCash pump and dump.
Make no mistake, appearing clueless is worth a hundred million dollars.

IMO if **you** can't explain why it's not a scam, you might not understand why it's not a scam.

There's a big difference between something being "a scam" and "being risky" and "being a gamble". Why do you believe bitcoin is not a scam, but qualifies for some more positive description?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:13:34


I agree with you here. The mad rush for it today made me wonder, but I think this is right. They had a chance already, nothing has substantially *changed* in BCH favor.


Yeah, I agree with this too, but then again even without the technical understanding, Bitcoin for better or worse has grown and not everyone can be technical. People have a lot of money wrapped up in it now (even if a lot didn't start with a substantial stake, they have it now).


I hadn't thought about this much, but where else would the power be? It's an open source project, so the people making the decisions are of course the contributors. It is a super interesting dynamic though that these contributors who do surely have a stake and a vested interest, do control the future of the chain(s).

Yes, fork.
TBH, we should be fighting for the Bitcoin name and maintaining decentralization under that name. But someone with enough power could commandeer it. BCash tried, and what if they had succeeded? Or if 2X succeeded.
Basically, what would happen in this scenario is "Bitcoin" would become what it becomes and would lose any and all of us who value its decentralization. Yes, we'd fork, or start over with something new, or move to Bitcoin Gold or somewhere else and continue work there. Wherever those of us who understand Bitcoin's *real* value moved to, it would be similar to what Facebook did to MySpace. Yes, MySpace was great until it sucked and there was a massively better alternative.
The key will be recognizing when this occurs (BCash) and abandoning it before it becomes completely valueless. Luckily, shapeshift and other exchanging services make this really easy, just shapeshift your "Bitcoin" to something stable and trustless (XMR?) while you seek out the replacement / continuation of real bitcoin. If it's centrally controlled like that and beholden to a central agenda, it won't be any different from some digicash, or Apple-Bucks, or anything else. When it's controlled in that way, they can turn it off. Most people in Bitcoin I think realize this is exactly what we don't want.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:43:51
Probably not. They're going to ask for the same verification I bet. I mean, there are exchanges that don't necessarily require the verification the problem is getting funding into them, you definitely aren't going to be able to put USD in there without giving them all your info.

The market first needs to determine a settling point, and that can't happen until applications and adoption settle. I expect massive gains in 2018, and probably into 2019 at least. By that time I think we'll have a better understanding of how and where BTC is used, and where and why other cryptos are used. We'll flesh out a lot of the winner and loser cryptos, which were ponzi's, etc.
My estimation is
in one year from now ~ 300% - 700% increase
in one year from then ~ 100% - 400% increase
Then we'll start settling into a modest deflationary gain, maybe %8 annually from there on out, of course with ups and downs along the way due to whatever news is occurring, forks, etc.
Based on these numbers I think BTC settles maybe around $125k when it starts settling in. Just an average girl's speculation though.

Yeah, you're right. I guess this probably won't happen. I guess the moral of the story is to dump the shitcoins for what they're worth at 2x launch. Agree?
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:36:55
Of course, they're going through with this fork no matter what, too many resources invested not to. Thankfully, B2X price is falling pretty fast. They'll be lucky if it's above $1k by launch, and after the sell-off who knows how low it'll go. Miners will abandon it pretty quickly as it becomes unprofitable to mine opposed to real Bitcoin.

Yes, absolutely Bitcoin hitting a million is within reason. Anyone who tells you differently would have told you Bitcoin at $10k was unrealistic a few years ago. These are the same people who say commercial space tourism, driverless cars, and robots teaching themselves to walk are "unrealistic".
No, Bitcoin as a global currency is not a precondition for this valuation. Only that Bitcoin has been adopted as a value-store is necessary for a million dollar valuation.
No, without scaling, Bitcoin cannot be a global currency like fiat. Cannot serve as a global payment system like Visa. No.
*But*, we will achieve good scaling solutions. And bitcoin will be a global payment system, and a value-store. Just because it "could" hit a million, and even though it is "realistic", doesn't mean it will actually happen. The evolution of the technology, its applications and sister-crypto currencies will all play a roll in determining whether this happens or not. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:41:22
I think it'll hit $10k minimum by Xmas, maybe $15k.

@_date: 2017-11-19 16:48:27


No, not strictly, what makes you think this?
I mean, it depends on how you want Bitcoin to be used. If indeed you want every transaction to be on the blockchain AND you want bitcoin to replace credit card transactions, then yes, the current block size needs to increase. But this would have consequences.
The size of a transaction for sending bitcoin from A -&gt; B is say 200 bytes (this is conservative)
Imagine even 1000 transactions per second, being captured and processed. And keep in mind this is still MASSIVELY deficient for something like replacing credit cards. We're looking at 200 bytes 1000 times per second = 200kb per second = 12MB per minute = 120MB per block at 10 minute block intervals (what bitcoin uses).
So we need to increase our block size from it's current 1MB size to 120MB, and where does that put us? SEVERELY deficient, in fact this probably isn't even 1% of the number of credit card transactions occurring per second.
And if this much data is being added to the blockchain, who is storing it? Not regular joes, only big corporations and nation states are going to have the storage to keep this thing around. That means centralization, and when few people have control, few people can shut it down. This is **exactly** opposite of what Bitcoin is founded on.


Yeah, this is perfectly possible. And actually pretty plausible. But it's not here yet, and for the reasons I've pointed out, moving from a 1mb block to an 8mb block (BCH) is not a solution at all.

My prediction is a slow(er) but steady increase to fork-date, we might hit $8k by fork just because more people want to jump in for free 2X coins prior to the fork.
Immediately after the fork, I think there'll be a sharp drop. You'll have 2X'ers making a concerted effort to reduce the value of BTC in favor of 2X, so there'll be some sell off there. Likewise with miners switching their attention to 2X we'll see a slowdown on the BTC chain and this will be reflected in price.
I think the price difference from 24hr before the fork to 24hr after the fork will be roughly -10% for BTC while B2X will start off valued at about 15% BTC value.
The 2-4 weeks I think will be relatively stable. A Lot of BTCers will be selling off their 2X and vice versa. Of course BTC selling at $7k buys a lot of B2X at $1k, I think we might see a pump of 2X for a couple weeks and mirrored by a drop or relative stability in BTC price. BTC price may dip below $7k, but my guess is it will NOT dip below $6k.
After a month, we'll see the market decide that BTC is the real winner. I think BTC will start rising again getting back to pre-fork prices by end of year. 2X might remain stable, but will likely devalue somewhat to between $400 and $800. 2X will live quite a while, just like BCH has stuck around and even gained some popularity lately. In the long run, I'm not sure there's room in the market for all three, maybe not even room for two variants of bitcoin.
BTC will maintain market cap leadership in the short term, and in the long run though. I think BCH has more longevity than 2X. There will be some powerful zealots that try to keep 2X alive as long as possible, but within 3 months or so, the main 2X actors will have cashed out their holdings (dumped). Even now they see the writing on the wall, it's a hopeful hostile takeover attempt with a pump-and-dump backup plan that might be realized sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:46:36
Assuming you have your private keys, and those addresses had coins at the time of the forks.
(1) Download a bitcoin cash wallet that will let you import your private keys. What wallet are your bitcoins in? You should be able to export your private key, or generate the backup phrase and use that.
(2) Import using your new wallet. There should be an "import" option or a "restore" option, and there you can enter your private key or your passphrase and it should sync and show you an equivalent BCH balance to what you had in BTC.
The exact same process will follow for BTG. However, BTG hasn't officially launched to the public yet so an option doesn't exist that I'm aware of. [This]( coinomi writeup looks like it gives you a walkthrough for getting your BTG. Good luck.
And you'll do the same process for 2X also in a couple weeks, hopefully those babies are worth as much as their futures currently by the time we can offload them!
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:26:36

I think those who were going to cash out, did. Wouldn't you have cashed out already if you were going to? If not, what are you waiting for? The rest of the people you're thinking are going to cash out so you get a lower price when you do? Probably not.
I think OP is right, we're in the dip now. Plus, there will be some free money. It only takes a single miner to mine that 2X chain despite it being "called off" the cat is out of the bag, just look at the futures market, it's not at $0. If one miner dedicates a small level of power to it, they can get 100% of the block rewards, even at a $200 valuation (it's over $300 right now) with no tx fees, that's ~$2500 per block mined, if you're not competing with anybody that's a quarter of a million dollars per day. Think about that.

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:21:43
Typically, if I have money to put toward BTC, I just buy all-in.
Over the last week, I had a buy-plan, it sat at $6.4k and I thought it might go lower so I bought half of what I was planning to to make sure I got in at at least $6.4 and was hoping for sub 6. Ended up going the rest the way in at $7.2k and I'm ok with that.
I think we're on the way up for the foreseeable future, so my money would be all-in from here on out. There'll be little dips here and there but barring any serious changes we'll probably see $8k by the end of this month and $10k by Christmas.
If CME really goes live in Dec, we might go well above $10k by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:31:29


It was and is, everyone has recognized the value pretty early though and you get the toxic ecosystem of forks and fighting and a few billionaires trying to cheat a lot of people, so it needs time to be sorted out. We'll get there though.
Screaming HODL is valid. Bitcoin is massively undervalued still. Lots of people who don't know they will want it, will want it. It's already valuable, but once we have good scaling solutions in place it'll start realizing its potential as a credit card replacement.
Greed is a factor, but believing the value will go up (at least among a lot of us) isn't just based on greed it's based on fundamentals of what makes Bitcoin.


You are, but with education you'll get to the point of realizing it really is the future, and there's real value in it.
When it's just your day-to-day currency and you're not concerned with what the conversion rate to fiat is, you'll realize it's not greed anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:18:30
This is very valid. I got in early and lost to MtGox which was very discouraging. Buying at $175 I wondered if it was the right move. Having gotten in at that price and sticking it out for some ups and downs made it easier to buy at $3k, and $5.5k, and $6.2k. I watched the dip below $6k and wished I had any money to buy in the dip. I don't care what the price is, I'll be buying again soon. In the future, when it dips to $20k I'll look back on today's buys the same way I look at the $3k buys today. Always a good move.
The tx fees don't bother me either. Once the attack is over, we'll be back to regular tx fees, and eventually we'll have some scaling solutions to help further. Until then, people are going to keep seeing BTC resilience, people are going to keep getting in, hodling, and price is going to continue to rise.
I just can't wait until day-to-day tx are more common.

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:05:22
Well, even 2 and $3 fees are high, it does make it unusable as a day-to-day currency. People aren't going to be willing to pay a $3 premium on their gas, groceries, and morning coffee. So that is a scaling problem. But we do agree the current issues are bch and bad actors' fault.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:40:39
Yep. Was hoping to see it get below 6k again but I didn't have confidence it did, so I bought some at 6.4k, and again this morning at 7.2k. Not looking back. USD price is becoming less and less relevant, and tx fees are worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:08:34
It is entirely possible that bitcoin will bust for any number of reasons.
Value of anything and everything varies. It will boom, it will bust, it will boom again and it will bust again. We've already seen busts a few times. We'll see it again, and again. But! Crypto is here to stay. Bitcoin indeed has first to market advantages and name recognition. Time will tell if that's enough to keep it at the front of the pack forever, or not.
Most people are realistic and recognize that the price will *fluctuate*. That being said, there are sound arguments for Bitcoin being severely undervalued today. That's why most people across the board are bullish. There is a MASSIVE market of people who do not have bitcoin now, and WILL want it in the future. Perhaps that's a speculative statement, and perhaps Bitcoin is the "MySpace" to another coin's "Facebook", but to most people who are participating in the market now, we know 20 people who are not participating who would benefit from participation. That is a good indicator that future valuation will increase, and that we are not actually in a bubble.
It is entirely reasonable that in 10 years bitcoin has a 10x market cap to what it has now. Maybe many booms and busts to get us there, but try making a case for a bitcoin market cap of .25 what it is today. Assume we're in a bubble, and that price drops to ~$2k and becomes about at least as stable as gold there. We were in a bubble and it burst to there. Try explaining why that scenario is any more reasonable than a 10x valuation, or 100x for that matter.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:30:34


This is so ridiculous. I hope it's a troll. Deflation can't even occur without a healthy economy.
Plus, imagine your illustration is true, and literally you could buy a motorcycle today, but in 2 weeks you could buy 2, and in 4 weeks you could by 4. 
Assuming this is the case, every two weeks your motorcycle purchasing power doubles. Waiting just 4 months total now you can buy 256 motorcycles. If you wanted to buy a motorcycle in the first place, you're now wealthy enough that the purchase of a single motorcycle is less than .5% of the money you were considering using to buy a motorcycle just 4 months ago. At some point, you're going to say, "you know what? I'm going to get the motorcycle." 
Or you're not, and you're going to be extremely wealthy, with no motorcycle.

Be careful getting advice online right now. The whole crypto-community is drenched in warfare and uncertainty. I don't know if you understand what's going on with 2X, BCH, BTC, right now, but "shitshow" is kind of an understatement. I made [this]( post the other day, take a read through it and some of the comments there. Things are really exciting and changing EVERY day right now.
You are going to run into a lot of agenda on this sub, and I think that's what you're hearing from people like dufff who answered on this post. I'm not suggesting you should take my advice either, just educate yourself and make your own decision.
To your question though, no, I don't think it's good to be buying small amounts like $5 at a time, especially with high transaction fees the way they are right now you're WAY better off saving on those transaction fees, saving up your $100 and buying that all at once.
Yeah, you do lose out on any gains in the mean time while you were saving, but on a $5 investment, those gains might not cover your transaction fees.
I admittedly have bias, but I think Bitcoin is going to end up winning this fight with 2X and BCH. Things will calm down in the community in coming months, and Bitcoin is going to continue to rise. Your best bet is to buy in as much as you can at a time (don't forget, there's substantial risk, don't invest what you need to live), keep buying in. People who say you're no longer early to the game are wrong. They don't get it, and they don't have data to back it up. They just look at the price graph and compare it to stocks and think it must be a bubble.
Bitcion isn't a stock. It's a new monetary system that is financially liberating. It's massively valuable, and VERY few people have it. In months and years to come VERY MANY people WILL want it. This is demand, and it's the reason Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow. Sure, another better coin may come along and replace bitcoin, but 2X and BCH are not it, they've already been rejected. If BCH had longevity and could take over, it would have been on that trajectory before this month with the 2X scare. 2X was rightfully canceled (although if you read my post I linked, that was just a very lucrative cash-in for those involved), but the only reason that cancellation and cash grab occurred is because those 6 (at least) realized that 2X was not going to replace the real Bitcoin.
So in the near term, AND the relatively long term Bitcoin is going to be king of cryptos. And with 2X and BCH failure to dethrone, it is going to take a wonderfully novel idea to do so.
Unfortunately, you will need to be a little savvy to benefit in these early days. You need to have some idea what a private key is, and whether you own it / hold it, where it is, how to recover it, etc. It is not easy yet (another indicator you're still an early adopter). Your best bet is a hardware wallet, like a trezor or ledger. You need to start learning, backup your recovery phrase, etc.
If you get into this market and don't know what you're doing, you very well may end up burned. See my [PSA]( where I detail some of the ways people were / are going to be short-changed by the 2X fork.
Someday this stuff will be easy and by that time the boom will be over and it'll just be the way things are, but we're not there yet. Feel free to ask me questions on here, I'm still a student, but I believe in the technology and I think it's best if we can onboard people safely so I'll try to help you if I can. Most importantly though, do your own research, ask for references when people tell you things (including anything I've said) and be careful it is still very risky.

Go to the CSE department of your school and just be bold and ask if one of your fellow students will sell you bitcoin. Tell them you'll pay them market+5% and you'll pay the transaction fee and I bet you'll find someone who will sell you as much as you want to buy.
Yeah, you're paying a premium, but it's worth it. Hell, ask if they'll sell it to you at market rate and you might find someone.

We do disagree here. So what's your prediction? 1 block? 0 blocks? 10-20? Where does this thing die altogether?

Ask the next 10 people you encounter whether it's too late.
When basically none of them are aware of bitcoin, that's your answer. Those 10 people aren't even aware of the market. That makes you an early adopter. Bitcoin is not ready for day-to-day transactions yet. When it is it will be massively valuable. It's not too late, not by a long shot.

Thanks for the bitfinex reference, that is really helpful for me to understand what's going on.
That wager is great. It definitely would've been good to put those coins in escrow at the time of the bet to guarantee the loser(s) pay. A good on-chain smart contract would've been ideal. And yeah, it's going to be a very expensive day for Roger Ver. 
After seeing the cancelation news, if I were one of the people on that wager, I myself would buy buying miner time to mine that 2X chain to 100 blocks. Guaranteed you could pay a miner directly for their mining time to mine a chain no one else is mining.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:47:42
Any number and any date is always speculation, of course.
No one could've (reliably) predicted 2X would be abandoned, no one at the beginning of this year could've predicted BTC boom to where it is today.
My $10k prediction is admittedly **complete** speculation, and I make no claim to any substantive or quantitative indicators.
That being said, I think weathering this 2X shitshow is a very positive indicator for network / currency / community longevity. $10k by Christmas isn't exponential growth it's conservative and linear given incoming interest and onboarding.
IMO we have a boom ahead of us. There is plenty of money not in the Bitcoin market yet and market acceptance is at its VERY beginning and early stages. As Bitcion's name and reputation continue to improve, we're going to see an explosion. Right now, I think it'll be slow and steady linear growth until we hit that boom. The linear growth I think will have a good factor, i.e. allowing us to hit the $10k mark by Christmas, but within the next year I think we'll see the boom.
Right now probably less than 0.5% of people (people in developed countries with mature economies that is) own bitcoin. I think within the next year, MANY of those people will *want* bitcoin. That's **demand** and when we hit get there, that will trigger the explosion. Until then. Good linear growth. The community of hodlers see BTC at $7k and know it's a low valuation. As people earn fiat, they're putting it in BTC and will continue to do so, that'll keep us on this good linear growth to $10k.
Just a simpleton's prediction though.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:10:29
I'm completely serious, **never**.
This isn't a one-time investment for me, it's not a get rich quick scheme it's a lifestyle choice to live with greater economic freedom.
I am all-in on bitcoin and other cryptos. It is the future, and I am slowly trying to move my life to crypto. Unfortunately I have to wait for the grocer and gas stations and utility companies to start accepting BTC (or another crypto) as payment, but I believe they'll get there. When that happens, it's not "selling" or "cashing out", but it is a currency that's deflating rather than inflating.
Until then, I try to at least settle personal debts and execute transactions using BTC to slowly but surely help people understand and adopt it so they can achieve the same freedom of controlling their own money.
I absolutely believe that every dollar I put in today will be worth substantially more by the time I'm ready to use it in a transaction, but that doesn't stop me from transacting with it today.
If I can buy something with BTC my goal is to convert enough fiat to BTC to cover the purchase (and then some) first, and then pay in BTC. That way I don't have the psychological pain of spending bitcoin as it's value is rapidly increasing. i.e. if I'm going to buy a $100 item with BTC, I'll go buy $110 worth of BTC first (net worth didn't change other than transaction fee and BTC purchase fee), and then buy what I was going to buy, but with BTC rather than fiat. Now my net worth has still only changed by the price of whatever I'm buying (and fees), but I figure in the long run I'll make up the fees and more with the $10 I put in on top of the purchase price.
Get it?
Yes, some people will get rich, many have, and many still will, off of BTC. Yes, you can ride the train and make money by being an early adopter, but that's a small piece of the value of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:22:47
Right. I don't even understand how the market exists at all. For instance on HitBTC, I tried to sell B2X that I didn't have and I got an "insufficient funds" error (despite having various other crypto-holdings including BTC which could have acted as a collateral of sorts).
So when they first launched their futures market, I'm not sure how it existed if no one was able to issue a Sell order... All I can figure is that the exchange(s) came up with a price, and gave everyone the option to buy. Those trying to sell were met with the same "insufficient funds" error I received, and those buying bought directly from the exchange. Now those who bought are free to sell the futures they own and you begin to arrive at a "real market" doing real price discovery.
Perhaps HitBTC started out ONLY allowing Limit orders for buyers, that way they just sit there as open orders at various prices for a day. THEN HitBTC starts "filling" those highest value buy orders while ignoring the sell orders, and after they've sold some collective percentage of their BTC holding (since they know they'll have this in 2X coin after the fork) then they stop selling and allow the natural market to take it from there and those who bought from the exchange can sell to others and you get a real market. I haven't found any docs on this but I presume it must be the only way it can function.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:49:58
Could be, but most people getting Bitcoin actually want bitcoin on its own merit. The demand is real irrespective of what happens here.

@_date: 2017-11-14 15:01:48
Looking at the block chain and movement of coin, if you see 10 different addresses consolidate to one in a short period, it's relatively easy to conclude that those belong to the same entity.
Then you take a look at where those 10 addresses got their money and if they spent any anywhere else, etc.
Not very good for privacy to do what you're suggesting. But really, but it's extremely difficult to maintain privacy anyway. If you're up to no good, don't expect not to be caught.
Privacy-wise, don't look at bitcoin as much more secure than your credit card.
If it were me, I'd send your coins in the 10 addresses to at least a few new ones on your trezor in random amounts and over the course of at least a few days. And send all the ones you're planning to sell to maybe 2 addresses, send the amounts you're planning on selling. That way you can empty those two addresses completely when it's time to sell but the other receiving addresses don't scream any association.
But truly, if someone's really looking into you, don't think you're private. If you need privacy move to XMR.

Where does this number come from? I'm not saying you're wrong, just wondering where you're getting that number.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:51:12
I hope you consider my honesty.
Transaction fee prices are indicative of the market **period**. 
If indeed these fees are due to any concerted attack, it means the attackers attribute MASSIVE value to these transactions and are willing to pay for the attack.
If indeed these fees have nothing to do with ANY attack, it means the users of bitcoin attribute MASSIVE value to these transactions and the bitcoin network / ecosystem, and are willing to pay for it.
In either case, this is just a marketplace. The wheels are turning and everyone agrees its in Bitcoin's best interest to bring these fees down so we can do more transactions less expensively, and we'll get there.
But, this is not good news for bch. The crooks and users of that network think it is, and they've convinced some people of that, but they're going to end up getting burned by the crooks (again). Just like they were with their 2X futures. I'm sorry to all those who fell for it.
If people wanted bch they would've adopted it in August. Instead, it's value steadily fell until they started pumping it as 2X slowly died.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:10:20
You won't find much argument from me here, I mainly agree with you. But, the reality is that Bitcoin fees and confirmation times today are prohibitive and a major obstacle to mainstream fiat replacement. There is still maturing to do.

Sure, but it's kind of a self-fulfilling cycle.
*With* significant mining support, the maturation time will be expedited and profitability increases.
It will be interesting to see what happens once its live. Will those who were 2Xers historically dump their BTC for 2X still? Will the BTCers dump their 2X straight away to cash out, or hold out and see what happens?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:54:39
Yeah, in a way. Unfortunate for anyone who had a stake in 2X at high prices. They lost out big, but for regular BTC folk, I think this is actually ok news. We get to buy more BTC today and we still get the airdrop that looks like it'll be worth something.

The transactions won't be invalid most of the time. That's the whole problem.
The low transaction fee way would probably work, but might not. There are better ways.

Wouldn't be the least surprised to see it hit $8k. I for one am planning on putting in a buy order pre-fork, and I'll buy regardless of price.
We will se a dip shortly after the fork, and I am hoping to buy the dip. A very short time after the fork and the 2X Dumpathon, BTC will be a clear winner and I expect a substantial rally to $10k and beyond.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:45:32
Transactions are a limited resource themselves. When you have something as valuable as bitcoin, and a limited resource (transactions) to move it around, that resource (transactions themselves) become valuable. They are expensive now because they are massively valuable.


We can't all just decide that transactions are cheaper. It's a market place and it acts like one. But what we CAN do is something like the following. (this is fantastically simplified)
We can introduce another network, and utilize it to make promises (transactions) to one another. That network buzzes around bundling up promises between people. Not the bitcoin network. Now a single BIG transaction on this other network that does all sorts of book-keeping can do a whole bunch of transactions, say millions, for a very small fee to you and me (to buy our coffee, or what have you), and it guarantees those transactions very quickly (lightning fast). Now, when the time comes, it ~commits~ those transaction by utilizing the bitcoin network. It DOES use a bitcoin transaction AND pays a (hefty) transaction fee to use that massively valuable Bitcoin network. But, that one-time massive fee is paid by all of those millions of transactions smaller fees that were bundled.
So yes, that hefty fee gets more expensive, but the fees you and I pay (for the use of that secondary helper network) are reduced.
This is a really exciting time in technology and a changing world. If you want to understand, great, a lot of us need to. But if you don't, don't worry about it. In any case, if you hodl your coins, they're going to be worth massively more as time goes on and the network increases in value.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:57:16
Ha, sorry I didn't realize you were OP of this post when you linked on my post.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:54:30
I think so.
I don't think it's appropriate to call it a "short" because that typically means you've sold something you don't own, AND are OBLIGATED to buy it back in the future. That's definitely different. I mean, imagine you truly shorted B2X, and you told and exchange 
"Yes, give me $300 today, at B2X market price, and at some point in the future I promise to buy it back from you."
Now if 10 minutes after your short, B2X skyrockets to $100,000, you're in deep shit because you eventually have to buy that coin back and if prices stay at that skyrocketted amount, you'll have to pay back $100,000 when you only got $300 for the "short".
The idea you're proposing wouldn't be like that. You'd be buying the BTC2X first (in the form of BTC pre-fork), and then selling what you do have, and hence, you have no obligation to buy it back at a different price.
But yes, from what I understand what you're suggesting should be allowed, and should work. Read their terms though, they take some digesting to know exactly what happens if the forks don't split, if BTC remains the dominant chain, if B2X becomes the dominant chain, by what date things occur, etc etc etc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:52:01

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:05:05
Block size increases aren't a solution. They're a band-aid just like segwit. BCH already lost its attempt at being a mainstream chain in August. That's why we're all willing to pay top dollar on transaction fees on the real Bitcoin chain, because it's worth it, it's the leader, and it has longevity. It is not realistic to buy coffee with Bitcoin today. That's ok. We're willing to wait for **good** scaling solutions, then we can buy our coffee with the real bitcoin that still has real value.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:06:38

Hold your BTC, cash out your 2X after the fork, if BTC is down, buy in more, wait for recovery and then buy back your alts when BTC is back up high.
Trying to cut your losses and get out of BTC right now is a bad idea. HODL at least until BTC is back to $8k it'll be there by December.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:04:12
If you had your coins at the time of the BCH fork (August 1, and you needed to have the private keys, were your coins on your ledger this whole time?), then you own BCH coins (and they've recently gone way up in value). Definitely look into cashing those out (or at least realizing you hold them) if you aren't aware of it already.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:10:07
I don't see it. I'll acknowledge that it is *possible*, but *possible* along the same lines as BTC hitting $100k this year. Just not going to happen.
Here's my rationale for thinking a crash like this is completely unrealistic.
(1) Bitcoin is not a traditional asset to Bitcoin users. Yes, there are investors, and newcomers who just want a piece of the pie and don't really understand it. But even having your own wallet and doing transactions, even if you don't understand it, hearing "borderless", "trustless", "permissionless", and the sentiments that go along with this is liberating. I think it's fair to say that most people in Bitcoin believe in its longevity irrespective of price. This fact will prevent the price from crashing too far, there are just too many people who genuinely believe the value is so much higher that if Bitcoin goes on sale we'll be buying it up and there will be buy-walls all the way down and we'll reach an equilibrium long before a 75% price reduction.
I personally can't afford to put more money in right now, especially when my day-to-day expenses still require fiat (sigh). But if we were back in the 3k range that just feels so cheap I'd want to get a third job specifically to put that money straight into bitcoin.
(2) The crypto-community largely understands Bitcoin's reserve-crypto status. A failure this big for bitcoin would spread across all cryptos. Bitcoin inarguably has the greatest market acceptance. While I cannot get my groceries with bitcoin, it's one of the few that I can get "some" things with. If we started seeing a sharp decline in Bitcoin we'd start seeing a sharp decline in other cryptos as well. As this started happening, with bitcoin as reserve-crypto I think people would start ditching any other crypto-holdings they have in favor of Bitcoin, in effect, propping bitcoin back up as well as the other cryptos.
(3) Perhaps most importantly, what possible catalyst is there for such a crash? I think the only possible reason is FUD, but FUD isn't going to cut it anymore there is too much education and buy-in at this point. I think we've already reached the tipping point or rounded the curve, people know the technology works and agree there's longevity. Another possibility in catalyzing such a down turn would be a USA ban (which USA citizens would not stand for. Taking people's bitcoin in USA I think would be as difficult as taking their 2nd amendment).
A lot of this "crash" talk I think is predicated on the notion that "Bitcoin is in a bubble". But I've not yet ever heard any justification for why it's a bubble. Common "explanations" are, "It's growing too fast". It is growing *fast* I'll give you that, but who decides what's "too fast". We have absolutely nothing to compare it to. What we **do** know is that Bitcoin liberates people and enables them to hold, keep, and transfer their money without fear of having it stolen or blockaded by someone else. That is tremendously valuable.

This is scary.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:37:02
This is actually pretty funny to me.
But no, I don't think there's anywhere you're going to be able to put cash / credit in and get coins out. Unfortunately you're going to have to buy coins locally or something.
If I were you I'd go to a local university and to a computer science lab or something and see if anyone would be willing to sell you coins there. You'll pay the tx fee to transfer them of course, but if I were in there I'd sell to you at a small markup.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:43:38

You are probably better off leaving your coins in Coinbase. Let them do the split for you. You can then exchange your 2X shitcoin for whatever they're worth (probably not much) in BTC and then you should be doing a withdrawal "send" of your bitcoin to your own wallet. Electrum is good. Or invest in a hardware wallet (probably the best option). But for the fork, you're probably ok leaving them in Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:46:51
Simple answer is "no".
Electrum is really good.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:03:06
Deflation isn't magic, deflation isn't an intrinsic property of a currency or a crypto-currency. Deflation is just a word in economics used to describe something that actually happens. I think you're looking at the whole concept backward, you're imagining this currency that somehow magically "deflates" and gets more and more "valuable". But this isn't how things work. Value, by definition, requires transacting.
For instance, you can't just create a new currency and say, "Hey, this currency is worth ten Trillion dollars per coin!" and it becomes true. The market decides the value. Once people actually start paying that valuation, that defines its worth. If you walked into a McDonalds and they had 6pc nuggets listed at $200, it doesn't make a 6pc nuggets worth $200.


This assumes no one needs or wants the motorcycle.
Let's just assume you're right. Let's assume that everyone holds BTC and it magically deflates, AND because of this deflation, no one buys anything. What happens in this scenario is that everyone dies because they aren't buying food, or gas for their car to get places. No one is going to work because they don't need to, they're already rich, plus, who would pay them. Their employers are all rich too, and if they paid them they're losing the future value of their magical deflating BTC. So no one is buying motorcycles because there's nowhere to be.
Do you see how stupid this is? It's complete fantasy, people don't actually act this way.
In reality, physiologically your body starts getting thirsty, and hungry, and unless there's something actually physically and or mentally wrong with you you seek that food and water, and you genuinely will reach a point that you **will** trade whatever you have for food and water. And since you can't eat or drink BTC you are going to be willing to trade it.
There **will** be someone in a similar situation who is also hungry and thirsty. And eventually you'll find a way to collude and you'll say, hey, how about you maximize your effort in collecting water, and I'll maximize my effort in collecting food and we'll exchange it! (In this scenario that illustrates reality, your BTC is actually worthless and is not deflationary anymore, get it?) And you'll find more and more people who are willing to maximize their effort to give you something in exchange for whatever you're maximizing your effort in producing.
However, some people will be maximizing their effort gathering milk, and some people will be lactose intolerant. The guy with water will recognize that there is value in milk, despite being lactose intolerant. This is where currency comes in handy. He can tell the guy with milk, "look, here's some water, but if you'll give me some of that limited resource BTC, then I can give that to Bill, Bill isn't lactose intolerant and he'll come "buy" some milk from you with the BTC I give him for doohickey's."
Now you have a functioning economy again. This is how things have to work it's the way the world turns. Notice, deflation hasn't occurred yet, and BTC isn't magically deflationary. This comes later and is a PRODUCT of a functioning economy and cannot exist outside of a functioning economy.


Your suggestion just isn't correct. It doesn't grind do a halt. Rather, when people stop buying things, the deflation slows and eventually goes to zero until people start buying things again.
Deflation isn't going to be on the order of doubling motorcycles. That kind of growth is something else. The increase in value of BTC relative to fiat and goods due to inflation will be FAR less drastic. The growth we've seen in BTC this year and in years past is not deflation. This is the market determining the true value of BTC which has nothing to do with deflation yet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:08:45
Another reason is chain-size.
Bitcoin works because the network is made up of nodes running consensus rules checking to make sure no one is cheating. To check those rules properly, you need the whole blockchain.
Keeping the block chain as small as possible is nice because it is still manageable for every-day people to run a full node doing verification (I do).
If you double the frequency of block generation, you're effectively doubling the blockchain growth rate too. [This graph]( would still be linear, but have a steeper slope.
Plus, you've effectively doubled transaction throughput. While this is nice, and alleviates the problem slightly it's not a "scaling solution", it's a very temporary and costly bandaid.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:39:05
I had a transaction sit a long time yesterday. You've got to bump up those fees, electrum will let you do it in the settings, probably in the same area where "dynamic" was set. I paid $6 and waited about 8 hours for my first confirmation. I think $10 would've been more appropriate. When Electrum determines an appropriate fee, all it can use is current / past transactions, so it can't predict the future, i.e. incoming transactions sent at the same time as yours already started raising the bar.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:52
I think you are misunderstanding something. But at root, you're right. Everyone in Bitcoin would like more transactions for cheaper. And we'll get there, but it'll take some time. In the mean time, buy up BTC at this discount because it won't be this low for long.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:40:07
I hear a lot of people are planning on selling pre-fork. This *could* be a good idea, but bitcoin is going to rally big after 2X dies. That may be a day, or two weeks after the fork. If you buy right now @ ~7k, assuming no profit from 2X coins, I think we rally to $8k by December and $10k minimum by Christmas. I'll be interested to see if you make 12-14% gains in your altcoins by Christmas.

From what I've seen, it's not really possible for anyone to "short" b2x tokens at all.
I can't even guarantee this, but from what I understand, on most exchanges you're free to **buy** 2X coins, or futures, or placeholders, CSTs, tokens, whatever you want to call them, but you can't sell them because you don't own them, and can't short them either.
If you indeed bought some, say at $200, and the futures market raised to $400, you could indeed sell those futures for $400 and make you're profit and you're good to go. But I don't think anyone allows you to short, at least I haven't come across an exchange or any documented reference of an exchange that will let you do so.
From what I understand, Bitfinex is about the same, but it does seem they'll let you use your existing BTC coins as collateral. Basically, if you own a BTC coin right now, then you can basically split it right now for a BTC1 coin and a BTC2X coin, but both of these are "future" coins, CST's (chain split tokens). Once you do this, I think you're free to sell your BTC2X coin today, so say you sell it at $300, today's price.
Then, when (if) the split happens, you've already sold your BTC2X coin and your BTC1 coin basically converts to a BTC.
If the split doesn't happen, and is put to rest, i.e. never giong to happen, I think Bitfinex would convert your BTC1 coin to BTC.
I'm not 100% sure on all this though I don't have an account with them and only perused their linked docs on the subject.
Unfortunately though, no, I don't think anyone was allowing you to short. I made a post asking if anyone had heard of an exchange allowing shorts, and no one provided me any reference to one.

I'm genuinely tempted to get into BCH for the pump and dump. $1000 looks like a support level for now. We already saw $2k+ and if they attack again we may see more of the same. 
Might be a really good time to join before the pump and be ready to dump. Last time BCH and BTC moved in exactly opposite directions. Right now BCH/BTC is roughly .20, with a pump to $2k, we could easily see .35.

The only thing 2X will solve is pesky decentralization. Maybe a solution will come along for inexpensive transactions on Bitcoin, and maybe it won't. For today, either suck it up and pay the fee, or use another coin or fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:12:18
Yeah, at this point I'm not surprised. Though, I don't think it has longevity. If the difficulty is left high, the coin doesn't have the value to be profitable to mine. If the difficulty is reduced, it's a testament to the coin's weakness.
With the cancellation news, followed by non-cancellation, and with the low developer buy-in to the product I have no confidence that regular people with any sense will have any faith in the coin long-term.
Like I said in the original post, this was probably the plan from the beginning, the 2Xers sold high, re-bought in low, and are probably going to sell high again before abandoning it for good. Those 6 made hundreds of millions off this deal, maybe billions. Definitely not good for the ecosystem as a whole, it puts a scar on the whole community.

I think you're ok. For now I don't think they'll chase off-exchange, at least if it's not high dollar amounts.
My guess is, they look at your buy price on Coinbase, and then the price when you withdrawal and they call that your net gain or net loss. That'll be your taxable amount.
For the time being I think if you get your funds off the exchange what you do with them afterward is too difficult for IRS to assume, so they won't. If it's high dollar, they might.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:31:34
The only way to do this is to buy directly from a party. Exchanges are always going to deposit to your exchange account first requiring a xfer out with an associated fee.
Going local is probably your best route, you can look on LocalBitcoins or CL and see if anyone is selling.
Electrum will let you generate a receiving address with a qr code that someone can just snap and send coins to. I'd recommend buying from someone in person so you can see their face. Maybe meet them at a coffee shop and have the caveat that they have to wait with you until you can see the transaction on your device and it has a confirmation.
You ARE going to have to pay them a premium on market price 3% is fantastic for low dollar amounts 5-8% is more reasonable. Plus you'll be paying the transaction fee, which, currently might be high especially if you want your transaction to get a confirmation within a reasonable amount of time, maybe $6 or so.
BUT it's worth the price. BTC is still on sale at $6.6k, you won't regret buying now and paying the tx fee and the markup.
Another option is to sell some stuff you don't need on CL or FB and sell it for VERY good prices if people are willing to pay in BTC. If you have something people want they might be willing to part with BTC to get it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:06:37
This, I absolutely agree with. I am stocking up BTC still. I was tempted to get some 2X futures when I saw it starting to move up, but since I don't believe in the coin I just saw it as too risky. Now I'm afraid the boat may have been missed.

No, when people leave their money with Coinbase, you agree to their rules, and their rules say they don't owe people jack shit. If people want their own money, they should control their own keys. It's the whole reason we have Bitcoin, so you're not trusting companies to "do the right thing".

Ideological value and utility value can really be separated though.
The 2X failure was largely a rejection of ideology, and that ideological rejection explicitly impacted its utility. The community at large sees the ideological value in decentralization and many saw or were convinced that 2X (correctly or not) was a shift away from that ideology. The decentralized ideology is precisely what many, myself included, think gives Bitcoin its value. Probably **the** primary factor.
Monero specializes in privacy, it's an ideology, but that ideology informs utility and from that utility Monero derives its value. I think Monero is going to be a big winner by the way, in the crypto-space. I think it's massively undervalued in its own right.
Etc etc, I don't think the ideological value is distorting the market I think it's informing it. Bitcoin Gold aims to expand on Bitcoin's decentralization. Ideologically, I think this is very important, but Bitcoin as it is today *might* be decentralized enough that people aren't really worried enough to sign on to Bitcoin Gold, at least that's my opinion. If 2X really did take over as a the primary bitcoin chain, I personally would consider being more invested in Bitcoin Gold. Unfortunately I think the Bitcoin Gold team put a lot of horses before the cart and it has put a big dent in confidence in their coin / ideology.

I know people like this. My father would be... not the same, but... you have to know your audience with some people. It's kind of like getting an 80 year old to use a smartphone. Their lifestyle simply doesn't necessitate it so it might not be worth trying to teach them.
Fiat will probably still be around for a while and people will manage to get by with it. Some people still write checks for their groceries and balance their checkbook with a pen at the end of the month. There's just a cost-benefit analysis they've done in the back of their mind that says it's easier to just get along doing things the way I always have than learning something new.
Actually, think about typing on a computer keyboard, that's a *perfect* illustration. There are probably letters you strike with the wrong finger, there are probably keys you still have to look at the keyboard to hit reliably, you likely mostly use one "shift" key much more than the other even when it's less efficient. We've all simply resigned ourselves to these inefficiencies because we're used to them even though over the course of our lives typing properly would probably be worth the investment it cost to re-train your brain and muscle memory to do the right thing.

This isn't a dumb question. Basically, using bitcoin when you can supports the technology / network. You're paying transaction fees to execute the transaction, this registers in metadata that the world is looking at to show "hey, bitcoin is being used", etc, driving interest in the technology and the end goal is more wide-spread use and acceptance.  
  
  
Personally, I try to find ways to make purchases using bitcoin, and say I spend $100 worth of bitcoin, I commit to buying $105 more. That way my net bitcoin holdings is always rising, and I'm encouraging its use in the day-to-day. Honestly, this is expensive. You pay the premium for the tx fees and on top of that you have to find vendors accepting bitcoin. The upside is that as bitcoin grows in acceptance, it's value has also been growing.  
  
  
  
That extra $5 (hopefully) over time will have a ROI which compensates for the premium I paid on the original transaction I made.  
  
  
Basically, I believe in the technology and I do believe that ANY hodlers will end up in the positive in years to come, but the more people ONLY hodling will slow widespread acceptance and use of the network. The more we use it, the faster we get buy-in from the uninitiated the faster it becomes mainstream and we start seeing society-wide and world-wide benefits of the trustless system.  
  
  
Hodl if you want to, but I encourage you to use it when you can. At any given moment, N BTC equals M USD. So assuming you can buy BTC for USD and use BTC to make your purchase, you didn't lose out on anything. You only lose out when you don't replenish your BTC holdings fast enough. Therefore, when you're about to make a purchase that is plausible with BTC, go buy the BTC first (plus a fraction extra) then make the payment in BTC right away and you should be satisfied that all you've lost is the transaction fees and the extra time it took.  
  
  
Eventually with widespread acceptance we'll have some really nice easy ways to do it and solutions which lower tx fees, we're not quite there yet but the more we use the technology the faster we get there. Sorry for the book, but your question is genuine and deserves a full answer.

Hindsight is 20/20. The reality is, 99% of people who bought at $0.06 would sell with glee at $1.00. I bought relatively early around $10 and was ecstatic to sell at $50. I lost coins to MtGox and while I'd like to say "I lost $xxx,xxx", the reality is that I probably would've cashed out to the tune of ~$3k at an absolut max. Only now that we've seen BTC gain popularity and it has real name-recognition does anyone have "to the moon" hopes.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:01:13
"transaction fees" on the actual bitcoin network are integral to its operation. The amount isn't mandated by anyone. If your wallet software allows it, you can set the fees you're willing to pay to zero (I did this a few weeks back on a transaction, and it took a couple weeks before that transaction occurred, it was either zero, or very near zero).
A lot of wallet software looks at the recent transaction and basically suggests to you that you pay just below the average so that your transaction gets confirmed relatively quickly. Many softwares have a slider between "faster" and "cheaper".
Yes, exchanges are almost always going to charge you a fee on top of this. What I've been referring to gets paid directly to miners for including your transaction in the block they're mining. That's why a higher fee motivates them to include your transaction instead of someone elses (with a lower fee), but if there's enough space, they'll fill it up with low-fee transactions, so eventually your low-fee transaction will go through.
Exchanges (like Coinbase, Kraken) add their own exorbitant fees so that they make a killing by converting fiat to crypto or vice versa, and some charge you explicitly also when you send your coins to your own wallet instead of leaving it in your exchange account.
When transferring utilizing an exchange, you're kind of at their mercy. They have the fees you have to pay them, PLUS you also have to pay the Bitcoin transaction fees on top of that, and they don't give you a slider for "cheaper" transfer options. They have strong motivation to get your funds to you quickly so they'll (you'll) pay higher bitcoin transaction fees to ensure a timely transfer. They don't want you to lower the fees and have it take forever and then you post on reddit, "Kraken sucks, it took 2 weeks for me to get my coins", they'd rather just have you pay higher transaction fees.
Finally, Bitcoin is gaining popularity rapidly, and its recent boom has helped bring transaction fees up, so they're high right now.

The other comments are already correct, but I just want to give you another data point. You're probably better off with keeping BTC rather than B2X coins. If you trade your BTC to B2X coins, yes, there's a chance that B2X coins will increase in value and you will turn a profit, but conventional wisdom says BTC is the winner here and B2X coins are going to be worth less in the near future than they are worth at launch.

My prediction is that current projections are correct, ~15% open. Maybe a pump (probably not), followed by a pretty quick realization that it's lost this game and a dwindle to roughly a BCC valuation, maybe 5%-10%. It'll live on for a while at that price. Once there's replay protection on BTC-side, valuation will probably dip further. I'm not sure the coin can live at all after replay protection. Miners will switch back to mining the valuable chain.
BCC has distinct differences / arguable advantages, and still I think quite a bit of community support. I don't think 2X has these things. It's pretty widely viewed as a hostile takeover attempt, and once that fails it won't have enough to offer to maintain viability as an alt. Especially as BTC continues figuring out ways to speed up transactions and reduce tx fees, 2X will lose all appeal. Finally, without anyone developing 2X code, it's always going to be left a step (or 100) behind.

Keep Googling and reading. Unfortunately, to really understand the fork, what it is, and why you get coins and what replay protection is, you really do need to understand how bitcoin works at the technical level. Holding your private keys is the most important thing, and as long as you are able to avoid doing transactions soon after forks, you will probably see this sub and various other places come up with "getting your 2x coins" type walkthroughs.  
  
I don't have any favorite links to share with you, I'd say start at the sub wiki and keep your eye on the sub, maybe read some of the 2X pro and con posts. You won't find much pro in this sub, but you will get an idea of what replay protection is.

Yeah, this has changed though. For as long as we see good growth we'll see people hodl longer and longer. At some point it'll even out though and the growth won't be so ridiculous. Thankfully I think it'll even out in the long run, rather than tank or pop. Growth will simply slow down to the sum of the deflation of bitcoin plus the inflation of whatever currency you're comparing it with.  
  
  
Once the craze is over and we've learned bitcoin's place in the markets it'll have a slow steady growth of somewhere in the range of 5% annually, maybe a little more, but it'll be pretty predictable and act as a savings account always should have. You're not getting mad gains anymore, and you could probably have more lucrative investments elsewhere, but at least your money is safe. But my main point is we may reach that normalizing effect at $10k, at $20k, at $200k, or the current craze may be too high and we'll back off to $2k or $3k and it'll stabilize there before volatility slows. Nobody knows.

No, there's no hardware or any other explicit obstacle like that. Literally, you could download the bitcion source code, make modifications to it, and run it on the same network as BTC and 2X. The rules the bitcion software follows currently are specific enough that your one node with modifications aren't going to bother the other nodes with "consensus" about how things are supposed to go.
The thing is, that you will never have enough power on your own to generate a block. Even if you did generate a block that was valid for the chain but included some nonsense, eventually, within another block someone else on the network would have two blocks (longer chain) and all of their software would respect that longer chain and trash your single-block chain as "too short" / invalid. So you can't really disrupt things unless you have more computing power to out-pace the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:28:18

I'm slightly confused by your math. 1/30th for 30 days is only 1btc, but your alternative is 2btc today. Should it be 1/15th btc every day for 30 days?
In any case, 2X is a big unknown in the &lt; 30 day timeframe. If I were you, I'd do some research on the fork and what it means for bitcoin. Once you have some understanding of the fork and how you believe it will impact the bitcoin market, your decision can be made easier.
My opinion, **if** you believe 2X will be successful, buy all you can afford right now, definitely. Then you will own 2X after the fork to hodl, plus you'll have the same amount of btc to dump for 2X.
**If** you believe 2X will FAIL, then you have more questions. Do you buy now, pre-fork so that you can dump 2X coins after the fork to buy more btc? (this is what I would do).
In my opinion, since there's no replay protection, once 2X activates, the market is going to slow, A LOT, we'll have fewer transactions and uncertainty to deal with until the forks have clearly diverged and a winner is declared. Part of this, I think will be a significant price drop for bitcoin (My prediction is bitcion price between $4500 and $5300). **If** you think this is going to happen, it might be worth waiting for this to buy bitcoin because you'll be getting it at a discount and acquire much better gains when the market recovers than you'd get if you buy today. This is way more speculative though.
  
Plus, if you wait for this divergence to buy, then you only get the coin you buy and you don't get the benefit of the forked coins. That's why I'd buy now, despite my predicted bitcoin price drop soon after the fork, I think owning and being able to dump the 2X coins will prove profitable, and less risky in the case that bitcoin doesn't discount so far.
It's all speculation, but this is my opinion. Happy gambling.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:45:41
I probably would have, but imagine owning 1,700 like the tweet reads, at .06. At maybe $1.00 you'd want to take gains and there's always the fear of it going down, so say you cash out only 75% to let the rest ride. A bit later you're faced with the same decision, you're down to 425 coins, but they're worth $10.00 now. You wish they'd increase in value, but is this a bubble? Let's get while the gettin's good and cash out, but let's keep 10% just in case. With 42.5 coins maybe the value sits at $100 per coin. So on and so forth.  
  
  
My point is, the concept of hodl hasn't really been around that long. Bitcoin was more of a novelty. Sure, a lot of people believe in it, but NO ONE expected it to hit $6k this fast. What actually worries me now is that the majority DO expect it to hit $100k within the next 10yr and people are "investing" (read "gambling") that this will happen. This is really dangerous.  
  
  
Hodlers, especially bandwagon hodlers, seem to get caught up in the hype and forget that this is completely uncharted territory. Nobody knows what's going to happen. "This is a bubble", "This is only the beginning", "A replacement crypto-currency will overtake bitcoin", are very real risks. This sub and a lot of the community bash FUD, but FUD are there for a reason.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:20:17
Yes, you're on the right track.
Basically, when you send coins, your wallet is generating a transaction saying send N coins from address X to address Y. This transaction is a bit of formatted data that has specific requirements. 
You can't attach a .png in the middle of it for instance, nodes would look at it and say it's nonsense and your transaction would never get included in a block, or in the blockchain.
The bitcoin software is open source. You can go download it on your computer if you want and make your own changes to your code. You can even add support for .png attachments in the middle of a transaction. The problem with this is that now while the networking with other nodes is still in tact, and assuming you still support non .png transactions you can validate other nodes blocks, as soon as your software sends a transaction with a .png in it, the rest of the network ignores your transaction and it will never be confirmed or accepted on the bitcoin network, nor will it ever make it into a (the real) blockchain.
The lack of replay protection means that no such protection is in place. So when you send your transaction after the fork, there are two chains incorporating the identical transactions. Since your address X had coins pre-fork, your address X has coins post-fork on both chains. If you send N coins from X to Y intending it for Bitcoin chain, it will occur on Bitcoin chain, but a 2X node will see your transaction and also include it in 2X chain. If you didn't intend to send 2X coins, oh well, and if you don't own the keys to address Y, whoever does now owns your 2X coins in addition to the Bitcoin coins you intended to send.
Ideally, (like Bitcoin Cash), your new nodes would not respect any transaction which belonged to the original chain / nodes AND any transaction your new nodes generate should be generated in a way such that they're invalid on the original chain. This is replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:31:41
Yes. Bitcoin is based on a long chain of blocks of transactions. Each block is dependent on the previous. So when the fork happens, it's exactly like a fork in a road. One fork might maintain the name of the street prior to the fork "btc ave", and after the fork, the new street forking takes a new name "2x ave".
Yes the fork creates two coins. Since your account balance existed prior to the fork, you have one "btc ave" coin, and one "2x ave" coin. Keep in mind, you didn't double your money, you maintained your one "btc ave" coin, while gaining in addition a "2x ave" coin. Where either or both of the coins could increase / decrease in value. While it's accurate to say you "doubled your coins", it's important to know that you almost certainly did NOT double your net worth.
Your next question is super important. I think it WILL be pretty common for the exchanges to give you your "2x ave" coins, they'll deposit them to your account somehow, but this ISN'T guaranteed by any means, and is NOT required by law or anything.
It's ALWAYS recommended that you keep your coins in your own wallet and out of exchange's hands unless you're actively utilizing the exchange with those coins. After the split, be careful and don't do transfers of your coin anywhere right away. There is a learning curve and you need to know what you're doing before you try to do it. It is a new technology and it is a risky environment. Just be careful. Writing this response led me to write [this post]( too, it's worth a read for you probably.

A lot of people not yet in the crypto-space don't understand that bitcoin is divisible at all. This is painfully obvious to anyone who's had any introduction but for people who have only heard "Bitcion @ $x,xxx" headlines and news stories think of it as a stock alternative and it does seem expensive when in the back of your head you're thinking it's indivisible. Make sure you mention divisibility to people who haven't been taught yet.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:44:22
I have another top-level point in addition to my reply to you (OP) in the other comment thread. This is a different economic concept from what I mentioned there.  
  
  
This is a situation of "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush". If you're not familiar with the saying, basically the translation is that when you own bitcoin, you have that bitcoin value right now, you believe that bitcoin value will increase, but as much as it may appear so this isn't guaranteed. It's "in the bush", you don't have it yet.  
  
  
  
This is important because your net value today, without looking at the exchange rate is X, we'll say you have $1000 worth of bitcoin and that's your entire net worth = .15btc (I'll use that number for simplicity, it may not reflect the exchange rate).  
  
  
Now, your net worth is .15btc = $1000USD. Today, if you decide to buy a pizza, if you pay cash for a $10 pizza, your net worth assuming you can't re-sell the pizza is $990. If you bought the pizza with btc and spent .015btc on it instead, your net value is .1485btc = $990. Setting aside transaction fees on the network, etc. your net worth was impacted in EXACTLY the same way. This is counterintuitive because it "feels" like BTC is worth more than USD, but it only feels that way because you're looking at the bush, you're expecting the value of BTC to continue rising.  
  
A lot of us feel the same way, and that's why we continually convert USD to BTC because we do believe that as time goes on the exchange rate will favor BTC but this is over time. In the day to day, (ideally) the BTC market isn't so volatile and your net worth isn't swinging wildly. It is right now because we as a society and as a user-base haven't really figured out what's going on and where the price should be. But this is precisely why you shouldn't be putting ALL of your USD in BTC. It's very volatile and as unpopular as it is to say, it is very risky. Anything can happen in the BTC market. Even though USD is centralized and federally controlled, it does have the backing of the largest economy and market cap of all currencies so its future, though inflationary, is MUCH more predictable and safe.

(1) Bitcoin is trustless. I can send money to X and I'm not trusting a bank to facilitate it. I can hold my money in my account / address, and a government cannot seize it (electronically and easily at least).  
  
(2) Disadvantage is relative. Disadvantage in terms of what? One disadvantage might be that it takes time to confirm a transaction. When you receive money via bitcoin transaction, it is not instantaneous. Another disadvantage, at least today is relatively high transaction fees making the currency somewhat impractical for small transactions.  
  
  
(3) Kind of. My prediction is that bitcoin will be used largely as a money storage mechanism, it'll kind of replace a savings account. You'll transfer money out when you need to fund another account or make a big purchase. This will be less of an "investment" and more of just "where you put your money". You won't be afraid to spend it like hodlers are today. It will steadily and predictably appreciate, but it won't be booms like it is today. Once use is more widespread it will settle down to a steady deflation (slow but steady rise in value when compared with other goods and currencies).
  
  
(4) IMO, Bitcoin itself probably won't. Unless there are major changes to the protocol / rules. But I think generally the changes to the bitcoin code-base will settle and be primarily maintenance changes so that it CAN stabilize and people can trust that no crazy changes are going to be applied. I think we will have some altcoin derivatives which ARE successful. Maybe it's bitcoin cash, maybe it's bitcoin gold or S2X, only time will tell but I think fiat for day-to-day transactions will be replaced with some crypto-currency which is specifically for those types of purchases. Still crypto, still decentralized, probably a bitcoin derivative, but IMO not bitcoin itself.  
  
  
  
(5) This is kind of answered in (4), I don't think it should or will be improved for that.  
  
  
  
(6) "blockchain technology" is a buzzword that is not really properly defined. But yes, the idea of a distributed chain of events that have hashed proof that nothing has been changed and everyone's copy of the chain matches so we can trust it. Yes, that is huge and will be a cornerstone in a lot of upcoming applications.  
  
  
(7) Thankfully nation-state inefficiency has afforded this technology space to grow unrestricted. This means some people were smart and made a killing. Some people were stupid and made a killing. Others were smart and made mistakes losing money and others were stupid and lost money. By this process everyone learns. I was a pretty early adopter of bitcoin and lost some coins to MtGox, it's a painful mistake, but now we know better. Nation-states will try to regulate, some might be successful, but would only introduce inefficiencies to the process.  
  
  
There are a million ICO's occurring and you do have a lot of buy-in to garbage cryptos that people do not understand. This is a greedy cash grab, an attempt to get in on the craze, and it is most efficient for these folks to lose their money and serve as a warning to others. It's painful but necessary.  
  
  
Unfortunately we see the same greed in the btc community. We have a bunch of hodlers buying in right now with this belief that the it's going to continue to skyrocket. $10k, $100k, no one knows the limit. That means the limit might be ~$1000 and we're going to face a major correction. This would hurt a lot of people badly, but it'd be an important lesson. The world doesn't need nation-states protecting them from their own bad decisions. They need to make bad decisions so they don't do it in the future. That's what's best for everyone.

I completely agree, and thought about posting something similar. The way people talk on this sub gives me anxiety. I'm "invested", but when I talk to non-crypto people I don't dare call it investing, I do call it "gambling".  
  
  
I agree that we can point to indicators and the technology is inarguably going to change the world. My belief is that Bitcoin will survive, but I am completely willing to acknowledge that it very well may fail in the long run.  
  
  
What if 2X actually wins completely gains majority market share, and the communities worst fears are realized and a few exchanges and mining outfits change the protocol little by little, crony-capitalize, report to their hosting nations, partner with existing multi-national banks, and Bitcoin is commandeered. Value likely won't sit as high as it is when it's no longer decentralized or trustless.  
  
  
The other far more likely and perfectly plausible devaluation of bitcoin scenario I keep in mind. What if CoinElPerfecto is created. It has all of the benefits of Bitcoin, open source, decentralized, trustless, borderless, asic-proof, perhaps they've found a brilliant way to have variable block-sizes, instant payments, is truly private and anonymous, and a new blockchain implementation which reliably distributes it so that any given full node can maintain only a portion, i.e. a few hundred Mb or something so it's realistic to run a full node on your phone. AND the community does fantastic marketing, getting hundreds of millions of people up and running quickly. Now you have a real Bitcoin replacement such that Bitcoin is simply outdated, slow, etc. This very well may happen and bitcoin tanks.  
  
  
Let's just stay safe everyone. It's fine to "invest", but be smart about it. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. And understand that nothing is guaranteed.

The safest, easiest way is probably getting verified with a well-known exchange (like Coinbase), link a bank account, fund your exchange account with fiat, then place a "buy" order. It may take days for the bitcoin to appear in your account, but when it does you should have already downloaded a [wallet]( I like Electrum.
When the bitcoin is available in your exchange account, withdraw it to your wallet of choice by sending the bitcoin to a "receiving address".
Make sure you
(1) Password protect your wallet
  
(2) Backup your passphrase securely, write it down, memorize it, etc. (Don't email it plaintext to yourself or leave it in a plaintext text file on your desktop or anything silly like that)
You can pretty much leave it like that, don't leave the coin in an exchange, all it takes is a government or exchange motivation to lock your account indefinitely or go bankrupt and steal your coin.
After the 2X fork, you'll want to look into getting your 2X coins (if you get your bitcoin before the fork). This might not be super simple, but keep an eye on this sub and google and there'll probably be pretty good directions for doing so.

You're young, losing $300 isn't going to hurt you. Go for it. (If it will hurt you, don't)  
  
  
I honestly regard it as a gamble at this point. I strongly believe in the technology, project, and network, but no one can tell the future. I didn't see it coming when MtGox stole my coins. PS Don't leave your coins on an exchange, get them in a personal wallet, password protect it, write down your recovery phrase, know how to use it, etc. You don't need to end up a horror story where your hard drive crashes and you lose your money.

I had to give this a try to see what you were talking about.
(1) I Logged into my coinbase account  
(2) Selected "My Account" and "Send Bitcoin" and "To Email"  
  
(3) Entered my own email address (not associated with my coinbase account) and transferred a few mBTC  
  
(4) Checked the receiving email address, which had an email reflecting the amount and a "login to claim" button  
   
(5) After clicking the link they had me select a password and my location, and voila I have some mBTC in that *Coinbase* wallet.  
  
  
My question to OP is, did you send it to the same email you use for your coinbase account? If so, it may just come straight back to your coinbase account. I'm surprised they wouldn't alert you about that though.
  
  
If you used an email associated with a different account, you probably have to set up an account with that email in coinbase to retrieve it. When you want to get your coins, send them to an offline wallet rather than an email next time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:31:44
This is bad advice in more than one way.


No, you always want control of your private keys. If your coins are stored on Coinbase, they're Coinbase's coins. If they go bankrupt, your coins are gone and you won't get them back. You may ask, "Yeah, but when has something like this ever happened." Look it up.


I don't know why this comment was made. Anyone who's been around knows you should own your own private keys, even if you're not a bad actor / criminal.

@_date: 2017-10-24 19:29:20
I haven't done it, but from what I understand, if your current wallet has an option to generate a 12-word phrase, this is basically a recovery-phrase for your private key. So then you could open up a preferred wallet with a "restore from 12-word phrase" option and enter your 12-word phrase, it would generate your private key from that 12-word phrase and your coins would then be accessible from that wallet as well. So your coins didn't actually "move" anywhere in this scenario, there was no transaction issued on the blockchain, rather you've just imported your private key into another wallet.

This is completely true. And exactly my point. $1 was the moon, once it hit it, $10 is the moon, once it hits that, $100 is the moon. We're a very decimal society.
  
  
The thing that worries me is that people seem to think that since these little moons keep getting hit, they'll keep getting hit, i.e. $10k is obviously going to be hit in 2018, maybe even 2017 after we're clear of 2X. Then it's $100k next, right? Then $1M?
  
It all seems a bit silly to consider hodling out for $1M. I am a big believer in it, and I will still be converting USD to BTC, but I'm not gambling my life savings, I haven't stopped other pursuits and switched them over to BTC. I will continue putting money in AND I will continue cashing out and taking gains to pay for the things I need in the year-to-year. With $2 transaction fees I won't be buying coffee or anything like that, but I will be spending BTC, absolutely.

Something like this would be good exposure, but the market speaks for itself. People are curious and as long as we're educating people they'll make the transition on their own. Adoption will reach a tipping point and then we won't even need to educate people. It'll be defacto because it works.

I don't get it. When MtGox collapsed, that was a bad thing and we lost money. We did learn a tough lesson.  
  
  
When 2x collapses, for most of us (at least in this sub, and arguably in the community at large) it'll be just another day. No "lesson" about running full nodes learned. 2x is going to collapse whether we're running full nodes or not.  
  
  
I don't feel like going through his tweets to know, but maybe he's pro-2x, and is saying collapse is a bad thing and for those wanting 2x to succeed, they will learn the lesson that they should've been running full nodes. But even this is wrong. If everyone supporting 2x runs a full node, sure it'll help the 2x network for a bit but in the end real bitcoin is going to keep the market cap and 2x is going to continue to lose value until the miners and exchanges still signed onto 2x have to jump ship back to real bitcoin anyway. So again, the lesson about running full nodes is lost.  
  
  
TL;DR The real lesson learned when 2x collapses is:

They're "similar" mantras, but not the same.  
In the fiat 2008 situation, you have people who are worried about their financial situation, so they're saving, so the things they would've bought aren't being bought, so store owners aren't selling their product, so they're worried about their economic future, so they're saving and not buying things or materials to make more product, so the material makers aren't making as much money and are worried about their economic future so ... ... ... ... It's a self perpetuating cycle which indeed does slow the economy further.  
  
  
Bitcoin hodling and spedning is different. A lot of Bitcoin supporters like and myself subscribe to the idea that the Bitcoin community and market acceptance benefit from its use. If bitcoin is only used as a savings account, its value is in long term storage and only people with money to save will use it. That'll be its purpose and it won't be a day-to-day currency like regular fiat.  
  
  
A lot of us would love to see BTC replace fiat. The only way this is going to happen is if vendors are accepting it, and the only reason a vendor is going to accept it is if people are willing to spend it. That's where the "spend it" philosophy comes in. The more we spend, and the more the market sees us spend, the more adoption it will have.  
  
  
If BTC has value as a savings account AND double's as a currency, all the better and the value of the decentralized network and consensus rules increase. This is good for hodlers as well because the value of the currency is increasing. But if hodlers only hodl, we slow down that market acceptance of bitcoin as a currency. But we'll eventually get there (hopefully).  
  
  
  
There are distinct advantages for vendors. Think of the places that have minimum transaction amounts for using a credit card. They have this because VISA / processors are charging them fees to work on their network and use their infrastructure. What if they can avoid those fees? That's good for everyone. In the short term it's not good for Visa, but from an efficiency and optimization perspective in the long run it will end up good for them too. That's a different discussion though.  
  
  
And yes, I'm aware that there are transaction fees on the btc network, and yes they're high right now, but there are answers to these questions, they're absolutely solvable, the network / community / technology just needs to iron out the details. We'll get there. But we'll get there faster if we spedn as well as hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:10:08
This won't happen. 
**If** hypothetically it did, then the network would cease to function and BTC would be worth $0, or $trillions, it doens't matter, no one has their private keys, so no one could buy or sell it.
But, in reality it won't come to this. The community is ironing out the problems slowly but surely. We'll have some robust hardware wallets along with other reliable places to encrypt and store backup passphrases and these losses will be FAR less common. It's just so new that we're suffering the learning curve right now. A few more of these horror stories and people will start taking appropriate measures to secure their wallets, passwords, pass phrases sufficiently.

This should be a broader lifestyle choice, not just in reference to hodling.

It's disgusting, I'm just glad bitcoin and monero are here so I can put my money there and have less fear of the government dipping into my bank account to pay off my peer's loans.

Yeah, it "seems" moronic now because we're living in the moment. Assume with me for kicks that a new coin comes along that IS to Bitcoin what Facebook was to MySpace. Everyone ought to acknowledge that pre-facebook, MySpace was THE social media.  
  
  
If Bitcoin 2.0 comes along within the next year and Bitcoin as we know it goes the way of MySpace, you'll be eating your words. People 10 years form now would be reading these comments and saying, "How were people so foolish to think that Bitcoin would grow another 1000% after it already experienced such a ridiculous boom? I guess it was just greed and group think."  
  
  
Again, the only difference between us and them is hindsight. You may think it's moronic to sell now, but it is absolutely a real possibility that in 5 years the bitcoin you kept a comfortable % in is worth &lt; $10 total. The fact is, it's not moronic, nobody knows.

This is normal-case scenario, and in this case even SPV's won't be confused. If strong replay protection were part of 2x, we wouldn't be having this conversation, we're in agreement there I believe.
However, where I'm ignorant is the distinction you're making between SPV and full node. If an address A had 10 coins prior to the fork, and a 2X client sends A's 2X coins to B as part of a 2X transaction which gets included in a 2X chain, that transaction will make it to the Bitcoin network (i.e. replay) and occur on the Bitcoin network also, those coins previously belonging to A on the bitcoin chain now belong to B on the bitcoin chain. These aren't counterfeit, they're Bitcoin.
Let's assume C is my address, both on the Bitcoin chain today.
Maybe your suggestion is that A sends his 2X coins to C (transaction 1), and that transaction occurs ONLY on the 2X chain. Now C sends his coins to my address B. On 2X chain, this is valid and works. However, on Bitcoin chain, since transaction 1 isn't a part of the blockchain (maybe fees were 0). A full node recognizes that C doesn't exist and can't send B coins. Whereas a SPV doesn't check and just says, "Yep, C sent you some coins" and respects the transactions. Is this what you're getting at? If it is, it sounds like the SPV is actually a NPV (no payment verification).
Let me know if I've characterized your suggestion properly or not. In any case, I still think that for anyone who "receives counterfeit coins", their mistake wasn't in failing to run a full node, their mistake was in (1) receiving coins before the 2x fork is dead and gone or replay protected, and (2) not using payment verification that works.
Your original point:


Is just overkill, you can go to any blockchain explorer and verify your transaction there. You don't need to run your own node to verify, you just need actual verification not NPV. If everyone who wants to transact in bitcoin needs to run their own node, we're going to be screwed on widespread adoption for a VERY long time.
I just imagine going up to someone,
Me: Can I pay you in bitcoin?
Them: I've heard of it, sure, let me Google how to accept. Ahh, simple, best practices here say I can download a node here... Perfect, just wait 'till I sync this blockchain
Me: Great, I'm sure that hotdog still tastes good in 4 days
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:53:20
You should only lose fees in this situation. Since you own the keys to both addresses, you own the keys on both forks. So your coins belong to the receiver (you) on both forks.

With basically no wallets, I'm thinking BTG may not really happen. And by the time it does / by the time we have a way to get access to our BTG, the value will have tanked extremely low, i.e. in the tens of dollars. Yeah, maybe worth the time for a few dollars, but largely just a flop.

I don't think there's sufficient time. I don't know if there are any current proposals, but trying to roll out a change that fast and distribute it seems way too risky. I think it'd be better to work out a properly designed, peer reviewed, and tested solution however long it takes and then distribute it. Let the network slow and suffer in the meantime while the community waits for the fix, by that time 2x may be largely abandoned anyway but rolling out emergency changes is reckless.

@_date: 2017-10-19 19:44:06
Can you go into a little more depth?


Am I understanding you correctly that you're suggesting that if I am on the receiving end of a transaction post-fork, my wallet may reflect a balance which includes coins from transactions produced on the 2X chain which do not actually make it onto the Bitcoin chain?  
  
  
  
If this is the argument you're making, then it's not "run your own node" that I've learned, it's "Don't rely on unconfirmed transactions right after a fork when they could've come from a chain without replay protection". If I've misunderstood your argument for running a node, what did I miss?
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:16:03
The way I see it, we'll have a lot of successful crypto-currencies. This kind of "google" vs "aol" characterization misses the mark. There is a lot of garbage ICO and half-baked coins out there, but there are a lot of cool special purpose cryptos too. Just like the internet itself isn't just one "winner" website, it's a collection of effectively infinite websites with lots of major winners and lots of minor winners that cater to specific people. 
  
  
The bitcoin "scripting" language is pretty special purpose limiting the types of things that can be done on the network. Bitcoin has absorbed a lot of the learning curve of cryptos with stolen coins, accidentally burned coins, perhaps an inefficient chain, i.e. full size to run a node is pretty big and growing which makes it a little more daunting for an every-day user to participate in the decentralization. But, it does have name recognition it's the biggest and the "best" currently, most widely adopted, etc. My best guess is that bitcoin will live on and be the gold standard of the cryptos. It will function as a personal bank account and people will store their money there. It will (might) be used for big purchases, a stable money-store, but at least as it exists now including high transaction fees it seems like a massive waste to broadcast and store a transaction recording your morning coffee purchase worldwide. There are much more efficient answers for these types of transactions, at least in non-dictatorial countries. Maybe bitcoin can and will grow to accommodate them, but maybe it shouldn't when another crypto could be far more efficient and less secure for these less important less valuable transactions.  
  
  
I actually do expect Amazon, Google, Apple, maybe some other big internet companies to begin functioning as banks as banks themselves become less relevant for banking. Perhaps Amazon will have an account balance for you that technically isn't money, maybe they'll call it Amazon Credits or something and you can fund your Amazon Credits balance in any number of ways, turning on ads / watching promo videos, sharing links to social media, etc, returned items get credited here and you can even "fund" with cryptos. Then Amazon can settle with its vendors (via Ripple?) but your account balances for Amazon Credits, Google Bucks, and Apple Seeds are kept relatively low. Bitcoin (or maybe even a lower-level alt-coin) is used periodically to fund these accounts.

Your question isn't silly. There are a lot of people looking to get rich quick. They may, and they may not. That's a gamble, not an investment. The hype around bitcoin has created a positive feedback loop and for now you have people being introduced to the market on a steady basis who are buying and not selling. This increases price, making a nice graph, increasing its appeal to newcomers.
In typical markets, there would be some "real world" reference of value, profits, etc. This market is completely unique so it's unclear where supply and demand will equalize in the long term. It could be $2k and it could be $2M, the market has yet to settle and decide. Most of us here believe the settlement value will be FAR higher than it is today. We believe in that and are happy to buy what we can afford. However, the reasons for this belief are far and wide.  
  
Personally, the decentralized nature of the network, the fact that you can hold your own keys and the government can't decide to seize your bank account, criminals can't (as provably or easily) gain access if you're guarding your keys properly, and no one can stop you from transacting are some of the key reasons I think bitcoin has value, will retain value, and will increase in value.  
  
  
The WHOLE thing is speculative though. Despite what people here like to say, there is definite risk. My advice is to not put all your eggs in one basket. But personally, I'm putting most eggs I can afford to lose in the basket.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:09:56
IMO there are substantial risks for Bitcoin. It's current value absolutely reflects the hype. The open question is whether it will maintain its current price, increase, or decrease after the hype recedes.  
  
  
In the end I do believe Bitcoin will live on, have a purpose, and succeed. I don't think it's clear yet what that purpose is. Is it a savings account? (I think that'll be it primarily), is it a fiat replacement? etc. we won't know until the market settles, hype settles, and use-cases normalize and gain / lose acceptance.  
  
  
I think it is entirely possible that the settling point where btc price begins to lose volatility may be $1k, it's also perfectly possible it's $10k or $25k or any other number. But no one knows. We will however, get there eventually.  
  
  
The hype itself I don't think can hurt bitcoin itself. The hype is only good for bitcoin and its longterm longevity. I do worry about the people taking part in the hype though. What if the market realizes a btc price of $2500 and moves toward that price over the course of the next 2 years, and then btc stabilizes and the market solidifies its "purpose". Now we have a whole lot of unhappy hodlers, but that's not a reflection on bitcoin itself. Rather it's a reflection of people who were all too willing to buy into a hype and "to the moon" pyramid bubble.  
  
Putting money into bitcoin is a gamble. I am one of the people that thinks it is unlikely that the settlement price will be lower than the current price (today's price), so I think it's a good gamble, but there are so many unknowns that I think you're fooling yourself to think it's an investment mechanism.  
  
I think, hope rather, it's basically dead now but if 2X were executed better, we very well may have ended up with a 2X chain that people ended up using as bitcoin and eventually that bubble completely burst because exchangers / miners bent it to their will and turned it to garbage.  
  
I think we'll dodge the 2X bullet, but what if we don't dodge "3x"? Something unexpected could occur and wipe out hodler's stake in btc.
