For it to become a widespread currency, it has to STABILIZE relative to other currencies. Sure, inflation is a thing, but if it's value is constantly outperforming other currency's inflation...
Look at it this way: why would you ever invest in stocks/bonds/etc if just holding currency performed this well?

So it only requires skyrocketing deflation because there isn't enough?
That makes sense I guess.   Dooms it for widespread use, but makes sense.

not at all, for bitcoin.  a bit of a problem for those that insist it could/will replace cash.

You said their wouldn't be enough value in the system if they were worth less. Implying that bitcoin will only work if they have a crazy high value relative to the dollar.

Why does it need a high market cap?
Would it be unusable if the value was closer to 1 bitcoin = 1dollar?

Well, I meant just in terms of the price of goods....    if everything costs .0000784 bitcoin, it's like the reverse of a crappy South American currency that could use a decimal point adjustment.

This does not make it any closer to being a "currency". It reinforces the idea that bitcoin is just an investment vehicle.

Or it become the palm-pilot of digital currencies.

well that's the intent. that's not what's happening though, or people wouldn't be heralding the "all time high market cap", as if it makes it a better currency.
