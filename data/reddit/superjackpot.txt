Lemme get all this straight....
So this post was about Bitcoin. A digital form of money. Not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things.
Then you post a Breaking Bad clip and all of a sudden this Bitcoin discussion escalates into a pissing contest.....
This ronjohn guy, sorry I mean r0nj0hn guy, says he's got guns and blah blah if you try to kill his family (ignoring the Breaking Bad reference completely I guess). Which you misinterpret as him saying something ABOUT you.
Then you waste between 3 minutes and 4 hours of your life responding to his empty threat with the biggest summation of garbage I have ever read - you are top of your class Navy Seal, have 300 kills - supposedly - but feel the need to brag about it. You claim to have NSA-like access to r0nj0hns Internets. Even though you're allegedly a Navy Seal, you don't wish to threaten him with the Navy's arsenal, but rather the Marine Corps, an entirely different branch of the military. 
And finally you make a serious death threat to another Redditor.
That is NEVER, EVER acceptable bro. I don't care what kind of asshole this r0nj0hn guy is. Even though this is an anonymous Internet forum and you are full of shit, he could contact the FBI - and they'll be the ones coming to see YOU. 
You're the same guy going on in other posts about meditation and how you never get angry? Really? 
So is it PTSD or are you just completely delusional?

LMAO. Before I typed that - I said to myself "Should I Google this shit first to make sure he's not playing?" Which of course I didn't do. Serves me right.

"The greatest change is that anyone using a New York-sanctioned Bitcoin or cryptocurrency service will no longer be anonymous."
Looks like someone doesn't understand the point of Bitcoin.

It's one thing to treat the Bitcoin concept like a ruthless speculator (I bet you own a top hat and monocle too?), but to brag about it online is sad.
I'm sending you this because I feel bad for you. I would send BTC, but it seems like you already have it all...

I never understood how PayPal was ever able to accept Visa/MC. Their business model is essentially "Factoring" (i.e. accepting credit cards on behalf of someone else) and is prohibited under Visa/MC guidelines. A large part of the reason PayPal came to exist is because most everyone else thought factoring was prohibited.
PayPal is going to run into a brick wall as Bitcoin and other digital money solutions replace Visa/MC - and nobody wants to adopt Paypal's digital money solutions because of all the bad blood Paypal has helped stir up over the years. I strongly believe PayPal can only exist in businesses where they have a near monopoly position.

Why would ANYONE follow a random person with a one-word name that sounds like a Spanish explorer for alt-currency tips? Alt currency is new. He doesn't know any more than you do if you use common sense. And the guy isn't even playing with large numbers. For these gaff-ass altcoins like XPM or TRC, you don't need large numbers to manipulate the price.
TL;DR If you follow the words of Fontas, you're a giant Craftsman toolbox.

How do you get approved for instant buys? Do you have to provide all sorts of info?

I love LOVE that trollbox. Not because it provides informed advice...oh it certainly does not. In fact, it's called the TROLL BOX for a reason. But it's a great source of entertainment while you trade.

Hey just wanted to address some stuff I've seen in the comments, stuff from OP, etc.
- Chase is a notoriously scummy company. They're arrogant, predatorial, and anti-little guy. So having said that, VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS. Withdraw your money, move it somewhere else. To a credit union. To an online bank. Whatever. When you give them your money in the form of a deposit, interest, etc - you're essentially DONATING to them and saying I LIKE YOU, CHASE! Starve the beast.
- If this really happened as stated and you aren't leaving anything out, carpet bomb every agency and organization that will listen. Write to the CFPB. Write to your Congressman (bonus if that happens to be Liz Warren). Write to the FTC. Call your local media. Call the national media. Be the squeaky wheel. You would be QUITE surprised at the response you may get. Remember, the US Govt has not banned Bitcoin so don't assume they are on the bank's side.
- Post on social media. As many have said here, proof in the form of a copy of the letter is very powerful and then people won't assume you're just trying to drive the price of BTC down.
- When you post negative stories like this, try to give the reader (this Reddit audience, your followers, etc.) a call to action. Tell them what to do. Suggest an alternative (FYI, Payline Data is a payment processor I highly recommend). Provide the email/phone numbers of the govt agencies you called. Complaining is fine and all but if thats all it is, your story won't be very effective. People will read it, agree, and then move on.

Confirmed working. Just setup a monthly recurring and bought 9, it quoted me a specific dollar amount based on current price...said it processed today and I'd have the coins by Friday! No warnings or "sorry" messages. Geez, thats even quicker than normal.

100% of the people who call ALL altcoins a pump and dump or pyramid scheme are jealous/angry they didn't see an obvious investment opportunity. Hey, we can't all win the lottery in slow motion. :)

Have you bought from Coinbase before? Has it been 30 days since your account was opened? I'm a yes on both. You? I wonder if they are "hooking up" past buyers and shutting out newbies until Friday...
