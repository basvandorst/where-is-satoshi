Yes it is a tool of amazing power my question is what can someone do with that power .
What ideas/concepts are floating out there?
We seen the blockchain being used to decentralize cloud services with Storj
At the same end you have torrent sites wishing to use blockchain technology to distribute content both illegal and legal.

That is so awesome. Thanks for replying . I am glad to here that you will soon be putting everything 2008+ for sale in Bitcoin. I think that if more artist see how easy it is to transition in to Bitcoin and get paid and no longer deal with the current  bullshit paradigm financial system.
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:52:38
Hell Yeah! Heard you on Let's Talk Bitcoin Great Interview and I hope this type of Sale will light a fire under peoples asses about changing the music industry and how artist get paid.

would decreasing the volume for result in a solution in which for example every state or providence would have its own blockchain for elections? 
For address I would think or imagine you would go to a designated place like the voting office and register directly in the office to receive your individual address for each consider election slot. For example Local(Mayors,Dog Catcher), Statewide(County Commissioner[Not Gordan sigh], Cat Catcher), and then National Office(National Rep, Unicorn Whisper) to submit your vote from. I can see a multisig situation where a vote is cast and then verify/signed by a Voting Official. The last bit I do not know how that would play out without in the Secret Ballot aspect of voting.
Just thoughts.

How was the experience and  do you think next summer more festival whether they're music ones or not will use Bitcoin as a payment option.

Thanks. It is not for everyone.

A Thunderclap is a messaging services that uses peoples social media accounts to post a message at designate time and date through  social media account. For example Dogecoin Celebrate its One Year Anniversary using Thunderclap. I allow my twitter account  to be used by the Thunderclap to deliver the Dogecoin message.  
The reason people use this services is depending on who joins the message the potential reach for the Thunderclap message could be far and wide. I have only 300 followers and these followers all saw my Thunderclap for Dogecoin. Even if a small fraction of these followers re-tweeted the Dogecoin/Thunderclap message that message has already gone beyond the faithful to the uninitiated that could potential engage with message because so and so tweeted about it. It is essence just a social media tool.

This what I love about Bitcoin it has enable so many people to be able to take an ideal that May have been dreaming about for years an turn it into a reality . You went and tried to use traditional methods to start this business even if you had a great business model, space, material, a little of your own captital, and clients lined up no bank would give you a small business loan. But with Bitcoin you  were able to go direct to market and now you are off and running. Cheers! Toast to you and a successful venture!

The Constitution is not outdated it is an object a tool like any that can be used badly. It may not be the best tool or a prefect tool but it is a tool that works and majority of the time gets the job done.
Open Carry does not spread fear or uncertainty in a community when anyone could be carrying a weapon. Study after Study has shown that violent crime is lower in areas that have high gun ownership. The nature of non-violent crimes changes were criminals not wanting to be killed by a home owner with a gun conduit their crimes in the day time or when a home is unoccupied.  There  also is not an increase of gun violence but a decrease in gun violence when open carry laws are in enacted.  
It was not until the end of the 19th Century and the beginning of the 20th Century in this country that gun laws restricting citizens ability to carry, purchase, and store begun to be enacted.  Up to the enactment of these news that started out as state laws not federal laws Americans carry the arms openly. The reason these new laws were enacted was under the guise of "public safety", when in reality it was one segment "white people" removing the ability of another segment "black people" from having the ability to defend themselves. 
This later segment was terrorize, brutal murder almost at a will, and because of firearm restriction could not defend themselves when literally an armed mob with pitch forks outside their home was coming for them.  This segment could not turn to the authorities because the authorities were often in the crowd of the mob and due to Societal Norms (Racism) instead of abiding by the Constitutions the courts upheld these laws in the name of protecting society. 
When Majority of societal norms change mid-20th century, the civil rights acts pass, and the segment of society that had been oppress all those years began to exercise their Constitutional Rights freely without fear of oppression it still irk people. Many of these people still felt it was necessary to keep gun laws(a lot of other laws) in place but more importantly began to increase the enacting of these laws through many states and eventual making gun laws a Federal matter. 
In California the year that the gun restriction was put place the Black Panthers had famously march into the California Legislation building and protest their grievances in front of the Legislative body with shoot guns.  All which was perfectly legal to do at the time. When you look at the historical record at the time people supporting the law directly cite this incident as the reason for the law felt necessary that "these people" should not be able to do this again.  
I will not gone in how this Californian Law became the domino effect of legislation action were any object a person is carrying is considered a weapon, how only certain segments of people in our society have these weapons laws applied to them at statistical unexplainable higher rate then others, or how police expansion/militarization through out the country was possible because of these gun laws. 
People should be able to exercise their rights without fear from the government or restrictions by the government which saddles their rights with unnecessary burdens.

Is this the method that people are talking about when they disscuss the use of blockchain technology as means of holding politcal elections? If so, will any  blockchain technology be able to handle the volume votes like for example the size of the election that happen in India earlier this year? If not, can it be made to do so?

I have always Love Shooter Jennings and enjoy his talks about Bitcoin when ever he has had an opportunity to speak on the subject. It is great that he is offering this single up for sale in Bitcoin hopefully if their is enough show of support maybe his back catalog will be sold in Bitcoin as well.

Seems kind of redundant and unnecessary to bring value to a digital product.  
@_date: 2019-10-23 06:11:29
True. But these are points spoken often by people outside the community and I think it is important to have "the conversation"  to either push back on or take in consideration how Bitcoin is viewed by a lot of people.
