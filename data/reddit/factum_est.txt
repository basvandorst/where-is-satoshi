No. I used armory and it doesn't support that. Which is good and bad. The other problem is that I am more concerned about human error than getting robbed or than someone in our office obsconding with the money.

I agree. It was on my phone. I tried but it didn't work.

I have consider secret sharing but I am looking for a more robust and user-friendly way of doing this.
Some of my co-workers and I could probably figure it out but the people who need to have these accounts more than likely could not do that.
Anyways, this still puts all the trust in one person. The person who divies up the key for safe keeping. The whole point of multi-sig is its trustless feature.

It depends a lot on what we are getting and how valuable we think it is. We are start up so we have to be careful in what we spend money on.
Do you mind giving me a little more information to go off of? What topics you would be comfortbale writing about and what kind of expertise you have?
We do offer all of authors free 1 year memberships that can be renewed based on the work they are doing for us. We are also offering a platform and way to get published that looks very professional: professional editing, and typesetting.

Bitcoins are specuatlive but the difference is that the purchasing power of your bitcoins are not going to be delated nearly as much as a dollar you can get from the government. The market is a cruel but fair mistress, unlike the government who is much more like a gold digger.

That is a totally different scenario and not theft either. One of money's implicit properties is that it is limited. By printing more money it would be fraud. For exmple, if I told you that you were buying a one of kind widget and there were only going to ever be 100 of them and part of their value is derived from their scarcity, then I go an make 1,000 of them and tell every buyer the same thing until they figure it out that would be fraudulent.
What the government does is even worse because they do not even let you choose the widget you buy, they force you to pay taxes in widgets, accept widgets for loans (even when the widgets are less valuable), and then outlaw alternatives (such as gold up until the 1970's) to force more widget buying even when the gig is up.

Has Sentor Tom Carper used a computer before?

I have already. I am not sure I will be there that long.

It's obviously not very evolved but I think there are getting to be enough online retailers that you could have website where people post deals. You only need a couple a day to make it work.

Its actually a pretty big office but its full of libertarian/free market types.

The only people in all of Fox who are actually free market are Stossel and Napolitano. The rest are all full of crap. I am suprised that they are letting Stossel keep his show when he is in such stark contrast to the rest of Fox. They took away Freedom Watch for the election because Napolitano refused to support Romney and stop calling bush a war criminal.

Why use Paypal when you know your customers are aware of Bitcoins?

Can't agree more. However, they do have huge advantage in the sense that Gavin is in their group.

On some of the Bitcoins I have bought I am at loss as well. However, my loss is a market one not one that can unilaterally be done by the government.
Weekly price fluctuations are not a good way to assess the stabillity or future outcome of savings. We are in the wildly volatile period of Bitcoin and it may be for a very long time, but as a adoption increases (I mean globally, not just in the US) the prices will begin to stabalize at more perdicatable deflation.
I am like you, practically all of my savings because I am young and can take a loss like that or more. You shouldn't get overly pessimistic because you bought during a run.

Dido. They are not stealing your actually physical or digital dollars but they are stealing your dollars purcahsing power and then spending it by printing more money and handing it out to the big banks who lend it back to them at very low rates.
Its also not just a matter of keeping the 'inflation rate' low such as keeping m2 (money supply) growth equal with growth in demand for dollars (stable prices). Whenever the government or a person who sells pies with tickets prints more they are taking some of the value other people have earned and given it to themsleves.

Why does it matter if it fits in the wallet exactly? It might be better off being a bit bigger so it is easier to use.
The concept is cool though about making each person a node in the network. Does anyone know about the security of such a netwrk how do they ensure privacy? Public Key encryption? What about sender privacy do they do random hops?

When will people see that government hurts the poor and downtrodden by making everything they do to make their lives better illegal or bureucratic?

I think people misunderstand what this means. I am big supporter of Bitcoin. What napster did was totally shake the Music Industry. They were centralized so they failed, but they herald in new age of content distrbution.
That said wether Bitcoin is the finale, is another issue. I think for the foreseeable future Bitcoins are it. We should be excited people are comparing this great expiriment to napster.
