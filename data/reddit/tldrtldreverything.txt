Hey, thanks for the response. 
The node chooses the transactions that paid the highest fees. When the nodes compare results from other nodes, they can easily find the one with the highest fees and choose it. Why do you need the puzzle in this case?
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:18:51
Some nodes will chose one, and some the other. Eventually one will overcome based on how much of the network they've convinced. In this case it doesn't really matter who wins because the two blocks are equivalent.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:41:24
Let's say the random decision process is "who has the higher fee" and if equal, "which transaction hash is higher". Then two transactions aren't the same and it's easy to decide which to choose. How does having a lot of nodes help you in that case?
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:05:27
You can just choose one randomly, can't you? I mean if there are two competing transactions that are double spending at the same time.
Regarding the mechanism - If I'm running a node and someone presents a legit block addition with higher fees than the current one, I can switch to it. Won't that work? Is the problem that someone can create transactions and not have them actually broadcasted?

I'm trying to understand why my suggestion doesn't work, not saying that I'm smarter than the whole crypto ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:57:24
Thanks a lot for the detailed response!
But I'm still not sure I understand. Let's say an evil member of the network broadcasts a double spend, one from Australia and one from Canada. And a full node in Australia adds a block at the same time that a full node from Canada adds a block (and others around the world). If the full nodes agree, as part of the rules of the network, that they'll all add the block with the most fees, they'll never choose both the Canadian and Australian spend in the same block, right?
In addition, why can't we assume that both the Canadian and Australian spend will spread within 60 seconds or so and then everyone has both transactions and can choose the earlier.

Thanks again for taking the time. Having 51% of the nodes doesn't help you if the honest nodes decline your transaction. That's the whole concept of a fully validating node. Perhaps someone else knows the answer?
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:09:46
Hmm the consensus issue is interesting. So the system doesn't allow you to double spend but there's no obvious way to create a block everyone agrees on. Why wouldn't a time limit solve this? Like for a block that starts at 12:00, any transaction propagated until 12:08 is valid, the others will have to wait for the next block.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:52:35
How does such an attack allow double spend? It just postpones the time when other transactions will be accepted.
What exactly do you mean by coordination problem? I suggest that around 10 minutes, more or less, nodes will propagate their blocks. The best legit block (most fees, no double spend) will be accepted by the other validating nodes. Their incentive will be the same as validating nodes today.

Eldermuerto helped me out, I think I understand now. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:11:37
The block with the highest transaction fees is accepted to the blockchain. Why doesn't that work?
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:54:50
What would happen today if some miner used a lot of proof of work without anyone knowing and then propagated his chain after 100 blocks? It would just be ignored, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:38:10
yep, got it. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:28:38
Running a node (or even 60% of the nodes) doesn't allow you to double spend because other nodes won't accept the double spending block. You only get to choose which of the double spending attempts to put in the block and that's not worth much.
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:24:25
I'm not sure I get your point. Let's say after 8 minutes every node starts propagating their block and has 1 minute to do so, then a minute or two later the one that has the most fees becomes the official block. Why won't you see the valid block? Will everyone censor you? Perhaps the issue there is that there could be two or more versions of the network and no way to reconcile them in case of some form of censorship?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:37:51
yep, got it. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:30:49
both are signed, only one transaction will be accepted in the network. What's the risk here? That a merchant will accept your transaction?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:38:25
yep, got it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:34:50
This is cool, wonder if it'll start a trend
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:32:44
The blockchain with the most accumulated fees. If the double spend includes two transactions with exactly the same fee, they'll be chosen randomly. BTW, you could also create some randomness in the least significant digits so that two transactions will never have the same exact fee.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:29:28
A node that proposes such a block needs to sign the transaction with the fee and forfeit the fee (they're not getting the reward, the fee is burnt). That wouldn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:47:35
No takers? Maybe I'll just build this and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:59:06
I actually thought about that too, why shouldn't it be like 0.001 BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:22:30
Yep. Still find it strange because it's a simple idea. I'll research it a bit more and then start coding.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:46:03
Prediction markets are actually pretty useful for real life stuff (geopolitical stuff, hedging financial bets) but that's not really the question - if people think they're useful then why aren't they doing it with smart contracts?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:28:44
I get it, thanks. Wasn't obvious to me that it's just a matter of probability and scale doesn't provide any advantage other than stability 
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:56:14
Thanks for the response. Still I'm not sure I understand - if there are two miners (I and II), if miner I is stronger couldn't they always get the reward? Statistically, couldn't II always lose?
