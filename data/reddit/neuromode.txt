Thanks for the information. I'm not sure how much Koinify skims off the top of each project, but you are right on when you say that this crowdfunding system can be simplified greatly when using Bitcoin.
Simplicity is very important all around and although that wasn't what I was highlighting in this original post it's a good point to always keep in mind when assessing the value of new companies/products utilizing bitcoin.
As for who is donating so much money to these groups....I have absolutely no clue. I would love to find out though. It's baffled me.

On Myriadcoin, this entire massive warehouse would be competing for only 1/5 the total coin rewards with other SHA256d miners.
The other 4/5 block rewards are split 4 ways--Scrypt, Skein, Groestl, and Qubit. 1/5 to each.  
Utilizing the security of ASICs while being able to mine alongside them. Yeah, Myriadcoin is the future of PoW.

The Brazillian "Myriadcoin" tokens are simply branded as "Liberdades" and this use case does not mean they arbitrarily receive any different value from the unbranded Myriadcoin tokens. They are the same coins on the same blockchain except one of them gets tagged with an extra line of code that Liberdade wallets will recognize.
The purpose is cultural appeal. Brazillian merchants can accept Liberdades knowing they were mined by a Brazillian person (or even better, someone in another country supporting Brazil by mining with a Liberdade wallet). They will have whatever value the free market decides. I personally still don't know if there may be Brazillian currency exchanges that can trade Liberdades to BRL, meaning only Liberdade coins (that are generated from mining with a Liberdade wallet daemon)  and not unbranded Myriadcoins. It would be interesting though!

If it was that simple and this idea is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, I guarantee you a couple guys would have built this shit and got it released in the four months its taken Gems to reach their milestone of "beta iphone app" that isn't hooked up to anything.
My bottomline point is Koinify's management of ICO funds is so lenient towards the dev team in this case that it's almost as if Koinify doesn't even need to moderate anything. The money is basically going to the dev team for doing nothing more than any other ICO on a normal bitcointalk thread would do.

Jesus. 
The main problem I have is Koinify awarding investors' money to projects that have nearly nothing to show at the time a milestone is reached. It's fucking reckless and it doesn't matter if that's how "things have always been done" because crypto doesn't give a shit about how things have been done in the past. 
So "lets support projects instead of tearing at them" is a dolled-up version of "Let's throw non-reversible money at ICOs on bitcointalk and hope they deliver. They promised they would deliver."
Enabling this evolved form of scam artistry can be solved with one easy step: DONT GIVE THEM THE MONEY UNTIL THE ACTUAL INNOVATION THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO GETS DONE, EVEN ON THE MOST BASIC LEVEL.

Not specifically for Myriad, just a tweet by  who already stated in his speech at the Cryptocurrency Conference in NY last week he is going to be using Myriadcoin to bring mining to Brazil. His Blocktech company has a business model in place and they are announcing news and updates as it happens. 
But for a general overview of colored coins you can go here: 
I think this is a fairly "simple" implementation of it but it can hopefully be a springboard for other people to see how to implement it. I think colored coins will gain traction if people have a nice use case to follow...and Blocktech and Myriadcoin will be a nice international example for people to follow. :)

Ah I see. That's cool that verters are so geared towards decentralization. I guess a coin really can't help if it blows up early in its life unless its purposely doing stealth launches or doing absolutely no social network integration.
Myriadcoin halves every 48 weeks (~11 months) and we are about 2-3 months in. Still plenty to go around. :)

Ah, but see... this is a Counterparty asset. So, you know, people think it's super complex and bitcoin 2.0 and this is what bitcoin was made for--to make cool shit like this, so like totally it's cool to invest in people building applications on bitcoin because that's all Andreas A. talks about and that's the type of future stuff I hear on LTB podcasts!
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:40:39
And yet nobody can hold them accountable if they can't reach their second milestone. They get hundreds of thousands of dollars after doing a ton of lobbying, then retreat into a hole and "work on the code" for months and try their darndest to reach that second milestone. But they are absolutely not held accountable by any means if they can't make it. 
Everyone looks wholesome on the surface when they are lobbying for your money. Once the money raising is over, people change because the game changes. It's just a fact, especially when they aren't held liable after creating a crowdfunding contract that pays them tons of money up front. 
Going back to my original point, you cannot do "the usual things" in cryptoland. Old models of contracting projects become a joke because payments are a way one street here. Projects are often international and people are often very disguised. Koinify is enabling a very dangerous environment, even if they aren't intending so. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:00:58
Yes. How these Koinify guys managed to raise $1M from VCs is beyond me. Where the hell is the oversight? They are going to have a legion of pissed off investors trying to find legal measures to take against them if they allow this to happen. Like I said, it might technically fall on the investors who didn't read the roadmap details completely but if so, Koinify still loses all credibility and trust, which is an incredible feat considering they use multi-sig wallets to secure investor funds.
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:18:52

Well, one of the 8 people listen on the Bitcoin Foundation Board is now a money launderer (innocent until proven guilty, but you know what I mean). Just great.
Now it's easy for anyone to make the argument that Bitcoin is just another Liberty Reserve. It's not a great argument but it's one that is incredibly easy to gravitate towards in a debate.
Huge black eye. How can the US trust the Bitcoin Foundation Board now?
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:10:31


Yes. Well said.
I don't know why you are seeing the word "server". I just copied that from the project roadmap on their website. The project, if I understand it correctly, will distribute Counterparty assets (dubbed "Gemz") to users' smartphone wallets. The "server" will exist somewhere and contain cloud messaging services and it will support counterparty integration. Why and how and what this actually means in the context of the actual app on people's smartphones I don't know. 
Somehow this app will need to figure out how to automatically deliver Gemz from an exodus address to every user based on their trust score obtained from the app itself. It needs to ensure there is no way to abuse or misrepresent trust scores, which means it needs to be able to recognize fake activity from users or bots disguised as users. It needs to be open source so everyone can see clearly what's happening with the algorithms and who is actually getting airdropped what and why. But none of this work actually needs to get done in order for the devs to get hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoins. They just need a beta iPhone app that can send messages first. Everything will come later. *Wink*

I think people are giving me a hard time because either I'm saying things they don't want other people cluing in on, they are investors of Koinify, or they are investors in Gemz. There's literally millions of dollars at stake and when people's money is on the line they get stressed and very hostile on the internet.
And yes, that's all I'm pointing out. If this is how it's going to be, crowdfunding platforms are the next evolutionary step of ICO scams and it just enables the whole subculture of evil malevolent people in cryptos to influence progress in a more negative way.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:26:00
Me too. It is the most important part of being a kickstarter for cryptocurrencies. You cannot let dev teams have half of the entire funds that were raised for such little amount of work.

I saw this message copied and pasted from bitcointalk, thanks.
Koinify can travel the world and try and solve all these problems but when push comes to shove and they use grandfathered-in methods of how to construct roadmaps and payments for an industry rampant in scams, they are going to hurt more people than they will help.
Solution? It's incredibly easy: Keep project funds locked until a project team actually delivers on the actual MEAT of the innovation they outlined. Making an iPhone app in your case that does what the description says on Koinify would warrant maybe 5% of the funds, TOPS. 
It's not your fault, hell I'd fucking sign up for a deal that gives me $100,000+ for just releasing an app for an iPhone.
Old school rules and etiquette of crowdfunding don't matter when you are dealing with crypto. Koinify fails to see this and people are going to get hurt sooner rather than later, making the thing I believe in (bitcoin's technology) become more and more malevolent in the eyes of outsiders.

You tell me right now that dev teams should get paid half up front with every project funded on Koinify and I'll tell you that coming up with ideas and a fake dev team and making a project on Koinify will be the most lucrative job in the world.

It's not Gemz I have a problem with. It's Koinify.
The main issue I had with Gemz is that they have all these visionary ideas but won't have anything to show for it until hundreds of thousands of dollars are in their hands (which is Koinify's doing). Could Gems actually deliver? Sure. But giving them so much money on hyped up ideas is the very thing that is going to attract a lot of scamming teams to use Koinify as their new platform for scams. it ruins Koinify's credibility.

Gems is a Counterparty asset. It's almost like a company releasing shares using bitcoin in this context. You hear about this stuff all the time on LTB. Counterparty is a bitcoin metalayer that people are trying fancy things on.

The main point I am making is that it is very irresponsible for a crowdfunding company to issue dev teams a cache of raised funds that is disproportional to the amount of work required to reach the milestone. 
Gems may very well not be a scam. But Koinify's roadmap milestone management is setting a terrible, TERRIBLE precedent that will surely be abused by others. You simply cannot allow hundreds of thousands of dollars to be whisked away when the entire meat of the project still hasn't even been worked on. 
Ideas are nice. Visionaries are nice. Multitudes of connections with people in the business is nice. Actually making shit work is a totally different story. Nobody's word is sacred in cryptoland.
