Yes that can happen. I once lost 500 euro that way because I sent money to the wrong bank account number.

Yes but wire transfers in the EU are irreversible so they couldn't do anything for me. The receiver refused to pay me back, so there was little they could do.

Speak for yourself. I would definitely not wait an hour in a line to buy a phone.

I really dislike apple's walled garden. Apple's history of banning bitcoin apps showed to me that apple can't really be trusted. As a result have decided to never buy an iPhone again. 
Right now I'm using a cheap android and it is just as functional as my old iPhone while being a hell of a lot cheaper.

I live in a country where credit cards are uncommon and bank wire is exactly how I pay for my coffee.

On average, one block is mined every 10 minutes. That's 52560 blocks per year. The mining reward is 12.5 bitcoins per block.
That means that miners receive 650000 Bitcoin per year as a mining reward. At the current price of 8000$ per bitcoin, that's about $5.2 Billion per year. 
With an electricity price of 0.05$/kwh, those $5.2 Billion is enough to buy 104 TWh worth of electricity.

You don't need historical data. You can verify this in a laboratory. You can put a black body emitter in a gas chamber and check how it influences the radiation balance.  
You can also verify the model with other planets with a known atmospheric composition.
We don't use historical data to create climate models. We use historical to confirm that are models are correct.

We know the absorption spectrum of all the different greenhouse gasses. We know the atmospheric concentration of the different greenhouse gasses. We know the black body radiation spectrum of the planet. With this information we can derive the relative impact of the different greenhouse gasses on the earths radiation balance.

Money doesn't disappear when a debt is repayed.  Consider the following example:
Person A owes $2 to person B.
Person B owes $2 to person C.
Person C owes $2 to person A.
Person A has $1. Person B and C have nothing.
Person A now pays $1 to person B. His debt is now $1.
Person B can now pay $1 to person C. His debt is now $1.
Person C can now pay $1 to person A. His debt is now $1.
Person A pays $1 to person B. His debt is now $0.
Person B pays $1 to person C. His debt is now $0.
Person C pays $1 to person A. His debt is now $0.
Person A now has $1 and all debts are payed off. Even though there was only $1, everybody was able to pay off their debts.

Large parts of Africa and Asia. Half of the global population earns less than $2.50 per day. ~1 billion people earn less than $1 per day.

Thera are roughly 75 bitcoins mined every hour.  $/bitcoin, that is 150,000$/hour. If you assume an electricity prices of 0,05$/kwh, you can  expect electricity consumption to be 3,000,000 kwh/hour which is equal to 3GW.

Well in that case bitcoin aren't that useful. But let's consider a different case. I for example live in Europe and it is often the case that products that are available in the US are not available in Europe or significant more expensive in Europe. 
In a lot of cases I can go to a US website and order these products online. However payment is usually a problem. I need either a credit card or USD to buy products in the US. Most Europeans don't own credit card or USD and neither do I. However I can easily buy bitcoins with my Euro's and send those bitcoins to the US as payment, which they can convert back into USD. 
So bitcoins in that sense are ideal for international transactions. Especially for online goods like video games that do not require shipping. I have often wanted to buy games on [GOG]( however I lack the means to pay for their goods. If they however accepted bitcoins, I would be able to buy their stuff without problem.

No, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve covers your deposit accounts in the case that your bank becomes insolvent. They do not protect against fraud or theft.

Well I see. That proves that information on Wikipedia is not always correct. Still, that only applies to the US though. If someone hacks my bank account or steals my PIN card, i'm pretty much screwed.
