I assume they have a full node running, hence they get the same unprocessed bulk of transactions as all other nodes (incl. miners). Analysing the transactions that are broadcasted and then constructing another transaction should be trivial in that case, also making it fully possible to include the next transaction in the same block without a problem.

I used these guides for my raspberry pi testnet node:
Setting up bitcoind and eclair (which I later switched to lnd):
This one I used to attach an external 1TB USB drivewithout an extra power supply:

It took a while for me to figure this one out, but I understand now, see below:
1. Obtain hash of genesis block (Ref: [ : `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`
2. Generate public address ([ using hash from 1. as Private Key under "Wallet Details", obtain bitcoin address: `164qRoL9B3oxAZCn2RS6kAFejJQyAEcjaw` 
3. Check resulting key to the one used in the "attack": [ ,  [ etc.
Thus, the supposed "attack" is just someone that was smart enough to monitor the funds in the bitcoin address above, used the private key which is known as the hash of the genesis block, and sent it to their own wallet.

I had the same problem but with both bitcoind and lnd. 
Try stopping the process safely using whatever way you run it, or perhaps using a cli script (bitcoin-cli stop / lncli stop / systemctl stop bitcoind / systemctl stop lnd) in my case. 
Once the process is stopped, start it again and it should verify the downloaded blocks which takes a while. 
Restart it once again and you should be running from the most current block.
Can't say the reason, but this method worked for me.

This is the one I'm learning from:

Ah that is unfortunate. I was wrestling with eclair before switching over to lnd, and if you want to test out the lightning network, that might be worth trying. Otherwise, if you solve this issue and write about it, would be great for the community!
