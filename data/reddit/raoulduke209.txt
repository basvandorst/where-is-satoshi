[There We Go](
Took a little longer than ten minutes but it seems you're right. I didn't want to go asking people for money to be sure my wallet works so I figured this would work. Thought for a minute it backfired and wasn't working but you're right and it worked. 
Yay for my first 7 cents worth of bitcoin! Haha
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:57:34
If so... what are confirmations and... how do I make them happen? 
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:47:47
I didn't see that "average" sorry if I seemed condescending. 
People use bitcoins for coffee??? 
I have a world to learn.
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:12:05
Because bitcoins are phenomenal. There is just dust laying around. 
I shoot little space ships... penny dust. I flap bird against somebody penny dust. I roll dice penny dust. 
Faucets leaking little fractions of cents. Makes me feel like wasting my time is almost worth it. 
Primedice has given and taken thousands of fractional penny flakes to me and from me.

I am a luxurious prince from Zimbabwe in need of American refuge! All my funds (trillions of dollars) need to come with me to the us of a. I cannot bring them on my person as I may get robbed. But you can western union me $400 for transfer fees and I will send you 99999999.00btc
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:31:56
Damn that's all I did. I accumulated enough change on mycelium through games to take that money to primedice and gamble it. Immediately.
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:57:10
Wha? I can't even get 0.001btc ! 
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:09:22
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:11:23
The transfers shown there are winnings from a game (app) on my phone.
I didn't have any way to send myself funds as I've never used bitcoins or any digital currency before.
So I decided what better way to check if I can receive btc than win/earn it haha. 
So I got those transfered to me... just not showing up in my Balance. 
Also. Once those showed up, there was a second private key on my account is that normal?
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:11:38
Kind of makes sense. Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:16:34
What?! Wow... So that's real? 
Thank toy I like how that works. 
I appreciate it man.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:47:57
How low is it now? I regret spending tens of bitcoins on drugs lol
