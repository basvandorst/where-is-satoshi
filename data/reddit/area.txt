I found a similar exploit a year or two ago on a website. In that case, the exploit was... click the withdraw button twice quickly.

Sure, they link to an address that has sufficient BTC in it. I don't see how they've proved ownership of that address though?

I disclosed the problem responsibly to the site owner, they fixed it, and they let me keep the extra BTC I had acquired as thanks, which at the time was ~$100, if I recall correctly.
I then stopped using the website.

I've thrown this up as a [gist]( Once you trust this is just a copy/paste of the source (modulo ',' characters), you can do
    curl  | g++ -O0 -xc++ - &amp;&amp; ./a.out
    curl  | g++ -O2 -xc++ - &amp;&amp; ./a.out
To compare the behaviours. **Note that it is extremely bad practise to download, compile and run code blindly in this fashion. Do not make it a regular habit, or even do it in this instance.**

GmbH is equivalent to saying 'Limited', just in German. It means that the company has a particular legal status. A more informative statement would be 'Mike Hearn of Vinumeris'.

This isn't correct. They do not charge 2% of your bitcoin holdings per annum. They charge you 2% of the cover you've asked for, which is specified in GBP, and then charge you that much in bitcoins based on the exchange rate.
So, for example, if I want to let them store 10BTC, and be covered for £10000 in losses (i.e. up to £1000 per BTC), I will be charged £200 per annum, or 0.034BTC per month at current exchange rates.

There definitely are people with enormous stashes of Litecoins, most of which were obtained by GPU mining prior to it being generally available.

Way back when (i.e. 2010), there was a bug that someone exploited that spawned 184 billion bitcoins. It required a hard fork to fix. It was okay at the time, because it was early days, but it's fair to say that if this happened these days, the value of bitcoin would probably tank for the foreseeable future.

A new update on the site:




This is also presumably related to the host of emails I woke up to from my bot, this morning:


@_date: 2013-07-06 18:06:44
It always surprises me how many people don't actually know how many coins are mined per day, or at least how that compares to volumes seen on exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:23:13
But if you had bought the coins instead of spending the money on the electricity...

I'm not sure I understand what you're asking here; my intention is to maximise the BTC generated by your equipment. At the moment, it is more profitable to mine LTC and sell it for BTC than to mine for BTC directly.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:43:18
Well, they emailed me and they're going to debit the consequences of this error from my account, so it doesn't look like it's going to work out as well as it could have done for me! At least everyone is going to have their funds returned though.

What's an order of magnitude between friends?
EDIT: No, I'm the moron, though they have inserted the commas in a bizarre fashion in that number.
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:14:18
Incredulous that something like this didn't already exist, I've thrown together a script that will switch between BTC mining and LTC mining based on their relative profitability.
EDIT: By way of explanation, currently it's much more profitable to mine LTC and sell for BTC, on the order of 150%
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:44:02


Citation? Because this seems preposterous.
EDIT: Loving the downvotes despite correctly calling this claim as wrong (see below - the correct fact is the 300 richest people on Earth have the same combined wealth as the poorest 3 billion people).

You mean don't use a brainwallet that you've thought of.
Using a brainwallet produced by a true random process e.g. [Diceware]( is fine. A twenty-word long diceware passphrase using the standard implementation recovers the 256 bits of entropy you mention.

Exactly right, and this difficulty adjustment occurs every 2016 blocks (or approximately two weeks - but if the network hashrate shot up, then these 2016 blocks would be mined much quicker than two weeks before the adjustment occurred).

Outside of BTC, this would be viewed as an absolutely incredible return.
I'm not saying OP is wrong in saying mining isn't worth getting into, but we have to remember to look at the bigger picture here.

I can't see a way that my bot would have been placing hundreds of these orders in such quick succession; my best guess is that my bot placed a trade in good faith, and then something went screwy on VirCurEx's side.

The point is that HMRC view bitcoin not as a foreign currency (for which you correctly assert that an exchange can operate tax free) but as a commodity (which an exchange must charge VAT for if it exceeds a certain volume threshold).

This is Oxford Dictionaries Online (ODO) which, while run by the same people, is separate from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) which is generally seen as the most prestigious dictionary, and probably what most people think the headline means. ODO focusses on current language, whereas the OED is a reference of the history of the language. ODO has 'twerk' in it, for example, but OED does not, and the same is (currently) true of 'bitcoin'.

Ah, right, which is why the brainwallet phrase only needs to be 12 words long (which is often quoted) rather than the 20 I calculated, was a little confused by, and then posted anyway.

You have a couple of replies suggesting that miners, and whether they hoard their mined coins or not, are a major factor in the price of bitcoins.
This is not true. The 24 hour volume on Bitstamp is 10844 BTC, and on MtGox it's 13000BTC. The total number of bitcoins mined in a day is 3600BTC. It's clear that miners selling their newly minted coins are not the majority of the trade seen on the exchanges.

ASICs entering the market won't cause any more BTC to appear than if ASICs didn't exist. Blocks will still be generated 1 per 10 minutes on average, causing BTC to be created at a rate of 25 per 10 minutes.
