Fun fact, he also said
“Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers.”
Then was accused and killed for corrupting the youth, among some other things.
"Socrates is guilty of crime in refusing to recognise the gods acknowledged by the state, and importing strange divinities of his own; he is further guilty of corrupting the young." 
I for one am happy embracing new ways and sharing opinions is generally more accepted this days.

In the qt client, click 'help', 'debug window', 'console'.
Type, listaddressgroupings to get a list of addresses including any change addresses that might have been created you're not aware of.
Then type, dumpprivkey yourpublickey

That really is great timing, I almost bought a MalwareBytes PRO licence last night in a rush. Glad I waited, now I can buy it with Bitcoins! Absolutely Amazing News!!!

As was previously mentioned, you could try importing the privkey with Bitcoin-qt into a new wallet and double spend the balance with a fee. Worth a try.

I seem to get errors on process_register.php
[Error Screenshot](
Users are being created in the SQL database with the password hash, I can login with the username and password I set but I don't see anything other than an orange bar.
I've emailed info with no reply so was wondering if this was still being worked on?
