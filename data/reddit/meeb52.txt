I have a good laugh on ‘interesting logos’ part. That’s what I did too to skim through ridiculous list of shit coins. Most of them turn into real shit. Lucky me there’s one that actually perform very well.

May I know if you had gotten back in the game? Even with higher price than what you sold (after you’re certain it’s not going back down that low). Really wonder how’s that work since it could happen to anyone during the bull run.  Thanks!

Awesome where can I follow you guys. Would be interested to use the product. Thanks.

Yup i drew the exact conclusion before getting in. Adding to your point, this is why some are recommending the nay sayer to just put 0.5% of their savings in. Then if fiats evaporate and this thing goes 300 folds, you would end up losing nothing. Of course if lambos mean anything to you why not own more.
EDIT: back when it was 1,000 apparently

I didn’t mention bitcoin solving inequality at all. 
If you mean why I am guessing properties will become cheaper in general and less as a speculative instrument or SOV. 
I would say not by bitcoin directly but by the debt base system declining on it owns. In your scenario, no central banks.  If that is happening, it is because their debt is pilling too much not because bitcoin. Then people cannot get big loans for a while in case the smart contracts tech is not matured yet.  When no money means no money. Either you sell the properties at deep discount or you left them empty and absorb depreciations. Talking about history of lending yes it’s dated back some thousands years. But not until this recent few decades that the ridiculously long-term ones like 30-50 years term exists (please correct me if those were common for much longer). 
So for me the question is not why would I choose bitcoin over central banks. It is more like if central banks collapse, are there anything better than bitcoin.

My guess is most properties will be forced to become much cheaper you don’t need the mortgage. The prime areas will still be affordable by bigbois only. The rest of us can just rent those places. Though housing in general will be priced back to their real value to live, not to speculate. Which would be in-line with population growth and inflation rate, not tremendously out pacing them like it did in the past few decades.

Do your monthly fiat shaving. When it’s your country turn. Jokes on them.

I would rather ask myself this;
- In 10 years what is the probability that a bitcoin is going to cost less than 50k. 
- Are there any banks out there that can offer 10 years accumulated savings interests up to  5X your initial savings?
- Why I put my savings in the bank?
While most predictions think 50k definitely happens during next halving, though even it happens in the next 10, 20, 30 years. Still far better than money in the banks. Unless you plan to use these sums in the near future, in that case you shouldn’t make any investments.

They will pump until everyone gets over these signs and call it “this time is different”, “negative interest rates kinda make sense”, then pop! out of nowhere. Not when everybody is cautious like you do now.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:12:12
guess this is the level where TA guys who called 2k missing out 3-4k and called 5k missing out 7.5k, start to buy in. cus there aren’t many reasons to sell here for those who were in pre-1k, 20k, 6k, 3k, 10k, 7.5k and still hold til now. Yup on the sideline watching price hang 3-6k for a year and get in at 9k.

I think mr. wiener meant if the price drops by $1000 from the current value, not dropping to 1k which is totally possible but still.. don’t be that TA guy.
@_date: 2019-12-27 06:17:09
That sounds bad. In a bull market btc dominance will most likely drop because load of new pre-mined shitcoins will be created and jack up the total crypto market value. I prefer 100,000 usd/btc at 60% dominance over 1,000 usd/btc at 90% dominance any day.

Isn’t that less than what one’d earn working at mc donalds? I mean if you only dealing with vendors and logistic services operating 100% in crypto like your business. I don’t see your earnings being a factor that force you to comply with regulation.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:00:49
fair point. i’m much more bullish than the hypothesis i made of course. tho even bitcoin lost its stance for some sheeple coins in the future and couldn’t reach 1m per coin. still the hardest money on earth by design. It’s not going away anytime soon

If you plan to buy quite substantial amount, try searching for “bitcoin otc [type your area]” (just google that). ATM most likely charge some stupid premium fees.

I have found him occasionally contradict himself toward different audiences to push his agenda which so far I agree with. That is just my assumption and why I’m not hating on some of the stuff he said. For instance he once said something like never buy bitcoin just earn them. Then in other talks he mentioned using exchanges to purchase them.

I was pointing out on your impatient and the unrealistic expectation on evolution of this technology. Regarding resistance against any states, bitcoin is the best tool. 
1. You don’t loose your wealth in a long term (don’t have to convert all you have got, just the long term saving part) 
2. You drastically decrease demand of your government fiat. 
3. Collapse the local currency
4. Reduce local banks liquidity
5.  Government collapse or civil war
6. You remain wealthy and free regardless
That’s why some say bitcoin is the most peaceful revolution.

When I see this it always make me wonder on those folks who hang around this sub for years and still don’t get it, thinking bitcoin is a ponzi and what not. 
Regardless of which economic ideas camp your are on. These facts should settle the debate. Bitcoin is no shit. 
1. The size of mining industry now imagine manufactured equipments, facilities and money that exclusively dedicate for crypto mining job. 
2. The fact that it has never been hacked. 
3. Hashing powers
4. The price action. Every bottoms of big cycle crashes are forming higher than the previous ATH.  
5. No chance the network could be forced to shut down permanently before human extinction.
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:47:03
There are magnitudes of collapsing. It might be just changing of government body in most cases which doesn’t shut down the internet. Though if it escalates to a war or stateless land then move the f*** out of there. And people with bitcoin got the best chance of bringing majority of their wealth with them to the new country.
