i agree mostly, upvoted because i dont think it deserves negative karma.
i just disagree with:


not necessarily, we actually just need more people coming into the Bitcoin space and increasing the market cap. If there is an "equal loss" needed for a "win" then one person wins, not everyone, if you buy cheap coins from someone, that person selling lost out, and you gain, NOT everyone. for everyone to gain we need the market cap to go up which is caused by adoption.
EDIT: if you are saying: someones loss is another's win then yes, i agree

I never said they will never get it. they don't currently get it, that is because they only read headlines from the news and just imagine it to be a facebook or twitter company.
It will have wide spread adoption, we are continuously moving in that direction. That being said widespread adoption does not mean it will replace fiat altogether, or replace the banking systems. It will live along side it and be good option for payment online.

Thats why i changed Mycelium wallet display unit to uBTC. With the huge rise in value we've seen in Bitcoin over the last 2 years (and probably much more to come), its kind of necessary.

If businesses require payment from certain white addresses it just wont catch on. there is no way it can get to that point. people wouldnt use it therefore these rules will exists to serve no one.
Edit: if a country COULD enforce this for businesses in their borders, people in that country wont use it. it will be used like normal in some other countries which are lax on regulation. There is no way this becomes centralized without it all failing

same could be said about the price in the last 6 months: why hasn't it gone up by 1000%?
What im saying is this takes time, things come in cycles.
It shouldn't worry you, we are still building the infrastructure for the mainstream to adopt... we are building security and ease of use (by we i mean the programmers and startups) this will allow for greater adoption in the long run. new companies accepting it wont make a difference on its own.

i wouldn't call it greed, investing or putting money into something for whatever reason and whatever you call it isn't greedy, why is it automatically assumed when someone makes a lot of money that they are greedy. it happens and doesn't always have to be in a dodgy manner or to a bad person. Wealth (even wealth gained easily by a speculative investment that works out better than expected) doesn't necessarily make you a greedy person. Its a massive generalization to say "everyone got greedy".
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:48:50
Bitcoin can still be spent without it. it seems like giving up A LOT of security for minimal convenience gain. I mean it seems to me the exact same thing as "i dont want to enter my credit card number and expiration date all the time, how about i use a browser extension that stores all my credit card info nice an secure and encrypted, and have it auto fill my info when i want to buy something". browsers have too many exploits, there are too many people not keeping them up to date to make browsers good for anything sensitive. I guess this is an opinion since i dont have any sources, i base my opinions on what i read on NakedSecurity news and TheHackerNews.

I agree with StayPolite. But i also tried the MicroWallet, just to see how faucets work. It does pay out, i got two payouts to a Mycelium HD wallet i wanted to test as well (and to keep it separate from my bought BTC). so i think you are wrong. MicroWallet does have a minimum payout threshold though, and the amount of satoshis you get for the click farming is retardedly low, but it does pay out, as of a week ago.

I have not seen any obvious terrorists on this subreddit yet. ill keep my eyes open. maybe we can start a terrorist watch list for the users of bitcoin, add all known watchlist addresses to a NoTransactionList in the code, then get the exchanges to racially discriminate when ID's that are sent in of people who look of a race that could be a terrorist.
FYI this was a fun sarcastic post, i do not support anything i make fun of in this post, and terrorism is some BS term that can be applied to anything you dont agree with or when you want to strike fear/anger in people, the term is used for control. 'Merica

the massive increase in price was speculatory investments... it wasn't about mass adoption, so its granted that the price increased so much.
Its not only a payment method (especially not yet)
 -its a speculative investment
 -its a way to remit
It has many uses, it just started with speculation - mass adoption will be coming over time and this will ALSO increase the price. but so far its traders and investment that has given it the price rises

all that information on the "tracked" coins can be circumvented by sending it to a different address. the information on who owns the bitcoin will be WRONG. I register my address, i send bitcoin to my friends wallet, now i do not own that bitcoin any more, they going to lock me up now? their database is now wrong about who owns the portion of btc i just sent to my friend, now he goes and tips someone on the internet and the coins are on the other side of the world with a new anon owner....... This will not work

For phone wallets i use an already created wallet from a PC wallet, and just save the private key on the phone wallet (import an already existing key), that way its backed up and can be recovered on any PC/PC wallet, or from a paper wallet, AND can be spent from my phone using MyCelium.
if you are going to keep coins on a phone wallet... why not just back up the keys? this seems logical? phones get stolen and wiped all the time, this will protect from bugs AND theft [EDIT: theft of phone, not btc]. pretty much any wallet needs back ups right?
If its not possible to create a backup that can be recovered from ANY other wallet then just create one and import them to the phone wallets like i do.

What you are suggesting is that the government (of the US) will find a way to maintain their own ledger, are label and track all coins? essentially making it centralized. This is impossible, it is DESIGNED to not be central. And barring complete control over miners it wont be possible.
The only way this system you suggest will work is if they control the regulations on ALL the retailers, in ALL countries all over the world, without full control none of it will work.

A bit offtopic: What are the fees using Multibit 0.5.18? i read somewhere they are implementing fees for transactions that go to the developers... when is this change going to be implemented? and will it affect the current versions (is it optional to not upgrade to a newer version?)

ah yes, ive been following the development of Multibit HD, i thought they were going to start charging fees on both. thanks for the answer

When you suggest wallets please also suggest Lite wallets like Multibit and MyCelium and explain the difference. this is VERY important -&gt; here in South Africa even with a 4mb uncapped line like i have (not even that common is SA let alone the rest of Africa) its unfeasible to run a full node, new users will get a shock when their wallet is unusable for days and eats up their mobile data.

he says "... im sure...", this comes off as an opinion after having been shown evidence by Mark K. Maybe he was being mislead too. You guys are on a witch hunt, and accuse him of everything except being the devil himself. Im not on any side of this "debate" but this community has become something that reminds me of the SJW communities.
and what is disappointing to me is that this is the *decentralized block-chain* we are talking about. Where *anyone* should be able to have an opinion and be a part of the bitcoin community, it should be all inclusive.

This seems to be the objective, I doubt its even meant to have security.

that's a great idea /s, from what i hear of cops in America, grabbing a sharp object like scissors when a cop is approaching your window will most likely get you shot a few times, then beaten, and if you survive the gunshots you'll be brain damaged.
In fact there's a higher than should be chance of that happening even without the scissors.

i agree with a temporary price drop, and over the mid term wont have much effect, but i disagree on the reasons, i dont think is weak hands, its more like manipulators and big traders taking profits, adjusting positions. big sells to take profit and push price low, small buys to buy cheaper coins and make price rise again, rinse and repeat, and its seems they use news as a vehicle to help them create waves

yeah i kinda hope mr robot turns out to be real, but ive found so many scenes that seem to be shot in a specific way to cast that doubt, maybe thats all they want to do; cast doubt on what elliot sees, whats real and whats in his head.. im enjoying the series a lot so far either way
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:35:45
its all on the OP's link, just read and scroll down.
its an emerging-market bitcoin exchange e.g South Africa BTC-ZAR and also web-wallet ect
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:49:36
Have you watched fight club? its like that, in more ways than you think. Not only in similar project mayhem style adgenda.
It doesnt seem like you have noticed that elliot is not being manipulated by the "hacker" mr robot, he IS mr robot.
Not once in the series does anyone other than elliot interact with mr. robot (except for the men in suits that also dont exist). he is skitso, he made YOU up you the viewer as his "friend", mr robot is his other side, HE put together the hacker group, this is why the last thing Mr robot says after pushing elliot off the ledge is "YOU didnt commit to the sacred pact YOU formed", also in the second episode when "mr robot" addresses the hackers he walks up to elliot and stands infront of him with his back turned to elliot to address the group, not once do anyone in the group (already standing around elliot) even look at mr robot, they keep looking at elliot. its like this through the whole series, there are way more examples i can point out but you get the idea.
Elliot is a delusional, drug addicted, sometimes suicidal, skitso hacker with a grudge against the comapny that killed his father... WHOISMRROBOT.com ? that is the series website. he is elliot, he is pretty much tyler durden, thats who he is.
They paint the corparations as evil, exploitative of their employees, they show the hackers as misguided kids, hacktavists, some hacking anything just for the fun (the dark army and the chick)
all shades of grey, especially elliots white hat and black hat sides. he is litterally a grey hat hacker because of his two personalities


watch it again, see, listen and think.

it's programmable money, extremely fast and cheap to send micro transactions: perfect for the internet of things.... not anymore
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:25:50
Yeah i think so too...Second episode: he walks out on the hacker group, takes a lot of drugs, talks about depression/suiside with the drug dealer, at the end Mr Robot talks to him about his dad, asks him if he is to blame, pushes him off, his reasoning: "YOU walked out on the sacred packed YOU formed", but elliot didnt start the hacker group or come up with the plan, or so it seems.
Also earlier when he walked into the arcade, hackers group around him, Mr robot is playing games in the background,  walks up to the group and stands right infront of elliot to address the group, then walks away, not once from the begining of that scene did anyone other than elliot even so much as look at Mr robot. They look directly at elliot the entire time
He talks to us (the audience, as an entity he made up in his head), so he IS skitso
also the website for the show is WhoIsMrRobot.com

Yeah i want to try and avoid Forex as much as I can, also ive been into bitcoin for years and this will be a good experiment to try and use it for goods/services, as my country is pretty limited for options to use it other than the local exchange. Interested to see how much i can save compared to changing currencies.

Are people trying to give away their money as fast as they can to strangers, is that where we are at with the internet in 2017?

*government fuck up, actually, or more accurately: dictatorship working as intended.
Look we all hate banks here, and there is plenty dodgy stuff and fuck ups that we can shit on the banks for, but this is not one of them

Unfortunately here in South Africa there are very limited ways to spend bitcoin. Online stores and possibly for hotels and things like that but dont expect to find restaurants or bars accepting it.
Other payment processors like snap scan are a lot more common here in Cape Town, in time i can seeing these being replaced by Bitcoin, but as of now its not the case :(

What do you mean by "the first fictional novel built around bitcoin"?
"In 2018 I am also famous as one of bitcoin's biggest proponents" -fap fap fap
"sounds crazy"  this post summed up, i dont get it, are you talking to the future, as if its from the future?

at this point i think this is just straight up trolling.

Mycelium allows you to import a single address private key^
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:17:08
Its legal in South Africa although its not listed on that wiki page at all. We have a good, local exchange which follows the countries KYC rules and our banks have no problem with deposits or withdraws from the exchange.
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:41:29
You can have the same wallet on your phone, just create the single wallet private key on your computer wallet, then scan the private key in to MyCelium for your phone to have access from your phone

If you release it like its a scam, expect people to treat it like a scam. Don't come cry when your scam gets called out.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:16:20
just curious, did you figure out a good strategy?
and i agree fully.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:11:35
im surprised you arent upvoted more for this. this seems like a perfect way for the creators of the mmm scheme to take money out, by sending it to a btc trading account in china and hiding the bitcoin purchases in the fake volume. this would explain the massive price moves up from china

To whoever bought this "rock", bitcoin HAS NO VALUE to them. What are they going to do with bitcoin? This post is unrelated to bitcoin.

They are trying to destroy credit, banks, and the 'current' money system.
@_date: 2016-07-14 07:42:13
also its perfect that they waited until season two to start bringing it in, what with ransomware making an appearance and the credit system/bank crisis having happened. this is what gets the shops on the corner to start using it.

And is being limited more and more everyday. Limits on how much cash can be used to purchase something, limits to carrying cash over the boarders and limits to withdraws. All of these limit the use of cash way more than BTC at the moment, so cash isnt too much of a problem for them.

Who cares, we all see America is not as powerful as it used to be.
"including it in the list of monetary instruments that must be reported when entering or leaving the US." Good fucking luck. Bitcoin never gets transported, its always on the blockchain, only the cryptographic private keys get transported. If anyone really wants to move a private key and puts some time in to secure it, good luck finding it, its not in your pocket or hidden in your baggage, its on the god damn blockchain. Its not something you can stop entering your country

It's not Bitcoin, its Bitfinex and Tether they are after.


That's what governments do when you do illegal shady shit with millions of peoples money.
