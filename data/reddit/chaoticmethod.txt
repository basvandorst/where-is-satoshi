lol. Teach me, master. We're not worthy of your investing prowess.

It’s a great book. One of my favorites.

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

What? How? You can't use bitcoin right now (Although you can, and people are using it for many things) because the blocksize is small and transactions are slow and expensive. Other cryptos solve those problems. So what is the same problem that they will have?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:18:02
If you thought I was being condescending then you're wrong. Sorry for the miscommunication and sorry you're such a prick.
"A decentralized currency was defined by the US Department of Treasury as a "currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort".[2] Rather than relying on confidence in a central authority, it depends instead on a distributed system of trust."
So... your definition is wrong.


This is the dumbest and least practical idea I've ever heard. You live in a fantasy-land.

Any clue what the difference is between Zcash and Monero? Do they fill the same use niche?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:54
I'm not sure I understand your point. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are two forks of bitcoin (changes to the code) that have less energy requirements. And proof of stake cryptos are even more energy efficient. So the reason to use more energy than required is simply because the community hasn't yet agreed on a replacement plan. They will in time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:55:05
You are the joke.
There is no reason to believe we can't approach an incredibly energy efficient form of processing. And not only that, proof of stake cryptos use a fraction of the energy that POW cryptos use. So the point is moot either way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:07:41
Because the other forms solve the transaction problems with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:45:45
If you think it is only useful as a currency then you are ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:09:24
It’s “impossible” to establish a fair valuation of the USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:09:30
That's not what people mean by decentralized. And still, the few thousand users with 40% are not in cahoots. They are their own entities.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:04:58


It is extremely valuable as a store of value. It will overtake the offshore banking industry worth $43 trillion. Or it will be used as a much more practical commodity like gold (worth $7 trillion) to hedge accounts in times of economic downturn. Institution want into bitcoin and it will be worth A LOT when they really start buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:57:23
The code can change to decrease energy consumption. It hasn’t so far, and that’s why people are using other cryptos, but it can. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:56:17
It’s an asset that is absolutely worth what people are paying for it. Wall Street money will start pouring in next year and we’ll see it double or triple again. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:30:53
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:08:45


Because we're at the start of an adoption curve. There is a transfer of wealth from fiat to crypto happening. Volatility will settle over time.


Immediately. And it's more than in writing, it's in a futures exchange. Wall Street is *already* touching it. That's why prices went up so much recently.


When ETFs come it will be even more proof that mainstream adoption has occurred and the price will stabilize even more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:22:19
that is such a tiny portion of the total usage of bitcoin it is negligible.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:03:12
Maybe. I would appreciate if you know of any sources where I could learn about energy use in cryptocurrencies. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:08:22
Ok, don’t buy it then. Some of us can make some educated guesses about the future and start planning now. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:10:09
The thing is, bitcoin requires *processing power*, not energy. Thermodynamics is not the issue. What would you say if an energy-free processing method were developed?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:47:02
I see. I like the idea of privacy in transactions. Maybe I'll buy into both of these coins.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:57:58
And so other cryptos will take over. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:29:56
No, there are no trade-offs for many of the other coins. What is the trade-off for litecoin? Or Bitcoin Cash? They are faster and lighter with fewer fees. The only problem is that their adoption rate isn't as great as bitcoin (yet).
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:46:14
Thank you. Guess I have some more reading to do on this topic.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:29:56
Oh, I get it. You're mad at me because you think my communism statement was an attack on communism. And you're a late-stager. No, I am a late-stager myself. I am not anti-communist, but I am a pragmatist. Please explain how you'll get (wealthy and powerful) people to agree to a system that limits their ability to accumulate wealth?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:54:31
Your definition of decentralized implies that there can be no unequal distribution of currency, because that is how “influence” arises. I’m sorry, but I don’t see a system where this is possible except maybe a pure communistic government run currency. If you have any alternative ideas, please share!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:00:04
Well, Wall Street has already begun “touching”
Bitcoin. CME futures trading opened with 100 billion pledged for contracts. And more vehicles for bitcoin trading are planned for the future. 
And I suggest you do some research on fiat currencies to see why your valuation argument is flawed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:07
You’re being purposely obtuse. Bye. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:57:02
Lol. You don’t just trade an asset as soon as the price starts dropping. That’s not how it works. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:47:56
Yeah it works like that in hindsight. You can’t predict when an asset will keep dropping or start going back up as soon as you sell. If you really think you’re making accurate prediction, you’re wrong. You’re just getting lucky. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:30:09
something doesn’t need to have intrinsic value to attain a steady value. But regardless, bitcoin does have intrinsic value.
