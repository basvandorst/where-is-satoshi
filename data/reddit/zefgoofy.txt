Not really, from where I come... every kick in the ass is a step forward, so if you think it on a long-term... this should've happen, so that the Bitcoin Core will get legitimacy and hopefully others will understand that nobody can mock the entire idea of what Bitcoin is supposed to be.
To be honest, I feel pity for BU devs... hey have some skills, which they could use for their own blockchain without getting themselves dirty in the whole Cryptoworld.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:24:16
Agreed! No BU should be here
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:32:30
And this makes you nothing more than an accomplice to murder of Bitcoin... just by posting this
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:29:04
You are right at so many levels... but wrong at the most important, as even this post makes publicity to BU.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:42:01
!doh... finally I sold everything, thank you... you saved my life!

Security through obscurity it's exactly what created the biggest security breaches within the internet world.
Once again, BU just proved they have absofuckinglutelly no idea what they are doing. We should trust them, right?
Yet, they have some followers (bots mostly, but hey they count as followers, too) and there they come, spikes in BU nodes, whenever a botnet fails.

You should consider resetting all your passwords, that's a start... there's nothing wrong to be paranoid and have unique passwords for each account, as much 2FA as possible and hardware wallets as well.

\--- I would've donated some sathoshies for this post/answer if I'd still had some, hopefully some lnd advocate sees my comment and give you both a lntip 5000 :D this was a really good exercise for tech bitcoiners

Spoiler alert: **CUSTODIAN** with **AML/KYC** by card you pay with... that's a **NO NO**
** - NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN**
With this gift card, you don't get bitcoins... you get an account in Canadian Dollars, on a custodian wallet (soon exchange) with 10% more fees... which later you'll swap to bitcoin and withdraw (theoretically) - slow and complicated.
You would be better off to simply play the 2.5% fees of credit card purchase... fast and simple and you own the keys, you own the bitcoin... cheaper and safer than any "super duper gift card shit".
Downvoted - there's more marketing shit than bitcoin shit here.

If you could only stand by Bitcoin... you would've got upvoted, unfortunately, just by "and other 3523e8" other crypto doesn't really make up enough room for the real crypto revolution you'd wish for.
Next time, I may ask you to think it through...
1. You want each Bitcoin at $10k  
or 
2. 3523e8 other cryptos (including Bitcoin) at $0.0001 each
Be wise young man! Stop supporting shitcoins...they'all all based on I0U kinda shit of "i can do better than satoshi, whoever they are"

Just to be clear... "not your keys, not your bitcoin!" you could teach yourself at 
You're in Coinbase for trading? Then suffer my friend... as soon as you give Coinbase your bitcoin, they do fractional-reserve-kinda with your money, basically not a single difference compared to fiat... and even worse if you consider it's still a non-regulated market as of yet (a regulation would imply that Coinbase is forced to answer phone calls).
Long-story-short, as soon as you send your bitcoin to any exchange, be it Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitmex, whateverBitX... you allow Bitcoin to drop in value, you allow fiat billionaires feed on your work.
You want to see Bitcoin Learn the freaking phrase " - NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN" and dream at it day and night until it fit in your motto!
Now, it would be great if you could stop complaining about this shit... it's your own fault, get educated and stop crying! You're in Bitcoin for quick gain? Get in your corner and die crying... you're in for the possible outcome, freedom, privacy? Get your Bitcoins out of nefarious control!
Once again... get ready to get  by Proof-of-Keys event at 3rd January 2020
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:41:28
This would be the second event and I do believe it will have more participants than the first one and so on.We gotta see this event in the news to actually get real traction

Useless site. Create one year ago and nobody maintains it. Their main post states they have their own escrow... unfortunately: "This domain may be for sale."

Who's that homeless guy sitting between them? I think I've seen him in many pictures related to BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:51:19
Mate, you really scare the s&amp;*t out of me! How is this possible?
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:54:30
** - NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN**
You want to make use of bitcoin? Buy and sell stuff...   
You want to kick Bitcoin in it's balls... give your keys to exchanges!  
You want to make a quick-buck? Then stop complaining... it's on you this one.  
You want to play with bitcoin? You just got played, dear friend
Once again... get ready to get  by Proof-of-Keys event at 3rd January 2020
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:49:26
For real?!?! A homeless guy can actually bring so much damage to BTC????

You must be really frustrated :|

It's a subreddit that it's not maintained, as long as they can't even manage their own website, but still keep it on the first most important post on their subreddit... clearly demonstrate the professionalism.
I'm not looking for $20 kids job to paint a reddit wall.
