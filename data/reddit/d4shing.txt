Dangerous indeed. Hopefully, wise governments will figure out a way to force people to do safe things with their money, like buy Italian government bonds.

In Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*, the rise of crypto-currency was what destroyed traditional territorial nation-states. The governments had no way to collect taxes on transactions, income or wealth, so they all went bust.
It would not surprise me at all if certain broke countries eventually decided that bitcoin needed to be shut down (you know, because of terrorists and pedophiles) and it became a crime to have a bitcoin wallet without giving the government your ID, for businesses to accept payment in bitcoin, etc.
First, though, it (or something like it) needs to become much more popular.

But they haven't always been, right? That's why they passed the act establishing deposit insurance in the wake of the crash of '29. And S&amp;Ls were uninsured in the 80s, causing billions of losses and numerous criminal investigations. To say nothing of the huge losses to investors and creditors that bank failures (e.g. Lehman) has caused lots of people (who, granted, were not depositors). I don't think it's controversial to say that traditional banks have caused much, much greater losses. I agree on the rest (cold wallets good, etc).

Speculation as to the amount and nature of actual or anticipated government influence on these very large and highly regulated companies is left as an exercise for the reader. But yeah, I believe it happened at one point.

Because it's impossible to counterfeit the output of the sort of cryptographic operations inherent in the nature of bitcoin - in fact, that's the entire point of the currency.

Sounds pretty insecure to me -- over a million dollars has been lost! Quick, does anyone know if any US banks have ever lost money?

So, what you're saying is: "Your Honor, I didn't *create* the currency myself, I merely joined a collective (whose purpose was to create such currency and distribute it to its members) and the collective created the currency." Do you think that will keep you out of jail? I don't. I guess you can try, though, if you wind up in such a situation.


As long as you never exchange your BTC for money issued by a government, such as US Dollars, you're fine. If you do, and you don't do all of the things above, you're technically breaking the law. If you use your GPU to make $500 a year, are the feds going to come after you? Probably not (unless they otherwise hate you/want to make an example out of you, like Aaron Swartz).
Yes, it is guidance. However, it is guidance issued by an administrative agency charged with administering and enforcing the laws it is giving guidance about. This makes it almost as good as law. See

I'm not sure why people are happy about this.
If you are a miner (who sells your mined coins for USD or other fiat), you are now a *money transmitter* per FinCEN's regulations.
If you are an exchange, you are now a *money transmitter* **and** *an exchanger* per FinCEN's regulations.
The correct response is not "Yay now it's legal!" but "Oh shit now it's subject to a bunch of regulations that are very expensive to comply with, so it's probably illegal."
Anyways, both are Money Services Businesses (**MSB**), which are defined in the statute as a kind of **Financial Institution** (but not a Bank). 31 CFR 1022 enumerates the requirements for MSBs in particular, but they're basically the same as the general FI requirements.
**Financial Institutions** must:
* Report any transaction over $10,000 (either individual transactions or all transactions in aggregate over a year which work out to &gt;$10k)
* Collect and verify identification information (including SSN/TIN, name, address)
* Establish anti-money-laundering programs
* File suspicious activity reports where appropriate
* Report all movement of currency out of the country over $10,000
* Keep records of any transaction over $3,000 (including the customer details)
* Open up these books and records to law enforcement essentially whenever they want, as long as they say the magic word ("terrorism")
Do any BTC exchanges operate within the US? I doubt it. Also, as a practical matter, enforcement is unlikely to go after domestic miners just because it doesn't make financial sense. However, they'll definitely start to chase the exchanges.
And, US laws can still reach these wholly-overseas exchanges. For example, they can require that any bank that DOES do business in the US shut down the correspondent accounts of any Foreign FI. Let's say Mt. Gox has accounts with DBS or OCBC (to name two prominent Singaporean banks). Well, guess what, those banks do business in the US and are subject to regulation there. Now, you can find banks that do no business in the US, but even they ultimately correspond or do bank-to-bank business with other, larger FIs and can be threatened with shut-off.
This (draft) rule-making is properly seen as setting the groundwork for the regulation and ultimate extirpation of virtual currencies. You may disagree, but it's obvious to me that people use bitcoin to avoid regulations, taxation, and government confiscation of assets (see, e.g., Cyprus). **They can't stop you from mining or exchanging it for goods and services, but they can make it much more difficult to "get it back out" and convert to USD or other fiat currency, and they probably intend to.**

Did you even read the post you're replying to?
Q: "Do you know who you're sending it to?"
A: "That's none of your business!"
To answer your question, banks have various reporting requirements. Among them are suspicious activity reports. You'd probably rather not have one of those filed on you/your accounts. Can they prevent you from taking it? Probably not, but it will make your life easier to make nice to some customer service rep who is just following a script and doesn't really give a shit anyways.

difficult for them to do when it's in bitcoins, though!

Anyone who does significant business in btc should have contractual provisions providing for mandatory, binding arbitration anyways. Opt out of the broken monetary and legal systems at the same time.
@_date: 2013-01-15 09:34:38
That is not correct. It's offshore accounts over 10k, and since bitcoins aren't a currency and MtGox isn't a bank, this doesn't qualify.

UniCredit is probably insolvent but since it is the largest bank in Italy, the EU will try to prop it up as long as possible

This is part of the premise of Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash and Diamond Age - territorial nation-states go the way of the dodo because of crypto-currency. It's a beautiful dream; I don't know that bitcoin is the one that'll get us there, but the improvements to the payment infrastructure (like that one ATM) are promising.

What's the deal with these cards? Do they contain btc in a cold wallet or are they linked to some account/service?

It sounds like you've never tried to do business in or with China. The entire financial system is designed to take money out of the hands of people and shovel it into the government and its preferred projects. There are stringent capital controls and financial repression is endemic. The amount of regulations and laws and approvals that are required to do anything is massive, which necessitates widespread bribery and corruption.
If the CCP could not force people to earn negative real returns on their money and use that to subsidize loss-making state-owned enterprises which provide employment and perks to a large proportion of the population, the government would immediately collapse.
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:43:35
Exactly right - they have some of the most restrictive capital controls in the world. That said, the fact that BitCoin is difficult for governments to control will enhance its popularity in direct proportion to financial repression, which is why I suspect it will become increasingly popular not only in China, but in places like Iran and Argentina.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:22:58
Not relevant. It appears that the law around stored value was designed to address circumvention by use of gift cards and prepaid phone cards and the like. This draft rule specifically says that virtual currencies are not those.
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:34:11


Nonetheless, I agree that the nature of cryptography makes enforcement problematic (and, as I said, uneconomic in the case of individuals with maybe a few hundred bucks).
