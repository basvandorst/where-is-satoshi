Understanding marketcap and total supply of coins... Always demand comes in play as well... Dnt know how high BtC will go though not a wizard... If you dont want to hold can always sell and get back in or into something else

Because BitCoin went away from Satoshi's plan... The reason why bitcoin cash is called real BitCoin is because its sticking to whitepaper... Bitcoin community thought they where smarter than the inventor of bitcoin.. Fcked some shit up than the community like wtf you guys doing just stick to the plan its works perfect... Omg now we have to create a new bitcoin because you guys fcked shit up and couldn't just follow the directions on the box... Bitcoin=cash digital gold = propaganda because they fcked it up and now you can't use it as cash

We will see if this holds up... 350B marketcap fee's are fine and transactions take minutes... 800B marketcap fee's are terrible and transactions take over a day

Is LN working atm?? Is bitcoin scaleable atm?? Did you read bitcoins whitepaper?? Is Bitcoin sticking to Satoshi's plan?? Why fix something that ain't broke?? Hope bitcoin gets their sht together before gets replaced by a product that is a copy of it before it decided to get fancy with the plans... Why is no one mad that bitcoin community fcked up Satoshi product??

What happens when we hit 1 trillion marketcap?? That 2 lane road is going to get backed up AGAIN... Is Lightning scaleable?? I'm sorry as someone that owns bitcoins I'm pissed that the bitcoin community did not increase blocks and went away from white paper... Go away from Satoshi's plan lets see how that plays out ..fckin retards always fck something up when they try and fix something that aint broke... Well guess what Bitcoin you obviously broke now thats why so many merchants dropped you when we had 800B marketcap with 1 day transactions... Talk all the shit on Roger ver but we all realise he's a fcking try hard!!! If you aint cheating you aint trying... IMO

This is a saying for idiot's... If you agree with Mark than you don't understand mathematics... If you're in debt and interest is 50% ... Bitcoin will still outperform that... This statement was told to first time investor's in stock market had nothing to do with bitcoin.... His point was if you make 10% best outcome in stock market but you had a car loan at 30% interest it would be better to pay off loan before investing... Because of the interest rate is higher than ROi
