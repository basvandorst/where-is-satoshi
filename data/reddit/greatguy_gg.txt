I was actually co-relating the constantly shrinking growth rate of with alienating content to newcomers. The subreddit dropped 5 ranks only in the month of August when the debate reached the boiling point. 
I was merely theorizing, neither lying nor altering data.

A news panel of people (seemingly) knowing what they're talking about. Impressing. 
The people that wrote the teleprompt transcript must have studied bitcoin.

Having been a copywriter myself, I find startup names to be very creative. Knowing that they rarely consult professionals when it comes to picking a name I'm often impressed by the names. 
I can't figure out the thought process of people saying they suck. Sure, there's a cliche bitcoin startups follow of including **bit** in the name. But in the end of the day, it can be appropriate depending on the target demographic. 
What the author belittles as a pun actually works the other way around. The fact that a syllable is a little overused doesn't make it less 'sexy' or 'witty' so it can be included to more names. Brand recognition is important too but having a name your target audience can easily memorise is also beneficial. 
Picking a distinctive name over a memorable name is never appropriate. If companies are trying to differentiate then the name is the least of their worries. The competition they face in terms of quality of service isn't going to be solved by having a unique name. 
Also misusing Elon Musk's quote hurts. 
TL;DR people saying names of bitcoin companies suck are very grumpy and know little about the subject

With the bitcoin foundation selling positions, why does Oliver still take pride into being part of it after trying to ridicule the whole operation by releasing 'insider information'? 
I see a lot of hypocrisy in what he does.

A single person could translate the video. With youtube's subtitle contribution feature that would be even easier since you can upload the video and have someone watch it and translate it even after you've publicized it.

It's greatly exaggerated. First of all, the exchange looking to kickstart this project doesn't have the funds or liquidity to support such a project. ~~They've only shown interest on bringing a big number of BTMs in the country (which is probably not even going to be close to 1k) but have shown zero infrastructure of being able to do so.~~ I also exaggerated.

Aren't miners some of the most valueable clients of exchanges, hardware manufacturers and payment processors? I know you're speaking hypothetically but that's very unlikely.

The growth is slowing down significantly as indicated by the stats, which is what I said.

Thank you for your work theymos. There's a respectful bunch of bitcoin users that fully appreciate your dedication.
I'm glad that you're still looking to maintain the meaningfulness of this community. 
has taken multiple hits lately and the only logical assumption is that it's due to its community's behaviour. Newcomers are alienated, the subreddits growth has slowed down significantly since it entered top 200 in February 2014. 
As [Reddit metrics]( indicates, the subreddit fell from rank 200 to 210 during 2015, and lost 4-5 ranks only during August with the block size debate being discussed on a daily basis. 
Fixing this is going to be hard, but among all the trolls and people that are never satisfied there's a group of bitcoin users that support you and your work theymos. If you decide on enforcing the rules more strictly this silent but reasonable minority will stand with you.

If you look at his [post history]( it's also gone from there.

The longest chain is never viewed as an altcoin. Historically, intentional forks were followed as they received consensus agreement. If a minority of users want to follow a specific fork, then of course they aren't going to perceive it as an altcoin.

There's no reason to make everything sound like a conspiracy. 
If anything, the latest events revealed that the companies/publishers/developers having their games featured there have an option to not accept certain means of payment. We shouldn't automatically assume that it's corporate pressure.

Old node statistics were inflated. Numbers in them were unrealistic.

How is what statistics indicate a lie?

Majority of the Chinese pools were voting for 8Mb before they switched to BIP100. Antpool and BW still put out blocks in support of 8Mb in fact. I don't see how BIP100 could realistically lead us to 32Mb blocks in the near future. The current use of bitcoin doesn't even indicate there's need for 8Mb. A 2Mb cap at start could probably let many of the current nodes survive for some time before being forced to upgrade or close down.

Good with words indeed, but abysmally bad at addressing points. 
1. Mental Institution(?) 
2. 19 years old to London, alone, yet you refuse to let her live with you. True love!
3. Convince her to advertise bitcoin only services for six months
4.   +  made her go homeless(?) Had to work a crappy job with ridiculous hours to make enough yet you break up because you didn't want her to live with you
What's more shocking is the reason you refused to help her with housing. You claim FTB is under covers because it hasn't even been properly organized yet, but you were willing to give up your love for this? 
And all this ends with the announcement of a fundraiser?

They were distributing the coins to people 'contributing' to their forum and blog. Mostly resulted into bad articles being published. 
Seems like the coin was removed from exchanges as well(?).

BIP101 is worse since it proposes 8Mb blocks. This would mean that any block after the the fork could be up to 8Mb in size. How's that better for node operators? Bandwidth needed per block could be going up and down all the time, block storage would require upgrades  more often than before, etc.

Sounds like character assassination though doesn't it? To think that he's naive one would have to disagree with his actions. Attempting to add basis to the opposing their views by trying to justify them only because of his age they're confirming the bias.

Crazy eh? This would mean that he was around 18 years old when contacting Satoshi and writing the first blockchain explorer. I realise some people will look down upon him solely because of the age but I admire what he was able to accomplish at such a young age.

How were those keys disclosed? Were the attackers purposefully letting out paper wallets filled with dust and with extremely weak passwords to attack the network (in a similar manner like the one now)?

Isn't this more effective with old, now inefficient machines if what you'd want to do is reduce J/Gh? 
Antminer S1 could be undervolted for an effcicinecy boost of ~40%. S2 was sold undervolted, people broke down on how to undervolt S3 and IIRC efficiency was up ~5%, S4's was ~3%. You get the idea. 
Do you think that a chip of 0.18J/Gh could have it's efficiency doubled by underclocking?

After the article was out, I think it's safe to assume that you received a lot of attention.

Μένεις Ελλάδα; Δεν νομίζω πως να καταφέρεις να βρεις τίποτα όσο είναι ακόμα κλειδωμένες μόνο για χρήση σε Ελληνικές επιχειρήσεις οι δικές μας. Το Bitboat είχε ένα [demo]( για p2p συναλλαγές αλλά δεν νομίζω πως άρχισε ποτέ να λειτουργεί.

Yes because there was a method to fill a day's blocks with less than 6 BTC revealed and no one is using it.
