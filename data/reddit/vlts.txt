Bread price expert here, it is the same. Bitcoins are becoming more valuable, it doesn't have to do with fiat currency crashing, otherwise you would notice the price of everything changing. Fiat currency is too backed up to crash suddenly, and it has a ton of trust behind it.

Bitcoins were just in the news, so it's not really surprising to see, though it is great that more people are learning about them.

If you try it out with a smaller amount, it works fine. The problem seems to be that the website takes a small percentage of all those that enter, and when you make a large bet relative to the other ones currently in the pot, that single bet takes the brunt of it. As (if) more people enter, the winnings will increase. For example, if only two person entered and bet 1 btc for each side, if person A is wrong, they lose everything (goes to the other person), but if they're right, they gets.95btc (the other person's side minus 5%, I assumed the rate was something like that). Even still, the website should've been smarter with its calculations, because this discourages betting.

There's no way that's real. OP dropped the "$100" line and later:




Definitely (hopefully) did not happen.
