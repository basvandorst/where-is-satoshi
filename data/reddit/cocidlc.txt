Will it be extremely rare by then, or will it be used by everyone?

Thanks. Do I have to redownload the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:12:20
It worked! Didn't have to synchronize anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:02:51
Can someone that has done this verify?
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:23:28
I was talking about bitcoin.org where you download the core wallet. But my question was answered. :)

I'm using Windows 10 64 bit.
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:20:20
So, what should I do to signal it?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:48:57
Bitcoin *is* the first cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:52:33
 This is what it shows. Does it have to say BIP 148 somewhere?
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:20:34
So, how do I install it without deleting the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:23:45
Yeah, already did, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:12:47
I am using 64 bit v0.14.2
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:34:18
I've decided that I'll just wait for it to sync. It'll take days though

So, how powerful does my computer have to be? How much space would running a node take? And is it heavy on PC resources? I just want to not lose them man.

I feel like the best decision is to not sell them. Because looking back in time, after Bitcoin prices fall, they tend to go significantly higher, and never go as low as they were before.

Should I make my own node with Bitcoin Core, or just put the coins in a hardware wallet like Trezor?
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:30:26
Yeah my CPU is crap, just a Pentium G3258. My average download speed is 100mbps and I'm running v.0.14.2
