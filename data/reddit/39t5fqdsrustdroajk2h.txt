i heard about this dude years ago, but the article states -"Erik Finman made rounds mid-2017 when he became a millionaire, thanks to his bitcoin investments and his online education company called Botangle which he later sold.

I swear to fucking god. How hard is it for jounos to just read the basics before writing articles. its fucking astounding to me.
Every article on this topic doesnt archknowledge the fact that energy TRANSPORTATION is the main issue. Not production.
You cant do a bitcoin comsumes x% and that might be a problem. It is not that simple, because you can move the miners to the energy source. A very good example is Iceland, where they have alot of miners because they have an abbundance geothermal energy there, and if they doesnt use it on something locally, its just wasted.
Its the absolute state of journalism today. Fuck trying to understand the subject, lets get some of those sweet global warming and bitcoin clicks.

I sincerely hope youre right, but there is major issues with stupidity and low attentionspans.
And as you can see, people like Andreas, is very rare. Few people are both experts, can communicate well and has the patience for stupidity.
I studied close to many journos and in my experience, a majority just dont really give a fuck about accuracy. They tell themselves - "If thats what the people want to hear, who am I to decide otherwise", which is true about choosing subject, but silly when defending leaving out important context like in this article.
Ive litteally never heard one of the journos I know, talk about how well researched their article were. They just keep mentioning "impact", which is code for clicks. Its really sad.
Personally, I think journos have a major blame-role in the political polarization going on in the west atm. 
Edit: Fun fact cherry on top of journo hate post - Journalism is the second most field, in terms of giving themselves awards. Right next to actors. To me, that says something even  though im not entirely sure what.

There is a dude who claimed to be Satoshi. I call him fake satoshi and not his name because he shouldnt have gotten any exposure at all. He went on BBC and provided cryptographic proof which turned out to be fake. When the fraud was exposed, he suddenly did a 180 and didnt want any recognition stating -"If people dont believe me, I dont care", which is pretty weak after going on TV to talk about it.
We will run out of btc in 2140. Leave that worry to your grandkids. 
Theres a lot of speculation regarding satoshi... One of the simplest and more popular explainations is that he was the now dead Hal Finney, who became ill around the time satoshi went dark. But nobody knows, so there really isnt a point in asking unless you wanna decide what satoshi-myth you like best.

@_date: 2018-01-22 00:33:30
Im not buying it. You dont know what youre talking about and when pressed on it your response is: "Theyre almost the same" and thats not true. 
I didnt want to say, because I dont really like appeals to authority when debating, but I did take econ 101 (not danish name though) as part of my studies, so maybe we were just taught different things.
Here fungibility is called "fungibilitet" and means: "each unit of a currency is interchangeable with one another". Example: 1 Krone is worth excatly the same as another Krone.
And opportunity cost is "offeromkostninger", which means: "The additional cost of not being able to invest in something else". Example: My investment in Apple makes 5% a year, but NVIDIA makes 10% a years, which results in a 5% loss in opportunity cost.
These two concepts are not similar at all. 
Im just gonna be straight. I think youre full of shit. You do appeals to authority and doesnt archknowledge when youre clearly misunderstand my points. It seems pretty pathetic tbh. 
If we were just taught different things at school, Im sorry for the harsh words and I hope you can forgive me, but you just seem disingenerous to me..

Historically thats what trying to execute on fantasies of utopia leads to. Love and compassion leads to destruction and malice when applied on leadership. 
The being with most potential for evil is the compassionate mother trying to protect her child because she hates the attacker with a passion. That will manifest in evil and twisted behaviour, justified by her compassion for her child. Like torture for example. He deserved it. He tried to harm my child.
A soldier will just neutralize the attacker. No emotion. Just logic. 
You need at society ruled by cold, emotionless logic. ruling by love and compassion leads to evil and malice.

thats not fungibility. Thats opportunity cost. Basic economic concept :) Google dictionary - "the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen."
My PC has 2 1070. They were fully paid for in about 3 month. That means the price-gouging-difference were paid for within 2 months if im being generous. But yea, if you consider that a looooooooong time, I will concede that point...

Explain your claim instead of just proclaiming it to be true and I might believe you. Especially since english is my second language, so im pretty open to being wrong about english words...
No, you just read what you wanted I guess. I did a general calculation based current stats. Thats not how it went for me ofc because current profits isnt the same as before. And also, I have free electricity up to a certain limit as part of my rent, so electricity cost is 0 in my case, but that seemed unreasonable to include in this general calculation.

"Investing means buying an asset that actually creates products, services or cashflow, such as a profitable business or a rentable piece of real estate, for an extended period of time. An investment is something that has intrinsic value – that is, it would be worth owning from a financial perspective, even if you could never sell it."  
So if you think theres some utility to bitcoin and cryptos, his argument doesnt apply to it.

Im not sure btc is a overall good thing long term. But when you get into good vs bad, you can apply many perspectives and get different answers. Some people think growth is good and some think its bad because were harming the planet. Some think were overpopulated as is and some would be against letting billions die.
The only really correct answer is that nobody really knows the future. A religious person might think cryptos is made by the devil to destroy humanity through greed. And that might turn out to be correct...
As an econ student, you should know that economics isnt a science. Its entirely based on human behaviour and how humans behave is always a giant x-factor.

You didnt understand then. You need cold, emotionless logic because without you make bad decisions leading to suffering. You cant make sound decisions if your jugdement is clouded by compassion, because compassion or love is irrational emotions. 
You just dont like to realize this fact, because you value compassion as a good thing. And it is. Just not when applied to leadership.
Like when a mother protects her child. She might do cruel things because of her emotions. Her compassion is what makes her care enough to be cruel. If you dont care, you have no reason to be cruel.
Try thinking about it for 2 seconds.. I realize arguing compassion and mother can be most cruel seems counterintuitive, but its the truth.
Just like greater love gives you greater potential for hate. Imagine having the  love of your life and then someone murders him/her. You might want to do things so terrible to that person, that you dont even realize yourself.
its Ying/Yang.

Excatly like I thought. You cant see straight because you got butthurt. Am I wrong to assume youre a chick?
I was just mocking him a bit while informing OP that Canada sold all their gold, which is something most people in the bitcoin community would agree is stupid. We generally dont like fiat, even with its better-than-gold liquidity. I wasnt trying to disparage anything through association and just because thats how you read it, doesnt make it true. Just your imagination, fueled by apparently raging emotions.

Thats being proven wrong as we speak it seems.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:20:28

If you really wanna play games, you should talk about funding lobbyist. I understand people are reluctant to playing those dirty games, but it might prove effective. 
I mean, if crypto is gonna get regulated to death or majorly slowed, its gonna be because of corrupt politicians, because we all know crypto is a good boi. Only takes money to play that game and the situation with Andreas getting millions without even asking for it and the pineapple fund, pretty much proves theres some whales around who doesnt mind spending a bit.
Edit: 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:38:03
Yes its a silly argument. 
CP my other post: people making this argument doesnt understand energy. We dont really have a production issue, but a transportation issue. We could power the entire planet many, many times by solar in sahara desert, but the problem is you cant transport that energy to where it is used.
Bitcoin doesnt have that problem since you can move the miners next to energy production. There are miners in Iceland who use geothermal energy to mine. If they didnt, that energy would be totally wasted. Now its atleast helping secure a network with some value and utility.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:17:50

I know americans really cant understand the difference between a sense of community and our "social kontrakt". It has nothing to do with individualism. It has nothing to do with helping people out on the street.
We are a people. That means having a shared history based on both blood and soil. Americans never, ever, ever get this. You cant be like us because your history is shallow, full of internal conflict and mainly based on ideals and soil. You are countrymen and we are a people because of this difference. Even the racial tension in your lovely country underlines this wonderfully.
You can do other, arguably better, things, like go to the moon or conquer the world both militarily and culturally.
But you can never instate our "social kontrakt" politically. You have to be a people first. maybe in a few centuries, but youre looking polarized as ever.

No thats not what im saying. 
you have this idea that people have money. They dont. Normal people have their value in property and maybe some stocks. Their fiat, they get from salaries and spend it all, some of it on property and stocks. Normal people also have alot of debt because thats how they got their property. 
If crypto took over, their debt would lose value. Thats a win. Their property would stay the same. And they would just start getting their salaries in btc and again thats not really making them poorer. So, for normal people, they would win since their debt is wiped and the rest stays the same. Thats good not bad. At least for the people who dont hold the debts. Like banks.
Its like when the internet took over. Normal people will benefit. The only losers are the ones getting replaced, like blockbuster n shiat.

You misunderstood my point if you think anywhere in there I agree socialized healthcare is a good idea, feasable, or wouldnt go down in flames in NY. Maybe in a rural state at the most, because here, the problems are in the cities. 
Here is what americans can never understand. We have a very strong "social kontrakt". It really isnt a political concept. It is shared feeling of community that comes from our millenia old history. We have the world oldest monarkies and even discovered Amerika centuries before your that guy you give credit. 
Our socialized systems is only feasible because we care of eachother as a people. You dont. Youre just countrymen. They work because our countries are still tribes in some sense. There are two places socialized healthcare is even working decently. Here and in Japan. This is what we and Japan has in common. We dont fight eachother in the streets (unless soccer, but thats just sport) and we dont have ill wishes towards our leaders even though we didnt vote that way.
And you might think the "caring" has relevance to establishing these systems. It doesnt. It matter because people here care enough about each other to NOT OVERUSE THEM. Can you really say the same about New Yorkers?

people making this argument doesnt understand energy. We dont really have a production issue, but a transportation issue. We could power the entire planet many, many times by solar in sahara desert, but the problem is you cant transport that energy to where it is used. 
Bitcoin doesnt have that problem since you can move the miners next to energy production. There are miners in Iceland who use geothermal energy to mine. If they didnt, that energy would be totally wasted. Now its atleast helping secure a network with some value and utility. 
Look at the guy who wrote the article. Thats the kind of silly dude who writes about subjects without even trying to understand the basics.

Your friend could do like I do and buy the cards and then earn the money back by mining. GPU mining has allowed me to buy a much juicier PC than I would have.
If the bottom falls out, the mining cards will be way cheaper than before, so in either scenario, your friend is only losing out because of himself.

What you do is this: Stop looking at cryptos as a get rich quick scheme. Only invest in coinz you have researched, like and are willing to hold for 1-5 years. Trade your shitcoinz for some coinz that fit that criteria. 
If you dont understand crypto well enough to do research, just buy bitcoin and hold. Im not sure how smart or informed you are on cryptos, but you shouldnt trade it, if you dont understand the tech since youre open to being scammed.

Lol. Im actually im from Scandinavia. We have universal, free healthcare. Its shit except people with no money can get some treatment. If you have a serious illness and money to get treated, nobody here would use public hospitals.
Im not really trying to trash it, since Id prefer to keep it actually. Its just false to say that it works pretty well. If I broke my arm tomorrow, I would go to a private hospital, since last time I broke my wrists, I had to sit there and wait 9 hours. Sitting in a DMV like setting, only with sick and hurt people.
Also, our welfare-systems are breaking and getting cut all the time. Our societies (Norway, Denmark, Sweden) are rich and well off because the people here has good work ethic, unlike southern europe where they collectively nap, wasting 25% of their work day. And because were effective unlike eastern europe where their feeling of efficiency got wiped away by communism teaching their earlier generations "They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work".
We then used that wealth to buy ourselves luxuries like education, healthcare ect. 
When a household get rich enough to buy a dishwasher, its not a waste because its useful because it safes the breadwinners time to earn more money. Its not what made the household rich to begin with, and it gets less useful if they real source of wealth diminishes because the time saved is less valuable.
Our "socialized" political structures was bought and paid for by centuries of succes (and failures). Foreigners should really stop using us as an example.

I already included that in my possible scenarios in earlier post. Ofc. theres some risks involved, but if it crashes, gamers can now get their gpus way cheaper than before because of miner flooding, so thats a win for gamers. Its totally a legitimate concern.
The market could also stay the same or go up... Youre assuming worst case scenario, which is completelyfair, but its only a risk. 
Maybe my perspective is too biased, but I consider myself both a miner and a gamer. Mining has allowed me to join the "PC-masterrace" club, which I couldnt before because of financial barriers and now these people are saying im an asshole because they didnt do the same thing, even though there was no barrierers. 
I can understand it sucks for people who just want a new GPU for gaming, but that doesnt make their complaints legitmate. It just seems petty and shortsighted imo. 
Again, maybe im too biased, but I feel like I belong to both groups, which I think gives me a balanced perspective.

Im not mad..Im just bringing a bit of heat to make the discussion fun.
debt based in the sense that every dollar in existence, was only created because it was originally loaned out. Thats means for every dollar, theres are corresponding dept somewhere else.
Thats not the case with cryptos. 21 million btc exists (will max exist). Nobody owes those crypto to anybody for the creation. 
Sure the Ms are a big pile, like I said. But the corresponding debt is even bigger. Heres an example: If crypto took over, what would happen to US national debt? Thats like 20 trillion. It would lose value. 
Bitcoin is divisible. If a company doesnt have btc to pay their employee, thats the same as a company now that doesnt have enough dollars. Thats also occuring right now for entire nations. See Zimbamwe for example.

The entire fiat system is debt-based. You imagine theres some big pile of cash going worthless somewhere. Thats true, but a WAAAAAY bigger pile of debt is also becoming worthless.

It seems like you dont understand how mining works since you think there might be an issue. I dont want to explain mining to you. Check out some videos.
Because of the incentives involved, you will see mining becoming based around areas with more electricity than can be used locally. Like my example with Iceland. 
There is zero chance there will be any climate related issue coming from crypto-mining and anybody who understands energy and mining knows this.

Youre right on the second part. I wrongly assumed normal people do economic planning. Like I can spend more this month, if it will get paid back in the future. Either by savings or credit. Youre totally right on that part. If people cant do that, they probably cant learn mining, and should keep playing videogames. Those people have legitimate grievances.

Lets do a little calculation, so you dont need to trust me on the rig part. Right now 1 1070 earn you about $3 each day at $0,3kWh (which is expensive). Thats $90 a month * 3 months = $270. 1070 costs $449.
Now thats not fully paid off, but my calculation was conservatively done in regards to electrical costs and the market just had a 20-30% plummet. 
So even with conservative calculations you would have paid off 60% of the cost, which is more than price gouging anyways.

There hasnt been any major world changing use-cases (except decentralized money imo), but there has been many, many smaller use cases. Just look at crypto-kitties or SatoshiDice back when bitcoin was young.
Blockchains can certainly also be used as a version of PayPal, being proven by dark markets evolving around them.
Its ridiculous to claim there hasnt been use cases for blockchains yet, unless there strict criteria on the definion.
This article picks big areas of innovation and argues because blockchains hasnt disrupted any of them in any major way yet, theyre useless. 
Personally, I dont see why not having succeeded yet have to mean to succeeding in the future. Esepcially when considering the scope of what bitcoin is trying to achieve.

Agreed on the segwit part. And their bs excuse with customers not requesting it. But still, ofc they arent stellar or anything. They have done alot to make btc easy for newbs. And last time price went nutz, it was on the back of mt. gox. Id prefer CB to that this time around. 
I dont like bch, but people here should be promoting the fact that if you sell bch, btg and all the other fork-coins, you create a snowball effect. We just need ppl doing that, then only good forks will stand a chance. We dont need to scream like babies, trying to blacklist companies who dares making money by trading those forked coinz.

This chart has applied to bitcoin perfectly 4 times this year alone. If you allow me to choose timeframes freely, I can make that chart match many, many times without a "return to normal" period after. Look at august for example.

Im defending them because I think people are overreacting. 
I just dont think Coinbase has done anything wrong, expect there could be some insider-stuff with the timing of pump. Also, I want as many exchanges to trade bch as possible because that means ppl can dump bch for btc when they realize holding btc gives you a snowball effect of free fork-coinz.
I think its harmful to attack coinbase, based on speculation, like this community has because they are valuable infrastructure to btc, whether ppl like it or not, and I dont want to see us handing over our infrastructure to bch-ppl.

Things are more black/white than banks = bad. Having a worldview like that isnt very constructive. 
Example: Two consumer banks wanna settle txs between them. Back in the gool ol days, they used a "settlement bank", but that got wiped out because the blockchain Wave made them obsolete. The immediate benefit goes to the two consumer banks and the "banksters" controlling Wave, but its still a win because 1 bank was wiped out by a blockchain. 1 step at the time.

You have good points as well. 
1st point of disagreement: Bitcoin cant die from a massive selloff. My argument: In theory you are completely right. A 1000x price-decrease, assuming hashrate follows, without EDA would kill the network since it would take way to long for normal adjustment. 
In practice, if a major selloff happened, miners shuts off, blocks become slower and fewer tx are processed. That means people cant sell, slowing down the selloff and buying the network time for a readjustment.
If the selloff is coordinated or something like that, I could see it as a possibility, but also remember, that not all miners are completely profit-driven. We saw that doing the first "cashening". Alot of miners didnt switch chains even though it became more profitable to mine bch. 
We have a bit of disagreement on eth, but I really dont know the details well enough to be calling it unsecure or centralized, but what I do know is that you arent supposed to be able to roll the chain back. I can understand emergency situations, but its still doesnt have btcs spotless record in that regard. And Vitalik is a VERY central figure compared to anything btc has. Actual question: If Vitalik (for unknown reason) wanted to destroy eth. Lets say he did an eth-BIP with an upgrade which destroys the network, while saying its just optimizations. Would that be implemented you think? 
Back to scaling of btc: Its not that im opposed to a blocksize-increase. Gun to my head, its probably gonna happen at some point. Im just conservative about it. I dont want to rush a non-reversable decision. And I want is to explore as many possibilities as possible, make all the other optimizations and these kind of things.
What I will never do, is listen to people ,who 1 year ago, thought bitcoin was a company, screaming about bitcoin being unusable because they had to pay a big fee when were right in the middle of a panic/hype-period.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:39:37
I know it sux watching others get rich. Its never fun to sit on the bench, but projecting envy on strangers online is just pathetic.

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:09
Listen, we are going through a high-interest period. Much demand because of it. It cant be helped atm. but eventually it will smooth back out when the hype goes down. 
Then there will be a some time passing with the network being bloated and btc not really being usable to buy coffee ect. because of fees. then there will be scaling improvements and another hype cycle begin, and we learn bitcoin second biggest weakness. last time it was the exchange infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:44:50
Ty for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:52:49

@_date: 2017-12-24 22:59:01
Things arent that black/white. In 2013, the hype died and the network didnt die as well. That rise and fall was even quicker in terms of price.
Ethereum already have issues with scaling just cause of crypto-kittens. And Ethereum has actually ROLLED THEIR CHAIN BACK. 
How can you even argue ethereum is decentralized when a central entity already did a major operational change?
But. Lets pretend what you wrote is 100% accurate. Worst case scenario is just an EDA. Thats a WAAAAAY smaller problem than if centralization leads to chineese miners forming a cartel and (persuaded by their gov.) not confirming txs from blacklisted individuals.
My point: Its not that black/white. Its about balance between decentralization and utility. On-chain scaling sacrifices 1 for the other. I dont really see a problem with increasing the blocksize, but  NOT AS A RUSHED DECISION IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRICE-PANIC.
We dont need retarded hyperbolic rhetoric like: "bitcoin is going to die" and we dont need any more FUD. 
You know about SW2X right? The rushed almost-fork which had a major bug in it. If we had upgraded blocksize then, there would have been big problems.

@_date: 2017-12-25 03:57:10
fair enough. Its not incorrect in that it describes bubbles that pop and end "in the mean". What it describes is human psychology when it comes to investing. 
The problem is that some bubbles dont return to the mean (like my example illustrated or growth of big companies). You cant use memechart to predict whether we will actually return to the mean.
It is very easily applied afterward (making it lazy), but doesnt have any predictive power, so when used in a predictive context, its pretty silly.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:17:46
Listen. Without security, nothing else matters. BitGold (szabos company, not btg) scaled just fine. There never was a problem with tx fees and it couldve handled 1000´s of tx/s. Why didnt BitGold revolutionize money and finance? Because it was centralized. It got regulated up the ass and eventually shut down.
When you increase on-chain scaling (raising the blocksize), you trade decentralization for utility (scaling). 
Fees are a problem and they are holding bitcoin back right now. But, that doesnt mean we should sacrifice our decentralization for utility. Especially since we already have some centralization problems already.
So let me say it again. Without decentralization and security, everything else about bitcoin DOES NOT MATTER because it will be regulated and shut down.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:04:49

@_date: 2017-12-16 09:16:24
Im not a technical so im gonna instead explain non-technical thats better with btc. It is, at least for the forseeable future, the main bitcoin. that means there are forks being done on it for brand or other reasons. Lets say u have 1 btc and bch forks, u sell ur 1 bch for 0,1 btc. You now have 1,1 btc. now btg forks and u get 1.1btg and u sell get more btc. Who knows how many forks will be done on the original giving smart ppl interests on their btc. All of this supposed bitcoin doesnt get dethroned by 1 of the forks ofc. but that doesnt look likely right now.

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:49:28
And to the people worried about fees: Yes it is a problem, but right now were in a hype period. When the hype settles, fees will go down as well. 
This may prove to be a good thing in the end. Last bubble popped because of bad exchange infrastructure. It got way better this time. If this bubble pops because of fees and scalability, next time it will get better.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:01:28

NOBODY thinks our current fees isnt a problem. But there are alot of people like me, luckily, who realized that were right now in a hype period. Doing emergency HFs based on fear and panic will only bring more shit. Just look at SegWit2X. Major bugs. If we did increased blocksize then, bitcoin would have crashed, showing further the need for time and competence when upgrade a project worth 250 BILLION.
Tx/s and fees are a problem. Everybody agrees. But Im not willing to let anyone risk the entire network because you cant transact doing A GOODAMN HYPE PERIOD.

I would prefer alt coins being created like btg as opposed to eth. that means btc-hodlers get free coins from letting another alt use the bitcoin brand like bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, super bitcoin and probably more to come.

I kinda agree, but its hard to define so firmly, as to calling it a scam. I mean, you can do legitimate contengious HFs. Its just that BCH doesnt have any developers and they talk alot about "satoshi original vision", which is kinda cultish.
But heres what you do about these fork-coins. You sell them for btc. Ive gotten about 15% off my bch adn then 2,5% off that 115% of my btc because of bitcoin gold. Looking forward to bitcoin diamond and the others.

What has CB really done? They allow trading of one of the more popular alts. They already supported LTC and ETH. I dont see the big deal. 
I get there are some suspect timing involved, but couldnt that just be bch-ppl timing after CB and not collusion?
I dont think its a fair reaction coming out of this community for what theyve done. And I think people here should focus on promoting another narrative than "fuck CB and Fuck Ver".
Id rather see this narrative amplified, since its better and more understandable than technical blockchain-scaling debate:
Btc and bch is completely different in 1 way. Holding btc grants you free fork-coinz. If you had 1 btc when bch was forked, sold it for 0,1, you now have gained 10% btc. 
Then comes bitcoin gold. You sell btg for 0,025 btc, but thats off of 1,1btc, 110% of initial investment. Then comes bitcoin diamond....
Also, bch doesnt have any developers for now. But if people understood they could exponentially increase their btc holdings by selling forks, scammy forks in the future wouldnt be a problem.

I agree on the breaking stuff part. At least if its privately owned stuff. 
Blocking roads and gasstations seems like pretty normal strike/protest behavior as long as ambulances can get through.
Being a nuisance is the point of striking so that seems fine. 
There were some protests/riots here in Denmark some years ago, which I thought were stupid, but it wasnt because of the riots alone, but because I didnt think their grievances were legitimate.
It seems like you think the vestpeople have legitimate grievances, so I wonder why you arent pointing your finger at Macaroni and his GILF, for creating such a response instead of vestpeople for overreacting?

A strike of trashpeople is a nuisance as well to regular people. It doesnt help any1, like you say about the vestpeople. Thats the point. Its a way to get heard.
Im not sure how legitimate their grievances is, or/if they are overreacting, since I havent looked into it that much.
But youre just describing how a normal strike works and thats generally accepted as a legitimate form of protest.
So, do you either; dislike strikes? or think the vestpeople are stepping out of bounds of what you normally consider a strike? If the last is right, how so?
Also: "Europe" isnt really an entity to be used for comparison, since the nordic countries (except Sweden) are keeping the average good, while you southern countries keep having issues on most fronts.

You also didnt formulate a real argument. I mean, unequal wealth distribution isnt bad on its own. If you work twice as many hours as me at the same job, you should get more. 
Businesses can also be a single guy making high quality wooden tables. They come in many different shapes and sizes. I agree that big coorporations shouldnt have too much power over populations, but that not businesses as a concept.

The Nobel prize for economics is in reality "Sveriges Riksbanks pris i økonomisk videnskab til Alfred Nobels minde" or translated to something like "Swedish Central banks prize for economic science in honor of the memory of Alfred Nobel".

@_date: 2018-10-30 10:29:23
People should understand why the climate change argument is silly. 
Climate change ect. is not the result of a problem with producing energy. It is caused by mankinds inability to transport energy efficiently in electrical form. We could easily power the entire world with renewables if we, for example, could transport geothermal electrical energy produced in Iceland to the rest of the world where it would be used, which is primarily cities around the world.
We cant move the cities to solve this problem, but you know what is totally movable? Mining hardware. 
This means that bitcoins "dirty" energy consumption does not scale linearly with the rest of mankinds.
I havent looked at the underlying study these articles are based on, but Im betting they used linear scaling in their model(s). But still, its pretty much impossible to predict which % of clean energy will be used on bitcoins network, even if you knew for certain for the rest of society. Which they also dont. They make models and models have assumption which may and or may not be wrong.
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:54:04

Again, your question is unbelievably stupid, but here is the answer: The state just programs the cryptocurrency to fits the ideal of the state. Thats it. Look at Petro for example. Or the Universal Basic Income crypto as another example.

No central player has control. Everyone has access.

Theyre already doing that in normal databases.

If it just works for people to store their wealth, as youre describing, then its working fine to me. It doesnt have to be perfect fot all things to be a good investment.
that being said, if you wanna see where bitcoin is used as a currency right now, go check out the darknet markets. You can speculate about the future ect as much as you want, but the fact is bitcoin is already a working currency in an eviroment where it naturally grew because it was the best alternative available.

Its very fascinating. 
My personal answer right now, (Im not extremely set on this opinion, but I do think its better than what my country has now) is to modify what voting-rights means. When every citizen becomes an adult, their "balance" is zero. When you receive welfare ect. that subtracts from that balance and the taxes you pay add to that balance. If youre in the negative, you cant vote.
People dont like this, because they dont want to take other people rights to vote away, but thats really not the case, since welfare is optional. Everyone has the right to vote, but some will prefer to receive welfare over voting.
And yea, some handicapped people ect. dont really have a choice, but thats details and details should be handled on a detail level.
makes sense?

Thats not my point at all. You can cover "the technology" both more negatively and more positively. Its not like Ellen did an indepth objective explaination of how the tech works.
The media has been reporting overwhelmingly negatively on bitcoin for the last couple of years, since it became relevant enough to cover at all.
All of a sudden, they switched to a generally positive coverage, with Ellen being an example.
My comment is not about why the media is covering bitcoin in general. It is about the shift from negative to positive, which has been a very clear and stark shift right around the time we dipped.
Maybe youre new to bitcoin, so the shift isnt that clear to you?

I just think people should get credit when they do stuff right, because if they dont, they dont really have an incentive to improve.
We have different political opinions, so most of your argument of why theyre bad arent really doing it for me tbh. but I dont wanna discuss politics since it always devolves because people have a "team" mentality about it.

In my fictional example there isnt a possibility of slippery slope.
And there doesnt have to be a slippery slope possibility in reality so if we can increase scaling by 10000000x by sacrificing 5% decentralization, for example, that seems like a pretty good tradeoff imo.
But if ppl stomp their feet because of ideological reasoning, like assuming there have to be slippery slopes involved, that hurts bitcoin imo.

You still need scaling to achieve this effectively.
Lets say venezuelan ppl goes full monetary revolution, bitcoin isnt able to facilitate that atm. 
Most of us would be fine sacrificing 1% decentralization for 100000x scaling, so "maintaining the highest degree of decentralization possible." isnt really a thing unless you ignore the possible benefits of a tradeoff. 
Sure we want as much decentralization as possible if it doesnt cost anything, but thats just not reality.

A coke epidemic would also seem pretty likely if it were allowed to be advertised and was recommended by doctors.
How come american doctors are so susceptible to this sort of marketing? Im having a hard time believing its simple greed/corruption.

Im not from the US, so I might be ignorant on this issue, but sometimes I watch clips from your TV channel. When I do, I always see commercials for pharma drugs. To me, that seems to be the root of the issue. The commercialization of "medicine".

Calling them sexist and racist on reddit wont achieve anything either. so...
But they are not going to change into a better party if people are discounting their good actions by saying they will suck no matter what. 
Again, it seems to me that youre emotionally invested in disliking them, making it hard for you to praise them for a genuinly good speech. Even Hitler wasnt all bad. Nobody is.

Wierd discussion. You can be a french jew right so are you not both correct?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:30:36
Youre arguing against an example meant to illustrate a point. Why dont you argue against the point? The point being: Some tradeoffs sacrificing some decentralization might be worth it.
I litterally wrote that it was a fictional example so ofc. I dont think it was realistic.
And I do agree that without being decentralized bitcoin doesnt make sense. I just think saying "no compromise no matter what" is stupid and ideologically driven.

Idc about british politics. Both Corbyn and May seems sucky imo. 
BUUUUT ... Atleast UKIP is speaking up on this issue, which I think is a very important issue. Maybe theyre hypocrites, but its better than not being a hypocrite by being purely bad and silent. Why not commend UKIP by doing good for a change even if you dont like them?

If I were a UK citizen, I would be pro-brexit, so thats a plus imo.
You dont need scientific studies to make statements of truth, so thats not a rebuttal either.

Sad story with this guy. He was overall great and very good at explaining btc in unique  ways. He made 1 video about the big fork crisis that people didnt like, and got sooooo much shit for it. 
Last video he made. Very sad ppl in this space cant chill out more.
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:06:42
The last price spike was 2013 so compare 2017 to that and u can see less volatility.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:28:54
If you zoom out and put the chart on log, so you can see relative changes its pretty clear.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:17:03
Where did that come from? But it depends on which white people. We have enough eastern europeans as is. And germans + swedes arent very popular by default.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:31:09
It is. Just go look at the chart. It also makes sense since its getting bigger so it takes more to move it up and down.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:13:57
Irish people are very fun, so wouldnt mind a bit of those. Alot of people wanna come here anyways so I dont think bitcoin shopping makes a big difference.  I mean, were one of the top countries to live in, in terms of living standards, crime/decency and beauty.
@_date: 2018-12-30 20:14:01
I dont expect cryptos to become the standard currency in the foreseeable future because its too new and volatile ect. but it is getting less volatile over time. Long term. 
Anyway, I see bitcoin improving on many issues and maybe it will be equal or better than dollars on the volatility front in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:36:20
Its true. The price is still very volatile, but less than earlier. So its becoming less volatile.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:35:51
Its so unnuanced that its kinda nonsense. Like people who are "anti-war" or "pro good health".
@_date: 2018-12-26 12:03:41
Almost as bad as orange man. Resist.
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:45:15
Bitcoin is getting less volatile, easier to use and more accepted as  payment, so it is improving on the issues u point to.
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:10:17
No, Im good. But I very rarely see any sort of offensive strategies being talked about by people complaining about fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:45:24
I dont see how thats a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:37:21
Isnt it obvious? The spikes has become smaller than they were earlier. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:08:19
No less volatile than earlier. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:02:29
Ye, that was my point. First guy says american, second guy corrects him by saying french and third guy say jewish not as an correction, but instead as an addition. 
Jewish isnt just religious though. Its like a wierd mix of heritage and religion, but that neither here nor there.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:38:29
And up alot 3 years ago. It historically has grown in giant spikes and this time is just the same. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:15:56
No, I meant: why did u write that? I dont see the relation?
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:38:03
Anything that broad "holds some truth". If I were to sell you something, Id say it has a clean design and you would find some truth in that.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:34:32
Business is generally mutually beneficial imo. Rich people abusing poor people is called fraud, scam, predatory ect. Poor people fighting back can be called retribution, revenge, justice, karma, populism, greed ect. Its possible to find truths in all of these and many more.
I get it. You find some meaning in it, but its mostly just word games, and word games are nonsense. And characterized by depending on high amounts of interpretation.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:29:12
Tbh. If people truly didnt give a shit, they could max out their credit, buy crypto, cold storage, then default on the loans.
Its probably illegal n shiet, but a true assault on the current monetary system would take some sort of form like that.
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:18:34
Btc rises, falls and stabilizes in waves. So you have to compare each wave to eachother and you will see these waves become smaller = bitcoin less volatile.
