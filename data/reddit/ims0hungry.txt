corn on the theta?

This is what happens when people with very little to no trading exp. get in on things.

Do they open the auction at the value on the date seized or the realized value on the day of the auction?

They made the decision for him to come out, instead of him making it himself. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:17:38
Invoice links the wallet to his name. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:44:03
Mine took 2 days. Second one took 5 minutes. wtf lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:43:04
Yes, I keep 6 months liquid in a high-yield savings account, and have 401k, IRA, etc. BTC is not my only vehicle.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:52:30
why is this?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:02:35
You can have an order in that will only execute if a certain price is met. Either buy or sell. So you can set a limit order to sell 10 BTC @ $20k, and it wont happen until BTC hits $20k. Or you can put a limit order to buy 10 BTC @ $11k. 
I stagger them so I have various orders on the books for different prices, 2 BTC @ $15k, $14k, $13k, ..., $10k. This lets me get in on the dip automatically. There are different options with limit orders so read up [here]( for some more understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:37:29
That is why you stagger limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:14:10
Yes, dollar cost averaging. If they were asking me about limits I didn't want to go too deep and get into that with them yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:34:34
They are only a billionaire if they convert it, and doing so would drop the value.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:26:22
Yup all the people who bought it in on the hype and have weak hands want to get out without losing skin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:37:24
OP, please heed the warning and do this on a clean, offline pc!

Software wasn't released until Jan 3rd 2009. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:45:17
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:32:19
He dun goofed. My GF is a lawyer and laughed at how dumb a move this was. They will claw back those funds unless he somehow used an anonymous on ramp, but even then judges are not dumb and will pierce whatever veil they need to. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:16
So 8ve been trying to make a paper wallet as a Xmas gift but every damn time I print it, it's too big for A4 paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:55:46
When you say 'so closely' do you mean that a lot of people constantly check it or there is software running to watch it autonomously?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:43:08
That's nothing. There's some big players in the game that move millions at a clock of a button. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:52:51
They already have more money than they need. They were wealthy before the Facebook settlement.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:20:44
Making a document that long is a nightmare in MS word, especially one with graphics. LaTeX is a typesetting language that makes a job like that a stroll in the park. Changing one area of a finished part in a word document will mess with everything after it. LaTeX uses code to only affect change to the area you change, thats it. There's a reason it's the defacto way to write a Thesis at many Universities, or scientific papers, mathematics papers, and some coding algorithm papers as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:48:42
Can you elaborate on how to do that and which hardware wallet you recommend? I have a few coins sitting in coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:56:56
Too much power in one person would put the largest of targets on his back...
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:33:24
He was tipped mBTC for helping. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:45:16
What did you use to make the paper wallets? I'm planning to do the same and give some family members some coin
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:50:03
You should accept BTC as payment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:58
The bitcoin are all probably in a trust for his family vesting after a certain period of time. Also, Szabo had a "mid-life" career change and became a lawyer. It all adds up.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:36:11
Done right its like taking candy from a baby. I'm creeping up on making more money than my salary soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:41
Not when her lawyers go through a discovery period and claw-back funds. Unless he used an anonymous on-boarding method, he is fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:21:25
Pretty smart. It's a layer of obfuscation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:47
I answered his question. It isn't like I was screaming for all to hear. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:29:43
Did you use LaTeX?

You could track the coin through the blockchain until it makes an exit.

I religiously put 5% of each pay period into BTC. which comes to ~$1k a month.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:26:58
So will archive.io 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:12
Not true, I had it verified and funded within 15 minutes and bought some coin, then pulled it off the exchange and into cold storage for maximum HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:36:57
Yup, you're not making it out at that point. No one is. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:02:45
Check my reply above. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:50:56
Um...if he spent that much BTC back then on pizza, I can guarantee you that he is doing just FINE today lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:20:43
Learn machine code.

There is a great Netflix documentary about it too. They kind of state the same towards the end. 
Banking on Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:48
No, I guess what I was trying to imply is that the writer is confusing the release of Bitcoin to the world with it's invention. In reality the idea behind Bitcoin go way back to the 90's with Hashcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:57:01
Shouldn't surprise you as botting was one of his income sources. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:36:12
So very true. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:39:48
Jamie is so anti-bitcoin that it is almost taboo to talk about it at work.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:48:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:41:49
When you break my salary down to monthly payments its near that, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:15:36
Believe in the philosophy of Bitcoin? Lol, no, that would be them betting against themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:21:59
Use Calibre to change it yourself. (not being snark, just letting you know) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:53:52
Exactly, he is just silent about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:22:07
There are EMP hardened electronics.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:44:58
The same thing happens to app developers. The kid who made flappy bird was getting death threats and extorted. He was making $50,000 a DAY in a country where $150/month is the average income. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:47:22
IDK, I'm well above 25 BTC

How you think we get Merino wool?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:47:23
They own gemini right?
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:52:08
Almost all the people who winter over are scientist. Not sure if I'll have the get advice as my participation was as tangential support and not directly related. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:52:50
Nope. When you spend a whole winter with the same 300 people, standards get dropped real quick. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:45:01
They have a pretty nice setup. Direct sat links in some cases. TBH they are too busy fucking to worry about Bitcoin. 
source: used to fly resupplies to them. Took tons of condoms every time. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:42:17
anywhere to keep an eye out for them? I am looking to upgrade from my 670 so I might as well future proof with the latest and greatest. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:11:33
Plus $5000.
