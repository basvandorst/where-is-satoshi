Maybe it should take into account the relative (percentage) deviation from the rolling average on the same day a year ago to account for seasonal or predictable special events.
Something like 2 * (rolling average a year ago/average size last year) * (rolling average)

He did mention in the article that the algorithms seem to scale linearly with the transaction size and he implied that 200mb was feasible. That would give 600tps which seems pretty good.

You have to lock it in the channel as long as you want to use it on LN but you can always take it out again whenever you want by closing the channel (but you have to pay a transaction fee on the blockchain to do that).

If your assets outweigh your debt (liabilities) you are okay. Basically as long as you are being productive with the debt and producing more value with it than the liability of having to pay it off then you are good. Problems occur when that doesn't pan out and your actual assets aren't what you thought they were.

I was hoping for a video explaining segwit and lightning networks but I got a passive aggressive insult to someone actually trying to be helpful. Thanks.

They manage routing payments through the lightning network. You start a node and create a channel to another node (it's a Bitcoin transaction to create a channel, so you pay a once off fee there), then you can send and receive payments to or from any other node on the network with zero (or tiny) transaction fees

But if we all referred to them as Nancy then that would be their name so we would be correct...

If you want a centralised system, why use a blockchain? Seems like any log based database could work.
