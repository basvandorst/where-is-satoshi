great interview, but keep the camera on the lady next time
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:23:01
1. Restore faith and bring allot of money into the market that people already givin up on.
2. Make people sell huge ammounts of BTC and get the hell out of here.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:04:10
lol, after that 1 win.
Lose          and that at 50% lol
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:54:06
If they do its not just coins, its fiat and trust in bitcoin also..
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:53:14
hey looks like i won, but i dont get it... how can i see my bet on the website?
i did enter my bitcoin adress on the site but it shows nothing
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:54:12
shouldnt need love jet, should keep trying and advertising if u REALLY believe in your idea (that i think is quite good but we are still in a very early fase with bitcoin).
keep ya head up
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:02:19
True but to many keep it on exchanges permanent, wake up call... Dont! 
In your wallet its pretty save, atleast if u secure it! 
There arent so many wallets that get robbed, not more than in normal life...

I live in the Netherlands but just dont have that kind of money to "just" spend on a conference:(
Its like 1/4 of my entire bitcoin holdings atm lol
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:56:18
Jbssm, dont forget its your money not theirs.
To many services in bitcoin are beiing run by people who have no clue what they are doing. Time will wipe them out
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:21:07
People are still trading on BTC-e, look at bitcoinwisdom
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:08:48
What do u think happens on the stock market? its all a matter of "ask and bid".
Nothing more nothing less
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:51:57
Every innovation has its setbacks, and every innovation has its winners and losers... In the end the problem will be resolved.
And dont forget...99.9% of the people That Lose money(Btc) leave their currencys at a provider and not in their wallet!
U dont give your money to the store owner around the corner do you? You keep it in your wallet until u need/want something.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:38:56
Its fake, Photoshop 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:18:03
Yes very true, but a MTgox story i dont see happening anytime soon again.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:05:31
same problem here
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:23:59
Great idea, if its build by someone who can be trusted i would buy 1 litecoin worth of those coins.
But first find someone who wants to do it without profit for himself and who can be trusted!
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:11:46
There is no flaw in bitcoin, thats not what i mean with ahead of time. The people(atleast some) arent using it the right way JET. And there are some bitcoin companys ran by complete idiots who dont have a clue what their doing and only think about making money.
One day all those ignorant people will be wiped out of this scène and than it Will take a grip on the mainstream.. Not before that has happend.
So actually im not disagreeing with anything your saying.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:53:18
What do u use if i may ask? Linux?
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:53:49
So funny to read this about april first jokes, u guys know where april first came from?
a small village in the Netherlands, a fight with the "Geuzen".
Atleast, thats one theorie....
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:28:48
If this is a robocoin machine we as a community should not be happy at all with these shitty machines going out there! 
puts bitcoin in a bad spot light if u ask me
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:25:16
atleast i know a idiot downvoted it
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:51:10
Ive send like 0.0001 and 0.005 btc to check it out but my transaction is still not confirmed.
looks like it will take a while before it gets confirmed
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:17:40
this is why moving to litecoin isnt a bad idea, bitcoin will he hunted for a long time by stolen coins
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:33:04
true bolle, if everyone kept their samsung stocks and only a few were up for trade than also those few could skyrocket the price..
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:18:05
Good to hear that! Could me send me the link to your kickstart or explain what its about?
Have a great day
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:10:00
Ohh what a great country i live in! 
Bitcoin, weed and freedom.... Only the weather sucks..
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:44:23
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:01:45

@_date: 2014-03-03 00:18:56
Great explanation, could be very close to the truth... probably missing some details but they will reveal themselfs over time. 
Whatever happens, we are the revolution.
