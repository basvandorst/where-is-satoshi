Buy treasury bills directly and you can get way better rates. Exceeding 1% the last time I checked. But you ought to have your financial house in order to be taking such a step. Just because there’s better places usually to put money than cash, for most people. 
And at least with fraud there’s a path to resolution. I’ve never had an issue settling a fraud case with a bank. In bitspace, there is no one to help you when the shit hits the fan.

That’s not what people want though. Truly great men and women contribute to society, even after becoming wealthy. Look at Musk, for example. I recall an interview where he said if he retired to sip martinis on the beach, he’d lose his damned mind out of sheer boredom. 
Life isn’t about winning the monopoly game of economics and then relaxing and coasting *and wasting time* for thirty years. That’s something someone reprehensible would do, and there’s plenty of examples of these kinds of useless people.

Congress not acting in the best interest of the people has nothing to do with currency. 
With rising movements like Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party, or national populism, it's clear to the elites that they face an existential threat if they don't play fair. So I wouldn't hold my breath that it's "same as it ever was." That's a defeatist attitude that has no bearing on history. They'll act in their own best interest and right now that is in helping the middle class. 
Expect universal health care and a federal job guarantee at some point in the future, as well as massive education reforms. Also except corporate and middle class taxes to fall but taxes on the rich to rise.

Everyone (except bitcoiners apparently) knows that happened because they let Hugo Chavez put his cronies in charge of the oil industry and they didn't have a clue what to do. Also, oil has been in a bear market. So they stopped sufficient exporting and now with aggregate demand the same but with falling imports, prices rise. 
In a situation like this, any government spending, even small amounts will lead to inflation. 
This won't happen in the USA because (well, most of us) we're not idiots about how money works.

I know, you were arguing that war should be funded only via taxation using a gold backed currency for the betterment of everyone with the thesis it would prevent war. Except that in your system there is widespread oppression and poverty (austerity) along with the inability for a nation to defend itself during a time of war. People who advocate for this (like Ron Paul) ought to be almost considered traitors, in my view. That's the kind of idea Russia would like to push onto Americans via conspiracy channels, fostering distrust in the government and to get them to topple their own monetary and fiscal system accidentally. 


Me too and in fact that's written into our laws. As an oversimplified example, the fed's dual mandate is to control unemployment and inflation via monetary policy. Those two constraints put limits on how they can modulate the fed funds rate which in turn limits their ability to modulate the monetary supply. 


This isn't actually generally true. It can be true in very limited cases. But in the USA we have a growing GDP with an expanding population and growing productivity. So our money supply needs to grow in proportion to that to keep the velocity of money reasonable as well as to make available enough fiat to the public such that they can afford prices. 
If you permanently restrict the monetary supply, expect hoarding followed by a deflationary spiral as prices fall which makes revenues fall which leads to lay offs which leads to less aggregate demand which leads to further price reductions. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:37:24
But in the 30s it was demonstrated that a gold backed currency encourages hoarding. Bitcoin has the same problem. 
Perpetual deflation due to hoarding is much worse than actually sharing the wealth by giving people fiat that represents a share in the wealth of the country. And keeping the velocity of money high (less hoarding) in part results from a slightly inflationary currency. This is a good thing because it gets almost everyone involved in the economic growth and sharing their earned piece of the great wealth of the nation. 
You can beat inflation's damages to your savings easily using money markets, US treasuries, or equities, or real estate. Sure, you can gamble on gold but it's in a 40 year bear market. If you think "this is the year" it's going to turn around, okay, sure, but meanwhile I'll have my money in equities. 


Inequality results from poor fiscal policy. Blame it on your Congressman for not playing their referee game hard enough. They're letting the corrupt get away with thievery. That's your Congress, not your Fed or even the corporations directly. 
Congress has the power to tax the extreme rich and to redistribute to the middle class, effectively terminating wealth inequality, if only they were willing to spend political capital on doing what's right. 
Come on, you libertarian bitcoiners know how that political game goes but you don't want to face the fact that you hold contradictory beliefs: you want an end to inequality but you don't want to use the best tool we have to fix it which is taxes. That would be against your ideological platform to raise taxes on the rich.

Rent and student loans and expenses? That's just a matter of the creditor choosing to use bitpay or whatever services trusted third parties offer. 
The real problem is paying taxes with BTC. Guess who only accepts dollars for taxes? That's right, the IRS. They will never take BTC for taxes and therefore government spending will never be in BTC and therefore BTC (monero) will always be a small time collectible that drug dealers use to anonymously transact. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:52:13


Let's take the civil war as an example. Lincoln had to resort to fiat currency and the treasury issued the greenback. It would have been impossible to tax for the funds because there wasn't enough money supply in the economy to support it. 
Are you saying history would have turned out better if the Union couldn't fund the war? What about WW2? Would history have turned out better if we just said, "well, I guess the Nazi's won because we can't raise taxes high enough to stop him." 
Sometimes war is necessary. 
The way government gets fiat into the economy is it must spend before it taxes. Therefore, one thing that has to be true about a fixed supply unit of account is that taxes must always equal spending or else inflation or deflation will be a problem. 
In other words, those who demand a gold standard are demanding that economic growth stop at a moment when its lifting the third world out of poverty. 
Due to capital outflow risk, everyone around the world would have to simultaneously agree on a gold standard (or crypto) but it's impossible because no one will agree to the original distributions of those commodities. Nobody wants that either because we don't want growth to stop for many decades. 
I'm not sure if you're aware but going to a gold standard is tantamount to demanding austerity in 2017 and that's the wrong policy.

Definition of inflation


Inflation and deflation refer to the changes of price levels, regardless of whether changes in the monetary supply cause the impact. Because it looks the same whether it's a monetary supply shock or something like an export shock (the latter being how your favorite example of Venezuela ran into problems--when you make decisions that decrease your exports by an order of magnitude, expect your imports to get a lot more expensive, here, there isn't a substantial change to monetary supply required to cause prices to rapidly inflate). 


Really, I had it backwards. Bitcoin is showing inflation because it's buying power is rapidly falling. Prices of items relative to bitcoin are inflating fast. 
But it's deflating relative to the dollar. Looks like people value dollars more than your magic internet beans. 
Of course, these trends could temporarily reverse, but I think we all know the trajectory of the price of bitcoin will be downward. There's not even a good story about inflation to support it's speculation (like there was for gold in the 1980s when it reached its last peak, going on 40 years ago). Today's inflation is controlled and subdued.

Wars aren't paid for by taxes. That's a popular myth.


Yep, that's why we delegate the management of the economy game to our elected representatives in government. 


Sure so it's the job of our Congress and their apolitical counterpart, the Federal Reserve, to make sure the game is being played fairly. It's the job of the executive branch to enforce the rules of Congress and it's the job of the Supreme Court to make sure the other two aren't trampling over the public'a best interest. 
If there is rising inequality, petition your Congressman or woman to address it via fiscal policy. You can go beyond taxes and ask for deregulation in your local housing market to make it easier for builders to build, thus lowering prices. There's probably lots of things we need done like a federal jobs program for the unemployed or reforms to college and high school financing. We need a government budget actually passed rather than continuing resolutions and we need healthcare reform. Sometimes you wonder what in the hell Congress does all day. 
Or, if you want more of the limelight, organize something like Occupy Wall Street. That's how you get something done. Buying bitcoin isn't going to build the world you want to live in.
