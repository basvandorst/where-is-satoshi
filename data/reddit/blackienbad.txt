There are a lot of options, centralized and decentralized  
\-Crypto atm takes a lot of the juicy btc as fees, so it's not good, but it's easy to use  
\-Same for btc card (wirex etc..)
\-Binance and other centralized site
\-Localbitcoin and other decentralized site

damn dude, you must be the smartest in your class
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:26:44
Can you give me some link to do that?
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:29:39
51% attack is not as easy as some ppl make it sound
even if you have 51% of the hasing power and you want to rewrite one day you are around 144 blocks behind, and you actually get 1/2 block more than the other chain everyday, after 2 weeks (2016 blocks) the difficulty resets, so the chain with 49% hashing power has now 100% hashing power on their chain, even if you do it right after the difficulty has resetted so you have 2016 blocks for the next reset you will still be behind for around 100 or more days
Not counting that they are wasting energy that they already used to mine in the day that they are trying to erase, it's not an easy task to do a 51% attack, you need to have big miners really committed to pull it off
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:50:02
Neo actually did pretty good
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:19:35
Sad boi
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:18:01
I can get the state, but still, it would require a lot of money to pull it off and just mining empty blocks it's not enought with "just" 51%, because 49% of the time other ppl will mine full blocks, the network would be slow as fuck, but not dead
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:21:18
Which work?

@_date: 2019-07-27 10:53:13
Sorry dude, I just looked at my wallet and the price crashed, I swear it happens everytime, I will stop doing that
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:57:18
If you didn't sold you didn't sold, withdraw doesn't count
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:19:01
if you count the fixed supply and the fact that a lot of people have and will lose their wallet/coins it is kinda deflationary
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:07:58
The day thing was an example, I litteraly said the same thing about the difficulty reset
If you didn't mined them you need to create 51% of the hasing power out of thin air, its more than 50.000.000TH/s you can't even imagine how big it is
My point make sense if you understand how it works
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:54:52
I guess

Wait till we see 0.008 cent again
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:14:05
It's backed by PoW because PoW makes it secure, and it's backed by PoW because big investor are spending a shit tons of money on producing bitcoin and they won't sell at a loss, so under a certain price they won't sell, other than that it's backed by the fact that it has good properties, nothing more
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:20:46
They will come back
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:23:06
assuming he is 1 person, he started this alone, with some help from a guy (I can't remember the name of the guy), he spent years probably making it work, and it works only if it has a good amount of security (node/mining hash in the network) why would he not mine for atleast the first year, there is no logical reason, I was here since 2013, and even then there where not a lot of people, when he started he was alone
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:28:15


why would that be true? he has a vision, this doesn't mean that others can't do great things
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:55:30

@_date: 2019-07-27 19:01:38
thank you my dude
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:55:35
not hard to believe that he kept mining for a lot more, atleast untill it was a "real thing", so maybe he has even more than 1 milion
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:22:15
Unlucky boi
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:02:57
well, at this point it isn't, in a few years yes
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:40:45


it's possible
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:15:34
damn you coinsnitch
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:19:46
they couldn't actually cash out that fast and they can't do it slowly because we would notice that money from the first block have disappeared, the annoucement would just make the price drop and we could just do another bitcoin with the same tecnology without having goverments that control 1/21 of the coin
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:34:42
good choise
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:08:35
Same here
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:56:52
Thank you
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:36:31
If you cashout you should pay them
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:02:01


that's why I didn't said it for sure, calm down yall
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:23:31
mining at a loss? if you are alone you can do it with your toaster, if you are the only pc on the network you can use any device and in around 10 min you would have mined a block
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:26:11
If it is because they didn't payed taxed and used coinbase for that they are just stupid
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:19:32
Coinbase gave 13000 names of cripto users that made atleast 20k in gains
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:22:02
I'm comfortable buying now, I was comfortable buying at 5k and 3k, and bought again at 11.3k, I don't really follow the price, but now I started seeying it for a min or 2 and it crashed, lol
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:06:13
You can't say that he doesn't think that money are important, or he would waste his time creating better money
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:05:14
I don't usually watch the price, and even if I do I don't trade, I'm in IT I can't trade properly, but still the price counts, so I check it every once in a while
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:10:20
you can access them only in the channel that you used to receive them, the advantage as you said it's in a store customer transaction
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:32:39
Probably the ones that thought that they didn't have to pay taxes on the gains
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:24:48
basically what explained u/interrupt13 and bots
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:20:08
it was 5 month ago
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:21:41
It's always on sale
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:14:26
you are all asking that, there are a lot of ways, localbitcoin, IRL sell, other centralized sites etc..
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:55:46
yes, of course, let me do an example  
with inflation you lose x% of buying power, so let's say you have 50% of inflation, you will now pay 1.5 dollar for a can of coca cola instead of 1 dollar before you had that 50% inflation  
deflation is the other way around, deflation is better, but it's not good at high percantage, 2% inflation a year means you are losing 2% of buying power a year, 0.1% mean you are gaining 0.1% buying power a year, deflation is really good as long as it is not like 30% a year, inflation is just overall bad in the long term, a coin with 0.1% deflation is a lot more stable and healty than a coin with 2% inflation
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:19:54
there is a fixed supply, 1 milionish is in the first x wallet mined by satoshi and it's not going anywhere, this leaves us with 20 milion, i'd say ATLEAST 1 milion is already being lost and won't be recoverable, imagine this scenario, someone with 100 bitcoin dies, doesn't leave anything to access his wallet when he is dead, boom, 100 bitcoin will be blocked forever  
It has happened a lot and will happen in the future, even if we make different layer of difficulty, like it has been done for the internet, people will find a way to lose coin, and this itself makes it a little bit deflationary
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:31:24
If you liked btc at 6k you are going to cum with btc at 3k

@_date: 2019-07-29 13:35:04
If you make gains in crypto you should pay taxes, but that's not the point, the point is that we are giving up privacy, and that's not good at all
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:18:38
gulag are done, and privacy coin are private, if you buy bitcoin from a friend irl and swap it for a privacy coin they just can't know
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:56:03
Didn't knew, so yeah should be that
@_date: 2019-07-30 11:33:32
I'm not IRS, I don't know, probably they don't know too, that's new for them too
@_date: 2019-07-22 11:57:41
I don't think so
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:53:58
Withdraw from coinbase and then deposit to another site when you want to sell
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:58:36
You need to ask that to someone that knows your tax law, in Italy you don't need to pay unless you make 51k euros in trading per week
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:32:56
CASHOUT not withdraw

@_date: 2019-07-27 17:05:08
isn't it better?
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:02:01
what does it even mean, if the only way of buying crypto in 2013, or almost only way, was with cc and only my mom and dad had them (that I knew) how should I buy crypto
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:39:01
you don't need internet to confirm it, it's just easier to check if it's confirmed there
you can do everything in the bitcoin network with a full node
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:19:17
For now, that's why the biggest discussion is about scalability, there are already crypto that can handle a shit load of traffic
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:29:57

Since I'm in the space I only made money, gtfo
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:58:49
it's just silly to think about that, rn its like 70,000,000TH/s, if you use party that already are in the network that have no real reason to attack it you need 35700000TH/s, if you need to construct a 51% of the network out of thin air you would need to buy computers to reach like 5390700TH/s, that's just too much
@_date: 2019-07-22 11:59:29

Price went from 10000ish to 9400 in 2 minute, creating a chart like niagara's fall
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:36:28
You actually need to sell/buy directly to someone bitcoin to do that from the hardware wallet, if you buy it be carefull and wait for confirmation before you actually pay, bring a friend or 2 if it's an IRL exchange or have an escrow if it is an online thing
You would need to open a channel and close it directly to your hardware wallet, when you close it you actually pay fees for the transaction to be wrote on the blockchain, so unless you let it open it's the same thing
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:26:14
yes, but I guess the screenshot was taken during the bear market, so we could still be at 3k
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:27:12
in the long term will look like a really good price to buy
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:17:41
10k it's pretty high for the moment, we stayed at 3/4k for a year, calm down, price will grow eventually
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:14:10

of course is more stable than 100% inflation, inflation and deflation are both very dangerous if they are high, if you can choose between 1% inflation or 1% deflation the second one is better

not infinitely, 0,00000001 just this much, in lighting you can stretch it a little bit, but to change how bitcoin is divisible I guess we would need an hard fork and that part of the chain should win the war, so I don't think that it would be that easy

9k seems high, but it's not impossible, i'll say that it won't get below 8k in the low term and 6k in the long term

you need to pay a fking huge amount of money to have 51% of the network, millions wasted because we can create a new bitcoin the next day

we can assume that he mined a lot of the first block, and he kept mining for a long time to get the ball rolling, I made some math back in the days, and I really can't remember why 1 milion got stuck in my head, but my argument it's not about the milion, he could do it with 500.000 bitcoin and a lot less
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:23:54
why would you lose faith? The tecnology it's only getting better, when there is adoption there is liquidity, if you truly understand the tecnology the future of bitcoin is bright

 This was my highschool project for the final exam in july 2017, just  before the rally, it was a mining farm inside this case with a  raspberry, an usb hub with 5 asic miner and a fan to cool it down,  pretty simple project, but they went nuts they started asking question  like bitcoin was evil, they started trying to tell me that it was bad  and it was a scam, they still appreciated the efford and gave me 32/30,  at the end of the exam they almost all told me to get out and say that I  didn't knew what I was doing with my money
  
After the rally, when it  was at 18k they all fking called me to ask me about bitcoin and how to  buy them (when I did the exam it was around 1k), hodl my friends

Hi, I really liked the video, people in my country (Italy) don't really speak english or understand it enough to watch 24 minutes of a video, may I translate it, do a voice over and publish it? Of course I would say that this is all your work and I just translated it

In the first moment when btc goes up or down a lot alt ALWAYS went down like crazy, it's not news
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:49:06
Are you new here? every time bitcoin has had spike like that in price, in positive or negative, altcoins lost a lot, they will rise, unfortunately even the scams

Look at the volume of the last 2 years (or all time for all that matters) it's one of the highest, sometimes higher than the 20k bull run, the volume is here, I don't think we are just ready for the next bull run, but the volume it's high as fuck

We are in the early days, the avage joe doesn't know the difference between bitcoin and usd/eur, and honestly most shouldn't/doesn't care
We still aren't ready for them as I said, there are transaction, but ofc the high fees makes it pretty hard to use it in the bullish market, we will find a solution along the way

n1 that's the point we are discussing " how can we state that there'll be a steady demand? "  
n2 store of value, currency, anything would be better than the current system
n3 are you for real ignoring the fact that I stated 2 times, not 1, that it is not yet ready to be used as a global currency?

if there were 100 alt coins bettere designed why wouldn't everyone litteraly just use them instead of having btc has 50% of the space?
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:05:26


This is pretty buyest
n1: "Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it " dafq
n2: if everyone is an hodler the economy goes to shit, so there needs to be balance
n3: you need transaction to mine bitcoin, thus making miner (and the security of the whole network) stay  
I hodl, but I would mind spending my bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:47:48


Did you trace them, or are just saying that you could and in your head it's enough to say random stuff


it's scarse, fungible, divisible, it has all good quality that a form of money should have, and it's the first form of digital scarsicity, if that counts nothing to you I don't know why you are in this sub


Based on gold it's better than based on nothing + "meaningful expert" "all data" "evidence" provide some evidence, who are the expert? you can't really do a discussion with bs like this 


you are crazy, n1 there is no fking economic innovation, the last one was the credit card that it's still not used in my country (Italy) and it's been around for like 50 to 70 years, you are talking with your ass


you could copy it and make a better version, so do it, if you are convinced that you can do better

I could already create a bench32 address with ledger+electrum
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:21:46


so tell me, how do you know for what it is used? 


if it will consolidate as a store of value, let it be, we have plenty of other currency for a lot of purpose


no it doesn't


Maybe when we had the gold reserve, not after 1971


Bitcoin is 10 years old, it's been resilient to all the problems and the attack, it's the best cripto that we have right now, a lot of the other as of now are just ideas or shitcoin, lots of them don't quite work FOR NOW, you can't really grasp what this mean do you?  
10 years is not a long time when you compare cripto our actual economy that had thousands of year to develop

if you have a wallet with 1 private key and let's say 1.2 btc, that private key protects the entire 1.2 btc, by sending only 0.5 btc you would send important information about the security of your private key, so basically you send 1.2 btc, 0.5 to the address that you want and 0.7 btc back to you on a different private key  
It's a matter of security

@_date: 2019-05-22 15:30:26
this only proves that normal people don't have that much fund to have 1 milion output, wow, I didn't knew, thank you


21 milion coin, 100.000.000 satoshi per coin, 100.000.000\*21.000.000 satoshi, and it could even be changed, it's not overly scarse, at all, the other one are property that are mandatory for good coins, and bitcoin has them
 A reddit post, wikipedia page and a survey are NOT  "meaningful expert" "all data" "evidence" 


Sure, you need to tell me how my country works, you are delusional, maybe 15% of italian places accept the credit card payment, and those who do are not happy when you pay with it


what happens when you copy it? your network is not secured by the thousands of peer that protect the bitcoin network, you have a bad copy with no security or added value, you don't really know how this works, uh?
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:16:03


no, that just proves that the account with a lot of transactions doesn't belong to private


lol, that is bs, creating currency out of thin air is bad


there is no consensus about this topic, you just hear people with your same idea and you think you got it right, and then you even say " It doesn't have any good qualities that money should have - and has 100 terrible qualities. " about good the good properties of money that I list, here educate yourself kiddo [ and I already know you will attack point 8, if you want to, you will just prove that you don't understand that we are in an early stage and you don't quite grasp liquidity as a concept


most technically better? damn you are for real delusional

It's not a science, but still something that you can't ignore
