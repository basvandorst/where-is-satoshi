u/bitcoin-yoda can't help it. He's socially incompetent.

I just make hats. I don't know. Sorry.

By far the most trustworthy digital asset exchange in the world.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:02:20

700% altcoin vs. 70% Bitcoin.

Use? More like speculating, buying out of FOMO.

I think they have Asperger's and regret from not owning much Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:04:15
What's your warning exactly? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:55:07
Or the Real Korea.

I think Jihan had the power when other miners bought his hardware while he mined againt them.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:58:20
Because the AXA-funded Blockstream Core Dragon's Den (ABCD) hired more redditors on Fiverr. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:12:49
Because you must be a redditor of at least 5 years to not be a shill. OKAY.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:12:54
All good advice so far and this is the best one.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:51:00
Pretty good. The next thing you  need to do is sell all your Bitcoin and tweet hard. Also buy my hats you bitch!
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:01:08
Bubble influx + shills from the Blockstream Core side of the scaling debate 
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:43:45
Thanks. Can't they change the code anytime? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:01:42
Banks are terrible. I prefer insurers like AXA.

R U OK?
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:55:23
It appears Blockstream Core is a cartel and Chairman Samsung Mao has Asperger's. I can't prove it. That's why I use the word "appears." I don't want to be right, but I have to call it like I see it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:04:14
Buying. The trend is your friend.
