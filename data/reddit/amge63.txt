I have a question. I ordered one of your Reloadable Prepaid Credit Card. Regardless of the large fee's you charge I feel it'll be a good option for making semi-large purchases while travelling in different countries. Unfortunately, I didn't do quite enough research before I ordered it because I have no clue how to reload said card. 
Your website says, "To reload your Bitcoin Prepaid credit card, choose an amount listed below. In the following screen, click on the type drop down, and select reloadable". 
But there isn't an "amount listed below" anywhere on your site. Can you give me proper instructions on how load the card?
Also, you claim the card takes 7-10 days to receive it by mail. I ordered it 19 days ago.

I appreciate the recommendation. It ended up being a blockchain congestion issue. It  posted in my wallet about 8 hrs later.  I'm actually extremely happy with jaxx wallet. It has shapeshifter integrated right in the wallet.

Don't "post" meaning to my wallet?

I looked it up. The fee was $22.50 USD.
 I had $430.93 post in my wallet. 
So, Rocketcoin made $46.57 off of the transaction. That's 7 or 8%

I just flipped 50% of my bitcoin to bitcoincash. Gonna stick with it for 30 days and hope for the best. ����
