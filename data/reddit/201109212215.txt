RISC-V will come and grow on its own. Western digital is converting all their silicium to it. 2 billion chips/year.
What they get from it is:
* No more ARM licenses &amp; royalties. For dumb cores which do hardware management like checksums and keeping track of unusable sectors, there is no point in paying a license for bleeding edge chips.
* Vastly increased customization: For databases: some CPUs have special hardware instructions to project data. Ie they get some bytes, and do the reading to only get the two id and name fields in "SELECT id, name"; where all other fields of the table are. These instructions is available in SPARC systems sold by Oracle. Now, Western digital will be able to push down this instruction in the HDD controller itself. And vastly increase the HDD throughput for database workloads.
RISC-V is here to stay. Eventually we will have fully open-source stacks, like linux and all the apache projects are for software. 
Also, regarding the intel chips:
There are chips that are not vulnerable to these kind of attacks. The ones you find in smartcards. They have been hardened to a wide variety of attacks, including grinding the surface and listening with micro-antennas. Also, they are vastly less complex and easier to formally prove.
I hear also that this kind of chips are getting into the Ledger products.
Buy hardware wallets people! They are really worth it.

It is not widespread by any means, yes. And we do agree on that. I don't get why you say "Just stop spreading this" when I come with facts.
The numbers are that Venezuela, a developing country, has a disproportionate amount of participants in localbitcoins. And that's a signal. No it is definitely common in Venezuela, but it is starting to serve a purpose there. It is growing, and growing fast there.
Other numbers from here: 
Cambodia: 15M population, 338 vendors
Venezuela: 30M population, 12999 vendors
Malaysia: 30M population, 2915 vendors
France: 60M population, 7531 vendors
See what I mean?

On-chain, but off-line. As opposed to using coinbase, for example. 
Basically you go to a guy, you give him some shit-pesos-papers, and he signs a transaction to your benefit on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:51
It is a clever attack, unfortunately :/
I still have some BCH from the fork, but can't be bothered to put them into BTC. I'm kinda hoping someone else (a whale) does it for me: BCH price collapses, and BTC gets pumped by the same amount.
I can't say the same about this new shitcoin, though. I'm sort of forced to install their software -which I don't trust- to cash out :/
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:37:49
It depends on what you mean by target, but you can still say you own some.
If that's nagging for money, there's nothing to be done.
If it is the security issue you are talking about, you can create a fragmented backup and erase your private key. 
I don't have a large amount of BTC by any means, but that's what I did. I use  I created a 3 of 5 backup and distributed the 5 among: myself, a vault that I rent, my parents, and 2 friends. The two friends each and the parents don't know each other. 
With this I am protected against: loss of fragment, stealing of my fragment, loss of my fragment by someone I gave it to, and stealing of my fragment by someone I gave it to.
I sleep fine. If I ever get attacked, I'll give my fragment and call the police afterwards.

That doesn't mean we won't have adoption of bitcoin as the main carrier of value IMHO. 
Yes, inflation is needed to build an competitive economy on. Yes, inflation is good for the group. Money has to flow in the economic system in order to have a shot at keeping the same value; and that's what is good.
But inflation is bad for the (rich) individual, and in the end it is the small individual acts that matter. You and I -and larger parts of the population- will keep larger and larger proportions of their cash in BTC. And merchants will bend over backwards to be able to capture some of that value. Bitcoin as a payment option will become the rule.
IMHO we'll have an economic crisis, because deflation. If they can adopt bitcoin, the governments will remain stable. Even as they print money that has less and less value (furthering the fiat inflation, and the deflation of bitcoin). 
Currently, inflation is about 1%. When bitcoin will grow by volumes of 1% of the economic activity, we will reach the turning point where this inflation-deflation cycle kicks in.
As they adopt themselves bitcoin, the governments will rid themselves of their massive debts (print money till the debt is zero).
Hopefully a few fiat banks get turned into ashes along the way.
And no one will be able to print the new worldwide money.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:08:57
I beg to disagree. There are 12k vendors/sellers for Venezuela on localbitcoins; which is about 4 times the offer in France, compared to the population.
While not widespread, Bitcoin is definitely attracting sustained interest in Venezuela.

The three of them could collude and not even need to use force. 
They are friends and family, though. I trust each of them a fair amount to do the RightThing at 0.99 probability each. And they don't know each other. My security over them colluding is at  1 - (1 - RightThing ) \^ 3. So 0.999999. Without them trying to search for the others. Which I could detect.
This is the model without cofounding factors, but I don't intend to piss each of them off at the same time; or piss any of them off at all for that matter.
My security over "two of them just get together and brute force your shit open" is at 1 - (1 - 0.9999) * (their actual willingness to beat up a friend, knowing they already committed treason). Still good in my book.
I guess the cofounding factor of me dying could have a special case, where I tell them to open the envelope on my death and follow some instructions there.
The 0.99 number I am confident in. First because these are close friends I've known for a long time. Second because they don't know much; I gave them an envelope and told them not asking questions was part of the thing. And third, all they have to do is nothing. Believe it or not, doing nothing is the easiest thing to do and I entrust them to do so ;)
Truly, I sleep fine.

Channels and wallets are different things. Actually you need a wallet to have a channel. The wallet stores securely your private keys, and it also signs transactions or smartcontracts (which a channel is).
Maybe you wanted to have your paycheck coming in one channel, and the daily expenses in another channel? In this case, you're going to have to close and reopen them from time to time, as they will get imbalanced pretty fast. You're going to have to pay fees each time you open it, for each channel. If you had them both on the same channel, they would even out and you would have no fee to pay.
This is in essence the scaling solution. It transfers bidirectional flows off the chain, because they can even out. Any isolated unidirectional flow or one time payment is going to have to hit the blockchain and incur a fee. 


The fees are the exact current bitcoin fees. Which are about 4USD per transaction as of now. But as more and more people open channels to do their business and don't need to hit the blockchain, this fee is going to go down a lot in my opinion. 
Also, this is what's the layer 2 is about. I don't know what's in the pipeline for layer 3. Side chains, maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:14:56
Predicting x100 here, but only when we have the next Wall Street crash with the associated bailouts.
And then another x100 once bitcoin grows to 1% of the USD's usage, thus nullifying the USD inflation benefits (which will trigger more money printing and further bitcoin's deflationary power).

Such a great photo.

I know enough about it that double-spends on different Tangles get resolved to the heaviest tangle. Aka a transaction can get cancelled arbitrarily long after it has been recorded, in the case of no connectivity. Some work can be done in order to provide some garanties, I guess.
Also: they currently have a central node, which is supposed to be taken out after some time. 
Doesn't feel ready for prime time yet, but the concept is well worth being explored. If I had a time, I'd buy a little of them just to see.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:01:42
Basically, yes.
NYTimes does not have to close it at the end of the 30 days, tough. They can use it to pay their writers at the end of the month, for example. Or they can even pay an exchange to get some USD with it.
The only times they have to close it is if their channel provider wants to close it; or they have to resize it: it is getting imbalanced, or it is not big enough to weather the variation between the time they collect the article payments and the time they pay their writers.
I guess for accountability rules you might want to close it and reopen it on a yearly basis, maybe?
Same goes for the visitor. He gets paid a salary once a month, and he buys stuff all month long through his channel provider.
I think we are going to see a lot of channel balances look like the [Sawtooth signal](
When paying with lightning will be the norm, I speculate that:
If all channels follow this usage pattern, this means the amount of maximum imbalance over a month in all channels will be equal to the capitalization of bitcoin.
... which means this capitalization will be 12 times the GDP of economic activity that occurs in bitcoin.
On another note, I was wondering if I should put my BTC to use in a lightning node; and offer liquidity to the network for a price.

I believe so, if the client allows it. Be sure to check the client actually executes it; get the official amount of the new receiving address from  blockchain.info for example.
Like usual you should also wait for a certain amount of blocks being build on top of the one that contains your transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:40:59
Yeah. I wanted to do the double-spend and then run off to Kraken to cash it out, but I'm too lazy. 
I don't have enough BTC to warrant sufficient interest into getting a mere +7% increase.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:52:26
I have been wondering if the refusal (by comitters, by miners) to allow for bigger blocks has something to do with the halvening.
Maybe to try and create and test the transaction fee market; to have a smoother transition for miners.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:50:45
They only have [2.5% hashing power](
It will take them 6 hours 40 mn *on average*.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:38:45
Then went to $140, and now at 190$. I wonder how the [Bitcoin Cash Futures at ~$300]( will resolve with regards to this. Anyone know who is backing them up?
Still no BCH block, though. With 2.5% HashRate it is to be expected. It means about 40 BTC blocks have to go by before the first one; and we're like at 35.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:40:55
Bittrex has it as [0.11 BTC per BCC]( so ~$300. I also saw some BCC Futures at ~$300 USD.
I guess some arbitration will take care of all that.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:36:48
This looks like a flatline to me. Or maybe the first block to be mined takes a lot of time because it inherits an initially high difficulty?
NINJA EDIT:
The fees seems to be high. Looks like people that are very invested in having their transaction pass. My money is on double-spenders protecting themselves against replayability; so that they can go to an exchange and make a run on these new coins.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:14:14
To clarify the percentages: BTC has taken a slight dip of 4% since the fork.
And if you had 1 BTC, you now have 1 BCC + 1 BTC; and this BCC is priced by Kraken to be 7% of the price of the BTC.


Oh they've been selling. 7% is where it ~virtually crashed to. That's free money, but that's little money now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:29:51
!! Beware of transaction replayability.
Use your wallet.dat on both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core.
Transfer all your coins to another address you control. On each chain/clients.
Verify independently that both transactions have gone through; creating effectively a double-spend.
Now you are sure transfers to other parties cannot be replayed; and that one merchant that you send 1 BTC to will not try to get your BCH as well.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:15:57

They can do whatever they want, but one thing is certain: their activity has to build up first some liquidity in BTC.

Your formulation is dishonest.
They are *disconnecting* peers that use service bits 6 and 8, because these bits represent a Hard Fork in consensus rules. And *BTC1 happens to be implementing this Hard Fork*. Note that this isn't even replay protection; but just better usage of sockets as these nodes won't be able to exchange relevant information. 
The elephant in the room being that a Hard Fork won't be implementing a replay protection scheme. Also, that people do not fully realize this is indeed a Hard Fork.

The French government published a quite comprehensive report on bitcoin, and the results are: bitcoins are to be considered as commodities, and taxed as such. They lie in the article when they say: "empêché l'administration française de créer un régime fiscal ad hoc". Taxing is the first thing the administration did with regards to bitcoin.

* BCH's market cap is mostly made of BTC hard hodlers from before the fork who will undoubtedly dump it at some point; at least by yours truly (at 3.02% presently)
* and when talking market cap, it is meaningless without a somewhat liquid market; 
* and frankly, there is *a lot* of garbage down the list
