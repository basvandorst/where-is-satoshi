So... doesn't then also follow that - and i'm not an expert - that even with a 20mb block size or a 100- or 1000mb block size miners will be incentived to keep the blocks as low size as possible while still keeping the network running?
I assume 100mb blocks will propagate slower so will have higher orphan rates. So even if there was a 100mb block size or a limitless blocksize for that mattee, if a portion of the miners would place a softcap at say, 15mb because they've calculated that that is the optimum size to balance risk vs reward, then everyone with higher block limit will naturally start to gravitate towards that lower soft limit because they would otherwise be orphaned to often by faster propagating smaller blocks.
Why is this not the answer to the blocksize debate, at least until there will no longer be a block reward?
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:41:08
As a reply to your edit: 8mb will be the *limit* of the block size. It will not mean you will start having to process 8mb blocks right away or even anytime soon for that matter.
By the time you will, much time and ideas to make processing 8mb blocks a lot easier will probably have come to the surface.

@_date: 2015-06-01 14:22:22


Honest question: what will happen when block rewards dry up after a couple halvings? Weren't the higher transaction fees as a result of increased network usage meant to become the miner incentive? How will that be possible if every transaction will be let through for minimal fee?

Your time frame is WAAAY to short.
You jumped in to a volatile market in a bullish sentiment, that relatively quickly after turned bearish, and still is. Seeing this fast turn in sentiment, you are expecting the reverse to happen quickly as well (from bearish to bullish). This is just not how sentiment works on a global scale.
It takes at least 2-3 years (ATLEAST) to change sentiment in a globally noticeable way.
If it was dying, merchant adoption and all the rest you were talking about would decline as well. It isn't, it's increasing. Just don't expect to have the human emotional global sentiment to change with it exactly as rapidly. That's impossible.
Give it a year or two. Right now you are prematurely jumping to conclusions.

@_date: 2015-05-31 12:26:39
This I believe is the biggest weakness of bitcoin that has arized up to this point. I kinda worry about it.
It is very much possible that as bitcoin grows, different people will develop different ideas about how the system should work. Not unlike Democrats vs. Republican which both live and use the same 'system'. If the US would need 80-90% of consensus before a politcal 'hard fork' would ever be acted upon, nothing would ever happen because that percentage is simply not achievable.
So either we get used to some amount of bitcoin hardforks in the future that will only ever be supported by a slight majority, or we have to come up with a better way of deciding these things in the future. Can you imagine the different visions and opinions when instead of aprox 2mm people 100mm will be using bitcoin in a multitude of different cultures with different values and goals? My god, hardforking would become impossible.
Now one could argue no it wouldn't, because: " universal economic incentive". But the same could theoretically be said about any two political parties. They both are going for the most economic rewards (at least partially), but the fact that the entire system is too complicated to be completely understood by default means that different parties will come to understand it differently. The same will go for bitcoin I think.
Bitcoins strength is that it works without trust. But if different people begin to 'trust' different aspects of the system more than others, what's the end result? (Genuine question, I do not mean to suggest anything).

Alright thanks for elaborating!
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:09:06
Yea I agree.
But what I've understood about the problem is not that most transactions will be able to occur off chain but that the solutions that make this possible will not be ready (and widely accepted) before blocks will become full, so we kinda need (says one camp,) a solution in the mean time that adresses this.
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:38:01
Could you elaborate in your last sentence?
Why would that require "bigger chunks"?
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:15:37
Are you not overlooking the whole developing world with this reasoning?
5cents can be kind of a big deal underdeveloped countries. Which is exactly where te biggest possibilities lie for bitcoin.
5 cents is a couple of rupees in india. Thats like what 1 dollar is to US residents. Kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:32:47
Not wanting to risk losing any block would not mean they would switch per sé. it would mean that they would have to continue mining both forks. 
So unless I'm missing something that could not be the deciding factor.
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:20:09
Cool, very original!
I probably don't understand the concept well enough so for me the question arises; how is this concept monetizable? In other words, what do you get out of it, just out of curiosity.
Is it simply a matter of advertising revenue $ &gt; bitcoin spending $ ?
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:36:29
From reading all your answers in this post I conclude that you are afraid that 20mb block sizes will (among others) 1) decrease decentralization, and 2) Will have the potential to split bitcoin into two different coins if there will not appear fast consensus on which form will win, which in turn will effectively destroy the trust in bitcoin and a network and decrease its value and will for a lot of purposes make in useless.
On the other hand there is the current 1mb limit. And this limit is getting pretty limiting, pretty fast. If this limit is reached, it would be reasonable to conclude that for many purposes bitcoin will become less valuable and usable as well.
The solution would be different bodies and companies like the lightning network that will ease the load off of the actual blockchain, creating speed on the one hand where needed/wanted, and keeping decentralization on the other hand where needed/wanted.
The crucial factor to me here seems to simply be time. As the network usage increases, the 1mb limit will be reached and things will start to get traffic jammed more and more. The question then becomes. Will these other bodies and companies be ready to ease the load of the back of the blockchain before this limit is reached and starts clogging up the system. And as far as I have been able to conclude the answer is 'no'.
If this is indeed the case, then a different solution has to be found within this timespan. I just don't see people being happy with massively increased transaction costs for any extended period of time because of full blocks, plus the fact that any increase in transaction cost will not clear out the surplus of transactions. It will simply let the one with the biggest fees through. If everyone would increase their fees. You'd still have a surplus of transactions coming in.
I am not arguing for an increase to 20mb, that number to me seems just as arbitrary as 1mb. But would it not be reasonable to conclude that we need *some* increase so that there will be enough time for other developments and bitcoin will not lose its user value before these developments are ready? 20mb might actually be too big, causing the network to devide into two camps and thus two blockchains. But what about a blocksize of 2mb or3 mb for example? This doesn't seem like much in contrast to 20mb, but it's still a 100%/200% increase. And it should give us just the time we need to finish LN (and others), while still being so agreeable to most parties as to not create any huge chasm as an effect to a hard fork. Again the crucial factor seems to be (just a little more) time.
Could you state briefly if/where you think I have it wrong. And more importantly what you think would be the best intermediary solution with regards to centralized bodies not being ready to take the load off of the blockchain before the 1mb limit is reliably reached? (Because I do feel that not doing anything until then will not be a solution).
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:05:52
Well sure, but if you mine the (ultimately) failed fork, all the coins you will have mined will not even exist any longer isn't it?
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:07:24
The idea is that, just like crash tests can use dummies instead of real people, a bitcoin network simulator doesn't have to make actual hash calculations to still render relevant outcomes on different variables. As long as block solving is simulated correctly on the wanted variables.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:06:27
Honest question, is it clear in any form when implementations such as these could actually start affecting the price beyond speculators becoming more bullish again?
I'm really not an expert, but I recon that NASDAQ could basically give out 1 trillion stock shares by coloring single satoshis with just 1 bitcoin. So am I correct in making the conclusion that implementations like this, however awesome, won't really create more demand for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:56:57
It's not even 2 minutes long...
But in case you are actually deaf or something: All the additional utilities that bitcoin will be used for should see the price of bitcoin rise more or less linearly with this increase in utility because otherwise miners will not have an economic incentive to mine bitcoin.

I'm quite new to the concept of trezor and this is the first time I've actually seen a live working version of it. To be honest for some reason I had the notion that was much bigger, like a calculator haha. Don't ask me why.
Anyway, in the video the guy says that your private keys are stored on the trezor and never leave it. Does this mean that if I would loose that USB sized device, I would have lost all my BTC, or is there some kind of backup available?

What I understand of it is that these shorters are simply long and shorting their own bitcoin. Which leads to a neutral account balance no matter what the price does. Except now since they have bitcoin, they will also get BCC. Which they wouldn't get if they were in fiat.

Someone put 200 btc for sale at 2999.98 so people have to buy that up first before it can go higher.
Thing is, as soon as btc is bought, new btc is put for sale at that price.
There effecitvely have to be bought in the 1000's of btc at around 3000 usd before we are able to cross it.
There's a lot of strategy involved. Push it long enough down with a big sell wall, and price will go down like it has now. Thi s gives the opportunity to the 2999.98 seller to buy back lower.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:50:43


no, if there are 100 btc for sale at 3000 usd and I put a sell order for 100 btc at a price of 4000 usd, the order 
book will get me the cheapest price, so it will eat up all of the 3000 usd coins.
Check this order book for a few hours on and off, you'll learn a lot 
Watch for sell walls and buy walls.
Basically a sell wall is a large sell order (like the one at 3000usd.) If the order is big enough, it scares buyers off, because if you buy a piece of that wall up, but the wall is too big and can ultimately not be crossed, you have now bought the top and will make a loss selling lower. That is why walls are so powerful.
Now, could you buy 150 btc at 4000 usd when there's a sell wall up at 3000 usd of 100 btc? Sure, once the 3000 usd coins are eaten up, 50 are bought slightly above 3000. And it will indeed push above 3000. However the same idea goes: There is a big change that if you do that on just one exchange, the other exchanges will act as a buffer, pulling your exchange back down (this is EXACTLY what happened last night with bitfinex who came above 3000,  and you will have again bought the top.
This stuff is pure psychology.

@_date: 2017-06-12 15:51:17
No one prevents you from pulling the wall as soon as it gets eaten.
Having 100 coins off your wall eaten, then pulling the other 900, will usually rocket the price up *beyond*  where it would otherwise have gone because of the pent up pressure. Thus creating the opportunity of selling your other 900 coins for more than you otherwise could have.
What I then do or example is wait till the wall is almost eaten up, then buy a small last piece of it, wait for it to burst up (or down if I short sell into it) and sell 5 minutes later when the move overshoots and becomes unsustainable.
Watch the order book, look at those big fat orders. Watch them move, watch them get pulled and placed again and pulled again as price comes closer.
Best way to learn is to put 100 usd on an exchange and put actual money on the line. You'll never loose the 100 usd (quickly) because that would mean it would have to go to 0. But having money on the line makes sure you pay attention. After a week or so, you'll start to get a feel for the movements. Best learning school you could wish for.
Then it becomes like poker, you'll loose some, but if you have a strategy you'll win more.

I dont know how localbitcoins work. But you should have a wallet/public address and a private key. The private key is for sending bitcoins to other wallets/public/receiving addresses.
You can get a receiving address from coinbase simply by going to the deposit area on their website and copying it.
The plug the private key into an app like mycelium or bitcoin core or whatever, tell it how much you want to send en plug in your coinbase public address as the receiver.
I do advice you to read the sidebar. It explains all of this and it is kind of necessary information to understand.

The point is this: if you have a total of 3 bitcoins in a system. Together worth 3000 dollars. Then every bitcoin has 1/3 of the total value of the system. Now if the goverment ADDS 1 more bitcoin that is also given a value of 1000 dollars. You nou have a system that is worth a total of 4000 dollars. Meaning that every bitcoin has gone from being worth 1/3 of the total value to being worth 1/4 of the total system. If you owned one of these bitcoins. You wouldnt like that.
This is why it can be said that the US dollar has lost 97% of its value. Just as one of the 3 original bitcoins in my example has lost some of its value in the system
Adding more decimal places to a satoshi does not create this problem.
