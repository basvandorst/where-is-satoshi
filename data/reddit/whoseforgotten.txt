Well hopefully the answers given can clear things up for you!
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:20:53
Great info! Thanks brother 
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:09:19
Well thought out TA what’s the cycle he’s using as an indicator?

The tree of “bitcoin” will never die 
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:57:52
Personally i don’t think bitcoin is a scam but something very innovative and positive that the world needed and can only improve with more ideas flowing from the tree of “Bitcoin and blockchain”
@_date: 2018-11-17 05:33:45
Didn’t say i read about this for a year. I’m a forex trader and just recently started doing research and most of these question are toss ups for people just starting out and want somewhere to find answers down in the comments
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:50:34
As in forex trading, you’ll have to do your research but you can make profit off of shorting and going long anytime of the day. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:56:34
It didn’t hit 20K like you said so i think my prediction will come true before yours. Way to give it more than an hour before it reaches price you dipshit
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:44:59
Using BRD as well and something to note, if you need to spend that BTC shopping or outwards for some reason.. you can manually change the speed of the transaction from what i learned from their support!
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:11:36
I don’t get how 5% = 51% attack

The returns will be massive next year and there won’t be anything like it in our lifetimes sort of how amazon or apple stock started out.
I don’t day trade was in forex for a minute and learned that i was a swing trader that held for over a week or two at a time. I was always seeing long term and not into scalping
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:02:04
That’s fine by me lol I’ve been buying gradually right before the shitty drop from November 2018 bought a little more after the hard sell off
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:55:01
The questions start on page 5...
Anyways good link and important questions if we want to scale and head to the moon and not be a manipulated market by the big money
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:44:51
Wow just like that we hit the resistance line and it’s having a correction.. crystal ball does wonders huh
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:00:53
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:33:31
Lmao so throw away your bitcoin to gamble no one on the leaderboards have came close to even. Stupid people throwing money away ��
Good concept to take the btc away from dummies
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:37:12
Reddit troll just made an account lmao go away
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:07:38
There’s a reason why you made your account. Keep on trolling people reddit no life ��
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:21:49
So let’s bet some bitcoin on price reaching what first? I’ll post my wallet you can send me .5 bitcoins when I’m right in the next week.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:45:08
To state that it’s impossible is just not correct, before purchasing any bitcoin from any available place that sells you should check the requirements to withdraw. The scanner id is having problems but mine was verified after 12ish hours when the “issues” were still live. They also asked for me to email my id to them but just keep trying and think before you make any bitcoin purchase about how you are going to withdraw to your own private hardware wallet because not your keys not your coin
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:39:11
Make sure your actual cashapp account is verified before you do the bitcoin section. They also told me they were having problems with the scan id a week ago for me but i had to verify my account first which i figured out on my own and then the bitcoin id scan worked
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:17:24
Still being a jack ass thinking you’re the intellectual here and defining what a chart is.. pretty funny but your comment from earlier is gonna look dumber by the day. 
Enjoy losing money and staying poor!
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:28:50
We are at a huge resistance the bears are trying to stop the run and short
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:31:35
More money needing saved up I’m currently developing a video game so it gives me time to invest more down the road
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:37:45
Nah just my thinking from past experience in trading the forex and reading charts!
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:23:31
It’s going to pass the recent ceiling we hit and lmao go to the moon what else did i previously say? 
TA isn’t real though
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:09:47
The censorship of people that don’t agree with you is becoming more rampant with the communists in the US...
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:39:04

@_date: 2019-05-16 01:35:39
Lol? I’m just taking the information from the chart and making my interpretations from how the market has reacted in the past that’s all buddy
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:45:27
So bitcoin won’t pass 7k in the future? Wtf are you even saying..
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:25:54
Oh it’s great tool as a second option to the big exchanges! Loving it right now when i need to buy and hodl more haha
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:07:50
My guess is if it reaches 10k it’s coming down to around 7K for the dip and then sky rocketing past the ATH of 19K
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:59:40
No i wasn’t my honest thoughts were 6.5k -7k ish
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:22:11
No i want the Bitcoin i made the bet with you on your behalf.. 
Stfu and go eat a dick
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:34:22
Damn bro i must be an Oracle cause we touching 13k by the end of next month if it’s not happening in May. Your comment really makes me think you have no idea how a market or chart works ��. FOH
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:38:59

@_date: 2019-05-16 01:34:18
Talked with my parents literally yesterday and said their 401K was down by 50K just this week.. the method of buying in intervals is correct but i managed to convince them they need a small investment in Bitcoin just because it’s going to be going up all year.
They gave me 1K to invest yesterday and they’re up 100$ after transaction fees!
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:29:34
Yes I’ve had large amounts up to 1800 moved off within 40 minutes or less depending on confirmations pretty fast and 0 problems from my end
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:55:01
Cashapp is the best currently but it’s not a wallet where you should store. Move it off with an easy withdraw to a safe hardware wallet. Not your keys not your bitcoin! Loving cashapp currently 0 fees and the price spread is increased by maybe 50
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:22:03
If prices holds we see something pullback around 7K, then skyrocket past the ATH of 19K. 
If we pass 9-10k, all bets are off and the train has left the station!
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:33:23
Is your actual cashapp account verified? 
I had to verify the actual cashapp account then verified my bitcoin withdraw
Smart on you for only spending a 1$ and I’m sorry their support isn’t responding... really sucks to hear because I’m enjoying using their free service to purchase bitcoins when i need to.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:30:15
Nvm you need to verify your account before you set the bitcoin withdraw up.. had the same problem
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:19:12
Yeah this hasn’t aged well at all and it hasn’t even been 24 hours lmao i guess i am an Oracle like you said huh
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:43:24
Yes you can withdraw it to any wallet that has a qr scan or the code itself
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:13:48
Wouldn’t be opposed to having the government monitor the exchanges and making sure they aren’t doing something shady behind the scenes but only if they report the findings and don’t join in on whatever scheme the exchanges have going if they’re doing shady shit. 
Market manipulation is hard to stop with whales having more than 5k coin and a single dump causes a flash crash like from last week. Not sure how to solve this question
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:44:32
I’ve been using it recently and it’s actually better to buy on cash app than regular Coinbase! I usually transfer my bitcoin with a withdrawal to my wallet and within 30-45 minutes was there. They also charge “0 fees when buying, selling, withdraw”
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:58:39
It was me go look at my post and comments of saying we are at a resistance but i get downvoted to hell for saying anything related to TA
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:46:09
Nah I’m thinking it’s going to break above 13k-14k and stay near or above at the end of the year unless something crazy like last bull run happens which was not healthy
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:36:30
After bitcoin hits the moon for the 2nd time and drops near 7,000$ I’m buying even more. How was that complicated to get ? Lmao this is the crowd in crypto huh
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:46:24
Hit the resistance like i thought and we are seeing the correction hopefully doesn’t go below 7K
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:12:17
We will all use the same currency of Bitcoin and Satoshis in less than a decade
-Seen the future
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:50:16
I think i had to verify my drivers license after verifying my actual cashapp account. They have a known issue of scanner id currently but mine made it through that was my only issue!
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:59:13
My guess is we see this go towards 6500$ -7000$ range before we take off on the big bull run for the rest of the year. Next 2 days will be telling but could take another week depending what the market does!
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:37:07
All your fiat is in bitcoin? Being payed in bitcoin or? That’s good I’m looking to get half of my fiat in bitcoin and gradually keep buying
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:07:37
I’d have to read the questions and think on it but from what i skimmed over. Sounds like their concerns lie in manipulation from future and options standpoint and not being able to analyze the market in a fair manner if these players have the power to manipulate. 
They are asking what we think of having the government eyes on these exchanges and some resolution to future and options trading to stop big money manipulation or downright if we care about it? 
Correct me if I’m wrong but i quickly read the questions lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:54:51
Afraid not i used Coinbase as my first bitcoin purchases but never anything below 100$ because the fees are pricey as hell on top of just getting your bitcoin in a wallet confirmed
