Last summer I built myself a gaming PC with an HD7970. I started following bitcoins earlier this year, and it wasn't until last month that I realized that I could mine with it. It spits out a few bitcents a day, and I was thinking about investing in some FPGA/ASIC equipment to add to it, but I've been hearing that mining just isn't worth it anymore.

I did that when calculating the profits of an Avalon ASIC miner, and each month yielded less and less bitcoins, as expected. But what I found interesting was that if you increased the bitcoin's value each month to adjust for inflation (I did approx. +$25 a month going by recent trend) the absence of pure bitcoin was weighed out by the rising value. A 50gH/s miner would turn out about $6200-$6700 a month consistently until the end of the year when calculating increasing difficulty and value.  This is really why I am asking if its worth it to mine, because I would invest money off my own research like this, but I know there has to be some variables I overlooked.

It really pisses me off that some media groups are getting the first few off the line just for the publicity, and wired is just wasting all their mining profits because its just a distraction even though they are still running the box on a 24/7 live stream. Its not like you could at least donate that to charity or something....

Just wondering, what month did you order it?

Is it really too late to invest in bitcoin mining?
