Maybe one day his lost coin will be worth $100k

Yeah, I know right... really looking forward to that decentralised lightning network!

I'll take a 64gb iPhone 6 please mate. Chat soon. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:43:38
Yep. It's a sure thing, you've read the OPs post right? Heh
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:27:22
Never used it before but came here to say this.

I think I had 0 chance of working that one out. If they get harder then I'm pretty sure this game is not for me, haha.
@_date: 2016-01-02 00:32:52
There is that.

Now, after reading that, I feel a bit daft. I can't believe I didn't think of googling something similar. I instead looked into what Mr. Huygens had pioneered thinking there was some sort of algorithm he had invented or something, ha.
Next time my head will be in the game... I hope.

I wish it was available in places other than the US.

The idea is to buy small amounts of Bitcoin each day and increasing the amount you buy each day.
You could do it at $1 a day all the way up to $365 if you wanted to accumulate considerably more. It could be altered to fit.

Right so I assume you do this if the Core software has a bug right? Not try and submit a fix, just whine about it. Cool.
@_date: 2016-01-01 23:57:43
As it shows in the picture, you increase the amount you buy by $0.01 each day.

I'm excited to see how many are left. Best of luck!

I always forget that people aren't aware that free banking is just everywhere in the UK.
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:51:56
Here you go mate
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:12:18
Make it rain
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:18:30
Looks like Quidco?
@_date: 2015-07-11 10:24:56
Quidco don't offer the Bitcoin payout unfortunately :(

I helped tigertimbo get his BCH from his Coinbase Vault. It is true that he had funds in his vault at the time of the fork and that they did not appear in his account.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:28:05
I think it was a joke mate. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:32:45
The game.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:15:29
'The' game...
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:11:16
Balls deep... Brilliant :')
