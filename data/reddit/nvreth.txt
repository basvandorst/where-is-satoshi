tl;dr a valid chain is a series of subjective points that can be debated thoroughly for the rest of eternity.
I'm afraid you need simpler terms. As long as the chain is a fork of Bitcoin, then it has every right to become "Bitcoin" by gaining the most hash power - an *extremely* difficult task.
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:38:53
I am certainly not a big blocker, I will just back what is reasonable and fair. Please delete elaborate on how it works; I'm willing to learn.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:13:00
Bitcoin can run (admittedly nowhere near as securely) with very few nodes. Bcore cannot run with very few hashes per second.
It's also very easy to spin up some nodes to support Bitcoin if it needs them. Not nearly as easy to spin up some high powered mining rigs.
You know this already dude.

@_date: 2017-08-11 06:42:26
Absolutely, when I say the main chain I do mean majority hash power. So in November Bcore (the current main chain) will not destroy the main chain (2x hard fork)
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:37:18
The reality is that no, you couldn't. Miners will move their hash power to chains that are validated by lots of nodes (security) and used by lots of users/businesses (strong outlook).
Hash power is a great measure, and anything else is often conjured up to align with personal agendas/political stance. I've seen incredible mental gymnastics by people determining what "bitcoin" is. Bcash is Bitcoin because X, and Bcore will be Bitcoin because Y. I'm afraid - in simple terms - it all comes down to the hashing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:37:29


By your logic, I can fork Bitcoin, drop difficulty and run 10 second block times, validate it with a dozen nodes and I'll have the longest valid chain. That's not how you "measure" what is and isn't Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the fork with the most hash power. Plain and simple.
It's almost as if you forgot that Bitcoin forked several times before. For you, the only "true Bitcoin" should be the original chain which was forked away from nearly a decade ago, and whose functioning coin has a total value of $0.00.

BCH has altered the political landscape in the sense that forks will not destroy the main chain.
Unity in bitcoin is not about convincing others to join you, but simply shedding them through hard forks. Each iteration sheds another radical faction.

Centralized decision making is important for human progress in general, as has been proven in history time and again. Hopefully we can decentralize decision making eventually, but I'm afraid we're not at that point - and if Bitcoin wants to wait until the tech is there, then prepare to be usurped.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:45:43


Sorry, yes you're right. I was referring to 3rd party software as opposed to downloaded wallets. Most Bitcoin related software is cloud based, and the operators will update to run the main chain.
Those with downloaded software are generally more tech savvy and would know what to do; those in Coinbase-esque platforms (the vast majority) will not have to do anything.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:08:14
It has larger blocks and an ethos of "onchain scaling". Which is polar opposite to Bitcoin which very much wants to minimize onchain scaling for a number of reasons - not least that the blockchain could become many orders of magnitude larger (in gb), alienating miners and nodes and leading to centraliszation.
BCH and Bitcoin represent two different factions with very different ideals about how best to scale a blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:44:33

"Have their cake and eat it" is basically the correct response. Developers can be socially inept and often struggle to reach compromise particularly on emotional values - such as honoring an agreement. SegWit2x was a result of business leaders (with social acumen) capable of seeing each others' side and reaching compromise. Core supporters want to shit all over that idea and pigheadedly chase a single goal regardless of other perepectives. I'm sure that such a policy can only be doomed for failure.

That's totally fine, if people want BCH^1 go for it. You can't beat market forces. The most hash power will always be bitcoin, and I'm afraid that SegWit2x will have the most hash power. By all means fork off if you like. It is well within your rights to make a fork of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:56:36
is commenting very slyly.
90% of miner support is for the 2x hard fork, so that will remain as "bitcoin". Bcore or Bitcoin Core will be an alt coin, which will not be compatible with software that doesn't update to 2x.
Because of the overwhelming miner/business support for 2x, your software will (likely) update to the hard forked chain automatically. Bcore users will need to ensure they use the Bcore chain.

@_date: 2017-08-21 10:03:33
Appreciate the answer, and I fully agree with your points. We are all in a sub-optimal position.


This sums up the problem. Negotiations, meetings, podcasts, interviews, everything was done to try and reach agreement (for nearly 3 years this debate has gone on). Unfortunately an agreement was not reached, and by definition there will be unhappy parties - no matter what direction a proposal takes.
However, Bitcoin (quite counter-intuitively) does not care for consensus in this respect. If it can achieve consensus with a smaller subset of users then that is equally OK (at the sacrifice - hopefully short term - of security). Let's say S2X breaks off in November and the community is cut in half; the half that move to S2X will get consensus on their chain. Anyone else is welcome to validate the chain they choose; 1x, 2x, 8x.
I find it all fascinating, and I'm excited/apprehensive to see how things play out over the next few months.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:03:48
Some miners are shifting to BCH because they are opportunistic and it is profitable to do so.

Well said, but if you have 1BTC on Coinbase then as it stands you're missing out on an extra $300 (price of 1BCH right now). If you move your 1BTC to a wallet like Airbitz then you can claim your 1BCH post hard fork.

I think we've seen from BCH that hard forks aren't the horror story that so many believed.
SegWit2x will happen, and Bcore will be able to spread their wings while Bitcoin continues on its own critical development path. A huge boon for the Bitcoin community who can finally shed some of the toxicity brought on by the 1mb and 8mb partinsanship.
Also 4mb blocks are misleading. Many many transactions will not use SegWit for some time. Normal transactions will continue to fill blocks in a sub-optimal (but totally fine) way.

Fair enough, although worth saying that decision making (at least in any decent timeframe) does require some centralisation. I am not a fan of Silbert or others, but this - combined with the perceived threat from a UASF - has made shit happen.
Look at what Ethereum has achieved with centralised decision making. It's very impressive. And I know from listening to VB that there are longer run plans to decentralise leadership, it is just not viable in the early stages.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:01:49
Thanks, just read through the whitepaper again as I thought I may have missed something.
I'm afraid the "longest chain" discussion is around chain splits when blocks are mined at the same time, leading to competing forks. Helping nodes to determine which fork to follow only requires a quick glance at the longest chain.
Given that blocks are mined on avg every 10 mins, BCH and BTC chain lengths are likely to be the same for the foreseeable future. Determining either as 'bitcoin' based on the longer one (again, they are the same length) would be - to put it politely - silly.
Edit: I guess I took your bait; reading your comment again it looks like your comments are politically motivated. Perhaps unhappy with the outlook for BCH's ability to become "Bitcoin"?

Because the Bitcoin block size will inevitably need increasing at some point in the future. This (combined with SegWit) is enough to provide a long runway for growth until other tech can help alleviate network pressure.
Those who are anti-establishment complain that this is a "corp coin". Those on the other side see this as "dev coin". The reality is that SegWit2x is very much in the middle. Sadly, the more technical side (myself included) is somewhat inept on the commercial aspect, and often hostile towards corporations for no reason other than because they are corporations.

@_date: 2017-10-11 22:35:13
It's foolish to guess what's right rather than looking at the evidence. A source on your &lt;90% hash power would be nice...
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:38:02
Ooh yes we are ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:22:12
LocalBitcoins.com has no official statement. No mention anywhere on their site either:
This article is the only "source" which has no actual source from LocalBitcoins.com (just pure speculation based on their BCH decision). 
I never bothered looking into it properly (as it always appeared to be cultist BS). Now that I have, it's clear you're all full of shit about the state of play.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:45:44
I saw Samson Mow (Blockstream) write a Tweet saying something to the effect of: "PSA: Exchanges will be adopting the ticker S2X and not BTC at the hard fork".
He rightly deleted it shortly after. Bitcoin.org clearly lacking a moral compass.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:25:33
You crypto-anarchists sure do like politics
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:01:04
Woe is me :(
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:58:08
Why doesn't signalling mean anything? Sorry if this sounds facetious, but I'm not following the rationale.
"Then there was the other 5%" is a reference to the signalling right?
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:55:05
If BTC was tanking this thread would be filled with "BTFD".
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:30:14
Do you have a source of those who claimed they were ready and don't yet have it implemented?
Like a real source, one which says something to the tune of "we are ready to implement SegWit the moment it goes live".
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:06:20
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:56:21
IIRC BCH didn't have 95% miner signalling. I believe it may be you that is suffering from dissonance.
Look at coin.dance; Slushpool is the ViaBTC of Bitcoin Core. We all know what happened here... is Core ready with their EDA?
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:17:34
Scale is important lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:23:41
What a nice dude you are.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:41:45
Dude, those scenarios cannot succeed, so they're irrelevant. It's funny that you trust some devs over others. Be interested to know why exactly? Outside of conspiracy theories and general superstition.
This is a 1mb to 2mb increase. It's no more complex than that. No change to how governance works, no change to the consensus algorithm. 1mb to 2mb.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:43:13
I'm speechless that Bitcoin.org wrote this. People and power.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:11:42
I'm not sure how you got 15-20% when 95% are actively signalling S2X? Are there miners signalling S2X but said they'll do otherwise?
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:40:25
"whatever". Solid counter. Think for yourselves for fucks sake
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:50:13
"Huge opposition" = a swathe of anonymous users on Twitter and Reddit.
Those who have *put their name* to 2X is a much larger list than those who have *put their name* to 1X. Those in favor of 2X also have the most to lose from a BTC failure (Coinbase, BitPay et al). Those in favor of 1X have very little to lose; (Mr Anonymous A, Mr Anonymous B, ... Mr Anonymous N^100).
When you rationalize what's going on, there's a definite weighting towards conspiracy nuts and idealistic anarchists on 1X and reasonable commercial interests on 2X. You canny argue with that.
0.25 BT2 futures on Bitfinex is simply delicious.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:37:22


Because Bitcoin.org is unable to write a balanced article; I'd like to let everyone know that should miner support stay at 90-95% on the S2X fork, it is likely that a single block will take several hours to be mined. Note that if your transaction requires 7 confirmations, it will take *at least* several days assuming no mempool backlog.
The only way for this to be resolved is if miners renege on their current signalling to S2X. It is up to you to decide on the chance of this happening.
Anyway, I'm off to Bitfinex for some more $1000 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:07:20
Futures markets with low volume on a single exchange are not "very accurate". That is jibberish.
It's also great news, because the shitty price discovery means Bitcoin is selling for $1000.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:19:31
Bitfinex - will decide after the fork
Bitstamp - no official comment yet
Kraken - no official comment yet
Coinfloor (largest UK ex) - "Bitcoin (aka. Bitcoin SegWit2x, SegWit, UASF, Core, etc.) will remain in consensus with the currently active Bitcoin network consensus rules."
Others; I'm not sure. But basically mate, you pulled that out your arse.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:51:05
Basically, everyone will decide after the fact. And with 1 block a day on Bitcoin Legacy, it's hard to imagine why they'd opt for that? Unless I missing something?
And apologies, didn't read OP's post properly and assumed you just meant anti-S2X.

He's definitely an ass, but I got a tiny bit more respect for him after watching his interview on Joe Rogan. Worth checking out just to see a slightly more candid side to him.
That said, he's full of shit about how much money he makes in poker.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:14:42


Banking in itself is a wonderful technology. Humans killed it. So while I agree with all your sentiments, I really feel like we should be working toward sovereign and transparent banking, not the wholesale end of banking.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:06:45
No such thing as approving or disapproving BCH. If you have a bitcoin private key with a bitcoin 'balance' then you have an equal amount of BCH after the fork. If you don't have the private key (i.e. you store your coins on Kraken or Coinbase etc), then it is entirely at their discretion as to whether you can access BCH.
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:25:22
Right; so you're saying that these guys "turned off" their network spam once they got SegWit2x agreed. 
Wouldn't it have been easier to just keep running the "illusion" until SegWit2x actually was activated so as to not arouse suspicion. Or is there another conspiracy theory which would support turning off the spam early?
Please reflect on what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:21:16
Last I checked about $250. Google Bitcoin Cash futures ViaBTC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:08:39
Just to add further clarity; Luke JR's comment clearly implies that no exchanges will accept BCH (patently false)
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:15:10
Roger Ver; putting "it" into BCH.
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:41:30
Hey guys, hijacking top comment for more price predictions.
Can anyone tell me what the price of Bitcoin will be on March 14th 2018; it's my sister's birthday and I was hoping to buy her a present but I need to know what the price will be to know whether I can afford it.
Thanks in advance!
^Fuck ^me ^^I ^^^needed ^^^^an ^^^^^/s

BCH -&gt; Bitcoin Cash
BCC has been used already for BitConnect (which seems to be benefiting from the confusion). Creators seem to have failed at some basic due diligence there.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:11:10
You're assuming demand for BCH transactions will require &gt; 2mb (or even 1mb). BCH transaction speeds and "clearing" will be no different to BTC. It's a red herring for investors.
If we're going to compare theoretical scenarios, then let's look at throughput with a Lightning Network enabled blockchain.
Edit: not going to rewrite my whole comment, but your comment is totally accurate in relation to throughput. I'm just calling out people that use this capacity increase as a 'boon' for BCH when in reality it's irrelevant.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:54:11
He's making a public and political play. That's obvious, no?
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:31:32
Is there anyway we can get Craig Wright in as CEO of OneCoin?
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:13:37
Absolutely agree, I think case in point for Ethereum Classic, which is confused with Ethereum by new investors on a *regular basis*.
I'm sure if it was announced that Ethereum Classic was to be renamed to Eclassic there'd be a 50% drop in price.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:26:01
Dumping BCH is unethical now?
There is no conflict of interest between Vorhees and BCH. As an individual, Vorhees can do what he likes. Roger calling him out like that is childish, inappropriate and irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:02:34
Some people will literally set fire to paper money for fun; consider it the same thing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:19:50
You're joking right? Oh shit, this is going to be a cluster fuck of the nth degree. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:21:06
He's a narcissist. It's plain as day. The worst type of leader anyone could ask for.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:10:57
Stopped reading at:


I'm sorry but where in BCH is there a change to blocktimes? If they're referring to 8mb capacity then it'll be terribly sad when avg block size is &lt;500mb
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:12:36


I smiled for the entire length of your post. Good on ya.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:59:13
I know; what I am hinting at is that this type of heavy-handed government oversight is an even stronger reason to detach from "the system". i.e. this should push buying, not selling
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:10:48
Ok, so can someone explain why this news is sending the price of Bitcoin *down*?
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:22:10
Wasn't it Jon Matonis who was convinced CW was Satoshi? Jeez, awkward.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:51:16
The key here is oversight. Fiat on blockchain gives oversight down to a granular level. If you can fully digitize cash you can do all kinds of integrations with other tech, not least machine learning.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:03:36
You're assuming many things about their holdings...
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:00:04
This comment is going to look hilarious in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:54:04
Really up to you; this is not advice!
There is a chance that people don't know that they will have coins on both blockchains, and many will panic sell before August 1st thinking the world is ending.
Personally, I'm going to wait to see what transpires after the chain splits. Possibly even buying if there's a dramatic drop in the run up to August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:21:47
Bitcoin blockchain is copied and pasted, miners start mining that chain and users start using it.
Anyone can fork Bitcoin (copy and paste), but if you or I were to fork it today, you can bet that zero people would use it and its value would also be zero.
The fork is happening to help implement some contentious scaling solutions that cannot be agreed upon by the community.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:20:36
When Bitcoin forks you'll own the same amount of coins on both chains.
No one knows what will happen then. Perhaps both coins will rise, both coins will fall, or each will go an opposite way.
Whether you choose to sell or buy BTC or BTC(1) is up to you and what your outlook is on each coin.
If the fork happens, plenty of guides will be launched on interacting with BTC(1). 
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:42:42
That he owns ETC? 
No source for him wanting to dismantle Bitcoin. That's just unfounded speculation.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:13:12
Give it a few days until people realize this news makes Bitcoin and cryptoassets *more* valuable. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:11:53
This is why in 50 years we'll vote in a government that has this level of transparency in its manifesto. The public will know enough about crypto to back that government.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:22:36
Let's talk about Ethereum shall we? A lot of people lost a lot of potential earnings by dumping ETC on day 0. And others lost even more dumping ETH.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:34:05
This needs to be higher - Ethereum is where Bitcoin was several years ago. The key difference is that Ethereum has a roadmap for scaling and the community is vastly more coordinated than Bitcoin.
I'm afraid Bitcoin's key selling point is its critical mass. That selling point is about 2 weeks from being usurped.
