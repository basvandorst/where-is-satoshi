Owh, this looks really good! Will it support new cryptocurrencies like @_date: 2014-03-10 03:09:47
The same always happens to me and I get a shock, log in to my Coinbase and am happy again.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:08:24
If you have an iPhone with Google Authenticator you'd just login again on your apple account and have all your apps + settings back or am i crazy?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:59:35
Awesome, supporting bitcoin AND blackcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:33:07
Mind you, this is still in beta. Functionality and user friendlyness will improve over the next few versions. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:35:31
There will be a time when we go to a stripclub we pay for 100 singles with BTC and spent them all on making it rain. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:54:39
i lolled at that.

Is that really Faye Reagan on there?
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:12:28
If proven true this would be an awesome move from Best Buy. Brick and wall stores like that will have to do something special to overcome the internet age.

If this is your conclusion after reading these screenshots you have not read them properly. SDC stayed out of the Blocknet after learning these details.

It's Coinbase moving it for him to their cold storage.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:16:43
My Question:
If these transactions went through, did anyone receive any of their coins?
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:42:30
On the other hand, we see movement in the Blockchain and the Gox's API shows movement too. Something is happening at Gox.

You can test the BlackHalo version now, it works perfectly from my experience - download it at

They copied my Facebook message for their headline...
Will the real Nakamoto please stand up?!

For the downvoters: You can say what you will of the altcoin community, but they do also push the frontiers of digital currencies. Have some love, as innovations in altcoins might actually help bitcoin move forward too.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:32:54
This exists and it called  Also check out the  version which runs quite a bit faster due to the differences in transaction speeds.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:26:20
Yeah.. it's not like those unsold GHs's aren't running either way?
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:15:31
Hmm, they shouldn't even make you able to BUY them without 2FA activated on your account.

@_date: 2014-04-16 15:48:16
Well, Coinkite is pretty speedy thanks to their zero conf system. I read the rumor myself somewhere on bitcointalk, seems to originate from the Toronto expo
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:00:56
Thanks for both the tip and the sharing :)

@_date: 2013-05-17 16:39:42
It's actually the most read article for the tech section of the biggest news site in the Netherlands. Great exposure for Bitcoin once again!
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:29:57
For 10000 BTC i'll retro fit a whole plane as a Pizza bakery and start a one year tour around the world.

2FA also works with text messages for most services. IP filter is not available on Bitstamp right now.

41 EUR profit btw. 
Considering time:
It'll take a total of maybe 20 minutes to perform all the actions describe, if that. Sending money to BTC-E - Doing the Transfers - Selling the money on Bitstamp.

Or something like kink.com which is a portal for many other kinky niches basicly.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:04:06
The castle company is Kink.com :). They have bought the San Francisco Armory which is the castle you talk about ;)

***Do it.***
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:07:50
Nice! And with current marketprices their Bitcoin offer is about half as cheap as the CC offer!
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:10:03
Well, start it off i'd say :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:38:29
Yeah i like these guys, they give good explanations, but i'm more looking in the form of an animation much like the one weusecoins.com uses. However that one seems outdated by now.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:36:13
coinSMITHS gonna be awesome :)!
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:49:09
Looks pretty awesome :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 11:12:15
This could also mean their other company's in Belgium and Germany will also be adding Bitcoin support relatively soon. Which is even more awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:31:37
And now i have set it up i'm like 'And why didn't i do this sooner? It's so easy?'. FML.

Quick n dirty translation of the article:
Users from thuisbezorgd.nl will be able to use bitcoins to order food at one of the 5000 restaurants that are connected to the service starting this tuesday. It's one of the first big services in the Netherlands that accepts Bitcoins as a way to pay.
Thuisbezorgd.nl has added the support for Bitcoin mainly to offer their users more choice in payment. The site does not know how popular the addition of Bitcoin will be, but Imad Qutob, the marketing manager from Thuisbezorgd expects iDeal to stay the most popular payment method. "We don't expect that Bitcoin will directly have 10% of our number of payments".
"We believe that several parties can grow big with online payments" he says. "In 2009 we added Paypal support and back then Paypal wasn't as big as it was now". About the popularity of Bitcoin in The Netherlands he adds: "It's hard to say how many people are using Bitcoins in the Netherlands, it's a chicken-egg story: If you can't pay with Bitcoins anywhere, the popularity will not grow as much"
The support for Bitcoins however is a big push for the online currency in the Netherlands. Thuisbezorgd.nl has (according to Twinkle100) in revenues the ninth spot in the Netherlands and about half the payments on the service are payed online.

Not often i just receive 15$ in my mailbox. Thanks Ripple. Now die.
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:14:20
Think in profit margins. Works perfect for me. I lost bitcoins too (just recently got hacked :() but now i've stopped my 'hold' thought and started daytrading. 
If you realize your yearly profit margin on your savings account at a bank is maybe 1-3% and you can make that daily with maybe ten minutes of work... Yeah that makes it worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:13:58
Just check graphs on BitcoinWisdom, Bitcoinity, the Orderbook from Bitstamp themselves and check the general consensus for the day on I just calculate my minimum low I need to reach to buy in and wait for that to happen, same for the minimum high. Sometimes you are wrong and it rises faster then expected but so far i'm 9 out of 10. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:47:35
I've received the same message 58 times when I print screened this. In the meantime there have been an additional 40 e-mails of the same transaction...

So. What this is saying, price wise, we are at Dec 04 of the Facebook chart?
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:01:15
I think the whole point of going to Kickstarter instead of using an BTC based IPO thing is more attention from users that do not use Bitcoin yet. If this get's popular enough on Kickstarter then alot of new users will flock to Bitcoin which is probably also one of the goals these two guys set.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:28:45
Yep, going through the whole lastpass thing. I got so many account O.o
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:44:53
I am having (kind of) the same experience. For the past months i have been posted Bitcoin links and experiences to my Facebook wall. Since this last week i've had more then 8 chats with people I normally don't regularly speak. People that normally have no interest in technology in 'that way' that want to now how to get them, how to have them secure etc. etc.
I think we really are nearing some kind of 'critical' point. Just make securing your coins a bit easier then it is now and BTC will flourish.
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:46:39
I am very fortunate it happened right now. I've taken major steps in securing my online identity now. It was a 150 euro (the amount i put in) lesson which sucks balls but needed to be learn. I'll get it back some how.

Of course, if there wouldn't be demand for porn no new porn would be made. Also, most webcam sites are hugely popular.

I find this statement funny:
It is unlikely that Bitcoin will ever prove to be a trustworthy alternative to national currencies like the dollar or euro because no government will guarantee it.
If enough people use it the governments won't have any choice but to support it.

Well, the goal hasn't changed, first page. Only the last post was wrong in the amount of votes needed for that. Thus the new submission.

I don't consider myself a noob around computers, however I never got into the whole security thing. This is a nice reminder why I should've done it earlier.

Oeh, nice option. 3 Euro's for a card isn't all that bad, just leaving out the normal birthday card would mostly cover those costs.
