Bet you don't have one of our fancy Bitcoin Black Swans - 
I won't just ship it to you free, I'll hand deliver it to you in the city!  Give it a go!

Oh - really quick, what appeals to you more - the magnets in the hands or in the eyes?

Hey - tried drilling out the holes to allow for the magnets I have and it went poorly.  I can either redesign them to have bigger hand holes (which will be cleaner than any drill job I can do) or just scale up the guys so the holes stay in the same proportion.  Thoughts?

Thank you very much!  We do too!

The moon men as designed wouldn't do well with suction cups, unless I could find real tiny ones.  I think a couple very small drops of rubber cement might work to hold it but it might look a little blotchy.  There's also some clear acrylic glue that is bomb at holding acrylic to acrylic.  It might hold to glass pretty well or it might hold to glass pretty well forever, so let me experiment a little before fully endorsing that.
I've done some work with magnets on both the bitflakes and the moon men and suspect I could secure a couple high-powered magnets in the hand holes.  I won't be able to tinker with this until tomorrow, however.

Buy some holiday decorations like our cute little Holiday Bitflakes from us!  Hell, I'll hand-deliver them to you anywhere in Manhattan!

At [Cruithne Traders]( we haven't converted any of our BTC to fiat as we would rather not do so for as long as we can.  We see Bitcoin as generally deflating over the medium/long term and so it doesn't make sense to readily convert an appreciating asset to one that is effectively depreciating.
As far as volatility goes, we would certainly rather it not happen but at such a low market cap and with so many other variables out there, small nudges are going to have a disproportionate impact.  Over time, we hope this changes for the better, bringing more stability to the currency, however right now we are still pretty positive on the whole idea.

Can do!
