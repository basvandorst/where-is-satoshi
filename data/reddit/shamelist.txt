They have a very interesting person as a Vice President responsible for mining.

I think they have closed the shop in mid 2017. Their CEO was Kiril Gantchev maybe you can hit him up on social media. Other than that I'd say coins are gone.

Cloud mining is a way to earn money on people that can't math.

I guess bitcoind (or qt for that matter) will let you run something like "listaddressgroupings" on a non-synced node, so you won't have to download the whole blockchain.

It's not a direct merchant integration, though. The article says about chrome browser extension which is currently in beta, so I don't really get it how it works.

If all or a large portion of miners leave the network (which is a low probability event given that bitcoin mining is pretty diversified) that blocks will be found proportionally slower, to a complete halt in the extreme event of majority of miners leaving, for example if mining becomes very unprofitable due to a large price decrease. Bitcoin has 2016 blocks difficulty retarget window, which will mean that for difficulty to readjust it may require that some miners mine at a loss to keep network moving. In some shitcoins that use mining algorithms available on a hash rental service (e.g. nicehash) and long diff readjust windows blockchain can become stuck for days after big spike and subsequent retrace of mining hash power, I doubt though that it can happen in bitcoin, but such probability exists.

Current US admin or wise, pick one.

It does not look like liquidation, because then price would go up, not down. 
My guess would be it is some in-house trading position that was funded by tether, that they wanted to close, and very "conveniently" the price dropped a lot to be able to close it.
