It's the most modern futuristic thing in the world printed on the oldest most outdated thing in the world.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:03:00
�� So true. Bears gonna bear.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:22:33
It should say "1 Bitcoin buys - $Lambo"
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:13:58
Awesome reply by her. Hopefully he sees this.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:57:01
Trumps actual voter base supports Bitcoin! This agenda is to support bank buddies
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:50:12
Was it schiff?
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:12:31
I think it's important for money to control itself because humans always eff it up.
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:13:54
This guy gets it. ��

I would think Bitcoin would go down in the short term since it's sometimes used as a hedge against the market.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:37:18
This is true! haha
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:05:07
Thin pieces of flimsy paper are no match for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:15:12
Yes, this morning.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:23:37
I'm no chart expert, but this is more than likely 100% accurate.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:49:31
In this video at 1:20 he clearly says he doesn't think nefarious activities have been done with cash which is laughable.
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:42:09
Not nefarious enough for Mr Mnuchin
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:48:03
There's been so many ups/downs since 2017 that I'm starting to become numb to them.
Hodl on.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:05:43
Correct ����

JP Morgan just announced their crypto is backed by cocaine.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:15:08
They didn't obtain user accounts from coinbase. It was Capitol One.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:39:29
It IS doing something. It's holding its value. 
I like the bomb suit tho. Ready for the next explosion.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:12:57
"WTF" moment of the day.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:36:32
Bitcoin is now officially a bubble.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:41:12
A lot of people don't know Satoshi Nakamoto first designed Bitcoin to help tent the un-tented.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:43:36
I think any time people compare Bitcoin charts to gold charta they should look at gold charts from 2990 BC when gold was used by humans for only ~10 years.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:46:34
I only buy fair trade, non blood, free range Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:02:09
Yeah totally, they'd never believe Trump was president.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:36:12
Wow. Ridiculousness.
@_date: 2019-07-18 05:25:12
There's no person under 85 that appreciates yellow metal so once that generation is gone something more modern and functional will take its place aka Bitcoin. Just a matter of time.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:21:22
If she still marries you after this stunt you should HODL her.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:08:45
Gold had a good run.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:10:31
If nefarious activity isn't done "all the time" with cash, then what are they "fighting every day".?! What a clown.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:46:57
Trump will be gone soon. Bitcoin will be for ever. Easy choice!
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:44:44
Well put.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:24:53
In this example the US dollar persona should have a uni-brow and weigh 700lbs.
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:30:41
Haha. I don't have enough GPUs.
@_date: 2019-11-23 17:22:24
Most relaxing meme ever.
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:15:33
She had blocks like a truck, truck, truck
Transactions like what, what, what
Decentralize your butt, butt, butt
I think I'll sing it again
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:28:16
When people make their money with Bitcoin... They'll  be spending a lot of that moon money at Amazon. I would buy both.

Bitcoin is up 92% in the last 3 months. Not exactly down.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:27:39
Andrew Yang. I like him but more than anything I'm supporting the fact we can donate in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:05:56
You pay for streets, electricity and many other things we all share that make society better. Why draw the line at Healthcare. Becauase the big farma want you to? I don't think helping each other is a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:22:14
Wasn't fake it was a question by me I thought it was the first candidate to do so.
Either way glad somebody is accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:51:40
Who said this is the top of a run? Only a small percentage of people are invested. And there's 17 million coins in circulation.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:53:07
I think dash has been a pretty established project for a long time.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:55:00
SEC doesn't regulate Bitcoin. Nuff said.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:07:22
Exactly ����
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:54:28
Great video!
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:08:21
You mention Healthcare, minimum wage and gun control as if they're bad things?
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:55:42
Removing shit coins would only increase Bitcoins price.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:52:39
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:54:00
 Bitcoin has come a long way. And it's just getting started.
