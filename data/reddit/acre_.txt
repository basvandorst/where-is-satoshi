If. You. Use. The. Wallet. App
We're talking about wallet apps.
Obviously paper wallets don't need the internet, and the way blockchains work, yes, you don't need the internet to be sent funds. But you need the internet to manipulate funds.

Well thankfully, it's a free market so people can pick coins with cheaper fees, that do the same thing as Bcore.

You're being thick.
If you use the wallet app to check the balance, it needs to use the internet.

You know you don't really think of Poland as having their shit together.

The blockchain is a really long series of receipts that reference each other going back to the genisis block. Currently all the data is about that size.

Buying with cash is super convenient. Currently you have to send bank transfers and wire payments to get more than a hundred dollars worth of anything.

I don't think it's an income thing. If you want adoption, you need to make it easy to use. What's easier than putting in cash and getting bitcoin, ether, or litecoin? It's faster and cheaper for converting small or large amounts faster than waiting for a wire transfer to process. For people like me who invest or otherwise use the currencies, this is amazingly convenient. You can't really use Visa to buy a lot of crypto. Coinbase let's you purchase very small amounts per week in Canada. So we can use electronic money daily, but not to buy electronic money!
It's also marketed towards privacy conscious people. Currently to use an exchange requires making an account, sending your personal information in, and waiting for verification. The exchange can track all your transactions in their system, which can compromise privacy in coins that don't have a public blockchain like the Bitcoin blockchain.

Pay with your card / cash, get coin. No need to sign up for things and give away your information.

I'm not a GDAX user so I didn't know this. I was more intended to answer his question about how exchanges make money. The answer is usually fees somewhere for using their service.

You keep missing the world people.

Coinbase is a service that provides an easy way to purchase coins with fiat money at market price.
With GDAX, if you're buying, you're matching up with someone's selling order. The coins come from other exchange users. The exchange takes a fee on each fulfilled order.

It's really only this sub that pushes the bcash thing.

They do a weird double send with ether so you pay two tx fees before you even see your balance.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:59:10
It's really not that hard. Almost every payment system I've seen meant for commerce shows the market rate in fiat when you're paying anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:02:58
If you sent from something like an exchange like coinbase, they use large wallet that's contain all sorts of people's coins. When you make a withdrawal or send they just move the amounts.
I don't know of any wallet software that requires that info what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:43:56
You can send it to any bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin wallet.

Insert cash, deposit coin into address minus network and ATM fee. They have a decent website if you click the post.

It's actually super traceable, and the USD is used to fund crime everyday.
She might also just not give a shit and there's no point arguing with her.
