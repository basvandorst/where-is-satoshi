I gave you a recent example of how 10 million USD can tank the whole market substantially with lasting impact if done professionally.
You can easily market sell 10 million USD perpetuals on Bitmex / Bitflyer or CME cash settled futures without moving the spot price. But market selling 2500 actual Bitcoin into illiquid order books is a different ball game. This practice will be enabled for US based professionals now.
Of course a short seller has to buy back at some point, but if you know what you are doing you do it lower than where you sold (look at the price action since Feb 24th, lots of opportunity to do that). And that is the definition of a sophisticated short seller: He sells higher than he buys, makes money in the long run, and that money comes from somebody else aka the Hodlers.
And don't tell me 6% annual(!) interest is the game changer here (for the short seller as well as the Hodler). This is a daily fluctuation.

Obviously we won't know how much is used to short, but it is done:
BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince from [above article]( :
*"One of the benefits of rehypothecation, he explained, is that it allows intermediaries to reduce trading fees and* ***enable short selling***.
*“If you don’t have a market that goes both ways, you can’t find the* ***true price of an asset***. Rehypothecation is the major component enabling that,” he said."
Rehypothecation has no upper limits in this case as far as I can see, so it could be 2,000 Bitcoins or 20,000 Bitcoins. That all beside net neutral strategies.
Regarding "true price of an asset": The best thing for BlockFi's business model is if Bitcoin loses its strong upward trajectory, so that Hodlers consider earning 6% (or lower) interest p.a. as a good deal and deposit ever more Bitcoins, enabling ever more shorting. They have an incentive to hold their "true price" of Bitcoin as low as possible, with as much stagnancy as possible, just like Bullion Banks / Central Banks regarding Gold.
But they will be in for a rude awakening with Bitcoin. [This practice]( (make sure depositors will not get their Bitcoins out) will have to be considerably more restrictive to prevent "bank runs" and contagion between crypto lenders (even rumours will lead to a crunch of the whole industry), which will backfire. There is no lender of last resort for Bitcoin, and we will see a large enough price squeeze in time to start the process of contagion, leaving depositors holding the bag not participating in Bitcoin's upside. Depositors effectively swap a potentially heavily appreciating asset (Bitcoin) against a 6% (and declining) interest p.a. claim with 100% downside. BlockFi extracts fees from the whole process, baiting financially illiterate Hodlers in.

I will never understand how anyone hodling Bitcoins can be stupid enough to completely give away the control over their Bitcoins (read BlockFi's Terms of Service) for 6% p.a., which will be reduced by BlockFi in a few weeks/month because they admitted they lose money paying that rate (6% is a bait). This is not a Bond, 6% is a daily price fluctuation in Bitcoin!
Not to mention your Bitcoins will be rehypothecated (aka fractional reserve lent) and used to short the market.
According to this [article]( BlockFi lent crypto worth $25 million in the first 2 weeks in March alone. This sum will be rehypothecated at least 2-3 times (perhaps more), so $75 million (almost 20,000 Bitcoins) were thrown on the market (shorted) the last 2 weeks because of this practice. This could easily have suppressed the price 6%. So 1 year of interest payment is negated in 2 weeks due to shorting.

With 100% downside I mean literally losing your Bitcoins.

Bitcoin's double spending "problem". Wall Street can't pull their magic tricks without significant risks (e.g. Lehman-style credit event). See here: [
Basically all banking (where revenue comes from) is about interest rate arbitrage / lending long, borrowing short (capturing net interest differentials) and relying on a lender / dealer of last resort (Central Bank, DTCC etc.) to step in and bail them out if something goes wrong with this leech model.
The interest equivalent in commodities like oil or wheat is storage costs incl. risk free rates in comparison to Futures curves (Contango, Backwardation). In Gold / Silver you also have Bullion Banks (fractional reserve lending) etc.
You obviously can't do all that dealing with Bitcoin (no lender / dealer of last resort).

Look, lending and selling ACTUAL Bitcoins multiple times over, which rehypothecation is, is NOT comparable to derivative contracts. On the surface, yes (and it can go on for a while), dig deeper, no.
Eventually all rehypothecated Bitcoins simply don't exist to buy back in the market place for ANY market price in case of emergency (e.g. big short squeeze), whereas for every derivatives seller there is a buyer.
Rehypothecation is no problem for Gold, where Central Banks hold vast amounts of Gold to lend to Bullion Banks in case of short squeezes or bank runs, or the DTCC or Fed could step in in case of a run on rehypothecated Bonds or Stocks (delivery is not possible for those, though, afaik). But there is no lender of last resort for Bitcoins, most people don't understand this.
Another case: When someone buys rehypothecated Bitcoins from a short seller or a liquidity provider through an exchange, they don't hold actual Bitcoins, but claims on one Bitcoin together with potentially many other customers. When these buyers that think they have Bitcoins decide to withdraw from an exchange, the exchange has to deliver real Bitcoins, squeezing all shorts / borrowers to buy back for any market price.
So it is not enough that crypto lending firms try everything to prevent that THEIR depositors withdraw their Bitcoins, there are multiple points of failure which the lending firms have no control over, including unprecedented short squeezes, leading to possible chain reactions.
Regarding price suppression of crypto lending vs derivatives shorting: At the start of the process all rehypothecated Bitcoins sold increase the supply. If short sellers couldn't do this because they weren't legally allowed to in this way, then it suppresses price for the time being (till forced to close as a whole). Now you say that every big US trading firm has shell companies that can sell 10k Bitcoins on BitMEX or BFX for hedging or shorting etc., and I can't check that. Though I find it unlikely due to regulation and tax issues. CME Futures yes, but they are cash settled and need high margin. OTC perhaps. Oversea gambling platforms, idk.
If these firms could do it so far (selling in big numbers), then there is no major price suppression from BlockFi's launch, I guess.


Idk about "very liquid" OTC markets, but USD/USDT is extremely illiquid. BFX (the entrance and exit to Tether) has big withdrawal fees of 3% over 1 million USD, and the stable coins market never saw big redemptions as a whole.

The whole value proposition of Bitcoin is that it doesn't go "both ways", especially in the long run. And it is absolutely clear why. It's not a traditional investment, and anyone who doesn't understand this (imo the whole traditional finance / Wall Street guys and regulators) will be in for a rude awakening. "Taming Bitcoin", for sure.


Most shorting now is done through derivatives (except perhaps Bitfinex, which relates to Tether -&gt; you basically can't get USD out, and it is not usable for US based firms / professionals aka Wall Street) in a closed ecosystem (where gains/losses are denominated in Bitcoin). BitMEX and Bitflyer perpetuals are with huge distance the most used to short, and I argue most volume is done from "degenerate gamblers" fighting each other. There is no agenda behind them, except for rising Bitcoin prices in the long run (even BitMEX itself bets on it as I can see -&gt; insurance fund). Btw, all that explains amongst other things why the crypto universe has absolutely no correlation to traditional financial assets, or Fed decisions, or inflation numbers etc., and it will largely stay that way (interesting to see in the next recession).
The difference between derivatives shorting on e.g. BitMEX and actual Bitcoin shorting (through rehypothecation) by traditional financial parties or even net neutral strategies that involve Bitcoin lending is clear, I guess. And the agenda behind it, too.

 From their [ToS](  " We will lend, sell, pledge, **rehypothecate**, assign, invest, use,  commingle or otherwise dispose of funds and cryptocurrency assets to  counterparties"

They make the "delivery process" a pain in the ass in order to easily fractional reserve lend Bitcoins to short sellers (see BlockFi's Terms of Service -&gt; rehypothecation). They need to make it almost impossible to withdraw to prevent a "bank run" (like the former Goldsmiths / now Bullion Banks did with Gold which they fractionally reserve lent).
The "plan" is to tame Bitcoin by transforming it into an interest bearing asset that stays mostly constant in price (which requires constantly growing numbers of shorts to suppress price) and extract profits from it like leeches.
6% (and declining) upside p.a. for the depositor, but 100% downside (unlimited counterparty risks of multiple forms, no participation in Bitcoin price appreciation in short squeeze scenarios because borrowers can't deliver multiple lent Bitcoins). It's Wall Street's business model in action.
It worked with Gold. It won't work with Bitcoin.

I already wrote it in another BlockFi thread:
Your Bitcoin will be lent to shorters (in this case mostly US based sophisticated professional investors). These type of US investors had great difficulties doing that kind of shorting so far.
I guarantee you this will suppress the price of Bitcoin much more than lenders gain in annual interest.
Look at what happened at Feb 24th, 2500 Bitcoins were market sold and the price tanked &gt;10%, the market got suppressed till now. Compare that to tiny annual 6% gains. This downward manipulation practice will become much more common if this gains traction.
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:08:36
I see your point. Thinking about it deeper, in the end short sellers as a whole will eventually lose, even as individual smart/lucky short sellers make profits. Crypto lending won't have a lasting negative impact on the price of Bitcoin in the long run (probably Bitcoin will take care of it by spiking/short squeezing much more frequently and heavily, perhaps at some point tanking the whole lending industry).

BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince in [this article]( :
*"One of the benefits of rehypothecation, he explained, is that it allows intermediaries to reduce trading fees and* ***enable short selling***."
But, like you, I also can't wrap my head around how you can sell paper claims of Bitcoins on exchanges without the double-spending problem.
The only explanantion is that the term rehypothecation in this case means "BlockFi lends Bitcoin to an intermediary aka exchange (on-chain transaction), exchange lends THIS BITCOIN to a customer (on-chain transaction), customer sells on exchange".
This wouldn't be a problem (no multiplication, no claims, no double-spending, just re-lending step-by-step from one party to the next). Everything else would be worrisome, but after thinking deeper about it not likely.
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:44:51
No, it's not.
You have to risk-adjust possible returns (the 6% interest) not only for "absolute" credit or counterparty risks, but for price volatility of Bitcoin itself ("relative"). Especially if said return is adjustable to the downside (which BlockFi guaranteed it will) and not upside.
Look at Total Return JGB Futures over the last 25 - 30 years to see the effect. They were arguably the best risk-adjusted traditional investment ("straight line up" without major drawdowns), but had close to 0 or negative interest rate differential over that period (as a 10-year Bond!). Comparable Bonds like the 10-year Treasury Futures (Total Return) had much higher interest rate differential, but way worse risk adjusted returns. Would you buy USTs BECAUSE OF the interest (exchange rates aside), leverage allowed?
@_date: 2019-03-23 10:29:34
As soon as you deposit your Bitcoins they will be multiplied and sold into the market. You contribute to the suppression of Bitcoin's price, which will go on until a short squeeze or bank run hits, in which case you likely won't get your deposited Bitcoin + interest back (they either won't let you withdraw or can't deliver your Bitcoins). Lose lose.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:39:23
Yes, not only possible fractional reserve lending but also "increasing" Bitcoin's supply by "distributing" Hodler-coins to sophisticated shorters to the detriment of those Hodlers. WS business model in action.
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:46:58
From their [ToS]( " We will lend, sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of funds and cryptocurrency assets to counterparties".
Rehypothecation is pledging collateral multiple times. Common Wall Street practice. In this case it is fractional reserve lending AND selling, openly disclosed. It works with Stocks, Bonds, Gold etc. It won't work with Bitcoin.
Greedy BlockFi lends/sells your Bitcoins 10x over, making 60% annual interest gains.
This can go on for some time, until a big Bitcoin short squeeze and/or subsequent "bank run" tanks the whole crypto lending industry. Stupid hodlers who lent their Bitcoins for 6% p.a. will be screwed, as broke borrowers/lenders won't be able to deliver. All other Hodlers will profit handsomely in this gigantic short squeeze scenario.
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:25:59
Let's be clear here: They will lend your Bitcoins to shorters.
It is highly probable that the suppressing impact of the shorters on the price of Bitcoin will be much greater than the annual 6% you get for lending your Bitcoins (aside from additional counterparty risks). You and everyone else that is long Bitcoin will lose out.
Very bad choice imo.
