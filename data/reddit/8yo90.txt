Ver is not the one dividing the community. He helped start other communication channels because the main ones (this one included) set up explicit censorship policies for one of the biggest debates in the history of Bitcoin. And the Core devs have been unwilling to make any compromise at all with the majority of users who still hold the original vision of Bitcoin as articulated by Satoshi. That is what divides the community.
@_date: 2016-04-30 20:58:56
? This is untrue. I, too, lived through this split, and how you've described it is false. Advocating for the explicit vision of Satoshi is not an "attack" on the network or community. Whether other methods for scaling are superior is precisely the point of contention. And yes, Theymos was open about his censorship - but that didn't make it right. His censorship has been widely condemned by leaders throughout the bitcoin community, including some of the Core devs.


The exact same thing could be said of this subreddit. But more than anything, this could be said of the completely unfair, unnecessary, and uncalled for censorship policies of Theymos, which more than anything else led to the split in the community.

Well, at the time of this writing, the only USD exchange I am aware of that has a higher price is HitBTC (which is always way higher than everyone else).


Of course, but if they are giving you a higher rate than what they are getting it for (and what you could get yourself), then it is a hidden way for them to make money (while allowing them to still claim that they didn't charge anything that would normally be considered a fee). Thus, hidden fee.

Actually Gavin is going about this is exactly the right way, by appealing to the whole Bitcoin community. Bitcoin's code is simply what most people are using, not what most of the core developers say it is. Both this guy and the BitTorrent guy point to the fact that most core devs are against the change, and imply or say that this is contrary to how bitcoin is supposed to work. Yet there are not and never have been "official" keepers of the code, because it's open source and the code is whatever most people are using.

It's not a fork *yet*. It *could* lead to a protocol fork, if it gets enough hashing power behind it. If and only then would the protocol fork actually happen. Then it certainly would be a hard fork.
But even at the possible future date, being a protocol fork is just one part of the definition of an alt-coin, according to luke-jr. He says an altcoin is a protocol fork that *also* lacks the original economic consensus. In such a case, with a supermajority of the hashing power behind it, it seems likely to me that it would also bring with it an economic supermajority. In any case, luke-jr saying that XT is a protocol fork that lacks economic consensus is not true now (it's not yet a protocol fork) and not true in the future (since we don't know whether XT would get an economic consensus. Thus, this diagram is more about what luke-jr wishes would happen, and less a neutral explainer.

@_date: 2015-08-23 00:08:52
I didn't say 75% of hashing power makes an economic consensus, but that if xt gets that, it will most likely also get the economic consensus. Luke-jr saying that xt will fork the protocol without taking an economic consensus is just speculation about the future, and speculation that I think is unlikely.

It's because it has already been debated for years and the longer we wait and the more people/stakeholders Bitcoin has, the harder it will be to change anything.

Is this an advertisement or just a really short article?
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:13:06
What time period is this diagram showing exactly? If it's showing the present, it's wrong because xt hasn't forked anything. If it's showing the future after xt has gotten 75% hash and the protocol fork has kicked in, no one knows for sure whether an economic consensus will follow it or not (and I find it unlikely that an economic consensus wouldn't follow it). So is this simply what hopes/thinks will happen? In which case it's not a helpful "explainer".
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:16:51
But there have been no changes to the protocols in xt. What XT does have is code saying that it will in the future change the protocol *if* enough of the hashing power agrees to it (in which case, it's hard for me not to think an economic consensus will also follow XT, though it's impossible to predict the future). For the time being, XT runs the same protocols as Core. And if XT changes, it will only change under conditions that would make it more likely that Core - not XT - would meet your definition of an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:25:50
[REDACTED] is, at the moment, neither a hard fork nor an altcoin. [REDACTED] hasn't broken from the consensus protocol, and won't unless 75% of the hashing power is behind it, making it highly likely that, when/if it does make the protocol change, [REDACTED] will bring with it an economic consensus. In which case [REDACTED] would meet your definition of a true hard fork, and not an altcoin (Bitcoin Core would become the altcoin).
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:32:48
Even if that's the case for this diagram, we don't know if XT will bring with it an economic consensus or not, and thus it may or may not meet his definition of an alt-coin (and if XT did take the economic consensus, Core would become the altcoin). Thus, this is less about explaining forks/altcoins, and more about him projecting what he'd like XT to be.

@_date: 2015-08-20 02:02:22
Why exactly can a hard fork for Bitcoin not be legitimately proposed to Bitcoin users? The fact you seem to think it cannot is the crux of the matter, and shows you don't understand how Bitcoin works. The Bitcoin code is whatever code people are running, not what a handful of devs think it should be, or are proposing it should be at a certain place on GitHub. There is no reason anyone can't propose new code for Bitcoin and try to get people to use it. That it the only way Bitcoin ever improves.
Further, having a higher block size limit has always been the plan for Bitcoin. Those arguing that it shouldn't be raised significantly are the ones essentially proposing an altcoin (if anyone in this debate can be said to be doing that), not those proposing it should be raised.

It matters if people are arguing that a change to the block size limit is a fundamental change to bitcoin, when in fact the original founding vision clearly shows that it isn't, and that leaving it so low in fact would be a large departure from the Bitcoin status quo.
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:01:20
Satoshi isn't necessarily right about everything, of course, but it's relevant to cite him to determine what the original vision of Bitcoin was. In this case, the original vision shows that those claiming status quo (leave the block size limit at 1mb) are in fact arguing for a radically different kind of Bitcoin than the original vision that most everyone else "signed up for". 
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:51:20
It's relevant when one side of the debate keeps on painting a radical departure from the original vision we all signed up for as the status quo (permanently small blocks), and a proposal in line with the original vision as an altcoin (larger blocks).

Does not come close to it? The block size limit was placed as an after thought anti-spam measure, not to artificially limit the network to be a settlement network for some other system, and he explicitly said the limit could be changed. His explicit vision was for Bitcoin to be a p2p cash system itself, not to be a settlement layer for other systems. Now, might it make more sense for Bitcoin to be a settlement layer? Maybe, but that wasn't the original vision, it's not what the vast majority of users signed up for, the proposed alternative (eg LN) doesn't even exist yet, and we're being forced down this alternative path simply by obstruction, as well as censorship of discussion in the main community channels, rather than because the Bitcoin community has been convinced through open and fair debate that this is the way to go. Instead, we've had explicit censorship of the original vision of Bitcoin because those espousing the new vision saw they were losing the fair and open debate.
Re alternative implementations, yes, but that is a minor procedural point, not central to what Bitcoin is, and people are only trying to have alternative implementations precisely because the main one has decided that the original vision is no longer worth pursuing. Heck, Peter Todd recently said he even thinks the hard limit on the number of bitcoins is "wishful thinking." Why have these people decided to commandeer the Bitcoin project and make it into something else through obstruction and censorship, rather than simply start their own cryptocurrency with their new ideas and principles?
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:08:21


? This isn't even controversial. For one, Satoshi was crystal clear on what bitcoin was supposed to be (if it's not clear to you, I recommend checking out the *title* of his whitepaper) and how we would get there. Secondly, it was my understanding that most Core devs fully acknowledge this - they just disagree with Satoshi. Which is perfectly fine! But they've hardly tried to convince everyone else who already signed up for Satoshi's vision of their position, and have mostly used censorship and obstruction to turn bitcoin into something new. You might be able to understand why this is upsetting to people.
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:22:15


Except that this doesn't help your case. The debate right now is not whether bitcoin should be a P2P cash system alone, or a P2P cash system and a settlement network; Core and their supporters explicitly want bitcoin to *only* be a settlement network and *not* a P2P cash system (they make fun of this all the time about how people shouldn't pay for coffee on the blockchain).
By modestly increasing block size limit, on the other hand (the position of Classic of course), all possibilities can still be pursued. If second layer solutions end up working well and people gravitate towards them naturally and there's a consensus that we no longer need to keep increasing the block size limit - great! But Core is forcing this path on everyone, a path that was not the founding vision and that the vast majority of the community didn't sign up for.


I can't quickly link to anything immediately, but I've seen this in the discussion many times over the last year. And frankly, I don't see how anyone could possibly dispute what Satoshi's vision was, as he made it very clear.

No, I meant "yes this is the plan" as in the Core plan is for bitcoin to become only a settlement layer (I'm disagreeing with you). I agree that bitcoin can also be a settlement layer (I'm not aware of anyone who is against people building such systems); I don't agree that that new vision should be forced on bitcoin by a minority through censorship and obstruction.


lol Yeah, this is a great example of the problem, namely denial and rationalization. *The block size limit debate has been one of the most consequential debates for bitcoin, and it was shut down by censorship right in the middle of the debate.* Nearly all prominent people in the bitcoin space who aren't Core devs have condemned the censorship.
XT and Classic are not alts, and it's absurd to argue that they are. They seek, *in the only way possible for bitcoin* (namely, by trying to convince people to run new code), to alter the bitcoin protocol (a change that just so happens to have been *explicitly planned by Satoshi*). Theymos absurdly argued that they were alts because not all Core devs agreed with the change - as though they get to decide what code "officially" makes up bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:36:00


? Bitcoin has a (relatively speaking) very low transactional capacity. If the capacity remains low, it is not possible for bitcoin to function as a P2P cash system if the number bitcoin users continue to grow, but instead will only be able to work as a settlement network. Core devs explicitly say that they want bitcoin to be settlement network.


Um, thanks for the advice, but I've been involved with bitcoin for a long time and have followed this debate closely. You, on the other hand, don't seem to understand basic facts about the debate, or how bitcoin works. I recommend you go away, do some research, think for yourself, and don't just believe everything you read on Edit: So ironic that a Core supporter is asking me to do research and think for myself, when a Core supporter (theymos) has decided to abuse his position controlling the two main communication channels for the bitcoin community by censoring positions he disagrees with - and Core supporters either agree with him or remain silent. So much for caring about thinking for yourself!
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:31:44
Except that you are misunderstanding my argument. I'm not saying that we are required to follow Satoshi's vision. I'm saying that there was a founding vision, for which most users signed up. Core has a different vision. As I said earlier this discussion, that's fine! But rather than work to convince the community of this new vision, they've decided to try to force their new vision on the community through censorship and obstruction. Further, the Core devs are the one who are fostering this "leader mentality," by implying that they alone produce the "true" code for bitcoin, and that XT and Classic are "alts" as a result.
Here's what I support: increase the block size limit. Keep working on layer two scaling solutions. Let's actually try things in the wild and see (1) if they actually work and (2) see if people actually want them; and then go from there organically. Core, on the other hand, wants to impose a specific - and new - vision on the whole community.
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:47:22
Except that the lack of scaling will simply push people away from bitcoin (either away from crypto or to other crypto currencies). Since there are other options, bitcoin will probably never "fail"; it will probably just fade or stay where it is.

What do you mean by "takeover attempt"? Takeover from whom? No one is the leader of bitcoin. We're talking about what code people are running. No one has to run any set of code. The bitcoin network runs on consensus code, that's it. The only way to change this *is to convince people to start running different code - the very technique that Core and their supporters decry as unfair, because they view themselves as the de facto "leaders" of bitcoin.* The fact that people don't understand this basic fact is a major reason why this has been such an unnecessarily big fight in the bitcoin community.


? It's "classic" in the sense that it is pursuing *the explicit vision as put forth by Satoshi*, the vision for bitcoin that most people signed up for, the vision explicitly rejected by Core devs. And what about "Bitcoin Core"? Is it really the "core" of bitcoin? Of course not. It's just one (of several) implementations of the protocol. Between the two, the Bitcoin Core name is far more misleading.


No he didn't. He wrote blog posts defending his position. If you disagree, write a response. But Core didn't do that, and because the Core position started losing, theymos started shamefully censoring the most important communication channels for the community, and Core supporters let it happen. This, by the way, has probably been the single most destructive thing done to the bitcoin community in its existence - all at the hand of Core and their supporters.


? Gavin, *more than anyone else*, took this debate to the people. So he's guilty both of "back channel lobbying" *and* "rallying the masses"? And why the contempt for "the masses"? Gosh, the whole Core mindset is so elitist and smug, it's incredible. When you lose the majority (the *only* thing in bitcoin that sets the rules), you decry "the masses." Here's the deal: *Bitcoin is a community running code.* There are no "experts" in charge.
And of course Gavin has private conversations with people, both sides have (why would that not be allowed?). It's the Core side that has done hardly anything to try to actually convince the majority of people of their position; instead they have used censorship and bullying ("we're smart, so shut up!") - all antithetical to the principles and values of bitcoin and the community.


Lol. There are people who run large numbers of Core nodes. This doesn't really mean much. Who says you can't run more than one node?
The amazing thing about this whole debate is that Core and their supporters actually try to argue that big-blockists have somehow used unfair tactics, *when it is Core supporters that have misused their power over what at the time were basically the only communications channels for the bitcoin community to censor the opposing position*. Please stop crying about being a victim just because the majority disagreed with you.

You haven't actually responded to any of my points. Are you claiming that Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin was for it to be a relatively small settlement network?
And re the democracy of Bitcoin, actually it is a democracy, in a way. No one officially controls or makes decisions for bitcoin; rather, Bitcoin is the network and the code that people run. The fact that the Core devs seem to think they do run Bitcoin in some sense is one of the many problems we have right now. Hence the language of "attack" when people try to convince people to run non-Core code.
@_date: 2016-05-17 01:46:52

Exactly. This kind of response to the theymos' censorship is exactly the problem, and shows how unprincipled Core supporters are. This, more than anything else (including which way the block size limit debate goes) is the most damaging of the bitcoin community.
