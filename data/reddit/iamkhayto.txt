s2x can be sold on bitfinex since the first announcement of the fork. only thing is you have to keep ur coins there until the fork happens so they can take em once they out.

the only point of concern i have toward tether is this. is it created WHEN there is an equivalent supply of USD. or is it created out of thin air, used to buy bitcoin and jack up the price, than sell and than use that money to back the freshly created tether, generating a profit too in the process.
if it is backed by USD before its creation, i see no issue, aside from the terrifying disclaimers that pretty much tells you ''ur tether isnt worth shit and if we go down for ANY reason including any fraudulent activities from us, you go down with us'' 
if its not backed by usd when its created than its no different than central banking generating profit out of nothing.

when it crashes like that, its when theres money to be made, on smaller exchanges with wider spread, you can get series of trades sometimes within a 400$ spread. i usually make a minimum of 5% everytime it dips like that becasue it always go back up and down a few times after ward, ofc i dont throw in all my coins cause theres always the risk some guy is gonna drop 1k coins on finex and everyone gonna go crazy.

bitcoin is medium of exchange, it would of been stupid not to sell at that time, he probably bought back at 10-15$ maybe higher, and hes probably rich today, until he bailed after mtgox / silkroad ofc.

ever heard of a racetrack? they're all over the world and you can drive as fast as you can there ;) also, NA as some of the lowest speed limits in the world. lots of country still have 80mph+ highways.

how convenient for tether uhh, a ''hack'' exactly when people start realizing tether might not be backed by anything at the moment of creation, than used to pump, sell at a higher price, and than use that money to back the tethers that were just created while pocketing an illegitimate profit.
