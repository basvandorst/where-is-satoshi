Thanks to Republican megacorporate shills, there is no Fairness Doctrine.

The reason the Democratic one on the right is so high is because Obama added the cost of the Iraq wars to the official register.  Under Bush is was classified as an "Emergency Spending Measure".

Exactly.  He was all about the "free-markets" and no regulations.  Now he can use another vendor for "donations".

Just because you don't have kids doesn't mean you shouldn't lock up your gun.  If some teenager breaks in when you're away and steals your gun and kills someone, it's on your conscience.

Here we go!  Thanks for the new thread!

I believe it's known as KYC - Know Your Customer.
If they do due diligence, they can't be liable if you do something bad.

Bitcoin is new technology.  Who else would he go to, people who know nothing about it?

Are any of those transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars range?

Actually they do.  If it's a large *fiat/cash* transaction, they have to check their actual holdings to ensure they have it on hand.
It really depends on if the bank sees this as a _cash_ transaction.  It *should* be an electronic one between Chase and Coinbase, but I'm not privy to whom their payment processor is.

It could be related to the US auctioning off the bitcoin:

Basically, if all transactions are added to the global ledger, can it scale efficiently?

If they have proclivities for this behavior, putting them in a relatively controlled environment is better (relatively) than having them hidden among us.  If someone is good at hurting someone else, it's best to focus that energy and try to turn it into something useful rather than let it ravage society at random.

Such a thoughtful and generous fellow (or ma'am) you are!

This is called [Bus Factor 1](  Every organization should take a lesson from this.

How do you participate?
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:17:32
I'm in.

Thanks!  You're great!

No loss for them.  He was probably a liability for them due to nutjobs that believe his nonsense.
Thoughts and prayers.
