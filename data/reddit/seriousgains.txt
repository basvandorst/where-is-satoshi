The next industrial revolution is upon us, but the majority of people don't realize it because they don't comprehend the value of something that isn't readily tangible. The ability to adapt to technology will certainly become a survival instinct over the next century. As technology continues to improve on a parabolic curve, people who are unable or unwilling will become poor and ultimately die off.

You could have made your point without including the word "white" and no one would have to be threatened by it, as the "old" is subjective and could be in reference to old fashioned or old way of thinking. But there's no way around the statement you made being characterized as racist.
Now being that I'm white, and even though I don't associate myself with the rich/ruling class, I have to feel threatened by your remark. So even if I agree with the majority of your sentiment I have to be on guard as to give you my full support because you are at least somewhat motivated by a racial bias.

Theoretically the best time to buy bitcoin is right now. In actuality there may be a better moment in the future but that's no guarantee.

You risk selling your alts near the bottom in terms of price vs bitcoin if you sell now. If your goal is to have more bitcoin, I would suggest holding on to your alts until a more favorable time (see alt season) and continuing to DCA bitcoin.  If your goal is to have more fiat currency, then it's likely a good idea to sell your alts into bitcoin now so you can be prepared to sell back into fiat once bitcoin peaks.

This is false.
Dollar cost averaging BTC starting at the ATH was NOT more profitable than gold or stocks. If you do the math and extend this chart you'll find that you are near break even, not outperforming other assets.
If you stopped buying on June 18th 2019 (where the live data ends, BTC ~ $9.2k) and held you would be up 6.2% today. Your return would be considerably lower if you continued to buy as the price rose above 12k and subsequently fell back to today's prices.

@_date: 2019-06-26 17:15:26
Consistent DCA is what makes it easy to buy at prices like we're seeing today. 13k seems high right now but in a few months it could be an absolute bargain. If you bought low and just held you wouldn't be adding to your stash like DCA allows you to.

Alt coins were the hot topic this year. I guess BTC is considered old news now.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:07:26
Time to adjust your portfolio. Alt season is nearing.

It's "Ho-dor" not "Haw-dor". So why would HODL be any different.

That's Thor and Fenrir I presume.

My ex-girlfriend racked up 300k in student loans from law school too. It was a big deciding factor in not marrying her.

Yes. Instead of educating them, use their naivety as an opportunity to scam them. It's this type of thinking that's given crypto a bad name over the past few years.

I'll halve what he's halving!

Gotta love the disclaimer at the end, "65% of retail investors lose money when trading with this provider."

Good for you for raising your hand when no one else had the guts to.

Just remember to sell after you place the star on the tree.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:27:17
I guess you've never played co-op games.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:16:45
With the current trend the way it is, I think you would have been much better off had you begun averaging in here rather than buying all at once. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:22:04
Take out more loans and buy bitcoin. Duh
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:30:36
Quit acting like you never bought on the way up.

Sorry to have to break it to you, but that's not actually a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:16:50
HO HO HODL!

Don't think for one second that Mr. Wonderful believes that crap that comes out of his mouth. He's a skilled manipulator and that's precisely what he was doing.

I plan to move my bitcoin off exchanges for this event.

He’s already doing that

r/offmychest is a good place to go for emotional support.

He inherited money and wants to show it off now. This post has very little to do with bitcoin.

You saw this out in the wild? You don't say. Tell me more...
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:48:56
Does anyone really care about this stuff anymore?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:19:15
That was a very well rehearsed sales pitch. I may have to steal that one.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:38:40
The 2018 version was better imo
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:47:57
It better have been a platinum cheese and diamond encrusted pepperoni.

It's the great thing about being an Uber driver. Uber doesn't own you and you can go off the meter whenever you want.

The roasting by the host actually just made the Bitcoin guy's argument even stronger.
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:14:06
He didn't ask if it was the best time. He asked if it was the right time, to which there is a simple answer: yes.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:19:14
This sounds like something Craig Wright would try. No need to stoop to that level.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:38:32
Did you "type d that tyitle twice"?
