Definitely see your point. Thank you for taking the time explaining that. You have a great way with words!

True...maybe regulations? Maybe once bitcoin is capped out at 22 million there won't be much change in the price right? I'm still learning about bitcoin

I believe it will eventually. Bitcoin is unstoppable. Banks are stoppable

Do you invest or do you use crypto like you would use the dollar.

Does anyone think this will be an issue for people? The dollar and cent system is very simple, do any of you think the world will have to come up with a way to make bitcoins measurement system easier for people understand and interpret? Like will there be different names for bitcoin?

Already on the boat! Just crazy to think every new high is likely the new low.

The idiot is integrating Zcash into J.P. Morgan...he is a hypocrite

Ya know J.P. Morgan integrated Zcash (which is a cryptocurrency) into their blockchain technology. He is just saying this because he is frightened that one day he won't have his job because of crypto. And just like any currency the value is based on perception so if someone huge like him says something negative the price drops.
