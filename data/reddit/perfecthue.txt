Used this yesterday! I was at Campus Party on a work trip and had no clue it was there until I saw a photo of it on Reddit. Really prime location, right at the entrance.
The process was really fast. I still have the Coinbase iPhone app so I just had to hit request BTC, generate the QR, scan it, enter the cash and it hit my Coinbase account within a few seconds. 
I really wish Apple didn't take down that app, it's a lot easier for people new to Bitcoin than setting up a Blockchain wallet in a browser

I designed [these wallpapers]( last year and they've been getting a lot of use lately, so I figured I'd revamp the design a bit with some darker colors. Hope you guys like them.

Sure! I'll work on that tonight.

Looks like they used the [Bitcoin wallpaper I made]( and clone-stamped the hell out of the middle part to get rid of the logo: 
I posted a non-logo version in my thread that they could have used:

Thank you!

Might have to contact someone at Yelp to sort that out, but I made sure everything fit with their brand guidelines:

Nice work, they're all really well made. I'm a designer but I'm terrible at making icons, so I'll definitely put these to use some day.

I designed a few public domain graphics that represent decentralization/nodes that have been used quite a bit: 
So far I've seen them on Techcrunch, Forbes, Wired, BusinessInsider, etc.
I have a blockchain themed image that I've been working on whenever I have free time. I'll definitely post it soon.

I think Apple is more against being able to send/receive and buy/sell Bitcoin. Something like this would be the same as a price ticker app, which Apple allows because it's pretty much read-only.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:09:40
Hah that's awesome, glad you like it. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:51:41
I'm saying they modified [this version]( and tried to remove the logo with the clone stamp tool in Photoshop. They probably didn't see the version I posted without the logo.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:44:57
Happy to see my new graphic being used!

Credit isnt necessary since they're public domain, but I'd definitely appreciate it. You can do either, and a link to my site would be awesome too  
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:19:27
Glad to see it being spread around. A few other articles I noticed they've used it for:

Was doing a school project involving Bitcoin at the time and was extremely interested in it, but didn't think to invest until the price was around $30. Then I panic sold at around $60 when the price crashed from 260, and I've been buying high and selling low ever since :(

Nice, just a few blocks away from my apartment. I'll check it out today. Is there a list of the products they have?
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:07:52
They have a few at the bottom of their homepage: 
* Twitter
* Lyft
* Kickstarter
* Instacart
* Shopify
* Digitalocean 
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:00:56
Agreed! I'll keep these in mind for the next iteration
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:47:23
Got tips from some generous redditors so I'm happy. This will be an awesome addition to my resume/portfolio

Those details are painted. I turned the B into a selection and just lightly outlined it with a brush.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:20:20
I'm the designer of these [(full set)]( I also have PSDs available if you need to modify these for any reason: 
They're all free to use for anything you want, credit or no credit, commercial or non-commercial, whatever.

Ah, didn't know that. I totally thought stuff like this had to be approved first by the foundation.

This is a followup from my [post last week.](
Home page is mostly done (bottom part isn't fully responsive yet) and I still need to flesh out the rest of the pages. I think in a few weeks I'll have a demo site ready to test!
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:58:35
Some of the information is removed or altered, so the html they have up would need to be modified, but I was thinking of using their html as a base instead of starting from scratch to speed things up. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:43:14
He didn't sound very enthusiastic when he answered it, which surprised me. I thought he would talk more about his credit card idea, but he just kind of summarized Bitcoin.

Just updated the description on Flickr and on my portfolio to "No Rights Reserved - [CC0]( - This work is dedicated to the public domain." 
Haven't done this before, so is that legally sufficient?
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:55:54
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:00:03
Yup, click to expand was what I had in mind. Basically the same concept as [this]( 
Also I want the final design to be responsive, so looking good on mobile is a major priority.
@_date: 2013-06-01 22:11:46
Nope, I have some free time before I start my first full-time job (graduated a few weeks ago) so I'm using it to work on pro bono projects as well as freelance work. I figured I could help out with Bitcoin's image to the general public, since Bitcoin.org is the first place most people go when researching Bitcoin. The current site has great content that I can work off of, so it's mostly a matter of organizing it and presenting it in a better way. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:34:39
@_date: 2013-05-27 01:26:23
Thanks, I'll make a new thread on once I've made significant progress on the full site design.
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:10:24
Cheers! I'll start to mock up the functionality once I'm happy with the look and placement of everything. I was thinking of having those huge middle buttons expand content below them so people don't have to keep going to a brand new page like on the current site.

Posted these 7 months ago but wanted to share again for any new users. 
I'm a graphic designer and wanted to contribute to the Bitcoin community since there's a serious lack of clean Bitcoin graphics. No need to give me credit if you use these for any projects. 
I also have PSDs available if you need to modify anything:

About a month ago [someone suggested]( I try redesigning the official Bitcoin site, so this is a result of spending a few hours on it last night. I want to eventually code it too if I have time and hopefully send it to the Bitcoin foundation to use. 
I basically used the existing content and reordered some of the information, so if anyone has any suggestions on things to change, add, remove, it would definitely help!
edit- I also posted this on the [Bitcoin Talk forum](
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:49:56
Could you be more specific about what you don't like about it?
I'm mainly looking for opinions on the overall structure before I spend time working on the fine details. I figured it would help moving forward if I knew what elements need to be highlighted and what isn't too important for the average person.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:55:53
Awesome! I appreciate it
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:08:06

When his video appeared everyone in the audience was cracking up, and he started swaying his head back and forth while saying "woooo". So I think he was just trying to be funny. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:04:26
I'm going to work on another iteration tonight so I'll make sure to play around with the color scheme some more. It will probably look a lot better if I get rid of that top gradient.

I've changed the licenses of all 4 wallpapers to "Attribution Creative Commons"
However when I posted these [a while back]( my intention was to let people use these freely with or without credit. I don't know too much about licensing, but it doesn't seem like Flickr has a "public domain" sort of licensing option. All of them require attribution. Or maybe I'm just missing something.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:16:11
I'd love to see a photo!
@_date: 2013-05-26 20:20:19
I could definitely fit a video somewhere in that bottom section. The content there needs some work.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:01
Thanks! Yes, I do web design and some development. 
I agree about the Bitcoin site, the redesign could have been a lot better. I want to do more pro bono work for the Bitcoin community so I could attempt to redesign it myself when I have the time.
