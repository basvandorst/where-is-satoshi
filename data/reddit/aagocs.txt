I like how bitcoin makes sure everyone is learning a lesson before making them rich.

Because they are special type of heroes after all.

It's basically the same

Just for the context, most of that compute power only capable doing SHA256 which doesn't make a good supercomputer.

A lot of crypto going to india, because of mass scamming.

You know it's out of control when you need to make more depts to keep money in the system.

1s and 0s has a history of being valuable. Steam sells only digital copys of games, and people are spending 100$+ every month. Hearthstone is making massive money on selling digital cards. Bitcoin is also more special because you just can't torrent cracked Bitcoins.
