Ah, I thought that at first but decided against it because it's still $400,000 off, but I was using today's exchange rate
Turns out the USD-&gt;JPY exchange rate was around 110 at the time of those documents being released, which puts the USD number at around $5.5M
Apparently CNBC and Erik Voorhees never received the memo

wow thanks, TIL!

Like Erik said, lawyers will act in their own self-interest and will milk this case for every penny they possibly can.
The door in the face strategy is plausible but wouldn't that imply that CNBC is willingly participating in reporting false information?

That was a long time ago, like I said, these days I use Circle for my day-to-day transactions. 
Virwox doesn't have an exchange for USD to BTC (on purpose!) so there will be 4 fees: deposit, exchange USD for SLL, exchange SLL for BTC, then withdraw
Here's some info I pulled from [Virwox's help page](
**Regarding Deposits:**


**USD to SLL**


**SLL to BTC**


**Regarding Withdraws:**


Also keep in mind that Virwox is notorious for being slow, some people report 48+ hours for this type of transaction.
**Edit: It looks like [this site]( will calculate all the fees and give you a total "real conversion rate" in your case $30 will net you 0.04679385BTC which is about $26.54. You may want to check out  it could be much faster and slightly cheaper, your transaction is quite small but some sellers have low minimums**
edit: word

Yes they are legit.
The limits are very low for new accounts buying with Paypal
i use Paypal a lot through my job so I got a Paypal debit card (free) and linked it to my Circle account. This provides a starting weekly limit of 0.52BTC (~$300) which can be increased over time.

Kim didn't "come up with the idea of encryption" either. In fact...


@_date: 2016-08-10 10:30:07
Interesting, thanks for your reply
Does this imply that you disagree with Erik's statement about lawyers milking the case for their own self-interests? Or is that factored in to the 1%?


Woah, would you mind sharing a source for this bit?

This guy explains how Cost per Transaction is calculated:

is that way --&gt;

There probably is such a list, but finding your specific address within it would probably be impossible unless you know more details such as some of the exact previous transactions, exact balance, etc.
It doesn't really matter because resetting the phone has deleted the private key of the wallet, meaning the funds will never be spendable again. This is one of MANY reasons to never store crypto on a mobile device.

Sadly that won't stop them from trying to regulate/ban/destroy it

I'm curious what this means for federal income tax?

Not really, I cashed Wells Fargo checks for years without having an account there.

Interesting post, thanks for sharing
Are your panels set up with sun tracking?
I've read that you can produce up to 40% more power throughout the course of the year by using 2-axis tracking. It seems that more power per panel = less panels needed = less investment = faster roi
