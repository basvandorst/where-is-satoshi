Again, they still will want your info. Don't you understand what i'm saying?

What a load of crap.

Same here. The new wallet is horrible. What were they thinking. 
Don't they have users testing it before going live?
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:38:05
What kind of logic is that?
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:43:54
Because you can send money online?

Ross ran an internet drug market and got caught because of extremely bad op-sec. 
You're bordering delusions.

He should not be in jail for life but please man, stop saying things like running a small drugs business. It looks ridiculous. He ran a massive drug operation. Absolutely massive. At least let's stick to the facts.

You're a customer. What you pay with doesn't matter. 
Many here think that bitcoin somehow will completely eliminate the need for private info. This is completely false. Companies still will want your info, even if you pay with Bitcoin. 
Seriously? Downvoted? Why?

It was presented in court. His lawyer fought it by calling it roleplaying. The judge used it against Ross in her sentence. Know your facts. Lying won't help anyone. 
You don't have to agree with it but please don't downvote me for posting simple facts which all can be found in the official court papers. Including the many chats about having people killed and transactions in the blockchain. I'm not saying i agree with this shit, i just think we shouldn't spread false info. 
The hitman thing was part of the case and part of the sentence.

I noticed people here get really upset when there is a rumor that whatever terrorist group uses bitcoin. 
If bitcoin is as good as we like to think why wouldn't they use it? What's so odd about a terror group using bitcoin. 
We want everyone to use bitcoin. But not them?
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:42:22
Yet we keep pushing for poor African countries to use Bitcoin because it will save them?
Anyway, IS is highly active on the internet so your comment is worthless anyway. You are really naive if you think all these people live in a tent in the desert.

The transactions of the would be murders are on the blockchain. Is this also faked by the fbi? All the chats about the would be murders also faked? Everything is just fake fake fake?
You don't like it so it's fake?
Again, i think his sentence is insane but we can't just ignore facts because we don't like them.

Bitcoinity? No?
