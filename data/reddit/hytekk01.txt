I add a article from coindesk, 
I'm glad to live in a winter country after all. 
I enjoy smart heating from my miner.
I find it cool to heat my home and generate bitcoin
at the same time.

Bitcoin mining is stabilizing, scrypt mining is way too much risky, I agree.
I have good hope to ROI my SHA256 miner, just need a nice rise of bitcoin prices, it will come 200% sure : )

Customer had replaced his power supply for bigger ATX P/S. Run fine again. No electronic design will work if the power supply is incorrect. Electronic  rule, never load at 100% ...
My Rockminer R3 Box need 500W, I supply it with a XFX850W.
My ASICMiner Tube need 1000W, EVGA 1300w G2 Supernova.
So 20-30% room, load at 70-80%. No problem at all...

So far I can't complain about Gawminers, they had keep their promises, deliver on time, compensated for bugs/delays, give freebies ...  I order lots of miners from them, I talk from my own experience.
It's way better than my purchase with Hashra. It was a lunar luncher I ordered last june. They hold my order for 4 weeks. Can't phone them, did not reply to my email etc ... 
When you phone call at GAW, they answer and solve your issue kindly.
