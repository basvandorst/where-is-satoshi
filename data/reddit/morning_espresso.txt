Got it. Thanks for the explanation. I've done a bit of trading and have found one or two fairly predictable trends that I track for. This sounds like another one to watch for, though I can't imagine this doesn't come back to bite a whale from time to time.

Isn't that a bit risky? Can't a wall easily push the price into a downward trend?

Way to go, grandpa!

This feels like a plot line for Antiques Road Show circa 2129. While I'd be surprised if the BTC was still on the hard drive, I suppose you never know. Good Luck, OP!

You've got to start somewhere. I bought a few hundred $$ not quite a month ago. While things have gone up and down this month, it's been a decent investment, compounding on average about 1% daily (almost a 33% return for the month so far). If it continues on this trend for the next year, I could be looking at a 5 digit return without investing any further capital. That said, don't get too excited. It's hard to say if we'll see this level of return each month. We may be due for a correction. I guess time will tell, but in the mean time I'll keep hodling.

A toaster that stores bitcoins. That's when you know we've gone too far with this whole smart appliance thing.

Really sorry, bud. I don't have any advice other than to just tell you how sorry I am to hear about your situation. Please don't beat yourself up over this. Cryptos are still in that wild west stage in my opinion. I know this may sound a bit trite, but it is true - you can always make more money. There's only one you, so please take care of yourself.
For everyone else, please take care to carefully review exchange sites, wallets and other related crypto sites. Understanding the technology that drive cryptos is not always easy. It can be complicated. Make sure you know what you are doing as best you can. If in doubt, go with respected, trusted methods. Test out new sites, wallets, etc with only small amounts of your currency.
OP is certainly not the first person that has been scammed. There is a reason why scammer scum are out there doing these sorts of things. Very smart people get scammed and caught off guard every day.

Maybe he needed the money at the time? Circumstances can make it hard to hold out and wait.

I hear you. Life doesn't always go the way we would hope, and you just have to do the best you can at the time.

Exactly. And truth be told, Jobs probably would have found a way to buy this guy out early on. Jobs wasn't known to be generous. He really was known to be more of an asshole at times when it came to company ownership and shares. I'd guess he would not have wanted this guy holding 10% of the company. Maybe I'm wrong? But there certainly are stories where he screwed other people who helped him build up Apple early on.

I feel like the email framed it as a policy driven and implemented by USAA, but I'm sure that could be the case. I guess to be fair it is only the credit card and not their banking accounts/cards.

A bit surprising to me since USAA recently sent me an email stating that they were banning crypto purchases with the USAA credit card.
