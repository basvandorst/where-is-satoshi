the boomers are in for a big surprise, not only do they hate computers, 
bitcoin is going to slowly suck and crash the overpriced boomers only investment.. housing..
and when it does, they will have quickly learn how to use bitcoin,  but it will be too late
it's time for us young people to fight back, and hit them where it hurts, they're pockets,

bitcoin is not going away, 
bitcoin solves so many problems,
i will no longer need to use my credit alone which will solve the problem of hackers stealing your identity,  
it's market manipulation or early adopters cashing out, 
you can't hold on to bitcoin forever, there's a time in your life when you can take all that earning and improve your life
buy bitcoin for the technology and not the greed
bitcoin is the future

i think its the other way around, the banks corrupted politicians and won't allow them to bring change, so they are corrupted by force since decades

in 20 years i haven't paid any fees to the bank because i always keep at least 10 grand in my account,
i knew this was coming, luckily ive transferred most of my savings into bitcoin several years ago
i could afford paying into negative interest rates without breaking the bank as i always have lived below my means,  
im just waiting on coinbase to allow direct deposit from our workplace, then i really have no reason for banks now, 
i can currently live off bitcoin buying amazon, walmart and gas giftcards
i really only need cash for rent

I got in bitcoin because paypal blocked my account
I love having controll of my own money
I used to want to cash out some of my gains in the past but as Bitcoin gets bigger the less I want to cash out, instead I want to use it
I hate the banks and the corrupt system we live in
I will fight and die for my bitcoin 
I will never sell my bitcoin 
i will use it instead... it's sound money
it's not dirty banker money

I would prefer not to say too much, although i'm not saying i know a lot. But i just know what I am told and what I overhear in our conversations. Also don't forget reddit is partly funded by chinese investors.  So people's lives could always be on the line from what i say. 
The problem that faces the world and the chinese communist party is how to slowly wean off the usd without causing a global crash or worse a world war which is what the americans have left in them. Along side the massive profits that are to be made if there ever was a hot war with the weapons manufactures.  i'm sure you have been noticing this year more and more anti-chinese therads. There's a reason for that.   
They couldn't just come out and say "our digital currency is now backed by bitcoin" as much as they would like to, the world isn't even close to being prepared for that type of drastic change. The last thing China wants or needs is a hot war with america of the states. if you can understand mandarin a good book is 超限战
The CCP has come to terms that at the beginning the world will not trust their digital currency, unless it's backed by something and as much as they keep accumulating gold, gold still is loosing value as a store of value since bitcoin was born. China was the first ones to go digital with wechat all over their country. Gold will simply not work anymore especially now that they recently were able to create almost 99% gold from cheap copper.
There is no other way militarily to defeat the usa the best way is to take monetary power from them. The CCP never excepted bitcoin and still unknown who is satoshi. The best they can do is work with it and understand it. The CPP has no plans to back down, they're way past that.
Pay attention to Canada. There's a reason why canada sold most of it's gold reserves back in the year 2016 and recently stated that they are also working on a crypto currency, and have not banned huawei from their country yet. It's has to do with china, but i am don't know anymore about china and canada. 
As for the usa, they are definitely involved behind the scenes with bitcoin as well. But the CPP has no idea what the usa is planning. it's tightly sealed.
They believe a big digital gold rush 2.0 is coming that the world has never seen. Weather that means bitcoin or countries digital currencies that for you to decide.

ive said it before, banks will have to adapt or die, 
i transferred all my savings from RBC years ago, 
even now as soon as i get paid, i transfer it to coinbase, trade for bitcoin then send it offline,
i only keep a little bit on my rbc account, if rbc allowed me to buy bitcoin and have a bitcoin wallet, id keep alot more in my rbc account so i could use it daily, 
i get alot of older people asking me about bitcoin, but its too hard for them to deal with all the computer stuff, 
this is the right direction for mainstream/older people
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:46:33
I find a lot of these times it's people's fault. 
lots of people have no basic cyber security knowledge and especially in windows there is lots of virus and malware targeted towards people who click links without thinking. 
people are still not educated in how to use a computer safely 
yes the banks are also at fault but the people as well, this is why mainstream won't use Bitcoin for a while. u need intelligence to use Bitcoin

my husband works for the communist party,
their plan is to make their new Chinese digital currency backed by bitcoin
this way, they can still keep control of their population while dominating trade around the world,
they will not allow their population to use bitcoin, instead they will store people's bitcoin for them, and pay them in their Chinese digital currency,
they will store bitcoin in cold storage for all of their population,
the chinese don't want to control everyone in the world, they want to control only their population while maintaining the number 1 export country in the world
they know bitcoin is the future, so they are accumulating bitcoin, if they keep bitcoin then they will not fall back to the bottom, they will continue being the number 1 economy
the usa is in trouble

i want someone to build a browser or extension where i can upload satoshi's on the lightning network so i can donate satoshi's to websites i like without kyc
i tired brave but it was dumb cuz it was some other shitcoin and to cash out you needed kyc as well, 
yes i agree with that one dude, companies need to focus on bitcoin and not their own shitcoins,
theres too many shitcoins

bitcoin taught me to live below my means so luxury hotels are no interest to me, 
but it's good they are accepting bitcoin

if you hacked 200 million really the only thing you could do is slowly change it into monero, you could probably live a simple life without ever worrying about money, but you would never spend even close to 1/4 of it
now if you wanted to life the high life of spending alot and buying many cars, i think you would eventally get caught, its hard to not get caught with that much money

this is only going to get worse as more decentralized applications are made, we are heading towards an internet where nothing can be censored, it's probably good in a certain sense because i find most people think the world is nice, and a lot of parents even leave their kids alone with sports, priests,
we are going to see the true world for what it is, so fucked up
i went on the dark web once, and people were talking about drugging women and raping them, and which drugs to use, it was an eye opening
im not surprised by the graph, i remember the police saying that years ago, that they can't keep up,
these are some interesting times that we are going to see where the internet will take us, and how it's going to change society
i will make sure to surf the internet along side my kids so they don't see any bad things

400 dollars of that is mine, i haven't had time to move it off coinbase, 
i usually buy them keep them in them for a month, then move it off
i would never keep more than 500 on coinbase for long periods of time

i like bisq, i downloaded it to try it out, 
i would've used it in the past, but now it's very easy to buy bitcoin anywhere, 
i would recommend everyone to try it out
i heard its decentralized, not sure if it really is or not, i will eventually make 1 transaction on it

i doubt they have much money to spare, 
they are in the same boat as millions of other young people around the world, can't find good jobs, low wages, and extremely expensive rent and out of reach housing
