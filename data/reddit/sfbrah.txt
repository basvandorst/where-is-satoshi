I didn't look at your post history. Fees on bitcoin are fucked though, bitcoin cash is superior

My conclusion was that this subreddit is mainly name calling (btrash), character assassination (BLAME ROGER AND JIHAN), and censorship. No one here really wants to talk about bigger blocks processing more transactions and making it faster and cheaper. They want to talk about roger and how they got so confused by the name so it must be a scam.
I think bigger blocks is a better solution than clinging to a coin that doesn't function as a currency anymore with high fees and transaction times on BTC being evidence to support the claim. The counter argument, that big blocks would lead to centralization, seems like that's questionable when you calculate how much memory it takes to store the blockchain and how much that memory would cost. I also think using private off chain networks is more centralized than requiring a node to have more memory.

If you have a coinbase account, you also have a gdax account. Same login/pw, it's coinbase exchange. 
Taxes start to get complicated when you day trade so make sure it's something you want to do. I make a few trades a week when I'm sure it will increase my stack and most of my crypto is on cold storage. You don't want to get goxed
