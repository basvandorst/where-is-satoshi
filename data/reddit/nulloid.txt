Yet half of the nation couldn't.

George Soros said that he thinks Bitcoin has such a high value because of a misunderstanding, but the blockchain technology has a huge amount of potential. *EDIT: He is actually using it to help people, so I'd say he understands the tech at least. [Source.](
But I have some problems with this table. For example, how does the fact that Paul Krugman mispredicted the internet's impact proves he doesn't understand economics or tech? Are there any other famous people who understand tech/eco but are against bitcoin, or vice-versa? How do we know it is not a cherry-picked list?
I think this table is just propaganda. Basically it says "If you are against Bitcoin, you don't understand shit." Well... I think cryptocurrencies are a major part of the future, but I don't think Bitcoin is the way to go.

Don't worry, I wouldn't defend you on any day :'D

He won't, his identity is based on his beliefs. Such beliefs are notoriously hard to change, and you have to supply an alternative one, so they can at least "hotswap" that belief. ~~(Won't look for the source, if you don't mind, I'm really tired.)~~ [Found the source]( at about 48:30.
Consider a table, where the face of the table is one's identity, and the legs are supporting beliefs. If you try to remove one, the table topples over - you have to swap it with another one, so the table stands still.
Unfortunately, I can't translate this into practice.

He is actively helping people, while you wallow in hatred for a man you haven't even met, just heard about from various sources, and trying to "prove" your belief with one video, and discrediting any evidence against your agenda.
I don't think either of you are evil, but I do think you are immature and prone to brainwashing. Your whole identity is based on what you think about him. He defines what you are - and he didn't even have to do anything.
Think about it. Or not. Hell, I'm not your father, you do what you want.

Not only that, but he isn't against bitcoin per se. He just thinks it is overvalued ("based on a misunderstanding"), but he is actually using the blockchain technology to help people. (According to [his speech]( he held recently.) So I would say he understands the tech at least.

Fair enough.


[Found this]( after a quick search, although haven't verified. Tried with other keywords, but haven't found much. Guess I won't be able to contribute much.
But one question isn't very clear to me: are we strictly talking about Bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies as a whole?
(Also kudos for replying in a calm manner in spite of my harsh criticism.)

You seem to know an awful lot about economics, could you please ELI5 why their knowlegde is only partially applicable?

I opened the video, but i hear nothing. IDK if it is just the headphone at work, I'll take a look at it at home.


Scroll down.


Also, your posts here showed that one should not expect rational behaviour from you.

Looking at the direction of the US economy, I'd say pretty good.

Have you considered getting a nice wristpad? RSI is not a nice thing to have.

BTC going below $8,000: **verifiable fact**.    
BTC not reaching $100k by 2019: **speculation** (as of early 2018).
Don't mix up the two.
EDIT: What was downvote-worthy about it?
