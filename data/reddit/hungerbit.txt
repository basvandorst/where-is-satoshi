The long wallet numbers, the fee I need to pay to buy bitcoin, the lack of merchants accepting it, the pk that if I lose or forget is gone forever, no insurance on balances.. sure there's more, just can't seem to think of it now...
PS I'm a huge crypto fan

If central banks issued notes like these, they could lend against their bitcoin holdings, paper value only - scan the back of note to view current fiat value

Retirement equals long term investing. Bitcoin is the future, not the past. Keep it in there for 20 years and may well end up being 90% of your portfolio value.

I agree - the article was an asshole move. Talking about how cheap of a ring he got for his gf - how about the guy didn't have any money and was in love.

I created HungerBIT last night because I love 
1. Bitcoin 
2. Building and creating new ideas
I'm not sure how much traction I will get or if I can get enough to cover the required donation amount. 
I'm super busy with my job so if I can get enough donations, I have a good person I can hire to get this started. 
I personally paid for the domain and hosting service. Plus I will donate 0.17 bitcoins to the wallet when I get a chance. My current phone is broken so I can't hit the send button from Coinbase. 
First time ever posting on Reddit, but r/bitcoin is my favorite place to come daily. 
Thanks Redditers!

I think you'll lose them on "block".
