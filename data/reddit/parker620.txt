These are all repeating the same thing basically. Take it all with a grain of salt, but it is what it is.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:14:46
Bring the FUD. These are the same people, saying the same things, that they said when BTC was at $1000. The fact that BTC has made remarkable grains, and growth, is irrefutable. The weak and fearful will have nobody but themselves to blame. Remember, zoom out.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:23:25
Okay. I'd recommend fully reading an article before you post, just my opinion. Have a good one! :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:21:53
You need to speak to some form of investment expert. I'd suggest finding a financial advisor and discussing your thoughts/plans with them. They will tell you not to, but they can probably tell you how to legally make this unwise choice.
Also, I'm pretty sure the  rule of Bitcoin is not to put in more than you can afford to lose. Don't invest all of your family's money into this unless they are 100% okay with losing ALL of that money. That is a possibility, just remember that.

It's ironic that this "cryptoclothingclub" doesn't even accept crypto as payment.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:44:19
The second question was rhetorical, merely trying to point out that the term wasteful is entirely subjective. What YOU define as waste, and what others define as waste can be different. Again, why do you think that the energy being used to mine bitcoin is wasteful? The energy is turned into btc, which has intrinsic value imo, but also has fiat value. Also, what about renewable energy sources? You're blaming bitcoin for something that it has no real control over at the moment. Hydropower, geothermal power, wind, solar, etc. all of these renewable resources pave the path to a future where btc is the currency.

Personally, I'd suggest opening an account with a local bank or cu. The only reason I say that is because if they're smaller, you should be able to handle any issues you may face with this account in person. I use a bank that is only local to my state, I've had issues with exchanges debiting too much a couple of times. One call/visit fixed those situations in less than 48 hours usually. Personal preference of course, although I hear great things about Ally.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:32:39
Do you understand Bitcoin at all? Have you read the FAQ in the sidebar? How long of an investment is this? What are your investment choices besides gold/btc? This is an extremely open-ended question. 20k isn't a small amount, don't be glib about this.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:00:54
Yeah, not a bad guide at all. I was just curious as to why coinbase was chosen. I get it, it's still the easiest to use for people who are hesitant about crypto as a whole. Thanks! Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:35:00
Why is coinbase the recommended exchange? Just curious.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:03:17
Are you saying btc is inaccessible?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:49:59
I suppose blaming was also a poor choice of words. My apologies. I'm just trying to understand the premise behind the question I suppose. Why does it matter if btc mining uses a lot of energy? I mean, so long as we stop negatively impacting the environment to create energy. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:07:10
This is literally spam. Why did you even post this?
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:19:44
Really? Almost all of my coinbase buys are debited from my bank in a day or two at most. I have my bank account linked though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:17:59


I think that in the current crypto market those two terms are contradictory.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:58:37
Word. I feel you. Don't get me wrong, currently btc has a negative impact on the environment. Well, most likely. But that's only because of how we as a society produce energy. We produce energy via means that negatively impact the environment, which in turn makes anything that uses energy also negatively impact the environment. Or at least that's how I see it. Cheers!

Hey! I live in Colorado, USA and it immediately showed USD for me! Thanks!

Why do you see the energy consumption as a waste? How can agriculture decrease it's wasteful use of water?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:47:53
Reduce electrical consumption? I doubt it, but I really have no clue. But that seems to be a trivial question. Energy consumption would only need to be reduced if energy were to remain finite or increase in value. If we continue to develop renewable sources of energy, I don't see the need to decrease energy consumption. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:50:42
Here's to hoping! See you in three weeks!
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:10:14
You shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. Period.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:30:12
So what you're saying is, the fire sale will last until I get paid? Wooo!
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:39:31
How IS it wasteful? Seriously, you're working under the assumption that Bitcoin itself has no value. Waste, in this context, is a subjective term.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:15:01
Hey! I'd just like to say that your personal opinion, and interaction, with Democrats and Republicans is a pretty poor representation of either party. I say that because being a D or R doesn't mean you automatically feel a certain way about something. Party affiliation shouldn't define who we are or how we feel about things. I'd also like to point out that you're making broad generalizations about large swathes of the US. Why does it matter the political demographic that supports cryptocurrency? I mean, why are you interested in it? Just curious!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:53:02
Ahh I see. Well, if you have capital locations near you, I'd suggest going that route. The cu's and banks I spoke to never said anything about me setting up an account strictly for crypto-trading. Also, says good things about capital. I'd maybe message and see if he/she has any insight. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:17:37
If you seriously have a client who is receiving 2million dollars worth of BTC and they want to turn that into fiat currency (USD) then you need to research BTC and explain how they do that. This will take time and energy. I'm still unsure about what you need help with. There's a whole sidebar of information that can answer any of the questions you might have.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:48:17
Ahh I see. I still have a coinbase account, and it is definitely the easiest to use for people who have never done any type of investing online. My biggest gripe with coinbase is that, if you use coinbase instead of GDAX, then you are forced to wait 5 days before your btc arrives in the exchange wallet. That makes it nearly impossible to day-trade. Oh well. 
I did just get signed up on Kraken though, and it took ~24 hours to get tier 2 verified. Not quite as intuitive ui as coinbase, but close. I also feel that Kraken has more advanced options, if new users decide to explore crypto trading further.

Increase in miners doesn't = increase in blocks mined per minute? Are you sure? 


So you're saying that 1 cpu computing all of btc is the exact same speed as all the miners we currently have? I don't think you're right about that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:08:50
LOL I think you're lying out of your ass. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:29:28
This is a scam. What makes you think this is even remotely real? Seriously, when is the last time your place of employment discussed your advancement through mail?
Or you could totally send me all your bank login information and I'll gladly set up your Bitcoin wallet within minutes! /s
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:11:02
Jeremy is that you?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:46:07
Ahh, I see. That's interesting because I'm a pretty hardcore liberal, and I support Crypto because I don't like the current monetary policy we work under. I have several friends that are also liberal and they all support Crypto because they don't like centralized currency. Weird :P
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:18:26
Again, if you'd look at the sidebar, the FAQ guide explains that you don't need an otc broker. You are your own. You can set up your own accounts on these exchanges, and that is how you change from crytpo to fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:06:48
This might be the most bait-y comment I've ever seen. Good luck fishing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:33:33
No, I meant this person specifically. My bad.

I literally did quit my job Monday. But it was to take a new position with better pay, commute, and hours. Then I got rewarded with a nice sale on bitcoin. Hooray Christmas! Hodl on.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:05:04
Today was the day I bought for the first time ever. At 8k. Hodl to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:30:33
So, in a fiat economy, you create more fiat currency to lend. That is, with a centralized bank creating that currency, and there is no centralization with BTC. There is a finite number of BTC. If my assumptions are correct, when BTC replaces fiat, there will be no lending of any kind. Personally, I see that as an inherent barrier to the end goal of universal BTC. I am hoping to stimulate discussion on this topic, as it seems that this is a major flaw that will need to be addressed sooner rather than later. I appreciate your response!
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:33:31
I am aware that the current way fiat economies handle credit is imperfect and often times predatory. However, there are times that credit is useful and necessary. Credit/lending seems like a necessary tool in a major economy. Or are you suggesting that credit should/will be gone in the future? Thanks for responding!
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:51:28
You're assuming that at some point BTC value stagnates. I don't think that will happen, due to the finite number of BTC available.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:11:52
Well, as was mentioned earlier, if we use smart contracts for everything it seems that we won't need credit or lending services. I mean, there would only ever be interest-free lending in theory. Which would lead to just buying the product on a smart contract I imagine.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:39:07
P2P lending seems non-viable though, as does crowdsourcing/microinvestments. I say this because I do not understand the way these loans would be secured. Or would they just be unsecured loans that, if defaulted on, leaves all the lenders out to dry? I just can't wrap my head around how BTC will handle debt in the future. How will we ensure debts are repaid? 
Side note: I feel like I'm echoing statements from when the US started really issuing credit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:03:46
Is it possible that BTC lending/credit will just have to be interest free? Worst-case scenario somebody just borrows BTC until it increases enough in value that they have however much they were borrowing for in the first place. Or at least, worst-case I can imagine. Any thoughts? I agree; there will need to be a reinvention of the modern economy, which means chaos, and will absolutely bring violence. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:17:07
I'm actually really pissed that I couldn't get my finances together to buy during the last drop. But oh well.
