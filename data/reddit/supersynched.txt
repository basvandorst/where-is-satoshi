For the past few months, I've started giving away Bitcoin as tips. Being in a country where Bitcoin awareness is not that high, I had to make a short instruction manual in order for the people to actually know how to receive them. The manual is the size of the smallest bill for the country I am currently at. I give it out to different nationalities (Indians, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Filipino, Egyptians, Syrians, etc!) I'll probably make a translation to different languages later on.
Just a brief background, I currently work in a foreign country where tips are not actually added to the invoice. So I usually give them a small amount in fiat and hand this over to them. 
Hopefully this will help raise awareness to countries where Bitcoin is not that popular!
