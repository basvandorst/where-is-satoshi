Hindsight being 20/20, yes you probably would be :P You'd probably be 3-4x richer than OP (if not more), in fact.
But it's important to note that BTC is meant to be a currency. A currency is only valuable if it's used in actual transactions, otherwise it's basically like gold; you keep it around in case your own nation's fiat currency fails you. BTC doesn't have a *lot* of use in transactions yet, so it's not as reliable as (for example) the USD, which is used for transactions almost universally. 
So it's not really certain what BTC's value will do. There's a lot of speculation that the current boom is prices is just a bubble and will drop soon. There's also a lot of people who have been involved for a long time who are convinced that we'll never seen prices as low as $20 again.
I haven't paid enough attention to the market to be able to say much more than that.

I'll step in. Mining is done by computing very large numbers, which takes time. At first, mining bitcoins was easy, most anyone could run a program overnight and find new bitcoins in their wallet the next day. However, the bitcoin system was designed so that as more bitcoins entered the network, mining them became harder. The curve is meant to limit the amount that average people can actually make, and then very soon after, limit the amount entire datacenters could make.
The currency has a very real maximum limit, and its inflation is strictly expected and planned.
