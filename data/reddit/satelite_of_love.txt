What was your turn around time? This gives me a bit of hope.

I don't know if it's wrong or right.... But I'm right there with ya...
Wish I would have bought way more than I did back in the $4.00 days.
(That was the earliest I remember being aware of them)

Ok... I'm a complete newb to all this and computertarded but would it be possible to incentivize a p2p network by rewarding bc to "seeders".
I'm just thinking out loud here to a group far more intelligent than I, but what if you created a demonoid type of thing where you could register and seed and the incentive to doing so was some set amount (% of trades done on the network) awarded to you basses on your seeding history and contribution.
Like the mining pools have a % fee they keep so would the p2p network and that's what would be distributed to the seeders. 
I don't know, just what popped into my head when I saw the words p2p. I should probably read up on what ripple actually is (never heard of it) and what we're actually talking about before i open my mouth.

I think they once did well and the person the ran it disappeared.
I have never received any communication from them AT ALL and still have an outstanding order that's never been filled. Course at today's prices it's a nearly $2000.00  big jambox I still haven't gotten. Something like 2.8BC gone

Perfect! Got one ordered with them! Waiting on some funds to transfer and clear for a few more.

Wanted to update everyone. . .
Still no word from BTC Shop (at all)
HOWEVER . . . I did receive my coinabul order today. I also received an email from the owner explaining the delay. I'm glad I wasn't duped out of that order. 
It should also be noted I place an order with agoracommodities.com per suggestion about 5 days ago and received that order in about 3 days total. . . a day before I got the coinabul order I placed over a month ago.

I'm in with whatever BC i have at the time (not much) and whatever spare usd I can scape together when it come to fruition.

I like that I can use a CC here (to avoid the transfer delays assoc with getting some more BC) however their site's security cert seems invalid at the check out screen. . . 
Since I'm a computer newb this scares me. . . Thanks though!

I see some pretty ridiculous prices there but Thanks! Should have thought to check there first. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 14:19:10
I think my lesson going forward is to only utilize vendors with escrow...

Great timing! Hopefully it lasts until my transfer clears Monday!!
