Email address sieves are [documented as an RFC,]( but not universally used. Moreover some sites reject emails with a "+" sign.  Gmail allows it though.

Exactly! Why do so many people drink Coca Cola or eat at McDonalds?  part of the answer is that the products are consistently good (not necessarily great), but after that, the winner has the best *marketing*

I'm cool with that, but you get no social services, no police protection, no fire department, and no ability to drive on the (publicly funded) roads.

You do pay the debt, but the money becomes worthless in the process. Worth noting is the fact that Greenspan is temperamentally a Libertarian, and his views generally reflect that world view.

Bitcoin is very much traceable.  They may not be able to stop a transfer of funds, but as long as we exist in physical form, governments can rule us (and seize our passports).

Blockchain is just a method of accounting and is no more tied to a currency than double entry bookkeeping.

Paper money has been on the wane for decades. Blockchain accounting is the future.

There's no reason fiat currency cannot use blockchain. Credit is still necessary and community policing will always fall short of the power of the state to imprison people for debts incurred.

I don't *blame* officials charged with public safety for trying to take away freedoms as such actions are totally in line with what we ask them to do.  Freedom is a loaded term; when one has freedom to follow one's desires then it becomes natural to worry as to the nature of those desires, and since the government cannot read minds (yet), they are left with tracking your movements through toll booths and your cell phone GPS.
And lets not give the private sector a free pass on this matter simply because many are inclined to hate the government first.  It's simply becoming easier for organizations to track people.

My point exactly. Maybe blockchain ledgers *are* different and offer capabilities that cash, gold etc do not? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:09:32
Same argument the NRA makes about the press and scary looking guns.  Violence would happen with or without those particular weapons just as money laundering would occur using [holding company owned accounts]( cash, [blockchain ledger]( [commodities]( or precious metals.
**This is why I am in favor of stricter gun laws. Because the argument is absurd.** Furthermore just as a 20 round magazine affords extra capabilities to a weapon that includes it as a feature, blockchain adds abilities that cash doesn't have.  So perhaps blockchain *does* facilitate money laundering.

Bitcoin and other blockchain can be just as solid an investment as railroad stocks in the 19th century; that is to say both real profit potential and yet also a [bubble for many.](

Exactly, this is how Sony, Universal, Warner were destroy.... oh wait they are doing just fine?  Hows that?  Marketing can convince people to buy Coca Cola when water ~~is free~~ falls from the sky, is healthier and [other brands are cheaper]( or [higher quality](
Banks don't merely exchange money, they manage pension and sovereign funds worth trillions and the denomination of the accounts is almost a detail.  The big firms are already investing in blockchain ledgers and mining is done most extensively - not by individuals -  but by [server farms in China](

Yes, police departments funded by group associations &amp;mdash; if you are not a member and are beaten or raped, *tough* &amp;mdash;  public libraries considered unfair competition to book stores and medical care costs resolved by free market forces despite the fact that a person facing immediate illness or critical injury has *zero* ability to research free market options. 
No absolute position, be it Libertarianism or Socialism fixes all social ills, the solution is in the gray areas.

Yes, there are a limited number of coins in any given ledger, but there is no limit to the number of ledgers people can contrive (litecoin, dogecoin etc).  What does this mean?  Not sure, but it might mean that crypto ledgers are like soft drinks, and the winner will have the best market penetration / advertising / customer service (software).

Bitcoin pays no more interest than the dollar or any currency.  That's what banks and investment firms assist with after all.  In fact, once competing cryptocurrencies start to be commonplace, banks will come back with even more bewildering derivatives marketing.
