(Author here) Yep; there's a lot of work to be done. I think the block size debate is at the 'too many cooks' point right now, hopefully we can redirect some energy into different avenues that are just as critical in the longterm while we allow for careful thought on the best way to increase transactions per second.

(Author here) Glad you liked it. Consider reading more closely though, I indeed mention the need for a new soft fork roll out mechanism.
I think you should consider that largely Bitcoin's technical issues aren't technical. For instance, 20mb block sizes would be no problem if we all lived in Seoul. We know how to build fast connections, but access to them is low.
The things you mentioned are definitely good directions and things to fix. There is a lot of brilliant engineering effort being put into Bitcoin to make it scale in algorithmic complexity, we need to shore up from many other angles to really scale. Some of them are softer than others!

(Author here) That is the point of the article. We don't need this much attention on block size, community should be thinking about these.

I see where you're coming from.
To clarify, my list of things was not "here's everything that needs to happen before block size", it was, "8 Problems for the Bitcoin Community to Solve Before Block Size". Certainly there are other technical problems to solve.
To work in your metaphor, there are two main ways to fight fires. One way, is to get a fire extinguisher and locally put out the fire. The other is to hit the sprinklers and drench the building. For a small fire, you want to avoid the latter at all costs because the water damage will be more than the fire. So yeah, let's deal with the fire but I'm sure we can find an extinguisher instead of a sprinkler.
Yes, the issues I listed are "cancer-like" in that they are not necessarily solvable and may be moving targets. The point is we should spend less energy trying to fight this fire as it will likely be destructive.

(Author here) Issues, subjective properties, whatever. The point is that they aren't where we want them to be.
Sure, my privacy and usability is not the same as yours. But I think that when Bitcoin is not sufficient for most of it's users that's where we can pretty clearly say, "mission not accomplished". This means the challenges there are two fold, both identifying what new users need (which requires looking outside the current community) and how to make it usable enough so that it is a tangible improvement over the status quo.
The point of the article is to try to provide some new fodder to chew on for the larger Bitcoin community on issues that present a larger barrier to useful* adoption than Block size. Can you please provide a counter example of why block size is more critical to fix than any of these?
* Adopting a broken platform is not useful

Author here; can verify if desired.

One thing I think that it's important to realize: this isn't all about blocksize, almost all of the improvements and metrics discussed and developed at the event would be relevant even under controversial hardforks ;)
I really hope to see wide participation from the community with this event; it's important that many perspectives be explained.

FYI there are currently 3 'competing' lightning network implementations.
'cool story bro'
