I'm a Bitcoin maximalist.

This is the company working on side chains: 
They are apparently in talks with VCs about funding.
And then there are some pull requests in Bitcoin's github made by Mark Friedenbach (Maaku) that help side chain implementation. 
So definetly things are happening.

Good catch. Looking back at Austin's twitter history, it's no surprise.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:45:55
It might pave the way for bitcoin, but that's it.

This guy is one of the most valuable assets in the Bitcoin community. Now we get to enjoy even more of his work, great!

Wouldn't Open Transactions with voting pools and auditing achieve this? I'm afraid OT doesn't get the attention it deserves :(

I noticed that too. They should have used "No one claims it's die Endlösung"
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:06:05
Holy shit, we need sidechains and fast. This altcoin thing is such a drag on the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:47:44
That was quite an achievement, congrats!

I'm afraid that they don't really understand the concept if they are worried that Bitcoin will be the Netscape of cryptos.
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:11:29
Hopefully with 2-way pegs.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:49:34
Obviously if Bitcoin succeeds in the way many of us vision it, investing in Blockstream and the core Bitcoin tech pays off ridiculously well.

Open transactions has been promising a lot for years now. Work is being done though, but in my opinion painfully slowly :( Open transactions is desperately needed.

Read what Gmaxwell wrote about the for-profit company stuff.
I want that opcode too. They are not alone :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:19:41
It's coming everywhere. Now all other places in the world have a disadvantage, because there's additional uncertainty of when it will happen.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:07:31
Bitpay is more committed to Bitcoin imo. Sponsoring jgarzik, open source projects etc. it's pretty clear which one you should support.
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:18:01
There can be different communities with different aspirations within bitcoin, especially with concepts like sidechains, why is a new scarcity race needed? 
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:09:57
This is very interesting, hope we'll see a confirmation of this. I'd like to see him work on smart contracts.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:27:09
But it doesn't exist yet! /s
@_date: 2016-02-28 06:13:02
Didn't you get the memo? Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg group, so Gavin likely had no choice. /s
@_date: 2016-02-26 10:57:33
It's naive to dismiss it at this point. First it's a rpi2, then suddenly it's embedded in every friggin mobile device. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:17:27
Good night sweet prince.

Big blocker elevator pitch: Have you ever heard about bitcoin's own E = mc^2 law? Market cap is proportional to the square of the number of transactions. That's right, we must increase the block size. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:57:45
Bolt or Mirror?

Bitfury has five full time employees working on lightning. How awesome is that? 
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:05:15
This seems very clever. Would love to hear comments from experts. Also, r/bitcoin seems to ignore the important posts like this. Shame. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:11:52
Are you worried that there is too much speculation hype (providing services only to enter the speculation market) around bitcoin rather than actual real world use?
And that's quite a list of rumours. Hoping some of them will become true.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:24:15
Agree. Why such a shitty tone killerstorm? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:15:04
Great write up. Mastercoin is such a misunderstood concept, and receives very mixed opinions. It's like the Bitcoin early days again.
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:23:07
Also bitcoin has the brightest minds behind it. Money is a social network, and having the best developers and entrepreneurs on board of all cryptocurrencies is a big deal. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:57:40
There is every reason for her to be worried if you base your future financial situation on your bitcoin holdings. Cash out a portion and take the other job.

Welcome to the N.H.K, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:36:18
Good luck with the new exchange!
