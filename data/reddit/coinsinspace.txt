Ok you're right.  
If instead of hashes addresses are public keys, what about making a hash commitment based on a transaction (inputs, outputs, defined order), then multiplying each public key as:  
firstInputPublicKey\*a where a = H(commitment)  
secondInputPublicKey\*H(a+1)  
then summing it all up to obtain a public key, and singing with it. 
edit: with multiparty computation it should allow total aggregation, in the extreme turning a block into list of inputs, outputs and one signature
edit2: ok it's secure under n-cdh


It's something I thought about while commenting on reddit in the middle of the night, not writing a system...

The advantage is that I increase the odds of Bitcoin with big blocks, which would be beneficial to me. It's like seeing an empty bottle on the grass in my neighborhood. If its not too far away I may pick it and throw it into the bin. The individual impact is small, but good change happens when you add many positive individual impacts.

Depends on what client you are using. In general, in bitcoin you don't spend addresses, you spend transaction outputs.  
Every transaction into an address creates (at least) one separate output. So if you got 0.1btc in 5 transactions, you have (almost certainly) 5 outputs. You can concentrate them by creating a transaction that spends them to one output. 
The output can even be the same address they were initially in.  
In newest Electrum there's a tab named 'coins', if not visible, enable in the 'Wallet-&gt;Coins' menu. That's a very clear presentation: every output is separate. That's what you spend. Press ctrl and click to select all outputs you want to spend, then right-click and 'spend'. Enter one of your addresses as recipient, in amount enter '!' which means all. This will create a transaction condensing all these outputs into one.  
It's best to preview the transaction and confirm there's only one output.  
Another clients may have something similar or not. At a minimum, the client should allow you to spend all your coins (some button called 'max' or similar). That would allow you to concentrate all your bitcoins into one output. 
In case of a dumbed-down wallets, it may be easier to import (not: move bitcoins) your addresses into Electrum. You would need to somehow export all private keys from your existing wallets, then in Electrum: create new wallet -&gt;  standard wallet -&gt; use public or private keys -&gt; paste every private key, or open a file with them.

So assuming it's real, how?  
100x60x10 (transactions) x (minimum data per transaction) = 1M bytes (ignoring header). That gives... 16.(6) bytes per transaction. For separate transactions it's not enough for ECC, it would have to be some entirely new asymmetric crypto that gives 128 bits of security for 128 bit keys AND simultaneously allows encoding a new key while signing the old one, all while taking only 128 bits. 0.6 bytes could be enough for transaction amounts I guess, or including them in the key somehow? 
This ignores additional space requirements of current transaction structure, although I guess as a soft-fork you could create one giant transaction with new structure inside. 
More realistic:  
1\. these 100 tps refer to the best case scenario with very large multisigs/lots of inputs with one/few outputs, with each input and/or output being counted as a transaction.   
2\. Or, transactions are like physical coins, ie. each output key owns exactly the same amount. So 100tps would be a maximum possible if all transactions have the same value (like 0.01btc) or a similar limitation. I can see a sublinear aggregation here. 
3\. Or, 100 tps could refer to transactions that cancel itself out in time between blocks, ie. A-&gt;B, then B(unconfirmed)-&gt;C appears on the blockchain as A-&gt;C. Not sure if that complies with the on-chain requirement though. 
4\. A check system, in which relevant data is stored by the participants, and blocks contain only some proof for it. That would probably require the recipient to receive some data over other channels. 
Any other ideas? 


Hmm. Let me guess: all addresses/scripts already exists, so instead of storing it again, their id are used.  
edit2: 


In this case slight change would mean necessity of public key addresses (as opposed to their hashes) to enable signature aggregation. So that fits in with using ids of existing outputs/keys.

No, with exception of installing and initial blockchain sync, the real cost is zero. So I have a node that runs on a pc. Unless I really need that disk space the cost is zero. It just starts automatically and doesn't interfere with anything. 
So what matters is the motivation to set up the thing. Big blocks increase it substantially. 
Setting up separate nodes is a wrong model. 10k people running nodes on their pcs, under different times zones, would create a vastly more resilient network than even a few hundred enthusiasts with dedicated 24/7 nodes. Note that it has an inherent demand scaling: there are more local nodes active when it's daytime.  
In the future bitcoin nodes could rely on smartphones, obviously with option to only use the wifi. 


No, it does provide incentive to run a LN hub. You don't need a full node for that. 


That's client, not protocol. To finance nodes part of fees or coinbase would have to be distributed to them, through some proof of storage.

It's easy to show that PoS is more secure than PoW:  
there's NO possible state of PoW network where it's secure from external actors. A determined nation-state was and always is going to be able to destroy a PoW currency.  
There exists a secure state for PoS:  
as long as the attacker doesn't own ALL coins in one block, a more-valid chain can exist. It's enough to have just one honest stake-owner for every block that is never going to reveal his old keys to the potential attacker. 
That's fundamental. Everything else is an implementation detail.

Yes, BU has problems and is ill-thought out. From a technical point there should be no limit at all, but that may be politically impossible. The worst part of BU is lack of protection against chain fork, especially core fork continuing. I don't expect BU to win but would be happy if it did. 


There's a market, but not a free one, as it's centrally planned. Exactly like government selling taxi medallions. A free market price is always based on true limitations. 


Not true, once you have a ~$500 pc there's nothing better (for bitcoin processing) to buy. Internet access is even more egalitarian for hundreds of millions of people with access to cheap unlimited fiber. While Roger indeed could get a much better connection than you eg. on the Sahara desert - why would you want to run a node on Sahara?


The poor can't actually use bitcoin because block is too small. I am a small time user and nevertheless paid $100+ in fees in the last year. 


Did you mean Lighting Network? Because in reality normal users would *never* be able to settle balances on the blockchain. A signed transaction for ~$100 is worthless if it requires more in fees to actually go through. Which means those with low balances would have to completely trust their hub. Or just not use bitcoin. 
Note that 'low balances' mean 'thousands of dollars' if bitcoin was to be used widely.

If you use an additively homomorphic hash for the public key, you could sign all your inputs once with the sum of inputs' public keys with already used ecdsa. The hash of the used public key would be the sum of hashes of individual keys. Individual public keys can be kept secret. How does that destroy privacy? Outside of case when n-1 keys are revealed, but that's very minor.  
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:59:43


Just like ECDSA. Schnorr doesn't bring any fundamentally new capabilities. It's slightly better in an evolutionary way. 
A hard fork with aggregated ecdsa sig opcode has a very big advantage, because it could support all existing pubkey hash addresses.

That's what 'layer 2' means in practice. The only practical difference to idealized LN is that you can't force a withdrawal on the blockchain.  
Some people seem to genuinely think LN would result in a decentralized system with complicated routing, but why would exchanges accept random small hubs and channels? Why would shops? How would that be compatible with AML? :)  
Exchanges and payment gateways (like bitpay) would form a small tight network amongst themselves and everyone else would be limited to IOUs. LN would be used as a settlement mechanism only between exchanges and payment gateways. 
Trying to sell bitcoins external to that network would get harder and harder: you would have to prove their origin beyond any doubt and explain every transaction. 
That's why it's either on-chain scaling - so that there's no *economic* incentive for centralization (regulation incentive remains) - or another Paypal. The nice thing about scaling is that many possible solutions can at the same time also increase fungibility.

Normal size, they wouldn't. Segwit only works for transactions spending from segwit outputs, that's the main drawback of a softfork. Spending from all old addresses remains unchanged.  
In principle you could add ecdsa aggregation in segwit but that would be nearly pointless, you're already in, use schnorr. 
Well as soon as it appears lol. But I guess segwit getting accepted would means fast subsequent arrival.

Did I make out a *proposal*? No. It's reddit's equivalent of musing on IRC, I didn't even think about how to break it. If I were making a *proposal* I would analyze it first. 
Just putting it in the equation form gives it away, attacker controls everything except publicKey2:  
P = publicKey1 + publicKey2
What about the second one:  
P = a\*publicKey1 + b\*publicKey2  
a = H(publicKey1, publicKey2, other data), same for b  
0 = a\*publicKey1 + b\*publicKey2  
a/b\*publicKey1 = publicKey2  
a/b is a function of H(publicKey1, publicKey2, other data). Safe for H being preimage resistant in the noninteractive case. In the interactive case (the victim signs a valid transaction with attacker-controlled noise), collision resistant. 
given assumption that solving the discrete logarithm problem for P = sum of n-1 attacker keys + unknownKey is infeasible. Attacker keys chosen before knowledge of unknownKey.

This has nothing to do with block size, it's only related to number of inputs in one specific transaction. As long as transaction sizes are unchanged the scaling - with blocksize as a variable - is linear. 
Segwit isn't a good solution to this, because it could be solved way easier in various ways, for example 
by adding one simple hashing script op, to which nobody would object. As a bonus it would also allow signature aggregation, resulting in just one signature regardless of number of inputs and their keys, making transactions much smaller, in fact smaller than Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-18 14:55:30

**Not true. A hardfork only ends in a split if blocks are *rejected* by old nodes.** 
Example: a legacy block with coinbase and a hash of the new block somewhere, perhaps in another transaction for 1 satoshi. New nodes get the new block with all true transactions, almost exactly like segwit. Old nodes accept the block but don't see any non-miner transactions. 
Conclusion: majority hash power can force a hardfork while preventing the existence of any fork. 
It's possible the people you talked to commented on the Classic hardfork approach, not hard forks in general. 
The only real differences between soft forks and hard forks are, assuming best implementations in both cases:  
A hardfork allows a ground-up redesign of a protocol, at the cost of forcing everyone to upgrade. Which also means that all existing outputs get to use the improvements (like an opcode that allows aggregated ecdsa signatures, compressed inputs, ... ). Several simple improvements could easily reduce size of transactions &gt;10x. 
Soft fork only requires nodes and wallets to upgrade if they want to use/understand a new protocol. That's the only advantage. Fundamental protocol redesign is impossible, significantly limiting possible gains, and added features are available only to new transactions, which have to explicitly 'enter' the softfork sphere. 
That's it.
**P. S. The way segwit is done is really inefficient.** All old nodes see is anyone-can-spend, which means an unlimited number of segwit transactions could be bundled into *one* small legacy transaction per block. The way it's done is so wasteful it's almost painful.

If you refer to a miner creating a block with unseen transactions, that's where parallel validation comes in - this means that a block with known transactions is going to propagate &amp; get validated much faster. So either the block gets orphaned or manages to propagate in time. In both cases there's no problem.  
Such miners are guaranteed to be a minority because bitcoin assumes the majority of hash power is not malicious! So there's no additional risk :)

Unless a hard fork at a specified date is certain, BCC is almost certain to be worth more than BCU because BCU is also a bet that a hardfork happens before end of 2017. 
The true market price for BCU would require something that results in no loss or profit with no hardfork. For example you sell one BCU implicitly contained in one BTC for $600. If there's a hardfork before 2018 you get $600 + BCC. If there's no hardfork you get BTC back and the seller gets $600 back.

Adjustable block size is pure free market, if you don't like larger blocks, you can just refuse to accept them indefinitely. If there are miners who think the same they are going to keep mining a smaller chain. 
Users of larger blocks can trivially prevent a deep reorganization, if for some reason a smaller chain got more valid by difficulty alone, by using the invalidateblock command. Or possibly something else, if there's really a demand for such solutions.

Why is a blockchain necessary to distribute data?


It's either an altcoin, a direct competition to ethereum, in which case it has as much to do with bitcoin as any altcoin. However as I understand it, it uses bitcoin as a unit of account, which means trust in that federation is a fundamental part of the protocol.  
Which is why I claim it's *already centralized* and the blockchain part is pointless and wasteful. What's the point of mining? What's the point of making everyone replicate contract execution and store everything? It works much better in a centralized manner: every contract only has to be seen by the interested parties. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:38:30


uh huh. I'm still waiting for any technical argument. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:52:05
I'll try to be impartial:  
**Core** sees increasing costs to run a bitcoin node as the main cause their numbers are decreasing. The same is supposed to be true for miner centralization - the bigger the blocks are, the more advantage there is to mine your own (ie. mined previously by you) chain. Look up selfish mining for related problems.  
All this means that significant scaling on-chain is impossible, so the only viable future for Bitcoin is as a settlement layer for centralized payment providers (but many of them) - LN, and perhaps decentralized sidechains. Basically Bitcoin is supposed to become the interbank transfer layer, with p2p transactions priced out.  
Segwit makes it easier, mainly by fixing transaction malleability issue. It also increases by the block size by amount that's different depending on a transaction. If current usage profile persists and everyone switches to segwit, it would be equivalent to about 0.7MB increase. It also improves on several minor performance-related things. 
From a technical POV, the best way to add Segwit is through a hard-fork. However, Core thinks a hard-fork is very dangerous, so instead Segwit was added as a soft-fork, which allows old nodes to propagate new blocks. From the perspective of old nodes segwit transactions are spendable by everyone, so transactions including them are going to look valid. Miners have to upgrade. 
There's also Mimblewimble project with unknown potential, started by an anonymous guy under French Voldermort's name :) It's unclear what chances, if any, are for its inclusion in bitcoin.  
**Bitcoin Unlimited** believes on-chain scaling is possible and that bitcoin should remain p2p money. Instead of block limits set by developers, block limits are supposed to be dynamic. If you want bigger blocks, you set your node to accept them immediately. Let's say at some point the majority of miners and a significant number of nodes are ok with 4MB blocks. A miner makes a 4MB block, it's accepted by these nodes but rejected by others. However, after the chain with big block grows by several blocks, the node 'changes its mind' and accepts that chain. How many blocks to wait before accepting is another configurable number called 'acceptance depth'. The most common value on the network right now is 4.  
On a technical side, BU is not opposed to hard-forks, which allows much more freedom in adding new capabilities or improving existing ones. 
BU is opposed to Segwit both on technical and political grounds. On technical side there are many in-depth criticisms elsewhere, focusing mostly on the things forced by the soft-fork. On the political side Segwit became a symbol of defiance to Core plans to make Bitcoin into a settlement layer. 
**Fork**. If BU forks off at 75% of mining power, all core nodes are going to reject its blocks. At this point there are three main possibilities.  
1. Remaining miners and economical majority (exchanges, shops, etc) switches to BU and core chain dies. That's the best option for big block supporters. Probably price drop from uncertainty, but afterwards, fees should drop and transaction backlog will disappear, so there's a reasonable potential for an increase.   
2. Core chain slows down for several hours, but near complete lack of acceptance of BU blocks by the economical majority, or some other factors, causes miners to gradually return back. Enormous transaction backlog. A short time later BU fork dies. Price drop from chaos, but later the situation returns to status quo, so price may too.    
3. The worst one. Some important services accept BU, some not. After initial fork some mining power returns to Core, and both forks have comparable hash power. The situation lasts more than a day, which means there are now two bitcoins. Price panic. Both sides blame each other. Hard to say how it could end. 
From a technical side, once BU forks, 1 is the most probable one, 3 the least. Core has the inherent disadvantage because there's going to be an enormous transaction backlog with resulting very high fees, while BU is likely to almost clean mempool with each block, depending on how high the block increase is.

Great, because bitcoin with 100MB blocks allows that. Blockchain storage can be achieved via decentralized storage (through rateless erasure coding). 
Although I don't necessarily agree that full nodes on smartphones are necessary. Storing, sending and computing it is one thing, but just constant *connection* eats battery significantly. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:57:26
Decentralized storage means that n average nodes are required to restore the full blockchain. According to luke jr [there are 50k+ full nodes]( 
If blockchain is split into 200 parts it means that 0.04% of current full nodes are required for a full reconstruction and that storage for an average node grows as if with 0.5MB blocks.  
However, with decentralized storage number of nodes would rise, as that would mean everyone can contribute, even with only few GBs of storage. 
If someone wants to store the full blockchain they could do it for [$4/TB per month]( 100MB blocks mean 5.1TB new data per year which would cost $20.5 per month to store. Compare that to transaction fees paid today, if someone is actually using bitcoin...
Bandwidth requirements are trivial, 100MB per 10 minutes is 170.6kBps, even with 2x overhead that's 341kBps, but 2x overhead is an overestimate. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:00:11


Even if there was a transmission issue, you can have validation servers all around the world, or at least close to other major miners, and send the filled block header to the actual mining place. With that, you could run a big mining operation on 32kBps. 
Which means it's either that updates to validation code are urgently needed, or that the reason for empty blocks is not due to technical limitations. It could be 'technical' in a way that the simplest arrangement has these problems and they don't care to change it. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:53:56
Ok that makes sense
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:26:32
Because for a normal user there's zero incentive other than ideological, it also requires some technical knowledge. Also high fees make supporting core network pretty pointless. Why would an average person run a node for a system he has to pay through the nose to use? One transaction can easily cost more than cost of (in additional electricity) having a node for a year!  
 
I only started running a node once BU gained some traction, zero reason to support Core's expensive network. 
Only miners and large bitcoin using companies actually *need* full nodes. 
Making bitcoin used much more widely is the only way to increase number of nodes. 100MB blocks getting full would mean 100M+ users. Bitcoin would easily be above $100k in that case. That would be enough usage to support things like [multicasting]( blocks globally, which would make all possible bandwidth problems go away. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:48:02
Perhaps, but increasing blocksize doesn't make any attacks worse. Blocksize limit has no direct relation to broadcasted transactions per second or mempool capacity. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:08:19
That's enough for an individual two-chain exchange case, but not for a general peg. For individual exchange you could indeed send coins on the other chain to a jointly crafted address with locktime, then create a bitcoin transaction that unlocks with other party's secret. 
It's not enough for creating that bitcoin transaction before the state on the other chain is known, even in the simplest case you would need to follow the chain of signed transactions. 
Then there's a separate issue about how a bitcoin transaction is supposed to know if the chain it's presented is valid, but that could be made an academic concern with pow chains I guess. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:48:23
You know that this paper uses a completely absurd assumption that nodes *need to* receive an entire block after it's mined? 
The only thing that needs to be propagated is a block header + list of transaction *mempool ids*. Look up [compact blocks]( and [XThin ]( 
"**An average full 1MB block announcement can be reconstructed by the receiving node with a block sketch of 9KB**, plus overhead for each transaction in the block that is not in the receiving node’s mempool. The largest block sketches seen top out at a few bytes north of 20KB."
That's from *Core*. The limits obtained in that paper are *completely irrelevant*. Bandwidth-wise what matters is blocksize divided by time between blocks. 64kBps as a minimum acceptable receiving node bandwidth gets you 32MB blocks easily. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:14:09
It's funny it's here because this article is really more about Core. Neither Classic nor BU created the moronic requirement to use asserts in release, contrary to all sane development practices. That's why that assert remained - it would be ok in all normal projects.  


According to you, but checking invariants in that way is perfectly valid for debug. A form of unit testing.


That assert for new is pointless, but technically new can return null if exceptions are turned off. No word about whether they are.

BU wins: eventually you can pay with bitcoins for bread in Venezuela, where it started to be used by the masses trying to hide their wealth from the socialist government.

You only need one utxo id per transaction. Right now it's 26 bits. Maybe it grows even to 32 bits. So going with that and ~1000x increase that's ~2.5million transactions = 9.7MB. That's why I included 1x overhead for things like that. 


That's related to wasting space, for confirmed inputs there's no reason to include input hashes in actual network packets, it's better to put in utxo id + reference block height and allow everyone to compute txids locally. This turns finding input tx into either O(1) or O(lg utxoSize) operation on a ssd depending on how utxo set is organized. In any case much easier than finding by hash. 
Same with block storage. Actual hashes are necessary only while signing &amp; verifying. 


I agree, no reason to not add aggregated signatures and remove these limits altogether. There would be literally zero reason to use legacy ones so they may as well stay severely limited.

Segwit is designed in an intentionally wasteful way to 'prove' afterwards that on-chain scaling is infeasible; its only real goal was to fix malleability, needed to force everyone to use centralized layer-2 solutions. With a 4MB blocksize 40x scaling was possible, but the only thing segwit gives is about 1.7x...  
A full analysis would result in a full length article, so just one simple example of an intentional waste, from [Segwit's BIP]( 
"[P2WSH's] scriptPubKey occupies 34 bytes, as opposed to 23 bytes of BIP16 P2SH. The increased size improves security against possible collision attacks, as 2^80 work is not infeasible anymore" 
That *sounds* sensible - but why only P2WSH? Because finding collisions for P2(W)PKH requires ECC multiplication, and 2^80 ECC multiplications are infeasible - a method of key stretching. Ok, but... the same could apply to PW2SH! Just treat the SHA256 of a script as a private key, generate the public key and hash that.  
**So either P2(W)PKH addresses are insecure and also need 256 bit hashes, or Segwit is intentionally wasting 14 bytes (per p2wsh tx) for no reason!**  
There's no performance argument because sending 14 bytes across the world is going to take orders of magnitude more time than one ecc multiplication; even loading these 14 bytes from ssd takes more time, it also increases required storage. 
So sadly, it's intentional waste - because it's impossible to not realize all these things during design. They are hard to notice by others though - sort of like underhanded C contest. 
Do you really want people who do things like these to have decision power?

So you want to rely on miners' altruism or what? Trying to herd cats. Mining is amoral. If selfish mining is profitable it's going to happen. It can be hidden by presenting one operation as several independent ones. I would be very surprised if it weren't already the case. 


100MB is 167kBps with cb/xthin/similar. Even if you multiply by 2 for overhead, in 'On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains' they provide the 90th percentile node bandwidth as 378kBps, and that's from 2015. So ~100MB blocks is a very conservative estimate for a point where bandwidth problems start to appear. 
With aggregated signatures and general space optimization that means 1000x on-chain scaling is easy to achieve
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:37:27


Even 36 bits don't change much - 10.73MB, and that's certainly enough. 


I meant that when sending tx you compute its utxo ids say 10 blocks in the past, not utxo ids from blocks its inputs are in. 


Aggregated signatures require just one new script op for ecdsa. The accounting is trivial - is there non-aggregated sig in a transaction? Limits, else no limits. 


Yes, one multiplication, but every transaction is parallel, then every public key multiplication is parallel, but just parallelizing over transactions may be enough.

Ok, but that means blocks always have to be validated fully before extending, so orphan risk is directly related to propagation time, which results in miners seeking optimal blocksize. 


I wrote about average bandwidth, which is what matters for nodes - very slow nodes may get delayed for a moment, but are guaranteed to catch up as long as average bandwidth is low enough. 
High orphan rates are a possible decision of one specific miner, not a general property of the protocol:  


I did in both parts, but explicitly: including non-propagated transactions increases orphan risk by slowing block propagation. So a rational miner wouldn't put a new transaction immediately: either wait a while, or have listening nodes all around the world to verify its propagation. There's some optimal combination of all these variables.  
Anyway it's all too academic, these concerns only really start to matter with 100MB+ blocks.

I like monero for its anonymity and ethereum for constant innovation.  
Monero's ring signatures make it inherently much less scalable. That's one problem, but a pretty important one. 
Regarding ethereum, I'm not convinced there are actual uses for stateful smart contracts. EVM seems to be too weak to do actually useful stuff with high computation cost, but it makes ethereum very complicated and resource-intensive.  
Ethereum is also too centralized: it's hard to imagine darknets using ethereum, whose developers have already proven their capacity to selectively filter&amp;alter ownership. The Ethereum Foundation would eventually get a court order mandating them to freeze selected accounts, and due to DAO event there would be no excuse not to do so. This also applies to other things, perhaps even debt collection! So Ethereum is not a replacement for bitcoin. 
Imo an ideal and practical cryptocurrency would be a hybrid of these three: instead of monero's ring signatures, a much simpler per-block coinjoin with aggregated signatures (so ideally just one per block). Instead of stateful ethereum scripts, turing-complete stateless scripts which would allow instant confirmations &amp; trustless exchange with other coins. So better at scaling than all existing ones, better privacy than bitcoin&amp;ethereum and better scripting than bitcoin&amp;monero. For the same reason it probably wouldn't get much adoption: jack of all trades, master of none. Except scaling, but scaling is only a problem *after* adoption happens... 
A mimblewimble-like solution is another option, but unless something changed it works like a check system: transaction requires the action of the recipient to be committed. This has its own privacy dangers. 
P.S. I also like zcash's zk-snark general solution, but not zcash itself. Making anonymous transactions optional turned them into a coin tumbler with few users.

I don't. The problem with bandwidth occurs if block creation outstrips network's throughput. 'Same time' is blocksize dependent. If a big block manages to propagate it's not a problem anymore. One 20MB block in 20 minutes is as good as two 10MB ones. 
For 10GB blocks the 'same time' is probably infinite. Empty blocks have the fastest validation. It's a monotonically increasing function. There's an optimum somewhere between zero and infinity, which depends on actual technological capability. Parallel validation finds that point stochastically. 


Emphasis on *receive*. Note what happens if they SPV mine: they can only mine empty blocks before full validation as they don't know utxo. But that means that average blocksize gets smaller, decreasing average required bandwidth! A negative feedback loop. The only thing that changes is variance, but bitcoin's design has very wide tolerances here.

I'm involved with Bitcoin since late 2010. I sold everything (except one bitcoin) shortly after etf denial.  
Why: bitcoin was supposed to be an agorist money empowering oppressed people. That means fees close to zero (block reward is more than enough), not &gt;$1, and certainly not centralized off-chain solutions, even if they magically were to become successful. LN in practice would result in a very small centralized network with full KYC/AML and SARs, comprised of Coinbase and similar entities. That's because LN has enormous economies of scale due to frozen deposits &amp; on-chain channel closing.  
"Grey" bitcoins outside of that network would eventually become illegal. 
If lack of scaling was for technical reasons all this would be sad but inevitable, but it isn't. 1MB blocks alone could support 10x more capacity with hardfork improvements. Make blocks 10MB (which means just 16.6kBps of continuous bandwidth to download! [Even Mt. Everest has better internet]( and that's a 100x capacity increase, enough for the next several years. 
The reason I didn't sell in the past is because etf approval would almost certainly create an enormous bubble.

Why not 1TB/s if you're already making ridiculous stuff up? 
The only thing that needs to be propagated is a block header + list of transaction *ids*. Look up [compact blocks]( and [XThin ]( 
"**An average full 1MB block announcement can be reconstructed by the receiving node with a block sketch of 9KB**, plus overhead for each transaction in the block that is not in the receiving node’s mempool. The largest block sketches seen top out at a few bytes north of 20KB."
That's from *Core*. Bandwidth-wise what matters is blocksize divided by time between blocks.  
Even that is slightly inefficient: it uses 48 bit txids, but as of now only 26 bits are required - deterministic utxo id of first input instead, or in-block index for spending unconfirmed txs. That's a 45% saving in space.

Well all this is like $500k-$1M worth of developers' work. Unlikely to happen in the current arrangement. 


Only for old non aggregated ecdsa signatures, the limits are already there. The only sensible use for them is if someone has an old timelocked transaction or otherwise signed tx but not sent. 
All new transactions can use aggregated signatures with no quadratic hashing problem. It's not such a problem for 1MB but 100MB is a different story

So an assert failure in core means a buffer overflow somewhere? That's not an appropriate level to detect these attacks. Are stack canaries enabled? Runtime bounds checking? It's even hardware accelerated on skylake+ (mpx).  
These simple errors are mostly a thing of the past with them and most importantly they keep the code clean. And any exploit that goes past them could also deal with asserts.  In fact if you're really checking for impossible conditions there's a very high probability they are optimized out, or could be in some random gcc version. There were lots of bugs due to that.

LN is actually easy to understand with the right analogy - it's a network of personal (as opposed to bearer) certified checks. It's possible to perfectly emulate expected behavior (ignoring malicious actors, as that requires cryptography) with the following scheme:  
- everyone can create checks, provided that each check is payable only to a specified individual, **and that you set the physical cash needed for that check aside**. Creation of a first check (or pair of them) between two people is equivalent to opening a channel in LN. 
- everyone can unilaterally deposit any check to his name with a delay (equivalent to going to a bank). Unilateral channel closure in LN. 
- to get cash from a check instantly, payee and signer have to cooperate - ie. the signer gives the payee cash. Bilateral channel closure in LN. 
- there's always at most *one* valid check between any two people - the most recent one; all previous are invalid. Updating the channel state in LN.

That 'objective' analysis is completely bogus. They claim 2GB *used* RAM per 1 MB of block size because minimum requirements for running a bitcoin node are 2GB *total* - installed in a PC. Which is off-the-scale absurd. Especially because 8MB blocks were processed recently and didn't use 16GB. 
They base their claims of node bandwidth based on statoshi's node bandwidth use, which is as absurd for three reasons:  
1. Every node downloads everything only once. Which can mean that one node with the fastest upload uploads everything to everyone, or that every node, except the last one, uploads data to another one. If few nodes use most of bandwidth it's because they *can* and have best connections. The only reasonable assumption for average use is one upload and one download.  
They claim **148kB/s for 1 MB = 86MB per block. There's nowhere for that 85MB to go! There's only one 1MB block!**
2. Bandwidth use of a live node includes uploading old blocks, which doesn't impact propagation of new blocks and transactions at all, as they either are or can be prioritized. 
3. All this *doesn't matter* for really big blocks because their existence means bitcoin's use is so widespread as to allow use of multicast, making bandwidth a complete non-issue until 1GB+ blocks. 
In summary, the paper you linked to is so ridiculous it reads like a satire made by a big-block proponent. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:31:19
Latency is only impacted by size if available bandwidth is saturated. So the question is 'what bandwidth is readily available to miners'. The answer is 10Gbps.  


Yeah that's all you need to know whether to listen to them. 
You can physically double any possible bandwidth by doubling the amount of network cables, or lasers, or however you transport data. Magic.

Which I already explained:  
"If few nodes use most of bandwidth it's because they can and have best connections."

@_date: 2017-08-11 04:44:08
It's a textbook black swan because majority dismisses it automatically as impossible, yet it's unlikely but possible, and it would be very likely fatal.  
If bitcoin was the only viable sha256 coin that would be a much smaller danger. In that case the mining power would have to completely disappear for long. It's much more likely if miners can switch, especially if the other chain is more profitable. 
Once that happens there are several factors all accelerating the problem:  
(1) Mining rewards can only be spent after 100 blocks. Normally that's about 17 hours. If 90% of mining power disappeared that would take a week. So that's a strong incentive to mine something else (if available) in itself.  
(2) Bitcoin economy grinds to a halt, as transactions become increasingly impossible. This leads many people with coins on exchanges to buy other coins just to be able to transact, which lowers the price, making the alternative chain even more attractive for miners.  
Which means that, as miners leave, the higher incentive the remaining miners have to also leave. In the event that almost all miners leave the difficulty reset never happens as chain dies. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:51:08


The purpose of one account is to use multiple inputs if fewer aren't enough. So by using one wallet you already assume it's one entity. So eventually all addresses will be revealed in some transaction more or less connected to you.  
You could freeze addresses etc., but that would be just a weird manual way of having a completely separate account. It's also easy to make mistakes. So it's better to use a completely separate entity.

Not to defend the scam that is bitfinex, but $300M in deposits is not a ridiculous sum given the size of the bubble in altcoins. 
Afaik currently the only real source of tethers is withdrawal from bitfinex. So any usdt on poloniex had to come from bitfinex. 
To get usdt, people would have to deposit either (1) coins or (2) dollars from Taiwan. There was a period of depressed btc price which would be compatible with (1). Depressed price increased arbitrage by users and most likely by Bitfinex itself. Most of that arbitrage went to tethers which went mainly to poloniex.

You're right, but your words ring hollow to most as long as the price continues to rise.   
Bitcoin has a maximum price point - or more precisely *average* over a year - but its value is hard to estimate. 657000 bitcoins are mined each year, for the next three years. At $4750, that's $3.12 billion annually. That much has to flow in - ending up nearly 100% as energy cost - to keep the price stable. 
At $475k/BTC - a 100x rise - the world would have to throw in roughly the entire GDP of Denmark to buy energy for Bitcoin mining. Just, no. 
At $47.5k/BTC it's $31.2 billion a year. Which is still absurd - but at least feasible.

It's also true for SPV, an electrum server knows all addresses I have in one wallet, but given how bitcoin works, that's not a real difference.  
If you want reliable privacy you need a completely separate set of addresses + a separate network identity anyway. Not only IP but also packet structure. A separate spv wallet from another pc (like a vps) offers more privacy than a full node on the same computer, and is much easier &amp; faster to set and use.

This is really sad... they're really going to destroy Bitcoin.  
1. is false, because it's easy to create a fork that invalidates another chain via an implicit 51% attack. So there's zero risk of two chains, one wins and that's it. ETC only exist because Vitalik was arrogant enough to think nobody would bother with mining the old chain.   
2. A static system is synonymous with a dead system. It's delusion to think Bitcoin can survive without changes. It only seems entrenched compared to altcoins, but in the grand state of things it's WordStar. It was a dominant word processor for DOS, but it eventually lost to Word, as it turned out there are way more potential new PC users than there were existing ones.  
3. This one probably stems from the fact that most (all?) c-re developers are American and automatically assume USA is best in everything. In fact America has horrible consumer-level internet infrastructure, outside of few projects like Google Fiber. Now even in a third world cities fiber net is very cheap - [$17/month for 200Mbps]( in China. ~$25 for 600/60Mbps in Poland, [~$9/month for 1/0.5Gbps]( in Romania. There are many other examples. Those with slow net and/or data limits should just use SPV clients, possibly over tor. It may well be that running a node in America is feasible only in a few places with fiber net, I don't see how is that a problem.  
Regarding disk space, requiring nodes to use full blockchain is completely unnecessary, as utxo set + ~month of blocks offers equivalent security, as long as state of utxo set (ie. a hash of merkle tree) is included in the blocks. The security is equivalent because if someone hostile has enough power to create a winning &gt;month-old fork bitcoin is worthless anyway.

For those that care even 1GB would be too much, for the rest storage is not an issue. You probably spend more on coffee monthly than what 1TB hdd costs. **I definitely paid more in tx fees in 2016.**
Bandwidth is practically free. 
32 MB blocks require 55kB/s + overhead. I had enough bandwidth for that in 2000, 2Mbps/512Kbps I think. So bandwidth-wise, I guess something like 8MB would be apt for 2000. Obviously storage was much more limiting then.

At best they may decrease the bandwidth load of non-altruistic nodes, but that's valuable only in the very early phase. Mature phase means multicast which would make them completely redundant. At worst, if there's too many of them, they may actually pointlessly increase bandwidth needs of real nodes. 
A pruned node is enough if you are paranoid about a temporary 51% attack. 
If you show up uninvited and start cleaning floor in the supermarket don't get mad when it gets dirty from all actual paying customers.

Already possible. The *only* thing segwit allows is *downloading* that data and knowing it's pow-valid, because it's hashed separately. 


Nope because signature is a fixed part of a normal transaction, but spammers get the full discount. P2WSH spending script is fully discounted and is limited to 3600 bytes (relay policy) or 10k (consensus), required non-discounted data is just a few percent of that.  
So yes, it's a fact that segwit prioritizes spam.

They claim 2GB *used* per 1 MB of block size because minimum requirements for running a bitcoin node are 2GB *total* - installed in a PC. Which is off-the-scale absurd.  
They base their claims of node bandwidth based on  statoshi's node bandwidth use, which is as absurd for three reasons:  
1. Every node downloads everything only once. Which can mean that one node with the fastest upload uploads everything to everyone, or that every node, except the last one, uploads data to another one. If few nodes use most of bandwidth it's because they *can* and have best connections. The only reasonable assumption for average use is one upload and one download. 
2. Bandwidth use of a live node includes uploading old blocks, which doesn't impact propagation of new blocks and transactions at all, as they either are or can be prioritized. 
3. All this *doesn't matter* for really big blocks because their existence means bitcoin's use is so widespread as to allow use of multicast, making bandwidth a complete non-issue until 1GB+ blocks or so. 
In summary, the paper you linked to is so ridiculous it reads like a satire made by a big-block proponent. 


With aggregated signatures (which don't require schnorr) and better data format average transaction can be compressed about 10x. 128MB should be enough for visa scale.

No.  
LN is way too complicated conceptually. I don't mean implementation. User interface can hide *implementation* but not basic functional blocks. Attempts to hide the latter ends in complete disasters like [Microsoft Bob]( or Clippy.  
Funding exhausted payment channels, frozen funds? 'I have 1 bitcoin, why could I send 0.1 instantly an hour ago but now have to wait for confirmations?'. Dealing with hostile counterparties? Forget it.  
The overwhelming majority of bitcoin users already think bitcoins sit at an address, which ends up in a very confusing behavior regarding transaction fees. A good example of a complex technical detail that directly impacts function which makes all attempts at hiding it futile. Most wallets show only addresses in a misguided attempt to make it simpler, which worked only with near-zero fees. 
That complexity is not a LN-specific problem, it seems to be inherent to these technologies.

That's just not possible with one node. If you don't have data making it up is not a substitute.

Parallel validation is the only real fix to performance issues. It means the validation time of a transaction impacts its required fee. In the best possible way, determined by real costs incurred, rather than arbitrary constants, like gas price.  
It doesn't increase resource use (although their implementation may and seems to really suck, based on a shallow look). The fact they they talk about *threads* points to a fundamental misunderstanding. The only new structure you need is a tiny (&lt;1kB) lockless queue.

Technical questions are not resolved by a popularity contest.  
**Did you know that Segwit makes spam over 2 times cheaper than normal transactions?**  
The way segwit works is that bytes used for spending scripts are divided by 4. For simple, N to N non-spammy transactions these scripts contain signatures and there's nothing more to put there - the total discount comes out to about 1.75x. Ie. real total size is divided by 1.75x and that's counted into the 1MB limit.  
No such limit exist for spam, because spending script can be 3600 bytes long (P2WSH), and it's divided by 4 entirely! That's per input. Non discounted overhead required to set that up is 5% *at worst*, making the final discount 3.5x.  
3.5/1.75 = 2.  
**Spam is 2x cheaper than normal Segwit transactions, or equivalently, there's 2x more room for spam than for normal Segwit transactions.**  
It's even worse for non-segwit, current (p2pkh) transactions - spam is 3.5x cheaper!
What do I mean by spam? Storing data purely for storage, like cat pictures. Or dicks. I find the idea of storing a preferentially-discounted dick photo on the blockchain hilarious.  
No sending money for you, have a 2x cheaper-per-byte penis instead.

Only online nodes are reliable. I could easily manufacture hundreds of fake stats by tethering through a mobile connection, different ip each time. Or even accidentally, by going on a train which would result in frequent reconnections. It's entirely possible you are counting one node of one frequent traveler &gt;1000x.


Each connection set is a statistical sample of the true distribution. If on average over 30 days 1% of connected nodes are client X, but they are 10% of supposed nodes, the most likely explanation is you overcount that type 10x, so divide the supposed count by 10.
You can't get true numbers anyway, I can even see node strings on my node you don't have at all ("/Coinscope-GH:0.2/",  "/bitnodes.bitcoin-russia.ru:0.0.1f/"). The only thing you can try to achieve are true proportions.

    nonce = random number
    s = (message+r*privateKey)/nonce

That's the exact same argument used for taxing &amp; limiting CO2 emissions.  
Somehow, bitcoin ended up with wannabe EU bureaucrat in charge. So absurd.

Yeah, any proof of that? I'm pretty sure if you actually did a poll on r/btc users the result would be overwhelmingly negative. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:57:25


That's a completely flawed argument that only makes sense in a world before computers. In fact the exact same calculation problem is solved by every company, scale of the problem proportional to how diverse a company is. 
 
Socialism doesn't work because it perverts the incentive system, innovation, hard work etc. no longer makes any sense. That's it. There's no calculation problem.

They are increasing because block space is fixed. The *absolute* value doesn't matter now, it just has to be high enough to push other transactions out - ie. high *relatively* to other transactions. 
Like a bus with 30 seats, 60 people want in. To get in you have to outbid 30 people, even if that means offering 2 cents compared to their offers of &lt;2 cents.

Genuine new users having problems due to full blocks? Impossible. Clearly Roger's shills are the only possible explanation.

How is that in any way relevant

Maybe not impossible but slow, fortunately gpus solve that.
Just like with mining, cpu just aren't the good tool for the job.

Transaction demand is clearly not infinite - how many transactions do you actually do each day on average? I would guess it's something like 3. It's harder to estimate business transactions, but SWIFT for example only processes [27.45 million]( transactions (I assume that's what these messages are) a day. 
So no, it's not trillions, more like several billions a day. Which sounds big until you realize a typical HD movie contains 4 billion bytes. Efficiently written, 50 billion daily bitcoin transactions are roughly equivalent to 1120 HD movies a day - that's nothing for a planet-wide system and it's feasible today - in ten years it's going to be trivial. I could expand on the calculation if you're interested. 
The problem is with spam, by which I mean data storage - but there are various ways to mitigate that. Litecoin's solution appears to work well at this point. 


There's nothing bad about off-chain scaling in general, unfortunately Lightning Network in particular has horrible centralizing effects, and it's unclear if it can work ever in the most perfect (unrealistic) configuration.

Which is a semi-separate point from


Yet miners ARE 'censoring' and litecoin blocks aren't full. Which means the assumption is empirically false.

Not sure what you're asking... how can bitcoin smart contracts work without a trusted sidechain? Without a very unlikely fork or extremely expensive cryptography, they can't. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:51:10
He did, by showing the basic premise as false. 
Look at litecoin - why aren't blocks full? Miners are free to include as many transactions as they want. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:11:55
Current difficulty comes from the fact that blocks are full - this drags into the front light the existence of utxo (as opposed to common understanding of accounts), mempool and its expiration, fee calculation mechanism (per byte, not per amount as is common elsewhere), convoluted solutions like children-pays-for-parent.  
In the past, average user - that bought from exchanges and paid for things with bitcoins - didn't even have to think about confirmations too much. 
For businesses, before blocks were full 0-conf transactions worked as instant payment for retail - as if you are going to steal, it's way safer to physically take the item, rather than staying in clear view of the store camera, pay, only to later attempt to double spend that. 
It also worked perfectly as payment for on-going services - it's hardly the end of the world if someone gets (at worst) several minutes of free vpn time or whatever.  
Other services were hypothetically vulnerable but usually found that added value from better customer experience greatly outweighs the cost from malicious double spends.  
All that is gone now.

It's a bit (unintentionally) misleading - signature aggregation is possible with ecdsa too, it would require a soft/hard fork to add a new opcode, just like schnorr. 
The main true advantage schnorr has over ecdsa is performance. 
Btw did you know that multisig addresses with ecdsa p2pkh (ie. the simplest most common address) is possible right now, which both saves space and is totally invisible to third parties? The difference is that it requires online signing process (ie. all required cooperate to sign). Online doesn't necessarily mean internet, just communication.

**As opposed to the current situation with mining facilities?**  
**Decentralization has nothing to do with non-mining nodes.**
What happens in the following two scenarios:  
1. ~99% of current miners get nationalized and are turned off.  
2. All relaying nodes disappear. 
Answer:  
1. Bitcoin is dead. That's one block every 16-17 hours.  
2. Nothing really - all node-wallets and SPV wallets connect to nodes set directly by miners, instead of miners' nodes mixed with relay nodes. 
Bitcoin network is composed of *miners*. That's how PoW works. You should read the original whitepaper - "The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.". Node = miner. 
The bitcoin network today doesn't even use the old bitcoin protocol anymore - [miners use special relay networks]( They, collectively, form the bitcoin network.  
Relay and wallet nodes get their blocks *from* the bitcoin network, but they are NOT part of it - they are *users*.

"Signatures are 41 KB"
Way too big when a simple extensible lamport scheme is 16kB + 32 byte public keys. 
Still that's 256 times larger than ecc. Even worse, there's no way to aggregate signatures. 
Other post quantum algorithms are also big.  
So unfortunately, with existing technologies, post-quantum cryptocurrency appears to be infeasible. 
STARKs look very promising however.

It's the rough equivalent of sending a raw bitcoin transaction and forgetting a change address, there were tons of these issues in earlier days.
