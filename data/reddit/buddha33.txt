No point in taking on the deflation argument.  Talking about economic policy is like talking about God.  As soon as you mention the word, people already have a preconceived notion about what it means and no actual discussion ever takes place.  Nobody hears the other side, they just dig and believe harder.  It's not an argument that can be won because nobody actually knows the right answer, they just think they do.  Multiple economic systems are already being modeled with cyrptocurrencies.  The best one will win.

Bitcoin magazine just posted my response to Charles' blog entry.   
While his SF is quite mind bending, I thought his post, by contrast, was poorly researched and extremely unimaginative.  Bitcoin seems to create powerful reactions in people.  The popular stories about it create an opaque fog that seems to block all reasonable discussion.  It's like a mirror where people can see whatever they want to see.  Opponents tend to view it as some kind of conspiracy by Libertarians to take over the world while proponents often see it as a profound tech breakthrough that can change society for the better.  No matter what it is though, if we can't get past the screen on nonsense written about, we'll never get a chance to see its true potential.

You literally can't make the argument without wrecking every other argument you want to make.  People have already decided "deflation is bad" or "deflation is the only true system" and they literally stop listening or reading a single word you say and only hear echoes from their own mind.  It's just like the way many people the feel about God.  To some folks God only said what is in this book and everyone else's book is a lie.  You can't change their minds.  Whole wars have been fought over these two concepts.  It's a losing argument every time.  You get stuck on deflation and never get to raise another point.  It just the way it is.

Jaxx is only suggested for carrying 50 to 100 specifically, not for carrying large sums.  If you can't afford to lose that then yeah probably don't use Jaxx but if you can, ease of use makes it fine for trivial amounts.

Someone didn't buy pizzas with BTC?  How is that not true?  Only thing I can guess is that you seem to be being hella literal here.  OK, he gave the BTC to another Bitcoin forum user who bought the pizzas for him.  But so what?  How does that distort the story?  BTC traded for pizza is the point.

Huh?  Why?
