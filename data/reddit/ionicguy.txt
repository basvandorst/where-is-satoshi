Is that all you can afford?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:09:33
Can you name some recent developments where bitcoin surpasses other coins in term of anything?
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:53:12
Your answer only makes my point stronger. People with such a narrow mindset blindly following a coin that doesn't seem to have ANYTHING to offer vs. other current options.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:33:32
My butthole is steaming up just talking to you
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:52:05
I do own bitcoin and unless you have something to add to the discussion, leave.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:47:25
I understand what a hard fork is but I don't get where the 51% number comes from?
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:24:40
Ok I thought I was missing some sort of joke but now I gotta ask, are you being serious? Were you actually offended that I talked about "clenched ass cheeks"?
It means I was really anticipating, like you clench your ass cheeks when you are at the edge of your seat etc.

Thanks! If you send me bitcoins I will double them!
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:45:29
I did lol.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:30:21
Life without the chance of parole. Doesn't that mean that he never will?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:16:23
And there they will remain, stuck forever, as I lack the remaining bitcoins to free them.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:30:37
THANK YOU
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:08:23
I forgot the trigger warning.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:24:21
You went through my post history to try to find something to insult me with, and all you found was me posting the way my girlfriend eats pizza...?
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:18:56
I didn't know whether I had 1 dollar or a million dollar and I literally had like 1 dollar.
Eternal disappointment is the point of this post.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:24:58


@_date: 2018-01-18 10:08:51
lmao if mods actually delete criticism of bitcoin then I'm selling the second this post gets deleted.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:54:21
Yeah, pretty much all the answers I'm getting here are: "STOP FUD YOU HERETIC".
2 real answers that attempt at answering the question, though, so far.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:15:20
No way while the price is this volatile. No company in their right mind would accept cryptocurrency now.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:13:13
I just opened an email containing my login to Slush's lol. Had forgotten about it. Ass cheeks were clenched when logging in.
[Made a thread.](
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:16:51
It's not happening while crypto prices are this volatile, no matter how many bitcoins 50 cent forgets he has.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:42:31
Yes 4315 btc!
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:54:05
Yeah but they didn't get all 12 btc in one block did they? So they must have had some btc mined before and they never cashed that out?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:23:50
All right my dude, didn't want you misunderstanding anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:54
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:42:36
You do. I wouldn't tell people IRL that you do that, though. I would be legit creeped out if a coworker went this far out of his way to hide his online presence.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:49:14
I invested an amount that I can afford to lose, so for me, I'm just letting it sit there until BTC becomes such a stable currency that you can get paid in bitcoins at work...Or until it falls into oblivion. I never plan to "cash out".
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:27:37
Wont there eventually just be a ridiculously low amount of btc due to people losing some here and there?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:15:12
Want to send to my exodus wallet...4% fee for the super economy?? What. Is that necessary?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:40:48
What are you doing on the internet that requires so much privacy that you go SO far out of your way to make sure nobody can track your actions? To me it is suspect and abnormal. It's like the guy who uses a fake passport to travel. Why does he want to make sure that nobody knows where he is travelling?
I've never understood the obsession with total privacy. I'd rather have cameras everywhere and more security.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:36:09
I have a Simplex payment ID, yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:15:37
I don't have 30 minutes and I don't need an in-depth analysis. Is there a quick TL;DR for those interested but not invested?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:26:11
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:13
Wait they never made a payment before having 12 btc??
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:16:15
All right I would love a recap of the discussion
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:09:06
Yo dude someone needs to give you a reality check. Bitcoin is NOT a retirement fund. It is an absolute gamble, no matter what people here say.
I have bitcoins and I hope for the best but I would NEVER spend money I rely on, on bitcoins and sure as hell not my retirement.
It may be the best thing you ever did or it may be  the WORST. You could lose it all if bitcoin turns out to be a bubble and the fact is, NOBODY knows at this point but if anything, everything says it IS a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:22:48
So does bitcoin.com wallet. How on earth do people daytrade BTC if the fees are like 50 bucks for a transaction under an hour?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:52:10
Is there a guide on how to convert my online wallet to paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:14:52
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:05:27
How long will it take with 100 sat/byte?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:47:27
That's strange. Don't you need to transfer the btc  from a wallet to another on gdax? Because that would incur fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:24:44
Ye i learned that later
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:45:11
And this is why I hate investing in btc. I have to because there's too much hype around it but at the same time I've never felt like I'm investing in something that could go wrong in so many different ways.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:15:04
Ah so this was a solo miner who got a block, but didn't have a deposit address assigned so the BTC was never deposited anywhere?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:00:09
How do you daytrade BTC? Aren't the fees way too high for that?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:22:45
How would lightning network affect miners? Would it put them out of business?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:03:52
You're joking lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:34:04
The fees are lower the lower the sat/byte is I see. So it's like under 1% at 100 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:55:44
Yeah..They literally just appeared right now...Weird.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:02:55
What the fuck are you doing on the internet that requires a VPN paid by bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:00:56


This kills the redditor.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:01:43
The cake, it takes.
