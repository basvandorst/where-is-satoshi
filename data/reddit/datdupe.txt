Google Scrypt asic dude.... You just have to use an ASIC for Scrypt instead of sha256.  Love the downvotes

LTC isn't asic resistant :) Not sure why this thought seems to be spreading

I Dont think r/bit coin has the healthiest community, but how is it a bigger circlejerk than doge?  One mention of doge and you get a circle jerk comment storm "so much wow' etc.  That's the biggest turn off to me about dogecoin, I Dont find that funny or amusing at all.
Maybe that's just me though

If it's on your computer you have control of the keys.  If it's on Coinbase, you have no control at all.  Take your pick

Charlie, LTC, BTC : best friends forever

Litecoin is part of bitcoins scaling solution
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:11:25
Research layer 2 scaling, atomic swaps, and the lightening network

Coinbase jan 1 is for withdraw only, its not supported by coinbase.  Increasing block size isnt a scaling solution, itos kicking the can down the road
keep it real m8

Maybe they meant your phone dies but a key does not
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:24:47
keys are already dying by way of keyless entry doorpads at least

lol such bullshit
some of us took some profits off the table and are now holding because, as as been said before, crypto is volatile and this is the way it goes
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:49:07
lol sure

Sure - so the vast majority of people fail when trying to time the market.  Ive been a hodler since 2013 and have seen my fair share of panic like this, and made out great - this is why its such a common strategy in almost any investment market.
If you want to play the game of trying to time markets thats fine, and yes, some people do very well with that.  That being said, plenty of people lose out trying to time markets as well - its easy to act like its the right decision at a time like this.
Different strategies for different people.  Like I said, I hold because i believe in fundamentals, and i shave profits during rallies to keep my pockets fat.  All it takes is one "Sell everything, buy back in lower" strat to fail for you to end up behind - just see people who sold to buy back in with BTC at $30

oh great another obituary

What defection though?  He's always supported both and sees LTC as a more fluid testing ground for features before they go to BTC
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:02:14
Not true at all.  Extremely successful people have diversified sources of income, usually more than 5.
Unless you're talking about learning multiple skills or trades at once?

Charlie has always been pro bitcoin.  What do you mean by "Even Charlie"?
The hate he gets on this sub doesnt make any sense tbh

Reminds me of a thread I just saw in the litecoin subreddit offering 25 ltc (&lt;$50) to design a site along with all the assets.  I love to work on projects but you can't expect someone to do a substantial part of the work, give them 50 bucks, and then ride into the sunset

Really? Based on your language you're probably not old enough to vote

I've been signed up for this for about a month, excited to get started
