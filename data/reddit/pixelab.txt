not much, 25k. But that's not the point, they should reimburse customers instead of paying their bills with our money. I'm just expressing my anger here but as soon as I had the mail I understood that the STR were irremediably lost
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:15:46
Hahaha, funny guy. On one hand, they are honest guys, on the other hand they are stealing their users, but that's normal they were baaaaaaaad users. LOL !!
Depends on the perspective !
Thank you for blaming the victims btw.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:18:57
Looks really scammy !
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:08:15
We're not talking about ripple. Thank you !
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:48:32
I was a satisfied customer until today. Now they try to erase the STR/XRP debt (due to their own negligence) by blaming a "Bank" and making the satisfied custmomers pay for their mistake (the tfPartialPayment was know since a long time)
You could easily replace Justcoin by Mtgox and STR/XRP by BTC... Same story again and again.
@_date: 2014-10-31 10:05:03
Because they have, proof is there.
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:52:24
To begin with, I suggest reimburse XRP / STR users they took funds from
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:36:03
Might be the announcement of a Counterparty issued asset !
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:54:52
The truth is that they were running on fractional reserve since the tfPartialPayment hack affecting STR/XRP (know issue that they could have avoided) and they are now closing shop and using users funds to erase their debts (see proof in my downvoted post below) The whole "Bank" issue is just a pretext.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:47:02
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:34:53
Thank you for asking the right questions. IMHO the "Bank" issue is a lie.

AKCoinDigger ! Thx !!!
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:18:11
Ok, my bad, didn't knew that my balance was frozen.
Hack was their mistakes. When I make a mistake I pay for it, I don't make the victim pay for it twice.
But, it's not the real world right ? Just fun and games with internet fuckin money.
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:36:12
Justcoin took the risk, now they stole my coins. Mark K was a BTC problem ?
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:10:16
Overstock stealth project... exciting !
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:13:27
Justcoin was hacked 2/3 weeks ago and now they are closing shop. They are using users funds to cover the hack losses.
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:37:11
nice analogy

Hello Gavin, thx for your time and your work !
I'll keep the question simple : Do you think OP_RETURN max size will be increased to 80 bytes in the future ?
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:27:09
Great video!
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:20:31
lol, can't say it better. It's cringeworthy though.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:24:57
It always works well until they run with your money !
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:37:23
It's funny because a paragraph is missing in this post !
From their mail :


Also you'll notice that they've removed their own profile images from their about page.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:00:49
Thanks, insightful !
@_date: 2014-10-07 09:18:42

As long as they have my funds in custody, they are responsible for it.
On the other hand, why do you think the most common excuse for exchange closure is "we have been hacked" &amp; "funds have been stolen"?
Besides, I've read somwhere that the funds were restored by the hacker... who knows.. justcoin maybe ? Have they commmunicated about it ? NO
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:50:26
Yeah, I complained here (a bit rude I admit) and all I had was :
* Answers like "You should not trade altcoin to begin with" or "You shouldn't have held alts on an exchange"
* Massive downvoting
* ppl telling me that what I was saying was wrong (despite proof)
* etc

Yeah downvote me fuckin Buttcoin morons. Another outright SCAM ! open your eyes !!
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:52:01
hats off for leaving with users money !... no, it's not "coincidential" at all... LMAO
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:14:19
Truth being downvoted here !
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:07:36
Thank you. Blaming the victim again... What's the point of central exchanges if you can't even let a small amount of money on them overnight ?
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:45:46
Yeah, but they are denying it and blaming the "Bank"
They're filthier than the traditional banks.
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:14:20
Fair enough...
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:06:23
Wise words. Too many are buying things without understanding. I bought my first BTC when I understood how it worked under the hood. I was mind blown.
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:15:42
Do you plan to restore the balances of XRP &amp; STR that the previous Justcoin has mystriously "wiped" ?
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:16:00
Congratulations Robby/Xnova !!
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:26:15
Indeed !
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:40:37
Yup, regulated in Panama ! Really helpful if they run with the money :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:13:06
What's you plan about the missing STR and XRP ? Do you plan to pay you debt or do you think using your customers money to cover your losses is acceptable ?
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:52:09
Looking forward to it too!
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:06:24
You fucking crooks !! Stealing your users funds !!


proof 
BTC ecosystem is becoming more disgusting everyday.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:44:59
Maybe you would be shocked and pissed by Justcoin attitude if you had all the information. Maybe this nice little "Bank" story is just a red herring...
It's so easy to get away by blaming traditional banking in this sub !
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:54:26
WTF ! You stole STR from my balance ? Because you don't have a bank anymore ? What's the link between the two ?
Crook !
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:11:44
go gamble it all on 
or invest (reverse gambling ;)
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:05:30
JustCoin is part of the BTC ecosystem. JustCoin make their users pay for their mistake.... what is it that you don't understand ?
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:49:38
The problem is not with bitcoins, the probelm is with STR/XRP.
Or maybe you know it and you just want to bash antoher victim, aren't you ?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:07:53
Assuming a stable difficulty, what's the USD/kwh where you won't be profitable anymore ?

You run a mining operation and can't give us a simple number ?
No I can't run the numbers myself because obviously I don't have the Wattage you use every month to run 50TH

You said AMA, I asked a simple question.
Don't make an AMA if you don't want to answer simple questions.

Balances were never forzen. If your news are their "communication" then you are just a puppet repeating their lies.
