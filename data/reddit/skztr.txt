Then what's it about?
My understanding of the claim is:
 "People say that no one will spend Bitcoin because it is better to hold onto it: Tomorrow it will be worth more. However, people already spend dollars on computers, even though they know that tomorrow their dollars would be worth more (computers) Tomorrow"
Please correct me if you disagree with my interpretation of the claim, and ignore the subsequent points.
I'm saying that the above ignores two things:
 1. that people very much *do* delay buying technology products, in anticipation of what's coming tomorrow. (to rephrase in the context of the discussion: People *do* delay buying certain things with dollars, knowing that their dollars will be worth more tomorrow)
 2. that it's not just "Any computer I bought tomorrow would be worth more than any computer I bought today", but also "the computer I bought yesterday and currently use is rapidly losing utility" (ie: people have an additional incentive to buy today, which does not necessarily apply when discussing a currency gaining value compared to all things, as opposed to gaining value compared to a specific thing)

1) It hasn't stopped technology from becoming extremely successful, but the key point is the value of dollars, not the value of technology, and this argument isn't relevant to the value of either (which is my point)
2) Do you have statistics to back that up? "My Wife's iPhone works fine for the apps she uses" and "My Wife needed a new phone because the apps she used all upgraded until they no-longer fit on the phone she used to have" are both anecdotes.
Making purchases and technology recommendations for businesses, I can tell you that most of those purchases were delayed until far beyond the point of obsolescence, no product was ever purchased near the end of its product-life-cycle, due to the anticipation of a newer product coming along, and most purchases of "fancy new phones" coincided with the older models either no-longer working, or no-longer being available when the previous devices broke.
Though I have just seen the migration of the majority of an office to Ubuntu in order to allow older machines to be kept, this is both an aberration when compared to my previous experiences, and yet another example of delaying a technology upgrade as long as possible.
These are also my personal anecdotes, and so will not convince anybody. I don't claim to have statistics on the matter, and I suspect any statistics would be skewed in my favour by people who intentionally damage their phones in order to get an upgrade from one source or another. ie: I wouldn't necessarily trust them if they seemed to agree with my assertions.

Bitcoin is still deflationary even if it doesn't become increasingly adopted. The number of spendable bitcoins, over time, tends towards zero. Hard drives will fail, keys will be lost, passwords will be forgotten, people will die and simply neglect to mention a stash of bitcoins in their will.
Bitcoin would be deflationary even if only two people ever used it.

code isn't contributed automatically, and almost never anonymously. If you submit code to my project, everyone else on the project is going to read the code, line-by-line, looking not only for bugs, but for poor implementation. Hidden exploits may not be obvious, but if they don't look like security holes, they may still look like they're "not the best way to go about things", which is likely to get your patch kicked back to you. Especially if you're not already a well-known member of the project.
What you should be more concerned with is a project which is run by malicious people, not the intents of random contributors.
If you're concerned, things you can do are: evaluate the code and commit log. You don't need to be able to understand everything / spot the bugs. Just read through enough to understand a few red flags which might get you and idea of how good the standards are, which will give you an idea of how well contributions are reviewed / contributors are vetted, prior to accepting work.
In general, avoid using the latest version of anything unless you are participating in development. That helps to reduce the risk.
Also in general, if you don't trust a project which shows you all the code, gives you a complete list of all contributions and all contributors... why in all hell would you ever trust a project which *doesn't* do that?

That's *Valve* never seeing the difference. Consumers would still be able to see the difference.
Currently, Valve can say: "Let them pay with £7 if they're in the UK, and $3 if they're in the US", and they can get away with it because it's hard to move dollars and pounds around, so it's hard to say "Buy this game for me with your dollars, because I'm getting ripped off. I'll pay you back"
With Bitcoins, it's harder to say "Let them pay with £7 worth of Bitcoins in the UK, and $3 worth of Bitcoins in the US".
Let me say that again:
To ask Valve to accept Bitcoins, along with their current practices of 1) charging different prices in different regions, and 2) allowing users to trade games with each-other, you are asking them to say: (using dollar signs as a consistent unit only)
"If you are in the U.K., pay us $10. If you are in the UK, pay us $5. Do this using magic internet money that can be sent to anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost. In exchange, you will receive a product which can be sent to anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost."
This is what they are trying to avoid. Their concern isn't receiving the *same* money over time. Their concern is that they want to receive *different* money depending on location.

It's posts like this which tell me the "real" value of bitcoin is currently hovering around zero. Value is determined not by how much people say a thing is worth, but by how much someone is willing to exchange the thing for.
We can ignore the majority of people who are buying and selling bitcoins for dollars, as these people are playing the market, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it has little to do with what things are actually worth to a man on the street.
We can ignore most companies who "accept bitcoins" when they actually accept dollars, but have a deal with another company which handles bitcoins for them. (ie: transactions where the bitcoins never even land anywhere)
Then there are the stories of bitcoins being used by themselves:
  - Man receives $50,000 for holding up a sign
  - Man receives $2000 for posting a comment on reddit
  - Man receives $500 to "prove a point" (I'm still not sure what point)
How much do we actually value holding up a sign?
How much do we actually value posting a comment?
How much do we actually value the opinion of someone on a WoW forum?
The only point proven here is that you value your money little enough that you're willing to send a chunk of it to a random forum-poster in exchange for nothing.

please be aware that two MP3s of the same song will almost always have different hashes, and the same goes for anything else, including two text files of the same book, etc. This is because the tiniest difference in the files (say, a different ID3 tag, adding a comma within a sentence, beginning a file with a UTF-8 byte-order mark, etc) will, by design, result in a completely different hash.

Computers really are a horrible comparison. "Computers" gain over time, but "A computer" loses over time.

I understand the intended goal, but handing something that one actually values at $500 to what amounts to a random stranger on the off-chance that they might become interested in it is something which *does not happen*.
When handing out a $500 gift certificate in order to promote something, one generally either goes through a screening process to ensure you're handing out to the "right person", or does something to entice people to become interested prior to handing out the money.

I am saying only that this person is not acting like someone who believes the thing he transferred is worth $500.

I have all my money in Pounds right now. Many people have all their money in dollars. Is that foolish? I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency.
The problem isn't people having all their money in "Bitcoin". People who have all their money in Bitcoin are doing fine.
People who have all their money in "random number on a website, that puts the word "bitcoin" next to the number"; or, "a single digital wallet" are doing no better and no worse than those who have all their money in "a random number on a website, that puts the word "dollar" next to the number" or all their dollars in "a single physical wallet".
Dollars are valuable to people,. and so they treat them with care.
The people who are losing "all their money" didn't treat the money with as much care as they would for dollars, or do not understand the amount of care which they implicitly treat their dollars with by using only FDIC insured banks, etc.

No, I don't trust myself. This is why I store my money in a bank. I don't trust myself to secure my money in a way which is both safe against theft, and safe against losing access to it myself, or (in case I die), my family.
Instead, I outsource this very complicated requirement to a trusted business which not only has been doing this sort of thing for hundreds of years, but which is also is insured by the government in case it all goes under (not that businesses a large as this one actually ever truly "go away", they simply fizzle out and need to sell off their assets, assets like customer accounts. If the bank fails without my account being bought, it would be a crisis big enough that government assistance would be unlikely to help)
I think Bitcoin is a very interesting system, and I think it has a chance at being a very good currency... but for fuck's sake, banks serve an important function. Handling this sort of thing yourself is pointlessly dangerous. It is not up to each individual person to become a security expert.

Unless I misunderstand which example you're referencing, I don't think it "went over my head" so much as "does not align with my experiences as an I.T. professional".
To simplify things: Yes, people *want* new computers/phones, but not many people would buy an iPhone 7 one month before an iPhone 8 comes out: They know their dollar will buy more in three days time, so they hold on to it. They do this either with the knowledge that they can buy the fancier thing if they wait a bit longer, or, like me, with the knowledge that they can buy the "old one" for less as soon as the "new one" is released.
Please be aware: I don't think that Bitcoin being deflationary is a serious economic problem (though I think entropy in general may be a serious long-term problem, I don't think of it in economic terms).
I just think the comparison with "the value of a dollar if looked at only in relation to the purchase of technology products" is a poor one.

In short: yes, but it also depends on your definition of "anonymous".
Someone unknown to a group of developers is more likely to have their code scrutinized. If you're trusted, then your code may not be scrutinized. You may not be able to associate a name with a physical person, but if you can associate a contribution with a trusted identity, that in my mind would be "non-anonymous", even if you can't track someone down with a baseball bat.
On the other hand, if you're concerned about a sophisticated attack by someone who has the time and resources to set up a history of trusted development history associated with a disposable pseudonymous identity, then it would be simple enough to set of a false physical counterpart to that identity anyway. In short: it is harder to fake a history of trust than it is to fake a physical identity, so if your definition of anonymity is "someone whose fingerprints I don't have", then your security is already compromised.

But consumers in regions which get shafted *would* choose to pay in Bitcoin, by asking friends in other countries to buy the games for them, for less; then, trading the games on Steam. Result: Valve gets less money
Bitcoin isn't something which would be bad for consumers.
Valve wants to satisfy big-name publishers by offering them the feature of "Charge different amounts in different regions".
Valve wants to satisfy gamers by offering them the feature of "Trade games with each-other"

People will buy things so long as "doing something" is more valuable to them than "the perceived potential for doing something later". A deflationary currency shifts the boundary between those two potentials. It is our shared assertion that other things would impact the placement of that boundary *more* than the intrinsic deflationary nature of Bitcoin would. We disagree that "people want to use computers now, despite Moore's law telling them that things will get better" is a good proxy for the situation being discussed.

You can't just block off a segment of transactions, pick the parts which seem to agree with your theory, and ignore the rest. People buy computers when they do, and they hold off on buying computers, very often because they know they can get more for their dollar if they wait.

Think about this from Valve's perspective: They are already in the business of selling a commodity which varies in value from region to region, you're asking them to support, as payment, *another* commodity which varies in value from region to region.
You can't just say "Well, 1 mBTC costs £1, so give me 7 mBTC for this game. Coinbase, please handle this." at the same time as you say "Well, 1 mBTC costs $1, so give me 3 mBTC for this game. Coinbase, please handle this."
While Coinbase hides the risk from the seller, it does *not* hide the BTC cost from the buyer. People are more-likely to complain if they need to spend different amounts in the *same* currency, than needing to spend different amounts in different currencies. It wouldn't just generate complaints, but as BTC is so much easier to move around than other currencies, people could easily pay the lowest price by buying from a friend in another part of the world.
Valve wants to make sure people don't notice they're being charged two different prices for the same game based on where they live, because that is incompatible with the system they have set up to allow people to trade games with each-other.

Actually serious. If you understand how bitcoin works, you understand at least the basic premise of trustless distributed systems which can still agree about token ownership. If you don't, then I can try to explain.
A distributed "steam-like" system could, for example, involve the exchange of specific tokens (something which, afaik is *not* possible with Bitcoin, but which *is* possible with various proposed alternatives to Bitcoin / extensions to Bitcoin).
In such a system, a "token" could be used to track a right-to-play. If you own the private key of the public key which most-recently signed the token on the blockchain, that could be used as proof that you have the right to play a specific game. That token could be used as part of a signed request to download from another distributed (think gnutella, not bitcoin, in this case) network (though the content distribution network would likely need to operate in a trusted manner, it could rely on the security of the trustless network). The token could similarly be used during the sign-on for multiplayer servers.
actors within the trustless system would of course have the ability to sign the token to mark it variously, even if they are not the owner (eg: "I hold this private key, and I say that this token is invalid due to cheating").
I just don't see the opportunity for fraud. Perhaps you can give an example?

(serious question) Do you know anything about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:19:01
Bitcoin isn't a bank, though. So targeting "the world's unbanked" is basically saying: "Hey, I know you prefer to keep your money under your mattress. What if I said that I could offer you a fireproof mattress that you can safely tell your neighbours about the existence of, without fear of getting robbed? For free?"

Put your bitcoins somewhere secure, like a bank

Where are each of those keys?

The problem is: Passwords are an inherently flawed system. They rely on humans to either:
- generate them (they will generate them poorly)
- and/or remember them (they will forget them if they are any good / generated by something other than a person)
- and/or store them securely (they will lose them, or store them on a post-it note taped to their monitor)
You can use a machine to generate secure passwords, but that makes them hard to remember.
You can outsource the secure storage of the passwords, but then you need some other method of authentication in order to access those passwords, so this just shifts the problem. The only way out is to outsource the generation and storage of passwords, and to unlock those passwords via some method other than mere passwords.
That's why I think that anyone talking about the importance of "using good passwords" is doing more harm than good.

Well, I need to transfer money for the specific purpose of paying U.S. taxes, so there's that.
About once a year I ask if Bitcoin could help with this process, and so far I've always been told either "Not yet" or "Not ever"
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:44:54
but isn't all of the current delay in wire transfers due to regulatory checks, etc?
It's not like they're putting a stack of money on a plane and flying it over every time you make a transfer. This stuff is handled via the internet already.

Can I use bitcoin to send USD to a person in the United States *without* requiring that the recipient subject themselves to a cavity search?

You still need to take the common currency in order to sell things.

Because when something goes wrong with a Fiat bank, either the transactions are reversed, or government-mandated (and often supplied) insurance kicks in. If things go really, seriously bad, the government itself can step in and make more money available by loaning out "new" money.

They are taking the ability to "send" bitcoins to someone else.
"send" in this context means: grant the ability to "send" bitcoins to someone else.
This is recursive, ie:
The ability to {grant the ability to {grant the ability to {grant the ability to....}}} to someone else.

According to the Big Mac Index, Bitcoin is worthless

would you put money into a bank that didn't have insurance against theft?
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:24:38
Then what exactly do you mean by "stable", if you're not talking about buying power? That's my point: If you stop looking at stability as a dollar-value, and look at it only in terms of how many actual bitcoins people are willing to exchange for something (without taking dollars into account), then the question of "stability" looks a lot more like the questions you'd normally ask yourself when buying any other item, and your perspective on what counts as "stable" will change.

How exactly does bitcoin remove the necessity of banks? If I were holding my entire savings in bitcoins instead of pounds, I'd still want to find a trustworthy entity to:
 - protect my assets under lock and key
 - insure my assets against fraud, fire, and theft
 - invest my petty assets safely enough that I could receive a guaranteed (though &gt; 0) return
 - ensure speedy transactions, without fees
 - transfer my assets to next-of-kin in the event of my demise
These are all actions which are complex enough that I'll still want to hire something that I would call a bank to do them. My personal bank charges me nothing to do all of the above, and my business account charges me much less than I would pay to manage it all myself (mostly thinking of the cost of backups).
International transfers are a sticking point, but I expect that isn't what people tend to be complaining about.

  - Where will you put your cold storage? Someplace secure, someplace that will give only authorised parties access, someplace that will be insured against fire and theft, taking the value of the stored money into account. I call that place a "bank".
  - complaining about inflation is a strike against other currencies in general, not against banks. Ignoring the high inflation rate, and taking into account only that it exists, money with a return on investment is better than money in a mattress, no matter how low the return. Remember that the proposed alternative in a straight "banks vs no-banks" scenario is: inflation still exists, but now you receive no benefit from it.
  - I bought groceries a few minutes ago. I was able to give money to the other person within seconds. Our respective banks ensured that the transaction would go through, and that if it didn't (eventually) go through, I would need to pay a fee in exchange for a temporary loan. This allowed me to leave the store instantly, rather than waiting a week for everything to clear. That is a valuable service.
  - Leaving your bitcoin to next of kin without a third party being involved subverts the security of the wallet just as much as leaving all your money in a mattress. Leaving *anything* to next of kin without a third party being involved is risky. Not insanely risky in all cases, but risky enough that third parties are usually a good idea to ensure the ins and outs of who is intended to get what are all in order, and that things transition smoothly. This is one of the things which banks are involved in.

no VPN or anything. Is it actually  that you can't access, or some related service / sub-page of it? I am unfamiliar with that site, but I can access the home page just fine.
I'm in the southeast, and as far as I'm aware it's just regular Sky Broadband (bundled with TV I never watch anymore)

You're looking at it the wrong way: think of bitcoin as a unit of exchange, not as Internet Fun Bucks to be exchanged for other currencies.
Eventually, you will go to a store and see the price listed in bitcoin, and people are willing to exchange bitcoins for goods because they are also able to purchase other goods with bitcoins.
Last week I saw a TV for £800, now the same TV costs nearly £1000! Does this mean that the value of pounds is unstable, or the value of TVs? The answer is really a mix of both: they're each only worth what someone thinks they can get for them, and that amount fluctuates all the time, and always will.
