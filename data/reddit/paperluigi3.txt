I'm a Kansan, and I remember hearing about that. Good job on making headlines!
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:49:38
I didn't mean it literally, but okay.
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:27:36
Oh, that makes sense. I think I get it know. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:24:58
I don't know, this actually makes sense. It seems like Mt. Gox is trying to take itself out of the race, and they missed the opportunity to keep as many BTC in circulation as they can.

It takes one user to change a lightbulb. Though if the lightbulb belongs to Mt. Gox, you'll need a court order to see the lightbulb, and a gun to get to it.

...how did he get your address? I'm probably missing some context.

Where's Silk Road when you need them!
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:39:03
Put me down for not caring. I know people who are part of that mine.

How do you feel about gun control?

Do you have a rough idea of how much processing Ghash has?

I love you. Thank you so much.

He does. Make this guy a mod.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:44:17
184 Billion BTC? I haven't heard of that,  what happened? 
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:10:23
Oh! I see!
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:34:03
The *block* market
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:43:14
Dammit. Now we're probably going to have a dip in BTC price.
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:35:51
I'm screening this for evidence.
EDIT: By screening I mean screenshotting.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:27:27
Thanks. That's pretty interesting.

Brintey Spears = Miley Cyrus before it was cool?
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:00:17
hey its me ur brother
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:54:51
I see.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:54:30
I don't mean bubble in the traditional sense, more that one small act can ruin the price. (i.e. China being dicks and telling their banks no-no to Bitcoin) I guess what I'm asking is, "How likely is it that in the near future, someone could say something that causes BTC to go down?"
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:55:46
Thank you. That's the answer I needed.
