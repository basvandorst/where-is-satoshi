I accept that there is no central authority in theory. I understand that. 
But it seems naive to suggest that there aren't other forms of political power which influence support one way or the other.

Fair. I think I referred to core devs to liberally, sorry about that. I'm struggling to accept there isn't a source of coercive power one way or the other though. It seems naive to think otherwise. 
Your solution of not using it yet does seem rational, but the value of BTC will be determined by whether the majority of holders feel the same way as you. And this seems unlikely to me, since the perceived value of BTC is largely comprised by its potential to complete transactions online, without the intervention of a bank. 
But maybe others will also be willing to wait for a solution.

Can you help, because I'm really trying here. Are you saying that it's not all up to core, and that the resistance to implementation of changes came from the community as a whole? If so, I accept that. But surely there has to be a source of coercive power influencing these decisions one way or the other? Even if that power is merely political

I just want to clarify and say I believe in BTC, and held on to a significant amount through all the forks and disagreements about BTC's future. But also I'm not a fundamentalist, and believe BTC's value will ultimately be linked to its utility.

Would it not be better to give into alleged fraud and manipulation than stick with a version which is evidently becoming functionally impotent? If transactions are taking &gt;12hrs, we can never hope for BTC to become anything but a speculative bubble.

So we'd prefer something which has little to no use value because transactions are impractically slow or prohibitively expensive?

A lot of users have been warning of these problems with BTC, and the response on this sub has been that it's propaganda or just people trying to stage a BTC coup. Well, now you're sitting waiting hours for your transactions to be confirmed. And the moderators of this sub are probably going to ban me for this comment.

If you hold BTC now, you'll hold both coins after the fork, which increases your opportunities for decision making to ensure you benefit from the fork as much as you can. 
Have you thought about buying bitcoin cash?

If you don't understand how ratio invalidates any claims you're trying to make, you shouldn't be trading ;)

It's exactly because of the competition in hash power that it might be worthwhile to look at investing in alt coins for the next few weeks. 


Explain your reasoning for thinking this?
