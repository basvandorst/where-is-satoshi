Are you psychic?  If not, I would advise against this strategy.

Most come back to the fact that your comparing bitcoins to a credit card (even talking about fees from carrying a balance and getting approved). You also fail to include the negative aspects of bitcoin (volatility,  difficulty to acquire, learning curve, lack of widespread merchant acceptance, lack of transaction insurance,  etc.) It's just very one-sided and not objective. A better comparison would be btc to debit/paper money.

I gave up on it a few times back when it was like $10 because it was just too complicated/time consuming. It wasn't until my need for them (online gambling) was great enough for me to jump through the hoops that I actually bought some. For this reason most people aren't going to adopt into it unless they really need to (drugs, gambling,  money laundering etc) THAT is the future of the coin. Not as a replacement for day to day transactions.

Silver - rising use in the technology and solar energy industries, almost tapped out surplus stockpiles,  fixed cost to produce,  low entry price,  numismatic price gains and it's shiny and fun to play with.  Join us at @_date: 2014-09-16 21:42:52


Agreed. Most people are too lazy and technologically illiterate for btc (not accusing you, just stating).

That's why you buy different size coins dummy

Inconsistency, volatility,  the nature of man to want to sell during a dive to prevent loosing everything and buy during an incline to get in on the profits, transaction fees (a big one), constantly worrying about the market at all hours of the day and night.  I tried to make money with your same strategy but was constantly stressed and ended up loosing more money in fees than I would have made if I just let them sit until I eventually sold all of them. I bought in at like 600 watched them soar to over a grand and sold for like 800 but at that point I lost so much day trading that I  basically broke even. Also there are people running bots that watch/place the buy/sell orders and basically manipulate the market on a daily basis so any dips or inclines are made so rapidly that it's difficult to get any "meat off the bone".

That's what I do. Coinbase just creates a new wallet which is tied to your account. I like the added convenience of their site and the ability to reset my password if I forget it. I have mine set up with mobile authentication so it texts a unique number to log in and if any login requests come from a new IP I also need to verify by email so I believe it to be adequately secure. The disadvantage is that you are trusting Coinbase with your wallet and after what happened to mtgox most would advise against that. I only deal with a couple hundred dollars in btc though. For anything you wouldn't be comfortable losing you should probably move it to your blockchain wallet but be sure to remember the address/keys. 
In any case,  you will likely use Coinbase to purchase/sell the coins before transferring them to your personal wallet.

Reminds me of the people putting their child's tuition into beanie babies back in the day. Look how that turned out.

Agreed but the same comparisons can be made between paypal/debit cards and credit cards. You make it seem like credit cards and bitcoins are the only solutions to a cashless society/online purchases. The main advantages of a credit card (when used correctly) are to build credit and earn rewards. I just got my first credit card a month ago and received a $70 sign up bonus (received instantly). I routed my subscriptions/monthly charges to it so now I am earning 1-2% and building credit in the process.  The card is tied to an automatic monthly payment from my bank account so there is no risk of getting hit with any fees or interest. Since the monthly subscriptions were already budgeted there's no additional spending costs either.

Added cost to launder money.

This is quite possibly the dumbest bitcoin related article I have read. Way too many idiotic points to take the time to refute but why not compare Bitcoins to a debit/prepayed debit account/card to begin with?

Is always filled with this many scammers?
