thats retarded, just hodl.. Thats what made people millionaires with bitcoin.. Its not related to understanding it, just being part of something bigger and trying new things. Most sceptics as you who first wanted to understand bitcoin before getting into it never made a dollar.

Not all BTC is for sale, so he could only buy parts of it, and it would make the price RISR

pretty interesting question (in the title). I would think its more profitable to mine gold but only if you know how and where. It requires relatively low investments and you have no running costs other than your time, and physical work. You would not get far with bitcoin mining unless you have mining hardware etc. With gold basically you just need a pickaxe/sandfilter and a good spot.
  
I would love to do some physical work after working at computers for so many years.
  
Well, and if you do invest a ton of money in bitcoin mining hardware, and can get a good deal on electricity,then its actually more profitable i guess.

Now? The china stuff is basically a lot of rumours. It started as china banning ICOs which wasnt true in the first place. They just want to bring regulations to counter scam ICOs. Now its kind a panic where people think China will ban bitcoin, based on very few sayings by Exchanges and chinese officials - that werent even named. So I expect this all to clear up soon and trust coming back in china.

I believe I just saw that video. She asked Hillary Clinton about the Haiti Funds, about Seth Rich. And then asked Huma Abedin why she stayed with her husband. That btw is a question that could also be directed at Hillary but for Fake news it was always more interesting what Trump SAID over what Clintons have actually DONE.

Interestingly, there was a study that showed these cash limits actually do not fight the black market but actually enhance it as people lose trust in governments.

That is the master of retard sayings. First of all the market has changed. Back in the day when Bitcoin started it was the first and there wasnt a 1000 different coins. Obviously, if there is 1000 coins instead of 1, or 10, not all of these coins will ever gain any value.But some will. And already did so. Many became millionaires with for example NEO. So yes, some research is good. But making "understanding an investment" the priority is just plain dumb because everybody understands things differently. Has different priorities and thought patterns. So if you are into Bitcoin, if you want to look at successful people, you would look at people who became rich with coins and look at what THEY did. How they see and look at the markets. How usually the strategy is just to buy early and HOLD. How many did never buy Bitcoin because they never understood it? So you are saying thats a wise choice? Come on thats retarded you gotta admit.

The china news is fake and so is your hope of bitcoin falling more. It will be $4000 by monday and more because the only real china news still is that they want to regulate scam ICOs. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:42:36
i can tell you why its at $3500 already again because I just sold some at an ATM when it was $3000^^
  
Hope it keeps going up tho still have many more to hold. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:19:30
Do you really think anyone believes bankers ? LOL..... Its ONLY about china. Then again some people DID believe the lying media about Hillary Clinton, but thats another story. Bitcoin holders will not believe bankers.

when i grew up in some EU country we loved the simpsons and fully supported how evil foxnews is. But times have changed. Now you usually can get a way better picture of the current happenings from foxnews than from cnn, wp, nyt. I mean i check the latter 3 too but usually they just will try to push some hit-piece on trump.... But i agree its actually quite difficult to get a reliable, good news source when 99% of us media is openly for hillary clinton, and often even has deep relationships with her. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:02:56
Nah its good just as with the JP Morgan news. What does not kill us makes us stronger. See Press, establishment praising Hillary Clinton? People arent dumb and dont believe them anymore. Majority still wanted Trump same with Bitcoin. It will influence a few weak minded individuals maybe but in the long term - Bitcoin will profit. As any marketing genius knows even bad news is good news, the important thing is people talk about you.

From the years 2014-2016 you could also think bitcoin might stay at $4000 now for 3 years but with the additional PR bitcoin keeps getting, the many uses it has, new investors jumping in constantly, thats just so unlikely. So this is all just speculation I see 0 base for your patterns if you are not trolling. I mean its been risen 1% a day this year on average, so still can go $7000 or more by the end of the year and not in 2026. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:33:43
Woooah more of the fake reuters news ? WTF but i guess its no suprise this jokepaper also said hillary clinton would win and LIED about all her crimes to influence stupid voters.

I actually find it much easier to buy things with BTC online than with Paypal. And I have done it like 5 or 6 times in the last few weeks. The only bummer was when the fee became so high. Before I always used Paypal now when I got the chance I rather use BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:28:57
The majority did vote for Trump. You need to look into voter fraud, like all the dead people who voted for democrats. There is millions of fake votes for democrats and there is even leading democrats confirming that tho obviously the media will not report on it as it does not fit their agenda just like Bitcoin. And still Trump won despite 99%(!!!!) of media was against him and openly ENDORSED Hillary Clinton. But I apologize,I did not want to turn this into a huge political discusson, I just do see similarities to Bitcoin. 
  
edit: Thanks for the downvotes, it just proofs how brainwashed people are by the media, not just about bitcoin!

Or maybe you are misled by the alt left news media?! Who really knows. But Bitcoin clearly is the underdog here and so was Trump. I do strongly believe Bitcoin will keep rising because the better idea, better product always should win.

Its still just china. The drop is already bigger than what the chinese account for in bitcoin. Even if china REALLY bans ICOs completely its all in :)

The panic is already in the drop. Its just china. And Bitcoin even still fully works in China. So price can only go up if you sell now you will pay $4900 tomorrow mark my words.

I suspect thats why so many people get confused they need to show their ID, proof of residence when buying bitcoin for the first time on the big exchanges :) 
  
The press needs to cater to their banking advertisers and lobbyists. Its all fakenews. Not just with Trump.
