Yikes, can anybody elaborate on the validity of this data? This is saying at least one operation (hut8) spends $2,334 usd to mine one bitcoin. If this is similar for each miner then the price is likely heading down far further. Is that a fair statement?
@_date: 2014-11-22 07:24:23
What is 796 buying? and is there a youtube video explaining all the data shown on bitcoinwisdom? I don't use it that much. I've been using bitcoinity the most.

(copy and paste from below but still from the heart!) Hey Excited, thanks for the feedback. I am just throwing this out there. Do you happen to know any web developers that are looking for a project that is Bitcoin related? I do feel strongly about SatoshiVoting but I have a feeling I am not technical enough to move it forward as fast as it should be. I know it sounds cocky, but I think something like satoshivoting, or satoshivoting itself, is one of the killer apps of Bitcoin. Massive crowd funding from around the world on a monthly basis. I think that's a big deal :). Do you happen to know anyone?
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:12:45
 , I just launched it 2 days ago (extreme example of a minimum viable product). Any feedback welcome. We already have some funders, which is cool.

I think it's important to note that one use case is also a store of value that is better than a lot of fiat currencies out there. If it becomes a preferred choice in one country, chances are....well, things could spread quite nicely. Yes, right now, like all technologies, there isn't a huge use case for everyone.... yet.

when they first priced it, the cost was 100$ equivalent. I imagine that they got so many orders which they couldn't fill, so during the price rise, they just left it until they get version 1 in order. Once the next order cycle comes, they will price it again.

The newly mined coins cost money to mine, similar to how gold cost money to mine. This is what people mean when they say bitcoin is a more fair form of money; and in a lot of instances, it's what they mean when they say it's deflationary.

You might already have these two questions from when I asked for the AMA, but I wanted to make sure they were here :)
1) When do you project you'll be able reduce the price of a Trezor to the range of 20-40$? (given incoming competition, and you actually want to make some money from all that effort, contradicting stuff)
2) Will you make it so I can store other digitally scarce tokens that represent ownership of a company through whatever technology for a distributed stock exchange evolves out of this gong show?..... in the Trezor?
EDIT: add one :)
3) Would you guys be able to make a coinmap4rent.org site? for landlords/property owners/commercial developers/and even home owners that want to rent their property for bitcoin? (something completely identical to coinmap.org, but just focused on a place to live).
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:00:23
It's not really inflation since the mining industry has to spend electricity to get the new bitcoin. As an aggregate the industry spends more to mine the bitcoin than the current exchange rate. So it's very un-similar to government printing of money where it doesn't cost them anything. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 02:37:30
This is a really good comment. Litecoin just doesn't have the infrastructure, users, mining industry, longer history, faith of millions etc etc yet; which means it's not as good as a form of money since you can't transact with as many people. So, if Litecoin is not a better form of money, than why would they start only using that one?

@_date: 2014-02-21 03:36:29
You sound very angry. I do agree that we don't know which one will scale, but I am pretty sure one will eventually, and Bitcoin is clearly in the lead. Which bags the question, why would any other crypto succeed over Bitcoin when it can just adopt those features? I think we have been through this already.....either way, I am impartial when it comes to which deflationary crypto scales, just that one does. I think it'll be a pretty awesome world in that scenario.

I completely agree with this. Hands down wish they would focus on building one cryptocurrency economy vs confusing people with two or more. Know any company that wants to use their open source software and start making a Bitcoin only hardware wallet identical to theirs? We could just tell them they will get hordes of money to start mass producing them for cheap. Although, once TREZOR sees people funding a competitor, then switches their stance to only Bitcoin, I would start funding them again. They have put in a ton of R&amp;D and I love what they are doing.

@_date: 2014-02-08 20:23:08
As weird as it might be. If the price of Bitcoin keeps rising because governments inflate the prices of electricity which inflates the mining costs of Bitcoin which ultimately rises the value of Bitcoin on exchanges (albeit slowly) , then people will want to store their value in Bitcoin. Of course they won't understand that, they'll just keep hearing about friends making money and they will eventually give up and buy some. Not sure how it will all go down but that is pretty much the first reason to buy bitcoin, the next ones are the no bank fees and no transaction fees. Then the speculative nature of it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:29:19
Agreed. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. I wish it was a lot better than it is, but we felt it had to be put out there asap. I'll message Gavin and see if he can send me some info to list the team.

Hmmm. 6 months ago there were maybe 2 million people that new about Bitcoin and now there's probably 2 million that own some. Right now there is probably 25 million people that know about Bitcoin and in 6 months from now..... That is my guess. I know it looks dangerous now, but the numbers are still in favor of Bitcoin succeeding.

@_date: 2014-08-11 20:22:15
Just came back and saw all the replies. Not a lot of fans I see. The reason this site is a good idea is because bitcoin is a community based movement. Everyone talks about the risks or leap of faith that we already know exist. This site would just give companies an easy way to figure out if there are some employees willing to take that leap of faith with them. Nothing more, nothing less. The difficulties work them selves out after the early adopters take the risk. If you build it, I'll be one of the first to list myself on there.
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:38:45
oh, and the volatility (gut churning years) that early adopters experience while building all the tools to make the currency useful is not worth any reward?

1DGAD, that interview was the most horrible representation and obvious slam piece of bitcoin I have ever seen. It wasn't even about your brother-in-law at all. A few clips that didn't even go with what they were saying. The reporters should be liable, but I don't think they'll pay up. Are you crowd funding to make up for the damages? (mind you, that would be a hard campaign to pitch, maybe do it in a fun way if at alllll possible. :) ) 
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:42:50
I've thought about this scenario as well and I do think it's important to consider. It's too unpredicatable/far away to dedicate a large amount of time to it, but it's good to identify it as a possibility.
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:12:40
Is there anyway to verify this information? I would imagine it's difficult for mining operations that are not profitable to be selling Bitcoin. Since if they are not profitable they would probably "hang on" so that they can one day sell at a price that is profitable. Or is a portion of the mining industry not subject to this graph?: 
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:50:52
I would say the most needed infrastructure is a 20-30$ hardware wallet. Currently we have TREZOR at 100$ and BFL Bitsafe at 150$
Trezor: 
Bitsafe: 
If you can do anything at all to help those two initiatives reach a 20-30$ price point, that would be the next wave of adoption.

Hello Bitcoin community,
We would like to introduce, what we believe to be, the first approach to fill an unmet need in the Bitcoin space. For Bitcoin to succeed as a financial system, it has to be better in EVERY single way compared to the previous financial system. One thing that Bitcoin has not yet developed, is the ability to "create jobs" in a way that is akin but enormously better and more powerful than how governments "create jobs". The video below explains our first approach to how we might do this:
 (please watch the video, then continue reading!)
As described in the video, the ability to print money enables a government to force us to pay for items on their agenda. The items on their agenda are often not the same as the ones on citizens agenda. We hope that by sharing this project we can spark a conversation of how we might create jobs in a far more democratic and efficient way than governments ever could.
If you like what we are trying to build, please start casting your monthly vote. Our goal for posting this is to either get good feedback or create our first job. Creating our first job should be relatively easy since their are probably about 5,000+ people that visit this sub everyday. That's more than enough "votes" to create a job. Once one is created, we are pretty sure things will take care of itself.
Thank you all for your feedback.
With that said, let the notes begin:
- 1) We know the site is EXTREMELY basic. We felt it was important to just launch asap and get feedback from as many people as possible.
- 2) We only have one campaign listed because we needed a global organization, of somewhat common interest, that already takes Bitcoin. It turned out, there were not many of those. We are sorry, that putting a freaking Mars Mission as the first campaign continues to feed the sterotype of crazy Bitcoiners. The next campaign will be an environmental campaign or a Bitcoin related piece of infrastructure.
- 3) As soon as we can, we will devise a voting process for what campaigns should be listed. For now, we are hand picking reputable organizations.
- 4) The "campaign by 2" method is only a first approach. I am sure it'll take a long time to find the right way to reach consensus.
- 5) If you're a graphics designer or web developer interested in the project, message me. We are looking for exactly 1 of each, that's probably all we need for a while.
- 6) If you have any organizations that you think would benefit from this type of crowd funding, let us know. Remember, it's common interest, project based, job creation that we are focusing on. We are trying not to list ongoing charities, instead we want to create jobs that have a well defined end goal: infrastructure, technology, space programs, and whatever else people want to build and develop.

terrorists no, but people who they suspect could be evading tax even though they are not....bitcoin users. If they know anything about bitcoin, they know they can't tell the difference between a law abiding citizen in the bitcoin world and one that is not. It's incredibly difficult to do this, near impossible. If they do, they ruin the frangibility of bitcoin, a fundamental property of good money. If that happens the price of this amazing deflationary currency goes down, which they would love to see. Infiltrating, even in a nice way, is something they would have the motivation to do just to find out more. Sorry for the tin hat moment, but that's particularly true.

1) I fully understand how shorting works, but not how swaps work. I've read a bit about swaps, but I am not sure how you can profit from a declining bitcoin price using a swap, are you able to explain that?
2) The first graph of that page has a green line representing "USD Swaps". Does that line indicate how much short interest there is? and if so, does the current amount of 27million equate to a percentage of bitcoin out there used for shorting?

He's constantly looking at solutions like the proposed market based transaction fee (not sure if that's what he calls it) update instead of  arbitrarily fixed fee. You could also, for now, use coinbase for some transactions. Anything above 1 mBTC they pay the transaction fee.

Hi Elan96, I believe I have been working on what you are looking for: [satoshivoting.com/how]( . Watch the first video on that page then come back to read the rest of this reply.
As you can tell, I just have an initial demo up. I was going to launch with just one campaign but I have realized a few things in the process and know what needs to be done next. I am currently in contact with the Bitcoin Core Devs and working on getting them to list a campaign but I am looking for two more campaigns. This campaign is a fantastic idea. I would need a few things to list on the site:
1. a dedicated Bitcoin address.
2. a introduction video explaining some key items.
3. an initial document outlining a first months/year budget and any other major details. This document doesn't need to be complicated.
4. a completion date or goal. (in this case, the completion of the audit.)
I believe a full professional audit of openSSL would make a great campaign. Good campaigns have certain characteristics to them (as I have quickly learned from mistakes so far) and this campaign is definitely one of the good ones.
If you have time, message me your contact info and maybe we can talk more about listing this for our initial launch. Our initial launch will happen when we have 3 quality campaigns. And we have a graphics update to do as well. But, the campaigns are pretty much the most important pieces. We need 3 that are good.

Well, I am constantly looking for a more technical cofounder, but I can't wait on people so I've hired a web dev company for now and Iam overseeing the design. That should speed things up. It'll be posted here when it's actually launched. What's up now was just to get peoples opinions; which went pretty darn good.
Again: If you know of any good web devs, let them know. With more adoption the need to create jobs in this manner is critical for society. IMO

Hey pizzaface18,
Thank you for commenting and we are very happy to hear that the idea was actually clear enough and that you liked it :). You have a very good point. The first campaign is pretty ambitious. We are ok with starting with that just to show people what we are aiming for long term (the future is our oyster if this crowd funding method grows), but I think you're right; for practical purposes we should start listing what the community needs asap. Bitcoin exchange auditor is a great idea.
I think I'll start to address the Bitcoin foundation and see what they think of the idea and we can develop it from there. 
I greatly appreciate the feedback.

Thanks for taking a look at the previous posts. I've made some dumb posts, but feel I am on point with most :). I completely agree with you. Now that you point it out, there are other companies that are better to support. Do you know of any hardware wallet companies that might be willing to pursue these goals? Maybe if you can get in touch with Erik Voorhees he will definitely like this discourse, and know someone. I feel this fundraising method can NOT be understated. Once implemented, the fierceness of development would be astounding.

You don't need to specifically set a threshold on the address. You could just have a note at the counter: "Any Bitcoin purchase over 100$ needs to wait for 1 confirmation. We will change this policy as the technology progresses."; Something like that should suffice and I am sure all people involved will be willing wait.

You might already have these two questions from when I asked for the AMA, but I wanted to make sure they were here :)
1) When do you project you'll be able reduce the price of a Trezor to the range of 20-40$? (given incoming competition, and you actually want to make some money from all that effort, contradicting stuff)
2) Will you make it so I can store other digitally scarce tokens that represent ownership of a company through whatever technology for a distributed stock exchange evolves out of this gong show?..... in the Trezor?
EDIT: add one :)
3) Would you guys be able to make a coinmap4rent.org site? for landlords/property owners/commercial developers/and even home owners that want to rent their property for bitcoin? (something completely identical to coinmap.org, but just focused on a place to live).
Also, if you can please still answer these questions even though I am late that would be great! If they have already been answered then I'll find them here!

True that banks offer those services, but Trezor and it's next versions will enable us to loan money to eachother without a middle man, and invest in eachother without a middle man. We can hold the private keys to all assets in a Trezor like device. So, wouldn't that mean we are our own banks? Since we would be loaning money to eachother?

Hi Amanda, I am not sure how much you know about bitcoin, but I made this video for friends and family where I link to all the best educational videos available (IMO 8 months ago :) ) . Here it is:  . 
Hopefully this helps you learn what bitcoin is all about. As you learn, you'll come to understand why all the bitcoin meetups are uncomfortable for girls. Bitcoin is not just an amazing once in a centurty computer science breakthrough. It's a change in money and money gives people power/freedom/status/resources; all things that wars have been fought over in the past. A lot of times (read: every damn time) men have been the ones fighting for those things in those wars, while women tend to avoid those sorts of environments. 
So, as much as people may not want to admit, this very nature is what is present at bitcoin meetups and might be making you, (and any person who doesn't understand bitcoin) uncomfortable. Now, that's not to say bitcoin meetups will always be like this, but for it's initial steps into society, it's probably going to be a little awkward. The best thing for you to do (and anybody else for that matter) is to understand more about bitcoin, and you'll be better off. Good luck, and I am pretty sure you'll be financially comfortable no matter what happens to bitcoin, because you're right, blockchain technology is 'whats going on'.
Quick Edit: Sorry about painting such an intense picture about the space. It is the truth! but these downvotes make me realize I should also include that bitcoin will do more good for human kind than we can even imagine. I think it's only fair that I mention that.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:28:08
That's a really good point about the .00 at the end of bits making it familiar for people. I think that is a contributing factor coupled with just having 1,000,000 Bit's in a Bitcoin. It's just a familiar round number instead of 100,000,000 satoshi's in a bitcoin. But you're right that efficiency wise satoshi's are probably best.
You do bring some good points, I am all for either one. I guess I've just slowly gravitated towards Bit's.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:07:23
I am pretty sure there will be systems for chargebacks(escrow), loans, and mortgages. Not for a while though. Ethereum will probably be a great platform for using such tools. Also, you don't have to pay 2x the price, you just buy some Bitcoin to use the value transfer network. You're smart enough to know your argument here is very week. And finally, Why would I use Bitcoin over another network? Because it's more widely used. If everyone buys groceries with Bitcoin, then you have to buy groceries with Bitcoin. Also, you said there is no reason to use a more expensive (it's not, like I said you just buy smaller amounts) limited supply over a cheaper, unlimited supply.....that is where you are definitely wrong. the store of value aspect of Bitcoin is the foundation of this whole thing. The fact that nobody can inflate your time, cheat you out of the most valuable resource in the world, is the whole point. If it was abundant, it wouldn't be a good form of money. You should view this video to see what makes a good form of money:  watch the 2nd video in the series "What is the Bitcoin". That will show you the attributes of money and explain them in depth. 
Hope that helps!

Hey Mojenko, thanks for the feedback. I am just throwing this out there. Do you happen to know any web developers that are looking for a project that is Bitcoin related? I do feel strongly about SatoshiVoting but I have a feeling I am not technical enough to move it forward as fast as it should be. I know it sounds cocky, but I think something like satoshivoting, or satoshivoting itself, is one of the killer apps of Bitcoin. Massive crowd funding from around the world on a monthly basis. I think that's a big deal :). Do you happen to know anyone?

@_date: 2019-12-21 10:35:10
I believe it means a payment can be split up and sent over multiple routes at the same time instead of trying to squeeze a payment through one route with potentially limiting capacity. Ultimately this will make it so we can send larger transactions over the lightning network than previously possible.

Great work. An iOS lightning wallet can't come soon enough. I love bitcoin as is, but being able to make it useable as a currency for day to day usage will help it tackle the much larger market that is currency instead of the much smaller market that is store of value. (of course all that is arguable in many ways, but hopefully you get the idea). People don't want a currency that they can't buy food with.

You're obviously a veteran and sick of these questions. I am only a 7 month'er, but as you probably have experienced, this will not slow down. Maybe find something you can copy and paste?:
Hi there! It's definitely weird the first time you hear about bitcoin and continue to investigate. You will feel a bit disoriented at first, and then when all the puzzle pieces come together, you say to yourself "Satoshi, you goddamn genius!" Some sources of info that I learned from are as follows:
- Watch these Khan Academy videos as an amazing introduction: 
- Watch these cryptography videos to become more comfortable with the technology used to create bitcoin's security: 
- Watch this speech by Erik Voorhees on the significance of bitcoin. If you know anything about the money system or economics you'll be able to relate, and it's a good lesson even if you don't: 
After that, what is left is actually to buy a bit and store your private keys in cold storage or any other method that you deem safe. Places to buy include:   and 
One more thing: Once you know all of that stuff, you will hopefully conclude that bitcoin's success is currently being determined by its adoption by merchants. Some maps to track this progress are  and  "Success" of bitcoins is subjective. In this case I am defining success as: I can use it everywhere to buy things.

Your not really better off paying with fiat. The value of a currency is derived from the number of transactions in it's network and measure those transactions in purchasing power volume(USD for now). So if you want your BTC to be worth something someday, it's better to spend what you need to spend and save what you can, just like you do with fiat. Except this is better to do both in :).

1. Their both fundamental improvements in a given tool that a society uses; Built up from first principles using today's technologies.
2. The map shows close to 130 places in the US? if you look at mercadobitcoin.com you can see Spain specifically and the density of places accepting BTC is far greater. As expected, places with shittier fiscal management have faster adoption.
Again, could be wrong or right, doesn't matter. As long as more places accept BTC as a form of payment, it's all good :). And ya, they will pay taxes like everyone else, that's easy to overcome.

If this is true, even with the difficulty increase and hash rate increase this seems like it's still a problem. Around that speech the hash rate was 30000 GH/s and now it's (for the sake of simplicity) 600,000 GH/s. So even with a 20x increase that still means 20 22-year-old kids with asics can take down the network. :) Do you by chance know the cost of all the chips he was holding?

You should try to do the future value calculation of bitcoins, then you'll decide whether to buy or sell properly.

The reason Bitcoin is more marketable to men is because men study money, control of power, computer science, Math, Cryptography, and finance a lot more than women. That's why you see men with a background in those subjects adopt Bitcoin first. I do agree that Bitcoin will be fine without rebranding, but it sure as hell could of been easier if it sounded like something people wanted, even without having the background knowledge.

I am not sure if you'll see 250-300 again, maybe just buy small amounts now and buy larger amounts if it keeps going down. or buy larger amounts if it keeps going up. And remember to spend them whenever you can! coinmap will help you with that!
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:00:34
Copy and paste from a previous answer:
I have 8 different cold storage paper wallets at home each with small amounts. Then I also back up those private keys a 2nd time by writing them down on a piece of paper that I carry with me folded in my wallet. (Just incase house burns or something retarded like that.) Then for daily purchases I use Coinbase - my "transaction" wallet. Whenever I run out I either buy more or use the ones I have in cold storage. Since I have done this I haven't ever felt worried about losing them. When I just had the single paper wallets I would worry a tiny though, so the 2nd paper backups that I carry helped a ton. Hope that helps.....hardware wallets will be a god send when they come into the picture. Remember to spend lots! The restaurant I just went to has had 1500$ worth of BTC used at their location, I was very encouraged to hear that, glad people are spending them where they can.

Coinbase is my favorite because it forces you to buy gradually. You only can buy 10ish per day. It would take you 1-12 days to accumulate 100 BTC, if they don't flag your account as suspicious. In which case, just send them a message and they'll fix that.

Hey jonygone! Glad someone commented here. The video explains that the central bank prints money then buys bonds with it.....aka lends it to the government. So that means the government is now in debt to someone who just printed money. So the "we" are people who pay taxes which goes to pay debt to people who printed money. I swear to god I have to be wrong about this because that just doesn't make sense. Why do our taxes go to people printing money?

Very cool question. Begin bold predictions:
I most definitely don't think bitcoins will be lent out by any decently savy individual in the near future because the risk of default as the price rises unexpectedly is enormous. I do think some people are silly enough to give bitcoin loans and take bitcoin loans. So I am sure it will happen. 
I think loans will continue to be given in fiat until the price of a bitcoin is astronomically bigger then it is now and it starts to flatten out and become stable (like super fucken stable). If the majority of the people on the planet are using bitcoins then I think you could figure out the deflation rate. At that point people and companies can at least estimate the appropriate interest rate to charge. I mention people because I am guessing peer-peer lending will be much more dominant in a bitcoin world, no middle man required, no spread taken by banks, you lend at 3% and borrowers pay at 3.1%. Platforms like prosper.com and lendingclub.com would become insanely popular. It is then that a market determined rate will be discovered because (just like today) lending money will be a profitable business and hanging onto money just to gain 1% in purchasing power will get you fuck all in life, so you'll either invest it or lend it. I am not sure how every detail will be hashed out, but I think it would need to be hashed out and therefore will. 
How does one lend in a world where money holds it's value and everyday we store more value in it causing deflation? 
If in the still highly unlikely scenario that bitcoin replaces most forms of money(fiat&amp;gold) and the deflation rate is (say) 1%. Then one would just lend money at a market determined rate just like they do today(debatable) minus today's inflation rate of 3% and minus the deflation rate since a lender already makes that. 
Soo you want a mortgage in our fiat world and qualify for a rate of 6%? In a bitcoin world that mortgage would be 2%(6-3-1=2). So the lender is increasing their purchasing power by 3% because they are choosing not to spend that money but instead lend it. You pretty much have the same system, and fractional reserve banking will exist in some form, except we don't get punished by losing 3% per year for saving money. If you every want to get ahead you will have to lend out that money or invest it, because a 1% increase in purchasing power will get you fuck all. 
I'll probably be back to edit this as I find mistakes and people bash it :). This is a very good subject! Good thread.

Hey Stick!
Did you want to still keep the counter up? It's really nice to see that as a measurement for merchant adoption. If not it's all good. :) Cheers.

I copy and paste this every now and again. It will most definitely help you understand bitcoin at a better level then most people and doesn't take terribly long. You don't have to watch all the videos to use bitcoin effectively, but it helps. Also at the bottom is a map of all merchants that accept bitcoin for real world goods. 
Hi there! It's definitely weird the first time you hear about bitcoin and continue to investigate. You will feel a bit disoriented at first, and then when all the puzzle pieces come together, you say to yourself "Satoshi, you goddamn genius!" Some sources of info that I learned from are as follows:
- Watch these Khan Academy videos as an amazing introduction: 
- Watch these cryptography videos to become more comfortable with the technology used to create bitcoin's security: 
- Watch this speech by Erik Voorhees on the significance of bitcoin. If you know anything about the money system or economics you'll be able to relate, and it's a good lesson even if you don't: 
After that, what is left is to buy a bit and keep your private keys in cold storage. Also make sure you learn about change addresses so you don't lose money in those! Places to buy include coinbase.com, btce, canadianbitcoins.com(canada), theres a list of places somewhere. And then you can start spending them and start saving them :)
One more thing: Once you know all of that stuff, you will hopefully conclude that bitcoin's success is currently being determined by its merchant adoption. Some maps to track this progress are  travel.bitcoin, and mercadobitcoin.com.

Just to phone up the owner or go in person and ask if the Bitcoin community can send money to the QR code at random. Have the owner instruct the employees to check it every once in a while, then give out a free sub accordingly. The proof part is a little bit harder though, especially to keep it convenient.....going on trust would probably be the best, but hell, there's trust needed in all of this.
EDIT: obviously it would also be best, if the employee working would tell the customer "you just got a free sub from the internet, through Bitcoin"

Good call. If it shot up to 700 I might consider selling a very small portion of my BTC savings, but other than that I ain't selling nothing. :) As long as  keeps growing, BTC is my new savings account. Always good to be ready I guess.

It's fun to hypothesize but gathering relevant data is better. It's not really about what you think, it's about what is happening. To determine this you can track brick and mortar adoption. Use maps like coinmap.org, travel.bitcoin, etc. For example: 
Coinmap.org 








Track the amount and watch the growth. I was pleasently surprised recently when I saw a winery from my home town (Kelowna, BC, Canada) now accepting bitcoin!!
I do agree however that it will be a challenge, I am looking at coinbase.com to be at the forefront of "making it easy" for the masses.

SolarIce should of read the article instead of skimming it. Keep up the great work guys. I think the POS system will flourish but I don't think the debit card will be that huge. Also, Bitcoin solves an insanely large hard to solve economic problem, by choosing to incorporate litecoin you might create more volatility going forward thus not helping that solution :). I know as a Bitcoin holder I am biased, but if you want to see this huge economic transition be as smooth as possible, maybe don't include litecoin?

Thanks a bunch man! I would love to see more merchants in China! I feel like  will always be under representing China's adoption because of the language difference. Hopefully for the start you can help that along. Plus, I am keen on getting one map fully populated to serve as a good measuring stick of adoption.

I completely disagree with this. For the tech savvy, alt-coins are a great way to experiment. However, during bitcoins mainstream adoption, confusing the masses is not a great idea. They can always get more involved if they want to. EDIT: When I said completely disagree I mean I completely disagree with any big adoption of alt coins :). I think this is a winner take all scenario and a great future for human kind if cryptocurrencies succeed. And there in lies the incentive for bitcoin to succeed. Cause if it doesn't, I don't think people will ever be able to hop on another movement. Or at least it will be a challenge for them to. So why confuse people with any big adoption of alt-coins? It's only good for experimenting. People will not want to switch over again.

I am just going to through this out there even though you seem to be getting lots of unsolicited advice. 
How I secure my Bitcoins: 
I have 8 different cold storage paper wallets at home each with small amounts. Then I also back up those private keys a 2nd time by writing them down on a piece of paper that I carry with me folded in my wallet. (Just incase house burns or something retarded like that.) Then for daily purchases I use Coinbase - my "transaction" wallet. Whenever I run out I either buy more or use the ones I have in cold storage. Since I have done this I haven't ever felt worried about losing them. When I just had the single paper wallets I would worry a tiny though, so the 2nd paper backups that I carry helped a ton. Hope that helps.....hardware wallets will be a god send when they come into the picture.

Very cool, thanks, and I agree! I emailed coindesk recently asking questions and they said they are putting up a merchant map which will be better than the rest, look forward to seeing that.

Edit: Also, like others have said, the mining industry is an essential part of bitcoins deflationary value. Look at the miners operating margin on blockchain.info charts page:

This is simply not true. In Vancouver there are 3 restaurants, 4 coffee shops, and several other random places that accept Bitcoin. I spend it on a daily basis. This will happen more often as more places accept Bitcoin. Investing will also happen in a Bitcoin financial system. It won't happen during it's adoption! Bitcoin will be the biggest return on your purchasing power until 90% of the planet has it's value stored that way. At that point you're looking at a 13%ish return if you leave your purchasing power in Bitcoin. During that last adoption phase, you will start to be better off investing in all the depressed stock prices (assuming the move creates depressed stock prices), than "investing" in Bitcoin. When/if Bitcoin gets to that crazy scenario, why would I hold my money getting an increase in purchasing power of 1% when I can buy shares in a company that will give me 5-15%? How does that scenario stop people from investing?

Thank you both :), I have been looking for that data. I recently invested in Tesla motors pre-squeeze around 35$ and a lot of the same emotions seem to hammering at me. It seems like a better product than all the rest but why don't other people compute the same result?(I know, cause it freaking sounds insane).... Am I really seeing a better form of money or am I experiencing confirmation bias? Time to do more research, and that research paid off with Tesla. (I already own a fair bit of bitcoin tucked away safely offline, but now it's just tracking it's adoption. Thanks for the data!) I think the thing to track is merchant acceptance, if it keeps going up, keep buying bitcoins. Which extends to another question, how are you guys tracking merchant adoption? I have coinmap.org, mercadobitcoin.com, bitcoin.travel. Coinmap.org has had 1 new place added every day for the past week. Also, Why isn't China on your bar graph Potato? (holy 20 questions batman)

Hi BitcoinDab,
Can you help UNICEF accept Bitcoin Donations for the relief fund via this direct donation site? 
I'am a Canadian Bitcoiner and like the rest of the community I want to donate to this disaster via Bitcoin, directly to the efforts to relieve it. I am sure the rest of the community wants to donate directly to a reputable organization but there needs to be someone to help  the Bitcoins to the local currency or if they want to use Bitcoins to pay local people who would accept them in exchange for helping, that would be great but might not be practical yet. Are there people already working on this? If not what can we do to get UNICEF to accept Bitcoins on this page? I am sure this way of donating will bring in an insane amount of money very quickly. Let us know what we can do.

Not yet, I don't think there will be unfortunately! usebitcoins.info has a nice categorize feature on it. I think what will happen is coinmap.org will keep getting populated until (hopefully) 10% of places accept Bitcoin, then the late adopters will slowly come on board, then you just use google to find a place to shop just like you normally do.....I know, ridiculous, but it's becoming more and more likely :).

The mining industry and it's ability to make Bitcoin deflationary seems to pass some people by. During the last bubble the price went to 266$ while miners were paying 50$-100$ to mine one bitcoin. At that point they sell their mined bitcoin to claim profits, or they just keep the cheap Bitcoin. Most miners elected to sell their cheap Bitcoin to the market that was paying 266$. This obviously would lead to a crash, no question about that. 
This time around, Miners are spending more money per bitcoin mined than the current price of a Bitcoin: 
So, those miners tend to hold on to the mined Bitcoin until it's worth more than they paid for it. But again, this time around their may not be as many that sell to claim profits in their local currency, they may continue to hold as well. 
Another way to look at it is, as the mining operating margin hits 0% or above, then Bitcoin is inflationary, or in Bitcoins world, rapidly inflationary. If they are below 0%, then Bitcoin is again deflationary, unless something bat shit crazy happens.

I think a cool application is to no longer have to file taxes at the end of the year. Obviously this is unlikely, but after every good/service you buy a portion of what you give to the business owner is sent to the government. Likewise, if you're an employee, everytime you get a paycheque, some portion of your pay cheque is sent. No more filing at the end of the year. It would definitely make people pay more attention to the tax dollars they are losing. Put more scrutiny on the government.

Bitpay is your best bet, but since you're working in fine dining I feel keeping things classy for now is important.

I think people that post an argument like this forget that for Bitcoin to hold it's price it doesn't actually need hordes of new buyers like the dotcom bubble would of. Bitcoin has gold mining industry economics backing it's price. I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure this is the whole point - holding the value stored in it.

The right way to invest in bitcoin is to start "saving" in bitcoin first, just a little bit, then try spending bitcoins a little bit.  to help you with that. Then after you do that, as the adoption and use of bitcoin spreads, you can start storing more of your value in bitcoins (aka saving). Why save in bitcoin? because it holds its value better than fiat currency. If merchant adoption doesn't continue, than you might not want to keep saving in it. To measure this, keep an eye on  and it's number. If it keeps going up, than you're good to go. Did that answer your question?
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:09:24

@_date: 2013-10-27 23:30:16
It so incredibly does. I can only think of one thing that makes it not a pyramid scheme. The fact that if nobody else bought bitcoin, the current owners would benefit because some of their savings wouldn't lose 3-10% per year. Plus of course they could send it anywhere and all that jazz. The unfortunate part and the part that will continue to upset a lot of people is that the early adopters benefit so much compared to the late adopters.

I highly suggest you watch the mining operating margin and estimate how much the aggregate of miners are paying per bitcoin. If it's 500$, then when the price is below that, bitcoin will remain deflationary, if it's above that, bitcoin is inflationary and the mining industry will increase shortly after.
In other words, don't buy when this chart reaches close to -200%. It's currently at -600%. Does that make sense?

@_date: 2013-12-21 22:18:36
Very good point. I think I would trust it if it's open source(like TREZOR), even if it came from China. If I can get the device and perform some procedure to verify that it functions properly before putting money on it, then China made would be fine. The verification process could be checking the software on the device and match it to the software the manufacture says should be on it, that would be a good start. If there is someway to check the hardware in the same manner, that would be the finishing touch. At that point, you know it's what you ordered. Include all the other features that TREZOR has for function and security and I think you have a home run? thoughts?

It's posts like these that make me laugh. Before I invested in Tesla motors I would purposely seek out anybody who still thought they would fail, now I am doing that with posts like yours and bitcoin! People won't buy things if the value goes up? Every heard of people spending more when they have more money? Where?  is a good place to see where. Today I ate a 3 course meal at an indian resteraunt on bitcoin, and guess what? That's happening everywhere around the world. You should probably look at maps on the bitcoin real world maps wiki and go spend some bitcoin before you give an opinion. That's fundamental analysis. Oh and just like Tesla, I could be wrong, but just like Tesla, it's not looking that way. Our opinions don't matter what so ever, the only thing that matters is brick and mortar adoption and the rate of that adoption. If it continues to go up, I buy more, if it stops or decreases, I sell. Opinions don't matter, facts do. :)

In addition to all the reasoning put forth I'd like to add that bitcoin will always have a mining price force on it. This is ONE PART of the "deflationary by design" puzzle pieces. I definitely don't think this is the most important thing to consider. The above arguments are far better, but I believe this to be one finishing touch. 
The bitcoin mining industry as a whole is most likely like the gold mining industry. Over the long run and as an aggregate they are inefficient. Meaning for every bitcoin currently mined, all fiat currency that goes into buying and operating mining gear is more than the coins mined. For example: market price of bitcoin is 140$ today, the industry is spending 141$+ per bitcoin mined. So there is always more value going in. Of course this is nothing compared to somebody selling all of their coins, but over the long run this has the same effect as the gold industry, and we all know how that worked out.....until now, when a better form of money arrived....or so we hope :).

I think you should spend more time analyzing Bitcoin and decide for yourself. Always the best way to go. But yes, plausible theory. Or, telling people about Bitcoin is part of the economic experiment that is Bitcoin. Your not necessarily telling people to buy bitcoin, your just telling them to pay attention to a currency that is deflationary which might replace ooooddddeeeellllssss of corporate giants, and it's better than the government issued currency they are currently using.

The only thing that helps it remain the standard is the insane amount of merchants that accept it compared to other crypto currencies. If another currency all of a sudden had more merchants accepting it, then we would switch, but that is almost against the laws of the currency universe at this point(network effect), who knows. But that is the main indicator that I look at for the moment. Can you buy food and beer in every mega city in every continent/country with other alt coins yet? No, but you can with Bitcoin.

Coming from Canada here. There a lot of different opinions out there for what Bitcoin needs to be successful. I am of the opinion that a 5$-10$ hardware wallet is an absolute necessity for brain-dead-grandma-friendly user security. It's a bit of a challenge of course, but please use  as a reference and please watch the video on the front page before replying. Infact, you should try to make what TREZOR is making but cheaper, although I think they will beat you to it :). 
You'll see in the video this device is insanely easy and if after watching the video you don't read how it works I'll explain one key aspect. It's unhackable and money is recoverable if lost. :). From what I know the transaction operation works like this: You send a transaction request to the single purpose computer from software on computers, phones, etc, it signs the transaction request with the stored private keys, then sends the signed transaction back to the computer. The private keys never leave the device. It can be used with malware infested computers and not have to worry about funds being stolen. It's obviously for storing the bulk of your savings, and send spending money to transactional wallets as needed. Plus, all the code is open source so it should be easy for you guys to see what is under the hood.
Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. :)

I am going to be brave and say, 600 is the new bottom or very close to.
The first bubble had a 30x top, 2nd had a 10x top, 3rd had 3.5x top from their starting prices. As well, the stabilization price is increasing as a percentage of each top. The first was 10%, then 45%, then I am guessing this will be 70%. Trend to notice, each bubble is becoming smaller and the stabilization price is becoming closer to the tops. Obviously past performance does not indicate future results, but it's important to analyze what you can. I hypothesis that the reason we see this is after each price rise, the currency is spread over a greater percentage of the population, and that population allocates Bitcoins to an appropriate amount of their portfolio. Once properly allocated, they enjoy a deflationary currency and start spending it and testing it out, that leads to the next wave of adoption. Just my 2 cents. Edit: Hopefully this is true because then the bubbles won't be as shitty and it'll be better as a currency.

I have your answer: Once Bitcoin is adopted the deflation rate will be a measly 1% (guessing yes, but it will be small). Where as if you invest your BTC you will aim for 7% returns on average  or higher if taking greater risk. Do you really think gaining 1% is all that great? People just don't have to buy bonds anymore to fight inflation, simplifies a hell of a lot.

I like this post, great stuff. I was wondering 2 questions: 
1) Where can I see a list of the most popular subreddits and their membership numbers?
2) How long has this subreddit been open?
3) How can I view the super old posts when it was first opened.
4) Does anybody know where I can find a graph showing the number of bitcoin subreddit members every month?
infinity) Just kidding about 2, insert endless question list.

Question to herz: I see how bitcoin only has value because we agree it does, but looking at gold mining industry as an example, isn't the price of bitcoin somewhat propped up by mining activity? Yes if everyone sold their bitcoins the price would go down, but considering the new comers are purchasing smaller portions of the supply and holding onto them to preserve value and thus giving the price stability, the likelihood of everyone selling is becoming less. Now here's my question, does the mining activities poor more money into the system then what they receive? This essentially means that if nobody trades bitcoin on a given day, the miners as an aggregate are still pouring more then 110$/BTC into the system propping up the price just a little bit?

Hi there! It's definitely weird the first time you hear about bitcoin and continue to investigate. You will feel a bit disoriantated at first and then when all the puzzle pieces come together you say to yourself "Satoshi you goddamn genius". The website, bitcoinsimplified.org, already posted is great. Some sources of info that I learned from are as follows:
Watch these Bitcoin khan academy videos as an amazing introduction:
Watch these cryptography videos to become more comfortable with the technology used to create the security in bitcoin:
Watch this youtube video. It's a speech by Erik Voorhees on why bitcoin is significant. If you know anything about the money system or economics you'll be able to relate and hell, even if you don't, it's a good lesson:
After that what is left is to actually buy a bit, and keep your private keys in cold storage!!
Edit: One more thing, once you know all that stuff, you will hopefully conclude that bitcoins success is currently being determined by it's adoption by merchants. Some maps to track this progress are coinmap.org and travel.bitcoin. Coinmap had 212 places 6 days ago, now it has 221. This, like many other maps, is one indication of adoption.

Thank you for sharing that! Do you know if they're pre-order lineup is already huge? Is that why you have to wait till December? or are they just doing that to ship tons at once... 
I am in Vancouver and have talked to the guys here. I know how much man power it takes to run just one ATM so I know this is a challenging situation. You have to stock the ATM with loads of cash and come back almost everyday to readjust the float due to heavy activity. That needs to be maintained by a local person. I suggested to them that they start crowd funding the purchase price of the ATM and then just operate it. Since they are the most reputable so far I feel this would actually be possible. I am ok with them making a little extra money to run the show, just as long as ATMs get out there fast before any mad bank crack down :). 
Now that you know my thoughts and already know tons about purchasing one, is there anyway the community can crowd fund some effort to create a faster roll out across the globe?

@_date: 2013-12-14 06:01:48
This is an interesting point. I do recall during the last crash there were an enormous amount of Bitcoins dumped on the market fairly quickly (~140,000) and it still recovered. And if they did liquidate, people would know it's them and probably start buying them since they know it's not holders of the currency but government trying to make their panic mark. I have considered this to be a significant challenge coming up, but it seems it can be overcome.  What are other thoughts on this issue? I am curious.

I think this is very good to bring up. You need to make a date for the community to adopt this notation. That's how mBTC got started. People can choose either one, but at least we have two main ways to refer to them.
EDIT: I would propose a small adjustment though. refer to the first 6 decimal places as satoshis and the last two as decimal satoshis. The fact that the community knows the last one is a satoshi doesn't really matter. Then the denomination makes sense in everyone's eyes. 1,000,000.00 satoshis is equivalent to 1 BTC. 4,000.00 satoshis = 2$. Etc.

Adam sir, congrats on joining the team. I am part of the Vancouver Bitcoin community and I absolutely love Coinbase and what you are doing. Especially the Gliph partnership and the potential there. 
To answer your question: If there is one type of good that people want, it's groceries. Obviously, this is already a major focus for Coinbase, and it's a challenging one. If it's not a major focus, it should be. Sorry for pointing out the obvious, but I didn't see anybody else say that suggestion.
When you do get grocery stores accepting Bitcoin, post it on  . I monitor that map with Stick from Trezor (the github repo owner).

I haven't had the chance to reply to this thread until now. I can see everyones' points. I think most bitcoiners would consider success as taking a piece of the market from BOTH fiat currencies and gold. We can already see it taking a piece of the Gold market. Gold is not very good for transactions but is a great store of value. Fiat is not a good store of value but is good at transactions. Bitcoin does both of these things very well. I know replacing both of these is ambitious but I think we all see increasing signs of validation from various data sources. So I think by this definition of success, merchant adoption is very important. This will ensure there is more demand for bitcoin than both fiat and gold. One way for all of us to play an active role is to update these maps!

I know you're going to hate me for asking this. But why is deflation bad for a currency in your view? I don't mean hyper deflation which bitcoin will experience many times during its adoption, but steady deflation if bitcoin is the primary currency used in the world. Say if financial professionals could estimate that there is a constant deflation rate of 2% as people all over the world store more of their value in the single currency. I know this is a tough subject, sorry ahead of time for asking :).

Hey Herz! thanks for the reply. I definitely 100% understand the protocol and the money supply of bitcoin. I was wondering this: If one tricked out advanced ahead-of-the-curve miner spends 70$ of electricity, ASIC miner equipment, rent, etc which fills the catagories of fixed, variable, and overhead costs. (In the gold mining industry they call it all-in-cost) ....and that miner gets a coin at the current rate of 110. He's making a good pay day per coin. (obviously this is hard to computer in real life given the nature of fixed, variable, and overhead costs.) Onward... the aggregate is not tricked out and ahead-of-the-curve. So as an aggregate do they spend more USD per bitcoin mined than market rate? Do they spend 112USD$ per bitcoin mind and as the price goes up it continues to rise? This would essentially create a guaranteed flow of USD into the bitcoin economy, giving it a floor that rises gradually, just like the gold industry...well played satoshi, well played.

I feel like the major difference this time is the mining industry is actually spending more to mine bitcoins than the current price. Last time when it hit 266, the mining industry was spending 50 dollars to mine each one. That's similar to printing money and it devalues it. Now that mining is somewhere in the 500$ mark per bitcoin, things are bit different. If It does crash to say 200 or less I would think that something is fundamentally wrong with bitcoin or my mining aggregate cost estimate is off. Thoughts? Anybody know exactly how much the mining industry is spending per bitcoin mind?

During the April crash the mining industry was spending 50-100$ per Bitcoin, so obviously there would be lots of Bitcoin sold from miners for them to claim profits.

Shouldn't it still serve as a good store of value? Why am I wrong here :) I definitely want to know.

Buy it gradually. A good way to buy slowly is through coinbase cause they impose daily buy limits. Then experiment using small amounts with cold storage. When you first mess with cold storage learn about change addresses, no really, learn about change addresses or you could lose money. Once you have done that, you could do something similar to what I do. I have 8 different cold storage paper wallets at home each with small amounts. Then I also back up those addresses a 2nd time by writing them down on a piece of paper that I carry with me folded in my wallet. (Just incase house burns or something retarded like that.) Then for daily purchases I use Coinbase, my "transaction" wallet, to buy stuff with BTC on a regular basis. Whenever I run out I either buy more or use the ones I have in cold storage. Since I have done this I haven't ever felt worried about losing them. When I just had the single paper wallets sitting at home I would worry a tiny bit, so the 2nd paper backups that I carry helped a ton. Hope that helps.....hardware wallets will be a god send when they come into the picture, they make all this redundant.....way more convenient and just as secure.

Do you live by a merchant that accepts bitcoin as payment?  . That's always a helper. Then you can say, hey, you can go get value here! What Riegel suggests is solid. Another suggestion would be to get 5 people to download the coinbase app before hand, and while you're presenting get each of them to distribute the bitcoin to people and help those people download the app in the process. Saves you the time and the people that are helping can get more bitcoins then everybody else as a reward.

I just post this for newer people and figure it might help:
- 1) Great series of videos for an intro to Bitcoin: 
- 2) Great series of videos for a more in depth look at encryption and why it works:  (Note: only need to watch ancient cryptography and modern cryptography)
- 3) Best explanation of why Bitcoin is a good thing: 
After you watch those. Buy some bitcoin at any of the exchanges.  is pretty solid. It forces you to gradually get into bitcoin cause there are daily buy limits. There are many other exchanges like btce, campbx.  is a good list and view of all.
Also, if you know a merchant who is just starting to accept bitcoin, then  is a great place to post their business.

I now pretty much only buy those things from those businesses. That's a pretty universal theme everywhere.

Why would you get a big mining rig when you can just accept bitcoin as a form of payment for whatever good or service you produce? I think that is a better start and easier for your business partners to understand....as long as you have an easy way to convert it into cash if their sceptical, if not, then hold onto the earned bitcoins and hang on for the ride.

3. Watch this speech by Erik Voorhees on the significance of bitcoin. If you know anything about the money system or economics you'll be able to relate, and it's a good lesson even if you don't: 
After that, what is left is actually to buy a bit and keep your private keys in cold storage(if you're holding a lot)

Well I definitely don't think senseless appreciation is good for a currency, I think gradual appreciation, a good store of value, transferability, and fungability, is good for a currency. Infact, it's the preferred type of currency which is why Bitcoin has a great chance of succeeding. When there is a better product on the market, it usually wins. No guarantees, but it's got some serious potential.

Just messed around with the app for a bit. It looks very very promising, but the withdraw function on the lightning wallet portion of the app is "coming soon". (if anybody else is not experiencing this issue please let me know)
I don't want to take away from everything else about the app though. It's incredibly easy to use. It makes me very happy to see such progression in this area of the bitcoin space.
Edit: Does anybody know if the missing functionality is due to the current lightning protocol or due to the actual app?

I personally can not wait to buy groceries and pay rent in bitcoin. I think it's a fallacy to think people will hoard bitcoins when they need to eat, pay for rent, go to college(debatable choice :) ), invest in stocks, pay for a trip, travel, etc. All of which I prefer to do in bitcoin.

holy f'ing hell......
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:22:00
Same here, plus I would like to put in my 2 cents to coastermongers comment. Just because there is new coins entering circulation doesn't mean there is inflation. That only happens when it doesn't cost anything to make the new money. In other words, miners are essentially trading in fiat money for the newly mined Bitcoins and essentially assigning the coins that value because they don't want to lose on their mining investment. And since the mining industry as an aggregate is inefficient, each new coin is worth a little bit more than the ones in existence....does that make sense? This equation does fluctuate during bubbles though.
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:22:32

@_date: 2013-10-03 23:42:20
There are only three main informative video sources you need to watch to explain Bitcoin enough for people to get it:
- 1) Khan academy videos which are the best introduction to Bitcoins out there: 
- 2) Again, Khan academy videos which are the best introduction to cryptography and why bitcoin is 100% safe if you know even the basics: 
Note: Only two sections from there. Ancient Cryptography Section, Modern Cryptography section
- 3) This is probably the most important thing to watch, it is a great speach by evoorhees on why Bitcoin is fundemtnally a better form of money then anything we have in existance. If it was not a better form of money, we would not use it. 
Enjoy! And let me know how it turns out!

I think that's a really good idea. This needs to happen at least somewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:24:57
This will happen way later in Bitcoin's life. Right now the first adopters will start storing their value in Bitcoin and working for Bitcoin. In this stage it's easier to keep calculating price on fiat, but as people grow to appreciate a delationary currency(pun intended), they will slowly feature the price, but waaaaayyyyy later. Like we are talking 50% adoption around the world way later.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:41:16
I highly recommend reading the thread I linked to. It explains how Bitcoin becomes better at being deflationary as we move forward. The price rises quick because this is the adoption phase and there is a lot of value stored in other forms of money that will be packed into this form of money.

ya, this is terrible. I don't think the mining industry as an aggregate is even profitable. I could be wrong, but I am currently gathering data to test this hypothesis.
