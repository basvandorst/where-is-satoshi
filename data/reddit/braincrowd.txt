Thats kind of the point, see the streched Font at the side. But thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:17:20

@_date: 2018-01-29 20:04:16
LOL would personally report it to the police if i would see one XD

Come on, Bring the Bitcoin Memes back.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:11:38
Bitcoin was from the ground up designed to be resistant against banning. 
This is Actually the Reason why we have 10min Blocktimes and not shorter, so that in the event of Bitcoin becomming illegal we could migrate everything to the Tor or other anonymizing Network.
With Small Blocks and Slow Blocktime we can Hide very well.
(Read the Whitepaper)

Put in my Buy order at 10'200$
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:51:57
Thought about selling my GPU mining rig.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:13:03
Mempoolcoin coin is dead -99.8% :(
Never invest in this again.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:23:15
Probably doesnt affect GPUs that much, since these asics are probably still only for the bigger coins
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:35:15
Sorry only 21'000'001 Available
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:59:47
No cloud mining really is, except for the Hoster themself.
Ether buy Bitcoin directly or Gamble and Buy an Asic directly.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:17:08
Yeah caus the Government gonna get yo Ass if you hold BTC XD
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:05:49
Bitcoin Lightning makes Bitcoin Fast and Cheap again.
So there is basically no reason to use Bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:14:07
No you can only buy Bitcoin (At a shitty rate) but not pay with them
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:46:48
I used BTCMP.com
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:58:16
Its the same Problem as with the Mining Pools. 
There Will be big ones, but when the small Miners (or People) Do not Like the what the Big Pools/Lightning Hubs behave they can just ignore or Block them.
Blacklisting a path in the Lighning Network is feasable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:05:58
nah, 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:05:35
Even Thow i dont like Regulations, this is one of the good Points. It forces to Exchanges to manage their risk and get insurance and so on.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:43:42
Just did :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:05:29
Why did you not warn us LOL
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:04:34
I was always Very sceptic of cex.io since the start. but the fact that they are sill around now is at least a little bit of a positive fact. So i think they are not too bad.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:03:13
With more Adoption due to Ligthning it seems quite possible.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:51:26
Good thing buying Stocks is not as easy as buying Crypto XD
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:08:07
To say it with the good words of Trevon James:
"The Governments are pussys bro."
But yeah, as far as i know it does not really support Mining yet. (Or Steemit for that matter)
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:42:34
Where can i Buy this Testnet Coin ? XD
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:30:14
Too much work for a "only" 2 BTC and if they repeat it, it will get suspicious.
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:23:45
True we are still in the **ARPANET** age, so who whants to be our [Tim Berners-Lee]( and get this shit mainstream?
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:53:39
Well that doesn't mean i'm in front of a Computer all day. But I work as a Computer Programmer, I watch netflix, I meeting new people that i get to know from the internet. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:41:18
My job, my friends, my hobbies, my entertainment, my relationship **Everything** is based on the Internet. Just imagining that 30 Years ago non of that what I'm living daily was even imaginable is just crazy!
I'm so hyped and curious to see where Bitcoin and the World in general is going. I do see a very bright Future ahead!   
(More so for Bitcoin then the world but still)
These sure are very exited Days to live in.
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:03:30
Guess where i'm gonna have a coffee next week ;)
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:06:25
I like it very much.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:50:35
Well since all my Shitcoins are worthless now (BTC ratio) i'm pretty much 99% Bitcoin.
I'm buying all the Loss from Altcoin in Bitcoin so my Portfolio stays the same round BTC number :)
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:30:21
it's ok bro
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:08:21
Spreading the word about bitcoin and using it to transact
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:49:21
Pretty much, trained on a Tesla V100 for about 30 Hours
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:59:05
Just instead of buying something for 20$ with your credit card, buy it with 20$ worth of bitcoin then buy 20$ worth of bitcoin agan. Maybe you lost some transaction fees but this way your net stays the same. I do that whenever possible. Because only when merchant see that bitcoin is actually used they will build more support.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:11:37
True that.
Was in now way my intention to make him look bad. He truly is a hero.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:27:01
Well you could argue for spending und using it
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:28:33
Holding ist just the first part. I believe that Spending and actually transacting is also quite important. And running a own Bitcoin node is not that complicated and you learn a lot  about bitcoin in the process.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:27:24
Thanks for your part
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:55:28
You can spend and replace, so you didn't actually loose any money but you used and promoted bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:10:13


He does know da wae
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:30:58
He lost it in mtgox
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:09:52
Anything is a possibility including Satoshi using language on purpose. But its a certainly a clue.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:06:42
Your right of course :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:28:07
it does always
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:01:32
Well still a WIN i guess
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:58:52
Given his Backstory of Scamming everyone and everything I 100% believe he isn't Shatoshi. 
He could easaly prove it with a Signed message from the Genesisblock or an other known Address. IF THAT WERE THE CASE I WOULD SELL ALL MY CRYPTO INSTANTLY!
But yeah he isnt.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:46:23
Thanks will use it on my LED Display
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:47:55
Saw Vegeta and was read to downvote, but you managed to snitch a upvote from me :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:37:33
If he really invented it he didnt do it out of the alturistic motivation that satoshi said he did. (Crush the banks and be good for everyone) But craig wold have done it only to profit from it and i am sure that he would sell his coins one day. Remember satoshi has more than ~~1000~~ **1'000'000** bitcoin which he until now never touched. The market would get flooded with new coins from him and the prive would crash pretty hard.
Edit: some zeros :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:30:13
Satoshi is pretty sure from the UK based on his Language. And quite likley multible People are behind the persona.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:26:20
"Its a means of doing illegal transactions" - Moron
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:03:40
First there is a British newspaper article referenced in the Genesis block.
Secondly there is this quote from satoshi from July 5th 2010:
"Sorry to be a wet blanket, But, writing a description of Bitcoin for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to.
I've never heard a non-British person use wet blanket or bloody as they are used here. Well possibly Australians when it comes to Bloody.
And in all of his forum posts he uses british spellings for: analyse, colour, organise and defence
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:18:47
Yeah real satoshi is from the future
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:23:54

gonna take some profits at 50k
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:27:11
If they get hacked, the hacker can't spend the Money since the coins are tainted, and with the Insurance they may buy back even more Bitcoin. So ether way nice for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:20:37
He uses uk english pretty much everywhere in his posts with some pretty unique english words that only uk people use.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:21:28
like Groundhog day this thread is
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:22:51
Well if it gets approved there is no reason to cash out too early
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:49:17
All the time but then i remind myself that i will maybe think in the future that i could only go back to 2018 to buy sub 10k.   
So i try to act so i wont regret it in the future.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:23:30


@_date: 2018-04-13 14:43:26
You will regret it in a Year ;)
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:31:22
Its 5000CHF per year sorry
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:09:23

@_date: 2018-12-11 22:28:02
buy 0.01BTC and go 100X on Bitmex ;)
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:44:23

@_date: 2018-12-11 22:27:19
probably early adopters that sold to institutions
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:09:49
