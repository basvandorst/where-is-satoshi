Wikileaks documents have never, not once, been shown to be fabricated.
Yes, the CIA can pretend to be Russia. The FBI certainly influenced the election, what makes it ridiculous for the CIA to do the same?
These agencies are partisan with internal factions like any other large group of people. Historically they have behaved in contradictory ways.
There is nothing about the speculation that is without precedent.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:24:44
Because if they can remote into your devices, they can take your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:38:36
It makes the evidence ("digital fingerprints") touted to support the claim completely unreliable. The CIA is just as partisan as anyone else, it is just people. If the FBI can influence the election, why not the CIA?
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:19:01
The leaks state that the CIA stole foreign hacking tools from Russia and other countries and used them to hack while leaving a trail framing the countries whose tools they had stolen.
If you were the CIA, when would you NOT want to cover your tracks by framing another country? Basically, we can no longer have any idea who is behind what hacks because the CIA has Russian tools, the Russians presumably have CIA tools, etc, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:49:45
But that, which I do agree with, is not relevant to the validity of these leaks regarding the CIA.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:02:20
Can you explain how additional context here would vindicate the CIA? What would it look like if it were to be leaked?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:24:01
They can access your routers too. Is there a custom firmware that would be good to install, anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:05:31
Hmm that makes sense. We will see what the CIA says, but my satoshis are on them saying nothing to confirm or deny anything.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:57:36
They have never released false documents that we know of. I suppose we will soon see if the CIA denies they are real, but history tells us it is very, very likely that it is.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:15:08
Sorry, misread. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:58:48
So core is centralization then? Or does core not exist as an entity that can agree to anything?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:23:12
Because it completely shatters the narrative of "Russian hackers".
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:27:33
Then go proof of stake. Any objections to this?
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:37:53
Most of the hash power agreed. If you split the hash power in half is your branch of the fork even worthwhile? Will some people want PoS in case of such a large drop in hashrate? Then....if you still persist....what will your hash power be on your "true bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:15:46
Erosion of first mover advantage. You don't negotiate with anyone apparently. I guess we should both call it a night, this won't go anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:27:28
A second contentious fork on the network is extremely reckless. This is what core seems to be pushing by backing away from the very agreement that got them segwit. The fork needs to be smooth. Will the market tolerate three "bitcoins" without rolling their eyes and moving on? What cash did was shitty. Why would we seek to do the same thing again? 
Contributors, miners, and community are all equally important and it is time we started treating each other that way. Erosion of any of these fundamental pieces is bad for the network as a whole. We need to be unified in our way forward.
No, I don't care who core is or isn't. I don't care from what authority they argue. I care about the network. It's unity, it's power, and it's integrity.
I never supported larger blocks. I was always in wait-and-see mode while having a bias towards Segregated Witness. I just wanted it to be over.
What core is currently saying with 2x hostility is fuck all the people who committed to the agreement in good faith. You know what I didn't see? The majority of core speaking out against segwit2x until now that segwit locked in. It happened only on the understanding that you would follow through with your gentleman's agreement. 
You literally only got what you wanted because most of the miners that wanted bigger blocks met you in the middle to create consensus. Try to give a technical argument for being shit humans. 
The inevitable result of this second contentious fork will be minority hash power resulting in, yep, another fork to PoS instead of PoW (a proposal, mind you). See how dominant you are when your hash power matches cash. Fools.
You are no better than big block purists with cash if you fork away from segwit2x at this point. "But it is segwit2x forking away!" Only if you act like children and would rather harm everyone than agree to disagree and move together regardless to benefit everyone. The bitcoin community is tired of this shit.

"Why would those persons be beholden to an agreement made entirely by other parties."
Because without the overwhelming hash power bitcoin is not compelling. The more contentious forks that happen, the worse it is.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:18:29
Of course they can speak out, but either "core wasn't invited" isn't an argument or "core" is a centralized entity.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:55:28
I know, I know. I burn my accounts regularly.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:29:18
What I was posing was a hypothetical since 51% attacks have been known to happen on smaller hash power coins. If you split the network in three what is to stop 1/3 from attacking another third? I really need to go to bed man. I think you do too.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:30:19
I don't think Craig Wright is a very smart person at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:42:07

Look, I'm done with discussing this evening. Have a nice night. I don't need to threaten for anything, bitcoin has already given me anything I want in life. I am here because I simply disagree. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:26:21
Without hash power contributors are not needed, unless you move to PoS creating even more division within the former community. Hash power AND contributors together make bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:23:03
I would appreciate you more if the argument from authority fallacy was less blatant. You aren't wrong, but going about it this way is not ideal. It's not about any one person. It would be more constructive to make that argument without invoking the fact that you developed segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:09:03
But according to core apologists they aren't a group but a loosely associated network of people that make commits and proposals  for peer review. The best as determined by meritocracy in an open source environment.
So how can a group that supposedly does not exist except loosely not be invited? It's like saying no member of anonymous was invited to the meeting.
And again, I support segwit. I always have.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:45:17

@_date: 2017-08-10 07:32:11
And what stops 51% attacks on the network? Not nodes.
Everyone needs each other. That is the point. Refusing the find common ground is certainly your right and ability. That doesn't make it smart.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:29:43
I just don't want to see the community fracture itself yet again. Litecoin has proven bigblock segwit works. If it doesn't then why has nobody claimed the 1m bounty to break it? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:11:14
Well, enjoy your branch. I'll enjoy my community participation, nodes, ASICs, and million bucks investment elsewhere.
It's a lose/lose to refuse to work together. Segwit2x was the biggest middle ground we had. Refusing to negotiate is the hallmark of extremism. You severely underestimate first mover advantage and the erosion mechanics that can happen.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:22:10
Have a nice night man.
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:06:48
Why would you not just move the XMR across multiple XMR addresses before sending back through?
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:10:36
segwit2x is the agreement by consensus of majority hash power, not the other way around.

This is a flawed position I think. Without the maintenance of* first mover advantage bitcoin loses much of its momentum. Each contentious fork erodes that. It also erodes hash power which is the security of the network. We need contributors, miners, and community members equally.

@_date: 2017-08-10 07:34:51
With how much hash power at that point? Every fork is a loss of hash power due to disagreement. Do you not see the benefit in common ground?
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:14:11
When they can atomic swap with each other it really becomes one network of gold and silver. Hold the gold, spend the silver. I see no reason at all why they cannot be symbiotic in their relationship now that both have segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:20:35
Exactly which group forced everyones hand in the first place? Those that placed the August 1st deadline to get segwit at all costs by putting a gun to everyones head. And I thought it turned out ok in the end until recently. There was no alternative then to come to some sort of agreement to maintain unity within the community.
You seem to take no heed to the reality that bitcoin has contenders knocking at its door. First mover advantage is eroded with each fork. Don't be reckless. 
Who will maintain it? Whoever gets consensus for their proposals and commits. This isn't difficult. Cash could not get consensus so they forked so they could within their own little community. This is the same shit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:40:27
You realize that is exactly the proposal from if minority hashing power is a reality due to too many forks, right?
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:47:40
You called PoS less controversial than a block size increase. So then, what's your plan without enough hash power to secure the network then? 
You are a megalomaniac with a cult following lacking in social aptitude. You are not any more important than anyone else. Stop being an extremist fanning the flames of community breakdown.
 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:17:59
Hash power is security. That is the extent of your current security model.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:26:49
Don't puss out, do 1m candles :D
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:54:06
So what does this say then? You'll be left with a payment network with no payment processors and not enough hash power to secure the network.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:54:44
You would rather bitcoin burns before....people agree reluctantly to keep as many people together as possible? That's psychotic behavior.
Segwit2x was what got segwit locked in. It was two groups with differences meeting and finding common ground.
You are an extremist seemingly? I hate to think that.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:34:07
If there is just a big block BTC and a segwit BTC then litecoin is the oldest, most unified chain exceeding both in technical merit. It must be both. For everyone's sake.

@_date: 2017-08-10 08:32:42
PoS means yet another fork meaning you would need to leave the very chain you are defending now.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:42:47

What part about I run core nodes do you not understand? You're being ridiculous right now.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:42:46


This makes no sense as ETH network regularly handles more transactions daily. 1 transaction is 1 transaction regardless of chain.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:20:13
I run three core nodes thank you. You don't get to tell me whether or not I belong here. You are so fanatical and paranoid that you are lashing out at anyone that suggests they view something differently than you. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:56:50
You are being rather toxic in this thread. You said that ETH fees are cheap because nobody wants to use that chain. The fact that it regularly handles more daily transactions very clearly shows us that you are incorrect. 
Everything else you have said is textbook red herring. It's totally irrelevant to the issue of fees.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:09:34
I am a maximalist since 2010 and I care about fees. I think fully utilized segwit solves this for now, but I care about fees.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:40:54
Trade volume is off chain unrelated to network capacity or fees. Supply is also unrelated to network capacity or fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:24:28
Which is exactly why the cost of running a node is so important. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:50:45
What exactly suggested I support 2x? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:06:03
I simply said I do care about fees. This does not mean I support 2x. Fees matter to me though. I even said I think segwit can address my concerns if it is adopted further.
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:05:44

Relax guys, we are still up infinite % from 0. ;)

I would rather see segwit2x with each side getting some of what they want and sticking together. A split could bump BTC market cap and market share out of first place. I feel like a soft fork diminishes the first mover advantage to some degree by creating "new" coins. 
At that point a strong case can be made in favor of litecoin which would then have a longer history of a unified chain, greater capacity due to 4x block minting rate and 4mb mempool, clear roadmap and leadership, and an established ecosystem not requiring the accomodation of two forks.
If you consider a soft fork to reset the clock so to speak then litecoin is arguably superior to a soft BTC fork.

But.....if the exchange isn't getting to the ticket submitted by the lawyer any faster than they would have otherwise what good will it do? It's not like you can just send exchanges letters in the mail or call them.

Pirate Bay of BTC exchanges idea is really, really fucking hilarious. The butthurt of the feds would be enough to salt the entire interstate system forever.

I will be tethering so I can jump right into either BTC or ETH/LTC while maintaining a certain USD value. All three will be impacted one way or the other. If the BTC community fractures we lose most of the advantages we currently have. We need unity.

Yea, everyone should hodl until I decide I want to realize my gains and not hodl anymore.
I know it is a meme, but how is it not completely hypocritical to try and shame others out of taking a modest gain so that you can take a larger gain later?

I am in this situation right now where I looked into cashing out and realized the two primary sources of my coins are bitinstant and mtgox and I have no way to get the records.

What bitcoin? I have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:27:50
Perhaps those people had a goal and reached it. A house, a car, a vaction, whatever. That is why we are all here. Yes, fiat mechanics are questionable relative to coin. But fiat buys the things we all want.

I know you are just explaining the law as it stands and this isn't directed at you but that is hilariously stupid if true.

If you can't see the utility in bitcoin, what are you doing here?
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:25:27
I understand, but the concept of "holding" bitcoin is abstract. If I remember my seed do I need to declare it? If it iis encrypted in the cloud and I can later access it do I need to declare it? I am always holding bitcoin, yet I am never holding bitcoin. Can I delete my wallet app and reinstall it? What if I locked myself out of a wallet? Does having access to the internet mean I am in possession? 
Of course, the reality of the situation makes it trivial to just not declare it, but it is interesting conceptually.

Your ticket is ridiculous. You are wasting their time with half of that.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:22:11
So the people taking their profits are greedy because they didn't hold so that you could take an even bigger profit later on?

Literally every exchange is having trouble keeping up with support ticket floods. That isn't an exaggeration. You name an exchange and I'll find you 5 recent posts about slow support. Finding competent and trustworthy support employees can only go so fast while volume and user numbers can increase much faster.

The truth is better than giving false hope.

Have you considered that perhaps this is due to uncertainty in the market resulting in lower transaction volume?

The mempool has cleared out because of the uncertain immediate future. People are moving their coins off exchanges and into their own wallets to wait out the storm.

Absolutely agreed. The problem is that if this sell order was legitimate then the outcome of the sell is therefore also legitimate.
On what grounds would one argue that they deserve compensation when the outcome of a legitimate market event was not favorable? Of course Coinbase can do as they choose, the question is are they doing this in response to a legit market event or an illigegitimate event?

People should not place orders they aren't willing to see filled. Halting trading like that will inevitably end up preventing sell orders during a real crash leaving users holding coin worth less than the price when they tried to sell and could not.


The difference is one is the result of being DDOSed or overloaded with users involuntarily. The other is voluntary. Both result in users not being able to trade. When users can't trade, they get pissed.


Agreed. People need to take personal responsibility and make educated trades. Exchanges should not be responsible for decisions users make.

If cryptocurrencies don't stand together they won't beat the governments and banks of the world. The idea is a long shot, but without respectful discourse across chains it is impossible.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:39:06
When the stock market halts trading, the price freezes. When a coin exchange halts trading, the coin is still being traded elsewhere.
If you halt trading because of a huge and fast crash and that coin crashes even more, you just screwed every user trying to sell.

No, it becomes the coinbase users problem if the price is crashing from $15, they cant sell at $10 due to a trading halt, and the other exchanges drive the price down to $5 and leave it there.
