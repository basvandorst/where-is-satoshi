you repeatedly demonstrate your actual level of understanding.
from the medium article that this thread is about


all emphasis mine.
You have the second highest post in this thread


you say you read it but clearly didn't understand it. 


bloody hell your doubling down, 
it is in fact the set of all Unspent Outputs which I assure you is not the "cache of unconfirmed transactions"


ah well love you to bits
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:04:27
still no answer then? I and others will have to assume you don't have one.

The dishonest and slippery u/Cryptolution deletes his post, confirming yet again he is a fool as he knows I had a timestamped copy of it on archive.is its the little blue 2 at the end of the "unconfirmed transactions." comment.
here is the deleted post 










here is the link on archive.is [Don't Trust, Verify](
edit. look at [context]( to see rebuttal.
He seems incapable of admitting he was wrong, u/Cryptolution this is your greatest barrier to actually learning how Bitcoin or anything works. 
How much else do you misunderstand.
I would have given almost anyone else a pass as, "there but for the grace of god...."
But you are so vocal, berating people calling them stupid when you are actually quite ignorant yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:21:01
do i need to hold btc to understand how it works and, point out holes in your analogies?
what no answer to limiting UTXO limits adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:03:09


resorting to name calling when someone rebutts your weak NYA coinbase signalling is fake, argument, poor.


you don't know this


it will demonstrate the ability of the network to hard fork, far more important than the blocksize increase which will be welcome and even you will gain from this.
but we wlll see who is right in november
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:30:17
still no reply to the points then.
no high horse just noting you don't have a reply to my destruction of your "NYA coinbase fake signalling" for starters.
for those reading this how much other bullshit has he posted that seemed reasonable to the less informed.

out of interest how would an atomic swap work going from segwit1x &lt;--&gt; segwit2x? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:26:19
not really sure of the details Roger Ver &lt;--&gt; Trace Mayer 25.000 BTC trade
going from the first part of Brian Deery's excellent article an [Making MAST meaningfull](
a couple of issues as I see them (please correct any errors in understanding)
**1)** whichever side is in charge of the secret X has the choice of 
* releasing the secret X if the trade is in their favor or 
* withholding and waiting for the coins to be returned if it is not. 


**2)** It's not in the interests of supporter of SegWit2x side to not have the secret X in their possession 
* as if the fork doesn't happen and they are not in control of secret X then the Segwit1x guy takes the coins (releasing secret X) and Segwit2x guy is left holding the decidedly empty bag as there is no chain to do redeem Segwit2x coins on. nobody wants to be the bagholder.
on the surface atomic swaps don't seem to be the best solution for this particular use case, it is interesting that so many are offering them how much have they thought it through?
is there a template for an atomic swap Segwit1x &lt;--&gt; Segwit2x, hell I didn't like sending more than a few hundred dollar tx's without sending a small test tx first. then you have to trust the designer of the template and wont find out till fork day, too risky.
least risk is of course escrow but then you have to find someone both parties are happy with.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:05:34
we will find out in november.

So no answer to 
limiting UTX0 growth is limiting adoption 
thought so
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:55:30
thanks for the link.

Schnorr signature aggregation will address the issues of cleaning up after yourself, making dust much easier/free to spend.


Blocksize is the throttle on UTXO growth, not following through on the agreement that gave us Segwit is putting a hard limit on UTXO growth, and if you read between the lines Core don't seem to want to HF ever, which means a HARD LIMIT ON UTXO growth.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:20:13


the NYA agreement that got you segwit.


you didn't need to, it was made by the entities that make the rules, your part in this is if you don't agree then you sell.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:21:35
not a one, but if i did
just because i believe the way bitcoin works 
* is that the miners have the power to make the rules
* does not mean that i am sure they will exercise that power. 
i am happy to see what happens in november and buy back in or not.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:35:45


I was pointing out un-sybilable metrics, economic nodes agreed (but unless they are very big -Bitpay- how do you measure this) most of the big ones have signed an agreement and the ones that haven't -exchanges- will follow the money.


because one pool with a known history of trolling and ~10% of the hashrate says so.
dropping segwit2x miner support to 87% big-IF they joined slush.
the good thing about this is that the inertia and the fact that Chinese Miners like to keep their word something that helped core immensely post HK agreement is now working against core if they don't want to do a minimal ugrade to the protocol.
november here we come

I don't post for you, but to expose your bullshit for other people who may believe your jargon fueled empty posts, you can engage or not its up to you.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:14:12


what relevance is that, if you are wrong you are wrong


on boarding users is a cause for concern. go back to encrypted email.


pretending to be a high priest, standard practice. its not very hard to understand limiting UTXO's is limiting adoption even you should be able to grasp that.


pointless bullshit analogy as usual. throughput of tx's is what actually matters at the moment and probably for the foreseeable future.


nobody's pretending anything, limiting UTXO's limits growth, and you propose doing that while the block reward is still high and Bitcoin market share dropped from 90% to less than 50% alts waiting to eat our lunch, why would anybody listen to you.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:44:48


this guy doesn't get it.
I assume you meant UTXO, you do realize for real adoption of Bitcoin, the UTXO set has to grow significantly. Or do you want it to be a second openpgp mail system?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:48:49


November will be great, we will see if as you say an easily sybilled metric can win over one that is hard to sybil.
in short we will get a test of how bitcoin actually works, do nodes make the rules, or miners.
