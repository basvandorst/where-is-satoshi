Bitcoin wanted an unregulated currency, Bitcoin got an unregulated currency.

It's not a surprise that a ton of GAW customers also fell for the Cryptodouble scam.
However I don't see GAW connected to that post anywhere. It's just users on their forum talking. (GAW labels all of their early users as "GAW Founders" even though they aren't actually connected to the company beyond being customers.)

Aside from high transaction fees discouraging spending, read OP's post.


Bitcoin can currently only process 7 transactions per second, or 604,800 per day. Even if this is fixed and transactions per day are able to increase exponentially to 2.25 billion, network security will also need to rise dramatically as there will be far more incentive to attack a monetary system that is thousands of times bigger than what Bitcoin is now. Bitcoin will need some kind of overhaul in the future, because it will be fundamentally broken when inflation gets low enough. This doesn't mean that low perpetual inflation is the right answer, but it does fix the problem.

Your math is correct. Bitcoin won't face those problems for a long time, but they are huge problems. The funny part is that Dogecoin will never have to face them because it's accidental low perpetual inflation turned out to be a huge benefit.

They will never require heavy transaction fees to keep their network afloat in the way that Bitcoin will. I'm sure I could cite you an article if you really need it, but it boils down to really basic math.

The expectation is that transaction fees will cover the costs. This is a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin's current design, because it can currently only process 7 transactions per second.

If Bitcoin wants to be seen as innovative technology, I think it's okay to move beyond 56k connections. Does he also design his website around Netscape Navigator?

I never said any of those things. Your attitude however, is a great example of what turns many people off to Bitcoin.

Agreed. While I personally think Dogecoin is undervalued, I'd keep supporting it just as much if I knew it's price was at it's peak. I use Bitcoin, but Dogecoin offers a community and a perspective that I don't think Bitcoin ever will.
Dogecoin has also encouraged a ton of people to finally get started with crypto (including myself) so it's shortsighted to assume that all altcoins are damaging to the cryptocurrency movement.
