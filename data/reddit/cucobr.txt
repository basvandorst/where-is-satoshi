You didn't find where to put my code? Is that it?
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:50:08
Yes it is.

Yes, there is no problem.


Thank you.

terrible news.
So, this is a solid indication that prices is going up.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:24:03
You do that. It's always important to know about the coin and its project.
And if you want to invest in bitcoin, don't panic when it drops, because it will, and start to sell. 
People will make money in this situation.

Download the app **Electroneum** (iOS or Play Store) and start to cloud mining.
It'll give to you 4 USD, more or less, per month with the current price of the coin.
Isn't much, but it's better than nothing.
I suggest to hold them.
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:50:57
Actually nothing. You don't need to put your money on this.
The developers intend to increase the base of the coin. You can obviously buy electroneum in some exchange, but you can cloud mining for free, It wont consume you cellphone or anything.
I like very much of this project.
You download the app and all that you need to do is open the app 1 time per week to reactivate your cloud mining. Just that.
And if you want to increase your mining velocity you can use my code.
You'll mining 1% faster, so do I. This is a reward for promoting the coin. I'll thank you for that.
Besides Electroneum, I'll recomend you to invest in Bitcoin.
Not all you money of course, but just a little per month, or per week.

I've been thinking.... someone wanted to buy 2 BTC and instead put 20 BTC... perhaps?
But it stopped exactly at 10.900.
weird... dunno...

That is true. It's a hell of analogy if I may say.
But the catch is... for some reason the past repeat itself more often than you think... and for some other reason human behavior is driven by patterns that tend to repeat itself often, aka market memory.
But that is the reality.

Why cut out some of the fonts text?

don't advertise that you have bitcoins for god's sake.
I'ts like "hey robbers! I could have a lot of money! Wanna take a shot?"
@_date: 2019-09-15 02:40:20
Basically Libra will be a stable coin backed in USD, Euro and Pounds.
Just it.
