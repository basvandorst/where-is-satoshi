I know these guys.. whatever method used to promote bitcoin, they get my vote. 1% of 1% seems to be the ratio of knowledgeable people that first even know about bitcoin, and lastly even have a wallet. If any promotion gets the word out, im backing it. as for the trolls posting negative shit here.. gtfo, you serve no useful purpose on reddit or in real life for that matter.

GREAT ARTICLE!  As a user I have had the misfortune of running a particular crypto currency wallet on my home pc,that contained a malicious bit of code used to steal other digital currencys I had residing on my pc in wallets. I should of  checked it out prior to download. Its sad to say thieves live in every corner of our lives, but its good to know guys at Paxful are trying to at least inform the n00bs in us all. thanks guys!

My orders from October  for monarch and MBTG, same scenario, carrot dangling, upgrades vapor hardware never seeming to be working, updates etc.... were supposedly to start refunding before the FTC stepped in. Now when I send an email.. I get no response back from BFL.

Pro Tip.. Bitcoin trading is not illegal in USA! you can trade btc for any currency, you can use bitcoin to buy things, you can sell things for bitcoins. You are not a criminal if you use bitcoin.

You simply don't understand how bitcoin process and wallets work. You can make a new address with every single transaction which is what I do.. There is absolutely no way for coinbase to know its you , and you alone making these "anonymous" transactions to newly generated addresses.. wow.. simply wow. thanks for the fud, but do some simple reasoning and maybe take the tinfoil hat off for abit.

Because criminals don't use currency for illegal activities.. meh.

Once you own bitcoins , just move it where ever you like, such as a paxful.com wallet. There is no way anyone can know anything about that wallet address including where it is. It is simply a blockchain transaction. Please go to bitcoin wiki to find out how bitcoin works, and you will see how decentralized crypto currencys are the way to empower people with the ability to become their own bank.

I don't think "The backpage effect" is so much as an effect as its a movement.  The guys at paxful.com saw a void in a niche market, and acted on it , an opportunity to help spread the bitcoin message, help a group of  people, and to take on the challenges of allowing the Human element to enter the crypto currency world. Unfortunately, thieves and crooks see the opportunity to steal from these same people. If I know these guys at paxful.com , they are working on a system that will be much secure, for everyone using the site. I am sorry this has happened to you, but luckily you didn't lose much more. A lesson learned my friend, I learned this same lesson months ago. The bouncer is about to walk in. beware thieves..
