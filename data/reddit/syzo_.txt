Treat it like playing the lottery. Only "invest" what you can afford to throw away. Walking away with any amount of money is a bonus.
In bitcoin, if you're in the red, you can *probably* hold until you're not and be fine. It might take a long while, but historically speaking you've always been able to walk away in the green if you just wait long enough. This is why it's important to only invest what you can afford to throw away. Don't put yourself in a position where you absolutely need to sell off your bitcoin for IRL cash, because that's how you're likely going to lose money.
Other than that, the normal rules apply: buy low, sell high. Watch the market for a few days before buying or selling to get a feel of what's happening. Pay attention to the news and community to get even more of a feel for the market.

In BitcoinQT, at least (and probably all similar clients if I had to guess), this will show up at the bottom right corner. "Bitcoin" has a "BTC" ticker, and "Bitcoin Cash" has a "BCC" ticker.
Also, markets will also make that distinction as well, so you know what you're buying/selling.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:02:04
If you somehow know there's going to be a big drop, then yes it would always be worth it to sell right before the drop, then buy right after the drop.
Problem is, it's impossible to know the future. There's a lot of room to mess up and lose a bunch of money (or bitcoins depending on how you look at it).
Over the long term, bitcoin has performed amazingly well as-is, so in my view it's "safe enough" to just hold them and watch your money grow. *("Safe enough" in quotes, because there's still a huge risk in investing in cryptocurrency. Super high risk, super high reward. Only invest what you're willing to lose.)*
All that having been said, I've been toying with the idea of taking a **small amount** of BTC and playing the market game myself, just for funsies.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:23:59
Did it, out of BCH, switched it all for BTC.
Could have done it at a better BTC/BCH price, but whatever.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:52:01
Never bought BCH, was just holding bitcoin during the split. pure profits :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:57:50
I guess if you want to be technical, the "one true" bitcoin is the one maintained by the Bitcoin Core developers, since that is the client that started it all by Satoshi. So going back to your previous statement:


Yes, I guess *technically* that is the case. However, if you agree more with the spirit of Bitcoin Cash, or S2X, you are free to interpret them as the "true" bitcoin. It's more like a religion at that point.
Speaking pragmatically, I consider the "true" Bitcoin as: the Bitcoin (Core, BTC, whatever) fork that holds the most value in the market and/or total market cap consistenty for a "long enough" time so as to be dominant - likely along with statistics like volume and hashrate. I.E. "which coin do I think is going to be the most valuable in the long-term?" - for this definition, the consensus of the hivemind is king.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:19:20


If something overtakes bitcoin and becomes the main value store currency, then it will become "bitcoin falls when (whatever) does".
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:38:30
No. It's like that in every client, I imagine.
It not like it's one single group of people that decide this. It's more like a hivemind. People need to be able to know what they're talking about with regards to markets and trading, so either the developers of the fork itself will decide what to call it (Like Bitcoin Cash decided to be BCC), or the community will decide what to call it.
The "real", original Bitcoin is denoted BTC.
In honesty, I don't even really know what you're trying to argue here...
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:50:19


What if you mined though, like in OP's case?
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:22:20
Let me know where my reasoning breaks down here...
1. BTC/Segwit2x fork happens
2. You create a brand new s2x wallet
3. You transfer s2x from old wallet to new wallet (RIP transaction fee). Wait for transaction to be confirmed.
4. Transaction will likely be accepted on both BTC and s2x, but hopefully the s2x coins got accepted into an "incompatible" branch. If it did, your coins are now "hard-forked"; spending additional s2x coins can't affect BTC coins.
   - If transaction shows up on BTC, goto  -- you will have to do this at least once because the transaction will likely be accepted on both chains the first time.
   - If transaction doesn't show up, continue onto 
5. Transfer s2x to market, convert to BTC, hope that you can recoup the transaction fees from all of the "step 3"s. Deposit new BTCs into your BTC wallet.
6. BTC will never rebase onto the segwit2x chain, but segwit2x could possibly rebase onto the BTC chain.
7. Now if segwit2x ever rebases on the "legacy" BTC chain, you'll have all of your BTC and they will again be duplicated on s2x and you can do this all over again, if it's even worth it after s2x prices crash after the rebase.

Less of a financial guy and more of a computer science guy here, do you know where a good place to learn about these indicators are? How does (RSI == 70.9) + (MACD == 379.3) translate to "probably going to drop 30% in price soonish"?
Or is it just a "well these indicators happened in the past like this for bitcoin and X happened, so..." kind of thing?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:28:22
All of this sounds like an excellent target for machine learning ;) Too bad I don't know how machine learning works either. Possibly a cool project to learn both.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:41:06
Honestly, I'm quite alright with people trying Proof-of-whatever-they-like, as long as they don't try to fork bitcoin without replay protection again.
Variety of ideas is great, but keep it to altcoins. Don't try to fuck over Bitcoin just because you want more users.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:13:45
Yeah, I figure it won't be like "lol ezpz ML all day scrubs" cause like... I'm 10,000% definitely not the first person to think of the idea, haha. I think it'll be a neat project to combine learning about ML *and* econ at the same time, though.
Thanks for the heads up, I should probably learn some basic Econ as well as the math-ey side of the indicators.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:07:46
It'd be cool to see some sort of chart of "predicted price vs time", so see how wildly the predictions change day-to-day.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:04:10
Not significantly more than the amount being found today.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:23:08
You know it used to be 7200 per day right?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:34:53
BTC | mBTC | μBTC ("bits") | Satoshi
`0.000 000 01` | `0.000 01` | `0.01` | `1`
`0.000 001` | `0.001` | `1` | `100`
`0.001` | `1` | `1,000` | `100,000`
`1` | `1,000` | `1,000,000` | `100,000,000`
"bits" is confusing. People should just call them μBTC.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:48:54
Not significantly more **found again** if/when quantum computing takes off.
But I misunderstood what you meant, I thought you were talking about recovering bitcoins from a wallet completely lost (like if a drive crashed with no backups, for example).
I'm not sure what algorithm typical wallets use to password-protect, but likely the quantum computer will have to try the square root of the number of all possible passwords. (example: if there's 2^256 possible passwords, it would have to try 2^128 possible passwords).
If the wallet encryption is indeed equivalent to AES-256, then it's still safe from quantum computers.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:49:13
lol, nice.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:16:13
Awesome, I'll check it out.
I saw a buuuunch of different indicators when I used bitfinex, but I had no idea what I was looking at, haha.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:31:17
I just switched over to my Bitfinex tab and back. It'll probably be slightly different on other markets, and it's probably changed since I posted.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:27:16
For all those wondering in one year, the current price of bitcoin is roughly $4742.30 USD / BTC
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:40:08
A 6 year old shitcoin in the top five coins by marketcap and currently trading at almost $75 each.
Sure thing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:13:58
I'm not sure what model you or the site OP linked to are using, but I highly doubt it will hit $500k by July 2020. The only ones I could find that would work is the 2017-03 crash to the 2017-06 bubble (est $3.749M... yeah no) or the 2017-03 crash to the 2017-09 bubble ($514k.. just barely), and either way that's less than half a year's worth of data.
At the risk of everyone `!remindme`ing, I'm going to guess anywhere from $50k to $200k on 2020-07-17 (McAfee's bet date), and probably on the lower end of that range.
Have fun eating your dick, McAfee.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:13:48
They're pretty safe until you know the public key, then yes it's susceptible to Shor's algorithm.
It's still hard for quantum computers to go from Address --&gt; Public Key though.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:58:38
I sold 10BTC at around $30/each for a new graphics card.
Now it's a $50k graphics card...
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:22:39
Like I said in one of my previous posts:




Setting yourself up to be *forced* to sell bitcoin for IRL cash to repay your debt is just asking for the price to crash just before you need to sell it.
Good luck, though...
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:02:03


Holy shit, really? That's pretty scary. That's like floating point 101, not to use them for monetary purposes.
EDIT: unless, I guess, if it's just for display purposes, which would make a little more sense.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:03:44
I'd rather just use µBTC. "bits" is confusing.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:26:09


I think that's the majority opinion, yes.
A lot of idealists are putting out scenarios like "in the future, &lt;insert country&gt;'s fiat currency will be worthless, and people will turn to using bitcoin instead for payments. Just look at Venezuela today!!!"
I think Bitcoin has a long way to go before that. People won't put up with 10 minute (or even some multiple of that if you wait for X confirmations) transaction times when they go to the store, get gas, etc.
If fiat currency disappeared right now and cryptocurrencies were the only thing you could use to facilitate purchases, I bet people would get paid / store value in Bitcoin, but would keep some Ethereum in reserve to actually buy/sell things. Hell, maybe they wouldn't even deal with "storing value"...
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:33:40
To be fair, people were warning about deflationary spirals all the way back before $1.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:37:49


    &gt;&gt;&gt; num_satoshis = 21 * 1000000 / 0.00000001
    &gt;&gt;&gt; math.log(num_satoshis, 2)
    50.89931075120184
Got quite a few powers of two to work with, so I don't think that's it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:57:25
The address is a hash of your public key. You send BTC to the address.
Address --&gt; public key is still (relatively) hard for a quantum computer.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:53:21
The key is this:


The seller could either sell privately, or sell publicly. If they've chosen to sell privately, they have effectively reduced the supply of the public markets (albeit, probably only a minuscule amount).
