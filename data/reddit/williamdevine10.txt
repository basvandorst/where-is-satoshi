That's CRYPSA's (Cryptocurrency Standards Association) primary goal. To bring the community together in a democratic setting, discuss what is going on and find solutions that best fit us the community. We especially want to discuss topics where the government could step in and insert their own laws that hurt the community.

It honestly does not matter what governments do to stop the drug trade it will always exist. All they have succeeded in doing is bringing more attention to the deep web by the public creating a larger consumer base for the businesses they failed to take down. In my opinion the deep web is about to explode with new users which will create an even bigger problem for governments. For some reason governments like shooting themselves in the face, the very thing they were trying to promote, through the silk road take down.

So are we any closer to solving the scaling issue or should we cash out before the Japanese start using in mass and drive the price down because we can't come to an agreement?
