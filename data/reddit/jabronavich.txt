Why are you trying to mix your bitcoin with drug money? lol

Yeah but this guy had to go through nearly a year of bullshit litigation to get is money back.  And that's after being offered half his money back (how generous) if he took a settlement.  Who knows how many other people affected by this even had the money to pursue litigation in the first place.  Plus months of not having your money to do business resulting in lost earnings.  The government only now decides to give back his money after this story originally went into the media.  This is a bunch of bullshit - government corrupt and out of control.

Thank you for calling it Saigon and not that ugly communist dictator.

You would have to be mad or completely naive to use Bitfinex again.  But of course there will be people who go right back as if nothing had happened.  If Mt Gox were to open again with Karpeles, guaranteed some the same people who were originally ripped off would use it again without hesitation.  Using wishful thinking or just entirely ignorant.

so judging by the jurors nodding in agreement with the prosecutor, how likely do you think Ross is getting off here?  The evidence is damning, but I hate to see anyone's life ruined like the way Ross is about to get... everyone deserves a second chance.

So how likely is an appeal to happen, will Ross ever get a chance to tell his entire side of the story without 'hearsay' objections?   And doesn't this basically put a nail in the coffin for the murder trial in Maryland?

Makes me sick to think about it.  There's just sooo much evidence against him, it makes his argument of being set up at least a tiny bit plausible.
