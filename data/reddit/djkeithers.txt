Don’t get me wrong, I definitely can’t hate on free money but I think we’ve had enough forks already. 
It looks like 2018 will be the year of the forks whereas 2017 was the year of the ICO
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:30:13
Here’s another. Try to keep your Trades to a minimum and trade with your brain and not on emotion.  It’s very easy to get emotionally attached to the # of coins, rather than their equivalent in fiat currency. Since we are a long way off from being able to just use crypto (without having to convert back to fiat), try to stay as diversified across the top market cap coins as possible.   Don’t dump everything into one coin no matter how well it’s doing on that one particular day.

The largest BS is that deductible losses are capped to 3k per year, but capital gains taxes are uncapped. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:50:26
I find this really surprising.  I have been in the real estate finance business for over 10 years.   Wells Fargo has typically been the most strict with their guidelines out of all the Major Banks (Chase, Bank of America, etc).   The only way that I can see them allowing it is if you sold BTC and they could papertrail the deposit back into your account.
Depending on the type of financing you got, you may not have needed extra reserves after the down payment, so it is very likely that they backed out the BTC amount from your assets (and just told you that they used them, to stoke you out).

Yes, ledger just started supporting segwit addresses...see the below blog post:
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:26:12
Any real upside to moving BTC that has been sitting in the same address for awhile to a segwit address? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:32:03
I see where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree. A main feature  of BIP39 wallets is the fact that you can be a complete non-techie and be able to recover your wallet into a different company's wallet in the event that they go out of business or if your hardware wallet breaks. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:11:13
Did they mention anything about dropping support?
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:49:24
So all the existing transactions automatically moved into "legacy account 1"  and so forth.
When you hit the receive tab...it still shows legacy addresses by default.   Do you have to manually add another account (with your trezor plugged in), to have a segwit account?
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:14:20
Most seed word passphrases are now 24 words long, so even knowing the 24 words, the various combos to get it correct are I believe in the billions or trillions
Someone has done the math on this 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:55:50
Thanks for the clarification this makes much more sense. In my head I was like "what?! No BIP39, that makes it much more difficult for inexperienced users."
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:56:30
Supposedly with Segwit, we will have faster transactions "especially in accounts with many inputs."
Also fess are supposed to be lower with segwit transactions.   If you are just holding your coins, there isn't really a reason (that I see), to move your coins to a different address just because it is a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:32:15
We actually just passed $4600. New all time high! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:09:30
According to Trezor's blog, transactions will process faster, and the fess will be cheaper using segwit addresses.   So essentially if you are just holding onto your coins for now, there doesn't seem to be much of a reason to move your coins and pay any fees at all...
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:40:35
All time highs are almost always followed by pull backs.  The impossible thing to predict is how far it will actually pull back.  
That analyst from Goldman Sachs that predicted $4800 this month (who turned out to be correct), is also predicting a pull back to around $3000.   I'm doubting it will pull back that far, but at all time highs people are always taking profits off the table.
One thing I can tell you for certain is that I have ALWAYS come to regret selling any coin at any point in time.  Heck, even LTC that sat at like $3 for like 1.5 years is up to $75 now...
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:58:52
The majority of wallets nowadays support the same 12 or 24 seed words but definitely check before using one. I would heavily suggest a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger nano, but I have heard good things about the breadwallet for mobile. 
In my opinion based on learning that it's only compatible with its own wallet, I would only store coins there that I'm actively spending/trading. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:29:11
Apparently not, I would have assumed that the wallet would be BIP39 so it could be imported into a ledger,trezor, blockchain.info, etc. 
If breadwallet is only compatible with breadwallet, you are essentially trusting them with your BTC in a round about way. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:16:17
It's the first 4 letters. The first 3 letters of the word leaves too many repeating words and variables

Essentially the ability for the network to be able to handle more transactions per second is one of the main things that needed to be addressed to give Bitcoin the best chance for real mainstream adoption. 
A lot of this technical jargon goes way over my head too. What most users want is the ability to control their own money and move it cheaply. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:07:17
I have a couple trezors and just got a ledger nano. It all comes down to personal preference. The main upside that I can see with the trezor is that you can use the web wallet as a "watch only" wallet while your device is not connected.  This way you can monitor your balances and new deposits without connecting your device. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:03:30
Bitcoin prices have reacted well to the upgrade to segwit.  I'm hoping both BTC and BCH both thrive, but I'm happy to see prices up with segwit being official. No matter your stance on the method of scaling, I think we can all agree that it needed to be scaled in general. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:14:11
Prices on these have jumped up pretty significantly since the original launch. They are a great concept and definitely a million percent more safe than having your private seed just written on a piece of paper. If your house goes down in a fire, a lot of people have more bitcoin than the price of their homes (at current prices).

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:07:42
The fees have gotten too high and the transaction times too slow.  I have always been a long term believer in Bitcoin, but if Bitcoin's sole purpose becomes a storage of value...that paves the way for BCH or another alt coin to surpass it (sadly).    Think of any other storage of value...I.e. gold, a house, etc.   They each have a secondary use besides being a storage of value.     With Bitcoin, it has become a storage of value firstly because of its easy, fast transactional use (and low fees).   The fees have gotten out of control and the transaction times are so slow.  If people stop transacting in Bitcoin because of the slowness and the fees...it will take away from people using as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:35:07
Bitcoin Cash still needed for Coinbase accounts as well.  Would be nice to be able to purchase both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash from Coinbase, but I'm sure customers would settle for just having access to their Bitcoin Cash balances

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:50
If transaction times stay slow...and fees stay high that is very bad for Bitcoin because the main reason it has become such a great store of value was because it first provided such cheap and fast transactions.     I mean remember when we could actually do a micro transaction using bitcoin?

The initial word was that Coinbase was going to have to release identity information of clients that transacted more than $20k (in one transaction) through a specific date range. This is my friend’s email who did not transact more than $20k in one transaction, but was an early user of Coinbase. So it seems they may have scooped up early adopters in this grouping. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:14:34

Same for me...hesitant to re-add the same accounts again since Coinbase is so finicky with accounts.   I guess we are just limited to buying and selling from a desktop or laptop for now?
I was going to get some additional LTC if it makes it into low $40s...that's when I noticed this
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:22:38
Thanks, this is exactly where I’m confused a little.  So we essentially should be moving all Legacy address BTC to Segwit2x addresses just to be safe in the event of a fork, correct?  If people do nothing and leave their old paper wallets or Bitcoins on hardware wallets in legacy addresses, they wouldn’t get any of the new coins if it splits again, right?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:58:26
I'd agree to a certain degree, but its pretty early for people to be calling BCH dead after literally less than 2 months.  
Since you sound like you've been around for awhile, I'm sure you must remember how botched the Ethereum project seemed for a while with all the internal problems and worries that it may never launch at all.   And then after that (for quite a while) people that bought into the ICO were stuck with ETH that they couldn't move or do anything with for a pretty long time.   A few years later...look at it now....
Not guaranteeing BCH goes anywhere, but it's definitely in the realm of possibility, and if you didn't spend any money obtaining it, you are basically freerolling your investment.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:38:04
No, when the customer pays, they would just put $10 as the outbound transaction and the wallet would automatically send the right amount of BTC. It's up to the business owner whether or not to convert immediately to fiat or to hold the BTC.

@_date: 2017-09-11 00:05:36
This is pretty encouraging for mainstream adoption as Yelp.com has opted to display Bitcoin. They very easily could have made Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal as accepted payment options to display to customers.   I love that they chose Bitcoin instead of all of the above. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:12:08
I would get the one from Ledger directly.  I believe you can check using cryptography to verify that the Ledger isn't compromised, but that goes way above my head.   If you are only holding a couple hundred dollars worth of BTC, then 2 Ledgers probably isn't necessary.  If you are holding thousands or tens of thousands, you always want a back up. Trust me on that.

"Additional Information" should be right under the "Phone and Website" section when you are in the mobile app.   You just need to get to the screen where it allows you to indicate that you accept credit cards, and if your business is "by appointment only."  Bitcoin will be there as the third option at the bottom.   
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:08:39
If you have some additional cash that you can invest...it is always a good time if you are planning on holding it long term.   We are fresh off of some rumors of China banning Bitcoin Exchanges which has made prices come down.

Yelp.com actually has an section for business owners to show that bitcoin is accepted as a payment form. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:02:47
I believe that was when we hit the original all time high of about $1250, but it was later discovered that this was largely in part to a bot that kept placing higher buy orders. 
Then China ‘banned’ bitcoin...I think that was the first of many times China has ‘banned’ bitcoin

This is great thanks.   I think noobs should go straight to hardware wallets, in my opinion.   They are pretty foolproof especially for non-techies (which many newbies...and experience bitcoin users actually are).  
I think for newcomers to bitcoin, they should jump over the hot wallets and just learn good security practices from day 1

Bitcoin is HUGE for remittances and money transfers to people around the world.  In that regard, the fees are astronomically low in comparison to a MoneyGram or Western Union.   I agree fees have gotten too high for micropayments like BTC was originally designed to help with, but hopefully with Segwit and the creation of Bitcoin Cash, we are on the way to helping with that problem.   As a seller or service provider, BTC is awesome because you don't have to worry about checks bouncing, or chargebacks from credit cards, etc.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:47:37
Supposedly funds from their series D fund raising that just concluded are going to go towards ramping up more staff for better customer support. 
Coinbase is still the easiest/most convenient way to purchase BTC. It's a super drag that they eliminated their $1000 instant purchase per week limit. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:44:01
Historically speaking (over the past 4 years), every time Reports/rumors come out of China that Bitcoin is getting banned IT IS THE BEST TIME TO BUY.

Don’t use coinbase for microtransactions. Actually probably only use Coinbase to purchase coins, and then immediately move them into either a hardware wallet or some other wallet where you actually have control of the private keys and ultimately the BTC itself
@_date: 2017-09-11 03:55:28
Yelp's filtering mechanism definitely sucks, but when people google businesses, the Yelp reviews are usually in the top few of the search results so a ton of people use it as a factor in deciding if they are going to eat, shop, or go to a certain business.

I'm holding both for the long term.  After being in the crypto game for awhile...one thing I have learned is that I have ALWAYS come to regret selling.

He probably rolled some of these coins directly into Tezos since he was a major backer of that project.  I could’ve sworn he paid about $600 per coin back at the time the original auction took place because I remember everyone saying how he was overpaying (at that time) for the bitcoins

What are the seller side risks of accepting money as “friends and family”?  If you find someone you can trust to send you the BTC, you may be able to find someone to accept the funds as gift funds. Not sure if you can reverse a gift?
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:19:41
Yeah I know it would be super risky.   I have never traveled to Zimbabwe or anywhere near there, and I assume there are tight capital controls.    You would need to somehow link a bank account to an exchange there...but I'm sure even doing that would be a red flag both here and there.

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:30:19
yes, but the hardware is backed up by a 24 word passphrase (that you write down).  So if you lose the hardware, you can restore it using the 24 words.  
Keeping all of your BTC on your phone is pretty risky (unless it's just your gambling money)
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:56:50
It is backed by math, but the prices are backed by supply and demand.   The market used to be easily manipulated by large holders of bitcoin, but it gets harder and harder to do as the market cap grows. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:58:05
One of the original purposes of bitcoin was to allow peer to peer money transfer without a trusted third party (while also eliminating the double spend problem which prevented earlier similar attempts of digital currencies). 
Now one of the very real purposes is remittances where people don't have access to a western union or Moneygram
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:17:14
I sort of disagree. You should just make sure that you move all coins into a wallet where you control the private keys. In event of a hard fork and the creation of another alt-coin, you will also get that as well. With that being said, you may actually get some free money by investing now

IMO, it attracts new money and new investors when they see the capitalization numbers growing. People who were on the fence see Bitcoin growing and are more likely to want to get involved.  This includes institutional money as well.

For a huge percentage of cryptocoin investors, it boils down to speculation and what is turning them a profit.  I don't have any actual numbers but I would venture to say that more than 80% of ETH holders are not using smart contracts or building applications on top of the Ethereum protocol.  They are simply putting whatever amount of money in, and hoping that amount goes up.

Payment methods have reappeared without any new app update. Must have been a temporary glitch

I agree...there weren't as many haters and "know it alls" back then.   I still overall like the community, but it's so polarized between casual users and almost cult-like bitcoiners

That was my thought exactly.   When I went to the website earlier today, the price was $7250.   It would seriously be worth the plane trip there just to sell all your bitcoins and then rebuy almost 2x.

No, we’re talking like 2013-2014 when China ‘banned’ Bitcoin several times. Every time it ended up being fake news essentially

I believe these were the Bitcoins that Tim Draper bought all of.

And if you are holding more than 25+ BTC, there is a good chance you made more money on your sofa than you have at your career this year

Just make sure you don’t send BTC into BCH wallet or vice Versa. If you do that you are screwed.   Since they have the same address format some people have done this on accident

Usually a ban is temporary unless you’ve been banned multiple times. What did you receive the ban for?

Yeah I bought some but I remember thinking “how am I going to get any return when I am putting money in at the highest it had ever been”
Best decision I’ve ever made in my life

Do they have any US banks there? I know that may sound like a dumb question, but I have been to several countries that have US banks

Oh the days when Bitcoins were a couple hundred bucks and then a “China ban” would send the price tumbling like 35-40%. 
Watching charts was like an exciting thing back then.

For an absolute newcomer, I would say Coinbase is the easiest.   But as soon as you are waiting to receive your bitcoin or bitcoins, I would start researching different wallets, and then move the bitcoins off of Coinbase immediately after receiving them.

FUD = Fear Uncertainty Doubt....essentially just bad news which a lot of times turns into news that has been falsely reported
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:44:03
Me too lol. This was in Nov 2013 (pre-run up to 1200), and then dip back down to like $175
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:36:06
$334 per BTC...good investment

Yeah no kidding. At least it’s a positive article from mainstream news.  Most of the mainstream news coverage I see on Bitcoin usually comes during times of scandals or price dips
