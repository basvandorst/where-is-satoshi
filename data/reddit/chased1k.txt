Wow... criticize and make fun all you want, the fact that I get this joke means that his marketing is damn effective.

Arweave has the permaweb? Skycoin is working on a decentralized isp (be your own internet service provider through a mesh network and backbone tie in), lokinet is in the works.... am I missing any?  Someone mentioned ipfs.  What’s the one that libra modeled their setup after?  Hashgraph? Looks like they are looking at a hosting model as well.  Zeroweb
Lot of projects are looking at these things.  I am not sure where any of them are in terms of scalability and bloat etc, but I’ve been out of the loop for a while.

Oh wow. You have heard the term security theater haven’t you?  This guy is doing his job.  He may not be good at it.  He may not deserve the pay as some of you have said, but to expect someone to do better to keep you safe is poor judgement. 
Edit: too fast of fingers

I think it’s important to mention the [privacy concerns associated with bisq](  and especially the importance of avoiding coin merge (as outlined in that post on the bisq blog). 
What I took this to mean was never let your bisq wallet touch a wallet that hasn’t been mixed if chain analysis is a concern of yours, so bisq trade straight to -&gt; green (I.e do not use bisq internal wallet for trades)  -&gt; wasabi / samurai-&gt; coin mixing -&gt; newly created wallet... or something of the like.  
And I mention this, because I think the step after KYC would be CA.

They are referring to people using exchanges as banks and trusting them with their funds.  Not your keys, not your coins.  Decentralized is the strength... this muscle needs to be flexed regularly.  I believe that is what they refer to when they say “a run on the exchanges”.  Pull your coins and hold them yourself.

Ohhhh Buddy... he said nothing of the sort.  He said that he does not like how our Monetary policy is run.  That has not been by government since 1913 (Not the important parts at least).  I love your attitude of “get up off your ass and change it”. “If you don’t like your government it is your responsibility to change things”. I do.  It’s admirable and honorable and what the ethic of our country stands for.  And... it doesn’t apply here.

I tried to upvote you multiple times. Haha

It’s a great book. I noted to myself how much basic economic groundwork was being laid before even touching on bitcoin.  All interesting.  Not difficult. Really a great read, especially if your only exposure to economics has been Keynesian (very likely).... by the way... I may be a bit of a nerd since my autocorrect automatically put Keynesian in for me... 
It’s pushed me to read more from the Austrian School of economics.  Rothbard’s Man, Economy, and State is in my near future.

Looking forward to this.

Thank you, sir.  I agree.

Lost redditors? ... they can just opt for a different system who’s inflation is written in code and protected by cryptography?

Onramp exchanges like coinbase? For shure.  Had to walk a friend through how to setup his first wallet when he called me the first day he was in the green after buying btc a year ago.

Came her to say roughly this.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:17:48
Thank you.
Edit:  definitely worth watching the whole talk.

Do you honestly think that people would just... not spend money if it weren’t for inflation?  I honestly don’t understand how it can be good for the economy... I mean I’ve taken the classes, I’ve read the books, I did the homework... and I’ve also looked at other monetary policies and followed economists that don’t line up with Keynes... and I honestly don’t get the concept of “we need to stimulate spending”... and “war is good for the economy”... of course if you are outsourcing debt and weapons, both of those things can be true for your situation, but what about all the externalities of this single policy?  It’s ludicrous to me.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:01:35
Fair point. There are some who may see “can be inflated to take value from all of those that use it without their knowledge” as an important spec.  ;p and I think you are asking a fundamentally important question that not enough people ask about much in the world of money and politics.

What’s funny is someone called an inverted Bart Simpson on the other roller coaster post.

I haven’t tried view source, but I imagine that works as well... thanks for that suggestion. Clever.

Funny, this is the same story from my childhood when my mother could bench more than me the first time I went to the gym... if my history is informative of your future in any way you will be a very rich man
