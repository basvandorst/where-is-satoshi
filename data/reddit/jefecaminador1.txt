It's against the law to tip them off that they're under investigations for potential money laundering, duh.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:14:11
Europe doesn't have anti money laundering laws?
Also if a company conducts business in the US, they have to follow US laws even if they are based in another country.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:30:51
You do not know the law. Banks are not allowed to reveal anything to a customer about any potential red flags or extra processing time related to anti-money laundry activities, even if there is no formal investigation. That's called tipping and you can be fined or face criminal charges for it.

No, the graph is right, there has been no growth in usage over the past year. I don't know why that plus the steady decline in price does not make you pessimistic in your outlook. Its the early stages, it should be showing big growth still, not flat or in decline. I was actually pretty surprised myself, it was the first time I looked at that data.

Duh, he's doing it now because 10% of nothing is nothing. As soon as he sees any kind of sales volume he'll probably have to discontinue because it's hurting his profitability. Especially if it's just shifting sales from CC to bitcoin and not creating new sales.

The scary part comes when there is no inflation of the supply.

A question that I want to ask, that you might not have an answer for, but won't be a douche about it. What's the end game for bitcoin? If it goes down the path of regulation and becomes part of big business, what's ultimately the point of having it? It will be equivalent of using USD in practice, so what's the advantage? Is it really just for lower transaction fees? Once bitcoin really gets established I feel like those fees will end up being approximately the same, that or small time businesses will be completely shut out, as there is no trusted third party to mediate purchasing goods from them. People won't buy from a company they haven't heard of before because there's a good chance it's a scam and the consumer has 0 recourse. Our current payment system has a ton of benefits to it, I just don't see a compelling reason to use bitcoins instead once the whole ecosystem gets established. Especially since transaction costs will go up once there are no more free BTC from mining.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:55:19
And chances are circle will deny you purchase at some point as well. Will you cry about it then as well and switch back? You seem to have a weird opinion of what violates trust, it's not like they stole your cash. Will you quit Bitcoin the first time you pay for something and don't get it? Cause if that happens you really did have your trust violated with non-reversible transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:14:34
Great, if you own all the bitcoins nobody else will have any and they'll have no value. Better yet, nobody will be mining, so unless you have a lot of processors to keep the network up, some douchebag can take over the blockchain and give all your coins to himself.
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:11:53
He can afford to give a 10% discount on bitcoin purchases because sales through that avenue are so low anyway. If he actually got a large volume of sales he'd prolly discontinue them. He is basically trying to subsidize the bitcoin system in the hope it will grow to the point that subsidizes are no longer necessary. He hopes other will subsidize as well.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:52:11
I agree, Bitcoin is showing amazing growth in real world usage. Just look at the transactions per day over the past year. Its amazing...
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:15:48
No, the number of bitcoins being transacted is important as is their USD value equivalent. Raw number of transactions is not the whole picture. The total amount of bitcoins transacted is flat for the past year, and their USD value has fallen. People maybe making more transactions but they are purchasing less valuable stuff.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:15:56
I already get 2% cash back when paying with a credit card+ protection if a merchant tries to screw me. Plus I'd have to go out and buy bitcoins from some place. Not worth it, unless they are offering 5+% discounts... Which they won't, because they are better off paying CC fees than discounting 5%. 
There is literally no use case for bitcoins in the vast majority of users. The only real use case for bitcoins is exchanges between two non-business entities, like tipping a stranger on reddit. Which, honestly, isn't that big of a market.

Interesting article, not sure it really supports your idea that deflation in general is a good thing. He cites that there were 6 instances where there was both deflation and economic expansion at the same time. My take from this would be, there is not one recorded incident in the 80+ years of  pre-keynesian monetary policy data,  of a multi-year period that shows both deflation and economic expansion, yet there have been quite a few periods of both inflation and economic expansion. Also, all 6 examples cited occurred at the beginning of economic expansions according to the author, or conversely, at the end of contractions.  This would at least suggest that it could be merely a timing differential as the deflationary price affects of the prior contraction had yet to be reversed  by the ensuing expansion. 
Also notable is this paragraph.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2004) published estimates that show CPI
was negative for 11 years in the late nineteeth century, including 1879 and
1895. The NBER chronology shows the economy was in expansion for nine
months in 1879 and 11 months in 1895 despite a negative CPI both years. 
He cites that there were 11 instances of negative CPI, and out of those 11, only 2 occurred during periods of expansion, and those 2 occurred at beginning of an economic expansion, not during the middle of it. Meaning, 9 times out of 11 when there was negative CPI growth, there was an economic contraction. Not sure you get much of a better argument than that.

And at that point the price is so low it's no longer economical for most people to mine. Miners leave in a mass exodus leaving 1 entity in control of over 50% of the network. They then double spend and try to extract as much USD value out of the system while they still have time, bitcoins crash to 0 within a week.
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:22:01
Yeah, it's pretty sweet when you can let others foot the bill for maintaining your network and don't have to pay them anything.

Because they are currently being subsidized by free bitcoins. Fees will have to increase in the future as the difficulty increases and the amount of free bitcoins decreases. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:02:32
It cost money to mine. If the price isn't high enough there is an economic incentive to not mine. Duh. The low cost producer(s) will be the last ones left, if they control more than 50% of the network they do whatever they want. We've already seen how specialized mining has become and it will only continue to become more specialized in the future. There will be less and less miners in the future, and if there is a price shock to the downside (or every 4 years when miner reward gets cut in half) you can see enough drop out that 1 entity can control 50%.
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:05:01
Except total number of bitcoins actually transacting is flat. And their value is down. All this means is that more small transactions are taking place.

@_date: 2014-10-22 22:11:44
The devil is in the details, except satoshi made sure it would be years before all the details came out. People are drawn to Bitcoin in part because of its fixed supply, except you know, the supply is actually increasing right now. It's an inflationary currency at the moment that is being used to subsidize the work needed to run the system. The end state when all coins will be mined is vastly different from what the current state is, and nobody can predict what consequences those will entail. There's no way to prove that a deflationary currency can work, and conviently we won't find out until much later.
@_date: 2014-09-26 14:15:03
Dur, yet people don't think Bitcoin will collapse. It's inevitable that someone will get control of the block chain as mining becomes unprofitable and then the whole system collapses. It's silly to think some random guy came up with a perfect currency on his first try that can be used indefinatelyinto the future. Bitcoin can't remain uncontrolled, eventually someone will have complete power over it, and try to use that power to screw everyone else, causing the system to collapse.

@_date: 2014-10-05 16:22:08
How? All bitcoin is doing is replicating existing services. Literally every merchant just receives bit coins and immediately converts to fiat. Online shopping is not being revolutionized by bitcoin, it's just another payment option that is (arguably, which I would) inferior to credit cards.  The only real use for bitcoin has been between two non-business entities. Its great for people that already have bitcoin and want to give money to other people that already have bitcoin, but have no store set up. But even then, you already have things like paypal for that.
Bitcoin is nowhere near as revolutionary as the internet was. Shit, just having aol instant messenger was way more valuable than having bitcoin is. If you want to compare bitcoin to something, maybe compare it to amazons one click? It's just another payment option, but with huge externalities involved and security left to the user instead of a third party. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:32:57
And total number of transactions have been a good leading indicator? No, it hasn't either. The fact of the matter is there hasn't been any meaningful increase in the value of what's being transacted over the past year. More transactions is not the end all be all of revelvant statistics.

And miners are being subsidized by free bitcoins. What's your point? Fees will eventually go up for bitcoin services as well, right now a lot of these exchange providers are losing money in the hopes of building marketshare and being profitable later. And how will they be profitable, by charging fees of course! Who knows what those will ultimately be, but don't be surprised if it ends up being around 2-3%. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:36:51
I know, the whole thing is pretty retarded. All this infrastructure going up around Bitcoin is just emulating processes we already have in place. And they charge fees, just like banks do.... So what's the point? If 99% of transactions are going to be through places like circle and all merchants that accept bitcoins will immediately convert them to fiat (with a fee) what's the point exactly?
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:39:45
They wouldn't be mad if the price was rising, but since it isn't, "it doesn't matter".
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:50:20
OK, so what happens if credit card companies lower their fees, and mining stops producing free bitcoins and miners impliment transaction fees? Is there any point to this arrangement at all? Convert from USD to BTC and then from BTC back to USD? Or you could... you know, just skip that step and pay with USD. This argument for using bitcoins isn't very compelling.

Satoshi made this 4 years ago, we have more information now than he did then. Mining will soon become an oligopoly as scale increases. We're already seeing it happen. Those miners will then control the market and everyone else will be at their mercy. You've put blind faith into a system created by one man, you've put your faith that he was able to create something that couldn't be exploited, even though it is nigh impossible for him to see all the possible ways it could be. And you've put your faith into a group of people you don't even know, and who are accountable to no one, not screwing you over in the future. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:55:38
The biggest draw back with bitcoin is not that it's a deflationary currency, right now, but that it will be one in the future. Bitcoins are constantly being added to the system and will continue to be for years. You have yet to see the problems with a deflationary currency, and won't until bitcoin becomes so well developed that it will cause massive pain when the effects start to set in. The whole ecosystem right now is being powered by the inflationary free bitcoins gained from mining. It's foolish to believe that everything will be just rosy when that spigot is shut off.

@_date: 2014-10-03 04:13:13
its grasping at straws. Bitcoin enthusiasts spout things like remittance (which they will never use themselves) and no charge-backs (which is actually a benefit for consumers that CC companies put in as a feature)  as reasons why bitcoin will rise. They do this because an actual use case doesn't exist. Virtually no economic activity is taking place using bitcoins. Its all converting USD to bitcoin, spending bitcoin to very few merchants, who immediately convert back to USD. There is literally no point in doing this. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:14:24
Well in the future there will be no free bit coins for miners so they will have to implement transaction fees. And credit card companies make a shit ton of money, so they can easily lower fees if they have a reason to. But maybe you don't know what highly unlikely means... I guess that's why you're a bit ion supporter in the first place.

Bitcoin miners are also subsidized ~3% of transaction volume through free bitcoins. Overtime this will become transaction fees instead. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:26:50
And if all mining was cut by 95%, one entity would control over 50% of the network, making Bitcoin worthless.
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:31:40
Yeah, I'm sure you've done great risk analysis. Lose money 99% of the time and hope that 1% pays off. You're betting on a system where people have to make paper wallets so all their shit doesn't get stolen, where probably 10% of all coins have already been lost forever. And for what benefit? Lower transaction costs? Just wait until the market matures and there are no free bitcoins to be mined, and the whole economy is controlled by a few mining conglomerates, transaction costs will be much higher than they are now. The misguided hope that bitcoins will skyrocket because there is a fixed supply? Bitcoins will take the place of the dollar so each one of your coins will be worth over a million?
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:34:53
Yes that's true, which will drive consolidation in mining. If you're a miner that has the lowest cost of production (through efficient machines and low cost of energy) why wouldn't you keep expanding? As long as it's more profitable for you to do so you will. This drives others out of the market as they have higher costs than you do and can't compete. So mining becomes concentrated in few actors. Then if you have a price drop so that even more miners drop out you can see someone who had ~5% of the mining market go to 50% quite rapidly. Even if it was only due to a temporary price decline, it only has to happen once before the whole system integrity is compromised. Difficulty also only resets every 2 weeks so it's not a continuous  function.

Block chain the technology can be separated from bitcoin, it's been done countless times already, is the point I'm trying to make.

@_date: 2015-01-14 19:12:57
And this is why Bitcoin will fail. There already exists so much mining capacity that the network can't affoard to have the price decline and have most of the miners quit. It creates too many players would can easily get 51% of the network. The whole system was designed so that it enevitably fails. Which isn't surprising, because it was just one dude making the whole thing, he either did it intentionally or didn't have the foresight to see this problem. It's hard to anticipate every little thing that could go wrong until it has become painfully obvious. Bitcoin was built up by giving away free money, and it requires ever more free money to keep it going, unfortunately that isn't sustainable.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:29:02
So what you're saying is it does matter. If the price goes to 0 people will stop mining and the network will be worthless/subject to attack at any time because mining capacity dwarfs those who would actually still be mining.

That's the problem, the system never becomes self sustaining because of the way it is set up. There is no way transaction fees can replace the block reward without it costing too much for participants. And there's no safe way for mining difficulty to naturally decrease as there is too much capacity built up already.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:50:50
That's a very dangerous assumption to make. Bitcoin the currency is more like a single network on the Internet. Normally it would be the long term winner due to its first mover advantage, but the fact that it has a market value which can change and cause losses makes a huge difference. The reason why the web succeeded, and not replaced by something similar was because you could incrementaly add to it, and even if individual sights didn't perform, it didn't affect the whole. There was never any compelling reason to try something else. With Bitcoin that is simply not the case. Because it is setup with specific rules, which basically can't be changed, and it is traded with a market value it absolutely can fail and wipe out the network with it. It's more like a peer to peer file sharing service than the web. And we've seen tons of those come and go, it doesn't mean the technology won't survive, just that this implementation of it wont. And that's a very dangerous thing if you have real money invested into it.

The timeframe you are trying to protect your purchasing power over is not 5000 years. It is probably 30-50 years at most. This matters. Gold has increased in value by about 7x over the last 13 years or so. Over this timeframe gold has been a poor store of value compared to paper currencies. Sure, 1000 years from now gold may buy you approximately the same amount of goods as it does now, but it will fluctuate much more than paper currency over the next couple of decades. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:45:49
You don't get charged as a consumer using a credit card online, in fact with rewards points you get 1-1.5% back usually. The merchant ends up paying the 3% fee. 
And don't act like there are no fees associated with bitcoin either. Unless you store your wealth in bitcoin, everytime you make a transaction you first have to buy bitcoins. You're paying a fee there. If your merchant is using bitinstant there is a 1% fee there too. Not to mention your exchange rate risk between when you purchase your bitcoins and when you purchase your item, considering the high volatility in bitcoin that is a cost as well. And thats not even taking account into the transaction fee you have to pay the miners, which is currently being subsidized by the free btc they get from completing a block, but it won't be free forever. Then transaction fees will go up even more. And if you want to buy something in person? You're paying there too as you have to wait a freakin long time for your transaction to be verified. Even if it ends up being less expensive to use bitcoin, its not nearly cheap enough to put up with all the additional hassles associated with its use. 
And personally, i don't give two shits if my credit card company knows what i'm buying. That information is basically worthless. Plus they provide various other services that maybe arent worth much but are nice to have. I can look up all my transactions in the last year really easily and see where i spent my month. That has some value. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:43:02
We are not talking about value or how much a bitcoin is worth. We are talking about individuals desire to increase the nominal amount of bitcoins they own. The have 1 today, they'd like to have 2 tomorrow. If everyone in the world owned 1 bitcoin today, and would like 2 tomorrow, it would be impossible because the supply is fixed. This is what I mean by saving, increasing your nominal holdings of bitcoins, I don't care what you can buy for them. All I care about is increasing the amount that I have. And the problem is, on the whole, people would like to increase their nominal holdings of bitcoins. This desire to increase their nominal holdings is what causes a lot of the problems. And that is why having an exogenous government spend money into existence solves many problems. It satiates peoples desire to increase their nominal holdings of the currency.  
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:38:06
No, i am saying, if you save 1685 satoshis, where did that come from? It came from someone else, which means their savings decreased by the same amount. The problem is, everyone (in aggregate) likes to save. This is impossible because the supply is constant. It has nothing to do with inflation or deflation, it is an accounting identity, and it has real world implications. 
EDIT: hypothetical situation. The economy has 2 people in it, you and me. We have 10$ each. We agree that one hour of work is worth 1$. You decide you'd like to buy 10 hours of work from me, and by coincidence I also decide I'd like to buy 10 hours of work from you. Great, our trade perfectly balances and we each work 10 hours that week and our expenses exactly balance our income Now you decide in a couple months you'd like to take vacation so you want to save a couple of $. You think that I will want to buy 10 hours of work from you, so in order to increase your savings you decide to only buy 9 hours of work from me, and therefore save a $. So the next week i buy 10 hours of work from you and you buy 9 hours of work from me. Now you have 11$ and I only have 9$. I start to get a little nervous because my store of wealth has gone down, and I decide to get some back by saving. This week I think you'll only buy 9 hours from me, so I decide ok, my income has gone down to 9$ a week and I want to save, I'll only buy 8 hours of work from you. Now at the end of the week my savings has again increased to 10$ and you're savings has fallen back to 10$. But you still desire to save. Therefore since you think I'll only buy 8 hours from you, you decide that in order to save money you'll only buy 7 hours of work from me. This process continues adfininum until we either dont get any work, or we decide this is stupid and build a better model. This is exactly what causes deflationary spirals. People desire to save in the currency of exchange and thus cut back on their spending to increase their savings which just spirals back and crushes the economy. 
Its not spending that drives the economy, its the desire to save and show profit. I WANT to produce more goods and services so I can save, so that at a latter date I can spend if I need/want to.

The economy is composed of 2 people me and you. We each have 5$ and there is no other money in the system. We both want to increase our savings to 6$, how do we accomplish this? Answer, it's impossible.
Now there are 3 people in the economy, you me and Sally. We each have 5$, and we each want to increase our savings to 6$. How do we accomplish this? Answer, it's impossible.
Now there are 20 people in the economy each with 5$, we each want to increase our savings to 6$, how do we accomplish this? Answer it's impossible.
Now there are a million people in the economy each with 5$, we each want to increase our savings to 6$. How do we accomplish this? Answer it's impossible.
Now, what do you think are the consequences of people who want to increase their savings in a fixed supply of currency in an economy? Everyone wants to go from 5$ to 6$. What do they try to get there?

Ok, so if theres not enough transaction fees to make it profitable to mine, miners will drop out. Doesn't this set up well for a 51% attack? If it ever becomes unprofitable to mine *at any point in time* it sets up a situation where enough miners might temporarily stop processing transactions so that a coordinated group could take over the blockchain.

So you don't trust "the government" but you do trust "your fellow man"? That seems illogical. The government is nothing more than a collection of people. The may have more power, and power does corrupt, but we have a system of checks and balances in place and we "know" who works for the government. We group together and form societies with laws for a reason... It works out better for all of us when we do. Sure, it's not perfect and people abuse their power, but it's much better than the alternative. I think it's absurd to not trust "the government" and yet think those unconstrained by laws will act in the best manner for the group.

Are you saying that money is not at all times owned by a specific individual? That is not true. Any transaction in the economy exactly balances. If you spend 1 btc to buy a cow from person B, you now have 1 less btc and they have 1 more. This is true for all transactions. All savings that person A obtains must come from some combination of B + C + D etc. It does not come from some pool of circulation, it directly comes from an identifiable individual. How would the blockchain work otherwise?

So answer me this then, who is DECREASING their savings by 1 then .9 .8 .7 ect? When do they run out of money? It can't be some mystery, it has to be an actual actor in the economy. And why would they continually let their savings decrease?
Edit: Also, please stop focusing on deflation, I think it is preventing you from seeing my point. Assume the value does not change.

No, the newly issued money most definitely goes to someone. In our system the government spends money into existence, in exchange they get something in return, F22s, labor from government employees whatever. It doesn't just magically appear in a bank, they give it to someone in exchange for a service.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:46:08
No, you don't understand. People want to increase the amount of bitcoins they own. Irrespective of the value of bitcoins, because the value of bitcoins is largely out of their control. What they can control is increasing their nominal holdings. And so that is what they try to do. They try to obtain more bitcoins. They don't just trade equal amounts of bitcoins that they work for for equal amounts of goods of others. And if they can't obtain more bitcoins than they spend, they reduce their spending until are able to increase their holdings. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:31:22
It is true that in our current economy the people are able to save in aggregate. And they are able to save precisely because the money supply is increasing. In fact their net savings in dollars is exactly equal to the number of new dollars created! Now are you starting to understand?
The fundamental problem I'm trying to address here is that in aggregate people wish to increase the nominal amount of currency they want to hold, and that is impossible unless you are increasing the supply of that currency.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:26:13
You are completely missing my point, I am not talking about how much a bitcoin is worth. I'm talking about the very mechanical process of how one increases their total holdings. How they go from 1 btc to 1.1 btc. Not how much that btc is worth but physically going from 1 to 1.1. Since the supply is fixed, it is impossible for someone to go from 1 btc to 1.1 btc without someone else going from 1 btc to .9 btc. Thus PROFIT in the entire system when measured in btc is 0 at all times. Which makes it very hard to run a business. People want to increase their btc holdings from 1 to 1.1 irrespective of what their value might change by. They want more! They want to save! I am not talking about the value of their btc increasing and thus allowing them to purchase more goods, I am talking about them wanted to increase the actual NUMBER of btc they own! Which is IMPOSSIBLE by identity. This desire to increase their nominal holdings causes major problems.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:36:07
I am not talking about wealth or value at all. I am talking about the inability to show a profit in aggregate in a currency that is fixed. Nobody could save even .000001 bitcoins... ever. Not now, not in 10 years and it is completely independent of the price or value of the bitcoin. It doesn't matter what the value of the bitcoin is, what matters is that the economy as a whole can not show a profit in bitcoin because it is fixed. This has serious implications for an economy because it impairs the main incentive, which is to profit.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:10:15
The whole point of having a third party you can trust is so that 2 independent parties can transact with one another without having to trust each other.... The whole reason to have banks is because you "know" who they are, and it is more profitable for them if they are trustworthy. This is why I don't really get the whole point of bitcoin, it fixes perceived problems by creating larger ones. 
Instead of placing your trust in a government, you are placing your trust not only in today's miners, but potential future miners who you have no idea what their motives will be. Instead of placing your trust in a network of banks, you are transacting with individuals you have no recourse against. 
I mean it's cool you can send money online anonymously and less expensively, but there are tons of drawbacks to get those 2 (and really only) benefits.

And even if you prune it to only unspent coins, if it becomes fully adopted you could be looking at something like 50-100 billion addresses that need to be kept track of as people will be using multiple keys. And then you have to have several nodes dedicated to storing the entire block chain. This will eventually become untenable, but don't say that too loudly, we need the bubble to inflate higher first.
Guys, some random dude designed a currency completely by himself and put it out in the wild. Do you really think he made it perfect the first time without any flaws? I find it highly unlikely he foresaw all possible problems that would make it unusable in the long run.

The only people who lost money who put it in a bank were those that fell asleep for decades. Everyone else got to enjoy the real fruits of the economy over that time period. Do we really want to make winners of those who sit around for years and years at a time doing nothing? 
Think about it, if you have a fixed money supply, how is everyone supposed to save? On the whole, people like to spend less than they make, thus saving. This becomes impossible under a fixed money supply, as one party cannot save without another party dis-saving by the same amount. This is the flaw with money in general. You either have perfectly balanced trade, you let the government spend new money into the economy or let people go into debt. All of which have negative consequences, and only government spending new money is sustainable.

Ok, you are still missing my point. You want to increase your savings of bitcoins. I also want to increase my savings of bitcoins. Mary wants to increase her savings in bitcoins. NOT IN THEIR IMPLIED VALUE BUT IN THE ACTUAL NOMINAL AMOUNT OF BITCOINS. I have 10 this year, I want 11 next year. You also have 10 and want 11. Everyone in the world has 10 and wants 11. How do we get that to happen? Its IMPOSSIBLE because the supply is fixed! How then do people increase their savings in bitcoins? They CAN'T. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? Further, do you understand the implied consequences of people's desire to increase their nominal savings in a currency that is fixed?

Who said they were consuming what was produced? Lets say the hour of worked produced 2 fish, but they only needed to eat one fish per hour worked to survive. Therefore in the first week they produced 40 fish and consumed 20 fish for net savings of 20 fish. But since they desire to save dollars instead of fish, the economy still collapses even though there is plenty of fish to go around. 
Admittedly the example is pretty bad, but hopefully that kinda illustrates the point. Money =! real goods. And your choice of money supply has real consequences to it in the real economy. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:08:00
What is your savings denominated in? It surely isn't bitcoins because the number of bitcoins in circulation has remained the same. You may have more physical goods, but you don't have more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:36:53
Except if nominal interest rates were negative there would simply be no loans issued, as lenders would have a higher return by simply keeping their bitcoins. This is why bitcoins won't work. You basically can't have a banking system where people borrow and lend money in a deflating environment. This means that projects that require long lead times don't get done. ( think building skyscrapers or new plants) No monetary system is perfect. When you think about the economy you really need to think of it as two separate layers, the first layer is the real economy where real goods and services are produced. The second layer is the money layer, which is governed by accounting and math rules. In the real economy there are less rules on what can happen. There are less degrees of freedom in the money layer as everything must balance mathematically, therefore when you try to combine the two layers you get weird interactions. Ultimately the solution is not finding the perfect monetary system, it is to find a way to do away with money altogether. Unfortunately that is damn difficult, you need a way to allocate resources among people, how to trade without a fixed medium of exchange and how to signal increases in demand/supply. Other than that, you don't need money to produce anything, it's not real.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:40:57
So is there a difference between someone losing bitcoins, and someone who hasn't lost them, but just never spends them? How does the market know when a bitcoin has been lost? You are over simplifying the situation.

So to combat fear of 2% *per year* inflation you are going to buy a largely untested online currency that regularly fluctuates more than 2% *a day*? Seems highly illogical. Look there is nothing out there that is a guaranteed store of value in the future, thats just not how the world works. However, it is MUCH more likely that the JPY holds the great majority of its value over the next several years than it is BTC retains its value. 
Think about what you're trying to accomplish, what course of action is more likely to accomplish those goals and what are the potential consequences. Trying to avoid 2% inflation by buying something that could very realistically be worth 0 in 5 years is a pretty bad trade off if you're simply trying to preserve purchasing power.   
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:09:03
Ok, but how do people obtain savings in a world where the money supply never increases? Remember, if you build a car or a TV, you're not making money, you're making a product which you then exchange for money. Since money can't be created, either nobody saves, or some people dissave to balance out those that do. Since people in aggregate desire to save, a static money supply becomes untenable.
Think of it on a smaller scale. There are 10 people in the economy with 10 dollars each, except 1 guy with 11$ so 101$ total. The other guys are jealous and want 11$ too, how do they get it? The answer is, not all of them can, because there are only 101$ total. It is impossible for them to increase their savings unless one of them spends more than the take in. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:32:04
No, it is impossible for them to save 1 nominal bitcoin, period. I am not talking about the value of the bitcoin. I am talking about the dumbest case here, actually physically increasing their nominal amount of bitcoins that they own. It is impossible. Don't you see that A B and C can't increase their savings in bitcoins? The supply is fixed, any increased savings by 1 individual must by identity come from another individual. The problem still remains that in aggregate people desire to increase their nominal holdings of bitcoins. This is impossible by identity. And this is where many of the problems stem from, people desire to increase their nominal amount of currency they hold.

Savings imply that your nominal holdings increase. Are you trying to say that day 1 person A has 1 bitcoin total, and on day two they have .9 bitcoins total? That is dissaving, not saving. If you are trying to say that on day 1 they INCREASE their bitcoin holdings by 1 and on day 2 they increase by .9, then this is impossible because the supply is fixed. 
I think you need to think of it more simply than you are. You are trying to think in terms of value, you need to think strictly in nominal terms.

That's why it's so dangerous to put a large amount of wealth in bitcoin. The chances that some dude randomly created a perfect currency on his first attempt is very low.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:14:03
Because you make transactions using a quantity of money. This isn't a discussion of value at all! Trade is a mechanical process where currency is exchanged for real goods are services. We are not talking about the VALUE of the currency, we are talking about the mechanical process of obtaining more currency. The VALUE of your btc might increase, but it is physically impossible for everyone to increase the NUMBER of btc they own. Do you agree with this statement? You can not physically increase the quantity of btc that you own when the quantity is fixed?
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:18:05
What is this mythical ether of bitcoins just floating around come from? Every bitcoin is already owned by someone. Money doesn't just circulate around ready to be snatched up by someone, it is already controlled by some individual. In order for someone to save, someone else has to dissave by that same amount, it does not appear out of nowhere. 
In order for you to earn 10 btc, someone must spend exactly 10 btc. If you spend less than 10 btc that means someone out there earned less than 10 btc, if you saved 1 btc that means someone dissaved 1 btc. This is a closed system. It is the monetary equivalent of Newton's 3rd law of motion. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:21:38
Ok, but that 1 btc you saved comes from someone else. That person has dissaved by the exact amount you have saved. Therefore saving in aggregate is 0. The problem is that in aggregate people desire to save. Do you understand what I'm saying?  
It is the attempt to SAVE that causes deflationary spirals.

First gold is not fixed, it's supply increases all the time. Second, it's a freakin math identity, your trying to argue 1+1 doesn't equal 2, when you say you can save in a fixed supply of something. If we have 10 sticks that we use for money, and there are no trees around, can we "save" more than 10 sticks? Obviously not. It's the same thing, all you can do is shuffle the sticks around, nobody can increase their holdings of sticks without someone else giving up theirs. This actually causes real severe problems in an economy because people like to save in the currency they use as a medium of exchange!

Stop thinking in terms of value and inflation or deflation. Think of it in the dumbest way possible.

That seems like a horribly simplified explanation and not what the real long term impact would be. For example, the market won't KNOW when bitcoins are lost, so how would it automatically compensate with a price increase. Also, doesn't this give people incentive to try to come up with ways of destroying/making inaccessible other people's bitcoins? It may be easier to do that rather than try and steal them. I think a lot more thought needs to into this.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:24:03
Right, but you can't have more people holding bitcoins because their are so few in circulation and most people are hoarding. There are maybe a few hundred thousand bitcoins actually being circulated... Hard to run an economy on that little money. And the hoarders won't sell unless the price rises. Which just ends up being a huge transfer of wealth to speculators.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:35:11
That is not my implication at all, if more dollars are printed their value will obviously go down.

@_date: 2013-04-23 01:57:48
I'm sorry you are offended, but maybe once you take the time to think about it, you'll see that I am correct. 
The problem is that all currency is inherently fiction, you can not store real value in it, you can only use it to represent value. And currency follows the strict rules of math, while real production is much less limited. There is a difference between trying to save in a fictional currency and trying to increase your real wealth. The problem is that since the currency is the medium of exchange, and all real goods are denominated in that currency, its natural for people to try to obtain more of that currency to increase their buying power. And this is by definition impossible in a fixed currency and thats why there are so many problems using it. This is also true in currencies that are allowed to expand as well, just to a lessor degree. The desire to save is not constant in magnitude over time and so even expansionary currencies can suffer from the same demand destruction that lead to economic contraction.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:12:20
