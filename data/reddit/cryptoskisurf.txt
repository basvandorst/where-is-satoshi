When I went to Argentina for cheap, it was 3 pesos to 1 dollar.
Shit was dope.
Now I found out it's 17 pesos to 1 dollar.
When you are living in fiat, and you see the world in fiat... you don't see the temperature being turned up slowly. Healthcare, food, gas, utilities, education, real estate all have gone up. 
It's easier to accept gradual loss of purchasing power, which is why fiat worked for as long as it did.

You put in a market order. You can't really complain.
It's like yelling in a crowded room.. "I WILL HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED", and now you're upset with the person who came forward.
That's a market order.

You mean US dollars?
Lol, I get those every 2 weeks, and I believe only 6% of US dollars actually exist in physical form.  
Now back to those btc... you said only 21 million will exist?
Fuck dollars.

Explain how the hell Society is ok with consistent and gradual erosion of purchasing power?
Went off gold standard in the 70s? check.. Constant "printing" of dollars (in actuality only 6% of dollars exist physically)..
BTC and cryptos are more sound money than fiat.. As people use the tech, they see their usefulness and the market decides on it's worth.
Look up: **Reverse of Gresham's Law (Thiers' Law)**


There is no obligation to settle debts in btc. It's system is entirely voluntary and it's market is entirely liquid. 
This is no bubble.

No it's not a train wreck.. it's an actual train. You can get down in a sketchy part when it's dipping, or you can get off at utopia above 1 million.
Buy the dip!

Fiat isn't going away anytime soon, and neither is monopoly money.
Both are easy to acquire.

Fiat is collapsing to irrelevance.. game theory is at play here. 
Look up Gresham's law or Thiers Law.
i'm copy pasting from wiki cuz im lazy
The experiences of dollarization in countries with weak economies and currencies (for example Israel in the 1980s, Eastern Europe and countries in the period immediately after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, or South American countries throughout the late 20th and early 21st century) may be seen as Gresham's Law operating in its reverse form (Guidotti &amp; Rodriguez, 1992), because in general the dollar has not been legal tender in such situations, and in some cases its use has been illegal.
Adam Fergusson pointed out that in 1923, during the great Inflation in the Weimar Republic Gresham's Law began to work in reverse, as the official money became so worthless that virtually nobody would take it. This was particularly serious because farmers began to hoard food. Accordingly, any currencies backed by any sorts of value became the circulating mediums of exchange.[17] In 2009, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began to show similar characteristics.
These examples show that, in the absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, in the absence of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.

1 Country may ban it, and create a black market for crypto.. driving up the price of crypto in that country, but you aren't going to get every country on earth to ban crypto.
