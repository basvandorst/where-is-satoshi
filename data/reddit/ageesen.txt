News aggregation from most large sites, shapeshift, block explorer, merchant directory and a few more just to start?  We are going to start pushing in r/bitcoin posts as well soon.....

Interesting thought: Banks are probably best poised to take advantage of disrupting technology.  Tons of capital, intellectual resources and connections.  
But things happen fast.  Can they keep up?

The word you're looking for is aware.  You're not new, making comments about the posts right after it happened and hunting this thread down to troll? 
Not going to comment on the rest of your reply.

This is a cash fiat infrastructure business based on existing technologies.  We're not building a blockchain, we're building a business.  We will open source stuff over the coming months and years, like our super fast batch method of ETH and ERC20 withdraws that saves tons of money.  Developed for custom use for our huge amount of users.  You're looking like a troll for life, so keep watching.  Thanks.

In 6 years we have multiple products, businesses,  and investments.  Some big wins during this time with companies built and exited.  The crypto hodl is strong in our group.  Our team co-organizes meetups with hundreds of attendees for years in Toronto.  In combination we have over 10,000+ members in Canada and India alone. Next event is April 19th. I'm sure you know that.  Would be kind of you to talk to me in person about your grievances.  I've always been public and a crypto evangelist for years.  More than half a decade. I'm not stopping.  
My continued thanks for the opportunity to discuss.

We can work out an alt-ambassador ucash compensation plan. I'm sure you have an account on our portal?  Send me the user ID and we can chat.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:34:02
They don't even reply to me.  I've tried multiple times over the last month and a half.  
The only advice I can give is keep trying, hopefully they will get back to you sometime.  They do interact with Social Media, and frequently read some of this stuff.

It's called Alexa Ranking.  You should try it and see the volume we got starting mid December to March.  Off the charts.  Put us in the top 21,000 sites in the planet for a while there.  You should also browse some Vietnamese forums and see what we're doing there.... some kind of new type of virality.  Indonesia is going crazy too.  India, Russia and many other countries on top.  Most don't even speak english, but our community gets translations done for them, including posts and videos.  
Social media wise we have hundreds of thousands of followers across Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere with continued user interaction.  There are dozens of active different language groups about us on various social media locations.  It's a hugely active community but not in ways that traditional crypto land is used to.  Bringing a constant stream of brand new users into the crypto space is what we're going to keep doing just as a start.
Thanks again for your kind words.

No.  You hold your funds in our process as much as possible.  When you give cash, funds are loaded to you P2P, then when you transact with an exchange, the funds are settled through our network to the  exchange, which may hold your coins in a big cold wallet.  There's different levels of service, some you can't get away doing in a distributed fashion yet.  Integrating mobile minutes, bill payments, and others involve working with companies and partners efficiently.
TLDR. Decentralized is great, some processes have to be hybrid for now for certain solutions.  Fiat on ramps is one of them.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:36:07
Dude you're something else.  Good luck with your efforts.  I would ask you to stop harassing us, but falling on deaf ears.  Your trolling efforts are what's going to get you banned.

Antoine is about 6'4".  His face needed to be close to the desk to see the laptop properly.  Hence the position.  I agree, looks painful. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:00:10
No, it's like localbitcoins, with a better user experience and that you load and unload your account using cash and can hold digital cash balances.  Using our platform, you can move the funds to an exchange as one option (settlement with partners is one of the reasons the coin is used).  Once you're done trading, you can move money back to our platform and cash out.
It's a banking replacement for the cryptocurrency industry.  The era of banks closing accounts on crypto businesses is here.  We are providing another solution.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:40:01
Tons of it.  Our team is great.  Very meticulous in dealing with overwhelming demand, growth and trolling efforts. Thanks again for the continued work alt-ambassador crash neves.

I love the Lightning network.  I hope it will increase thoroughput a million fold.  Exactly what we need. Our network will use lightning on a large scale when commercially viable. We need thousands more nodes and more money in it for efficient routing. 
We run nodes for various cryptos but BTC for most of them.  No lightning ones yet, but soon.  In the meantime I applaud you fellow Bitcoin Super Soldier.  Keep running nodes.

Your statements make no sense.  Just like your concerted trolling effort.  I guess that's what comes with the state of mind you're in.  
* There was no commit.  You're talking gibberish.  The line doesn't even make sense.  All UCASH was created at beginning with an open distribution plan.  What commit?  Troll fail.
* Strangers?   Dude I'm here under my personal name not hiding behind anonymous troll accounts like you.  Doesn't matter how many you create, we will keep doing our thing.  Regardless if you're a troll trying to "make your name" in this industry with your vindictive strategy.
* Almost every coin has a pump, outside the control of the founding teams.  Because nasty pnd groups are out there targeting anything they can make money on.  Again 0 was moved by founders as previously mentioned.  But you're a troll so you go and ignore that.
We did have a good February.  A great January and December too.  It's all about the users and another great month is coming.
Bitconnect was a % returning scheme with promised money and much more.  A global ponzi and anyone intelligent enough understands the issues there.  Again you're just a troll, with lots of time on your hands though.  
Seems @_Emanuel_Neves got banned on twitter. You got the other one back for now. Thanks again for the continued opportunity to keep going and giving us motivation.  One day we may make a screenshot archive shrine to you alt-ambassador.  That day is not now though unfortunately.   For now keep helping us promote.
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:07:57
Again you must be dense.  The team to this date has moved 0 of its UCASH founder allocations or any other locked allocations at all.  This is easily verifiable with our tokens page and the ethereum blockchain for the 6 biggest wallets.  The sudden market rise is not what we expected or wanted, we were always aiming for slow and steady growth of our ecosystem. Our distribution was to a very huge new user base (300,000+ token holders) each with small amounts mostly.  This is going to lead to an interesting long term crypto economic model with tons of users on our platform and independent network decision makers.  You may not agree with our model, team, business or otherwise, but we believe in it with hundreds of thousands of brand new crypto users giving us support.  We had millions of hits on our platform with a massive influx of users in the last couple months.  Next wave is coming shortly.
Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:23:52
Welcome to come by anytime. Almost anytime.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:50:50
Seems like you're a bit dense.  It's not shilling when it's the project our team is working on.  I'm one of the founders so in non-troll talk that is called marketing.  I always talk about the business and the team and will continue to do so.  
I've been ahead since 2011, the people that know, know.  Should be retired, but chose to to work on a passion and something I see is needed in this industry.  The continued trolling just adds to the determination.  Thanks again for making us stronger.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:42:17
If you weren't such an ignorant troll, and had some brains, you would look on the way back website machine and could easily see us with products and users for a long time. MSBs have been using our software for over 2 years. But you're a hater so just ignore all that and keep spewing your garbage.  We have hundreds of thousands of users on our platform that create revenue for us daily.   That website you're punking gets more views monthly than anything you have ever built in your life.
I do have time for marketing, but I'm not the CEO.  If you weren't such a bad troll you would know that.  I'm just using every one of your troll replies on my post as an opportunity to discuss our mission more.  Thanks for that.
On another point: I've personally known you are CWJ for a while now.  I have a good network in nice places.  They send me interesting packets of information.  We know how every one of your troll accounts connects to your real accounts. We just wanted to get more data on your continued harassment of our team.  Add to that the evidence of your rampant racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ and worse posts. You're not the brightest in the bunch huh?  Thanks for all the evidence of trolling and libel.... and the opportunity to talk UCASH.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:05:21
More likely the same trolls attacking a company and its people from multiple accounts.   Social media engineering attempts are real, but fortunately can be easily used for real talk and marketing instead.  
I'm from Toronto. Not going anywhere. Been in this industry over half a decade.  Not going anywhere.  Seeya.

I'm guessing it was about bringing attention to physicial bitcoin shrines globally.

It became a top trending meme type for a couple of days of r/bitcoin history.

Ah the Twitter troll @_Emanuel_Neves and the others.   Anyone looking enough will see through your tweets and your attempts at hateful behaviour through your 2 month twitter history. Seems like your Hevel startup is just trying to get off the ground, how do you even have the time? Why act like this to a fellow Torontonian team?  Personal vendetta you said right?
Not sure what we did to you but you seem very vindictive in your efforts.  This constant harassment of our team, partners and social media accounts is just sad really.  The amount of time you put in here could be done living a healthier life.  Why go so out of your way unless there is some underlying issues you have not dealt with?  Please get help as the evidence of your hateful, sexist, racist, and worse tweets show an unfulfilled person.    
Anyways I have to thank you.  You're bringing more exposure to our innovative company and mission with your work.  It's like you're an extended alt-ambassador of our team.  People like you just make people like us work harder to achieve our goals.  What is that goal?  Bring cash to crypto conversions to local areas globally just to start.  We've been in this industry for more than 6 years, we're not going anywhere.  No matter what you say or what you do, time is on our side.  Through dedicated work our entire 50+ team members, and hundreds of thousands of users globally, we will provide a much needed distributed fiat infrastructure for the blockchain industry as a whole.  The banks are already removing exchanges and other industry businesses as clients.  What happened in China, is now happening in India.  Cash will be the only solution.  We already have tons of software updates and partnerships in the funnel that will deploy this summer.  
Thanks again for the publicity.  The real people will see through your garbage and your other troll accounts eventually.  It's not that hard to look and see.  I applaud your continued determination and efforts.  Our team will continue to deal with it as we usually do.  Keep building and growing.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:19:14
Thanks fans are always appreciated.  Our entire team loves you and the others.  If you can't make sense of my words, then I guess you should learn some english.  Your username is awful.  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:09:53
Needed quite a bit of hours of beauty sleep huh @_Emanuel_Neves.  Keep up the trolling with your 2 month old accounts. Unlike you, we have actual work to do.

Roger did some great work early in the space and helped fund a bunch of industry startups when others wouldnt.  His actions now are questionable, but we should never forget his historic efforts in bringing bitcoin to masses pre-2014.
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:28:01
You have some major troll issues.    Do some bounties, send some UCASH to another user, apply to be new converter.  Heck even go fill up your account at one of our Toronto locations or in Mumbai and then go unload again to see it work.  This in every major city is what we are working on currently.
