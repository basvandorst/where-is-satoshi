Well, coinbase warned everyone who they reported to the IRS, and provided all the info to help file the tax return. And they didn't report people who cashed out less than certain amount, as per their agreement with the IRS.
So, seems like Coinbase did their best, and warned everyone.

One interesting way is to use MakerDAO to get a trustless loan backed by crypto (so that you can spend while you HODL).
I believe, right now one can only use Ethereum as a collateral though. Not sure if it is technologically possible to do the same with BTC (if it is, would really love to hear about it)
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:57:20
Careful what you wish for. I think, in future, all the Bitcoins which came from not only dark markets, but also mixers, or were exchanged from Monero, will draw extraordinary attention to whoever got them, will get bank accounts shut down, attract FBI raids etc. That's the future where Bitcoin price is high, but \`1 BTC != 1 BTC\`.

Depends on how much money people make on it.
And one example here: a lot of drivers like to speed in Russia. And yet, I don't know any of them who paid the fine officially instead of bribing a police officer (before speeding cameras become widespread).

Russia already launched (in 2014) something called "PRO100", and 2/3 of ATMs already support it. It's a clone of visa/mastercard basically
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:18:00
More like
    1 LC = (currently_invested_principal + pending_amount) / LC_issued
Better to show an example pool of only one loan $10 which pays $1.1 in 10 installments and 10 loancoins.
* Invested $10, LC price $10/10 = $1
* Borrower paid $1.1, LC price $10.1/10 = $1.01. Here $10.1 = principal_left_to_pay + amount_pending_to_invest = $9 + $1.1 = $10.1
* $1.1 re-invested into some other loan, LC price still $10.1/10 = $1.01 (until that loan paid back)
Now, if current LC price is $1.01, and someone comes to invest in LC, he gets LC at a price $1.01, his btc go into the pool to get invested; the value of LC is not diluted. So, not really possible to pump :-)
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:26:24

There's also a network of Qiwi payment system ATMs in Russia. Many localbitcoins traders exchange btc to qiwi with a good rate.
If she has an access to a local bank account, Qiwi ATMs or Yandex Money, that could work. Then the trader doesn't have to live in Crimea. Or she can issue a Yandex Money card, get it in several days and pay with everywhere (and you sell btc for rur on btc-e, send rur to the card).

Yep, very true. I'd imagine that a conventional escrow would work when both parties put some extra money for a potential dispute mediation, plus put some hashes of all possible evidence of shipment and other personal info on blockchain.
If no mediation necessary, "mediation deposit" goes back to both. If it is, the mediator asks for the evidence, takes the money from the "guilty" party for the mediation.
On the downside, need a pool of mediators. And for *very small* transactions the "trustless scheme w/o mediators" would be better

I think, same as everywhere in Russia:
* LocalBitcoins (can recommend btcwisdom) (half spread + fee ~6%);
* Transfer your RUR to/from BTC-e through one of its trusted users (can recommend [MRaven]( and [QUERTAS]( Fee - ~3-4% out
* Transfer to/from BTC-e through Yandex-Money. The nicest way to get RUR in Russia is to make a debit card with them, fee ~0.5% now
I used these methods to send money to Russia, but it works just as well when you want to send your money out of Russia. The recipient didn't even know that Bitcoin was involved.

Great questions.


You can exchange LC into underlying loan assets which will pay off as these particular loans are repaid. This is an arbitrage opportunity for traders if the value of LC fluctuates down, and their activity will stabilize the value of LC (so that it growth is less fluctuating).
New LC is "mined" when new capital comes into the pool to increase its size. The price of this LC which you get is the same as current price of LC, so its value is not diluted.
Decentralized solution will not require trusting us. And it should work with any borrowers, not BTCJam.
Value proposition is that we put investor's money into the pool which constantly reinvests, and LC is a claim of the share of the pool. You can either sell your LC on an exchange or get underlying loan assets which will convert to btc as loans are paid off.
If you feel that risks are too high with our MVP, you can wait for a trustless solution where we don't control your money.
Ask if something is unclear!
@_date: 2014-07-13 16:01:15

In a case you didn't have many confirmations, close your bitcoin client immediately. Perhaps, a wallet surgery can help to stop sending the money once you start the wallet again.

There is a need for ifttt for Bitcoin here
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:18:45
I imagined that in a way similar to how payment microchannels are described in CLV BIP.
Actually, I think situation is this. You put money in P2SH address having a guarantee that after some time you can get these money out. It works with CLV. Then (after the fund tx is confirmed!) you can send a tx to the merchant, and your co-signer will ensure that you don't double-spend (that also works).
Now, a problem comes when you want to spend your change from previous tx with a different merchant. If that first tx is not broadcasted, second one is vulnerable.
So, it seems to me like with CLV you can immediately guarantee no double-spends *only* when previous transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. Which is fine, I suppose?

I see what you're saying. It's sort of like Counterparty where each client had to parse the blockchain and accept only what is considered Counterparty transactions. Of course, this could work only if you have full nodes, so that you're able to parse all the transactions.
In other words, full nodes are required for UASF to work (and a bit less required in no-UASF world)

What if Satoshi is a boomer?
@_date: 2019-03-02 02:06:41
Well, arguably though, one can perform a Sybil attack (spinning up gazillions of full nodes) to perform UASF. Number of full nodes is not a Sybil-resitant measure, and it should not be used for critical decisions.
Of course you are right about some extra guarantees. For instance, with SPV, a node you are connected to could chose to not tell you about certain UTXOs you have. Ideally you'd trust each full node with the probability proportional to work or stake, but full nodes don't hold anything like that.
Just had a thought though: maybe LN nodes could also serve as Sybil-resistant SPV nodes (because they hold some crypto).
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:26:12
Ok, running a full node is an endeavour.
But for simple payments, why not use SPV? Even Satoshi proposed that in the wp

Bitcoin script doesn't work for complex enough smart contracts.

As for cryptokitties \- well. Many scaling solutions come to Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum smart contracts are decentralized, they work, but they scale badly.

There are always risks. Eliminating one (the middleman) is extremely important, and exactly what all crypto stands for. There is a whole body of regulations by governments to prevent funds and banks from doing wrong things, and crypto makes those just unnecessary.

@_date: 2018-11-11 20:19:29
Ok, whatever.
On MakerDAO, you can take a loan in their stablecoin against ETH collateral. Soon it will be possible to do against ERC20 collateral.
There is a way to wrap BTC as ERC20, but not fully trustless (e.g. see Dogethereum as a demo).
Collateralization rate with ETH is 150%, with BTC I guess can certainly be no more than that: BTC is less volatile and would make a great collateral

Yes, the rally can continue. You know, the price could go up 50% more, maybe x2 during this rally, but the risk is too high. What if it doesn't?
When Bitcoin was flatting at $300, it was a rather safe bet that it will go up x5-x10, or maybe "only" x2 if everything goes badly.
Now? Yes, it can go up. But also down. We've entered dangerous waters. Quite possible that those who buy today will have to hodl for years. But of course, cryptocurrency IRA would be a rather safe bet IMO.

There are many legitimate players on LBTC. The trick is to look at ratings and use them.
I am not comfortable dealing with anyone with less than 500 trades, 100% rating. 99% is already not ok, anything suspicious in negative comments is not ok either.
LBTC can work as a middleman if something happens, but so many things still can go wrong. For example, if you receive fiat, they can trick you their bank to reverse the transaction. It also can be reversed if they use LBTC for laundering stolen credit cards. Fortunately, ratings catch that fairly soon
