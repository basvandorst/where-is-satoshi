What I meant by useless is that there is basically no chance of it affecting us in any way as of we will probably be dead. 
For the 20 years note: in my opinion it is more whether bitcoin will prove itself or whether some major will arise. But I cannot really imagine what would that be.

(PS: what I have in mind is mostly some situation when for whatever reason there would not be suddenly electricity at disposal for longer period i.e. week or so)
I have no solid info on that, but I strongly doubt, that there are paper records as of paper is not really that good for compression of datas and long-time storing.
There sure are some backup servers with self sustainable (for some time at least) electricity generators, but imagine the hoard of data. 
But sure as hell they rely on electricity and suddenly having to go back to the paper (which would be in situation when everyone would want to withdraw their money) would be catasthrophic, because they would not really be prepared for that.
Side notes:
1) I totally agree with the point that in most of the situations described above, bitcois or any other saving will be the least of our concerns.
2) Even if Bitcoin would work without problems only for another 50 years or so it still would be great way of dividing your money to not loose all in case of some trouble.
3) Debate on what will be in 100 years is IMHO completely useless as of people will come with another solutions and another completely new problems will arise.
