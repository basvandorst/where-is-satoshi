Lets see how the Japanese Government handle the MtGox bankruptcy case before celebrating here. The result of this should be known on or before Feb 28th this year.
Right now they want to give 97% of all the remaining funds to the owner who fucked it all up in the first place. If this happens then this does not look very good for Japans future in the crypto industry.

DigitalCoin (DGC) had a planned fork last week to DGC version 3.
It now allows up to 1024 bytes to be stored in an op_return transaction when the appropriate fee is paid.
So this is quite feasible and already possible.
Accessing the stored data via API's will be very easy in the coming weeks and months as more front end work is done.
This is one of the things I considered prior to suggesting we increase the data storage size.
The fact that it can be done is quite irrelevant, there are easily accessible decentralised databases now and there always will be. Encrypting some command and storing it somewhere for later retreival will always be easy from now on.
There's far more uses for the greater good with decentralised blockchain storage than there are for the bad. Also : existing laws cover the bad guys actions so it's a law enforcement problem.
It's always been easy like some others mentioned commands in twitter, etc.

@_date: 2014-08-02 23:33:17
I believe blockchain style ledger technology will be useful in systems like this.
Double spends and other attempted chicanery could be eliminated by using a p2p KSI (keyless signature infrastructure) distributed timestamping system which not only accepts a digest to provide a simple timstamp for something like a PDF file but it could also easily be made to directly accept asset transfer transactions and provide the only accepted way to process a transaction for entry into a fully segregated asset chain which would be fully under the control of the asset issuer. This would provide a way to detect double spends of outputs based on the timestamps of the transactions and have them all rejected, including the original which was subsequently double spent during the confirmation time period. Confirmation time is an arbitary amount of time like 60 seconds, 10 seconds or even 1 second, etc.
P2P distributed KSI timestamping systems have a lot to offer.
I'm working towards something like this at the moment, I have many thoughts and ideas on this kind of system. I want to remove transaction 'processing and confirmation' from the hands of miners. There's no need for mining with advanced distributed timestamping systems which can't be faked or modified in any way if done correctly.
Mining is a good way to distribute new coins which are minted. Issued assets don't need it. The requirements for this kind of system are very different from Coin systems which at the time needed to provide everything in a single package as nothing was proven at the time.
Things are different now.
Watch out for timestamping development discussion forums popping up in the coming weeks.

It's not gox manipulating - there's a bunch of people going around spreading FUD and buying up peoples Bitcoins in Gox accounts using the account to account transfer function which is still working. They do this at a massive discount to take full advantage of any fear.
These guys have been going around the IRC rooms making their derisory offers to all. Some of them are obvious early adopters and well known in the Bitcoin community.
The price has been manipulated down with multiple large sells of 1000 BTC, 2500 BTC and 5000 BTC. The 5000 sell on February 14th at around 10:00 am reduced the price by nearly 30%. This was followed by many more huge sells which only seved to further reduce the price - one of them took it down 10%. This kind of trade is annoying if you're daytrading.
This is 100% manipulative and the only goal is to get more coins.
Personally I bought some coins on the way down and now I'm holding them no matter what happens.

A competent person will keep a copy of their important data with multiple backups in different places and likely encrypted.
Having examined how Bitcoin works I can confirm that whoever created it knows what they are doing and is likely pretty competent so I doubt any keys have been lost at all.

Travelling half way around the world is not something that most people like doing at the best of times, it's very tedious.
I live in Asia and was offered a free trip to Barcelona last year by a guy I do some work for, 12 hour flights each way, days of heavy drinking in between.
I couldn't be bothered so I didn't go. Flying around the world is a real pain in the ass and best avoided if possible.

I think they sell this on buzzwords alone.
It can 'scale' - it sure can but if you buy a $5k web server that should be more than you need unless you need some serious firepower.
In my opinion AWS is for small companies who can't afford big multi server hardware investments or for huge companies who get large discounts - for them it might even work out cheaper than buying cabinets full of hardware and gigabits of 95% contracted bandwidth.

You don't need to write your own cryptography, in fact it's very much recommended that only career cryptographers implement actual cryptographic primitives - google 'rolling your own crypto'. So there's no need to get into the math behind the algorithms - it's simply not needed to use them, sure it's useful if you want to understand what's going on behind the scenes but not needed to use them.
All you need to do is write programs that use the required cryptographic primitives.
For Bitcoin these primitives are the SHA256 and the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithms along with the ECDSA signature algorithm using the secp256k1 curve.
That's about it really. The blockchain itself is not encrypted in any way, it's just a bunch of signatures chained together by hashes and tree structures of hashes.
That's grossly simplifying it but there's nothing new in Bitcoin, it uses pre existing things in a new way.

Forward thinking my ass.
The MtGox bankruptcy which is proceeding right now will show them up as backward thinking morons.
They recently confirmed that their plan is to pay people who had Bitcoin in their accounts at the time when it went bust only $480 per coin even though they still have 202,000 Bitcoin and haven't sold a single one of them.
They also plan on selling them all, and soon.
The rest of the money will go to Mark Karpeles, the guy who fucked it all up at MtGox.
The plan by the genius in charge is to give Mark Karpeles nearly $1 Billion and everyone else virtually nothing because Bitcoin was worth $480 on the day it went bankrupt - they don't care about the rest of the money.

There is no confusion. Civil Rehabilitation was not rejected by a court appointed examiner at the end of the last month. At this stage in the process it was denied by the court back in 2014 so this time around there is a lot more progress.
We do meet the requirements for civil rehabilitation to commence with various conditions which are not yet clear. It's now been passed back to the judge in charge of the bankruptcy.
If we meet those conditions which I am sure we can then we will proceed to Civil Rehabilitation.

We've been following this case in great detail since about last August.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:13:40
If we enter Civil Rehabilitation which we almost certainly will then we will get the coins. If that means selling them all then so be it.

What he's saying is that he didn't dump them on the open market like an idiot - this is what people have been accusing him of doing. 
He makes it very clear that this is not what happened.
What happens after he's sold them is nothing to do with him, it's not his responsibility.
If I sold you 38k Bitcoin why would I give a crap what you do with them after you've bought them - they now belong to you and as such it's up to you what you do with them ?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:35:16
Maybe not, we should know within the next 2 months if this approved by the judge.
The only way it won't be approved is if the judge acts against the advice of the court appointed examiner which seems unlikely as the judge himself appointed the examiner.
Assuming Civil Rehabilitation is approved as per the plan then it should be possible to make a new claim under Civil Rehabilitation, the law appears to allow it but this is subject to the judges restrictions so the answer for now would have to be : possibly.

I bought my first Bitcoin for $13

Good on you for speaking out. I suggest you do whatever you want and don't allow the other board members to influence your actions. They're clearly a broken organisation.
What kind of subtle threats are you talking about ?
You were elected, being asked to leave by a few others isn't on. That would surely annoy all the members who voted.
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:03:26
Excellent news, glad it all worked out for you !
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:14:38
Fuck paypal

Fuck that cunt !

Never say the word Bitcoin to your bank, they will most likely add you to some kind of 'high risk' list and your life will never be the same again.
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:15:18
Quite possibly
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:14:13
Did you have any 2 factor authentication enabled ?
@_date: 2015-04-23 11:24:02
Perhaps Google should just buy their own bank.
@_date: 2015-04-17 22:31:41
How will they get the two way peg into Bitcoin for side chains to work ?
This will require a Bitcoin protocol change which I suspect might be a long time in coming.
It could be years away, if ever.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:52:06
Why should we be watching it ?
If someone can't sell 16,443 Bitcoin without tanking the market then there is no market.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:25:07
He sold them to Bitcoinbuilder didn't he ?
Then after doing this based on what I've read he also attempted to claim them during the bankruptcy process even though he'd previously sold them, he's been called out on this on reddit. Some searching will tell you all you need to know.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:51:41
Sure it is, he's covered all of the MtGox liabiliaties so there is no legal reason to sell any more but whatever you think dude.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:29:54
I have no idea what you're talking about but good luck with your future as a professional asshole.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:20:59
What happens next is up to the court, Mark is a spectator like the rest of us at this stage.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:36:28
First time since March which was 12 short days ago.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:06:07
Of course not. To reverse that transaction once it's propogated the network would require an extraordinary amount of work for a couple of dollars and even if you managed to mine the next block with a replacement transaction going to a different address which invalidates the original transaction you would need to subvert the entire system just for one piece of cake.
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:48:43
If he's selling this amount it will be to an OTC buyer, an off market private transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:56:23
You're still an asshole
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:26:27
No they didn't. Kraken didn't say that there was a market order, they advised against that and the trustee confirmed that he did not sell on the open market. He just didn't use Kraken to make his sales.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:52:55
This is a very old joke, I heard it 30 years ago when I was a kid.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:12:47
There is no awareness of any authorisation to sell anything.
That's something you just made up. 16k coins moved, nothing more.
Stretching that into some kind of fictional order to sell every coin is just that...a bit of a stretch.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:36:39
Mostly because it doesn't actually exist in anything other than a paper form.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:48:37
No, they didn't
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:57:33
There's a list of addresses and their balances / what's moved here : 
Note - none had moved when he started this page.

This is the basis of stream ciphers, xor it once and it's encrypted, xor it twice and it's decrypted. Simple stuff which you learn about age 15 and I'm in my mid 40's - I learned it when I was 15.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:43:11
So very corrupt
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:01:03
Proof + time is the key. Any court case would be months if not years in the future.
You seem to be saying that you could change a block containing a proof of existence from lets say 6 to 12 months ago with this 51% attack.
I think we all know that's simply not possible and will never happen.

They have cash sniffing dogs on patrol on public transport these days.

With this new information now out in the open are you obliged to stay silent or can you speak freely about your experiences with the US Government ?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:14:22
Yes, I learned that one the hard way !
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:20:33
Well I still use an old version, a really old version. It gets magnet links and that's all I need
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:37:44
Get a bunch of these, throw them all over the surface, take a photo of it then run the photo through sha256.
No need to type them in one by one.
Where can I buy them ?
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:59:55
They might not extradite but they will boot your ass out of nearly all of them the moment your passport expires or some friendly government asks them to.
The US Government can make a passport expire whenever they want.
One example being the piratebay guy who was sent back from Cambodia which is on the list.
They don't need to go through the extradition - they just throw you out by revoking your visa.
In my experience some of the third world countries have the most stringent visa regulations of them all.

A single key does not a wallet make !

Price has gone up today.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:24:46
Trade, take it out, etc didn't work out too well for me when I sold coins and then rebought just days before the Gox collapse.
They stayed on my computer 99% of the time.
@_date: 2015-03-29 10:24:47
Seems a little wrong to me. Someone should come up with a clever way to make them pay for their wrongdoing.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:26:37
Yes, sure was.

If you get arrested you will sit in a cell for a day, maybe two then they let you go unless you're a danger in which case its off to remand prison for you.
White collar crime like this = instant bail.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:09:27
Yeah, back then I used 2 exchanges : MtGox and BTC-e
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:51:00
BTCe are not a Russian company are they ?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:28:06
Sure it is. It's not legal according to 'SEC' but they operate only in the US, whereas the vast majority of the people in the world are outside the US and don't give a shit about US regulations.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:28:40
Any update on this ?
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:25:58
If they steal the money they will get arrested just like the other exchange operator who got arrested, this will act as a deterrent to others. You should never keep too much money on an exchange - it's just common sense. Any exchange could go bankrupt / get shutdown for one reason or another at any time.

Nothing's novel, it's just a new use for an existing system : Digital Signing.
The future may well lie in ed25519, that's what I'll be using.

I really can't see poor Africans queueing up to buy Bitcoins at highly inflated prices from wealthy Americans who purchased them years ago for next to nothing. Maybe I'm wrong.

bitpay.com will do this for you. Lots of people are already using it for porn.

Be sure to check out the Khan academy videos, there's some useful information in there.
One thing worth bearing in mind is that there are two separate parts to Bitcoin as far as I'm concerned.
1 - The client and p2p network, transactions and the ledger (blockchain).
2 - Mining and 'transaction confirmation' by including transactions in blocks.
These things are very separate but compliment each other in a way that at this time is required.

A lot of people think CloudFlare is an NSA operation.
@_date: 2013-10-12 12:34:54
A good way to test if it's a compromised wallet would be to send some more Bitcoin (small amount) to the same address and see if it gets sweeped up again.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:30:33
Is he really an expert in Cryptography ?
He wrote a program that uses Cryptography which was created long before Bitcoin.

The dirtiest of all the Bitcoins are the Silk Road coins in the hands of the FBI.
I want to make sure I NEVER accept any of these government seized coins.
Can't someone blacklist them in some way ?
