Have you heard of REQ network? It doesn't fully solve the issue, but at least it removes the need for the reversal in a majority of the cases (e.g. where you wrote the wrong address down).

Idea about gift cards it's awesome. Have to check if there are any Tesco/Sainsbury/Some other grocery store shops... Do you have any idea where to buy

It would be great if we could hear some lawyer from EU on this matter.

I didn't said anything is wrong with shipping, but I'm just not willing to pay that much for it.

If you are not looking percentages, it is.

Does it matter? I will do this for free in my spare time and will probably open source it. If you asked for any other reason please send me a PM.

It seems that mtgox is under ddos and everything else is suffering from that.
Yes please stop using mtgox. Use other exchanges on daily basis.

At least default option should be something else. Its better if we spread load across different exchanges than all on one. It doesn't solve the problem but it helps.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:50
True, I'm thinking to invest something into DDOS and do this madness by myself.

You described my situation exactly EXACTLY every price everything.

The moment you realize its not anymore.

Did  you ever thought of using cloudflare? Or maybe host your site in cloud instead of dedicated servers?
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:01:30
It's nice but please stop using mtgox. Use bitstamp instead.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:07:34
I feel bad now
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:00:17
I did a similar thing for my-self. You have encouraged me to polish it and show it here so others can use it. Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-20 09:00:12
Do you even know what you just said?
Edit for everyone: We are talking about quantom computing here not standard ASIC miners.

I did to cousin, he'll probably draw something. :)

 No just no, only bitcoin is ok. Use something like RES to block images.
 not sure about it
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:02:35
Please no. No mtgox
