A global shared policy constitutes a government of sorts.  Perhaps not in the strict traditional sense, but it amounts to the same benefits and burdens.

So... a couple of things.
Firstly, because wtf - seriously, Native Americans were forced onto reservations at gunpoint after having their lands and property stolen by armies of invading colonists.  I have no idea what you're hoping to imply with that reference.
Secondly, English isn't a global language, even if it is a particularly common language.  [Mandarian Chinese and Spanish speakers outnumber English speakers]( so if you're looking for a "global policy" and you're choosen English, then you may have made a miscalculation.
Thirdly, languages *do* consist of certain grammatical policies which impact people on a host of levels - legally, socially, ideologically, etc.  These policies are not rigidly enforced, but you'd be a damn fool to believe you can compose a contract without a clear conception of what words or phrases mean.  Or that certain dialects and speech patterns aren't rewarded/punished socially depending on your regional venue.
So language definitely constitutes a policy.  And that policy undergoes enforcement on a number of levels, typically by people who maintain large amounts of wealth or inhabit bureaucratic positions of authority.  If you had a "one world language", this would inevitably create a set of linguistic circumstances that amount to a "one world law" or "government".

Given the context of the discussion - Metcalf's Law - being at the center of Krugman's comment, it's kind of important to recognize what he was talking about.  No one ever seems to want to mention the earlier part of the commentary.
Ignore it and you run afoul of argumentation from idiocy, wherein you cite Krugman saying "The sky is blue" purely for the sake of interjecting "NOT AT NIGHT, STUPID!"  But if your goal is merely a game of "Gotcha!", rather than to have a casual discussion of economics, then I guess I can see why you'd want to adhere to the strictest reading of Krugman's words possible.
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:31:06
I've already spelled out the context.  But please, keep denying.  I'm sure you're getting all sorts of internet points.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:55:30
Nah.  Just another data point backing up P. T. Barnum's "Sucker born every minute" hypothesis.

Is your working claim that - per Metcalfe's Law - a network link between individuals A and B in a set consisting of A and B will carry the same weight as a network link between A and B in a set consisting of 17576 elements AAA thru ZZZ?
The bottom line is that connectivity between individuals who have no information to convey is valueless.  He's not wrong in that regard.  A telephone is only as valuable as the numbers in it you intend to actually call.  The value is in the connectivity, not in the addition of superfluous actors.  What you are doing, in asserting Krugman's wrongness, isn't bolstering the value of the internet.  You're undervaluing the fax machine (or simply the telephone).


The fax machine was a massively significant economic actor, and point-to-point electronic communication (the model that the fax machine is built on) continues to be a vital component of commerce.  Instant messaging and email is, in many ways, the grandchild of faxing services.  And I easily make use of them as much as I make use of general internet connectivity.
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:06:54


It's central, as it's the topic of discussion.  The statement is predicated on the notion that mass media interactive communication (the internet) will wholly replace point-to-point communication (faxes, phone calls, instant messenger).  Such a transition never occurred.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:52:47
It's a well-known fact that if the price of something goes up, and I don't own it, then ponzi scheme.  Prices don't normally rise, see?  Unless, that is, I'm making one of my traditionally savvy investments.  Or there's a scam running.  I'm either a winner or a victim.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:25:53


The fax machine as a tool provided rapid point-to-point transmission of non-digital media.  We have a number of modern tools that have replaced the fax machine in practice, but continue to serve the same purpose.  And that purpose - providing point-to-point communication of non-digital media - remains as vital today as the purpose of the internet - which is to provide on-demand access to mass media.


It has a central bearing, as it demonstrates the utility of the fax machine equivalents (which would presumably benefit from Metcalf's Law in proportion to internet access) are no less than that of internet access tools.
The question at hand is whether Metcalf's Law is completely sound.  Krugman refutes it by noting that simply adding more nodes to the pool doesn't provide additional utility to all existing nodes.  This is the core concept he's challenging, and one that the Krug-haters blindly ignore in seeking to score cheap rhetorical points.
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:23:30


You can keep repeating yourself if you like.  As the Krugman quote has been repeated ad nauseum, stripped of all context, I'm not surprised to see this tactic used as a last resort.

Which brings us to the third point.  If you plan on compiling scientific data or conducting business in English, it's rather important that all parties have an agreed-upon understanding of the language.  Such agreement forms a policy.  And whomever carries the weight in establishing/enforcing said policy is a de facto government administrator, as the administration of the language constitutes a form of adjudication of business dealings.

"I do not understand a thing, and therefore it does not exist" tends to be the pro-Santa logic.  
There's also a strange cognitive dissonance here, in which democracy is terrible because we can't have two sheep and a wolf voting on a vegan mandate.  But democracy is a farce and you are stupid if you believe it exists.  Is the horror of majority rule a problem, or isn't it?

"Sky is blue."

There are plenty of people that will argue that gambling is, at its heart, an institution built on fraud.  You promise positive returns.  You deliver negative returns.  Then you call your clients stupid for believing your original claims.
Ultimately, there's this bizarre assumption that running a scam isn't a form of theft, because the suckers who bite do so voluntarily.  People will actively defend con-artistry using some weird, twisted permutation on a traditional ethical code of non-violence.

Lulwhut?  It's almost like you didn't actually read the article or respond to the points, and instead tried to turn an economic question into a contest of "Who has the biggest cock?"
Krugman was - like it or not - correct.  The ability to telecommunicate is inherent in both fax machines and internet connections.  Telecommunication is what benefits business, not the flavor of the connection.
Rather than tackling Metcalfe's law (the actual economic question being discussed) we get a snippet of a snippet and a bunch of Econ 101'ers "Herp De Derp"ing with nonsense responses like this one above.

Ah, but you misunderstand.  Every day is one day closer to the end of the world.  It's nihilism taken to the logical conclusion.  Embrace the end of all things, because at least then we'll be rid of municipal governance.

Yeah, but they're not entering the market for sale.  New coins come from trading USD for electricity.  The price of the coins themselves isn't realized until you exchange USD for BTC.  If volume of sales was going up 44k/day, then you might have a point.  But if the new coins aren't changing hands, this statistic isn't terribly relevant.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:55:24
When the ISPs start accepting bitcoins, then it won't be an issue!  Haha!
Seriously, though, there is actually another sub dedicated to this eventuality.  
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:47:48
Amazon already has a system like that.  
That said, you're right.  If there was a "BitMarket" as big as Amazon or Ebay, I suspect we wouldn't see the same kind of fluctuations.  Silk Road *was* an up-and-coming market of that size, before it got busted up.
But then that's a flaw in BTC's reputation.  It's been tainted by the "I can use this to evade taxes / buy and sell illegal goods / embezzle money!" anti-government contingent.  Markets that are geared towards illicit goods and activities will be harassed in the same way that torrent sites are harassed.  You can't ever get big if you're under constant siege from third party governments and hostile businesses.

Might want to consult the definition there, broseph.  "Fundamental" or "Intrinsic" value is tied to an asset's income-generating capacity.
BitCoins aren't capital goods.  They're commodities.  They don't produce value.
