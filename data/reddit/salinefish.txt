Lets all hope localbitcoins hires more customer support. Users from most threads have been complaining for far too long (that includes me) and far too much for it to go unnoticed. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:14:52
I couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:55:33
Well that sounds unfortunate. Has support gotten back to you regarding this? It's already been 12 hours

Paxful has better reviews compare to others. I've experimented with most platforms but these days I use paxful more often due to convenience.

I hope this gets to the admins at lbc

People either think bitcoin is a scam or simply don’t give a fuck. Lots of people would change their minds if they bothered to look it up.

I use paxful and often recommend this platform to beginners due to the amount of paxful tutorials and guides available that can really help a first-timer.

This video convinced my sister that bitcoin isn't a scam after all.

Localbitcoins couldn't care less about the security of their users and lets fraudsters run the place. Giving them access to thousands of IDs and selling it to the feds. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:54:37
As expected. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 08:24:10
Read that too. I think that's a bad excuse for providing poor support.

It's not a mainstream platform, not a lot of people trust it.

Is replying to month-old disputes too much to ask

I heard trade transactions in Bisq is slow and isn't good for active traders

Some countries in Asia are already passing crypto-related laws.

Paxful and LocalBitcoins are one of the most established platforms in the current market today, my general advice is to stick to what most people have been using and avoid new exchanges in the meantime.

The demand is only getting better because various businesses (big or small) across the globe are slowly adapting bitcoins and peer to peer trading is one of the easiest ways access bitcoin, all it takes is just an internet connection. Even poor farmers in third world countries have access to smartphones and the internet.

You could call Bitcoin a double-edged sword.

Am I the only one who's not surprised by this? Africa is a fertile ground for crypto companies. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:03:56
Yeah no surprise. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:55:08
I notice people from African countries use Paxful more.
