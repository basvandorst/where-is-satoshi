We've been devaluing the dollar for 100 years basically every monetary policy thats been enacted. I dont think join is the proper word.

tokyo opened light volume, generally nothing to get excited about. London opens 2 am CST medium volume, US open morning that's when the volume hits.

The only alt I've seen lately that is not correlated is IOTA. That does not mean it can not change though. As far as cryto's being a bubble If AAPL drops 40 points that equal to all of bitcoin...it's no where near a bubble.

just a guess. there is zero interest in the product. If you look at the volume it's almost non-existent. No volume = no liquidity. No liquidity = a shitty product to trade. It's also to big of a product for most traders, 1 contract is 5 bitcoin.

Every monetary policy since the feds inception has seen the "note" debased. Then in 71 nixon removed what little intrinsic value was left and  walla.

99% of people would not know what they are talking about then. Fiat is not a store of value when its purchasing power continues to shrink to the point of being worthless.

With a little tweaking vega's run a 60-68C full load, hardly shit cooling. Noise on the other hand is a different story.
