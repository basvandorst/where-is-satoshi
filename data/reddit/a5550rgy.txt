I like it when the Bitcoin Boi's try to convince everyone this is not like any other currency therefore classical theories don't apply. Then they tell everyone to just buy and hodl..A classical rational that's used to manage a balanced portfolio (not individual stocks) that follows the market trends.....not Crapto Currency

Stop using all of the infrastructure that taxes provide you and maybe they will stop.

The other big math error I see when dealing with percentages is thinking that you "only" need a 50% gain to offset a 50% loss. That logic will keep in you the poor house no matter the investment.

Those damned greedy banks with their FDIC insurance (US), easy to setup and use accounts, and willingness to loan out money. Banks are not shaking, they are laughing at these sort of idealistic approaches toward a currency. The smart money has always treated crypto as a way to profit off of irrational ideology; not as an investment in the currency of the future. When the shoe shine boy is investing, it's time to get out :).

Hahahahaha....this is hilarious. BTC can't even get it's own house in order. It's as if BTC is a utopia of altruistic players. If BTC truly provides value to humanity, it will succeed. Forcing your skewed and desperate BTC ideology on people in will never work.
