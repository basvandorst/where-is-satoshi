Back down to &lt;$13,000.  Time to buy some more?

Wow have you people in the states been allowed to treat crypto to crypto as a non-taxable event up until now?
Some other countries including the one I live in have always treated every crypto to crypto transaction as a taxable event :(  I wanted to treat it as like-for-like but got told I wasn't allowed to do that :/

Yeah it is super slow for me as well.  I was hoping their new engine was going to make it as fast as Bitfinex or Binance or something.  But as long as you get your deposit soon, you only need to put up with it for one trade to get some crypto and then withdraw it straight out to another exchange that actually works.
Edit: Just saw your other message that you finally got your deposit.  That's awesome!!  Have fun.  I only just started mine... hopefully these prices might still be available in 2 weeks time.

Oh cool thank you for letting me know.  At least now I know it's still safe to transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:26:22
None of the exchanges I'm on halted trading O.o  I didn't think it was for real when someone posted here that Coinbase had done so.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:57:09
Yeah I was aware of that and I know the CBOE &amp; CME Bitcoin futures also halt if the price changes enough during a days trading.  But I didn't realize that extended to crypto trading as well.  I was always under the assumption that crypto exchanges traded 24/7 unless the servers crashed or they went down for maintenance.  It was quite eye opening to realize that crypto exchanges might halt trading as well.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:27:49
I thought that was only for withdrawals?  Surely if you're just trading on the exchange it shouldn't matter whether your coins are in a hot or cold wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:36
Back down to $13,000 again :P  Hope you managed to get some at &lt;$11k as well if you still had cash sitting around in your account.
Unfortunately I wasn't in front of my screen when everything started crashing so I didn't get a chance to sell out high and buy back low.
I have deposited some more money though because I do believe it will go up again.  Just by the week or two it takes to reach my account I may miss out on these prices.  Will have to wait and see what happens now.

Ahh that makes more sense now and thank you for the further explanation.  Up until recently I'd done all my transfers through Ethereum so I'm still learning the in's and out's of how Bitcoin transfers work.

Wow.  Sorry to see you're so angry.
I just wanted to add that you did do something to earn those gains you got.  You became aware of an opportunity and decided to put real money into it, hoping that it would eventually come good.  There are so many other people who heard about this before and didn't do anything... either because they were too afraid to invest or because they would rather spend their money on other things.  You took a risk and it sounds like it paid off for you.  Making that decision took courage, it meant being willing to take a risk and it required you to actually take action and not just think about doing it (like so many other people do and then after all that talking they end up doing nothing).  In my opinion, that means you have earned these gains you have gotten.  Fortune favors the Bold ;)
Also, I wouldn't recommend lumping all rich people into the "insufferable assholes" basket.  If you meet enough of them, you'll find they're much the same as normal people.  If they don't have a big ego, they can be very nice.  If they do have a big ego, not so nice.  It's the same thing in a gym.  There are some super fit guys there who don't have big egos and are wonderful people to hang out with.  Then you have other super fit guys who think they rule the world just because their muscles are popping out of their clothes and so get all arrogant, cocky, spend all their time telling you how great they are and how much they benched 5 mins ago, etc.  Rich people are much the same.  The trick is to ignore the ones with the big egos and talk to the humble ones instead.
And try to not worry so much about what people think of you when they look at you.  There could of been 100 different reasons why he looked at you the way he did.  You're just making an assumption that was the reason for his look because of what you were thinking about at the time.  Maybe your assumption is correct or maybe it's not.  Either way, you will probably never know, so see if you can try not to get so upset by something that might not even be true.
Lastly, you mentioned you like reading self improvement books.  That's really cool.  If you haven't already, you may enjoy Letting Go by David Hawkins.  It's all about how most of us get emotional and then hold onto those negative emotions (sadness, anger, etc.) and how that causes us to suffer.  It then goes into detail on how to let go of negative emotions instead of holding onto them.  It takes practice yet if you can grasp what his saying and practice it until it becomes automatic, you will find it will help you let go when you get really emotional and return to a calm state much quicker.

Noob question: If I sent a Bitcoin transaction with a very high fee, will it still go through quickly or will all those unconfirmed transactions slow everything down including the higher fee ones?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:03:03
Yeah that's true.  Apparently several of the other big names are also doing the same thing.  I'm very interested to see how that's going to work with the other cryptos.  Many of them are much, much less liquid than Bitcoin.  With their spending power compared to what's currently spent each day on the smaller ones, they will easily be able to move a lot of them wherever they want to.  Should be an interesting couple of months ahead.

Haha I now wish I had deposited some more money when you did as I'm probably going to have the same issue as you.  Except if I go deposit some more now, the prices will probably have gone back up by the time it ends up in my account in a week or two.  Hopefully your deposit gets credited asap so you can buy while everything is still on sale.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:48:35
Oh fair enough.  I didn't know that because so far I've been lucky enough to not have experienced that.

They're setting up a crypto trading desk:
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:19
That's a great idea for exchange to exchange transfers.  I was just hoping to withdraw some BTC to a private wallet though so will need to withdraw as BTC this time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:52:56
Haha I agree with your last statement.  I've been doing a bit of trading as well.  Some of it has gone well and was worth it.  Then other times, even if I'm up, I later realized I would have made a whole lot more if I had just held onto it from the start instead of constantly buying/selling it back and forth.  Especially some of the alts that went up 200-300% or more and I thought I was doing good because I traded them here and there for 10% or 20%.  If I had just held them instead I would probably have double or maybe triple what I do now.  Been a good learning experience though.
