So who pays the fees then? There has to be some form of fee, even if it is someones time. Could someone explain this and even how LN will not have fees.

You love losing money?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:16:22
This is what I image most buyers in the sub are like. Everyone just says HODL as the price tanks another thousand, like its some joke, while some whales are getting rich and we are losing. Its seems people are denying the fact that we are under 10K now when we were almost at 20K and people are just hoping Bitcoin rebounds or they'll lose their money. That's all it is - just my opinion.

I think you need to stop calling every dip a correction. The price has been falling since Christmas and people have a right to do what they please with their investment. I am personally keeping my coins, but come on this is clearly not a correction, some whales have sold and something needs done with the speed of transactions and fees or realistically Bitcoin will never be a viable currency. Coinbase also isn’t helping by dicking around with implementing segwit. There’s a lot to work out and of course if people start losing their money they will bail. Most people are in bitcoin to make money and not for the technology even though they act like it.

Cool test but give options for the month/years questions. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:58:08
This helps by making the community be not taken seriously. The only answers you guys have for anything bitcoin related is HODL. It’s getting corny. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:56:38
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:01:41
Coinbase doesn’t care. Quit wasting your time. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:30:47
Thank you for a logical answer. I come to Reddit in search of good insight, but all it is is a bunch of kids saying "To the moon!, HODL, this is FUD" and making memes claiming they'll NEVER sell. I wonder WTF are they going to do? Just keep pumping money in for the cause? Everyone is looking to gain something financially out of Bitcoin, so why don't they start acting like there could be some issue with it. Just my two cents...
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:47:47
It’s okay to be excited, but we still need to make sure this subreddit is taken seriously. Every time we pass another thousand there can’t excessive celebrating. How about at 20k we throw a party? Now that’s a goal.

I made the mistake of telling my wife and now she wants to take "our" money out and go on vacation. Can someone please have a talk with her?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:04:34
Was saying that every 1k increase we don’t have to make stupid memes. OP has been a member of Reddit for a short period of time, probably doesn’t even own close to 1 coin and now he/she tries to get all physiological with these stupid posts. Yes. It is stupid. Still. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:13:44
So you have no idea how to actually spot a correction? You just keep spewing bullshit which doesn’t help the newbs and that’s why they spread the FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:05:38
These every thousand marks are getting a little annoying. Everyone who has bitcoin checks the price hourly, so we don't need these posts by redditors for one week. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:15:25
Can someone please explain to me what the hell this even means? I've seen the Matrix but this is just stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:04
Redditor for 5 weeks? This is the shit why the bitcoin community won’t be taken seriously. Come on!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:00:18
This subreddit is also filled with “redditor for three month” titles who act like know it alls and spread FUD. It is an exciting time and it’s good to make money and sucks to lose it, but we all signed up for the ride and the exponential growth over the past year was also filled with dips - not crashes.

My PayPal is free to transfer (takes 1 day) and if I want an instant payment its 1%. Where is the $6.99 coming from?

The reason the price drops so quickly is because whales have figured out how the game works. They buy in and inflate the price, make some profits, and then cash out. This leaves the smaller guy (us) with losses forcing us to HOLD onto our coins and salvage what we have left. This is just my opinion, but they don't care about the technology, they care about profits and they are the ones making them, while we are posting roller-coaster memes and other stupid shit in this subreddit. Bitcoin is so volatile that it allows these whales to use it to make a quick buck because they can pump and dump. Once the big "investors" joined the game it was over for us. Futures, EFTs, short/long trades, and allowing the SEC to have a say was not in the foundation of Bitcoin. It was a risk and it backfired. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:26:52
Basically, OP is going to blow his friends minds with his expertise on Bitcoin. So, with his vast knowledge on the subject he must explain it thoroughly to each individual. Everything from the blockchain, where to buy, never sell (HODL), mining, hashrates, and the halving that's coming in 2020. So these guys better buckle up, they are in for a wild ride!
Edit - sorry I am just assuming you're a male
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:56:30
Of course not, but most people don't follow the golden rule - don't invest more than you are willing to lose. That also leads to a lot of panic sells, but my main point was that I was trying to find a root cause to the ups and downs. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:58:18
Most people don’t know what they need. They need the price to increase to protect their investment. So I guess postings memes is their only way to justify what they think they want. EFTs is the last thing bitcoin needs because it creates a manipulative market, pumps the prices, and those investors will dump their coin for profit. That’s not what bitcoin needs.

Sometimes people need to be told exactly how things are and if someone disagrees with someone else's views then they are attacked. You guys in this forum are truly pathetic, you will make any excuse to make yourself feel better about anything - in this case its losing money. Everything is lambo, FUD, its only a correction, we're in it for the technology, to the moon, bear/bull market, its all bullshit. 
I do agree with you that I can be a shitty person. Reddit has made me very cynical because people like you. You go searching for a reason to feel superior towards others. People who take an internet forum so seriously need better things to do. 
In addition, I know you probably hate Trump and are a democrat, you probably feel your rights are infringed upon just by waking up in the morning. I get it, its all over Reddit. There are lots of people like this and I just have a field day with my imaginary internet friends.
Word of advise - lighten up dude. Have a good Friday
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:02:57
Wait, so it’s about $ now and not the technology? These posts confuse me...
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:13:41
I should have phrased it “one of the root causes.”  I certainly do hope I’m wrong, I’m just speculating, but there are only so many facts it’s hard to tell. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:31:38
If someone takes an opinion as “information” and then is misinformed from that opinion, then they are the idiot. 
You think “we’ll” dip below 6k tonight? :(
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:51:19
Either way I phrased my comment doesn’t call for me to edit anything because I’m not trying to spread information, I gave an opinion. You can continue to have your views and confirmation bias because you really want that lambo and I will have mine. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:35:55
I'm very surprised by the comments here siding with the parents. I do agree you should respect your parents wishes, especially if you are living in their house and they support you, but what really surprises me is that everyone in this sub hasn't told you to buy anyways because Bitcoin needs the help! And most importantly, HODL!
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:34:04
Don’t worry, they’ll be back for some more of your money. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:26:01
Redditor for 3 months - perfect person to take advise from, which is probably just HODL. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:28:30
In it for the technology huh?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:35
Thank for the great response! I was just curious if there were any end of the year taxes that had to be paid on profits and if Coinbase/Gemini merchants distributed them to everyone. Stuff like that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:16:05
I always thought we had to pay capital gains tax anyways? Can someone explain?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:29
This has happened to me with my last 2 buys. Its very frustrating, but its also fun to watch the price go up again!
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:49:27
This guy is definitely in it for the technology
