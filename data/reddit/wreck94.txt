That's above the current average fee, it sucks that it's taken that long... I sent a somewhat similar transaction (in size) about two days ago with a fee about half of yours (in BTC/byte), all things considered it took about 6 hours.
It's all a guess from here, man, sorry about that shitty luck! Although, the other couple people who have already commented are pretty much spot on, most likely it'll be done within the next half a day, and then if you're really unlucky, it might take a couple days.

Sounds like your hangup here is on civil forfeiture rather than on this bill specifically. The cops can already take all your cash/etc if you're suspected of a crime.
This bill might not be great, but it still doesn't sound anything like a 'ban' on Bitcoin, but just the government saying, "Hey, you know how we can take your cash when we want to? Just by saying you're a terrorist or buying drugs or something? Yeah, we're taking your cash, and now we can take your Bitcoin too, you terrorist."

Yeah, it was all CPU
But I don't think he's lying, 7 years ago is a very long time to keep an essentially non important part of a memory around

It can, but it won't be very profitable. The Pi doesn't really have that much processing power, and the potential benefits from mining on it are almost certainly overshadowed by the costs of electricity/other expenses.

You will have them in both forks. One side of the fork will become like an alternate reality and eventually people will stop supporting that side.
It's neither good nor bad (excepting for the confusion) but merely a result of changing something major in bitcoin land. Now, is a major fork like this going to happen and crash bitcoin? Probably not. You don't need to worry much 
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:17:14
Sure! Heres a copy of my other comment about why price and market cap arent equal, and how that applies to the Dow :)












@_date: 2017-03-04 15:31:33
No, it's not. And that's the argument about the DOW too.
An example, we both own companies that are worth $100. I have two $50 shares, and you have 100 $1 shares. Lets say that my company has a really good year this year, and I make $4. That's an 4% increase in the value of my company. Your company has a bad year, and you lose $4, a 4% loss. The Dow will strictly compare prices between the two. As a result of that $4 gain on my end, my share price is now $52, and as a result of your $4 loss, your share price is now $.96.
Obviously, if 1/2 of the market has risen x amount, and 1/2 has fallen x amount, then the net result is equal. But the Dow would register that as a total change of my gain minus your loss *per share price*. Which would be a total change of $2-$.04, or $1.96.
And the Dow jones would have gone up 3.8% on the day.
EDIT -- Planet Money ran a really good article about this exact problem with the Dow, plus others, 4 years ago, it's worth a listen!

No self respecting market person would use the DOW anyways. S&amp;P 500 or the Wilshire 5000 are leaps and bounds ahead. (Let me know if anyone wants an explanation, I'm on mobile now and can type more out later on pc)

But you do keep your lawnmower in a garage, right?
Surely you don't leave it sitting out in your yard all the time, unless you live in the middle of nowhere. Everything has pros and cons.
And yeah, same thing with cash. Leave it sitting in your yard, or even if you drop it on the ground, and there you go.

The USA probably has a shit ton they've seized from those arrested (and maybe even those not arrested, via civil forfeiture)
I'd assume the main source for most countries is the same, theft is easier than making something yourself
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:45:26
Yup, sorry, I misspoke. You are correct
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:55:34
That fee is worth about $0.09, which is really not going to be incentive to include it into a block quickly. The other person you commented to pointed out that it's only 11 s/B which is not going to be great for speed
You'll probably have to wait a while for it to transfer, but it will transfer eventually
But yup, next time just bump the fee up a little if you need it transferred quickly
Edit -- words and stuff yo
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:44:51
It won't be 1 year. 4-ish years until the next big spike coming probably in 2020, after the next halvening... Right now that looks like it will occur on June 16th, 2020. There could be a littler spike in 2018, followed by a downturn in late 2018/2019.
We'll see a huge correction in the next month, and then bitcoin will die to the media, just as it was in 2016, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, etc, etc, etc.
But it will rise from the flames, and in a couple crashes people will say that "Bitcoin fell from its all time high of $250,000 down to $100,000, bitcoin is dead!"
And so on, and so forth, until we hit the moon :)
(And then they'll say it's dead 6 months later)

BTC goes up in difficulty, miners shift to BCH.
BTC then drops in difficulty, miners shift back, and ride the waves of easy blocks until BTC corrects again.
In the meantime, BCH difficulty has crashed again, and the cycle continues
It's been going on for a little bit, it's about to get a lot worse in the next few days/weeks until the markets steady some 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:25:31
It does change, really mostly depending on how the Bitcoin mining difficulty is. Right now it's fluctuating a lot and I bet that fee estimation was off
Of course, there's no way for you to have known that was going on behind the scenes.
To be honest, it's a pretty big flaw of Bitcoin, the average user just wants the transaction to go through as fast as possible for as cheap as possible and Bitcoin is expensive to move
Also, check here:
You're in that lowest section, but still way above everyone who didn't include a fee at all... Unfortunately that doesn't mean much since the majority of those transactions are sitting completely unconfirmed in &gt;12 hours.
But it looks like you might be waiting for a while, sorry friend. It'll get sent as soon as the network starts chewing through that huge backlog of low miners fee transactions
Edit -- nevermind, looks like you've got two confirmations. Just remember to throw in a little extra for the miners next time :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:59:03
The first bitcoin transaction to my knowledge was a pizza for 10000 BTC, so if you found the people who had the BTC, you could get it. Later on, you could probably get a lot more coins more easily on an exchange, like MTGOX, but by that point you were looking at dollar amounts instead of the $.01 to $.10 range. Sorry, there's not really a better answer than that.
Edit, I misspoke and because of that, I am completely wrong. Please see the explanation below from the other commenters.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:07:36
Lol headlight fluid :)
But in seriousness, change all your fluids on a schedule, replace air/etc filters on a schedule, make sure to get a good oil filter and use synthetic when you change your oil, break it in properly if you buy a new car, change spark plugs and all the other minor stuff on a schedule to maintain good performance
It's really just about keeping it maintained properly and replacing stuff as it breaks, I've only used a mechanic twice for transmission issues. Other than that I refuse to pay someone else money to fix my own car

Sorry, I will do that next time I encounter such a website.
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:57:30
[Here's a thread on bitcoin talk about this website, first of all](
I was surfing earlier today and I came across a link to this website, and it didn't look right. Everything about this website is sketchy, from their guarantee to assemble and deliver your device within 14 days, to the 1-year warranty (not even enough to be sold where they are claiming to make their product), [to the fact that their website was registered 6 days ago.](
They only take Bitcoin for transactions, which they claim is just for anonymity's sake, but I don't think I would trust them with a single one of my bitcoin.
Just wanted to start this thread for more information, if anyone has some, or to possibly warn some of the non-veteran bitcoin users we might have against purchasing from this website.
@_date: 2016-09-07 11:25:29
That's literally what a small-scale Bitcoin money launderer would do.
A bank is a private business, and they have the legal right to serve whomever they want.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:00:30
Put some money into it and then store it somewhere secret and secure. Like an offline computer only used for Bitcoin or a paper wallet.
Then (this is the key) don't panic sell
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:09:24
Or they could have just made their comment a link...
That way we could have both the clean joke for the people who get it, and the information for the people who don't. Just a suggestion

Users are anyone who uses something. I don't see it as a stretch at all to see several million people who used a bitcoin faucet and got .01 bitcoin 3 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:28:01
And that's perfectly fine, man. Also, with the above comment about the number of addresses, I probably should round down my estimate to a million at most. Though hopefully that'll change in the near future
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:14:24
A friend of mine told me that at either $5 or $10 back when $16 was the all time high.
I cashed out most of mine at $100 for a sweet profit a few months before MtGox.
I still have enough to say I told you so, and that makes me happy inside :)

Not the other guy, but it seems like the price of Bitcoin is rising due to the media coverage of Bitcoin rising.
People are not acting rationally, and the market will crash as soon as a few large investors realize that their coins could be worth a lot less very soon...
Same thing as 2013 (Apr and Nov) and the same thing as it will be again in another 3 or 4 years time. The cycle continues.

That disclaimer is basically so that he can tell the feds "no, it's not drugs, it's a legitimate product," kind of like your local dealer telling you not to roll a joint and smoke the weed he just sold to you, so as to say that it's not a drug. Of course, it doesn't work in the real world.
