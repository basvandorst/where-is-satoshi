So silly question on these bank run style events... are people taking out their life savings?  If so, wouldn't it just take the first person to drain the ATM?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:40:09
So couldn't people purchase foreign equities or currencies online from Greece w/ their Euros to "transfer the value" out of their assets?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:49:40
Oh, didn't think of that.  So I guess one would just keep hopping from one ATM to another?  For lots of these folks, wouldn't it take a long time to withdraw their life savings?
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:02:21
Ok that's really damn cool!  Thanks for the BTC and learning about changetip.   Now I need to read more about testnet!  :)
So basically by subscribing to changetip, there was no fee for you to send?
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:53:35
Thanks for helping with my hands on learning today.  :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:13:45


That just broke my brain box again.  
@_date: 2014-10-12 18:28:26
Lots of people don't pay annual fees for their cc.  
Now if merchants discount your transactions for bitcoins like some do for cash, then that'd be great.

What do most Argentinian professionals think about alternate currencies to yours in general?  ...I mean, there's such a desire to own dollars for example.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:55:14
The wiki seems to imply that these fees are at least partially there because my test transactions have been so small (less than 0.01 BTC).
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:05:23
Ha, thanks man!  changetip is an interesting concept.  
Ok, so I'm trying to figure out how much "50 bits" is.  I see 0.00244182 received.  I'm assuming that like that you didn't have to pay any fees by using changetip?

Quick question.  
So I sent $0.35's worth to another wallet but I see from blockchain's visualization that it went to two places.  
The receiving wallet got the $0.35 but it deducted $0.38 (0.00119btc) from my originating wallet. 
[Ok here's the transaction.  Can someone ELI5 me what happened to the other amount?](
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:46:57
Fine.  Have a penny @_date: 2014-11-02 21:05:57
Hey hijacking the top comment to thank everyone for answering my n00b questions.  I definitely have more testing/learning to do.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:56:47
Hmmm.... I don't see it.  I've been tracking the tests and can account for each one so far but not this one.  What was the exact BTC amount?  Hopefully it wasn't a common rounded value.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:08:55
That is precisely why I can't wait to see more of these machines.  Hopefully they'll have ones that go the other way too.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:21:28
Ok, so I started with 0.00304989btc as shown in the imgur link for this post.
I sent 0.00119 of it to an address for wallet 
When I look at wallet  I see only 0.00109 received.  
What happened to the 0.0001 "change"?
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:24:12
I think that's the answer.
@_date: 2014-11-03 02:13:25

@_date: 2014-10-12 18:14:49
What recourse do you have if you sent the wrong amount or if you didn't receive the goods or services after the money is sent?
With cc or traditional banks, they'd be incentivized to work with the merchant to resolve. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:23:53
Hmm... that didn't work.  
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:17:09
I have two test wallets.  I sent from the 1st to the 2nd.  The second receiving address for the 0.00119btc isn't mine.  
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:28:14
WTF.  I just saw this fee.  FEE?
EDIT:  Looks like someone had some fun.  Someone sent the exact amount deducted from the fees to the address I used for wallet  rather than the test address for wallet   It had the possibly desired effect of me thinking at the time that I got the fee refunded or something.  I thought the address I created for wallet  was private but I just realized the blockchain transaction I posted above had that address in it.  (duh).  This is becoming a fun way to learn.  Thanks again everybody!

Glad this is a good mechanism to keep your hands out of the cookie jar!  Whatever can keep your rate of savings up is a good thing.  Though do note that whether it's your intention or not that you're effectively doing "dollar cost averaging" but with bitcoins instead of typical equities.  As a result, the value of bitcoins could be as big or bigger of a determination of what you end up with than your actual savings rate.

@_date: 2014-10-12 23:51:17
Well the best part of credit cards is the protection you get in the event you don't get the expected product or service from a merchant since the cc company is on the hook until you pay them.  There's none of that with bitcoins.

Is there a way I can find your receiving address to send you something back just from the transaction of you sending something to me?  e.g. like a reply-to BTC send?
EDIT:  Since I'm still learning... I don't want to post the sender address.  Not sure if that's an appropriate thing to publicly post.  For the address in that transaction, is that a send only address or can that be used for me to send something back to?
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:55:00

Ok I see what just happened.  I didn't realize (again, my education has not been as thorough as you guys) that changetip created a wallet for the tips to go to.  
I watched their video and saw how to invoke the tip but didn't know how the transaction would actually happen.  I see how that it's possible bc it simply has a separate wallet associated w/ your reddit account.
Very cool stuff

Serious question...
For commodities or precious metals, I can see the appeal to not own the physical underlying assets for lots of reasons.  Liquidity, storage, security, etc.
Wouldn't it actually be easier/cheaper/safer to just buy some bitcoins instead of an ETF to track or hold actual bitcoins for you?

Right, education and sharing news like this can help make the practical case for digital currency and one day move it from the minds of everyday people from just "internet money" to a real world alternative.

That 1702 monitor was great even after I got an Amiga.  Since the monitor supported separating luminance and color, it was almost like S-Video.  Really crisp / high quality for the price even at the time.
As a bonus, I like how it had standard audio/video-in in the front for other things like console systems.  
Loved it!

re: the strobe effect, fun fact that happened to me:  War Games was a popular movie and so I decided to write a simple BASIC prg to make the clicking sound of each letter being "printed" on the screen.  I found that turning the SID chip on and off made a click sound.  So I had it turn off and on for pages of text.
Found out doing this can actually fry your SID chip!  First time breaking something through "code".  lol
