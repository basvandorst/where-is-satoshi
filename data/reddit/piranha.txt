The great thing about Bitcoin is you get the freedom to choose.  You can choose to let someone else manage your private key if you think that's going to work better for you.  And you can still transact with people that would rather self-manage.

I know the Mt. Gox user list, with e-mail addresses and hashed passwords and all, was leaked a couple years ago.  If it were current, it'd be a great source of potential Coinbase users (or useful for any other Bitcoin-related phish attempt/scam you can think of).  I'm sure there have been other site database leaks.

There is protection, in the math.  It won't protect you from user error, you're right.


Why not?  Cracking is illegal, and so is theft.

Talk to them.  Also, there's some details missing here.  Are they saying that for whatever reason the source funding method didn't go through?  Tell them that the output funds (the Bitcoins) can't be returned but as soon as you've verified that you really do have the source funds after all--because surely they haven't gone through or they've been returned if they're asking for this (right?)--then offer to try paying them again.

Because a small percentage of the population has an irrational fear of Bitcoin.  They read some lies and maybe those lies cross-pollinated with other lies in their head and now they just don't want to have anything to do with it.

No need to take their Bitcoins first.  Just include the address on the paper document and have them send them there.  The island treasurers will be holding onto the private key as well, so really it's like joint-ownership of an account.
No need to get fancy with scratch-off stuff or forgery prevention.  How about just a piece of paper with the private key and address?  And at that rate, it doesn't need to be delivered as a piece of paper, it could be a text file or PDF (as long as the document is handled securely: encrypted, printed, then deleted would work).

The value of the currency has nothing to do with the mining difficulty.  Whoever wrote about "Litecoin" doesn't seem to get how Bitcoin mining works: there is no fixed difficulty.  Difficulty has increased over a millionfold since the inception of Bitcoin in order to throttle block generation frequency.  Bitcoin wasn't designed for fast computers, the market has chosen fast computers to mine blocks, because it turns out you get the most money that way.  Duh.  GPU compute capacity would be applied to Litecoin just the same way (except it wouldn't because people don't care about yet another Bitcoin fork).

It's a bad idea to post a single address for payment among all potential customers like that: if I were to send you 8 BTC, someone else could be running a script to monitor for that event and then immediately send an email claiming that they just paid while giving their shipping address.  If I had used a Bitcoin wallet service, then there might never be a way to prove who lied and who paid.

Dwolla is a Paypal wannabe that will let you move your money to an exchange (or back).  They don't convert the currency, so you'll use it to fund USD in an exchange like MtGox, where you'll pay market rates plus a small commission (say 0.5% IIRC).  The cost is 0.25 USD to send to the exchange, and I believe the exchange is also charged 0.25 USD to receive the money, so the total cost (passed onto you) is 0.50 USD + the trade commission.  It'll take about up to about a week to move money from your bank account to Dwolla, and that's after they verify that you own the bank account (a one-time process that adds some more days).
I'm not a fan of Dwolla for these reasons:
  * The probationary period.
  * They started asking for social security numbers.  No bueno.
  * At a point in time, Dwolla promised that their payments were non-repudiable.  Someone ripped them off with ACH fraud, so Dwolla lost out on that money, and then passed that cost onto one of their customers, the now-defunct exchange TradeHill.  It sucks that Dwolla was out that money, but they violated their promise in effectively passing on the fraud.  (In a most non-transparent and unethical way, I might add.  They tried to change or delete ledger entries for their dealings with TradeHill.  They tried to make it look like the transaction where TradeHill got money had never happened.)

That video seems to demonstrate how one particular poker service and its PRNG were broken.  It has no technical information, so it doesn't belong in this thread.  And it's no certainly indictment against all PRNGs.
Can you actually explain what's wrong with a PRNG here?  There is a potential problem that can affect inappropriately-chosen PRNGs, but you have yet to bring it up!  You even compared a PRNG to Fisher-Yates--the two are completely orthogonal--which tells me you really don't know what you're talking about.

That doesn't ensure that the coin is worth anything.  The only way that method would ever show less value than face value is when the issuer is cheating, but if they're cheating, then the public key might not match the private key hidden inside.

If you're buying to speculate, then whatever.  Can't give you advice one way or the other.
If you're buying Bitcoin because you think the technology is rad and want to participate in the market, then it doesn't really matter when you buy.  Unless things are swinging wildly, which they aren't, we generally gradually adjust prices of goods and services to match the value of the Bitcoin.

A shuffle and a RNG are an apple and an orange.  More to the point, a shuffle algorithm (including correct ones like F-Y) needs a RNG.  It builds on a RNG.  It is a client of the RNG.  And most practical RNGs in use in computing are PRNG, and that's okay.

We do have alternative implementations.  And I think it's only a matter of time until Bitcoin, as separate network and block protocols, are formalized IETF-style.  Chances are that this broadcast-message functionality would be relegated to a vendor-specific extension in that case.
Let's put it this way.  Somebody has to (had to) develop the protocol and reference implementation.  It could not have spontaneously appeared out of the aether from the collective will of technocrats everywhere.  Naturally that one person (succeeded now by one group) will have a certain amount of practical power over the system as a whole.  If this is terribly unsettling to you (and it's a good concern to have), then do your part by using, testing, and developing existing alternative implementations, or write your own.  I think Bitcoin client diversity will be very important for the long-term success of the system.

It's my understanding that the legal threats occurred after a private request via e-mail to return the funds.  Yeah, that wasn't the most diplomatic way to go about things.  But keeping thousands of dollars worth of money due to someone else's mistake?  Rudeness on the part of the guy who accidentally sent the money doesn't excuse that.
But by selling or doing anything with the money, he did take it.  He didn't set out to actively defraud anyone or crack a server or system as far as I know, but by spending it, he's accepted it, and taken it.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is not sustainable over Tor.  It's fine if you have one client you want to put behind Tor, but the strength of the network relies on non-Tor nodes for connecting to peers.
That is, a Tor node can connect to a non-Tor, listening node.  No node--Tor or otherwise--can ever make a connection to a Tor node, though.  (Not without hacks and contortions: manually mapping bogus RFC 1918 addresses to hidden service keys and then asking Bitcoin to connect to the bogus addresses.)
It'd be great to see the protocol extended to support other connection media besides raw IP addresses, like DNS hostnames (which might include Tor .onion hostnames).
@_date: 2011-09-04 02:28:03
It might work in many cases, but in some it won't:
  * Generation due to a miner pointing their bounty at you.  St. Eligius does payouts this way.  In this case, there simply isn't a return address.
  * Wallet services: there's no guarantee that the service will have established that funds sent to the return address will point back to the original account holder.  Your funds might just end up in the general fund pool of the wallet service provider, in which case you'll need to then ask them to direct payment onto the intended recipient.
  * And any situation where somebody sends the money, and then forgets about it: reformats their hard drive, stops using the computer, or whatever.
For these reasons, you need cooperation to return funds.  How you can be sure that you're communicating with the right person--the one that authorized the funds--is a different matter.
If you send BTC to an address that doesn't exist, it's lost in the ether.  (But the Bitcoin client stops you from fat-fingering addresses with a four-character checksum.)

Turned out to be a font problem.  Firebug reported that the computed value of the text-transform property was "none", and I didn't see anything else that may have caused all caps.  Dynamically removing "hoefler text" from the font list in the page style resulted in correct capitalization.  I don't really know anything about that typeface, but if Hoefler Text is desired, maybe there's a more specific font name that should be referenced?

Cool ideas.  The problem to be solved is how to convey a certain amount of Bitcoins to somebody without their prior cooperation (without knowing one of their public keys).
Having a standard defined for account private key exchange would be great for this, and for e-mailing somebody an amount of Bitcoins (encrypted to the OpenPGP public key of theirs that you already know, of course!).  Such a standard might look like the classic -----BEGIN PGP xxx BLOCK----- format, and would need an Internet media type assigned for its use.
It's secure as long as the recipient trusts the sender, and nobody eavesdrops.  And if the recipient doesn't trust the sender, they can immediately spend the coins to a private key that only they know and the transaction takes the same amount of time as usual to clear (after the spending event).
Good practice IMO would be to have the sender actually retain the private key until the recipient confirms that they received it.  Otherwise, a lost or truncated bounced e-mail (or snail mail) could result in the loss of the money.

URLs are encrypted when HTTPS is being used.  (But it's aesthetically better to use HTTP authentication than to put the credentials in a URL.)  Are you saying that the APIs you saw used non-SSL HTTP?

Sounds like a responsible position.  Bitcoin must distance itself from things that will tarnish its image in the eyes of lawmakers and the public.  (As long as "cooperation with authorities" doesn't mean a JAP-style backdoor.)
But also, maybe this is a mischaracterization of jgarzik; I don't think the author *gets it*.  He likens Bitcoin to a "company" and "site," and doesn't at all emphasize that the mining/inflation is an algorithmic property, as if the mining were a centralized, human-directed policy that Bitcoin users have to trust.
Waiting to download and watch video.  Interested to see jgarzik speak, and hoping the video is better and meatier on details.
* * *
Edit: Yup, that was a pretty shitty video.  Sensational questions slung by people perhaps paid to be on television more for their looks (the hipsters on the left?!) than for any insightful or intelligent discussion.  That said, jgarzik seems like a good speaker, but he was a little bit too technical but also hand-wavy from the perspective of a non-technical audience; I think he could have done better to reassure the skeptical, non-technical interviewer.
@_date: 2011-06-03 03:08:44
It does require sender cooperation in order for the recipient to be sure the money gets back.  What if the sender used a wallet service like MyBitcoin or configured their pooled mining account to direct funds straight to EFF?  Returned money would end up *somewhere* (MyBitcoin operators, pool operators), but might not make it to the hands of the true original owner.
Additionally, someone could have mined and had all generated coins directed to the EFF.  In that case, there was no sender recorded for the transaction, the money "just appeared."  The Eligius mining pool (if not others) conducts payouts by including your designated recipient address in the magic coin-generation transaction of a found block--I guess generated coins can be immediately divided among several addresses, rather than the usual case of directing it to a single address.

Is it that you believe "warning" is a euphemism or a mere suggested use of a feature that can completely take over your Bitcoin node?  Because it can't.  It's just a warning.  Informational.  That is the scope of control.  Or are you trying to make a slippery slope argument?
Most of the time when people tell you to fork Bitcoin, you might have an incompatible client.  If it disturbs you so deeply that someone somewhere has the ability to *send you a message*, you could just remove a few lines of code and have a *completely compatible Bitcoin client*.  Or use an alternative implementation that doesn't implement this.  Or write your own.
Can't do that with the Federal Reserve Bank!

What makes you think that Dwolla is unregulated?  They are a legitimate business based in Iowa that deals in US dollars, not Bitcoins.  They do ACH transactions, so they have to be part of the system and subject to all the regulations that are the norm for US banking.  They chose to renege on a promise they made to their customers and stole money from their customers as part of that process.  Their customers could sue them, and maybe even win.
But ultimately any of these stories could have happened with dollars.  "I handed all my money to a shady guy in the alley who never let me see his face, and now I can't find him anymore."  Where does the regulated status of USD come to help in this case?

I tried that, and it was a mistake.
I wanted to convert as much of 50 USD from a debit card into BTC.  It's not a lot of money, so  probably would've been best, but I wanted it as soon as possible (*Hee-yaw!  Imma gonna get me in on this here bubble!*).
There's a fee that they passed on when I used Moneybookers to get money from my debit card to my Virwox account--reasonable enough.  And then there's a fee for exchanging USD to SLL.  And then there's a fee for exchanging SLL to BTC.  And then there's a fee for pulling the BTC out of Virwox and into my own Bitcoin wallet.  (Virwox won't directly convert USD to BTC; SLL is a mandatory middle step.)
Additionally, I couldn't spend all the USD in my Virwox account on SLL--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of USD to spend (which was fractional due to the Moneybookers fee).  Once as much of my money as possible was in SLL, I couldn't spend all the SLL in my Virwox account on BTC--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of BTC *to buy*.  (One BTC is worth about 7.5 USD, so that can be quite an overhead.)
So here's where my money went:
  * 50 USD in bank account.
  * Transfer 50 USD from bank via debit card and Moneybookers to my Virwox account.  Moneybookers takes 2.24 USD.  Virwox balance is 47.76 USD.  Cumulative loss: 2.24 USD
  * Exchange 47.76 USD to SLL.  Oops!  Can't, must be a whole number of USD.  I have to forfeit 0.76 USD to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD
  * Really exchange 47.00 USD to 12,107.20 SLL.  Rate of 257.60 SLL per USD--not the best rate in the world since I chose the market order option, which fills the order instantly.  Virwox collects a commission of 352.68 SLL (payable only in SLL, so that 0.76 USD in limbo won't help here).  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 352.68 SLL (totaling ~ 4.36 USD)
  * Exchange 11,754.52 SLL (the balance) to BTC.  Oops!  Must buy a whole number of BTC.  Forfeit 89.52 SLL to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 442.20 SLL (totaling ~ 4.72 USD).
  * Really exchange 11,500 SLL to 5 BTC.  Rate of 2366 SLL per BTC; again, chose a market order.  Virwox collects a commission of 165 SLL.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 607.20 SLL (totaling ~ 5.36 USD)
  * Send 5 BTC (the balance) from my Virwox account to my wallter.  Virwox collects 0.02 BTC commission.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 607.20 SLL + 0.02 BTC (totaling ~ 5.54 USD).
So in the end, I spent more than 10% of my money in fees and bullshit overheads (the limbo balances of USD and SLL).
Do not recommend.

100% traceable by design.  When account X sends BTC N.NN to account Y, that transaction is entered into the public record here and forever more.  The semblance of anonymity comes from:
1. Bitcoin accounts aren't linked *directly* to your real-world identity.  (And you can have as many accounts as you can create private keys, without even communicating with the network.  And computer programs can generate and operate accounts, so an account doesn't even necessarily belong to a person.)
2. The current tool for tracing Bitcoin transactions, [blockexplorer.com]( makes it cumbersome to follow money and hard to get the gist of things.
If you want a good idea of how you can be tracked through Bitcoin, try watching The Wire.  (Different subject matter, but same idea: good old-fashioned detective work, follow the money.)  I'm certain that with adequate tools to analyze and visualize the graph of Bitcoin activity (with accounts as vertices and transactions as edges), it will be quite feasible to figure out where someone spent some money, or where someone obtained some money from.
That said, I love Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn't solve the problem of how to transact anonymously.  It solves the problem of creating a distributed currency that stands up for itself due to mathematics, probability, and global cooperation--without having to trust a benevolent central authority who might later be tempted to steal, through seizure or unpredicted inflation.  You just have to trust the majority of Bitcoin stakeholders--it's like a collective contract among everyone.

The one point I can really agree with here is that the discovery of a security flaw in the design of Bitcoin will be devastating.
If a break occurs today, a lot of people will be upset and lose money and we'll need to pick up the pieces for Bitcoin's successor.  But it won't be devastating on a wide scale.
If a break occurs 10 years from now, a lot more people will be affected, with the opportunity for much more lost wealth.  The need for Bitcoin's safety will increase as the Bitcoin economy grows.  But as the Bitcoin economy grows, more people will be searching for flaws, and so long as a break is not found, the vetted safety of Bitcoin will also increase in proportion to the Bitcoin economy.

Mining (whether CPU or GPU) at break-even might be useful: you're buying Bitcoin with electricity, without dealing with banks and exchanges and Dwolla.
Mining at slightly worse than break-even might even be rational: you're exploiting the credit you have with your utility company and the time value of money.  (You don't have to pay them for 5-45 days, depending on when you get your next bill and what their payment terms are.)

Indeed!  It could store the public keys of addresses it knows are available.
So how about this?  Make a "wallet" a first-class, uniquely-identified (random UUID), user-named ("Savings") object that can be written out to disk.  Generated keys would always be associated with, and stored in, one wallet or another.  Let the client keep information about each wallet it knows about; call this a "wallet reference."  Wallet references contain the UUID of the wallet and a list of known public keys (historical and pre-generated).
To receive money, the client just chooses the next unused public key from its wallet reference.  Doesn't matter whether the wallet is active in the client's memory at that moment; it could be buried in your garden.
To list transactions, it searches for payments made to all public keys it knows about.  And tags each line item with the name of the associated wallet.  Wallets could take the role that accounts currently fill.  To list balances, it simply adds up transactions for each wallet reference.
To pay, you choose the wallet reference to pay from.  You confirm, and are prompted to provide the wallet file if it's not active in RAM at the moment.  The client could remember where the wallet was last stored, and present an Open dialog box if it's not where it left it last.  The wallet could be optionally encrypted, in which case you're prompted for your passphrase at the same time.
The client should also have the option to delete wallet references, for:
  * Privacy: if you're cracked, you might not want the attacker to know you have a wallet with 10kBTC somewhere.
  * Sending wallets to friends that trust you, as a quick, tangible, and untracked (wBitcoin blocks) way to transfer money.  Keeping the wallet reference after transferring the wallet would cause confusion on your end, seeing balances that no longer apply to you.  Because wallets are treated by the client as being strictly separate, you know that sending wallet X won't accidentally leak any of the money (private keys) from wallet Y.
@_date: 2011-07-24 22:50:13


Maybe!  That's would be up to the protocols to decide.  The Bitcoin protocol would award the miner (which would now be more aptly named the "discoverer") the right to some Bitcoins, as long as the discoverer includes a special bit of information in the block required in order to claim those coins.  That special information would be equivalent to current index-0 generation transactions: it would be granted a license to divide n (currently 50) Bitcoins up as it sees fit.
The Bitcoin client (which I'll now call the distributed timestamping client) would have hooks to allow plugins to shape the way discovered blocks are made.  A Bitcoin plugin would ensure that the "generated" transaction is included.  Other protocols that layer on top of the timestamping network could define their own additional incentives.
Bitcoin might need to be special-cased into the system anyway, in order to charge people for the information they include in the timestamping platform.
Part of why I'd like to see this, besides generalizing Bitcoin for useful things that need its timestamping, is so that Namecoin as a credits system can be eschewed.  Having a separate currency seemed so counter-intuitive.  On the other hand, an disincentive to mass-registration of names for squatting will be needed, so assigning a cost to a name is a good idea.

It's mostly decentralized.  The central control right now rests in software development, and that's only a risk when you and other participants upgrade or [re]install.

To add to your explanation: you can create multiple Bitcoin "accounts," which are basically collections of addresses that you can label whatever you like--e.g. "business", "family", "donations", etc.  (To my understanding, not having really used the accounts feature before) Bitcoin sums the balances of all addresses belonging to the same account and presents that as the single balance for an account.
When you ask Bitcoin to see your address (or the address of a certain account), you're really seeing a brand-new address that's never been used before.  The reason why it does this is because you're encouraged to use fresh addresses like this, and that's because doing that helps protect your privacy--it makes it harder for people to correlate your Bitcoin activity.  For example, if you give out the same address X to receive payment for anything, then anyone sending you money will be able to tell who else is sending you money, and at what amounts.  But if you give out address X to one guy and address Y to another guy, then the first guy won't be able to immediately tell that you're also getting payment from the other guy.
As for the chance of hitting the same Bitcoin address as somebody else by luck, it's possible, but smarter money is on the alien mothership colonizing Earth tomorrow at 15:47 UTC.

In your scenario (hashrate goes down to 30%*70%), at the worst case of these conditions occurring instantly after a difficulty change, we would have a 67-day period of blocks being found once every 48 minutes on average rather than once every 10 minutes.
Bitcoin is large enough, much larger than Namecoin I imagine, that the 2016-block difficulty granularity is probably sufficient to prevent the kind of downward spiral you suggest, where the 2016th block is never discovered.

If that's how you choose to estimate whether a transaction has cleared or not, anybody could double-spend their payments to you with a pretty high success rate.
If you were to give me $1000 cash for some BTC, guess what would happen when I send you the BTC (with the transaction instantly becoming visible to you), but then secretly send the same money to myself at another address.  Either my transaction to you "wins" or it doesn't, and if it does win then I'll just keep trying until I get free money from you.

A hash meets the required target when the hash value is less than **or equal to** the target value (a subtle but counterintuitive point).  Difficulty is a non-integer metric that is useful for gauging  the difficulty of finding a block, but as far as I can tell, difficulty isn't used for anything other than a user-interface convenience.  The meat and potatoes of Bitcoin code seems to just use the hash target (as a bignum) and the compact form of the hash target.  (The "bits" field of a block conveys the compact of the target met by the hash of the block.)
difficulty = decode_compact(proof_of_work_limit.compact) / target
proof_of_work_limit = 2^224 - 1
proof_of_work_limit.compact = 486604799
A "compact" representation of an integer (aka the "bits" of an integer) is an approximation of the integer's magnitude.  It's basically defined in terms of an OpenSSL bignum serialization format, and could stand to be properly defined (but unfortunately "compact" is used in the Bitcoin binary block protocol, not just the network protocol or implementation details).  c.f. Bitcoin bignum.h class CBigNum for the original C++ code which relies on that OpenSSL format.
Here's a Common Lisp function I wrote to decode compact values.  It's greatly simplified from the original C++ code which effectively incorporated OpenSSL implementation details by reference.  I'm reasonably certain it's correct (as correct as it can be with respect to a defined-by-implementation formula) but I'm not 100% positive that it is.
    ;;; Cheatsheet:
    ;;; (byte SIZE POS) selects SIZE bits starting POS (0 or more) bits from the least significant bit.
    ;;; (ldb BYTE-SPEC INTEGER) does the bit-fiddling needed to get or set the portion of INTEGER expressed by BYTE-SPEC.
    ;;; (ash INT BITS) shifts INT by BITS (left for positive BITS, right for negative BITS).
    (defun decode-compact (compact)
      (let* ((magnitude (ldb (byte 8 24) compact))
             (positive-p (zerop (ldb (byte 1 23) compact)))
             (rest (ldb (byte 23 0) compact))
             (abs-value (ash rest (* 8 (- magnitude 3)))))
        (if positive-p abs-value (- abs-value))))

"More leading zeroes" might be a helpful concept to understand the gist of what's going on, but hash targets actually aren't defined in terms of how many leading zeroes there must be.
For example, the target for block 132508 was 0000000000001321850000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 hexadecimal.  Any hash whose numeric value was less than or equal to that (with no special treatment to zero-digits) would have met the target.

Well as it stands, with 99% of users running the reference implementation, the strength of Bitcoin critically depends on the state of this single client.
I argue that the complexity and flaws in the reference implementation hint that there are probably exploitable security bugs lurking around.  Once (not if, but when) a particularly greedy and short-sighted blackhat discovers one, he or she will be in a position not only to exploit single clients, but write a worm that spreads through established peer-to-peer links in the Bitcoin network.  This worm could steal money from the majority of those running the Bitcoin reference implementation.  This event will **devastate** the public's confidence in Bitcoin as a technology, and you can expect that the value of BTC will plummet.  If this occurs, it will be a miracle for the Bitcoin community to pick up the pieces and regain strength and trust once again.
1. Let's audit the fucking code and clean it up in a big way.
2. Let's promote secure practices (encryption of the wallet, a major goal of the next release if I understand correctly; keeping separate wallets for separate levels of risk).
3. Let's promote diversity in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Let's make alternative implementations that are so compelling in their superiority to the reference implementation's UI (or other features) that we'll see significant numbers of users switch to different clients.

I think Bruce Wagner made his position clear.  He did not ask for the assistance of the FBI, the FBI asked for his assistance.
But that's beside the point.  The MyBitcoin guy has been reckless and irresponsible with people's money.  If his story doesn't pan out and nobody gets their money back, he will have stolen a considerable amount of money.  Regardless of the currency involved, that's a serious crime, and law enforcement should be getting involved to see to it that we get a positive outcome out of this.
Having a decentralized currency and complete anarchocapitalism are two related, but orthogonal concepts.  You can have one without the other.^1  You can also believe in one without believing in the other.  It is not hypocritical to desire an unregulated **currency** (one set of the mechanics, supply, and generation of money) and to desire the **law enforcement and judicial services** that you're already paying for to investigate and prosecute for acts of fraud committed against you.  (The key point is that currency and the law enforcement system are two different things.)
And then for account for those people that fall into the quadrant of wanting completely decentralized currency *and* no government to investigate and prosecute criminals: they are probably shaking their heads and chalking this up to negligence, not screaming for the authorities.

That'd be a great way to scare someone off.
Bitcoin is a new currency and method of payment that is powered by a peer-to-peer network.  It's backed by math rather than government trust, and it was carefully designed so that it's not in the control of any single person or organization, making it trustworthy and effectively cheat-proof.  You don't need anyone's permission to use Bitcoin--no names, social security numbers, or credit checks required.  With Bitcoin, nobody can stop you from using your money the way you'd like to use it, so payments are usually quick and very cheap (less than a cent), anywhere in the world.
And then move onto comparison with other currencies and methods of payment: taxation of fiat via inflation; credit card fees; the fact that credit cards are producer/consumer, not peer/peer, so you have to use middlemen like Paypal to send money online from your checking account or credit card, and these middlemen  collect a handsome commission to transfer money; etc.
I would never mention Bitcoin as an investment to someone that you want to sell the idea of Bitcoin to.  That's a "perk" they can discover later if they want to speculate with their money.

1) True, but they're using e-mail incorrectly here.  They could prompt for an encryption password or public key ID or something.  Smarter yet would be to prompt for a Bitcoin address.
2) The paper could come out folded.
3) How often does this happen?  Technology exists to solve this 100%: keep two rolls of paper.  Don't use ink.  When the primary roll runs out, signal for a technician to come, and then switch to the backup roll.
4) You could just as easily e-mail someone a private key yourself (with encryption), or transfer it via Bitcoin, or punch in someone else's Bitcoin address straight into the kiosk.  Plus, with Bitcoin addresses, you get a strong integrity check, but nothing will could stop you from fat-fingering an e-mail address into the kiosk.

The only way to truly verify it is to break the seal and destroy the value of that coin.  (In principle, you convert the value to normal BTC but lose the physical vessel containing it.)  That creates a strong disincentive to double-check that Casascius, the producer of the coins, is acting honestly: A 1 BTC Casascius coin should always in principle cost more than 1 BTC.
Casascius could basically fraudulently mint any number of coins, such as 0.1%, or a fixed number, like 100 coins.  That fraud can be detected, but only once one of those specific fraud coins is opened.  The Casascius folks could even stage it to look as if the discoverer of the fraud were in fact the one acting dishonestly.  The fraud could be done at any point in time, not just at the time of minting: for example, 10 years from now, and it would not be detectable until then.
On the flip side, a malicious person could buy a bunch of these coins and a bunch of sockpuppets, and open the seals, redeem the BTC, and then accuse Casascius of fraud even if they did no such thing.  This would be drawn out slowly over time, done across multiple online pseudonyms/sockpuppets.  This would only serve to wreck the Casascius name, not Bitcoin itself.
I prefer to remain skeptical and not use or keep these coins.

Password security isn't based on length, it's based on predictability.
For example, it's generally a bad idea to use a dictionary word as your password.  "candlestick" is a worse password than "ajvlbVP6", even though it is longer.  "candlestick" can conceivably be predicted in fewer steps than it would take to predict "ajvlbVP6",  and I'll show you how.
"candlestick" was chosen basically at random from a dictionary file I have.  "ajvlbVP6" was chosen at random with uniform distribution from all 8-character passwords consisting of upper- and lower-case letters and digits.
"candlestick" is word  in my 98569-word dictionary.  Whereas "ajvlbVP6" is password  of all 218,340,105,584,896 such passwords (if you go from uppercase, to lowercase, to digits; otherwise, if you count lowercase characters first, it's password 
Why does this matter?  Because a password cracker, or a rainbow table generator, employs a strategy of passwords to try.  It will try dictionary passwords first, cracking "candlestick" in milliseconds.  It will try passwords with all lower-case letters, and passwords with combinations of letters and numbers, and so on.  A proper cracker will be tailored to try weak, predictable passwords first, maximizing the chance of a payoff.
Going off that principle, a password generator can try "candle", "candle.", "candle..", ..., "candle................", and then "candlestick.", "candlestick..", "candlestick...", ..., "candlestick................." far earlier than it could try "ajvlbVP6."  It can try all these passwords before it gets to my random 8-character password because while these passwords are longer, they're predictable and there are far fewer of them than properly-chosen, "more random" passwords.
For the same reason, putting leet speak in your "pa55w0rds" is also a fool's errand; it's a simple matter to try these substitutions in a password as well.  People put numbers in their passwords in this manner for the same reason that  post-WWII Melanesian islanders had performed mock parade drills with wooden rifles, carved headphones out of wood and sat in fake control towers, lit signal fires and torches to light up runways and lighthouses, all in an effort to conjure up gifts of military cargo after military involvement was long gone in the area.  It's [cargo-cult thinking]( which is dangerous thinking, and it demonstrates a lack of understanding of why you would put numbers in your password in the first place.

p.s. here's your two-line loop:
    for pad_char in ('.', '_', '-', '=', '+', '/', '\\', '?', '!', (etc.)):
        for length in xrange (1, 21):
            try_password (prefix + pad_char * length)

I had a very similar experience with them a couple of years ago.  Between fees and lost balances (balances in intermediary currencies below magic thresholds making them too small to do anything with, on the order of $1 to 5 total), there was quite a markup to them.  I think all of the restrictions and overheads were undisclosed at the time.

That counts as hacking as much as finding unencrypted backups of Bitcoin wallets, which is what happened to Bitfloor.

Correct.  I've had a good, quick-turnaround time experience with this.

Bitcoin only has value because people own it and trade with it now, and know that will continue to be so.  The information doesn't have intrinsic value.

Yes, but to be clear BitMe was an exchange.  Your point still stands of course.

You'll seriously luck out if you manage to recover this one.  If it was a not-horrible passphrase, you'd never recover it, no matter how much computational power you threw at it, no matter how much time spent trying different tools and different possible variations of what you think you know of the passphrase.


Then deposit $1.23 in your BitMe account and go to town.  =)

At that rate (literally), why are they bothering with a pool?

Pedantically correct, but not in a way anyone but nerds will care about.  Colloquially when people say EST, CST, MST, or PST, they usually really mean ET, CT, MT, or PT, probably because people don't understand what the S in those terms mean.  On April 11 2013 the US east coast will be observing EDT, so ET = EDT for that point in time, and 2013-04-12 02:00 UTC = 2013-04-11 22:00 EDT = 10pm EDT.

To chase down fraud.
To get an idea of what can be inferred of their own transactions (because surely there are more advanced tools being developed that are operated a bit more privately).

Just discovered that it came in yesterday (2013-08-12) for exactly the expected amount.  I was worried at first that it would be delayed for me, because for the longest time I wasn't able to even submit the refund request (until 2013-07-30 the form was broken for me).

Last I heard (and I don't use Java), Java applets have a security model where you grant permissions for certain things.  A Java applet in of itself *in principle* shouldn't have the capability to log keystrokes or access local files or do anything else that could steal your BTC, but if Java prompts you to grand extended permissions to the applet and you say yes, then you're exposing yourself to risk.  Another avenue would be if there is in fact a Java exploit which allows the applet some access outside of the prescribed sandbox, and I think many of those have come up in the past.

You and everyone else seem to be missing the point: that this (supposedly) wasn't disclosed up front.  Either it was disclosed up front that these docs are required, making OP a liar, or it wasn't one of the original conditions, and you and the other VirWox apologists are avoiding that question and affirming that it's a-okay to pile on new conditions after money has changed hands.

That could be seen as "structuring" your transactions to evade anti-money laundering reporting requirements, which is illegal and more likely to be a red flag than just the original transfer.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:33:48
Very *weird*.  Doesn't sit well with me.  This kind of thing has the potential to create the impression of a conflict of interest situation.  "Journalist paid hundreds of dollars in Bitcoin forum prior to writing a favorable article about the currency."  But she always has the option to donate that amount to charity of her choice.  Or simply "tipping" it back to sender, in public.

Still getting Internal Server Error and no reply to my e-mail on the matter.  I'll have to give it another two months before some volunteer like AudenX might fan some collective fire under Roman's ass.

Last e-mail I got from Bitfloor was dated 2013-04-17:






Nothing on the shutdown, nothing on the CapitalOne nonsense, nothing on the beginning of a new refunds process.  Zero proactive customer communication for this crisis.

What's illegal about it, provided you file the paperwork to report each transaction?  This should be Shtylman's job for a week.  The Secret Service deals in currency counterfeiting.
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:25:28
Money laundering is when you obscure details of the transfer, like the source, recipient, amount, or its very existence at all.  Clearly the transfer wasn't hidden if we're talking about it.

The whole point of Bitcoin is different things to different people.  I wouldn't say it's anonymity, I'd say it's decentralization and the fact you don't need to ask anyone's permission or turn over your identification to start using it.
What this site does is offer a view into information that's always been public and will always be public--there just haven't been good tools to interpret and digest that data.  (Actually I didn't have much luck with this site, but this applies generally to anything like this.)
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:30:20
Of course GRC would suggest such a thing.

As do I.  I tried logging out (which got the same internal server error) and logging back in again.

Bitcoin is secured by its reference implementation, and by ECDSA and SHA256 (and the specific software libraries implementing those algorithms that Bitcoin is using).  The numbers are probably right but the conclusion is BS.  SHA256 is not mathematically proven.  Crypto algorithms sometimes get broken--look at MD5.  Pretty safe, yes.  Laws of the universe?  Undetermined.

In English, Bitme is an exchange that, as Bitfloor used to do, offers free cash deposits at Wells Fargo locations.  Unlike Bitfloor, they charge something like $2 for ACH withdrawals to go the other way around.

I've been watching and in a few minutes it went from 8 to 2 minutes.  
Also about this time is when I see the price recovering.  MtGox really needs to get their act together before they play accessory the next crash (again, IIRC).

I'll bet ZigGap reported you as fraudulent without recognizing that you wouldn't understand the harm.  (ZigGap would need to reject any non-cash payment to shield themselves from chargebacks.  They may have just assumed you were planning on doing a chargeback after getting your Bitcoin since you didn't follow the normal cash procedure.)
