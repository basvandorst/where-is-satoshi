you summed up everything quite nicely.

he is a nocoiner and a alt-tard. if he cant short bitcoin or ride out a alt pump in time, crypto means nothing to him.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:25:46
This is a community page, not a business. You don't want to end up like bitcoin.com. Shit design. 
Including a price ticker pulls .org ever more closer to the minuscule difference between bitcoin and bcash in the newcomers.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:12:39
What's the point on the article then? Imagine if a scam wallet was top 10, would the author even remove it?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:58:23
You are clearly a sock puppet account. To scared to post here with your real account. You clearly don't understand how consensus works. I suggest you research a bit more, than misinforming everyone here.

That is true for much bigger blocks. Risk is minuscule for 1MB blocks.

I hate to say it, there are no alternatives. Any other crypto pretending to offer "higher" tx counts, will really suffer later on. 
What's happening now is we are foregoing short term scaling for long term. Nothing is holding you back from using alts, which devs have chosen short term scaling.
Any p2p software does not scale well, theres been numerous research papers done on why. Scaling doesn't have an easy answer, it's non-trivial. We are currently faced with exponential growth, and alts are currently choosing a linear scaling solution. You know how that will work out in the future.
Also I don't understand why I got down voted. All I was stating was that the amount of votes were manipulated. 3k votes in 1 hour after an unverified article appears? Barely happens on this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:32:44
You exactly right. Why don't we call ripple bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:01:11
This is clearly vote manipulated, for obvious reasons and by obvious parties.

It's over, pack it up. Only satanic worshipers, pornographers, hackers and pedophiles use bitcoin.

It costs almost nothing to include transactions. They are losing out revenue by excluding transactions. They couldn't be anymore dumber tbh. This company really needs to die, its becoming the bane of bitcoin's existence.  
They are deliberately trying to set up a fee market.

cnbc is fake news and fuddsters. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:39:58
Go look at their site. They have 1 good article, then plaster 5 bcash/anti-bitcoin articles on the side.
It's not about the truth here. It's about the intention. Also there's multiple news sites with the same lightning article. 
If you can't see the trap, then idk. God have mercy on you.

You solved scaling well done.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:42:49
My thinking is that it tries to reflect a real-world network. You have nodes/hubs that are active, but aren't doing anything within the network at the given time. Aka theres 10 million online users. Only 500,000 transactions coming from active users on the network given any random time frame.

EDA needs to be synced across all nodes, due to the nature of the consensus rule. Soft-fork will allow a opt-in position, where some nodes will trigger a EDA whilst others won't. Thus causing orphan blocks or even worse, a split.

He will get downvoted rightfully, because it's a trash comment. You can't pick your coffee with a contactless card, can you now? The real criticism is to do with the dispenser/idea.
@_date: 2019-10-16 09:12:10
Funny how you specified just "coffee", is there no other choice? Choice is complexity to any system.
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:03:15
Is your card able to process and encrypt payment details for your bank? If not, that's an extremely insecure "security" model.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:33:35
Everything has a risk. Even 1 conf is a risk, that's why its suggested to wait for 6 confirmations. It all depends on the risk/reward ratio of the shop, given that the transactions are much smaller than ones online. I doubt anyone will care to double spend a 10-20 dollar in store transaction.
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:32:33
Lol try avoiding MITM and card details stolen from sketchy vendors. Also phones do have NFC, enabling that is even easier.

Best opsec is to not let anyone know your strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:29:36
This is probably the biggest cause of high fees. Since everyone is rushing to get their transactions in, wallets add about 10% more fees in order to secure that transaction. Which causes a chain reaction.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:31
So bitcoin's success can be pinpoint on a single exchange? They are a product of bitcoin not the other way around.

Ease of use of getting bitcoin: 5/10. AML &amp; KYC will always destroy ease of use for new comers.
Ease of using of using bitcoin: 10/10. IMHO its safer and faster than using a credit card. In best case.
3/10 for worst case

Ok well, even worse. If he is unable to memorise the private key of a wallet, how is he able to memorise the pgp private key? Does he store that in ciphertext in another chip? Seems like loop of redundancy and ill-logic to seem like the cool-guy of "biohacking".

That's not the issue here, the trash ICOs will pull down the good ones regardless. China banned all ICOs not a select few. Unlike bitcoin which avoids this issue extremely easily, ICOs are done in china.

But this time it will work due to centralised development teams. The weakest point of ICOs, and that most of them are scams.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:52:39
Their fee estimation is a scam. Charged 200 sat/byte when 4 sat/byte got into the same block.
They pass on the fees to the customer for reconciling their own utxo.
Also before people start celebrating this news. Luno is part of barry's DCG and you can guess already, they signed the NYA agreement.

If you concerned about security. You can use a docker with it to set up a daemon only service. You can find some repos on docker and github for it.
2) Adding more than one connection in the same location won't add quality to the network. The best would be to set up around, different providers, different hardware and different location. Eliminates the probability of all nodes becoming compromised.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:08:53
kekw he doesnt know
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:41:44
Yes sure. We should set up a multisig with this single wallet. We can do a 2 of 1 sig. Just to make sure we can't steal each others funds. How does that sound?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:38:14
This is something else. They make their money by charging a service fee of X% on valve's side. As a consumer you shouldn't worry at all about that.
