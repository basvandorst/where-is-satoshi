Don't think so,if i fail with Circle,so everyone knowing will fail too? 
Seems unfair.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:03:36
Good idea,will try to do some researhes
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:01:44
Nothing. Do you think that discussing problems of one of this service will promote the other one? Most bitcoiners have accounts with both services. Anyway it was not intentional
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:39:10
When did you register?
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:02:48
That i was actually i was thinking about. I doubt my C rating(above 550) isn't enough for them. I don't know what was the rating of my gf,but still can be true.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:19:24
Wow, don't want to say US law is bad,but seems there is more freedom in Australia=)
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:29:59
Doubt it. They have all the data they need to prove it was a real person,not the fraudster,but it can take some time to do.

Thank you for the information. Really strange,i thought it was like if delivered and the item is in proper condition than you can't get money back.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:15:01
I'm really sorry for this. I will delete the post when it will be clear why did locked me out of the service,i promise.
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:31:16
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:10:25
The most possible reason for this
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:09:31
IMO It's not about me,it's about us,the community.
I barely imagine a regular newcomer to come buy bitcoin in person. It is taking too much time and makes user feel uncomfortable and to abandon the whole idea of bitcoin. That is why such services appeared.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:39:50
Nothing as of now. I was told someone will get in touch with me soon. Still waiting.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:40:28
Not possible,both credit card and circle account have my full legal name.
I don't think the lock is due some ID error.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:56:56
If the chargeback thing is so easy they should not have launched their service. What did they expect?
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:09:58
Oh. That's perfect.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:28:33
See PM

I was thinking that the problem was in my office network and it was like second try. Uppon telling as story to a friend of mine he was saying that can't be true. He is using same service(CB) like 2 years and there was no problems with identity theft or anything like this. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:16:12
Yes,Florida here
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:24:27
At this point it think they do have a userbase(like people with some successful transactions) and will be closed anyone new trying to buy some bitcoins and i'ts absolutely not as it should be.
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:30:59
I've got C rating,if they used credit check then they have violated US law,buy not disclosing the reason why wasn't i provided the service
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:09:21
I didn't have an account before. Seems strange,but true.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:26:34
They should do some manual researches if their system marked me as a possible fraudster. But as of now,they are blocking everyone their system found suspicious. Let's imagine i need some bitcoins immediately and i'm the place where the public network is available, i make an account,add my credit card(i don't care that 2.9% fee if i'm in hurry) and i make my buy. Circle fraud filters and that ID asking are making the idea of free and instant bitcoins almost a dream.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:38:54
I've tried to resolve the issue,but they have said no.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:54:47
But they should have told me the exact reason. I didn't move like 3 years,but anyway they should have told me the exact reason. There should plenty of ways to confirm my address and identity.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:11:10
How did you add a credit card without entering any personal data?
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:05:43
I have received a very interesting answer upon asking to delete my account.
Due to AML/KYC regulations and their policies they cannot delete the info. That's all
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:04:09
I'm not the invite one member
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:17:08
Seems they don't care much about this(AML and so on),but still thanks for the opinion. This will be nice way for me to make them disclose everything.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:18:31
That is exactly what i think. If they asked for some more information i think i would give it to them.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:16:57
Seems you are in the same situation
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:25:00
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:07:01
I am trying to reach their office to make this clear,seems they are not operating yet. Are they EST?
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:13:00
When did you make an account with them? I'm sure it was like when they opened to public.
