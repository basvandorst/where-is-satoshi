Interesting, so you might are really not the hacker after all. In this case I would advise you to keep your identity to yourself if you have not exposed it yet and don't do video. Fungibility is an important attribute of money, but law enforcement thinks otherwise.  
A Reddit account is relatively safe if you are not accessing it over TOR. I would advise you to start using TOR whenever you are talking in your pseudonym.  
  
However I am still not convinced you are not the hacker, so I would make a video call with you if you can trust me I don't expose you identity.

This is a very simplified version of explaining it.  
CoinShuffle IS using CoinJoin, just like JoinMarket or Blockchain.info's SharedCoin. But the peers in CoinShuffle communicating without the help of a central server, while JoinMarket uses IRC to communicate. Don't make me wrong, it's awesome, but introduces different attack factors.  
CoinShuffle still suffers from the main problem of CoinJoin, in the end it does not break the chain, like a centralized mixer, so no it's not completely anonymous.

I gave a [lecture]( in Tokyo. My theory is we can find the fundamental points to improve Bitcoin if we deduct them from the properties of money (scarcity, fungibility, etc...). In my opinion this would be a great model to figure out what to improve. Beware: my English is not perfect.  
  
As an example your points only address the portability property of good money (IMO this is the attribute where usability can fit in).

I would love to see German translation of it, but to tell you the truth I think it would be too much frustration for someone who is not familiar with coding.  
  
Bitcoin is a great motivation for programming though. I never enjoyed programming, before I got familiar with Bitcoin and saw the respect of this community towards developers.  
  
Also I noticed this pattern at many others, furthermore even those people want to get familiar with coding because of Bitcoin, who's life went to a completely different direction.  
  
Might not be a bad idea to teach programming through Bitcoin.

The theory is, if nobody can print more money, the wealth inequality won't grow so rapidly, or at all.

Offline paper wallet generation is safer. The only way to hack that is actually be present in the real world and steal it.  
  
But with the HD mnemonic setup the hacker [has to get the]( (password AND the mnemonic) OR (the password AND the wallet file).

I am not aware of any theory that we can change in core level to provide fungibility that wouldn't break a bunch of other things.  
  
The unwritten roadmap for fungibility:  
0. Right now: centralized mixers/coinjoin  
1. Might be possible right now: coinswap!  
2. Future: confidental transactions  
3. Far future (4-6 years): Monero/Dash/Zerocoin/Mimblewimble sidechains  
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:23:56
CoinShuffle is coinjoin, that's why I did not included.  
I omitted Schnorr Signatures because it is a nice-to-have but it won't have much impact on privacy.  
That being said I missed out the stealth transactions, though it doesn't seem to gain any adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:23:24
Let's let the existing financial system kick the can down the road until we fix fungibility, scaleability and get instant transactions. I refuse to cheer for a crisis before that.
@_date: 2016-08-28 11:08:49
Supply and demand. I think significant manipulation can only go down when people buy not existing bitcoins, for example on mtgox.  
Exchanges can elevate the supply of bitcoins by creating new ones out of thin air, but how do you manipulate the demand?

I remember I read the same on stackoverflow back then. The only reason programmers choose AES256, because it's a bigger number so it feels safer, but in reality it doesn't matter from security point of view, but concerning performance it is slower.

The hacker wouldn't take the risk. If he is not the hacker it does not seem like a bad idea to expose your identity... at first... of course later obviously he would got into trouble.

Back then in university I remember a class what was about how new technologies are typically play out.  
Innovations comes from the US, but they don't achieve mass adoption there, first Europe, then some advanced places of East Asia adopts it. Finally the rest of the world catch up with the US.  
  
Just take a look at coinmap.org, that gives us a rough estimation. Europe is about to take the lead if not already took it from the US. I am curious if Bitcoin will follow that pattern.

I don't think there are intents yet, just ideas, but yes, incorporating into Bitcoin in a protocol level or even as an other layer would require a miraculous realization, like Luke Dashjr had with SegWit.  
  
On the other hand sidechains are coming, just like the winter in Game of Thrones. Slowly, but it will hit hard.

Yes, CoinShuffle is fully decentralized CoinJoin. It should be noted that other CoinJoins are fairly decentralized too, they don't keep private keys, the servers only help the peers find each other.  
As for Schnorr I am very aware of the privacy "advantages" of it. I just don't think they are relevant.  
It is not hard to see why I think so about the multisig, but one could argue the CJ incentive might works out well. But no, CoinJoin is already cheaper than normal txs, but nobody cares.

If you take an advice, don't go down the rabbit hole.  
Let's face it, it's a lot of words here, but it all comes down to "do something cool blockchain stuff".  
I was working in exactly the same position and did a bunch of research what "blockchains" can do, but there are no examples out there. Eris industries, ripple, multichain and others, they are simply not working.  
Although at the time I was not sure it was my own professional failure or the blockchain was way too overhyped, but these days it has became clear not even R3, an all-star private blockchain hype team, with a bunch of money and big bank backing could came up with anything "blockchain" related solution. They have failed to deliver anything blockchain and probably your little "blockchain expert" will be sitting in your office, eating pizza, trading panda, doge and titcoins, because he'll know his job is stupid and it's just a matter of time when you guys realize it, too.

If Shapeshift would've comply with the AML/KYC requirements of Bitlicense by now all of their users personal documents would've been selling on the black market and they would've lost all their credibility, they might even stop operating.
In contrast, now this hack might even made them gain their userbase by emphasizing their good business practices.

Actually we are not exactly sure what coins belongs to Satoshi. There are some we know, but there are some we are just suspecting.  
If he was involved in Bitcoin early as he stated, he can just use some very early coins and claim, "you see, these are very early coins, so I must be Satoshi".  
I probably overspeculating this, though.
@_date: 2016-04-20 14:05:24
Sorry, I meant private blockchains.

I would go with serious. If you look at the 2013 bubble when the price ran up to $1200 and compare the environment to the current one you tend to feel there's gotta be something wrong here.  
There were very few ways to get bitcoins back then. For example there weren't even any Bitcoin ATM. There were only a handful of exchange without estabilished name and generally they were all sucky. There were no decent Bitcoin wallet. Nobody knew about Bitcoin, only a handful of mentions in the mainstream. Probably darknet markets has been improved greatly too since then, etc...  
Also people were buying NOT EXISTING bitcoins on MtGox.  
  
The only thing that was much better back then is the expectations. It felt like we are only a year away from everyone to use Bitcoin.

Ok. Now we can see what a lot of us were suspecting: it's not a competition to Bitcoin.  
  
I can't help but thinking about the question: if this system is successful it will replace a bunch of (powerful) intermediaries.  
If the war agains blockchain will really turn out to be a bloody one this will be the first system to fall, not bitcoin.   R3 is way more direct threat to the estabilishment (sure not close as big as Bitcoin)

That's right, but there is also the "Bitcoin is the revolution against banksters and governmentsers" message, so it really just depends what message they will try to sell to the crowd.  
I hope it won't be the "criminals can hide their money in Bitcoin", rather the "you can protect your money from banks in Bitcoin".

I don't think that would've been his main argument, I think that was just a quick not well thought reaction (although I think his main arguments would been bullshit, too.)  
  
But if we think about that, it wouldn't be foolish to think Bitcoin would disappear in case power goes down (whatever that means). I mean it's digital, so it must be vulnerable for that scenario right?  
Sure we know that's not how Bitcoin works, how our private keys are safe anyway, but how the hell would you figure this insane logic out if you don't have a deeper understanding? I don't think it's fair to blame him for this.

Richochet is probably good for plausability, [similarly to this South Park clip]( You know, they know you did, that transaction, but they "got nothin' on you".  


I am working hard on Tor these days, then I will decide if (1) I roll it out, (2) I look at new research and rebuild a bunch of things and/or (3) put the backend on top of Core.  
My original idea was to build a full block spv wallet, that's more convenient to use, than a full node, yet it turned out nobody can compete with Core's stability and performance, my wallet eats memory and CPU much more, plus Core is planning to roll out a full block SPV mode, too.

Bulletproofs improves upon Confidential Transactions a lot. To the point where it is already practical to deploy it into Bitcoin.

No, utxos are only blocked if DoS attack happens. Regarding outputs, the coordinator cannot block addresses, because they are revealed at later phases in the coinjoin (output registration) at which point the coordinator not accepting something would be a DoS attack on the round.
Btw, there is no reason why would these addresses need to be blocked in the first place. If someone wants to deanonymize themselves its their business. I mean how could you "accidentally"  modify Wasabi's codebase to reuse a single address? That had to be intentional.

Oh, at this point, I didn't think it's debatable, anyhow, let me emphasize the connections again.

2. ~~Developers who work on Samourai worked at Blockchain.info~~ The developer who did 96.45% of the commits to Blockchain.info's Android app is SamouraiDev. The SamouraiWallet account was only the product lead.
3. Also a former Blockchain.info employee has confirmed it.

Your questions are good and I don't have good answers for them. These are one of the reasons why the chances of CT getting into Bitcoin isn't looking good.
There are some ideas on the dev mailing list though, like extension blocks where the vulnerability of extension block doesn't affect the main chain, but arguably these ideas are resulting in too much  technical debt. The third big issue you didn't ask about is quantum.

That sounds about right. The infrastructure they have is a pretty much a one dev job, maybe two. It's a centralized Bitcoin wallet and a trading platform with some inconsistent front end.

Schnorr signatures make coinjoined transactions smaller, so it'll be cheaper to do a zerolink mixing round than do a normal transaction. But Schnorr doesn't add more to privacy, than this small incentive.

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:22:25
It comes from the notion that people who have Bitcoin gains exchanged millions of coins on exit scammed exchanges like Mintpal and Cryptsy, they lost their coins many times and anyway who keeps records of all they are doing in a chaotic finacial wild west?  
It is also important to note that many countries have no clear rules on Bitcoin. For example double taxation only esists in the US. But do you have to pay taxes if you are German, wandering around the World and only using foreign exchanges? Try relaxing one of the restriction and the answer is still not obvious.  
On the other hand Bitcoiners from the US see they are the only ones being cracked down on at this point of time and they feel it's unfair. Why cannot they be as free as Chinese people?

Well, let me try a pseudo calculation that'll show this number is not as high as it initially seems. How many open source, active Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Shell developers did we have during the last two years? Probably a couple of thousands. I took at least 50 hours out of my time dealing with Roger's bullshit directly and another 150 dealing with the propaganda he created. Of course, there definitely are some developers, who didn't take it and were able to keep coding. But there are also people, like Jimmy Song, Eric Lombrozo, Peter Todd, who pretty much stopped being active developers to address the chaos in the space.  
Nevertheless we can count with 100 hours per developers, that'd give us a number of 100,000 hours. And what about the people who never even started to go down the path of Bitcoin development, because they were scared away by the shitshow?

Keep it running until a mix is triggered by one of the following conditions:  
- 100 users registered to the mix.
- 21 users registered to the mix AND the input registration phase timed out, which is currently Dec. 20 (Wednesday), 10 PM London time

If you think Bitcoin's fungibility is a good cause consider supporting the work on [ZeroLink]( We are a few days away from start the public testing.  
ZeroLink's mixing technique is the first massive scale CoinJoin implementation and we also built a dedicated wallet (HiddenWallet) that makes sure privacy loss doesn't happen due to  factors unrelated to the mix. In short, it provides end to end privacy.  
Also we are fully transparent and record every thing the donations are being spent on: 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:57:21




In the world of cross platform programming, it's impossible to prepare for everything without real people hitting the software.  




It is not misleading. Feel free to poke holes:   


Here's how you proceed with HiddenWallet:
1. You have an address with money on it and somebody knows it.  
2. You push it through the mixing.  
3. You make a transaction and don't neglect to accept the recommendations of the "Privacy Improvement Suggestion" dialog, when building the transaction.  
No guesses can be made here.  
Is it a good user experience? No, it's terrible. You must wait until the wallet syncs, you must mix in $1000 rounds. You cannot spend more than $1000 at once, because input joining is not allowed.  
Fully anonymous usage of Bitcoin is enabled.  


I'd say, we are far from convenient fully anonymous usage, but please don't say it's not possible if you didn't look into it.

Make no mistake, privacy is not the passion of Samourai, nor they delivered any.  
I am always struggled by the surreality of the situation when someone mentions Samourai together with JoinMarket and Wasabi.

In fact many of Samourai's privacy enhanching wallet features actually degrade the privacy of the user.

- The coordinator of the mix cannot steal your money, in fact it doesn't even touches, it. It simply helps the users coordinate between themselves.  
- The coordinator of the mix cannot deanonymize you.  
- The tumbling happens with uniform denominations. Therefore it cannot happen that one person tumbles 0.1btc and another one 0.2btc, where blockchain analysis can reestablish the links between inputs and outputs.  
- The scheme comes with a dedicated wallet, that's resistent to network analysis. This is important, because if you are using Electrum, then you are directly asking the Electrum servers "what are the balances of these addresses?" So, you expose that you have these addresses. This general problem is called: private transaction retrieval, which is only solved in full nodes and full block SPV nodes, since they are asking for all the transactions the network has, therefore they don't expose, which transactions they are interested in.  
- A privacy oriented coin control feature is also implemented. This solves various issues, for example: if you are sending some coins to mtgox, and from the change you are buying some alpaca socks from silk road then the alpaca socks purchase would be directly linked to your real identity.

Bear in mind that creating all kinds of strange transactions is not deception in itself, imitation of other existing transaction patterns are. (Notice I used the word "pattern.") The former is detrimental for privacy, even though the design intent is the opposite, so be careful with that.  
And, since we're here, I am also a big fan of your Boltzmann, however I don't think it is production ready in the sense of coding against it. Boltzmann is a great basis for further research.  
Why I think coding against Boltzmann today is a bad idea, because if Boltzmann would start looking at transaction chains instead of singled out transactions, as Blockchain analysis usually do, it would give entirely different results, that instantly obsolates all the system that was built against Boltzmann 1.0.  
I hope I didn't end up sounding too harsh, I support all privacy improvements, I just wanted to provide some constructive feedback.

You are right, It is a question between privacy and blacklisting. For that, I would say the privacy edge matters more than the blacklisting edge. In fact, to my knowledge, today, blacklisting doesn't happen from mixers, only from direct DNM sends, but oh, well that's just an anecdotal evidence, so I guess you are right.  
Btw note, there's a whole set of other issues with other third parties (exchanges and miners) gaining information about the mixing, but let it be out of the scope of this conversation.

I think the "problem" of the blocksize debate is rather that, the development of bitcoin is way too decentralized.  
It's so decentralized they couldn't even come to consensus in a question like this blocksize, what is so minor issue, compared to something like changing the 21mil cap.

If stonewall looks like another CJ transaction then it is good, if it doesn't then it exposes common coin ownership.
Since JoinMarket is the only CoinJoin solution in production that stonewall could imitate, that's the reference. It doesn't only have to look like JM on the transaction level (fees, rbf usage, input-output ordering, script type etc...) it also has to look the same when transaction chains are examined.

Right, the short story is, so far we planned that for the 1.0 Release (October 31,) but just yesterday we encountered some issues those might prevents this.
The long story is, we encountered a problem with OSX: turns out our UX framework, called Avalonia, is completely unusable on that platform. So a month ago we started to rewrite the OSX backend of Avalonia and just yesterday our Avalonia dev, Dan said it will be a bigger work than he initially thought, so I'm not exactly sure what to tell you at this point. I guess being honest is the least bad strategy.

You are talking about the lower layer of the network, but CB and MtGox live on a higher one. A higher layer can be centralized, just like a lower one and yes, it matters.  
  
Look at the internet where one company, youtube has gained monopoly over video streaming. Because of huge pressure on censorship the end result is that we can all forget porn on the most convinient streaming site.  
  
My point is, even if the lower layers of the internet is more decentralized, its application layer, over video streaming is not so much.  
Now apply this to Bitcoin and you will soon see, the network not only on mining level can get corrupted if too much power accumulates.

This'd be quite a guide in 2013, but I'd say, today such a guide is incomplete without mentioning [JoinMarket]( and [Wasabi Wallet,]( due to the [inherent issues with traditional mixers]( which are:
* They can steal your coins.
* They can deanonymize you.
* Other users are using light wallets, which can be easily deanonymized by network analysis, thus hiding in a deanonymized crowd is kinda pointless.
* They get away with unequal amount mixing (the wrong way.)
Also if it is not an advertisement for that specific mixer, I'd advise you to change it to other centralized mixers those are handling unequal amounts correctly, like ChipMixer (there might be more, and I definitely cannot vouch for its legitimacy, only for their way of mixing.) Still the rest of inherent weaknesses are there.

We are very very far from people using bitcoin as a currency get to compete with fees, not even with small transactions. It's all just stupid fear monger hype.  
  
But the other use-cases of Bitcoin gets to suffer, like colored coins, etc... But for me, as a Bitcoin user, it doesn't matter. But for me as a programmer it matters. End users of my blockchain programs shouldn't care about, since I am going to solve this issue, if not with Bitcoin, but with sidechain or whatever we'll have.  
  
Personally, if you point a gun to my head I'd be in the favor of blocksize increase as long as we don't have any working solution in place, if you do the math you'll realize this can't be the ultimate solution anyway and the other side of the debate is fear mongering too.

In BIP37, a client publishes its bloom filters left and right, multiple times, while in BIP157-BIP158 the client fetches one block on demand, only once. This makes the two hardly comparable.  
Furthermore Jonas had was successful establishing wallet clusters with 70% success by combining bc analysis heuristics and crawling for bloom filters. 
This was, because bloom filters tell which addresses are surely not in the wallet. In block fetching there is a false positive rate, so the attacker cannot even figure out if a user surely needs the block he fetches or not.  
As a side note I agree however, that address reuse is just one heuristic, and any other clustering heuristic does it.  
Also I'd like to make sure we are talking about the same thing, since the BIP doesn't recommend anything just says "download from any source" so I assume the most straightforward (easiest) block download solution:
1. Maintain P2P connection to (usually 8) bitcoin nodes.  
2. Whenever a block is needed, choose one randomly or based on latency and download from it.  
Is this what you are assuming, too?


There are multiple problems with that. Generally, in most (if not all?) anonymity systems/mixnets we have some kind of honest node percentage assumption. 
If an attacker still achieves to be the sole source of blockchain information of a light client for an extended period of time, privacy is the least of your worry. Even if it is your biggest worry, then transactions broadcasting is the real issue, not transaction retrieval.  
In the case when the attacker only adds x percentage of your nodes, if a block is fetched from it, it doesn't know if "that is the only block the client needs" or "is it a really a block the client needs." The latter because of the false positives.

Funnier explanation here: 


This issue is a corner case. This issue only stands when the receiver doesn't trust the sender, which is only the case when the receiver is a merchant/exchange/etc...  
In which case the receiver always tells the sender how much to pay. Also if the above doesn't convince you then you can just go one step further and implement a minimum amount to receive check.

This is just a preparing PR. The thing is, from a privacy point of view, all light wallets fail against network analysis, except the recently figured client side filtering concept.  
The idea is that, full nodes will create filters and those filters are sent to the light clients, and, with that, those can figure out which blocks they are interested in, thus establishing the wallet balance without information leak.  
For the record, we already rolled this out on the mainnet with Wasabi wallet, where we built our own backend to download the filters from.

Yesterday we adjusted the fees to anonymity sets. Instead of a constant 0.3% fee per round, we now use 0.003% multiplied by the achieved anonymity set per round. Since we do not have the 100 participants constantly yet, it is fair if we don't take constant 0.3% fees.  
Also since we do not take any fees if the total fee doesn't reach 0.0003BTC, the usage of the software is free now.

Oh, there are some misunderstanding here, because of the deleted comment.  
That comment stated, "igot shouldn't be trusted because its CEO is Zhou Tonge".  
Why did he said that? Well I wasn't around that time, but if someone made a song like this about Zhou Tong, that's not a good sign:   
Then I corrected Zhou Tong is the CEO of coinjar, not igot.  
Anyway, as I heard both coinjar and igot is very highly regulated, just like the JPMorgan Chase criminal gang.

@_date: 2014-12-14 13:38:00
Absulutely, I cannot guarantee that. I'm just saying the possibility that Bitcoin will collapse is lower than the possibility of any other asset collapse out there.  
About the altcoins, personally I think they will have their usecase, but there has to be some reserve currencies (one might argue there only can be one, I don't know) and bitcoin will be one of them, because of the infrastructure that has already been created around it. Just think about how hard to introduce IPv6, because IPv4 is just fine. Ats are incremental improvements and not radical ones. Bitcoin was the radical improvement compared to fiat or gold.

Nah, after reading more I've realized this paper is bullshit. For most of the issues I know the solution without thinking too much. I've just surprised, because the the other paper was surprisingly logical:  
For this issue I've found this solution in a comment on youtube:
"jeroeniskoning3 hours ago (edited)
 
The article is right on most statements.
Though, it ignores the fact many innovations are on the way. For example: technologies like side chains and tree chains will make it possible to make frictionless hops between consensus networks (which digital currencies are). This could solve the "raising transaction costs" problem because not all transactions (small transactions) need the high network power (thus security level) that Bitcoin has.
Imagine buying bread by - on the fly and without any friction - converting btc to for example litecoin with it's weaker network and lower transaction costs. The transaction will be processed by a network that has a costs/security ratio that better fits the value transaction.﻿"

You should rethink the concept.
The process of accomplising includes 5 steps:
0. Need
1. Analyze
2. Vision
3. Alternatives
4. Design the choosen alternative
5. Realize
+. New system
In this case:
0. Need for a better organized way to get the right track this whole "Bitcoin Revolution".
1,2,3. The next step is not to giving away your money, but to find a leader who see the problem and could come up with a solution, a vision (let's call him Steve). So you could organize rather a vision contest, than a developer contest.
4,5. You choose from the alternatives, then hire somebody who has very high mangement skills, who can organize and realize your and Steve's vision.
There are people out there who has visions for "how to change the world with bitcoin", but they lack of money and managment skills.
There are people out there who have good management skills and have the motivation to change the world with bitcoin, but they lack of money and vision.
There are people out there who have de developer skills and have the motivation to participate the Bitcoin Revolution.
So your role could be to provide money, find the leader (vision) and the manager.
I think your main goal is to give every talented people (from bitcoin board) a chance to participate in some way, so they could find their place much more easily in the community. So you would have a condition for the leader is to create a vision while keeping this in mind.

Anyway these lines are not that hard to understand. Okay, let's say I can't read code, in this case I can trust the code was already reviewed a thousand times by other developers. If I still think it might be malicious I still have the possibility to use a traditional way (Coinbase or Circle) to store my keys. For a traditional asset you can only have the last option.

For attacks like that the stars must align well:)

- Third, you also assume, an attacker can make sure the target fetches blocks from him and only from him. This is quite unrealistic, for this you must be an ISP or something.

It is a double-edged sword. It also makes much harder to do phishing.  
Bitcoin book:  
"Vanity addresses can be used to enhance and to defeat security measures, they are truly a double-edged sword. Used to improve security, a distinctive address makes it harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your customers into paying them instead of you. Unfortunately, vanity addresses also make it possible for anyone to create an address that resembles any random address, or even another vanity address, thereby fooling your customers."

It's every 24h since the last mix. Which I cannot give you time, because I am restarting the backend from time to time to update it, which also resets the timer. If it turns out we won't reach 100 peers constant, I'll implement a more sophisticated way of showing how much time is left before a mix is forcefully triggered.

You don't need much consensus if SegWit is useful for a small set of applications those can tolerate long confirmation times.  
You only need one mining pool and one application that requires malleability fix, but doesn't require fast confirmation to get things started.

OKCoin stopped paying to Roger Ver, despite they have a contract.  
Roger went to public and the public digged up a bunch of other things about OKCoin, for example:  
-they faked a contract  
-they don't pay to other people, too, like CZ  
-they are faking their volume  
-only the ceo and his family has access to the coldstorages  
-they faked the audit about their reserves  
-they're acting like psychopaths (okay, this is not an objective fact, but whoever read their mailing with Roger, he'll come to the same conclusion, like a random reddit guy said: "I don't know shit about anything and it's obvious to even me that those OK coin guys are shady."  
  
Now they're trying to blame their past CTO, CZ that he forged the contract. They have even hacked his QQ account.  
  
TLDR: They are insolvent.

I think this survey is a great idea, but I'm afraid this is not the right form.  
What I mean by that:  
1. First question: "Should the blockchain size be increased?"  
I think yes it should, but not according to Gavin's proposal, however, I was afraid there will be no other question, so I was considering answering "No". I did answer yes and there were other questions. Others might fall for this.  
2. How much should it be increased? 5MB is the smallest amount you can choose. I'd go with 2MB.  
3. When you show the results, it might be misleading for some who don't realize that Gavin's proposal is not supported by 25% of the community, because that diagram excludes the people who answered no. So Gavin's proposal is supported about 15-20% of the community.  
  
Anyway, those are my thoughts, I think those are the things why you get the downvotes in reddit.

On the metro system math, not on a single station:  
  
[Daily ridership]( in Tokyo Metro is 6,307,390 people. That's 6307390/24/60/60 = 73 passengers per second.  
73 transactions per second would be around 10mb.  
I did not mention in Tokyo there are more companies operating subway systems, not only "Tokyo Metro".  
Of course the per second calculation I made did not exclude the hours when Tokyo Metro doesn't operate, so the traffic is more concentrated.  
And the passangers are not distributed equally through the operating times, let alone the days of the week or the months of the year.  
Because of this a blockchain like this should handle the busiest hours in the busiest days in the busiest months, since you cannot tell the customers going through the gates to wait until blocks free up.  
  
If a system like this would have 100 times more customers in its busiest second, than the average second that'd be 1GB.

The relation is indeed weak. You'll hear a lot the higher the price the more miners come. But that theory proved to be only partly true.

The idea of OpenBazaar is from the time when people thought the most complicated concept will revolutionize how DNM works. Now it seems like to add little value to it, because there are simpler ways to do it. Do not also forget they took a bunch of investment so they will not market themselves in the dark corners of the internet. It would look strange if they'd start spamming onion forums to get customers. IMO they are more likely to keep targeting grey, than dark markets, what is not less exciting, because there might be a huge market gap.

Not sure about 2MB limit. That feels right for me, but I trust core is smarter than me so I won't revolt until my btc txs confirm in 10min under 0.1-0.3usd fee.  
The 75pc looks too small to me, too but again, I trust core is smarter than me to make the decision.  
  
What bugs me are some people involved in classic and this is proven by their aggressive marketing spreading of misinformation, the personal attacks on core, their scammy list of who supports them and the list goes on.

It's not simply a web blockchain explorer. It's an HTTP API, it is used to make transactions on the backend, checking the balance and stuff. For example in joinmarket.  
In that particular case, those people who doesn't have a full-node connected to joinmarket (so like 90% of its userbase), for them joinmarket doesn't work at all for 24 hours now.  
  
I wonder what other services are failing because of this.

@_date: 2016-03-20 16:21:29
Because I noticed it now.  
When I go to their site the last block is this one:  
Block height: 403390 (while at this moment the real block height is 403519, so it's pretty behind)  
Block created: 20 hours 30 minutes ago  
  
Also I sent a transaction to my joinmarket wallet, that's configured to use blockr.io API.  
The wallet doesn't sync, blockchain.info's explorer shows 10conf, blockr.io's not even an unconfirmed tx.  
  
So you say it is at just me?

TLDR: Bitcoin companies using the Blockchain in a very inefficient way and it is not likely to change, because of human behaviour.  
  
I am missing the point why Armstrong has more to do with it than any other company in space. 
  
If we narrow the conversation to Coinbase, what it can improve is to make 1 transaction per 10 (or 20 or whatever coinjoin transaction number is reasonable) withdrawal instead of the current 2 transaction per 1 withdrawal.  
Ironically if CB would optimize their blockchain usage would weaken their stance on the blocksize debate. So I wouldn't bet they'll consider your suggestion even for a second. (Though I would love to be proven wrong.)

I am getting more optimistic on the issue. I need to do much more research to be sure about what I will say here, but I am suspecting SegWit will activate one way or another, regardless what miners signal.  
It seems like we might can activate segwit for only a small set of people and that would get things started.  
A basic example would be one mining pool that starts mining segwit blocks and one application, that needs malleability fix and can tolerate long confirmation times.  
Some mining pools couldn't afford to miss out the plus fees, coming from segwit transactions are cramed into a few blocks a day so they would switch too. This would result faster confirmation times for segwit transactions, which would enable more applications to use segwit. This could result more mining pool switching and so on...  
  
Meanwhile antpool keeps mining empty blocks as always.

At first I wanted to just write a completely dismissive comment about how big bullshit what you just wrote, but then I realized it is actually very true: if there is no ceiling there is no fud, if there is no fud the price would be higher.  
Imagine what will happen when people realize that ceiling is not a ceiling, just a fud line.  
Either we elevate it or break it with other methods, like segwit, lighting, thunder, thin blocks, coinjoin, centralized services and so on all improve the transactions / minute, and these makes that ceiling just a fud line.
@_date: 2016-03-22 13:55:43
Indeed, but this is the best we have today and it can give us some suspicion, not conclusion.

@_date: 2015-05-18 14:35:55
"They didn't have any idea what bitcoin is, they just wanted to buy some." - about the last rally.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:09:11
Sure:   
It is somewhere around the beginning. (The livestram still going on.)
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:40:05
You misunderstand me, I am not talking about CoinJoin (CJ) in general. I am talking about JoinMarket(JM), a specific implementation of CJ.  
  
The problem with CJ is that if 3 party joins their transaction (tx)together, but the tx amounts are different then we can tell who sent where.  
  
My understanding on Confidental Transaction (CT) is that is masks the amount being sent, so we suddenly cannot tell who sent where in our CJ example.  
This is how CT + CJ is complementary.  
  
Without CT, people had to find ways how to solve the problem above. An obvious solution is to make every tx input and output the same amount somehow in CJ.  
The straightforward solution is to get a wallet what has a huge liquidity and make every transaction CJ transaction with the same amount. Obviously this is not something that can be done in practice.  
  
So that's when JM came and it said. Let's get a few people and call them makers. They will just sit around with their coins and wait for other people, called takers to come and for a small fee buy their liquidity. So when a taker comes and wants to send 3btc to an other address with equal amount CJ tx he asks a few makers for a fee to join their tx together with him and use the same amount.  
  
This is why I think JM and CT is not complementary.  
Is my reasoning right?
  
@_date: 2016-01-06 09:42:08
Of course they do. Who'd see that coming.
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:53:14
Not necessarily.  
If you want to buy some bitcoins and your exchange / BitcoinATM uses blockr.io's API, transactions won't happen and the Bitcoins will never reach your full node.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:32:17

@_date: 2016-03-22 13:50:19
It is hard to make this kind of conclusions out of such a small survey, but it's far the best we have today, so I would rather use the word suspicion, instead of conclusion.  
  
One thing I would note: It says "small blockers rather see Bitcoin as a settlement system."  
I think this gives the bad idea.  
If he means, small blockers see bitcoin as a settlement system, that can be correct if we think about bitcoin what we know today, the main chain, but not bitcoin the currency. Not bitcoin with lighting, thunder, idechains, etc...  
Small blockers (I don't know why, but I hate this word) just think, if we would put everything on the main chain bitcoin wouldn't even be able to serve a city's daily transaction need with several GB blocksize. So technically it might be correct to say, "yeah, small blockers want settlement system", but it leads to huge misunderstandings and fights.
@_date: 2016-03-26 21:02:36
Is the chart looks similar with the proper formula? 
@_date: 2016-03-26 17:09:01
Apply the chart to an irrelevantly small timeframe, but at least at least it's small enough to prove your point. You must be a writer on ZeroHedge.
@_date: 2016-03-11 18:17:28
I mean if 100 ppl join their tx together (probably cant there must be a limit for this) Then the attacker has 1% chance to guess the right combination. If you do an other round with 100 people the attacker has 0.01% chance.  
  
This is the only gain I can think of but there might be more.
@_date: 2016-03-30 20:16:37
Not sure other commenters think that but, if so it's pretty foolish. I mean seriously? If anything it will be a instant one shot crash, when the expectations because of the instant one shot rally don't match reality.  
If I would be someone who wants to buy Bitcoin and thinks there will be an instant one shot rally, I would definitely buy it before the halving so I would make money quickly.  
If I would be someone who wants to buy Bitcoin but don't think there is an instant one shot rally (or just don't know about it at all), the time of halving wouldn't affect my decision of when to buy Bitcoin.  
This 2 usecase shows us there is no-one who would time their Bitcoin buy after halving.  
  
The only usecase I can think of if sameone speculates on the expectations of people not getting the instant rally and thinks there will be a crash and wants to buy up the bottom.  
I have a feeling not too many people would dare to overspeculate on this scenario, but I can be wrong.

of never making any cryptographically secure signatures to link together
his posts - or indeed any communication at all - fits well with the
avoidance of creating a central authority figure. Currently every single
thing Satoshi ever apparently wrote can only be linked together by
trusting third parties - email archives could have been hacked,
bitcointalk might have fake messages, etc.

I am not sure how Electrum works, but I suspect it is functioning for as a watch only wallet, so he has the seed extended public key, but not the seed extended private key. If so his story adds up up to this point. The bad news is it cannot be recovered.  
  
His best chance is to get his old phone number back, which in theory shouldn't be a problem, just have to push the phone company a little. Because he didn't mention he tried it, which would be the obvious thing to do, before offering any bounty. This is where I am suspecting there is something funky going on.  
Furthermore, OP's username is also a sign of being involved in "funky things".  
  
**Conclusion: OP's only chance is to push the phone company to get his old number back. If OP is not the rightful owner, it is unlikely he'll successfully social engineer the phone company to steal the coins. You'd have to be a professional con-artist, like Craig Wright for that:)**

I mentioned Ethereum has a great potential, but since it is not used for anything I suspect the timing of those ideas is too early.  
But as I said if sidechains don't happen before those ideas take off then Bitcoin might gets into trouble in competing those "exotic" use cases.  
   
Also note I was examining the topic from storing value point of view. I was also working in a blockchain research group back then and we did not find any exotic use case that do require the underlying ledger to hold value, these use cases are all about storing or proving something, not transferring value. I do suspect there must be some, I did not encounter any yet.

Well, restricting amounts to specific sizes in order to make matches easier doesn't help for JM, since they have solved it in other way. However I believe would've been a solution on the foundamental CJ problem, too, wonder if someone has worked on it.  
  
Here is my concern: usually CJ implementations chain together CJ transactions to make it more difficult to guess. Now how do you chain If everyone sends 1BTC+fee then the next tx would require the fee again and if the lower level is 0.75BTC, then it will join together 0.75BTCs +fees, because the amount came out from previous CJ is 1BTC and with 1BTC you cannot do your next CJ transactio to be chained together with 1BTC txs, because you couldn't pay fee.  
I might overexplained it a bit:)

Not overlap, I go hardcore and downloading full blocks and smartly store only the relevant transactions and calculate stuff from them, with this I make sure I do not make any privacy compromissum to Core. It comes with some inconvinience, because of downloading the full blocks, but probably manageble.

Well, they are just hosting it, couldn't really do any nasty things with it, the miners would simply change pool.  
However the miner centralization trend is worrisome and it is way more centralized than it was before. The problem will be very real when the 4 biggest miner gets the 75 or something % hashrate.  
I think Bobby Lee's thinking is kindof affected by some Chinese pride, I'm not sure he would've come to this (utterly wrong) conclusion if the centralization would've been happening in, let's say France.

It might seem like that in the first glance, but Bitcoin works differently. **In Bitcoin you don't have the privacy that you are used to in the traditional financial system.**  
Today only Blockchain surveillance companies can make proper conclusions about addresses, transactions and transaction chains, but their industry is rapidly evolving and if we don't improve Bitcoin's fungibility we are going to find ourselves in a world when our psycho ex wives and husbands are going to know everything about us through our finances.

If Bitcoin only succeeds as a payment network then that vision can be right, but if it succeeds as a currency too, it becomes a stable unit of value, it will slowly raise, because of the limited supply. People will have to be really stupid to store their wealth in a currency that loses value over time. It's really a no brainer.

Actually there is BitcoinEC that aims to build BU's EC on top of Core.

Hi guys, I am one of the developer behind the project. I would like to share some comments on this.  
  
I am working on TumbleBit, a trustless Bitcoin mixer, where not even the Tumbler can deanonymize you. I am not positive about it can solve any scaleability issues, but that's an other topic. At TumbleBit we have a couple of useability issues, like you have to use Bitcoin Core, you have to have a different output wallet, you have to do everything with terminal, etc, and nobody can work on it full time, since we are not getting payed for it.  
  
To sum up: we could use a little more man-power. I had the idea of contacting Stratis if they can lend us some. Stratis is working on a Bitcoin full-node in the same language TumbleBit is written, so they have a competent developer team.  
What they gain for it is marketing. An altcoin provides a Bitcoin wallet is a great marketing opportunity. We can outsource to them the GUI development, marketing, some code review and some testing. It's a win-win. Background story finished.  
  
About the wallet:  
We are planning 4 stages at the moment (at least me):  
1. Full-block SPV wallet.  
2. TumbleBit integration.  
3. Add Stratis wallet.  
4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange, based on TumbleBit.  
  
**1. Full-block SPV wallet**  
I [went to great lengths]( to figure out what is the lightest way to preserve privacy when retrieving information from the blockchain. And my conclusion was: today if you are not usin Bitcoin Core, then all your addresses are linked together by various third parties. Since Bitcoin Core receives all the information the Bitcoin network has, therefore nobody can figure out what information your wallet is intereted in.  
This can be achieved in a lighter way, by building a full-block SPV wallet, what downloads blocks from the creation of the wallet, notes the transaction it is interested in and throws away the rest (or something like this). Bitcoin Core is also working on a wallet like this.  
Therefore if privacy is crucial for you and Core or us came out with our full-spv wallet you might consider changing, even if you are not interested in using TumbleBit.  
  
**2. TumbleBit integration**  
We are going to integrate TumbleBit Classic Tumbler mode. 
  
**3. Add Stratis wallet**  
I cannot comment on this. We don't accept money from Stratis, therefore we are not going to concentrate on it. The development of this part is entirely up to them.  
  
**4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange**  
This is a very interesting topic. In theory you could exchange different coins with TumbleBit, just like you are exchanging bitcoins (mixing). We'll see how this topic will evolve, not a priority right now.

@_date: 2017-03-13 04:51:57
Great questions. No, yes, yes.  
  
TumbleBit does not depend on SegWit. That being said, if it activates, we probably wrap up everything and start building a new, way more superior system.

We were very close to a hard fork there due to SPV mining...  
  
But yes, Core nodes will reject them, and since the vast majority of wallets, block explorers, everything is running Core they will fork themselves out. The number of BU nodes are controlled by a very few people, they are only for the show.  
  
To sum up: , yes you are correct.

Why so many people close their eyes when it comes to the darknet, the only place where Bitcoin is used. Yes the darknet slowly started to move away from Bitcoin and fees are partly a reason for that. The question is if we can stop this before other alts reach the tipping point. The race is on.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:47:08
Not very optimistic. Last time I checked, 3 days ago, they were short on devs and seemed to think BU didn't implement SegWit, because it is too hard and simple copypaste doesn't work. This would actually explain the rhetoric. Remember, everyone was for SegWit not so long ago?

@_date: 2017-03-06 10:02:21


  
I understand where you are coming from but that's a terrible way to put it.  
When you realize the blockchain should grow 1TB per day in order to compete only with Visa then, considering this context **blocksize increase is the perfect example of kicking the can down the road**. Which I personally believe is acceptable compromise. However many are not as flexible as me and without them agreeing I won't agree in a hard fork either. So I find myself on the sides of those who don't want any increase, because I don't want to risk all my life savings on this.  
  
Considering, at this point of time we have no other options but to roll out LN and segwit it is a shame some poeple are running a desperate campaign against them, because they got their feelings hurt.

It is bad for you in the sort term. Fees go down and second layer solution will prevent fees to grow too fast.  
On the other hand not having segwit might be catastrophic in the long term, because someone else will. And someone else will have second layer solution based on segwit and Bitcoin would have a hard time to overcompete that altcoin. Since Bitcoin failing to evolve is bad for all of us, maybe even catstrophic I would not want to figure out what happens then if I were you.  
  
Consider this evil analogy:  
If you have supermarket and a street vendor is selling some drinks next to you what do you do? You lower the prices of your drink, you won't even be profitable, but it will be good for you in the long term because the street vendor have to shut down the business.

Well, if you want to bring it to philosophical path then consider how well that did work out? Nobody can run a full-node anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if I'd be the last person who uses Core as a daily wallet. Not fun waiting half an hour every time you fire up.  
Similarly the US is heading towards a catastrophy for constantly increasing the debt ceiling. We can do better.

What he is selling is that "Core wants the fees go high" and failing to admit fees are going up, because actual solutions are being delayed by his propaganda.  
**Of course nobody wants high fees, that is crazy talk.**  
When people say they are ok with high fees, that actually means they are more ok with high fees, than a centralized Bitcoin.  
  
The thing is Bitcoin can barely handle a bigger city's metro system with 1GB blocks. Fees will get high sooner or later. Block size increase will not happen in a divided community.

I am getting more optimistic on the issue. Looks like SegWit will activate one way or another, regardless what miners signal.  
It seems like we might can activate segwit for only a small set of people and that would get things started.  
A basic example would be one mining pool that starts mining segwit blocks and one application, that needs malleability fix and can tolerate long confirmation times.  
Some mining pools couldn't afford to miss out the plus fees, coming from segwit transactions are cramed into a few blocks a day so they would switch too. This would result faster confirmation times for segwit transactions, which would enable more applications to use segwit. This could result more mining pool switching and so on...  
  
Meanwhile antpool keeps mining empty blocks as always.

2032 1GB blocks at Visa level. How incompetent (or manipulative) do you have to be to come up with that number? [We need 2GB blocksize only just to handle the average volume in 2017]( but we don't need to handle the average volume, but the maximum, which at Christmas could go probably up to 10-100-1000 times higher, pick a multiplier randomly, I pick the smallest.  
So we are at 20GB blocksize in 2017. In the same calculation it seems like Visa's volume double in every 3 years, that means **by 2032 we need 160GB blocksize AT BEST** just to compete with Visa.

I don't think it matters at this point, but it's certainly a plausible attack vector, which is easy to fix by using Tor Browser. In fact Blockstream's block explorer just added an onion site: [
In fact Wasabi's onion site shows this as the recommended block explorer now because of this: [
Another related plausible issue is when you keep googling "100 USD to BTC" when you want to send money. Here they can associate your transaction to the amount, but I guess you already use Wasabi's built in exchange rate, so that should be fine.

@_date: 2017-03-12 12:48:18
Hi guys, I am one of the developers behind Breeze Wallet, and also Chief Redditor of TumbleBit:) I would like to share some comments on this.  
  
I am working on TumbleBit, a trustless Bitcoin mixer, where not even the Tumbler can deanonymize you. I am not positive as to whether it can solve any scaleability issues, but that's an other topic. At TumbleBit, we have a couple of useability issues like you have to use Bitcoin Core, you have to have a different output wallet, you have to do everything with a terminal etc., and nobody can work on it full time since we are not getting paid for it.  
  
To sum up: we could use a little more man-power. I had the idea of contacting Stratis if they can lend us some. Stratis is working on a Bitcoin full-node in the same language TumbleBit is written, so they have a competent developer team.  
What they gain for it is marketing. An altcoin providing a Bitcoin wallet is a great marketing opportunity. We can outsource to them the GUI development, marketing, some code review and some testing. It's a win-win. Background story finished.  
  
About the wallet:  
We are planning 4 stages at the moment (at least me):  
1. Full-block SPV wallet.  
2. TumbleBit integration.  
3. Add Stratis wallet.  
4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange, based on TumbleBit.  
  
**1. Full-block SPV wallet**  
I [went to great lengths]( to figure out what is the lightest way to preserve maximal privacy when retrieving information from the blockchain. My conclusion was: if you are not using a full node, then all your addresses are inevitably linked together by various third parties. Since Bitcoin Core receives all the information the Bitcoin network has, therefore nobody can figure out what information your wallet is interested in.  
This can be achieved in a lighter way by building a full-block SPV wallet which downloads blocks from the creation of the wallet, notes the transactions it is interested in and throws away the rest. Jonas Schnelli is also working on a wallet like this basedon Core.  
Therefore (1) if privacy is crucial for you and (2) you are not currently running a full node, you might want to consider changing when Core or we come out with our full-spv wallet, even if you are not interested in using TumbleBit.  
  
**2. TumbleBit integration**  
We are going to integrate [TumbleBit Classic Tumbler mode]( 
  
**3. Add Stratis wallet**  
I opt not to comment on this. We don't accept money from Stratis, therefore we are not going to do this. The development of this part is entirely up to them.  
  
**4. Decentralized BTC &lt;-&gt; STRAT exchange**  
This is an interesting topic. In theory you could exchange different cryptocurrencies with TumbleBit, exactly the same way you are exchanging bitcoins with it. We'll see how this topic will evolve as it's not a priority right now.

It is certainly possible. But this theory can be taken apart from many angles, like should we really assume any technology will stop evolving at one point?  
What if the ASIC manufacturer corrupts the miners, like "don't signal segwit, or you might experience some unfortunate delays!". Wait that's already happening today.  
And these are just two out of the top of my head, there are much more concerns about that vision.  
  
If it works out that's great. If it doesn't, that's a huge problem.
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:11:56
What if some dark hacker are sitting on their BU bugs, waiting until all miners decide if SegWit or BU and then keep the BU crashed as long as SegWit activates. Would be hilarious.

I don't believe TumbleBit can be a scaling solution without SegWit. It indeed scales to any number, but it also needs fixed denominations, that makes it hard to function as money. With SegWit there might be a couple of ways to dissolve it.

[2014 volume ]( is 100.8 billion transactions.  
That means 108 billion/365/24/6 = 2 054 794 transactions per blocks in average.  
The [Average Number Of Transactions Per Block]( is about 1800 today, which means 2054794/1800 = 1141 times bigger blocksize we need to handle the average Visa volume, which is roughly 1GB.  
[The payment volume of Visa]( almost doubled since 2014. Note, this is not the number of transactions, but the total money going through them. I use this data, because I cannot find data on transaction volumes, regarding 2016-17. From this we can make guess the transaction volume roughly doubled too, so we are already at 2GB blocksize just to handle the average volume.

As I see it he failed to manipulate 99% of the technical community, he failed to manipulate the majority of the trading community, based on the Bitfinex BTU token pricing and he failed to manipulate the darknet, too, since they just don't give a fuck. That's why he is attempting to find chokepoints. He failed to manipulate the businesses, like exchanges and he is succeeding to manipulate [Bitcoin's bottleneck]( the miners. Which is actually a good thing. We were digging our head into the sand about miners for too long. Now it's time for us to stand up and say: "shut up and process our transactions". Eventually we'd have much bigger problems from mining centralization, than this one. Imagine what if a less direct state controlled attack would've been the first time we'd have to stand up against the miners. That would be way more catastrophic.

The ETF is bad for Bitcoin in the long term. It should be pretty obvious, only our wallets want us to think otherwise.  
If you don't control your private key it's not your Bitcoin.  
The richer we woud've get from the ETF the worse it would've been for Bitcoin in the long term since the more the ETF elevates the price, more Bitcoin gets to be handled in a centralized manner, which leads to theft, hacking, bitcoins those only exist on paper and other problems.

Generally we're trying to loosely follow the design and UX of Visaul Studio, which starts in full screen mode. I'm not quite sure I'd have other arguments for or against full screen mode default start.  
But I suspect your question applies to something else that's closely related, if not sorry for needlessly elaborating on it: I remember a while ago we were working on trying to remember the position and size of the window that the user used it with the last time, so we can restore the same at next start, but we only succeeded to do this in Windows.

Hi guys, I am one of the developer behind the project. I would like to share some comments on this.  
  
I am working on TumbleBit, a trustless Bitcoin mixer, where not even the Tumbler can deanonymize you. I am not positive about it can solve any scaleability issues, but that's an other topic. At TumbleBit we have a couple of useability issues, like you have to use Bitcoin Core, you have to have a different output wallet, you have to do everything with terminal, etc, and nobody can work on it full time, since we are not getting payed for it.  
  
To sum up: we could use a little more man-power. I had the idea of contacting Stratis if they can lend us some. Stratis is working on a Bitcoin full-node in the same language TumbleBit is written, so they have a competent developer team.  
What they gain for it is marketing. An altcoin provides a Bitcoin wallet is a great marketing opportunity. We can outsource to them the GUI development, marketing, some code review and some testing. It's a win-win. Background story finished.  
  
About the wallet:  
We are planning 4 stages at the moment (at least me):  
1. Full-block SPV wallet.  
2. TumbleBit integration.  
3. Add Stratis wallet.  
4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange, based on TumbleBit.  
  
**1. Full-block SPV wallet**  
I [went to great lengths]( to figure out what is the lightest way to preserve privacy when retrieving information from the blockchain. And my conclusion was: today if you are not usin Bitcoin Core, then all your addresses are linked together by various third parties. Since Bitcoin Core receives all the information the Bitcoin network has, therefore nobody can figure out what information your wallet is intereted in.  
This can be achieved in a lighter way, by building a full-block SPV wallet, what downloads blocks from the creation of the wallet, notes the transaction it is interested in and throws away the rest (or something like this). Bitcoin Core is also working on a wallet like this.  
Therefore if privacy is crucial for you and Core or us came out with our full-spv wallet you might consider changing, even if you are not interested in using TumbleBit.  
  
**2. TumbleBit integration**  
We are going to integrate TumbleBit Classic Tumbler mode. 
  
**3. Add Stratis wallet**  
I cannot comment on this. We don't accept money from Stratis, therefore we are not going to concentrate on it. The development of this part is entirely up to them.  
  
**4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange**  
This is a very interesting topic. In theory you could exchange different coins with TumbleBit, just like you are exchanging bitcoins (mixing). We'll see how this topic will evolve, not a priority right now.

The TumbleBit hub doesn't need segwit either. It's a [little more complicated]( but there is however a 3rd mode of TumbleBit, that cannot be built without SegWit and indeed that is a payment hub, too, but instead of uni-directional, it's bi-directional.

To find out if you're vulnerable I think you can do a filesearch for `unacev2.dll`.  
1. Click Start Menu, type `cmd`. Then start typing the following commands:
2. `cd c:\` - Now you are in the root of the C drive. If you have more drives make sure to search there too.
3. `dir /s *unacev2*`
This will search for every file recursively that contains the string `unacev2`. I'm pretty sure it's a case insensitive search, since Windows filesystem is case insensitive.  
If it finds files, examine what's up with them.

The PM is the head of the executive branch and coordinates the actions of other ministers. He is appointed by the president (after approval by the parliament).
The president is the head of the state. He is not in fact part of the executive branch, but is rather sort of above the three branches of government. He is also directly controls the army (as commander-in-chief) and the siloviki - i.e. police, FSB and other security agencies.
Overall, the PM is considered a rather technical role, not a decision maker. This was not the case though during Medvedev's presidency. While nominally second to Medvedev, Putin (who could not run for a third term as president in a row) was de facto the man in charge.

Wallet developer here. I went through it quickly, I did not find anything that's technically impossible.  
A note:  
  


  
My idea here:  
There can be a script that does nothing else, but when sending money to it, it evenly split bitcoins to a pre-defined value, like 0.1BTCs and send them to your home banking device. So every time you send money to your script it fills the next addresses to be all 0.1btc.  
Therefore you can transmit those 0.1btc worth of private keys out of your cold wallet without internet.

Right. That's a great question and it can be approached in so many different ways, since it all comes down to an adversary. In Wasabi I'm removing the taint after 50 anonset reached on a coin, (so 2% taint) but that's pretty much an arbitrary number. We had to choose something and 2% probability "seems right."  
And let's not get into the impossibility of proper entropy/anonset calculations.

It depends how you define bad actors. I personally think there are 0.001% bad actors.  
For example those who sent out the [ethereum spams]( or the still ongoing [vote manipulation] ( and a bunch of others we do not know about. These are not 75% of the people, but sure they make an impact on the opinion of everyone else.

In 2015 I went for a date to a restaurant that accepts Bitcoin. I talked about Bitcoin during the whole dinner. At the end it turned out they did not accept it anymore.  
Next dinner in another place they accepted it. I paid exactly 0.5BTC.  
About half a year later we broke up because I secured my first Bitcoin job by only having half an hour after the first interview to pack my stuff, say goodbye and hurry to the airport.

@_date: 2018-10-19 08:18:47
Right, that's why I said "BIP157-158-like." The goal was to maximize privacy first, performance second, and then nothing else.  
It is important to notice that while we do central validation, we don't do it in the traditional sense, since we are requesting filters over Tor, thus unlike centrally validating servers, where the server can target users based on IP address, our server doesn't know who to lie to. Furthermore, the server doesn't provide transaction data, but it comes from Bitcoin nodes, so the server would have to 1. lie to every client first, then setup a bunch of ghost Bitcoin nodes and make sure the targeted client only connects to its nodes. But this is getting silly.  
The point is, even though decentralized validation was not one of Wasabi's design goal, it ended up achieving it to an extent.
Another thing to note that, at the time all roads were leading to your ["bips repository clone"]( where there is one BIP draft and we were not aware of the final BIP157-158. Or maybe at the time that didn't even exist.

Early coins are lost. Early coins are vulnerable of a theoretical quantum computing attack. There is no way anyone would take the risk of not moving them. That's just not how humans work. Although you could argue Bitcoin was not invented by humans and then we suddenly have something to talk about, but in my opinion that is very unlikely.

Let's take the first mode of TumbleBit. It can work like, it makes a round in every hour. These transactions are leaving specific clues on the blockchain, so someone might can identify which addresses are participating in a round, but no way to tell which addresses sent to which one.  
If you "tumble your coins with yourself" then the party who identified the input and output addresses of the round looks at your transactions and it only sees the pattern, ergo it has no idea if you tumbled your coins with yourself or participated in one of the tumbler's tumbling.

It's targeting Bitcoin Core's `estimatesmartfee 1008 CONSERVATIVE` meaning it makes sure a CJ tx will confirm within 1 week. On the other hand, so far all txs confirmed within a few minutes or hours.


There is no, because that incentivizes bad privacy practice: address reuse. If someone doesn't reuse address, then one can do everything with the "Coins" concept.  
As an example, if you generate a receive address with "Joe" label, and receive money on it, then the History of your coin will be "Joe".  
However, if you send a transaction that uses "Joe" and "Foo" coins, it'll generate a change with the history: "change of (Joe), change of (Foo)".  
Now, the only thing where coins don't fully replace in a superior way the address list is where you are waiting for donations, since address reuse here (unless stealth or payment codes are used) is unavoidable. For that it'd be ideal to figure something, maybe an address view just as you requested:) it's not priority though.

I see. The target confirmation rate there is 6h. In the last months there were about two days a month where many coinjoins were unconfirmed for a day or so. While you can spend unconfirmed coins with Wasabi, unfortunately Bitcoin Core's IsStandard limits doesn't let you spend when too many unconfirmed transactions are depending on each other. We're trying to optimize this in various ways, but I'm afraid there's no real good solution that'd completely make the issue go away other than waiting it out :(

I see, we started working on the code [in February.]( so I think designing the architecture preceded it by a couple of weeks.

Unfortunately signing cannot be delegated, since at the time of registering you don't know the final transaction that can be signed.  
I hit my head on this problem many times, there's only one good solution for this: liquidity.  
We've chosen the target anonymity set to 100 and the target denomination to 0.1BTC, because with these values, if we'd have the currently largest mixer's liquidity, a coinjoin round will go through within 3-5 minutes.

I don't mean to be disrespectful, but please don't throw out buzzwords, like they'd solve anything. A zero-knowledge protocol is just a tool, it doesn't make anything "totally untracable." Pay 2 EndPoint uses it. Wasabi's upcoming [Unequal Input Mixing]( will likely have to use it.  
But links between one set of coins and another set of coins will always be there, no matter the marketing budget of an altcoin. The only question is how strong those links are. And my point was with the above analysis that the links in Wasabi are pretty damn weak.

Objectively speaking the privacy traditional banks have their benefits. I know it's fun to bash them, but your wife will never know you've bought a yacht, because that transaction won't hit the blockchain.  
If you are using a real Bitcoin wallet, not a Bitcoin bank, your wife can just taint some of your wallet (you won't even notice) and then check  and there you go, where did that 100 bitcoin left your wallet? Wait, you have 100 bitcoins? Things are about to change here...

How do you count the miners? How do you know they are not all the same miner, just using different pools?  
If you ask here how many people are mining and how many people are running full node, it would be like 1:100.  
It is not proof of IP, until the full nodes are involved in any kind of decision.  
If we would say full-nodes can vote for segwit that would be proof of IP, what would be a disaster, since there would be an incentive to fake it.  
However today there is not much incentive to fake fullnodes, therefore the OP's 60% number is very relevant.

Yeah, I must agree (and went the upvote.) While we have good reasons, this is a perfectly valid criticism of a product. It's really not how these things should work and believe me I'm way more frustrated about it than you are.  
For context, I was trying to fight for it to be a one-liner, but the lawyers didn't like the idea. It's basically what said, plus there are a bunch of (I think) unnecessary stuff in it that I cannot comprehend how that can be useful, like defining "Personally Identifiable Information" and such. But this is not my field of expertise, so I roll with it. There are probably a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't think can be relevant, yet it is not unheard of that govs are targeting those who are fighting for freedom not based on what they do, because privacy and human rights are covered pretty well in the law in most places, but rather they find something unrelated and take a stab in that.  
For example Cody Wilson is in prison, not because of the 3D printing gun, but because of something completely unrelated thing that smells like a "set up" from miles away.  
On the bright side, we don't know if you installed/created or used the wallet, since the wallet tunnels through communication over Tor.

Chief Redditor of TumbleBit here. It is a very strong headline, I think I have to comment on it to not get the wrong idea.  
TumbleBit can operate in multiple modes, the first, the simplest is the classic tumbler mode, where the code is ready and is currently under testing.  
Just to make sure headline readers don't get the wrong idea, **it will be painfully slow** at first. It will get as fast as 2 transactions fast as the volume goes up.  
Regarding the payment hub mode, the short answer is: it is indeed instant. [Read the long answer here.](

The wallets follow the chain with the longest header chain. However, as you said, it is unlikely they'll be connected to sw2x nodes.  
But at the moment they connect to one the wallet reorgs to sw2x chain, then if they lose that node and Core becomes longer than the last seen sw2x header, it'll reorg back to Core. Such flipflopping is far from fud.

It is not news, but rather a great way to describe what TubmleBit is.  
  
If you want some crazy news,  a few days ago we realized if tumblers are using the same parameters from the outside, just by inspecting the blockchain nobody is able to tell which tumbler you are using, so you are not restricted to the k-anonimity of one tumbler but rather the k-anonimity of all the mixing that happens in that cycle. In fact you could even tumble your coins with yourself and nobody would be able to tell. This is a pretty interesting new development. And even we cannot see what are the impliecations of this in practice yet.

I think your main concern is if we lose all our coins. No.  
There are two scenario:  
- The internet never comes back: in this case we can still use build a radio waves(frequencies) and microwaves or what you have system and cointinue transacting as said.  
- The internet comes back: we continue transacting.  
  
The main point to realize: the private keys are generated offline. You can generate a private key on paper and its corresponding address, then ask people to send money to it. You have to only go online when you want to spend the money. It is because you have to sign the transaction and submit it.  
In fact you can create the transaction "on paper", offline and sign it. Then you type your bits and bytes into the online computer and submit that transaction, so your private key didn't even touch an online computer and you still made a transaction.

**Update:** This topic got me thinking. Further thoughts on it can be found here: 
Let's take the first output of the most recent coinjoin: 
Where can it come from? There are 20 inputs it could possibly come from. Out of that 8 inputs are remixed coins, they result in perfect mixes, coming directly from previous coinjoins.  
1.  
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
Out of the 8, 2 coins are coming from the same coinjoin. So, that leaves 7. Thus we are at anonymity set 12. Now let's do the same thing for all these transactions, too:  
1. 8/20 remixes.
2. 11/20 remixes.
3. 9/20 remixes.
4. 10/20 remixes.
5. ...
6. ...
7. ...
Thus we are at anonymity set 12 + (12 + 9 + 11 + 10 + ... + ... + ...).
And then let's go one level deeper in the transaction graph. And then one level deeper. And so on... Turtles all the way down. So the first output of the most recent coinjoin can originate from who knows how many places.  
Post-mix input joining and change-mixing worsens the above model, however, at the very least it is incorrect to say "It at best increases anonymity set a bit."

It can be added to any Bitcoin wallet and can be used with most mixing techniques (CoinJoin, CoinShuffle, TumbleBit), but it also defines its own mixing technique: Chaumian CoinJoin.

The RoundID is a fairly useless piece of information, I've been on the edge of removing it a couple of times. It simply means how many rounds have been created by the coordinator, since its last restart.  
It can be useful when for example an attacked DoS attacking the coordinator, in that case the RoundID would inflate to huge numbers (and the attacker would burn resources of course).
The coordinator fee goes for maintenance and development of the wallet. Well, not yet, but hopefully in the future. Since we launched the beta (2 months) the sum of all the fees taken was less than $200, and over 100BTC went through the mix. At this point it doesn't even cover the hosting expenses of the coordinator, but I'm hopeful it'll get better, since the growth of user base didn't show any sign of stopping yet.

Oh, you are right. As I checked the BU github I saw the same pattern in as in the brownish one. I thought BU github had low activity, but I did not think all the activity there is actually just pulling Core's code.  
Sorry @_date: 2017-08-14 15:21:27
They replaced their bc.i backend with their own backend. Not like that'd make it much more private, but at least they have greater control (especially if they are not logging, like bc.i). In any case other than Bitcoin Core, Armory, Breeze Wallet and Hidden Wallet **all** Bitcoin wallets [shares the same information with third parties]( It's even worse in SPV wallets, because they share with every spoofer, not only with one party (the backend server). The reason is, because ([as Mike Hearn explained]( retrieving private transaction infromation is hard. Nearly impossible without waiting terribly long to sync.  
In ZeroLink it's better, because the limitations of ZeroLink is actually its strongness in this regard. Hopefully even mobile wallets could comfortably utilize it:

The idea is to build up to 100 with 1-2 rounds per day. And when that is reached, don't increase it further.  
With 100 anonymity set, 0.1BTC denomination and with the self reported volume of the now defunct bitmixer.io, a round would happen about every 3-5 minutes. So we identified it as the practical limit of the anonymity set.

Don't be surprised of downvotes if you share deceiving content. It took me 5 minutes of browsing github to realize you swapped the colors at the end.  
  
Regarding of how relevant this graph is: most of those small BU commits are actually merging critical updates from core.  
  
**Update:** It turnes out I completely misinterpreted this graph. There is no color swap. This graph actually shows that all the BU activity recently is pulling Core's code.

I have no time to read it through now, but do you say it could be implemented in core, therefore core would automatically relay everything through a privacy preserving network instead of manually configuring tor for that? If so and if this is a clean solution it could be a significant improvement.

I agree with you with all the other three categories for the following reason, except on the Ease of Use, so I am surprised you had to bring that one up. As I noted there:


However Ease of use is not that error prone, at least not today.  
Today, the only things they really matter is 
1. How much time/stuff stuff you must do in order to get the wallet setup and run.
2. How much you must wait every time you open your wallet.
Is there a user interface difference between Samourai and Jaxx? Sure there is, but does the user interface difference matter if you compare them to a heavy weight wallet, like Core that you must download sync for a week, then, every time you open it, you'll have to wait 5-10 minutes before you can use it.

China has already "banned" Bitcoin.  
As far as I understand how Chinese policies work, they don't really outright ban things, they first spread FUD, then make it very hard for people to do certain things, but not impossible. They only ban when the situation gets really out of hands, like talking about Tiannanmen square.  
  
For example you can't use Google, Facebook in China, except you can. It is making hard to use VPNs, they are very unreliable, but still, it is legal to use them and 90% of the Chinese internet users are using them.

TumbleBit has 2-3 ways to work. The Classic Tumbler mode is the simplest one.  
This mode won't make it mainstream. Other modes will. This mode provides much stronger privacy, than CJ, but it is slower.  
The plan is to release a command line interface this month and set up a Tumbler server that lets you do mixes in 1btc denominations per day. This is not written in stone yet.  
Also we need bitcoins in order to provide liquidity, since the Tumbler need to have as much money to escrow as much volume goes through it. This will be an interesting problem to solve.

To be fair this is not only the easiest, but the most important. This is exactly the reason why I don't fell (anymore) to the blockchain hype.  
When it comes up I always ask: "so you are doing blockchain? Does it have limited supply?" If the answer is no that is an obvious red flag.
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:05:24
In Super Saiyan level it is more limited. Every mix requires 2 transactions (if I remember well, these transactions are 1.5 more expensive than a normal one.)  
Therefore if the mix's denomination is 0.1btc and you want to mix 1btc you have to pay 10x2x1.5xnormal transaction fee.  
Of course if there is liquidity for other denominations there will be other denominations.  
  
In Super Saiyan 3 level, since you can send any number of transaction for free through the payment channel I think we can use the smallest denomination that still preserves privacy.  
We know that if we would use 1 satoshi then by simple amount analysis of the opening and closing transactions it is easy to decide who sent where.  
That being said confidential transactions might be useful here to abolish the denominations entirely.

My reasoning is because early on the coins were sent to pubkeys and not to pubkeyhashes (addresses). And the pubkeys might be volnurable to QC when it becomes reality. Anyway, I don't think any sane person would risk to lose them, no matter how theoretical is the QC attack is.

Sidechains need segwit. Lightning w/o segwit is a little risky. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the risk with lightning comes if the user doesn't monitor if the hub tries to fuck its over. Which's consequences I am not able to predict at this point.

If you want privacy you no other option but to run a full node. And you won't even get perfect one like that. Any blockchain analisys comany can tie together most of your addresses with a high probability if you are using SPV:  
If you are using HTTP API, a web wallet or a centralized web wallet your privacy depends 100% on your service provider.  
  
As long as this is the case running a full node should not be a luxury.  
  
No, nodes are not ran by enthusiasts. Nodes are ran by people who want privacy and or reliability.

Let me clear something up. This version is the classic Tumbler version. The next step is unildirectional payment hubthen maybe bidirectional payment hub. The classic Tumbler mode does nothing for scaling...  
But also I think in order to make this a scaling solution I think we need confidential transactions. And for that segwit. Because TB, even if in payment hub mode needs fixed denominations. Although arguably we can lower the denominations to as low as 0.01btc in payment hub mode "today", but that still doesn't seem enough for me.

These are not a minor advantages.


False. Privacy is extremely useful. If it is enforced in the protocol that is indeed better.


That is the point of TB. You cannot write stuff that enforces in the protocol level, then you have to write a second layer.  
The only failure that can happen here is the server goes offline forever so the user has to wait a little time until it gets refunded.  
I believe the author of the article did a very poor biased job and take Spagni's comments completely out of context to misrepresent what he meant.  
  
 **Blockstream Mathematician Andrew Poelstra**


It all comes down to how much users you have. If one round of TB will have more users than one transaction of zcash then TB has better anonimity set.

Recently I've came out with [ZeroLink]( that's an on-chain Bitcoin fungibility framework. Note: off-chain fungibility techniques are Mimblewimble, privacy sidechains and drivechains, TumbleBit's payment hub mode, etc...  
ZeroLink defines a pre-mix and a post-mix wallet and a mixing technique.  
Pre-mix wallet functionality can be added to any Bitcoin wallet without much overhead. Post-mix wallets on the other hand have strong privacy requirements, regarding coin selection, private transaction and balance retrieval, transaction input and output indexing and broadcasting. The requirements and recommendations for pre and post-mix wallets together define the Wallet Privacy Framework.  
Coins from pre-mix wallets to post-mix wallets are moved by mixing. Most on-chain mixing techniques, like CoinShuffle, CoinShuffle++ or TumbleBit's Classic Tumbler mode can be used. However ZeroLink defines its own mixing technique: Chaumian CoinJoin.

That is true. But keep in mind the exponential growth starts out slower than the linear one. An interesting question would be: did we reach the turning point? In the last year the node count did not go down too much so I guess we are getting there:   
  
By the way I did not argue we should keep the pace of the growth of blockchain at this steady linear speed. In fact I would strongly argue against it, I think that is what you think my argument was.  
  
My argument was it is a misleading at best, manipulation at worst to say the blocksize should grow as fast as the storage technology.  
A better thing to argue for would be that the blockchain should grow as fast as the storage technology.

I would like to know what actually happened in this event, because it is easy to see how biased the author is, therefore many of the facts and numbers peresented here are not exactly right or with a little malicious intention may also be lies.  
  
For example we had a protest in Hungary back in 2015 against taxing the internet. There were a few thousand people on the streets, as time went on the articles on it inflated the numbers, I guess the last ones were over 100,000, if I remember well on Bloomberg.

I personally support every attemp that aims to deliver privacy. I have a lot of conceptual questions about Bob wallet and its review is on my todo list, however I just cant find the time to do it. On the first glance, it seems to me a decent project.  
Regarding my project, it's in the finish line and already deployed on the mainnet, only the GUI is missing, I just again: didn't have time to announce stuff. For that watch my upcoming the Building Bitcoin conference talk. If all goes well I'll announce a mainnet release there.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:52:19
I am lazy to look up, but the agreement was vague. If I remember well technically nobody broke the agreement yet, because of the following reasons:  
Some core-dev who signed agreed they will prepare the code for 2mb hardfork after segwit.  
IF they finish the code, the agreement is not broken.  
However they did not agree that code to be included into Core version for a simple reason: they have no this kind of power.  
Antpool did not break the agreement yet, but threatening to not signal for segwit equals to threatening to break the agreement. Interestingly they have one year to start signalling, so it can very well be just a bluff. Arguably even more, since the 1 year time period for softforks are just to free up the version bit or something like that, then it can start activating again, if it does not by then.  
  
It is not clear for me what comes first: signalling for segwit or get the 2mb code ready. Both of them can happen in the same time.  
But let me reiterate: **the core developers who agreed to sign have no power on forcing their consensus on the rest of the core developers.**

In my opinion the ETF is bad for Bitcoin in the long term.  
If you don't control your private key it's not your Bitcoin and everyone else who disagrees is a hypocrite.  
  
However I will cheer the ETF, because I have economic incentives to do so. The richer I get from the ETF the worse it will be for Bitcoin in the long term since the more the ETF elevates the price, more Bitcoin goes to be handled in a centralized manner.  
  
People can philosophize all day long and they can come to conclusions that ETF is good for Bitcoin, no, ETF is good for our wallets. If you don't control your private key it is not your Bitcoin.

I had an idea I started to work on before something more exciting came in to work on (TumbleBit).  
  
It was about a teaching website where you either pay or contribute. For your contribution, like creating a new lesson you got payed by those who payed.  
There was no way to pay out not only legally but technically every kind of people from everywhere in the world without totally invading their privacy.  
  
If they close us out I am totally going to create this stuff and then all the druggers will only be able to spend their money on my website.  
But of course it won't only be me who recognizes this opportunity, there will be hundreds of thousands of people creating things, because a lot of people will have a lot of bitcoins that they cannot sell, but want to spend on something.

If the costs are constantly getting lower why the number of full nodes are constantly getting lower, too?  
If the experiment disproves your theory throw that theory in the trash.

Sorry, I copypasted my other post where I added a link what I meant by SPV wallets privacy problems, but missed it here:   
  
These methods are not about key derivation, but just monitoring the activity of SPV wallets.  
  


  
It is because Electrum is not real SPV (or some would argue, it's not SPV at all), I am not entirely familiar with the protocol on how a client queries the Electrum servers, so I wouldn't go into it.  
  


  
What do you mean by this?  
  


  
With a full node you don't query anyone on the internet, since you have the full blockchain on your hard drive in the first place. So you just read your disk on how much bitcoins you have. That is why a full-node is the most private way to "query" the blockchain.

1. Look for UTXOs on the blockchain that have already exposed their pubkeys (like address reuse.)  
2. Create a transaction that spends this UTXO and a UTXO of yours, encrypt it with the pubkey and publish this encrypted message "anywhere."
3. Anyone who finds an encrypted message to his own UTXO "anywhere", he can decide to sign and broadcast that transaction.

1. Bandwidth is absolutely not an issue right now, it does not affect anyone. I am changing where I live in every 2 weeks, sometimes very 3rd world countries with very shitty internet and I never had a problem, the blockchain synced up the last 2 days within minutes.  
I did not find any place where the blockchain did not sync, no matter how instable/slow the internet was. This is not the reason why the nodes are running.  
  
2. There are immediate benefits for average users: privacy.     
If you want privacy you no other option but to run a full node. And you won't even get perfect one like that. Any blockchain analisys comany can tie together most of your addresses with a high probability if you are using SPV:  
If you are using HTTP API, a web wallet or a centralized web wallet your privacy depends 100% on your service provider.     
The black market is booming, the full-nodes should be booming, too, but they don't.  
  
The size of the blockchain is the reason of the decreasing full-nodes.

It doesn't matter how profitable mining is until the network already 1000 times more secured than it's minimum should be.  
More profitable the whole mining ecosystem = more miners is bullshit, it's a kicking the can down the road tactic.  
More accessible mining = more miner is the preferred way.    
  
On chain transactions must become expensive, because more people are using Bitcoin. If we are aiming to go anything close to VISA level on-chain scaling is out of question. 1GB blocks cannot even handle a subway system.

Full Block Spv wallet is a new type of Bitcoin wallet, that skips initial blockchain downloading, rather it only downloads blocks from the creation of the wallet.  
Why is this good?  
(1) More people can validate blocks (and serve, too?), with less disk space and fast onboarding.    
(2) Privacy! If you are not using Bitcoin Core or a full block spv wallet, blockchain analysis companies can connect together all your wallet addresses, based on network analysis.  
Such full block spv wallets are new. HiddenWallet and Breeze wallet are currently out there.  
  
  
It also worth to say that, the above PR is about to enable a configurable block serving functionality for developers, not the whole full block SPV wallet PR, but it's closely related and the first step towards it.

Many high profile people are against privacy. The scaling wars will seem like a joke compared to to the upcoming anonymity wars.
Add this to the current situation. It's likely miners will try to prevent any upcoming soft fork, just because of politics.  


I had a reddit post recently where I answered, so I'll paste it here. [[1]]( 
# Development status?  
 **Mixing**
During the past days we just conducted our first successful mixes on the testnet. The software is experimental, mainnet is not supported.  
 **Wallet Privacy Framework**
Half of the wallet privacy framework is already implemented into HiddenWallet. [See: ZeroLink Checklist](  
# Is there GUI?
Yes, there is a GUI:) [Here's me mixing with myself]( on the testnet.
# Estimated Time of Arrival?  
At this point we are undecided if we'd like to release an unstable, experimental version or not. If we decide to do so, we'll do it within 2 months, otherwise it'll be around half a year.  
Since the Wallet Privacy Framework is not fully implemented yet, if decide to release within two months we'll not be able to provide perfect anonymity with ZeroLink.  
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:32:42
That was one of my thought, too.  
Before the 2x drama I was on the opinion of "blocksize increase is fine". Then I saw how the 2x guys main plan was to hijack SPV wallets to follow their chain and I thought: "well, validating nodes matter a lot more, than I thought after all".  
Now that 2x failed spectacularly I'm revisiting my change of mind. However if full block SPVs go mainstream, then the Bitcoin network gains a lot of resiliency, which might justify blocksize increase again.

I think it's the failure of Reddit as a platform. It's a great evolution, compared to, let's say USENET, traditional forum or facebook groups, yet it does not seem to be good enough for casual Bitcoiner conversations.  
I also think comparing it to stackexchange or github does not help, because those platforms are where the shit gets done. Reddit is more like a casual site, where we are primarily here to have fun, but sometimes shit also gets done.

bitcoinj is a library and it provides you the ability to write the bloom filtering SPV.  
Since bloom filtering SPV does not download full blocks, like the full block downloading SPV wallet, bitcoinj's SPV is faster.  
However the full SPV wallet can validate some consensus rules (like blocksize) and more private.

I wrote back then a slightly [more detailed explanation]( in case some here would not be familiar with the **context** at all:  
His idea was to roll out a [new block size limit at 20MB]( [Other than Mike Hearn]( there was not a single developer who got behind his proposal. And instead of trying to find a scaling solution he decided to bypass the consensus of the develoepers and [started a campaign]( instead to convince everyone else.  
It played a role, but there were other reasons why his commit access has been revoked. 
He had already not been contributing to Bitcoin for over a year, and many Core developers asking him to voluntarily drop his access already. Why would someone have one if the person is not contributing. The tip of the iceberg was when he [wrote a blog post]( on the identity of Satoshi. He believed (possibly still believes) Craig Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin. He allegedly proved it to him in person. While [his presented public proofs turned all out to be fake]( quickly, other developers [were concerned if Gavin got hacked]( therefore as a precaution revoked his commit access. They did not automatically gave it back to him after he clarified he was not hacked.

I won't relisten the interview, but I know what you are referring to and I'm happy to elaborate:
Anonymity != Unobservability. Anonymity is when you are verifiably anonymous within a set of peers, and it's near to impossible to describe LN's privacy with the classical entropist/anonymity set model. Since LN provides a probabilistic privacy that introduces many variables like non-spying LN hubs and watchtowers it's really hard to build verifiable privacy on LN, yet we can see that LN in general still provides way better privacy than a blockchain will ever do. It's just cannot be verified or at least not with the models I am familiar with.
It is a very similar situation to how some academics were trying to (mis-)characterize the Tor network's privacy with the anonset model:


the anonymity protection Tor provides in entropist terms. For example, “[t]he anonymity provided by Tor relies on the size of the anonymity set. Currently, there are around 1500 ORs, and an estimated quarter million Tor users.” [43].

I'd like to grab the opportunity to clear up the general misconceptions those come up every time this email is discussed.  
  
**TLDR:** This was the email what Satoshi used. The email was not spoofed and the authenticity of this email has never been debunked. Bear in mind: **not disproved ≠ proved.**  
**Sources:** You can find comprehensive references of my claims in the blog post: [Not all post 2011 Satoshi appearance has been debunked](  
**Personal opinion:** Regardless if this email came from Satoshi or not, the content is instructive and it aged well.  
**Context:** In the August of 2015 someone sent this email to the dev mailing list from satoshi as a response to Gavin Andresen's and Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT fork attempt. This attempt also was accompanied by a [vote manipulation attack on This resulted in a persecution of Core developers by this sub. Kinda like what you see today at
which did not exist at the time.  


Technical analysis showed:  


**FAQ 1: But Craig Wright used this email address, right?**  
No, he used satoshin to deceive us, not the real satoshi  
**FAQ 2: But this email had been hacked, right?**  
No, satoshin was hacked, more specifically re-registered after it expired.  
**FAQ 3: But he didn't sign it with his PGP.**

**CONTEXT:** Confidential Transactions hide the amount, which basically the source of all evil for every mixing scheme.
Unfortunately it does this in expense of much larger transactions (see Monero).  
At the beginning it made the transactions to about ~60 times larger, while improvements had been made on this, such scaleability tradeoff made it unlikely that it'll ever get into Bitcoin.  
However a week ago, at Scaling Bitcoin a new paper was presented (Bulletproofs), which, to sum up, reduced CT transaction sizes to be about 4x larger than normal ones.

For future reference I copypaste my private answer, since I've seen Max's private message first.  
Hi there, yes and no, because fees are varying, so we can even out inputs those are very close to each other in value. Fees can go from -0.1% to 1%. (Yes, the CJ sometimes even pays you, nevermind now.)  
0.3% is our target fee. More accurately our target fee is 0.003% per anonymity set, which would be 0.3% at 100 peers. Currently it's about 50-60 peers, so our target is 0.15%.  
Now the question is how much fees were paid so far?  
`6.92505741/(10445/100)=0.06%` is our historical average fee.
  
You can go onto the [Wasabi website]( and see that 10445BTC has been mixed so far. 1% of it is 104,45BTC. And you can see that the [total income of Wasabi]( was 6.925... from the coordinator address.  
Which is 0.06% of the whole mixed amount.

I don't think Mimblewimble will ever get into Bitcoin. It'll likely be an altcoin. Hopefully a sidechain.  
Confidential Transactions on the other hand (which simply hide the amount of the transaction) can reduce the complexity of ZeroLink by 90% and they solve most of the user experience issues in ZeroLink, which are imposed in order to not compromise full anonymity.  
Plus they make ZeroLink dirt cheap for large holders.  
Nevertheless I'd say it's 3-10 years when we'll see it in Bitcoin, if ever. I wonder if such soft fork would go well.

Hi there, Wasabi is best used alone. If you involve other wallets after the mix, you most likely lose your privacy against someone. There are way too many ways to write them all, but a simplest example would be:
0. Send coins from Ledger.
1. Mix.
2. Send coins to Ledger.
Ledger sends your extpubkey to their server, which is all the address you ever used, which means they know your pre-mix coins and your post-mix coins. That being said, confidentiality is not a terrible privacy model, it just depends on your threat model.

The confusion comes from because we are rolling out features partially.
The most basic feature that was present for half a year now was simply block fetching. The idea was that I am running a full node on my laptop so it's easy to fetch blocks from it instead of downloading from remote source. It also gives you information theoretically perfect privacy although [I don't think](  ) there is any practical difference between it and the light mode where you fetch blocks from random and distinct Bitcoin Core onion nodes over new Tor streams, but it can certainly give a peace of mind.
Anyhow, this feature that we call "alternative block source" works with any full node, not only Bitcoin Core, so you can use eg. Knots, libbitcoin, etc... and with remote nodes too, even over onion.
The new feature that is implemented and will be released in a few days ([track release progress here](  )) is not a replacement of the old feature, as is shipping with Bitcoin Core and relies on the user either using Wasabi's built-in Bitcoin Core or gives the proper data folder directory of his own Core. This also relies heavily on RPC, so only Core/Knots and other Core derivants can be used with it.  
However this is still a work in progress, as block validation is left to be implemented. Currently the following features are implemented:
- Your Bitcoin Core serves the mempool instead of random nodes.
- Your Bitcoin Core serves the fee estimation instead of Wasabi backend.
- Your Bitcoin Core is the fallback transaction broadcasting mechanism instead of Wasabi backend. (IMO Wasabi's tx broadcasting is slightly more private than Core's, as explained in the article, so that's why it's only a fallback.)
- Shipping with Bitcoin Core. (It's just one click, I'm pretty proud of it, you just have to turn on a toggle button in the Settings :)
- Block fetching from Bitcoin Core instead of random nodes or the above mentioned alternative block source mechanism.
Let me rehash it, while the above features will go live in a few days, it's still work in progress, because the block validation is not yet implemented.

As far as I know LN nodes can stay under the radar. AlphaBay [or insert any anonymous party with a lot of coins] can just make an LN node, your transaction would be routed through it, because its well-connectedness and low fees. There's no failure of centralization. Centralization is bad when it can cause problems, but when it doesn't, then it's superior to decentralization. Decentralization for the shake of decentralization is why all these blockchain ideas are failing around us. They serve no purpose.

No. Wasabi doesn't query wallet balances. Until today Wasabi queried block filters over Tor from our own backend. These are a constant set of filters. Based on this information Wasabi was able to figure out which blocks the wallet was interested in and asked for blocks from random Bitcoin nodes one by one (disconnecting a node after got a block.) This happened over the clearnet. It's really just nitpicking to add Tor to this block fetching workflow.  
Also not if you have (and had) a full node running in the background Wasabi fetches blocks from them instead of random peers.
[I recently wrote an article]( where I compared the following wallets from the point of network level privacy: Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core + Tor, Wasabi 1.1.3 (the previous version), Wasabi 1.1.4 (the current version) and Wasabi + Bitcoin Core (yes, they work together.)

Here is my informal roadmap for you if you are serious about helping:  
1. Learn git and open an issue or a pull request for a need for a formal roadmap.  
2. Share it on reddit, so the reddit crowd goes behind you if you choose your words wisely.  
3. Chances are you going to get rejected by the developer community, since 90% consensus is not consensus here. If not then progress further, examine the issue write your formal roadmap and let others to contribute, hopefully a consensus will emerge that will replace the old roadmap with the new better one.  
4. In case you fail, you lost time, but you gained knowledge and you can show up your early contribution to the most important project of the history of mankind in your resume.

Personally I completely share those opinions, but I believe this debate is on a huge sidetrack. This debate is about "if you can trust what your SPV/third party api provider tells you on what transactions happened."  
And I am sharing the opinion of those technical people that you can and the hard Core people are just way too inflexible on this question.  
As long as a minimal number of full nodes can support the network, we are ok. (Which is a whole new debate is what that number should be.)  
  
However, why I said this debate is completely sidetracked is that literally nobody is talking about the privacy inferiority of every wallet compared to full nodes. I [wrote a long research]( on the topic and there are a couple of ways to create full node level privacy to normal wallets, but as long as full nodes are the only way to protect (or not lose it completely) your privacy I am fully on board with the "full node advocating people", even if for different reasons.

For example they might try to propagate two different transactions on both chains the same time from the same utxo a couple of times and if it succeeds once, they can use the input that is only valid on one chain, join your coins together with that input and this way the transaction can be only valid on one chain.

While this is not correct, but the end result is the same. I explained it in the above linked post.  
  
The thing is SPV wallets are sending bloom filters. These bloom filters are collected by blockchain analysis companies and with these bloom filters and with clustering strategies all their addresses are exposed by the bc survelliance companies (not directly by the nodes).

Note these people are not falling for rbtc propaganda as the rbtc people, they are falling for them by thinking their position might have some validity, so they are trying to overcompensate and say bullshit things, like Bitcoin is a settlement system and stuff. In fact the many people who say Bitcoin is a settlement system, they refer to the base layer, what's indeed terrible to be a payment network, however they are usually in the position that we can build superfast systems on top of this base layer where the unit of value IS btc, but this sadly is almost always lost in the conversation.

Unfortunately one cannot examine the system in itself, but has to consider the context. There are just so many factors play here, than simply coinprice, block rewards and transaction fees.  
  
* There's the self esteem: "I cannot let anyone else to know that I was wrong on SegWit, I'd rather see Bitcoin burn to the ground." - Roger Ver.  
* There's the price manipulation: "Haha, I just bought a bunch of LTC, now I'll start mining SegWit and the price will skyrocket" - Wang Chun  ([This really happened.](
* And there's the hidden agenda: "I just patented and built ASICBOOST that gives me 30% more profit than my stupid competitors. SegWit would ruin it, so I have to fight against it with all my power." - Jihan Wu  
  
And I just barely touched the surface.
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:42:43
I must clarify the statistics. I wrote this a while ago and this was my algorithm:
IEnumerable&lt;(Money value, int count)&gt; coinjoin = tx.GetIndistinguishableOutputs().Where(x =&gt; x.count &gt; 1).OrderByDescending(x =&gt; x.count);
if (coinjoin.Any() &amp;&amp; coinjoin.First().count &lt;= tx.Inputs.Count)
This means, if the largest number of indistinguishable outputs in the transaction larger than one and smaller than the number of inputs then I considered it as a coinjoin transaction.
As you can notice, I did not have access to input values, however that could further rule out more false positives.
In the calculation of the number in the [Wasabi Site]( I use the same algorithm (not to filter out the Wasabi coinjoins, but to calculate the final indistinguishable output number.)
IIRC the number there (since August) is ~~about 3-4%~~ exactly 3.5% of the total coinjoin transactions. I don't have numbers for the latest month, which would be interesting to see, but maybe that'd be 10-20% of all the coinjoin transactions I identified?  
Nevertheless this means either
1. Wasabi wasn't the driver of the latest CJ surge.
2. The data is flawed, because it has too many false positives.
The interesting thing is that even if the data is flawed, indistinguishable outputs have been created, so that throws off blockchain analysis nevertheless:)

However excuse me to doubt you, but I reviewed literally all research on how to privately retrive info from the blockchain and there is no way to do this without near full node requirements. At least not one that's implemented and doesn't compromise security at some degree.

We were thinking about it, but we deviated enough from ZeroLink to not try to do such large changes without proper review. It seems like dividing the change to 0.1BTC outputs right away would be good, but there are some (non-?)issues, like what if you mix with a big guy and you're enjoying your huge anonset, until the bigguy just bails out and consolidates everything where your anonset zeros out. Not sure if this and similar things are actual issues, but I'm a bit more afraid to get into these without doing some proper research.

I am not a fan of religions, but someone joins ISIS, because the US bombed his hometown, his friends and family are killed, the religion thing is just a proxy. They'd do the same without religion, because the real reason is their loved ones dying.  
  
It is also naive to think the US is fighting its wars because of some principle.  
  
Also Amir didn't go to figh ISIS, he wanted to help Rojova build the anarchist society he always dreamed of.

As you could see from my blog post I concentrate on the privacy aspect. Even if committed bloom filters allow higher security it still doesn't solve the inherent privacy leak of bloom filters. Even with never changing one.  
The subgrapth traversal seems to me always be an issue here.  
The thing is even if you are using Core, with clustering strategies they can reestabilish our wallet's transactions and addresses with various success.  
If their crawler catches our bloom filter then they can easily see which addresses of an identified wallet fall outside of the bloom filter so further improve their guesses.  
It's not theoreticalt, this is what Nick Jonas did for example with scary results.

To be fair he'd have been stupid not to play the market. And all signs point to he did. I bought some Litecoin a while ago expecting segwit will be activated. But later it turned out it wont. Then the price skyrocketed for no reason. I sold because segwit still didnt seem to get activated on ltc. Then the guy announced he'll start mining segwit blocks. So litecoin continued its rally.  
It looks painfully clear he and his friends were the ones who bought the pre announcement rally.  
One might find it even hypocritical to say he has no litecoin when he probably just sold his holdings a minute before his bitching.

Some poeple are still looking at committed bloom filters, I don't anymore. I found it above my level.   
What I described there is different, it relies on a trusted full node to be sure a transaction happened. It of course a bad alternative to Core wallet or SPV wallets (altough it's debateable which one has higher chance: the company who runs the trusted full node will tick the users or an SPV wallet gets tricked by anon peers).  
However my proposed scheme would be advised to considered by frankly 90% of all existing wallets, since they arleady rely on trusted full nodes. If the block size doesn't get out of hand it'll work pretty well.

I'm not sure how that would work. Also I am not sure about the question, are you asking for if I'll  build "coinjoin master nodes", or if I'll allow anyone to run a coordinator.  
If it's the latter, there's no need to allow anything, Wasabi is a free software. Free as libre, not free as the price. Anyone can fork off and do whatever they wish with it. That being said, I am not sure writing a step by step tutorial for our competitors would be the best use of our time:)

I don't really know what that means, but I suspect it is. I imagine that you create another Bitcoin account on your ledger. That'll send Wasabi a different master fingerprint than your first account, so Wasabi will create a new wallet file for that automatically, so Wasabi will think "hey, it's a different Ledger was plugged in, not what you plugged in previously."

You are right, but there's one thing I'd like to note: How would the exchange know that it's your Wasabi wallet or someone elses? (Sadly) most people use exchanges as their main wallets, so it can go both way. There's really no way to know if Wasabi is your or someone else's wallet.

You might want to check out this discussion: [Questions: Wasabi with trezor-secured funds](
TLDR: When you leave Wasabi things get problematic unless you use a full node with coin control.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:49:34


The problem is no wallet can decide what inputs to join together. For example if you want to pay your taxes and you have 3 outputs and 2 must be joined the wallet cannot decide by itself based on blockchain information. There needs to be human input, so you won't pay your taxes from the output you got from a shady exchange trading altcoins.
Also if you are giving some money gift you'd better avoid joining inputs and generating change altogether.
You can do it with coin control today in Electrum/Core or HiddenWallet, my idea is it's more intuitive to use a fully visualized wallet than learning proper use of coin control. I may be wrong, but one can only know if it's implemented.

Yes, this is an issue. There is one difference though. It is a trustless central point of failure and the code cannot be unwritten, thus if someone shuts us down, anyone will be able to do the exact same thing we're doing, they don't even have to give their name to it. We do, because what we are doing is legal, and it is easier to move forward when you don't need to hide, think about the sheer amount of time wasting just by waiting for websites to load when you are over Tor would make me being only half way into this journey. Anyway, this is an issue I want to work on, but only after we've explored and implemented the best privacy that is theoretically possible the current Bitcoin protocol.

There is a difference between releasing source code and conducting open source development with Git on GitHub. I've participated and contributed to .NET Core myself a couple of times, too and the code got into the next release.
Scientists are building on top of each other's works for decades and from that my part is Wasabi. I don't know how to reinvent a the lightbulb. Similarly I don't go down to framework level, nor OS level, nor hardware level of verifying and reviewing everything. It is impractical, I acknowledge that I live in the real world. You are however free to:
1. Prove your accusation and check if the source matches the release.
2. Build .NET Core from source, build Git from source code, build Tor from source code and use Wasabi with this. Actually none of those steps are that difficult. In fact, I paid special attention to the latter (since that is my part) to make this part easy and many people are using it that way already.

Such project seems to make sense for me to pump and to achieve some quantum cryptographer orgasm. These are not good enough reasons for me, when considering the cons:  
   
1. Bitcoin is already quantum resistant today, the only thing QC can do is steal early bitcoins.  
2. On a conceptual level QRL trying to build a ledger based on early QC assumptions. However, as Benedikt noted, all we know about post-quantum cryptography is that we don't know very little and the field is rapidly changing.
So building a blockchain to defend against all today's hypothetical post-quantum crypto assumptions, while these assumptions are changing rapidly doesn't make sense. Especially if you consider how hard it is to get any change done in blockchains.
3. All the general arguments against altcoins, such as network effect, less stable store of value, etc...

Ok, so how can I put the next sentence of mine in a way that you don’t give up all your hope and turn away disgusted without reading to the end.  
I am a .NET developer, I use Windows and I love Microsoft. If you think that it is an anomaly that I am also passionate about privacy and open source (rather about free software) then you may want to revisit your personal biases. There is a rapidly growing open source and cross platform movement at Microsoft, that today got to the point that the single biggest open source contributor on GitHub is MS, hence the acquisition.  
...  
The way I see it is this: Linux wizards and .NET geeks are in the same boat fighting against the walled gardens of Apple, Google, and Microsoft! Microsoft needs more developers with passion for free software and Linux wizards need to keep bashing the remaining bad side of Microsoft. That’s the easy part of it. But they also need to embrace the new, rapidly growing good side of it, or at least not shit on something like the above tweet.

The issue is that, wallets are supporting hardware wallets, but for coinjoins this might should be the other way around.

Actually Samourai is great for that. Wasabi is great for providing mathematically provable anonymity: 


That is correct. However they don't do that today (that is not to say they won't do that tomorrow)
There are a number of reasons why this kind of blacklisting is problematic in practice, but take it with a grain of salt, because I'm the creator of Wasabi,  so I am biased.
 - [This Elliptic report]( identifies 0.65% of all Bitcoin transactions are mixing transactions. This means, if that kind of blacklisting would happen, they would have to blacklist most bitcoins in existence.  
 - The same report also states, 50% of DNM users don't use any mixing, but directly send to exchanges (mind blowing, I know) and these are the coins being blacklisted.  
 - From another point of view, Wasabi's anonymity set will be constant 100, and if a coin from it is tainted, would they really blacklist all mixed coins, where every coin has exactly 1% chance of being the tainted one? 
 - The user base of [Traditional Bitcoin Mixers]( is limited to a certain type of user, who is in desperate need of privacy and in order to get it, he is willing to risk losing money. Since coin loss, and other issues are architecturally impossible with Wasabi, our target user is not limited to them, the target user of Wasabi Wallet is everyone, because everyone needs privacy.
 - If someone is extremely paranoid, he can just spend coins to himself a couple of times before sending it to the desired "legitimate" place. This is what Samourai's [Ricochet]( is doing.
 - Speaking of legitimacy, zkSNACKs, the company behind Wasabi is a legitimate company. Privacy is not only not a crime, but a fundamental human right and if an entity would blacklist a mix output, they would be looking ahead of legal trouble. If such a thing would ever happen, please notify us.

When a developer starts building a wallet, first it is thinking in addresses and balances. He'll fail and build a lot of bad things. Then he realizes the basic building block should be a "transaction" and everything starts to make sense and work.  
The third phase is when he realizes instead of transactions, he should consider transaction outputs and magically everything starts to make even more sense.  
As you can see from the code I added such transaction output can be represented with a SmartCoin object, where the label is the only metadata.

We set up a company to make sure everything is 100% clean and legal: zkSNACKs Ltd.  
We have in our terms and conditions that the user cannot do anything illegal with this software. This is an unbreakable secret bond between users and creators.
Because we made sure everything is 100% legal, the only thing we have to pay attention to not accidentally step on someone's foot who's above the law. If we can do that, we are good.

This is a good point, however I would argue this is not a typical user behavior pattern, I was always very careful with my words to communicate that Wasabi should be used as a general purpose post-mix wallet, because withdrawing to any wallet of yours that is not a full node with coin control can be a mistake depending on your threat model. 


I'd argue the timing issue here is minor compared to the other issue: when the user withdraws to a light wallet, then he leaks all its addresses to a third party, and if Tor is not used with that light wallet your IP address is going with it, too.
The ultimate solution would be to [provide hardware wallet integration and smartphone app,]( so the user wouldn't even have to do things like this in the first place.

I think the bottle neck is: how long does it take to mix your desired amount. There's no need to keep coins in the wallet for waiting (not sure if that's what you are referring to) if you're going to move them to a hardware wallet anyway. I'd say just move them whenever it is the most convenient time for you personally.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:56:37
Nor the change output of the tx that was spent and resulted the DN tx change. And so on. So you'd have to need a long coin history.  
Labeling with clever data visualization. Or push through Confidential Transactions with core devs and make all tx CT with CoinJoin so no need to deal with any of these shit:)

@_date: 2018-11-01 22:10:02


A active CoinJoin output and B active CoinJoin output are indistinguishable from each other. They are by definition: fungible.




 - [This Elliptic report]( identifies 0.65% of all Bitcoin transactions are mixing transactions. This means, if that kind of blacklisting would happen, they would have to blacklist most bitcoins in existence.  
 - The same report also states, 50% of DNM users don't use any mixing, but directly send to exchanges (mind blowing, I know) and these are the coins being blacklisted.  
 - From another point of view, Wasabi's anonymity set will be constant 100, and if a coin from it is tainted, would they really blacklist all mixed coins, where every coin has exactly 1% chance of being the tainted one? 
 - The user base of [Traditional Bitcoin Mixers]( is limited to a certain type of user, who is in desperate need of privacy and in order to get it, he is willing to risk losing money. Since coin loss, and other issues are architecturally impossible with Wasabi, our target user is not limited to them, the target user of Wasabi Wallet is everyone, because everyone needs privacy.
 - If someone is extremely paranoid, he can just spend coins to himself a couple of times before sending it to the desired "legitimate" place. This is what Samourai's [Ricochet]( is doing.

Interestingly [we will support]( Schnorr Signatures in a week or two. We replaced our Chaumian Blinding with Schnorr Signature Blinding and we'll roll it out in our next release. But I know that's not what you meant:)
So, Schnorr makes coinjoins 30% cheaper, which is awesome. However it is interactive. Right now, clients can sign separately a transaction and the coordinator can combine all the signatures.  
With schnorr clients would have to sign on top of each other's signatures, one by one. This poses additional challenges. I have a "competing protocol" in mind, that might be optimal.  
To answer you question, we would love to support it right away, but unfortunately considerable amount of code must be changed, because it not a simple plug and play and at this point in time estimating that how long it will take may be immature.

It's almost the lowest priority. We are using Bitcoin Core's RPC `estimatesmartfee CONSERVATIVE 1008`. This means, CJ should confirm within 7 days. Of course today the mempool is pretty low, so they confirm within a few hours. We're not married to this fee estimation, but it "seems to be sufficient" for most people. We'll revisit this topic when necessary. Later on, we could implement a system where one could choose what fee round it wants to be, but the liquidity is not there yet. Do you have a suggestion how should we do this? Note that every participant must come to consensus on the fees.

@_date: 2019-01-26 10:20:47
On the first glance it looks like remixing provides exponential anonymity set, for example, you mix once, the probability of that the coin came from you is 1/50, you remix and now it's 1/(50*50). Thus if you remix only once, your anonymity set jumps to 2500. Now that's a naive math, there are much more variables those ruin that crazy high number, it gets messy real quick.  
In the wallet we just aggregate the anonymity set for on remixing for now, but I suspect remixing is much more valuable than that, it's just hard to tell.  
Hard to tell, but not impossible. We have an issue opened on how to improve the anonymity set feedback, and I think we can make it quite accurate later, it's just working on this feedback is not our main focus atm.

Of course the change addresses are not anonymized, that's why they are called change addresses, that's why they come back to your wallet from the mix with a big red shield. The bot simply points out to this while using words like "uuh" or "jaay" to mislead people.

As said, just multiply your result with 41, because your result applies to only one participant: `0.00012BTC`.  
So that'd be `0.00492BTC`, and suddenly your `0.002-0.005BTC` range not only makes more sense, but also becomes more attractive, isn't it?:)  
Why it's not constant, is because we must mess with the fees in various ways to throw out equal outputs when the input amounts are close to each other, otherwise the links could be subset-sum analyzable.

No matter how good your mixing technique is, if the wallet around it doesn't care about your privacy, you are going to lose it. That's the reason why ZeroLink was created. It's a wallet privacy framework above all. While it provides a mixing technique, too, which is called Chaumian CoinJoin, ZeroLink can work together with any other round based mixing technique (CoinShuffle, TumbleBit, Xim, etc...).


Again, the question is what kind of ecosystem is built around the mixing technology. ZeroLink has strict requirements, so no privacy loss can happen. It's a standard, a social agreement, that you don't build a privacy degrading product that uses the same mixing technique. For example, if Blockchain.info would decide to connect to HiddenWallet's mixing rounds, then HiddenWallet users would be fucked, too. Monero has similar problems having MyMonero mixing with full node users. That being said, I did quite a lot of investigation and figured MyMonero doesn't pose any privacy risk currently to the ecosystem, but the point is. It's more likely that inprivate stuff will be built on top of the base layer in the name of convenience, than someone build an inprivate service for an already operating privacy tech.  
Interestingly this is the reason why Dash's privacy is considered to be weak. Even if you do a round of mixing, that transaction is not living in a vacuum. When network analysis or transaction chains are examined, Dash very quickly loses its privacy. Anyway, I guess that's better than nothing.

Coinjoins require signing when you are AFK. So that makes proper HW integration pretty damn hard to impossible. In fact, this should probably be have to be done the other way around.

Actually we know the exact opposite today. Of course it is no guarantee for the future.
There are a number of reasons why this kind of blacklisting is problematic in practice, but take it with a grain of salt, because I'm the creator of Wasabi,  so I am biased.
 - [This Elliptic report]( identifies 0.65% of all Bitcoin transactions are mixing transactions. This means, if that kind of blacklisting would happen, they would have to blacklist most bitcoins in existence.  
 - The same report also states, 50% of DNM users don't use any mixing, but directly send to exchanges (mind blowing, I know) and these are the coins being blacklisted.  
 - From another point of view, Wasabi's anonymity set will be constant 100, and if a coin from it is tainted, would they really blacklist all mixed coins, where every coin has exactly 1% chance of being the tainted one? 
 - The user base of [Traditional Bitcoin Mixers]( is limited to a certain type of user, who is in desperate need of privacy and in order to get it, he is willing to risk losing money. Since coin loss, and other issues are architecturally impossible with Wasabi, our target user is not limited to them, the target user of Wasabi Wallet is everyone, because everyone needs privacy.
 - If someone is extremely paranoid, he can just spend coins to himself a couple of times before sending it to the desired "legitimate" place. This is what Samourai's [Ricochet]( is doing.
 - Speaking of legitimacy, zkSNACKs, the company behind Wasabi is a legitimate company. Privacy is not only not a crime, but a fundamental human right and if an entity would blacklist a mix output, they would be looking ahead of legal trouble. If such a thing would ever happen, please notify us.

How many time do you transact a day? 10?

Because in JoinMarket you're paying to get the exact amount you want to send quickly. In this Wasabi-JM mix you would only pay for the speed, but you wouldn't be able to mess with the amount, because of the trustless nature of the mix - in Wasabi nobody can map the links. In JoinMarket, anyone who participates can map the links.


I mean, in JoinMarket you are mixing to other people. Your transaction is a mix in itself. In Wasabi you're mixing to yourself.

**TLDR.:** Not anytime soon.
From a timing point of view there is a [tremendous amount]( of improvements those can make make privacy in Bitcoin cheaper, faster, more convenient and more intuitive. New systems and features tend to carve old features and architectures in stone, so it would be more efficient to do porting to mobile after we cannot do anything meaningful anymore.
From a technological point of view, there are some practical issues building a privacy wallet to smartphones.  
The main issue that is blocking us right now is light wallet privacy on the network level. The only light wallet architecture that does not leak the links between your addresses is [BIP157]( (Client Side Filtering, Neutrino.) These filters that the clients download are if over 1GB. For now, we are cheating here, because Wasabi is a bech32-only wallet, so we only build filters from bech32 addresses, thus our wallet can still feel as a light wallet on desktop, but as bech32 adoption grows we'll even have scaling issues on desktop without additional code optimization, which is possible it's just a lot of hard work and we don't have unlimited resources. Another issue with this is the network usage. After a a wallet gets the filters, it downloads full blocks from Bitcoin nodes, which are ok on desktops, but on mobile, network resource should not be taken lightly. Finally, coinjoins are bloating wallets with addresses, which results in a lot of CPU usage, which in desktop is insignificant, but on mobile battery is scarce. Sure there are many ways to solve these, too, but they are more like compromises than solutions and **the path to a bad software is filled with compromises.**  
Finally Tor. Tor is an anonymity network Wasabi cannot be used without. This adds humongous amount on friction even to desktop development, on untested mobile platforms I can imagine so many things go wrong.  
And these are only the existing features. What complications can we expect if we add Lightning?  
Fortunately smartphones are also improving quickly, so not everything is lost.  
I also hope Samourai will be implemented to iOS and grows itself out of Beta by the time we even get there to consider creating a mobile wallet.


I am most excited about Lightning Network and privacy improvements. I most worried that the mainstream to pour in before we make this two crucial fronts of Bitcoin strong enough.

Ideal mixing would be to not enqueue individual coins those are smaller than the denomination at all, but rather give us time to figure out how to handle those small coins properly or donate them to somewhere.  
Also do remix once or twice, remixes are perfect mixes,  they don't generate change, so they , so they are more valuable than standard mixes.


We are constantly increasing the anonymity set. We didn't start out at 41:) We will soon however roll out a [basic unequal input mixing,]( which will increase the efficiency of mixing (anonymity gained/blockspace used), but because of this it might slow the rounds down, we are not sure, that's why we're not trying to mess with it in the finish line, although an increase would be due.

Yes, something like that, today you would be receiving 2% of that bad event X coin. If you remix the coin again then you'd technically own `1/(41*41)=` 0.0005% of that X bad event coin.

makes the agent doing the spend linkable to the agent who 
earlier recieved the coin, so these transactions are linkable. 
In order to counteract this, the owner of the coin needs to 
make a transaction, indistinguishable to others from any 
normal transaction, in which he creates a new key pair and 
transfers the coin to its posessor (ie, has one sock puppet 
"spend" it to another). No change in real-world identity of 
the owner, but the transaction "linkable" to the agent who spent 
the coin is unlinked. For category-three unlinkability, this 
has to be done a random number of times - maybe one to six 
times?

If I'm right you are one of the developer working on this, so brace yourself, I will go deep here.
We are using client side filtering where the filters are downloaded from our server and blocks are downloaded from random Bitcoin nodes.
You can make the request by yourself:
bestHeight: 557488,
filters: [
There is one more trick. Wasabi is bech32-only wallet, thus we only build filters regarding bech32 addresses. I know it won't scale in the long term, but we have some years to optimize before it becomes an issue.
A more elaborate description of our validation algorithm is as follows:
1. First a Server creates an `index`. This `index` contains `block hash` and `Golomb-Rice filter` pairs.  
2. Clients download this `index` over Tor.  
3. A Client from the index figures out which `blocks` it is interested in (there are false positives.)  
4. The Client asks random Bitcoin Nodes for blocks: one `block` - one Node, over the clearnet.  
5. The Client verifies the downloaded `block hash` matches to the already known `block hash` (downloaded from the Server in step 2.) and validates the `block`.

Yes. I spent almost a week of nerve wracking, meticulous selling all my BCH UTXOs at the time. One by one, over new Tor circuit each, over ShapeShift.  
Then I accidentally consolidated all, because I assumed when you select many coins in Bitcoin Core, it'll conduct a coin selection algorithm to select the most reasonable inputs, but instead it joined them together.  
This begs for a question: if the so called "privacy expert" cannot preserve its privacy during a fork, then who can?
We clearly have a long way to go...
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:09:32
**What we have today is:**
It really depends on your threat model. For example if your adversary is the NSA, then you'd better not expose common ownership of small coins in a mix at all.  
Otherwise you can look at your coin history. If you see two labels in the coin history you would avoid exposing common ownership of, then that's the clue.  
**What we can have in the long term:**
I think we can make it more intuitive what the user should and should not do, but my hope is that we will
1. Research [unequal input mixing,](
2. [Mixing to others]( instead of mixing to self,
3. gain enough liquidity so to be able to execute such mixing in a timely manner, so it could replace the traditional Send button altogether.

While I yet to do my homework on LN, even I can point out great concerns those are also "key differences" and in fact in this thread those very things were pointed out and discussed. I was expecting more from you than this one sided comment.  
1. **[UTXO vs Balance model.]( The very thing that makes Ethereum especially shitty from a privacy point of view is reintroduced in the Lightning Network, of course this time it was done with good reason.  
2. **Transparency.** Here comes your counter argument, that "Ok, but unlike in ETH the ledger is not public." But for that, the problem is, the ledger is not private either. It's not like in [Chaumian's e-cash]( that peers are forwarding payments directly to each other, achieving unprecedented fungibility, rather the payments must find routes. 
3. **Confidentality.** In this case LN is more comparable to the traditional banking system's privacy, which contrary to the popular belief in many ways much better than a cryptocurrency's fungibility, you will never know anything about the financials of your neighbor or the owner of the corner store, while in cryptos, you only need to make one transaction with them and without any blockchain analysis, you'll likely have a decent idea. The traditional banking privacy model fails when governments abuse it, which is pretty much always the case. Even if you don't agree with that, because you live in the US, you must admit a great part of the world does abuse it, like North Korea or China (who'll save us from WeChat Pay? Try opening a donation account for the children lost their parents after Tiananmen Square.)  
So P2P currencies are better against government privacy abuse, but traditional banking is better against individual privacy abuse (eg. Bitcoin kidnapping is indeed more likely in the Bitcoin world, than in the legacy world.) However LN indeed improves upon it, because while you cannot choose your bank you can choose your LN route. But this will only be true if LN will be reasonably decentralized. Which, no matter what anyone say, it is impossible to make predictions about at this point. Usage patterns of 1,000 hardcore extremely tech savvy Bitcoiners is just not representative. This was the expanded version of how I came to the conclusion in the previous comment: **"In the end it all comes down to if LN will be reasonable decentralized or not."**   
4. **Unverifiable Privacy.** This brings back to my first comment, which was about LN's unverifiable privacy. While in cryptos Bitcoin can provide mathematically provable privacy with an anonymity set, in LN you'll always depend on the honesty of the hubs. Which again why I said "LN in general will make the everything much more private," privacy based on trust of honesty in a decentralized system not that bad as it sounds in this community, where trust is a course word. In fact, most (if not all) anonymity networks, like Tor depends on honest nodes. And here comes in the picture LN's onion routing. In order to that to not be useless, just like Tor, LN depends on sufficient number of honest nodes, which again reasonable decentralization can make it possible.  
6. **Usage Patterns.** If today everyone would use Bitcoin it'd be a terrible world. We are making much less payments in BTC, than in fiat and yet we still leave a bunch of tracks. However in the future we will make 1% of our payments on chain and 99% of our payments on LN (or something like that.) Thus we'll leave much more tracks on LN.  
Anyway, I realize it was a bit ranty and I apologize for that, but that oversimplified comment of yours just contributed to the terribly long list of misinformation being spread about LN. So please let's build systems with complete intellectual honesty and do our best to not misinform those who are not as deeply involved.

[Yes, we do.](  
As I've noted in that post I envision the ultimate Pay to EndPoint in a way that the user wouldn't even have to be aware that he is using Pay to EndPoint in the first place. For this the requirement would be to have a dedicated anonymity network work in the background that your wallet could check against the address you received and if at any point someone is listening on the other end, then you make your transaction in a trustless manner.
Dreaming aside, current implementations and implementation plans of P2EP is nowhere near as ambitious and from this Wasabi's plans aren't exempt either.  
In Wasabi we have an advantage that all of our users are using Tor in the background, so we could just set up a hidden service they're listening on and our users could add their friends by adding the onion endpoint and communicate there.  
1. At first it could be a simple P2P, end-to-end encrypted chat client that can be used mainly to securely transfer Bitcoin addresses.  
2. Later they could use this to send each other while facilitating merge avoidance.
3. Then send each other by using P2EEP sender-receiver scheme.
5. Finally send to other people, outside of Wasabi while doing a 2 of 2 coinjoin.  
This is how I see it play out, the beauty of this that after you added someone you don't even need to be aware of anything, everything can happen automatically in the background.
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:17:58

@_date: 2019-01-31 08:16:31
Let's think it through together what would we have to do as the Tumbler to deanonymize 0.1BTC, mixed exactly once with the current parameters: 59 peer needed. (If the Tumbler would lower it to small, then the coin would be remixed, since 2 anonset coin would only be ok for those who don't care., so it wouldn't make sense.)
We can choose a Bitcoin address and wait until it gets registered to the mix. When this happens, kick out all the other alices and provide 59 inputs.  
Now for this we need to mix 58 inputs to not be noticeable that the 58 input comes from the same source. Wait, but if all 58 input is a remix then that's also suspicious of something going wrong. So what can we do then? Well, let's mix 58*10*0.1BTC and merge them to random chunks, remix about 30-50% half of the times (that's the remix ratio today,) make random amount of tansactions with the rest and wait for our 0.1BTC victim.  
While this still can be noticeable, this is likely to go under the radar for a long time, since while previous attempts to hide it are noticeable in an obvious way.  
I guess I leave it to you to determine the feasibility of this and make your own conclusions.

Privacy must always be made sure in the highest layer, which directly interacts with the user.
If you build a web wallet, a bank or an exchange on top of the most anonymous altcoin in the world: cash, then the base layer's privacy does not matter that much.  
On the contrary, if you consider the banking system to be the base layer and withdrawing the cash, then conducting a hand-to-hand exchange (mixing), then the privacy breaching base layer is not that much of an issue anymore.  
That being said, building more privacy to the base layer makes building privacy to higher layers easier, which is important.
Unfortunately there are many things I don't understand, so I would refrain from selfishly pushing my privacy improvements into Core developers. They have to balance stability, decentralization, security and privacy, which is quite a job.

It varies from -0.1% to 1%, since equal outputs must be created.  
This -0.1% to 1% output equality optimization happens when someone comes in the mix with `0.0984-0.099384`btc, assuming 0.0984 denomination.
(Yes, sometimes coinjoins even pays you, because at registration time network fees are highballed and at coinjoin time network fees are lowballed and the remaining is split between the mixed outputs.)  
Fees are paid 0.003% per anonymity set, which would be 0.3% for 100 people, which is our target, when reached the anonset won't increase further (Bitcoin network limitations.)  Currently it's 57 anonset rounds, so the target coordinator fee is 0.003*57, which is 0.17%. While it can of course go up to 1%, we recently calculated that we take on average 20% less than our target coordinator fee (
Btw I get shit for it quite often from some people within the company, but I think they understood now that why this variability is there.  
For example take a look at my past 50ish mixes (I clipped the last few digits and grayed out the non-cj transactions to not dox myself.) 
As you can see, I only come close to `.009` figure with a `.006` figure when I came to the mix with larger amount.  The 4 green is when the coinjoin paid me a few satoshis, the rest was all under `.000x`. That being said I'm often remixing, so that can be one reason why I pay almost nothing. (Remixes rarely have enough to cover the coordinator fee, so in this case it's not charged for.)  
It can only go up to 1% if the change would be smaller than 1% of the base denomination (0.0984..) so that's added to the coordinator fees to not generate a new few satoshi output that could only be used to deanonymize you by later you exposing common ownership.

In theory, Wasabi could support smart phones (Android, iOS). In practice, these platforms and their tools are not mature enough just yet. The concept of network analysis resistant smartphone wallets are not yet proven. If we would try to port Wasabi's code, the wallet would use too much disk space, battery and network today. Another implementation issue comes from Wasabi's reliance on Tor, which adds another layer of friction. While, in desktop we succeeded to work around nearly all the reliability issues of the anonymity network, the current state of Tor on mobile platforms may pose additional challenges.  
However, tech is improving quickly, thus timing has special importance on this matter.

So, it'd be like some users would register mixing, but wouldn't pay or would take fee, but other users would register mixing, but would pay for users who don't want to pay to activate themselves thus make their mixing faster?
Sounds doable actually. It'd could be like JoinMarket, but instead of direct transactions, these would be self-mixing transactions as always.  
That being said, if you take a look at the graph in my article, it would suffer from the same scaling issues due to Bitcoin network fees as JoinMarket does, or even worse, since in Wasabi you'd have to pay until the round is filled and you wouldn't even mix everything, like in JoinMarket, only a small portion of it.  
Hmm... maybe it'd be just a slow and expensive JoinMarket. Nevertheless this is the first time someone succeeded to breach the gap between JM's idea and a round based mixing technique, so that's quite something, even if I think it wouldn't be feasible in the long run.

In fact it's much more effective to use JM with the `tumbler.py` (that's a bit time consuming though.) Note: I don't know if ChipMixer is legitimate or not, but that's the only one I know of that uses denominations, which are too small IMO, but better than nothing.

I'm thinking of this:
1. tumbler builds unsigned tx, gives it out to everyone
2. the fastest signature sent back will be broadcasted to everyone again
3. the fastest signature sent back on top of the first sig will be broadcasted to everyone again
And so on until the tx is ready...  
I don't think it's possible to do more optimal than this.

Look at the utility Tor provides, instead of sticking with some dogma.  
You donwload all transactions and estabilish your balances based on your local utxo set. Therefore linking together your wallet addresses by network analysis doesn't work.  
Dandelion fixes transaction broadcasting in a way more secure way than Tor, therefore linking your IP to a transaction does not work.  
So it will all come down to this question: would you rather let third parties know that (1) you use Bitcoin or (2) you use Tor? While keeping in mind Tor increases syncing times dramatically.

I had the idea that why don't we just divide all coins to 0.1BTC chunks in the coinjoin, from the beginning?  
If someone has 18BTC and he makes his BTC divided to 0.1BTC outputs, while he didn't gain much anonymity, everyone else did gain a ton. Further remixes will provide the anonymity for the 18BTC guy and those will even be perfect mixes.
I don't see the downside, other than that I feel extremely stupid for not thinking about it before.

I believe every transaction deserves privacy. You are implying that the usage of Monero is preferred if I am doing shady things. I don't. I always want privacy. Regardless the practicality of it, Monero is not anonymous enough to do shady things. It has tiny anonymity set (6ish) and the recognizable user patterns further lower this anonymity set.  
Yet Monero may evolve to provide strong privacy in the future, but its scaling properties are terrible, so even if it has the potential to win big, it also has the potential to fail big. Nevertheless today it's not ready.

It downloads all transactions and estabilishes the wallet balance locally. While every other wallet estabilishes wallet balances in a way that it exposes its wallet addresses to third parties.

**TLDR:** 80% is the correct number, but as I suspected Monero doesn't leverages Bulletproofs' aggregation property, other than up to 2 outputs, ergo in Monero the transaction size grows with the anonymity set, while in CoinJoin the transaction size stays pretty much the same as the anonymity set grows.  
**Starting to investigate your linked article:**
The calculations has nothing to do with the Monero bulletproof calculations. It simply takes 80% number from [another article]( as a given and bases the following calculations on that. I still don't understand how that number is get.  
So what does the other article says?


This article references the [bulletproofs whitepaper]( as source, so now we must see what it says. It's quite an investigative journey already:)






Now what I notice instantly is Monero transactions are 13kB, but the bulletproofs paper cites 5.5kB as the current implementations of CT. If I'm right here, this means Monero transactions are using 2 CT outputs, which would be about 11kB proof + 2kB whatever = 13kB.  
If we consider Bulletproofs aggregation property then indeed Monero can gain 50% instantly by every transaction. I'm cannot find Bulletproofs' improvement upon single proof, but from 5.5kB to 2.5kB sounds just about right.  
So yes, the 80% seems to be is a fair number.  
However it must be mentioned that as I suspected Monero does not leverages the aggregation property of Bulletproofs, other than up to 2 outputs (1 active and one change.)  
So if you build a coinjoin with 100 outputs, it'll still have a 2.5kB proof, (a little more but nevermind).  
But if you create a transaction with ring size 100 (I know unrealistic, but oh well, then that will still be 250kB.)

You can find a nice comparison between SNARKs, STARKs and Bulletproofs here: 


Since 2013 we have every research we need for close perfect privacy in Bitcoin. The problem is, we don't have many devs who implement these features, because working on privacy has an inherent flaw: you cannot make money from it. If you do, you are going to jail sooner or later, so devs don't see the potential to build and implement systems. A few example is JoinMarket, which with today's fees is getting uneconomical, Bitcoin mixers, where flawed concepts are implemented to get a quick buck, and altcoins, where the price appretiation is the revenue.


No it's not. Not for Bitcoin. It's not scalable, restrictive, underresearched and its anonymity set is tiny, and user patterns are a huge issue is further lowering it.


Yeah, in the very long term. We need a couple of Maxwell to create an acceptable version of it though.

Ironically most of the legendary engineers and programmers you see in the media doesn't do much engineering, they tend to acquire more human skills to inspire/motivate/organize engineers, because at that influence level they can make a bigger impact this way.  
A prime example is Steve Wozniak or Adam Back.  
Counter examples are Pieter Wuille and Nick Szabo. Another person in transition period would be Gregory Maxwell, but guess what he did? He quits Blockstream to push himself back to researcher mode.  
Gavin made the move to become a thought leader, but he failed. He gained a following of non-engineers by capitalizing on his "Core developer" title, which is fine, but he tried to push other engineers under the bus in a sneaky way. Before Roger Ver started to make waves not one Core developer told me: "I think Gavin is pulling the strings from safe distance." One cannot capitalize on his "Core developer" title among Core developers if he doesn't contribute. In fact it is quite dishonest, since he was eating the fruits of their work. If you don't actually work on anything for years, then don't try to force those who do your way. You are not going to be an authority among those who are actually getting shit done.

While LN in general will make the everything much more private if, and only if LN will be decentralized to a reasonable degree. The problem in Lightning's privacy is that you will never get verifiable privacy, you will know you lost your privacy only when it's too late, or maybe not even then. Schrödinger's cat. Though second layer privacy solutions can improve upon this, but I'm not aware of anyone thinking about this or if the concept even makes sense.

Yes, please. I always wanted to discuss my concerns point by point. I divided my points into short and long term effects of every specific concern I bring up. By short term I mean: if it is a problem today, by the long term I mean if it will be potentially a problem in the future. Bear in mind, I am far from being an expert in Monero, but I understand well the theories behind the concepts.  
 1. Transaction Propagation
**Summary.** I don't know much about Monero's transaction propagation, but I know if it is not done right, for example it is done in the Bitcoin way, it is a problem. I would like you to educate me on this. In Bitcoin we can use Tor with circuit changes, or potentially any other anonymity network, like I2P. There is also a proposal, called [Dandelion]( that removes the need of this anonymity network. What does Monero do to fix the private transaction propagation issue?
**Short term.** If nothing, this is an issue.  
**Long term.** It is not an issue, since there are clean ways to solve this.
 2. Network analysis. 
**Summary.** Private transaction retrieval is quite a challenge. If you use MyMonero, then you don't have privacy against the service, because MyMonero knows everything about you. But privacy is teamwork, if some of your peers those are part of the anonymity set of loses privacy, then your anonymity set gets lower, too (silently.) The "only" sure way to fix this is to use a full node, download all the transactions the network has, so nobody knows which transactions you are interested in. I guess you understand where I'm heading to with this: the bigger the blocks are, the biggest this challenge is, and Monero's inherent scalability issues are not ideal for this.  
There are other ways to solve this issue, though I didn't see a good solution implemented yet. Bloom filtering SPV wallets [turned out to be a catastrophe] from privacy a privacy point of view. Nobody really thought through Lightning labs' Neutrino from a privacy point of view, although it seems fine. Full SPV wallets are still almost as cumbersome as a full node. Other things are only exists in idea level.   
**Short term.** MyMonero conducts 5-7% of all Monero transactions, so it's not an issue today. 30-60% of the network is using trusted full nodes, which are terribly under researched, yet I doubt they'd be exploited today so it's also not an issue and the rest is full nodes.
**Long term.** This can go two way. It's possible that trusted full node solution will be ruined. It's possible that as Monero goes more and more mainstream, like Bitcoin MyMonero like services and light mobile wallets take over the market. However it's also possible that the Monero community implements some proper light weight solution.
 3. Scalability
**Summary.** Monero uses RingCT today. A Bitcoin transaction is 200 bytes, a Monero transaction is 13,000 bytes. That is 65 times larger. An 84% decrease with Bulletproofs would result in 9.1 times larger transactions. 9 times worse scalability is a terrible scalability. Note, I took your 84% value, I did not look into it.  
But the main problem with your logic is that Monero doesn't often CoinJoin, where the main advantage of Bulletproofs shine: aggregating the proof.
**Short term.** Monero blockchain will continue to grow. Yet it's not unbearably large now, so in the short term it's not an issue. 
**Long term.** Bulletpoofs won't help too much, unless there is a clever trick I don't know about to use the aggregation property or Monero people start using CoinJoin, I think that is possible. 
Let us assume Monero is able to utilize the best of Bulletproofs somehow. Worst case scenario with coinjoins. In this case transactions will still be 9 times larger. This actually corresponds to the pre-CT transaction sizes: 2,000 bytes.
 4. Stealth addresses
**Summary.** Cookie meets the blockchain. Recently more and more attack and research was on this topic. Combining web data with blockchain data. See the [BlockSci guy's]( research or [Bitfury's research](
Of course they had been done on Bitcoin, nevertheless Bitcoin is using addresses and address reuse avoidance is encouraged, where Monero is abstracting such concept away with stealth addresses, so one person usually have one or two stealth address that he's sharing with everyone. Therefore Monero is much more susceptible to this kind of attacks.
**Short term.** Nobody is reasearching or attacking Monero through this method, as far as I know. So it's not an issue.
**Long term.** There are ways to overcome this, I've heard people talking about. It'll be likely fixed, hopefully before it'll become an issue.
 5. Anonymity set
**Summary.** I don't think anyone would argue anonymity set is the most important bottle neck of privacy technologies in cryptocurrencies.  
The main problem is we have no idea what anonymity set is enough. Take for example physical cash which today provides an anonymity set that's almost unmeasurable, or chaumian e-cash: which is not implemented, but can provide cash like anonymity set. While in cryptocurrencies only z-cash has the potential to get close to huge anonymity sets, yet z-cash has some different issues. Practical ones, like nobody uses it and theoretical ones, that's out of the scope of this discussion. Where in Bitcoin: Bitcoin mixers provide no privacy at all, due to amount analysis, JoinMarket provides 2-6 anonymity set, where other CoinJoins can hit hundreds of anonymity sets, depending on the users. Monero is doing 6ish anonymity set. There is no way around it. Make a lot of mix, or whatever that's tiny. The biggest issue is the user patterns: due to age distributions links can be guessed with a high accuracy (80%):   
This further lowers the anonymity set to dangerously low levels.
**Short term.** It's a problem.
**Long term.** Who knows?
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:12:06
Isn't it all comes down to who routes the payments? Since the addresses are fixed, the information is known by those who are forwarding a bunch of payments. Since LN is expected to be high volume it's different than BTC, where you make 1-2 transaction a month, where in LN you make 1-100 a day. That's a lot more track to leave.

How? Cryptonote is a passive protocol. Does the proof gets removed from the blockchain in order to aggregate with newer proofs?


I admittedly didn't find any graph so I just threw in the first figure I found on stackexchange as a likely reasonable estimate. I didn't think it matters, since I just wanted to illustrate the bold claim about blockchain growth vs bandwidth and storage growth is completely incorrect.

Peter Todd's claim applies to c-lightning, not Lightning. c-lightning is an implementation, considered to be especially unreliable at the moment, so it should not come as a surprise.  
He has similar things to say about Eclair, which is just as unsurprising:  


I wonder what he'd say about `lnd`, which is considered to be unreliable, but the most reliable.

The biggest obstacle when an economist says something about Bitcoin is that it looks at its current state, like it would be static while Bitcoiners always argue with its potential state. This is why I tried to separate "short term" and "long term" discussion, but you just mixed them together, oh well, here we go:




Don't do this, please. You missed my point about stealth addresses. This is exactly what Blockchain analysis companies are data mining the whole internet for. From now on Blockchain analysis can connect your Reddit username to other places, where you leaked this address. ShapeShift/Crypsy/Mintpal/Poloniex/Bittrex, whatever you used your sensitive trading history may have been just leaked.


If I join together inputs with 100 participants, then my anonymity set is 100. If I make a Monero transactions then my anonymity set may be 6.  
There is the problem with amounts, what round based CoinJoins, like CoinShuffle, the clever JoinMarket hack or Confidential Transactions solve. 


Monero was created in 2014. In 2017-09 the monero blockchain is 21 GB. Today it's 39.4GB. I'd like to live in a world when hard disk size and bandwith doubles in every 5 months:)  


Please read back what I wrote on why Bulletproofs are not such a big deal on cryptonote, but is a big deal in coinjoin. I may be wrong and there is a way to overcome this, but you forgot provide any.
I haven't heard of Tim Ruffing's CT shceme, thanks for mentioning.  


That's an argument based on "appeal for authority." I need more than that. So here's the notion the whole paper is based on, please explain how it's been solved: **Among transaction inputs, the real input is usually the “newest” one.**

Take a look at [ZeroLink]( it approaches the problem from a different direction, but you will have a good idea what chain analysis can and cannot do.  


99% accurate.
1. Blockchain analysis: the tumbler is not perfect: it leaves traces on the blockchain. The Tumbler's transactions can be identified fairly accurately, so chain analysis can see the entrance and exit transactions. And amount correlation will tell who sent to who.
My expert instinc tells me this may result in a 80% accuracy.  
2. Network analysis. But there is another problem. Chain analysis companies run Electrum servers. Long story short, finding a conneciton between your Electrum 1 client and Electrum 2 client is "easy peasy lemon squeezy", without any blockchain analysis.
Not simply by Electrum's Stratum protocol`blockchain.address.get_balance`requests, but also the IP you are broadcasting your transaction with. If you are lucky you didn't bump into any BC analysis server, but you likely will in the future.  
So why don't we see mass arrests today? I guess it's something similar, like how police works. They are only interested in big fishes, everything else is just paper work. They just keep their information for themselves. At least for now.  
On the other hand if you succeed to not KYC yourself during your last step then your privacy is fine.
What can you do better?
1. Use Bitcoin Core. That completely defeats network analysis. Well, transactions broadcasting is still an issue, but that's not clear how real "supernodes" are who are trying to identify the source of the transactions. Depending on your paranoia use Tor with Core.  
2. Add JoinMarket round, too to try to defeat blockchain analysis to some degree. While JoinMarket provides low anonymity set, at least it reliably provides it, unlike bitcoin mixers.

I agree.


What do you mean by this?


You are completely safe. Amount analysis is only problem with current centralized mixers and Blockchain.info's SharedCoin. Round based mixing and Confidential Transactions are both perfect solutions against amount analysis. Confidential Transactions are just more economical.


That's not how TumbleBit/ZeroLink/JoinMarket/CoinShuffle/ValueShuffle works. In those systems you are mixing the same amount as everyone else.


I'd love to see an analysis on the privacy of LN. People are throwing the words "LN is anonymous" around way too often, based on that it solves some privacy problems. They just forget it also creates new ones.  


While privacy in the base layer is preferable, it has problems, too. Anonymity is teamwork, if some peers of yours looses their privacy in some way (for example through KYC or network analysis), then your anonymity set suffers, too. To sum up: while privacy in the base layer provides more privacy than on top layers, it also backfires, because this privacy is more unreliable. Of course it is worth reiterate that privacy in the base layer is more preferable, it's just not without problems.

That's not true. In JM you pay to every maker. In Wasabi only to the coordinator. Your fees in JM is maker fees * anonymity set. In Wasabi the anonymity set is 100. Thus if one maker fee in JM is 10x higher, then using Wasabi is precisely 10x cheaper.

TLDR: Smartphones are nasty, but they'll get better.  
In theory, Wasabi could support smart phones (Android, iOS). In practice, these platforms and their tools are not mature enough just yet. The concept of network analysis resistant smartphone wallets are not yet proven. If we would try to port Wasabi's code today, the wallet would use too much storage space, battery and network. Another implementation issue comes from Wasabi's reliance on Tor, which adds another layer of friction. On the desktop, we were able to work around nearly all of the reliability issues of the anonymity network, but the current state of Tor on mobile platforms may pose additional challenges.  
However, technology is improving quickly, thus, timing has special importance in this matter.

Frequent fliers fail to buy a ticket 30% of the times due to some card problems. Not sure if it applies to US domestic fliers though.  
There is always some shit going on. Just a few I encountered:  
1. Card is declined.  
2. The website is buggy, eg. it doesn't react when you click on the pay button.  
3. There is a limit on the card.  
4. It wants some securepay secondary pin or something.
5. Your card cannot be used in that country.
6. The payment gateway doesn't work.
And the list goes on and on... I've never met such a diverse set of problems with cards on other places, only when I try to pay for a plane ticket online.  
Not even talking about that 99% of these travel websites smell like scam, so your well refined scam detectors you learned in the Bitcoin world is useless, therefore you are always afraid of some malicious party gaining access to your card details.  
On the contrary with Bitcoin there is no charge back. Although from personal experience I suspect the charge backs with debit cards are pretty much an illusion of safety, too, they don't actually do charge back, not for me or anyone who tried I know of.

I guess the reasoning is, because privacy tech can be used to do illegal things (so do shoes) and so if we specify in the T&amp;C that our users cannot do those things, then if someone would attack us, then we can say our user agreed to that they are not going to do illegal things. As I said, I tried to make those legal documents one-liners, but "that would be highly unwise" so they said.

You trust Trezor to validate the blockchain for you and that Trezor is not spying on you. Which is reasonable, Trezor seems to me a company full of competent and decent people.
By trust, he means you trust Trezor to tell the correct state of the blockchain for you.  
By privacy he means you trust Trezor's backend to not spy on you.

I simply proved your number, since you pointed to an article, which pointed to another article, which pointed to the whitepaper, which took some time to figure out.  


I don't. I never even mentioned inputs, since they are irrelevant.


I also pointed out this statement while factually correct is highly misleading. While Monero benefits from Bulletproofs to some degree, CoinJoin benefits to a much greater degree.  


That's the point. Monero "has more transactions within the same anonymity set group", while CoinJoin is one transaction only. The end result is, if you want to increase Monero's anonymity set you have to have separate proof for every transaction, while you only need one proof for a big CoinJoin transaction.

You're right, I tend to dismiss this detail, because ultimately it leads to the same result. That being said, do you know anyone actually look at the code to say it's really sending the xpub and not just addresses? You cannot ask them any sensitive questions because you'll either get lies, attacks, or misdirection for answer. This is the worst when talking about their wallets, they're not straight about anything and anyone who's competent values his time more than to look at their spaghetti codebase.

I don't know too much about OTC markets, but it seems to me this MAXM is fucking with us.  
  
It was holding 10btc 400$ bid, it cancelled it.
Then yesterday after 9:42 it started to hold this 5000btc 350$ bid, then it cancelled it.  
Today after 9:33 it put back this 5000btc 350$ bid.  
  
Again, I don't know too much about these markets, but this looks to me, like MAXM is trying to hype itself.  
It checks, if asks starts to appear after 9:30, if not it puts its bid back, to be hyped.

I'd like to grab the opportunity to clear up the general misconceptions those come up every time this email is discussed.  
  
**TLDR:** This was the email what Satoshi used. The email was not spoofed and the authenticity of this email has never been debunked. Bear in mind: **not disproved ≠ proved.**  
**Sources:** You can find comprehensive references of my claims in the blog post: [Not all post 2011 Satoshi appearance has been debunked](  
**Personal opinion:** Regardless if this email came from Satoshi or not, the content is instructive and it aged well.  
**Context:** In the August of 2015 someone sent this email to the dev mailing list from satoshi as a response to Gavin Andresen's and Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT fork attempt. This attempt also was accompanied by a [vote manipulation attack on This resulted in a persecution of Core developers by this sub. Kinda like what you see today at
which did not exist at the time.  


Technical analysis showed:  


**FAQ 1: But Craig Wright used this email address, right?**  
No, he used satoshin to deceive us, not the real satoshi  
**FAQ 2: But this email had been hacked, right?**  
No, satoshin was hacked, more specifically re-registered after it expired.  
**FAQ 3: But he didn't sign it with his PGP.**

You cannot use Wasabi's CoinJoin under 0.1BTC. Above that everything goes. Of course thousands of BTC would stick out of the crowd and would take a long time, since you won't find other peers having that much, but 0.1-100 is fine.  
Not that, if you are not using CoinJoin and you are not using Bitcoin Core, your privacy gains with Wasabi is also substantial, due to our network level privacy protections, which other wallets doesn't do.

This is great. Congratulations! It's so simple (in theory, I didn't try) yet so useful.
I have a serious concern though, since I've been thinking about this quite a lot, too and I couldn't solve this problem: how do you handle wallet bloat?  
So if you go to the site you generate a new address. So what if I go to the site 1,000,000 times? (With software of course.)  
Then you'll keep generating new addresses each and every time? If so, wallet recovery will not be possible after an attack.
However if you have a fixed address pool and you serve visitors from that then I can just keep acquiring all your addresses.  
Same attack if you always show the first unused address until it gets used. (But I can see that's not what you are doing.)

There is no next minimum denomination. The system described in the issue above fixes that once and for all.  
The system above is a pure mathematical optimization problem, the question is: given a set of inputs, you want to minimize the costs and maximize the sum of anonymity sets that a mix produces.  
Now, I came up with some much more efficient algorithm already than what we use, but these are just intuitive heuristics. I want a mathematician to come up with the best solution before I'd implement it.

Your extpubkey is needed by them to monitor your wallet. My point was it's not trivial to solve this privacy leak in a light wallet, so it's not unnecessary information. They send your xpub to their servers, not because they want to, but because they have to, it's because they did not succeed or did not try to fix this issue.

I did not calculate that. Please read my blog post.


If you want to calculate the difference between a single JM and WW tx, that's easy. In fact let's calculate with 0% maker fees.  
In JM you pay for the whole tx, which is with Wasabi's anonymity set is 100 times a normal tx fee. In WW you pay 0.003 * 0.1BTC + 1 time tx fee.  
I let you figure out which is cheaper.


Since the GUI support of JM had been withdrawn JM does barely have takers thus makers raced their fees to the bottom. Thus JM is underpriced.
It is also interesting to note why JM GUI support had been discontinued: Because of the lack of development resources.

As I understand it, it only matters in the case if the Tumbler or Bob is malicious. In which case, let's say the time window is 1 day, so if the Tumbler or Bob is malicious Alice and the Tumbler gets back their escrowed coins.  
But normally the channel will be closed as soon as the all the interactions are over, and since you can set the timewindow for days or so, the interactions can take unrealistically long, without any problems.

Who knows if it is a good idea to encourage something like Bitcoin?  
  
What is much more important is to enable it. Don't fuck with people who want to develop, don't tax it, just clarify, it is perfectly fine to do anything with it.  
**1. Will you be enables or leave it in the gray?**  
  
There is only one thing you could do is to let people pay you with Bitcoin. You should remember by building out the infrastructure comes from people paying you money. Is this really worth it?  
In my opinion no, it is not the job of the government until you have demand for it. But maybe you in the estabilishment think differently.

We use the blockchain in order to resist Sybil attack. In a permissioned ledger there is no such an attack possible, because the nodes are not anonymous. Ergo there is no need for blockchain.  
And if you look up on those "private blockchains", like ripple, eris, Tim Swanson's works, etc, you will quickly realize there are no blockchains. They only use that word to get some attention. That being said, they have some usability, but they are not very revolutionary, bitcoin is in a way higher league.

IMO wallet implementations fucked up the seeds. It would be a much better way if you'd have to use your password AND the seed to access your master private key.  
  
I am not sure why it happened this way, when I started to wallet develop the NBitcoin C# implementation made it an obvious developer decision that you should only be able access your master private key with a password AND (the wallet file OR the seed).

Ergo it is not a terrible idea to not give blind trust to them, so searching for the word "destinia" is something what can and should everyone do who're planning to use that site. After that search everyone can decide.

[This]( page shows you how the blocks are coming in realtime. Try to figure out what this wants to show you and you will gain a better mental model.  
The miners are constantly fighting with each other who does the next block. The winner will.  
  
When you send a transaction from your wallet, you send that transaction to a full-node and that node will tell every other full-node that "hey, here is a transaction". Now the full-nodes have a lot of transactions like yours (unconfirmed ones) and the number of these are growing, until the miner wins the fight and includes many of them into a block. The higher the fee your transaction have, the more likely your transaction will get picked up by the miner.

As the linked roadmap says, August 1 beta on the mainnet, if the legal side of it is completely taken care of by then.  
We plan to roll out the stable release on the fifth of November.  


For now "announcements" are [my Medium blog]( or [my Twitter page]( From August one to November the fifth we are planning to do "marketing," since "anonymity likes company.  
The quotes are, because I prefer to create content, instead of doing direct marketing in the traditional sense of the word, so we are likely going to answer a bunch of stackoverflow questions, write blog posts, create content that not only advertises a product, but simply draws attention in the relevant context, that "in this field, this software solves this and this."  


One of the thing I'd like to figure out in the "marketing" period is to give people who have the intention to contribute to do so. It's a tricky question, because most of the time when someone contributes to an open source project, even if it's with the best intentions, he'll disappear rather sooner than later and the maintenance or the cleanup of the things created remains to the maintainer, which can be often quite unproductive.  
That being said using the wallet (and so providing liquidity to the mixes) from August one is a thing that anyone could do and would be a great help.  


Haha, yeah, every time I read ~~comments~~ essays I realize I know nothing, and it happens quite often.

@_date: 2018-04-21 22:18:05


One big problem lies along these lines. We know how to do privacy on Bitcoin since 2013, yet **everyone is researching fungibility and no one rolls out any product.** I am seeking to change it, more on this later, but I think this is no coincidence and let me elaborate on this.  
The closest we have to a privacy product is JoinMarket, yet it only provides plausibility, Monero-ish privacy with tiny anonymity sets, possibly even weaker than Monero, because there every transaction is a mix, in JoinMarket you are likely not interacting much with other JM users. To add to this, as network fees will grow, JM will become less and less feasible.  
The reason why nobody rolls out privacy products in Bitcoin is: it's freaking risky and it doesn't pay. Consequently we are left with a handful of half implemented, command line projects, as it's so typical in the open source world, the developer runs out of gas. You cannot really blame them though, **who would want to spend years of full time writing software without financial compensation and with a decent probability to get kidnapped by three letter agencies?** Privacy altcoin developers solve both of these issues: some people repeat all day long they work for free, too, but they don't. From personal experience, I worked in the core of an altcoin for a couple of months and even if it wasn't a new alt, the number of money making opportunities were many, you have such unique insight to the market you can play it basically risk-free. Also it is guaranteed there'll be a handful of other privacy altcoin devs, other than you and you have a feel of security of you're not going to be the first one to be taken by LE and you'll most likely get out just in time, before the shit hits the fan.  
So the question arises: how can we fix this? For long my answer was: well, someone must take one for the team, so I was coding HiddenWallet alone for years now, keeping an alpha version, people could use on the mainnet, yet when in December I was about to finally roll it out with ZeroLink on the mainnet, I have to admit, I didn't have the balls. I had multiple panick attacks. It was stressing me out emotionally: "I am going to roll out a software on Bitcoin, that doesn't have any privacy flaw anymore, it covers every possible way someone can lose its privacy." On the one hand I felt incredibly proud of myself, on the other I was afraid. "Should I move to Thailand or somewhere, burn my phone and be an illegal immigrant, live under the radar?" I was seriously considering this option. Then "fortunately" my public testing was not very successful, the software suffered from multiple stability issues, so I took the opportunity and pivoted back way more than I needed to: today I did not only rewrote the whole codebase of the software, but also the underlying Tor library, hell I even worked on to replace the HTTP and web sockets protocols with a home-grown one (ToT: Tor over TCP) just to gain some miniscule performance increase and stability and have better insight on how things work on deeper network level. That being said I spent a month on ToT, I never quite was able to get that right, so I dropped it eventually. To stay on point: I decided I have to keep it fully legal, because the "innovate faster than they can keep up with your work" only works, when you're writing some stupid fitness app to iOS, not on software that outright provides freedom for the people. So I decided to rename HiddenWallet to a more "family friendly" name: Wallet Wasabi, start a company by teaming up with two lawyers, (right away giving up 50% of the company to them!) so they make sure we are doing everything completely legal and we will be able to roll out [a freaking Bitcoin privacy product at last](

Actually the default in Bitcoin Core is 3 days, however you can change it and it's possible it'll sit in the mempool of others. In fact anyone can rebroadcast it (forever), since it's a perfectly valid signed transaction, so someone could intentionally mess with you.

Its development is ongoing.  
  
I am writing a dedicated wallet for that, called HiddenWallet because pretty much all wallets, except full nodes, like Bitcoin Core are fucked up from a privacy point of view and this degrades TumbleBit's effectiveness in practice.

@_date: 2017-05-10 14:28:49
Miners create blocks. Full nodes decide which blocks are valid.  
  
If miners create blocks with different block reward, than it should be, full nodes doesn't accept that block.  
However full nodes (users) can decide they want segwit blocks and don't accept old blocks anymore.  
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:27:55
About every 10 minutes there is a new block added to the blockchain. A block includes many transactions.  
The maximum block size is 1MB and today we are about to reach this limit.  
Every time it is the case the higher fee you add to your transaction the more likely it will confirm in the next block. Lower fee -&gt; later confirmations.  
  
The solution is easy, just elevate the blocksize limit. At least this how long some people can understand the topic.  
  
The reality is, it is a much more complex problem and elevating the blocksize limit would introduce many other issues, these issues would result fewer full nodes (full nodes are relaying the bitcoin transactions) and probably a two different Bitcoin, as we saw it with the Ethereum hard fork.  
  
But the situation is not bad at all, despite whatever some inpatient loud mouth say.  
Our main goal is to make more transactions possible and it can be done without increasing the blocksize. There are many developments and proposals currently being implemented those will all help us achieve more transactions, like segwit, lightning network, sidechains and many others. And probably there will be a blocksize increase, too.

You cannot. You signed the transaction and propagated it. Anyone is free to broadcast it until the end of times.  
That being said, if nobody willing to do that, it will drop out of the mempool and you'd be free to spend again.  
  
You have a couple of options to make sure it'll confirm sooner, tough:

Yes, if you are not talking about exotic transactions.  
Most of the transactions on the blockchain are normal transactions, (just to use the technical term).  
You can see the recommended fees/transaction size [here]( also query easily from your software, since these are dynamic.  
  
 On [tradeblock]( you can see the average transaction size is about 500 byte. You multiply the recommended fee with this number and you get your answer.  
If you need more confirmation you can just add 10-10 minutes for your estimated first confirmation time, that's the best you can do.  
For example in this very moment the recommended fees look like this:  
    {"fastestFee":40,"halfHourFee":40,"hourFee":10}  
So  
    40*500 = 20000satoshi = $0.0892760000  
It will confirm within 10min.

For easy end-user installation, a post-build event copies the python27 and joinmarket into the current working directory (Release/Debug).  
  
So the path will be "Python27/python.exe" and "JoinMarket/wallet-tool.py".  
  
It works well in command line too, I was just using the basic command in my explanation: "python.exe wallet-tool.py generate" but in reality it will be "Python27/python.exe JoinMarket/wallet-tool.py generate".

**The headline is a very important point,** what many of us fall for. When Roger keep repeating bullshit, like Core wants high fees! Core wants high fees! Core wants high fees! Then people in our side fell for it and starting to rationalize high fees. However we are the only ones who have a viable plan to avoid high fees. Gigabyte blocksizes couldn't even handle visa volumes, and that'd only be 0.1% of what Bitcoin should be able to handle at the point of worldwide adoption.  
On the other hand SW-&gt;LN does have a great chance to handle huge volumes without distrupting the network.  
  
But, yeah, sure keep rationalizing high fees and tell people how Bitcoin is settlement network, that sure won't confuse 99.99% of the people who are reading your post and know very little about Bitcoin and that what you are actually saying is "we can keep the unit of currency: btc, but the base layer might inevitably devolves into a settlement layer".

So how about sending in to viabtc those transactions first that need to confirm first.

Sure, but that was a trap, he was forced into the situation by authorities, he was entrapped. Look at what normal people are capable to do in survival movies when they have been forced into impossible situations, I bet much worse happens in real life in situations like that, since real life won't censor taboo.  
  
On the other hand Ross created a marketplace where you could do anything, except hurt others. Hunting and entrapping him was not only morally wrong, but also turned out to be a disaster and caused way more harm, than good, if you consider the level of criminality going on, on today's darknet marketplaces, unlike on the Silk Road.

Some people will argue for Gavin's cluelessnes with his Satoshi fail, but IMO he is just human so can be bamboozled with magic tricks.  
That is an other story he still did not admit he has been obviously tricked and why.  
But the truth is Gavin has not been contributing to the code for years. It is not because he was pushed out by politics, it is because core attracted smarter people and he couldn't do anything that would create value so he started to work on his long term vision of huge blocks where he thought he can still contribute, since nobody was working on it. He went down this road alone and his results were not good enough. And instead of figuring out a better way or abandon his work he started a war with his blog postings. He quickly got the support of Mike Hearn, who did contribut to the core only once (which resulted a hardfork interestingly, but I wouldn't blame him for it, nobody else noticed his bug), but had a big mouth and public support. He contributed a lot to upper layers of Bitcoins, like he created the bitcoinj java library. Anyway we all know what Gavin's blogging led.  
By the way the only person who was pushed out of core was Amir Taaki, because of his big mouth on advocating privacy. He was pushed out by Gavin.

It may seem counter intuitive, but it is. If I pay you some coins and it turns out I'm a drug dealer, then you'll have a bad time spending those coins elsewhere.  
If I pay my rent I don't want my landlord to know I can afford to pay more.  
I should not be able to know my coworkers get 5 times more than me, because I'd get super jelaous.
The examples are countless. This is what fungibility means and this is an essential property of good money. If we don't work on Bitcoin's fungibility then good money will drive out the bad money and Bitcoin will lose its market share.

The problem is not really the crashes, it's a problem if the tumbler malicios and wants to steal your bitcoins.  
There are various scenarios when the clients not being online can result in coin loss in case of malicious tumbler in the final TumbleBit protocol. Hopefully I'll be aware of all of them after I recode the higher level of TumbleBit protocol for HiddenWallet. In the described model I only see an unlikely one:  
  
Consider at the end of the article if the Tumbler signs Claim1 transaction, with that releases the X.  
Then Bob should be able to spend Claim2 with X, but let's suppose Bob is not online for 2 days and the refund can happen to the Tumbler after 1 day, then the Tumbler would get away taking the money.

Bitcoin gives you a choice to be your own bank. This way of using it requires a more privacy aware approach, than using traditional institutes, because they provide you privacy against your neighbors and your stalker ex-husband.

Yes, it is exactly what I meant by "today". There are multiple meanings of this word. When someone says "the young people today are so reckless" it does not really mean today, as opposed to yesterday, because they were not reckless yesterday.  


Yes, it does. But unlike direct blocksize increase, it does not requires a contentious hard fork and have many other benefits.

Not stupid question at all.  
There are multiple reasons:  
0) Waaaay more simpler to do it this way.  
1) They want to be transparent.  
2) A solution: they could pregenerate addresses and randomly showing them on their website.  
3) An other solution: They could use a Stealth address, but only those wallets could send money to it what they have built in this functionality.  
The main thing to realize, when you are dealing with only one address, you don't need HD wallet, you don't need to monitor the blockchain every kind of crazy way and you don't need to build transactions using multiple inputs.  
So as I said, it's just too much hassle.

Although other answers are correct, to see the big picture it's important to note even if the attacker gets your recovery words he will still not be able to access your wallet. You cannot just recover with the words. You still need your password for that.

That'd make the headerchain big (spv wallets care). That'd also bring confusion. "Now how many confirmation is needed?" And of course multipies the blocksize (or should we lower it accordingly?). Plus we need to lower the block reward and probably a bunch of other things I am missing.   
These changes have to be implemented into the 200 different Bitcoin libraries accordingly. Oh don't forget validators and safety checks and stuff. It's a hard fork, everyone would have to update the same time.

In Bitcoin if you don't put your payments completely offchain, eg. transact inside CoinBase then we will have a privacy problem, what we don't have today.  
  
In the banking system the banks and other trusted actors are who knows all about you. That is a good or bad way to do things, depends on who you ask.  
  
In contrast in Bitcoin the smart actors know all about you, not the powerful actors. Those who can read the blockchain and can conduct network analysis, so blockchain analysis companies.  
However we all know "information wants to be free". Opensource will catch up with the private sector eventually and then networ and blockchain analysis will become available to everyone. This of course assuming that we don't improve Bitcoin's privacy.

When someone, like Barry says it is perfectly transparent he is simply lying to decieve regulators and investors. When a Bitcoin expert says Bitcoin isn't anonymous he is technically correct but in practice it can function as an anonymous currency effectively. I don't like to use the word pseudonymous for mainstream audience. It just makes them more confused.  
  
Also there are planty of people working on progressing towards perfect anonymity on Bitcoin (me too). And we will reach that point when using Bitcoin anonymously will be just as convinient as the pseudonymous usage.

People who want to sell bitcoins are afraid they will get scammed with fake cash. And also for the full-time sellers it is not very efficient to make transfers in persion. Too much communication overhead, meeting, confirmation times and such.  
Funny story: I once had to wait 40 minutes for 1 confirmation. (I mean the miners fucked up and didn't want to mine a block for 40min, after the buyer wanted to see 2 more confirmations, because it thought I was doing something stinky.)

The post was edited since, at the time of my reply there was no source.  
After just barely reading into the article yes, I say exactly that. 


This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. While it's true you can get the private key from a public key with a theoretical attack that might happen in the next 100 years. But his conclusion is utterly wrong, as "you'll get all the bitcoins available", since bitcoin addresses are actually some magic on top of the public key's hash! Note: not on the public key. And that hash is quantum computer resistant.  
Ever wondered why we cannot just figure out all the addresses that has the same seed just from an address? Because we can get all (well, all child one, if hardened) from the public key. It is because it's a public key hash what we know and not public keys.

It means "simplified payment verification". In a nutshell you can only be sure if a payment happened, if you run a full node, because it builds the full blockchain, validates the blocks from the beginning of times, so it cannot be tricked into a transaction happened when it didn't.  
If you use blockchain.info, blockchain.info runs that full node for you and you trust blockchain.info won't trick you.  
But what if you want to ask transaction information from random people? It turnes out if you build only the headerchain from the beginning of the times, then you can be sure if a payment happened (not as sure as in a full node), through some merkle proof magic, which I won't go into, mostly because I cannot bring out this information from the top of my head. Now that's SPV.

This is a great video, finally someone talks about UASF from the viewpoint of users and businesses.  
  
**If you are a user:**  
1. Take your money out of centralized services until August 1 and hold your own private keys.  
2. From here on you either use Bitcoin with a service that supports both UASF and legacy chain, so you know what is happening or don't use them at all until one of the chain dies.  
  
**If you are a business:**  
You must support both UASF and legacy chain. Not only for to protect your customers, but also for to avoid legal troubles later.  
You need to have 3 balances:  
- UASF only balance  
- legacy balance  
- common balance

The book is not published. Donations are possible. Not really campaigning on that though.  
And it will not be considered to be finished as long as there are developments in the Bitcoin space.

My view is, every other country's soliders should get the fuck out of the middle east. Borders should be open, governments should not keep them out from our taxes (yeah, I'm from Hungary), but neither should they help them in anything from our taxes.  
If people decide to help them, then go for it. That's why I think this is the right approach. But if people are not willing to help them anymore, then they won't come, because they know governments won't help them either and they cannot demand help from any central authority, since people are helping them in a decentralized fashion, and as we all know, it's pretty hard to pressure decentralized systems. That's how it should be.

I hope not just the numbers, but the quality will improve too.

It always fascinates me when I hear people arguing that the central bank cannot create money out of thin air. I am pretty sure here will be someone saying that too.  
But it can create debt out of thin air and as you showed in your model that debt is mathematically impossible to pay back and well that debt has to be covered by newly created money (see 2008), what the FED will create.  
Well that debt suddenly became money. So the FED does create money out of thin air after all.

I might misunderstand you, but you don't need equal amount of inputs, and having all outputs equal wouldn't help much. In fact, because of Bitcoin utxo model both goals are close to impossible to achieve.  
   
Consider you want to spend 1btc from a 2.1btc input and your buddy want to spend 1btc from 0.4btc and 0.7btc inputs.  
If you join together your coins the outputs would be: 1btc, 1btc, 1.1btc and 0.1btc.  
The only thing you might be able to can deduct from this is which input pair got the change back, but the more inputs are joined the less likely you can find those connections (See [CoinJoin Sudoku](

Barry's history is not that clean either, remember his ETC pump? Keep saying to regulators that "Bitcoin is completely transparent", "GBTC in two weeks". These actions might some people would consider morally acceptable, but just as many would question them. My point is, he wouldn't have moral concerns for a moment to trying to execute my theory. But even if he believes a blocksize HF is possible, the outcome will be the same, because it's not. Let's be real here, if anything we learned from the last couple of years, pushing through a blocksize HF today on Bitcoin has zero chance. Luckily his first step is pushing through sw sf.

@_date: 2015-11-08 20:19:19
I think the third is the less serious concern. The "problem" of the current debate is rather that, the development is too decentralized.  
It's so decentralized they couldn't even come to consensus in a question like this blocksize, what is so minor, compared to something like changing the 21mil cap.  
  
What I would acknowledge is the miner centralization. Mining is very decentralized right now, what is fine. But we can see the trends, where this is all going in the (very) long term. What is worrisome.  
However we have millions of developers working and hopefully this trend will be turn around..

I think Core would rather keep it flexible.  
But also from a privacy point of view, other than broadcasting transactions you don't need Tor for Core.  
In that case the only information you leak is that you are using Bitcoin, which is pretty much acceptable, especially when you look at the alternative, where the leaking information is that you have a huge amount of data flowing through Tor.  
  
That being said I've recently seen a BIP (which I cannot find atm) about private transaction broadcasting. IMO if that ever gets implemented (and working) there'll be absolutely no reason to use Tor with Core anymore.

"2014 also saw a 57% increase in the volume of bitcoin trading but a 149% increase in the number of active bitcoin wallets, revealing that the number of bitcoin users is increasing faster than the amount being traded."  
I don't think this is the right conclusion. An individual person can and does maintain more and more wallet over time.  
For example in my case, when I realized I shouldn't rely on coinbase entirely, I've moved to blockchain.info, but still maintaining my cb wallet, to diversify. Then I've realized it would be a more secure/private solution to have a blockchain.info wallet over tor so I'm also maintaining a wallet there. Also I'm constantly moving money to my paper wallets, too.  
So now I have a cb wallet to diversify.  
I have a blockchain.info wallet to buy beer.  
I have an other blockchain.info wallet over tor to make anon payments over the internet.  
And I have some paper wallets.  
Didn't you guys went through on a similar evolution?

The first node who you broadcast to learns your ip address.  
If you are broadcasting a transaction today, it is not that easy to figure out where the transaction actually came from, you can never be sure if the node that first sent you the transaction is actually the source of the transaction. However there are "supernodes" connected to a bunch of nodes, those can guess, not sure how well.  
By using Tor you cover yourself. Well, ideally you want to change the Tor circuit (your IP address) between every transaction broadcast, too.

But if you report in that way I described you can follow the process, for example in my case all the onecoin reports are: "IN REVIEW" state. Also you get notified when they accept or decline your report.

That's just not how it works...  
  
Let's say the buyer was a complete idiot and did not obtain the coins anonymously through localbitcoin or through an anonym bitcoin atm.  
And he also did not obfuscated his coins with any kind of mixing service.  
So he bought coins on coinbase, sent them to silkroad and bought a weapon. From the time he sent the money to the market that money won't be associated to the specific sale, neither to his username without hacking the market, where the operators must be complete idiots, too so they happens to be logging everything.

Yes, not the required payment amount. You send 1btc and you can spend let's say 0.1 bitcoins to anyone, but not sure how low the denomination can go without seeing it in works.  
  


  
There are so many directions to take. The first item on the roadmap is full block spv wallet, which we both finished already. The next is tumblebit classic tumbler mode. I will implement only the client, they want the server, too.  
I personally don't think they actually will implement the server, they will realize it's not a good way to go and it's bad for privacy somewhere down the line. However if not the two project start diverge from here, not only the codebase, but the principles, too.  
After TumbleBit Classic Tumbler mode is integrated I want to make it easy to use and implement transaction filtering, which will result huge performance increase. In fact I will probably do this with the Samourai wallet guys: properly creating BIPs and stuff. The two projects will completely diverge form here.  
  


  
I am following the roadmap, I put on GitHub, all items has links, I think that's a great way to catch up with some substantial knowledge on the projects:

Yes, that's right. My point was, the amount the attacker has to possess to Sybil is so unreasonably large that we don't even have to go into discussing the costs in the first place. But again, it's not 800. That's just the naive estimate if we'd calculate with the volume and not the backlog also I calculated it generously with 20 honest - 80 sybil ratio which is questionable what it'd achieve.

You're right, that is definitely not true, I can't believe I said that:) My point was handling multiple arrdesses is hassle (but it definitely worth it).  
But usually not when you gather donations, since you probably want more transparency, like how much donations you gather should bee seen by anyone. It might be a better idea to break the chain somehow after the one big donation address.  
Stealth addresses doesn't break the chain, what it basically does it enables people to give the same stealth address to everyone. And with some magic under the hood the sender will generate a bitcoin address for the receiver. Then with some other magic under the hood the receiver will acquire the private key of the address.  
The point is if the receiver is using change addresses stealth addresses doesn't useful anymore. And with stealth addresses anyone can see that was a stealth transaction. With change addresses that just look normal.  
It would be only cool if Stealth addresses would be widespread, so stealth transactions wouldn't be "suspicious".

Nothing. Let's not forget we are talking about TumbleBit's Classic Tumbler mode (there are more, this is the easiest), what is implemented today.  
  
TumbleBit while can provide extremely huge anonymity set, it's slower. In JoinMarket you'll mix your coins together with 3-6 people, because of various fee and coordination issues. In TumbleBit depending on the liquidity it's 300-600 people.

800BTC is not enough to get things even started.
It seems like my post was too long to grasp in one go. What you are missing is that the naive calculation says the adversary have to use up 800BTC every 2h to keep up the Sybil attack. This by itself encounters many practical issues, but also there's the backlog. This 800BTC only reflects the current volume. Our volume is this "low" because we are not able to serve all the people. For example if someone comes with 100BTC then it'll take months to mix.  
From this 100BTC only 0.2BTC is reflected in the 800BTC calculation (0.1 for the base denomination and add 0.1BTC for the anonsets.)
You can also think about it like this: **In order to Systemic Sybil Attack you have to have exactly 99 times more BTC than the sum of everyone who wants to mix at any given time.**

I don't think account is compromised. He's been quick to laud his strong confrontational opinions, which often I think are uncalled for, but I've also seen him living up to his mistakes more often than others do it in the space.  
Take a look at this example when I went into great extents to figure out what's in his mind:
Cobra published an article with a very unpopular opinion: [I think Halong Mining is a scam](  
I've proof-read it and came to the conclusion that it's more likely that he's right than that he's not. Although his article was compelling, he only had circumstantial evidence, so as a result of my investigation I've still had some doubts. Thus I published an article [Is Halong Mining a Scam?](  
After that I did some further investigation and found that it's not a scam after all, so I added it to my article and changed the title: [At Last: Halong Mining is NOT a Scam](  
And later on Cobra came forward and [lived up to his mistake,]( too: 


I think Cobra is really pushing people's buttons because he is very quick to come to strong conclusions and even take actions, even when they are unpopular and he's the owner of Bitcoin.org, which makes some scared of him possessing too much power and afraid that he'll abuse it. At one point I was afraid of this, too, but now I'm not worried anymore, because I realized that Cobra can be reasoned with, unlike that other site's owner. Like [this one time]( when he changed Bitcoin.org's to default to Knots instead of Core, he didn't have the last say on the topic, even though he had the power, rather he accepted the community's decision.

I did something similar. A tip: you might want to consider writing CodeProject articles if you want to gain greater technical interest without actual marketing.  
Not sure how popular CodeProject is in Python but I was able to introduce Bitcoin to more than 10,000 developers by writing [Bitcoin tutorials in C

I see, so if you block them then they ask for experience. But I am not sure it matters.  
However when you report the way I described, it will go to review que and after they have reviewed they ask for the same "how was your experience" with the description box.  
I know it would be more ideal to report as a scam, but it is probably not effective.

Really? Your conclusion is: Adam Back wants $100 fees?  
It is speculation on the maximum fees that people would pay in case Bitcoin cannot scale.  
  
If I ask you how high the fees can go that 7 people per second can still tolerate and you give me a huge number I would not call you out "for you wanting high fees".

The original idea and roadmap for Breeze was [this]( and it still pretty much holds true. So make no mistake Breeze will add huge value to Bitcoin.  
That being said I left the team and started working on [HiddenWallet]( because [I had some concerns with their marketing](  
  
However they have really good developers and Breeze will definitely add great value to Bitcoin, but not in the way as some people expect. For example talked about instant transactions. This expectation is factually true, but there are huge buts:  
- But in TumbleBit's Classic Tumbler mode, which is currently implemented a transaction will take like half a day and the user is forced to use fixed denomination.  
- In TumbleBit's Payment Hub mode you need to open a payment channel first and send money to anyone instantly who also opened a payment channel with the Tumbler. But to preserve anonymity you need to use fixed denominations here, too. Also it's unidirectional payment hub, so you must settle your balance on the Bitcoin network from time to time in order to be able to spend it.  
  
So yes, you can do anonymous instant transactions, but there are buts...  
  
And yes, there are also some discussion on how to solve the buts, but those are like 10 year down the road and the ideas are not exactly perfect.

Dropping here my thoughts on Sybil attacks from emails I sent to a few days ago. It's basically the expansion on what said on the other reply to this post. I'm curious about your thoughts on the topic, too. 






A round kicks in in every 2 hours or when 100 participants come together.
A Systemic Sybil attacker would want to provide most of the Sybils for most of the participants, so let's say it provides 80 participants for all the 50 honest would be peers.
The denomination is 0.1BTC, so the attacker would need 80 * 50 * 0.1BTC (=400BTC) to attack one round based on the most attacker favorable calculation I could possibly come up with.
One obvious flaw is that we don't actually mix 0.1BTC per participant per round, but we mix on the would be changes, too, so there are further denominations introduced: 0.2BTC, 0.4BTC, 0.8BTC and so on. This roughly doubles the above 5BTC per 2h mixing volume to 10 BTC / 2h, thus the final attack requirement would not be 400BTC, but 800BTC every 2 hours.
Now, also notice that the 10 BTC per 2h volume is not what one should calculate this attack, but one should calculate with the backlog. There's a huge backlog of coins waiting to be registered for mixing, it's just we're not able to properly serve and mix them with our current architecture. How large this backlog is? Nobody knows, probably orders of magnitude larger than the 10BTC volume. So the Systemic Sybil attacker would have to provide about 80 times backlog amount of bitcoins to attack. This is infeasible.
There are also further difficulties the attacker faces, which is unnecessary to discuss if you don't find a fatal flaw in the above calculations: IsStandard comformity (especially the mempool-chain-too-long) issues. Does the attacker wants to do it in a covert way? How much transaction fees must be paid?

The calims are:  
  


  
1) Kleiman got cryptography, just like Satoshi.  
  


In the early 2000s, Kleiman began contributing to computer security mailing lists such as those maintained by securityfocus.com and metzdowd.com, the latter of which was also used by Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of Bitcoin.
2) Kleiman used metzdowd.com, just like Satoshi.


3) Kleiman was involved in Bitcoin early, just like Satoshi.  
  
Let me gather these 3 claims:  
1) Kleiman got cryptography, just like Satoshi.  
2) Kleiman used metzdowd.com, just like Satoshi.  
3) Kleiman was involved in Bitcoin early, just like Satoshi.  
  
Anyone who used that cryptography mailing list, likely got cryptography, so the (1) claim is redundant.  
Now let's examine the two remaining claims:  
So anyone who used metzdown.com and was early involved in Bitcoin in 2009-2010 is suspected to be Satoshi by a chance of 1 to as many people that two claims apply, which might be maybe 100?  
So there's 1% chance that Kleiman was Satoshi.  
So you might think, but there's a trap. Using metzdowd while suggestive, it's not a criteria of being Satoshi. There might be many people who didn't use that mailing list and still could be Satoshi, so now the chances are &lt;1%?  
  
And all this assuming the (3) claim is true.  
Fishy: 
 
- Klieman died in 2010. Wright entrusting Kleiman with coins in 2011. - ???  
- "unfinished draft of a trust contract showing Wright entrusting Kleiman with 1.1 million bitcoins in 2011."  - What? Entrusting? Contract? The inventors of Bitcoin not even using Bitcoin for not ideological, but practical purchases? A cryptographer would be more reassured by a lawyer coctract than a bitcoin transaction? Are you familiar with the phrase: "txid or gtfo"?  
- "The documents provided to Gizmodo include what appears to be an unfinished draft" - Provided by who? Where is the photo? Come on, based on Wright's long and sophisticated con man history it is safe to say he provided those fake, secret documents, or just some cash to the writers. Oh wait, maybe he bribed them with a trust contract?:)

That's part of the joke. For the last couple of years I am actively trying to figure out if Brian Hoffman is a genius or retarded. Or both.  
Hard to figure out when he's serious and when he's just trolling. But I guess it's outside the context of this video.

I see, it might wasn't clear from what I said, but the business was already built. I will try to dig it up when I have time. A little old school Bruce Wagner will be good for nostalgy:)  
Edit: already found it

If you don't run a full node all your wallet addresses are already linked together by various third parties.

Most BIPs have nothing to do with Core.

Good point, it didn't cross my mind. I wonder if that's the case though.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:37:41
It won't drop because of asicboost. Asicboost lowers the energy cost, it doesn't increase the hash rate.  
  
**Edit**: pointed out this is not the whole story.

What's that?


  
I refered to this. As I understand you the full transaction would only come if the client decided based on the "superinv" messages if the transaction is needed or not, and if it is then asks for the transaction.  
In this case you directly tell the node what transaction you are interested in.

In that case Visa knows how many bitcoins you have, but not just that it knows where they come from and where they go.  
  
Fungibility is one of the few essential properties of good money. And the lack of it is the reason why the traditional financial system is innefficient compared to Bitcoin.

The exchanges category is new. But yes, it seems like that'll be the proper resolution.

Just done a quick calc by hand. I would guess it will confirm in about an hour.  
It is a bit under the current 21 recommended hourfee.

I hope you get a straight answer to this.

I liked the old Bitcoin scammers better. The new ones seems more credible from outside.

I think the there was a little bit of confusion introduced in this article, so I'd like to grab the chance to clarify a few things.  
If Bitcoin gets Confidential Transactions with Bulletproofs (which is a HUGE assumption) and we combine it with a high liquidity and high anonymity set CoinJoin (100 peers in every 2-5 minutes) then anonymous transactions could cost the almost exactly the same as normal transactions.  
Now if you add Schnorr signatures to this, you'll end up having anonymous transactions those are less than 20-30% cheaper than normal bitcoin transactions.  
But, before you'd pop champagne I also have some drawbacks and implementation concerns on top of my head:
- Schnorr is an interactive protocol, thus rounds may take a bit longer, maybe 5-10 minutes?
- Long rounds lead to worse DoS protection, so you wouldn't have a guarantee.
- This may only work for about 20 years until QC comes.
- You'd still need to use another anonymity network to hide your IP, which is another layer of friction, which leads to unreliable connection, which leads to more failed rounds.
- We may not be able to build it in a fully decentralized way, the closest we have is ValueShuffle, which still requires a central server for example to broadcast transactions. Since we assume every transaction is mixing transaction in a dedicated wallet, Dandelion would  be not needed unless transaction broadcasting decentralization issue would be solved.
- There's still a network analysis issue, but I guess Neutrino could cover that. It'd still be hard to make it to be comfortable for mobile.
- And lastly, I'd like to remind you that my I started out with a bold assumption that CT/BP gets into Bitcoin.

Good guy government brings justice to Bitcoinland.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:13:41
Right, I was just intentionally missing the point, like you.

How much money do you have?

There is no other category.

SegWit2x results roughly in 5mb blocksize.

It is still [terrible from a privacy point of view]( but that thing is really hard to fix. However it might be great for other purposes, like light lightning client, so I'm looking forward for further progress.  
  
Anyway, just one thing to note: don't market it as a "more private bip37", because in the big scheme of things it provides close zero privacy, just like bip37, especially if you add your handling of unconfirmed txs idea. We already walked a long road to debunk the privacy of bip37, because of the "marketing confusion" created around it.

- Time
- Cost
- Incoming and Outgoing amounts on the Bitcoin Blockchain
- How do you exchange it without confidentiality?
- One or two Monero txs arguably provide weak privacy.

Big difference but if you only care about the fees it doesnt matter
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:45:20
I think the availbability of resources is very important. Consider when you want to do some magic with a string, you google it, you have the answer within 1 minute. But what if you want to know something about the x-y protocol?You will have to spend hours, looking at the rfc to figure out what the hack you should do with it.  
  
Bitcoin is in the latter category. It's new and you will need to figure out basic stuff yourself, by browsing the source codes of other people and looking at whitepapers and specifications. You will not be able to just google the answer that often.

In Wasabi we pay everyone and for all our costs (server hosting, travel, accommodation, etc...) with Bitcoin. It's not really a philosophical decision, it's just way simpler like this.
