 Take a picture and collect Bitcoin donations.

I'm sure you are convinced by this argument -  I'm not going to argue with that.  But try to tell this to your brother-in-law who has $3M in stocks and bonds and wants to know what stops the value of bitcoin from dropping 25% in two months for no apparent reason.

These bullish estimates assume that most of the crypto-economy will be in bitcoin itself.   I think it is fairly safe to project that without 8-10 years the crypto-economy will be worth Trillions.  However, people may at some point move their bitcoin assets into crypto-assets which actually have underlying value.  This is part of the goal of 2.0, as I see it. 
I'm predicting that once it becomes seamless to transact in XCP-type assets, people will prefer this.  ( Assuming regulators allow this, of course.)  People will always be queezy about the value of bitcoin.  Once someone mints a coin which defines legal ownership in a stash of gold somewhere- or in an ETF, there's a good chance everyone will jump in and there will be less of a market for bitcoin.

Yes, but if I could send you small fraction of all the equities on the S&amp;P, and you could send it back - it would be much more appealing to my rich brother-in-law.  If I explained it "it's like Apple Pay, but with Apple stock" I think he would go for this.   In the meantime he's going to be fine with credit cards.   
And no, the cryptocurrency interface is not an unecessary complication because it costs me $10 a transaction to buy an ETF at TDAmeritrade.  If I want to buy and hold an ETF, I would do this at TDAmeritrade.  But if I want to split a bill, or pay the hotdog vendor, or pay 3 cents for access to an article- then I would be happy just to have a bunch of crypto-SPY  hanging around in my crytpowallet, knowing that if I don't spend it, it's appreciating more often than not.  
Who cares at this point how it came about - it hasn't survived any major financial crisis yet, and most people do not share the enthusiasm.

Anytime treasury notes are earning negative interest rates you're gonna have an arbitrage problem.  That's why people were shitting their pants.

Do you have a copy of a legal order?   The Streisand effect loves these sort of documents.   To popehat and beyond!
