@_date: 2017-12-30 13:13:12
If bitcoin continues to gain value over time by 2040 fees will be MORE than enough to cover mining costs which will go DOWN due to efficiency in cheaper ASIC hardware using LESS electricity to power MORE hashing and MORE people will be mining. In fact I predict there will be a HUGE number of LN which will be cheap to open and close.

Sorry I'm not at a point where I can get technical but coinbase is a service which will sell Btc for dollars and will store those Btc for you in a wallet on their servers that they either control or partially control until you decide to move those Btc to another wallet or spend them. I don't believe they mix any coins because that could be construed as money laundering by "the government". Otoh, dark wallet would be a wallet you download and control fully. 
Coinbase needs your info to comply with aml and kyc laws as a msb.

Fuck vendors, the majority of which dump Btc for fiat and put down pressure on the value anyway. As if it costs so much to accept Btc. It may make more sense for some to hoard while for others it may make more sense to spend. When the time comes people will spend there Btc as they see fit. It's ridiculous to try to artificially induce people to do what's against their own best interest. Who are you, Bush after 911?

This is why anarchy is not utopian idealism. The market fails. Things go wrong. But individuals interact voluntarily instead of a central authority using the point of a gun to solve problems.

Basic econ supply vs demand. As long as demand is higher than supply price will go up. 
If everyone is running an ASIC then it takes an individual or small group everyone plus 1 to 51% attack the network. So millions of people running a cheap efficient ASIC running on solar power (this is 2040 btw) so you'd have to invest in a million and 1 ASIC hashing power just to fuck up your own investment. 
Fees are calculated by satoshis per kb. So if a Satoshi =$1 you're set, especially with cheap and efficient Asics. I don't know if you and other FUD spreaders are malicious or just lack vision but I prefer to see things in a positive light. We're in the fucking 21st century, act accordingly

Well if I were over several thousand years old I would. Unfortunately the singularity hasn't arrived yet. Government of one form or another has existed for too long, so they have been removing the choice of individuals to do these things voluntarily and then rewriting history books to brainwash you in school that momma government can only provide these services by stealing from you first, er... I mean taxes. 
But let's take your canard for a ride here. Do governments make movies? No, privately made. Yet they cost millions to make and employ hundreds. This is because there is a demand and money can be made. No guns had to be pointed at anyone. Expand that to things people need, like roads, bridges, education. Use your brain, I know there is one somewhere in that skull after all those years of government indoctrination... 
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:18:52
Bitcoin doesn't need THEIR regulation. It is 100% voluntary. If you think it's a scam don't use it. Stick to fiat. That has already been regulated and deregulated by these CROOKS for centuries. But most importantly bitcoin will be regulated by the community and not by these ASSHOLES. The revolution will not be centralized!

Really? You guys must be serious pacifists! Awesome! So if I got a majority of people to agree that I had the right to come to your house and demand money from you while swinging a batton threateningly in your general direction and threatening to kidnap you and hold you hostage that would give me the right to steal from you also?


And what about those who want to visit the moon and live on mars? Should we all be forced to pay for rockets so a privileged connected few can do whatever they want at my expense? Now I know these examples may be extreme, but sometimes it's good to look at extremes in order to get a point across.


All of these things can be done voluntarily. Mind you, I don't know how. But that's the beauty of different people thinking differently and finding solutions to problems. Just because you're used to some big amorphous organization doing it doesn't mean you need men with the power to kidnap you and hold you hostage to do it. You want these things, right? I'm sure a majority of people who live around you want them to, right? So why can't we find a way to pay for these things without the threat of violence?

I agree with most points. I disagree with having a problem with miners earning. They invest in specialized hardware taking a risk and should therefore be rewarded for the work that maintains the bitcoin network. I think you should demonize the market less and emphasize that proof of consensus may be a leaner and more effective way of achieving consensus. Secondly, do you foresee credits overtaking bitcoin? If so, will you be cashing out as soon as your pre sale is over to fund expenses of building the credits protocol? If not, it seems like a contradiction in your argument against alts.

Taxation = extortion, plain and simple, so don't pee on my leg and tell me it's for the good of society, that's bullshit. 
You are correct when you say not everyone sees the path to liberty and freedom and prosperity the same way. That is because the majority of people are brainwashed blind sheep who follow the shepherd even if it's plain as day he's a wolf in disguise.
Until people stop accepting extortion as a fact of life we are doomed to repeat all the mistakes of the past. Everything else is secondary to this plain and simple fact.

Not true. If anything it shows a private police force competing only with a state police Force can be equally as bad. What we need is a market of competing police forces to weed out the bad. If I don't like Pinkerton I don't have to hire them.

Do they use weapons to get those people from their house to the jail? 
Well let's use a little imagination. You could charge a toll for the roads. You could sell billboards and use the revenue to pay for their upkeep. There are many options other than threats of force and violence. You just have to be creative. 
So I guess there's no such thing as paying for a service you may or may not need? Oh wait a minute, insurance! Right, you could pay ahead of time just in case your house ever caught on fire. What if you neglected to pay? Well they could bill you later, setup a plan to pay your debt, or even look to charity. I know the local fire departments here do phone calls to raise funds twice a year. Not to mention volunteer firemen. 
So what government service is so vital we must use force threats and violence to achieve?

Stealth addresses allow you to post a public address online but no one can see how much is in said wallet. 
Coin mixing is already possible, it's just not integrated into any wallet software yet, you have to send the coins you want mixed into a mixing service with others who do the same, and also trust the mixer. Dark wallet wants to decentralize the service and mix your coins automatically from within the wallet.

Extortion to fund Healthcare, education is still extortion. And government and Banks are in the same bed. They are all tied in together. Don't be a fool.

First, Sorry for taking so long to reply. Had a busy weekend!


We may run around the streets with guns but we don't wave them at each other!


Not until there is a good enough reason. You know, like an ebola crisis, or terrorists, or those dirty jew bankers (Hitler's reason). As long as you decide there is this fiction called government that has powers beyond what regular people have, you will always have that risk. Remember, Hitler was an elected official who used the laws of that democracy to elevate himself to dictator status due to crises. Are you saying Germany wasn't a civilized nation before WWII?


I advocate the "don't steal from me or others" policy. If you can get together with others and build roads to remote areas, good for you. But don't threaten me with violence, kidnapping and a cage because I don't want to pay for your roads, or whatever else.


It is a dream world, because most people would prefer to use force and violence to get these things done instead of working with their fellow human beings to get them done in a peaceful manner. As long as they can leave the violence to "the government" instead of using the force directly themselves and bury their heads in the sand instead of realizing and accepting the fact that they are enslaving each other through this fiction called government.

If a ddos attack is what it takes to get to a decentralized solution then both Ghash's success and the attack against them will have contributed to the long term success of bitcoin. The foundation doesn't run bitcoin. The very notion that they quote them to justify their actions flies in the face of what bitcoin stands for. All participants in the market will continue to act in their own self interest until an equilibrium is reached. This includes attempts at market domination as well as corrective measures, be it the dropping of the price from panic selling or even bitching on reddit(guilty as charged). It all has varying degrees of effects on the system. A constant push and pull until we reach a point where everyone is satisfied.

Well yes and no. The banks could, and used to, issue their own notes. These would be backed by gold silver etc. In today's parlance, they could issue their own alt coin backed by btc deposited to them which they could loan out. Therefore their alt coin would be created out of thin air, but they would be responsible if they failed and no bailout or crashing of the economy because btc would be stable and strong regardless. Therefore you could decide whether to bank with a fractional reserve Bank or not and assume responsibility or miss out on profit accordingly.

What I don't understand is how exactly is financial services any different than any other market? Except that most people just don't understand it and don't want to? In the end it's all barter.

That's silly. Looks to me people are working diligently right now on the tech side on dumbing things down for the masses because they have economic incentive to do so, not because of regulation. All regulation does is ensure those with money and connections get to do business while eliminating their would be competition.

The main point of dark wallet is to make coin mixing a matter of course, and to decentralize it so you don't have to trust anyone to mix them for you, from my understanding. This will help get around government meddling and the currency flight that began in China and drove Btc to gold prices will resume and spread to Russia, Euroland, Argentina, etc.

OK to be retardedly clear: the blockchain doesn't replace all  laws. Just the ones that can be replaced by the blockchain. Such as fraud via hidden taxation and propaganda.  This would free up resources to deal with violators of other natural laws. Man-made laws can be ignored with anonymizing software and  enlightenment in the future. What part of that don't you understand?  Shall I type more slowly?
Point of further clarification: just because a natural law is reiterated by man doesn't make it a man-made law. It is first and foremost a natural law.

Dark wallet aims to integrate coin mixing into hd wallets to make it trivial for the average Bitcoin user to obscure how they spent their Bitcoin. Other wallet providers are also looking into ways to decentralizing trade so closing down one entities Bank account doesn't have the same effect as closing down an exchange.
Open bazaar allows peer to peer trading without a middleman. Therefore there's no central server to take down and there's no central place where a large amount of escrow Bitcoin is being held.

No the overlords understand Supply and demand, unlike you. Bitcoin is based on the fact that everyone is greedy and aims to be as decentralized as possible, albeit a slow and traitorous process.

Just a thought, I don't really believe it but it's there probably because of Amir Taaki's recent interview... 
Personally, as long as some third party can not arbitrarily print Bitcoin out of thin air I think Bitcoin will prosper. We can't be afraid to experiment as long as we don't stray away from the core principles. So what you can't verify transactions yourself? As long as there's multiple sources out there to turn to for verification there isn't a top down monopoly, unlike the federal reserve which refuses to be audited for example.

As an anarchist I find your statement hilarious. This is a true democracy. Even truer than say the US gov. First of all, I use to be told to move to Somalia if I wanted anarchy and didn't like gov. Ever heard of Cal-exit or Texas or Vermont or the civil war? Those are examples of hard forks. A true democracy isn't civilized like the main stream media and your civics class would have you believe. It's full of protests riots assassinations and "cleansing". True democracy in action: gang rape. 5 guys vote yes and 1 girl votes no. At least bitcoin is regulated to online bickering and trolling.

Right. But once communism is defeated they will lose their power and they won't matter anymore. They are COWARDS which is why they hide behind their puppets in government and the media and corporations and bankers. Once you shrink government, make the msm irrelevant (actually the Internet and their incessant lying is doing that to themselves), smaller government means less power for corporations to lobby making their influence lessened and opening themselves to free market competition and bankers opened to competition by abolishing the Fed. Once these tools are removed there's nothing to allow a handful of people to control the fate of billions

I think there are some valid things that are concerning about bitcoin that have nothing to do with block size or fees. For one the Genesis and early blocks that belong to Satoshi and other early unknown entities. Also what drove James D'Angelo away - you can't prove who owns which mining pools. Looks like a bakers dozen but in reality it could be a handful. I don't let these thoughts bog me down but I think they are valid concerns people used to discuss but not anymore.

You're right. Have you seen the latest video from James D'Angelo? Can you prove 50+% of the mining pools aren't controlled by a single actor?

Or even worse implement proof of stake ...

The only way to make Bitcoin truly decentralized is to make it Asic resistant. Let's go back to satoshi's vision. A miner in every computer. That way we prove there is no collusion of mining pools. We should reboot Bitcoin to change hashing protocol randomly with every block. Or maybe just randomize every 4th block.

The nature of the personal computer is simply not fully understood by companies like Apple (or anyone else for that matter). Apple makes the arrogant assumption of thinking that it knows what you want and need. It, unfortunately, leaves the “why” out of the equation — as in “why would I want this?” The Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called a “mouse”. There is no evidence that people want to use these things. I don’t want one of these new fangled devices.

There tends to be waste when converting from one system to another due to all types of resistance from the technology being refined to the impedance of being used to the old comfortable way of doing things. When these two converge then things move so fast you'll blink and miss the transformation in society. Think blockbuster and netflix. I remember when netflix was mailing dvds. Next thing you know people are able to stream and blockbuster was a relic. 
But yes, the amount of violence avoided through the Silk road alone I'd say is worth all the tea in China, but was more accurately priced by the market...

The real value of Bitcoin is the attempt to decentralize the creation and issuance and policy of currency. Legacy monetary systems may or may not be more efficient at this moment, but that is of no consequence because they are controlled at the top and screw those at the bottom. All the waste in the galaxy would be worth reversing this perversion.

yes, just like Washington stepped down after his second term instead of being "president for life" and setting that precedent.

it's not a 1 to 1 proposition. Different assets can inflate in relation to others at different rates. If you inflate currency today you won't feel it with regard to goods for a while as the inflated dollars circulate in the economy. But people who want to protect their investment will react quickly if they think their bank account is being raided via inflation and will look to park their money elsewhere for long term protection
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:14:46
well neither of us can predict the future only time will tell
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:32:10
Exactly. The only date that is actually relevant is when YOU bought and sold. That's what determines a good from a bad investment.

China is printing money to subsidize companies the additional tariffs imposed by US imports of their products so they don't leave for US or Vietnam, etc. President Trump tweeted this morning that the Fed should print also to debase US currency to keep pressure on China to make a deal. Basic econ says Chinese will flee Chinese currency and Bitcoin is a viable option as seen in the past. If US inflates also investors will seek options and since Bitcoin is already in the upswing it will look favorable

Bread and gallon of milk matters during a recession when people are struggling to make ends meet. When the economy is booming people have more disposable income and they bitch about it but it doesn't affect your day to day.

It's not the only factor. Let's say I invented a cheap way to Retro fit your engine to run on water. Then the price of gas goes to zero. What if climate changes and we can only grow coffee beans in the Arctic. Then coffee prices go up.

and what I'm saying is if bitcoin goes up by $1k due to inflation it'll go up another $1k due to demand, so it's not all inflation, so purchasing power does go up

The best thing about bitcoin is they can't freeze your account remotely like they can your bank and credit cards. Of course you could use cash, but good luck leaving the country with any substantial amount intact. Finally, btc is most useful for the unbanked 6.5 billion in the world, stop just thinking about that small little world you live in.

You've lost me. I thought the issue here was trusting blockchain.info to securely store btc and what logs they keep on your activity. Transaction confirmation is a separate issue that has nothing to do with that site, right? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:37:34
No need to regulate btc. As the market cap grows things like btc credit cards will come into existence and will charge fees for their services to protect you with things like chargebacks.

They would be better at it in a free market instead of the one we have where corporations are protected by government.

That's a good point. Decentralization is also important.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:11:40
The point of btc is that you can have total control of where YOUR money goes, not any government. I have no control how terrorists use THEIR money but holding btc doesn't implicate me like holding dollars do simply through inflation and paying taxes.

My arguments mirror yours for a reason. The use of btc for terrorism is no more an argument against it then the use of dollars for terrorism. Your government may be a terrorist to him, and your terrorist may be a freedom fighter to him. Words are cheap. So what if you're disappointed or not. Your tax dollars kill innocent little kids. Crying about it isn't going to bring them back to life.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:08:45
Can we then conclude that your love of education, roads, infrastructure, airports, public programs, etc.  is greater than your love of human life?
Can we conclude that you would rather have children die needlessly than have your cushy lifestyle interrupted?  That's the ultimate selfishness to me.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:54:45
Terrorism has been around long before btc. Terrorism is a straw man politicians use to control dollars, yet all the aml and kyc laws in the world won't stop terrorism. Their policy is the reason terrorism exists in the first place. It's called blow back. Solve that and then there's no reason to regulate btc or dollars for that matter.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:49:08
If you don't like when innocent people die stop paying taxes.
