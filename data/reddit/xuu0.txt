The double spend problem is when more than one transaction occurs using the same prior transaction and more than exactly one is allowed to happen. The blockchain solves this. Transaction invalidation happens when a double spend is detected. [This actually happens all the time.](
The 51% attack seems to be the boogeyman of bitcoin. I have yet to see any evidence where this attack could cause irreparable harm to bitcoin or provide much incentive to one with this much power. The attack only allows someone to go back in time a handful of blocks to cause a double spend to be recorded. Which would invalidate a previous transaction. 
But the cost to benefit of such an attack is very much out of proportion. If I had the required $1 BN+ invested in infrastructure necessary to perform a transaction invalidation it wouldn't be to refund the 20 mBTC I spent on bed sheets. It would be for a transaction or aggregate of transactions worth much more than what it cost to perform. For that large of a transaction the seller would probably have the coin in escrow for 72 hours, or better, till the next [checkpoint]( is deployed to protect the transaction from invalidation. 
But there lies the problem. If I was buying something worth $1 BN or more with bitcoin I would first have to have an invested interest of 20% or more of the total bitcoin holdings. Not even Satoshi or MtGox have ever been that big of a whale. And *IF* one was to have that level of holdings the obvious benefit would be to strengthen rather than harm the value of investment. 
The other attack that could occur with 51%+ of the hash rate would be to spit out empty blocks slowing transactions from being included.   This would be an attack that has a time limit until the community updates clients to require a [minimum number of transactions to be allowed.]( There will still be transactions included in the 49% of blocks that are generated.  
The hash rate is constantly going up. The already high cost to obtain and maintain the computing power for these attacks would be sunk costs with no real benefit in return. The community has ample resources and ability to face the dangers if the unlikely event were to occur. 
It is probably a more likely scare to have Dorian Nakamoto hiding in your bedroom closet than a 51% attack.

It can disrupt and cause transactions to get lost temporarily.  It can invalidate transactions being sent through double spends. But it cannot steal coin. The instability will cause the attacker to lose money. It would be more profitable to mine for the block rewards. Plus it will then place a huge target on your back from the rest of the community. 
The economics of performing a 51% attack are far worse than being a good actor.

It has taken 4 years to construct plus unknown years of initial planning and legislative wrangling. Because of power issues causing damage it has pushed it out to needing another year to complete. 
If this was the main purpose of the NSA data center with it nearly online that would be the perfect storm to "shut down bitcoin."  But, that would mean that they had intended to "shut down bitcoin" since around the time Satoshi was writing up the Bitcoin whitepaper.
If we were to assume that the NSA data center is the best effort for the most powerful government in the world to create a 51% attack, then it starting today it would take 5+ years and an even more massive data center as the hash rate wont wait around for it to be complete.

You would need to have special purpose commands to do most of the steps. Afaik there isn't a standard command for doing scrypt or the way aes is used without CBC. 
But it would look something like this:
    $ address=&lt;bitcoin address&gt;
    $ privatekey=&lt;private key&gt;
    $ salt=\`echo $address | sha256sum | sha256sum | cut -c 1-4\`
    $ aes_key=\`scrypt-kdf  $privatekey $salt 16384 8 8 512\`
    $ enc_val=\`aesencrypt $privatekey $aes_key\`
    $ enc_val=$salt$enc_val
    $ bip38=\`base58check -e $enc_val\`
    $ echo $bip38
Where the commands [scrypt-kdf]( aesencrypt, and [base58check]( would need to be written. 
I have seen a bash script that would perform all the steps needed to generate a bip38 address but I haven't been able to google it yet. 
[This is a tool that i wrote in Go that can encrypt private keys into BIP38 addresses](
examples of use:
    # Create new bip38 key
    BIP38_PASS=secret bip38tool encrypt new
    # Encrypt private key. the command will prompt for the passphrase.
    bip38tool encrypt -p 5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS
    # Or in the format suggested in your comment. passing the passphrase as environment variable. 
    echo 5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS | BIP38_PASS=secret bip38tool encrypt
    # Encrypt a batch file of keys (one private key per line). The passphrase is passed as an environment variable. 
    cat keyfile | BIP38_PASS=secret bip38tool encrypt batch

if you have the private key it is trivial to calculate the public XY pair. With that one can then calculate the hash for the public address. 
Edit: i guess a point of interest.. the private key is 32 bytes and the hash used for the address is ~~4~~ *20* bytes.. So each bitcoin address would be the same for ~~10^8~~ 10^1.6 private keys... But the signatures would not match.

Right. So only you know how much you have received in all transactions. And those you send to only know how much you have sent them. 
This will make following large numbers of transactions much more difficult. 
If I wanted to be sneaky about sending you 5 XBT I could break it up into a bunch of smaller transactions. Individually they would look like normal spending.  But only you would know they all went to you. 
If I had received them as a number of hidden transactions already they would only show up as unrelated transactions passing from address to address, creating a level of plausible deny ability.

The only thing saying Satoshi is a rule that the smallest value is 8 decimal points. It can easily be set to more if needed. They could easily go from the current 15 total digits to 20 and still use the same int64 they use now. 
It would happen as a rule that after block x the minimum value can now go to 12 decimal points. 
[The FAQ mentions the possibility of going beyond to 16 points.]( though it would require moving to int128 which would allow for a max of 31 decimal places.

Why are all these alt coins using the minimum settings for PoW? Why not have the scrypt variables based on difficulty rate?
Like given a difficulty d:
Find an x, y, z that satisfies x * y * z &gt; d
N = 2^x
r = y
p = z
Then it would be near impossible to just throw an ASIC or GPU onto the network. Because the parameters would require changes to the chips to include more memory or processing as it goes up.

From my understanding, the vast majority of lost transactions are 50 BTC blocks that were mined and never spent. Many of which are the "Satoshi Stash."  Most of the large stashes of wallets that have been lost are a collection of many transactions over Time. The very few that are larger would be similar to big lotteries. 
While it would be a huge windfall for the wining party, it would only "dilute" the total number of active coin a small amount at that point in time. It's not really inflation of the money supply, but encouragement for liquidity and more efficient use of the limited supply of coin. 
I think of it as a gold rush just as the money supply is closing in on the upper limit to encourage the continued mining efforts.

In the protocol, it isn't really saying give x coin to address Y. It says whoever can prove they have the private key for this signature can spend it. 
Which is why you don't need the public key to send money to it. Just a small hash that makes up the address. 
This takes it one step further in that the receiver doesn't need the private key. The means to create the key using a public value stored in the transaction that is paired with a secret seed to create the private key when it is needed.

One thing to remember about ASIC's is that they are optimized to specific parameters for scrypt. Script based altcoins are typically locked at the minimum settings where bip38 uses settings that require much more memory to calculate. 
If an ASIC was built with the memory required complete a bip38 scrypt calculation it would be much more costly.

There is no need to be belligerent towards me. My response was merely that it is "Not safe." 
My reasoning was that a SHA256 by design takes minimal time and resources to generate a cryptographically secure hash. 
Using a known secure method to prevent brute force by require time/memory hard algorithms is not saying that your method is wrong.. just that it could be significantly stronger. 
Also, that the only layer of security you have is knowing the correct combination of words. There are numerous users who have used the default brainwallet.org phrase and [had their coin stolen]( 
to show the strength in increasing computational complexity [see this contest that took 4 months and was only 3 characters long]( Whereas i can calculate every sha256 hash for all 3 byte values in 3 seconds on my old core2duo laptop.

My guess is that it was to discourage mining pools from trying to game the difficulty. By lowering hash rate to make it go down and then spiking up to get a bunch of blocks quickly. 
If I were a big mining operation I would time powering up more hashing power after the difficulty change. If I did it before I would only be working against myself when it goes up. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:32:00
How is that? When the blocks are closer together that means a competing chain would have to work faster in order to over take the main chain. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:55:29
The crash due to hoarding will come when miners no longer get paid for mining. That will only not happen when the market develops to the point where transaction fees can pay for the mining cost. 
There are many competing factors involved. Two that are most apparent are:
Market saturation. Not enough users to make world scale trade happen and not enough merchants to meet world scale demand.  (But interest is growing for both)
Market liquidity. It's too hard to effortlessly buy into the market. (But its getting better)
Price spikes because the liquidity is too rigid for market saturation. 
Hoarding happens because the price going up is the current perceived value. When the true value of exchange for goods and services and the pathway into the market comes to fruition, hoarding will start to fade.

I believe there has been discussion about it not being a replacement as 0038 has value in being used for simple trust less escrow. Also, 0038 allows you to encrypt existing private keys. 
The yet unnamed version is encrypting the random seed that is used for generating n private / public keys. One drawback I see is there isn't really a good way of regenerating the previously generated keys if you only have the base seed. You would have to know all of the branch numbers and key counts.  There is a part of the spec that includes needing to scan the blockchain from the date the seed was generated to recover the keys which seems wasteful IMHO.

spreading it out over a longer period makes that sort of attack much harder and thus not as profitable.

As someone who has actually implemented the bip38 algorithm:
 
The salt that is used to stretch the key is the first four bytes of the double sha256 hash of the bitcoin address. While it is NOT random it will be unique for at least 2^32 addresses. 
This would mean with less than 90 addresses using the same pass phrase you would have a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a collision. 
Even then a collision wouldn't give much information to a would be attacker. And most of the time would be spent running a brute force against scrypt. 
Using it to protect small amounts of bitcoin would mean it costs MORE to crack than it is worth. 
I would probably avoid using for more than a few hundred due to the risk of the $10 wrench exploit.
