bitcoin follows the stocks, generally (imho). . . people have less money when stocks go down, fud happens, and that affects btc. . . hasn't happened yet, but if the stocks stay down for long, i think btc will go down a bit due to pure fud

Zuck bucks lol

again: visa, mastercard, western union, paypal, literally any bank, etc., all provide worldwide trust between any businesses if you need to go the centralized route.

Bungo. It looks like a rebranding of Facebook gift certificates, resold to the masses that don’t yet understand bitcoin/blockchain.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:21:14
Meh..100 is laughably centralized. Their white paper is marketing fluff. ....compared to, for example, satoshi's white paper: there, the problem was set up quickly (double spend attack), and then the solution was presented (bitcoin)...
The libra white paper (like many MANY shitcoin whitepapers) all present some loosely/vaguely defined problem that their coin will miraculously solve. Until they/Zuck can clearly/concretely explain why it's so great: Libra = facebook gift certificates repackaged as a garbage coin.

maybe, maybe not. I have yet to see a non-bitcoin solution that functions better than a non-blockchain counterpart. Sure you can do supply chain management using blockchain, but what problem is that solving? Is blockchain supply chain management better than existing solutions offered by centralized platforms? I def don’t tvjnk so... 
Defi is interesting, but always vaguely described... a common feature of blockchain “solutions”.. hide the alleged novelty and oversell the profit potential. 
Bitcoin was the other way around; Satoshis paper was concrete and to the point: here is the problem (double spend attack) here is the solution (bitcoin architecture). 
Too much vague bullshit out there

It’s just Facebook gift certificate under the guise of blockchain, no? Facebook already tried (and failed) to do a payment system.
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:45:23
Facebook tried this already...No one wanted it. This is a second attempt at "Facebook bucks" that is now being repackaged as a "new" blockchain coin...that is actually centralized so it makes even less sense than facebook credits.
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:43:14
Bungo, I don’t get it at all. I think fb is rebranding their Facebook bucks (those gift certs you can buy at super markets)  under the guise of blockchain.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:59:01
Ahhh yes yup, it was a link buried in the “white paper” page.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:44:07
Your phone isn’t a full node tho. The full blockchain is huge, like 200gb of constantly updated data or something?. Upping the block size would cause more a pain than it’s worth imho.  unless there some obvious benefit that tips the scale toward increasing the size
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:30:45
the "technical paper" thing? i don't think it's hidden is it?  [ 
anywho, yea, in the first paragraph talks alot about how it's "empowering" people to use blockchian, etc., again..loose/vague talk. I don't see any geewhiz problem/solution being solved here, but just another high level marketing gimmic. I'll keep looking, but I see no benefit of buying "facebook gift certificate coin"
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:35:56
I fundamentally don’t understand why private blockchain is a thing, Eg, facebooks Libra coin. 
They control the nodes? Then why not just use PayPal? To me the whole point of blockchain coin is the decentralization; if that’s not part of the architecture then what’s the point? There are private payment networks that are already controlled by one company (eg any bank, PayPal, western union). Am I missing something?
Edit: said another way, fb could have rolled out a PayPal-like payment system into its platform, which would be far easier to manage than a blockchain solution. “Centralized blockchain” is at its core self-contradicting.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:44:38
Interesting How would it?
@_date: 2019-06-18 15:47:31
there's a lack of trust between those partners? That's the issue being solved? I think its a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.
For example, Mastercard doesn't give a crap about whether it "trusts" Visa: if the deal is large enough lawyers are involved anyways; and if the deal isn't large, mastercard has a worldwide payement network, they wouldn't be using Visa for microtransactions.
As for Uber trust facebook: that's not a real global problem, that's a facebook problem, let them solve it (if that problem even exists).
As for uber not "trusting" other partners/businesses: again...that's a problem? show me where.
My issue with facebook coin is that it's (imho) a facebook gift certificate being repackaged as "blockchain" (a pervasive feature of shitcoins).
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:21:22
Didn’t use to be, but shall wear the title with pride. am sick of all these stupid shitcoins allegedly solving some vaguely defined made-up problem, which ends up being a poorly designed useless system or just an outright scam
@_date: 2019-06-18 15:57:37
that kind of logic is what they use in BS marketing pitches:
:::Presents pie chart:::
"look at the market size! We just capture this entire market and boom, we'll all be as rich as oil tycoon jesus, boy howdy"
(conventiently glosses over the analysis as to why those alleged 1.7 billion don't have bank accounts, whether they would use, or even could use ZuckCoin, whether they have any actual money to deposit into bank accounts or ZuckCoin, etc.)
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:45:22
So what? Why would the solution have to be blockchain based??? If it’s just a payment system controlled by one company, then a PayPal-like solution integrated into WhatsApp would be far easier for FB to roll out.
