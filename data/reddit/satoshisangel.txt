You're right, this is not a multisig address. However, there are many moving parts in honoring Hal. Setting up a wallet, drafting a blog post, making the video, editing the video, deciding on the process of how the donated funds will be given to which org (we decided on a community driven and voting process), getting the word out, etc.. That's what we meant by collaboration :) It's a team effort! Hope you'll join us.

BitPay's major role will be in getting the ALS org that the community votes for set up to accept Bitcoin. As you know, ALS Association currently does not.

I love that class! :) But unfortunately, no. Are you a member of the foundation? Members receive discounts to all events and webinars! :) 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:11:42
Thanks so much! We are looking forward to a fantastic day. We've been looking into both options -- streaming and recording. The challenge is the price point! AV (especially good AV) services are so expensive. We'd love any recommendations for more affordable options or someone interested in sponsoring it.

We plan to host one in Europe this year -- whether its the UK or another country is yet to be determined. We'd love to hear from you why UK! :)

Thanks for sharing your perspective 11111one. Everyone is student of something -- whether you're enrolled in formal education or not. The purpose of student pricing for this specific event is to encourage the younger generation of students who are studying computer science or related fields to learn Bitcoin. Young people are one of the keys to mainstream adoption!

Thanks for your input! I'll pass along to our event person for consideration!

Hi Everyone, 
This is Jinyoung with the Bitcoin Foundation and I'm here to provide some facts and clarity on this conversation. 
Here is the link to the blog post. For those that don't want to take the extra step, below is the full post:
Q: Why is there a process to confirm membership for voting and how did it come to pass?
A: In the last election for two industry seats, due to voter apathy, we barely made quorum. The only reason we did was because our volunteer elections chairman, Brian Goss, spent a lot of his personal time nudging industry members to vote so that we could have a quorum to hold a valid election. 
To prevent this from happening again, Brian proposed to incorporate a step that required members to confirm themselves as active to vote for future elections. It's akin to registering to vote. While all citizens have the right to vote, only those registered are able so as to determine a majority. 
This modification to the bylaws was submitted Nov 26, 2014 and the board of directors at the time unanimously approved the modification 5-0 on Dec 16, 2014. Going into this election, every board member knew s/he also had to confirm their membership in order to vote. Board members do not receive special privileges. 
This was shared with the public on a blog post December 19, 2014 (
It is also public on the foundation's bylaws (
There is some misinformation that states "board members" were "excluded" and cannot vote. To be clear, exactly two board members are not voting in this election. One because this board member forgot to confirm in time and the other made a personal choice to abstain from voting. 
Q: Why are only 20% of the total membership confirmed to vote in this election? 
A: Democracy is messy. The hard truth is that many people choose not to vote. 
Here are all the places and methods in which members were provided with information and instructions for this election: 
December 19, 2014 Blog Post (Available to the general public) (
January 20, 2015 Weekly Bits &amp; Bytes Newsletter (Sent to all members) (
January 20, 2015 Bitcoin Foundation Member Forum (Available to the general public) (
February 3, 2015 Weekly Bits &amp; Bytes Newsletter (Sent to all members) (
February 6, 2015 Reminder to Confirm Email titled "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" (Sent to all members) (
February 9 2015 Weekly Bits &amp; Bytes Newsletter (Sent to all members) (
[Documented Complaints]
We use mailchimp to send all official membership correspondence. As a result, we are able to see if a member has or has not received an email and did or did not open it. 
To date, Brian had received 6 official complaints on this public forum thread ( and here are the results of our findings: 
1. Sandy Ressler (sent to Brian via twitter): Sandy is on our membership list and received and opened emails sent on February 3 and February 6. Sandy did receive but did not open emails sent on January 20, or February 9. (Links to all emails provided in section above this section)
2. Bruce Fenton: Received and opened emails sent on January 20, February 6 and February 9. All of which contained information and instructions for the upcoming election. He did receive but did not open the email sent on February 3.
3. John Wnuk: He was unable to open the page due to a faulty browser. Upon Brian's suggestion to use a different one, he was able to open it.
4. Christopher Eli Wilmer: Received emails sent on January 20, February 3, February 6 and February 9. However, he only opened the February 9 email which contained election information and instructions. He did not open the email sent on February 6 titled "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections."
5. Saïvann Carignan: It seems as if Saïvann experienced a software issue. If you experience a technical difficulty, we have no way of knowing unless you reach out to us. Prior to February 11, we did receive emails from a handful of members having a hard time logging in to confirm their membership. Those that reached out to us for tech support received it and were able to confirm. We are still investigating Saïvann's situation.
6. Tim Forbrook: True identities are important to protect the integrity of the vote. Tim was unwilling to provide his/her true identity and therefore we cannot prove s/he is an active member. 
We make every effort to communicate directly to our membership while trying not to spam our members. We believe a weekly email leading up to the election in addition to one specific email about confirming membership, in addition to the forum and blog post was sufficient notice. 
We acknowledge there are many informal channels of communication within the bitcoin community. However, we make every effort to send official member communication via email directly to members to the email addresses provided. 
We also acknowledge that in some cases there may have been technical difficulties. If you have not been receiving our weekly Bits &amp; Bytes newsletter or any other mailings, please email membership immediately so that we can help identify the problem and update your email address. 
At the end of the day, we can provide information and instructions, but it is up to the member to decide if he or she wants to engage in the democratic process. Our elections are also run by a volunteer chairperson and while we would prefer voting with and on the block chain, that currently does not exist. Until then, we are left with somewhat imperfect systems and imperfect people. We appreciate your patience and look forward to working together to improve the process for future elections.  
If you have ideas for improving the process for future elections, we want to hear them. Please email your ideas to membership Thank you.

Bruce, at the time of writing, there were 6 on the public forum thread that we spent all day yesterday getting to the bottom of trying to find the point of failure. I've asked Brian to keep me updated on additional complaints and we will examine each with the same level of care. We are trying to be as transparent with the facts as possible.

Good morning! Here are the results of the election &gt;&gt; Election Runoff 
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:18:17
We have quorum! :) 
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:11:33
Hi Everyone! Jinyoung from Bitcoin Foundation here. We are rebooting the runoff election and moving forward with Helios. More info on the blog post:   For those that are members and ran into issues using swarm, can you send us your feedback and suggestions (what worked, didn't work, what you like/hate) to support We want to make sure we collect all the feedback so as to improve the system. Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:43:39
Bitcoin Foundation members who confirmed in time to vote, don't forget that polls close tonight, Thursday, Feb 19 at 11:59pm EST. So far 313 out of 364 votes have been cast!
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:13:38
Hi Bruce. The reason why Brian uses the forum thread as an official way to receive and respond to issues is because we need a transparent way to verify membership. If a non-member complains about not being able to vote, well, that just doesn't make sense, does it? :) 
Brian is also a volunteer so by requesting people to contact him via this public forum, he can have some assurance that they are members and we can help verify membership. That said, we are open to better ideas and open to improving the process! What would you suggest? 
As to the "five candidates" you mentioned, it's actually four candidates that did not confirm in time to vote even though they received all the emails and notices in their inboxes. I cannot speak for them as to why they did not open or read our emails.
The website has been undergoing some construction so while some pages are not completely up to date, our blog is. We used to have a search feature on the previous blog platform but we recently moved from wordpress to ghost so that feature is no longer available. It's not ideal so we are looking at finding ways to improve that. 
Bruce, no one is blaming anyone. The fact remains that in addition to public forums, we sent emails directly into our members' inboxes and some people chose not to open or read these messages. Board Directors for the Bitcoin Foundation are elected by the membership. So we communicated directly with our members, in addition to the public messages on the foundation blog and foundation member forum. I'm not opposed to posting more information on reddit moving forward. Perhaps we can either set up a subreddit for the foundation? Would that help? 
The fact also remains that we sent an email with the subject heading "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" and some people still chose not to open the email. 
And that email does explicitly mention the activation process. It reads verbatim ( 
During February 13-17, 2015, we will be having an election for two individual board seats. In order to be eligible to vote in these elections, you have to be an individual member (industry membership does not count).
If you are an industry member but would like to vote, you will need to become an individual member. Individual memberships are $25/year or $250/lifetime. To join, visit 
If you are not sure if your membership is active, please email membership 
If you need to renew your membership, you can do so here.
Today (Friday, Feb 6) is the last day to join or renew your membership to be eligible for this election.
Also, as per our bylaws, members who wish to participate in voting need to confirm their status as active members.  For further information on why, see this pull request.
I want to vote, how do I confirm myself as an active member?
Simple.  Login to  click on the “Election” tab, and follow the on screen instructions.
When is the deadline to confirm myself as an active member?
Please note that new members must join by February 6th to get voting rights. February 10th is the last day for current members to confirm as an active member. After that we cannot guarantee that you’ll receive a ballot, but we will try.
Where can I find out more information about the election?
You can find more information by reading this blog post.
The confirmed and final list of candidates eligible for an individual board seat will be announced in an elections mailing next week. Stay tuned!
