I wouldn't mind essentially a biometric lock that signs your private keys, Either full left or right hand ( in case you lose one) and a heart rate sensor that wont go through if it shows you're under extreme stress ( ie gunpoint).

I think that is what the Request network is working on, but I'm not sure

I might just do this with a portion of my PMs. It's unlikely silver will ever move like crypto. I was a bit of a bagholder on its move to $50. I may be able to get a little more for numismatic value if I find the right buyers though

Purely speculation. It's just a thought that I'd like to unpack. I've heard it mentioned that the top 100 aren't selling, or are accumulating. I'm trying to think of how good of an indicator it may be of bitcoin health.  I want to say yes, but I doubt it's that simple. It would take someone analyzing the top 500 addresses and looking at ones that have been transacting ( some might be lost addresses) and analyze the data

So it seems that the rich list isn't a great indicator , and shouldn't be used to solely determine if bitcoin is healthy or not. Would anyone say that it has any indication at all?
Very hard to reconcile here because if you look at top dormant for 5 years addresses , The top one is in the top 5 richest BTC addresses. at 79957 BTC and it hasnt been accessed in 5 years!  The top 100 dormant all have over 1000BTC and there is only barely over 1600 addresses with over 1000 BTC It starts to narrow things down. With exchanges having more than one wallet and  the amount of exchanges out there, it does show signs that these high rollers are more likely exchanges or related businesses.
I'm still not sure what this information tells us though.
I think shaky data at best is quite reasonable.

Some addresses you see trading and either ending up with more money and the same BTC or more BTC. Some have less, but still over 90% of their portfolio. But yea, some haven't been active since 2014 some 2012. etc.

Chances are, these are one of few bitcoin addresses per person which would imply that the richest have a lot more than the richest bitcoin address

I'm kind of a bit of a skeptic because I drank the kool-aid at 20K  Slowly Dollar cost averaged in in  till around 15 K. I didn't worry about it untill it got below 10 K then I thought fuck it. I was buying up there. Doubled my holdings around 6-8K.  I'm tempted to pull away once I get made whole again, but that part of me worries  that I'll miss out on a huge wealth transfer.
I very much believe in bitcoin, but its Humanity I'm a little more worried about ruining it like they tend to do.

 How do you mean? I think that the "rich list" is one of the interesting tools of the blockchain, it is very easy to keep track of transactions and balances. Even if you can't easily determine who is performing these transactions, it can help give insight onto BTC usage and demographics in the future. For now it can work a a potentially effective indicator on sentiment. Or it couldnt.

To be honest, If I got in 6 months earlier, I'd be over the moon. If I got in today, I'd probably be a lot more confident. So that brings up a good point. 
I'm already down on the initial investment. I have this unshakeable thought, that money is hard earned and that trying to make money through an investment of some kind won't happen to me.
 But realistically, the outlook and development of crypto has never been better. This kind of recovery is amazing. I've already almost been made whole from buying at the bottom.

 I would argue that the opportunities  are mostly luck, but if you're able to take advantage of these opportunities and keep a job or move up etc, that is in part to your ability to persevere in  a given environment. If you compare yourself to another version of yourself, or people with similar opportunities. It can be fair to say  something about it.

But addresses usually belong to people. It doesn't necessarily change the question.

I guess I don't mean that people are stupid for having insurance. But moreso that people are used to someone bigger than themselves cleaning up their mess whether its their fault or not.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:47:55
Yea, I can understand that. The thing is, it could be useful, but it could not be useful at all. We can only guess which addresses are actual investors and which ones are just either long term holders or someone given 10K btc when it was pennies and lost their private keys. 
That being said, Sentiment remains high with the larger btc balances. 
The other point is, unless you are tracking it constantly, someone who sold all their btc won't show up in the rich list. So there is that.
Now I think i'm saying a whole lot of nothing.

Yea, It's hard to determine, since BCC was always a Ponzi from day one. Bitcoin does have a lot of promise, but is a threat to and threatened by the current financial system. The other thing, is people in the masses may not want to leave the current system. 
So it has threats to its survival that if combined into a deadly combination, could deliver a lethal blow to crypto.
But I have a hard time believing that people with that much money wouldn't have their ear to the ground on this stuff. It wouldnt seem that someone with 100 million in BTC ( That is the 100th richest) would be okay with losing it all. Obviously whoever owns this has accrued much more than 100 million, since that is only bitcoin holdings, and could be one of many wallets. There are 19 wallets with exactly 10,000 BTC seems a little odd.
What I'm trying to say is a person with that much money is usually intelligent enough to not lose it, and furthermore, increase it's value.
TL:DR Rich guy know how to keep his money maybe?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:24:04
I would think putting a ledger in a bank vault defeats the purpose of keeping money out of the banks, if they decide not to let you in, then you have the same issue as fiat.

Interesting take. I kind of understand what you mean. People getting in early are really more in it to make money and taking risk. If it gets adopted, you will be able to use it without the risk of it going to zero. 
But early adopters are required for any market, and they take the biggest risk and usually reap the biggest rewards.
I'm not sure smart is the right word, I think they are risk-averse

Yea I guess the other good point is I don't really believe in my country's dollar anymore (Canada). Everything is increasing in value, quite drastically lately. We used to be at parity with US dollar and now we are 80%.
 I used to be a silver bug and was told about bitcoin in 2010 and shrugged it off. I thought well thats cool, but I don't really understand it. One of my biggest regrets now looking back.
 I believe in bitcoin a lot more than our countries abilities to preserve our wealth.  Even if BTC levels out and follows dollar inflation ( which I think is the goal once full adoption is reached, that would be ideal.
The only reason these massive gains exist is because of the supply and demand of it all when it isn't fully adopted from the beginning
