Well, sure, but that's comparing it to it's ATH which lasted a couple weeks. But yeah, as another comment said the British pound wasn't used as a store for value like BTC so there isn't a good way to compare them to begin with.

what are those numbers
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:41:02
one unit of bitcoin is one bitcoin. one unit of satoshi is one satoshi. so "what is satoshi" would not be correct ;)
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:43:11
dont let anyone hear this, but you can say "the *then* ATH" and be correct. good luck with ninja edits ^^^im ^^^out

*the internet* was not for the average Joe. Same as the computer or smartphones. But now 3 year old kids can get their hands on them and get used to them in a ridiculous amount of time. While we progress as humanity, we get used to very complex stuff from a very young age. I believe this will happen again and it will keep happening for other things too.
