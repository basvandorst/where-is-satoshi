Wait are you saying shills are wasting time?  Don't shills get paid?

If I asked a 5 year old, a 10 year old, and a 15 year old CHILD, how many currencies called Bitcoin are there and showed them the front page of coinmarketcap, how many do you think they would say?

It seems like you're super knowledgable Pepe!  Do you know which side holds responsibility for fees related to channel drops?  
I guess I'm asking: If my connection point is unstable to people trying to join the "Lightning Network" of nodes, doesn't that benefit me?

Is there a maximum amount of channels you can have open at once for current wallet software?  Do funds need to be allocated from my wallet into the channel as it opens?  Seems pretty cool if I don't need to put all the money I'll ever spend at Steam when I open the channel!  Oh and who's responsible for fees if the channel gets dropped?  Is there a mechanism to tell who performed the channel drop?
Pretty cool!

If you link one we'll fucking ban you!

How do you de-incentivize purposefully closing a channel to regenerate fees?

fuck the banks.  Take out loans.  Withdraw all cash.  Invest in crypto.
Oh and don't be retarded; natural selection is a bitch.

How much were the fees?  What was the cost per hour of having an open Lightning channel?

I'm feeling lazy.  Can we just get the bots to do it? /s

Here's an interpretation I made up!  
Basically, the end of the year crash is being caused by tax changes (cascading from the masses selling to the whales selling).
If you don't believe the US has a disproportionate amount of access to Bitcoin, then I don't have time to convince you.  This is why the calendar year matters.
The announced changes to cryptocurrency trading caused a bunch of tax FUD by people who actually intend on paying the appropriate US crypto trading taxes.  
Like Buffett publicly said, people waited until news of the tax cuts going through or not to take losses (not profits).  Basically, writing off the losses to use against next years (deferred) gains.
Buffett interview.  He makes the point at 7:33.  Link with time stamp 
EDIT: the real whales are not purely crypto and equities generally killed it this year.
