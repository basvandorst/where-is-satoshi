Do we need this many Bitcoin tracking apps? Feels like these posts are becoming an everyday thing.

I see a lot of people saying it took a long time. I sent a scan of my driver's license and they confirmed my ID in under 10 minutes. This was at least 3 or 4 months ago, so maybe they're backed up due to Coinbase being no longer viable.
I have another friend who submitted his info and by the time he tabbed back into his Gmail it was confirmed, probably a month ago.

Which banks? My bank hasn't had any issue with me moving funds, and they're what I would call a "Big Bank" in the sense that they may in the future take a stance on it.
I suspect a lot of people are receiving flack from sketchy bank transfers to shoddy exchanges. Your bank isn't gonna want you to transfer $70k to an exchange that will potentially hold your money for an indefinite amount of time with little/no recourse. They might actually be doing you a favor.

Erm, multiple tickers/charts already do this. Bitcoinity has been doing this since Bitcoin hit $1000.

Yeah, especially with something that produces a lot of smoke like a blunt, you don't even have to fully inhale to still get some of the effect.
Although, obviously y'know, inhale dat shit.

The tinfoil hat part of me says they see it as an easy opportunity way to make money. I don't think Roger Ver &amp; Co. really have the good of the crypto ecosystem in mind at all. Ver himself has proven he thinks very heavily about his networth, as if that's some kind of indicator of intelligence. I don't think the mentality of an innovator should be, "I'm gonna get rich quick in these three easy steps!"

This is the most important part I bring up when other people talk to me about BCH. It solved the problem now, *today*, at the cost of weakening our current system, but once it reaches the same scale (assuming it can even get there) there's nothing at all to prevent the same issues from occurring. People who see the positive in this are looking way too short-term and not thinking about the issues of cryptocurrency's current on-chain solutions. BCH is a band-aid when we need a surgery.
I'm hoping the Lightning devs, and other, less short-sighted/less greedy folks will figure out a new way to handle things.
In general, I think a majority of the [**1380**+]( cryptocurrencies are trying to make short-term cash out of what could be a long-term solution to fiat as we know it. BCH is just another one of the many.

LastPass, 2FA and ad-blockers make this, and pretty much all phishing sites, total non-issues. I strongly, *strongly* recommend them to regular computer users, but especially if you're doing sensitive stuff with bank accounts, wallets, and finances where transfers are potentially irreversible (ie: BTC transactions.)

I think you intentionally cropped out the stop sign because the likeness was too similar.
He couldn't find a round piece of cardboard? Or like, manufacture one? This is like BitcoinMan when BTC is worth $50/unit.

Find a Bitcoin casino and lay it all on a single hand in blackjack.
I kid of course, that's a really terrible idea. But congrats on your windfall OP, that's a solid hunk of coin you just reacquired.

Uh yeah, I didn't know he was doing "Bitcoin training seminars" and I'm guessing nobody else did until they saw this post.
This shit should be removed, this seems like a blatant way to draw more attention to his shit cause.

And maybe we should just disallow app advertisements in this sub, because, y'know.. it leads to dishonesty and shit like this.

I can't say 100% sure, but I'm pretty confident.
Among other things, if someone's capable of accessing my Mycelium wallet through a wi-fi connection, they're capable of accessing another, lower-hanging fruit. As far as I know, there's no way someone could start up the app and send themselves my BTC without me noticing, even if they were directly remotely connected to my phone (which I know is possible, but usually requires an additional app, permissions, etc..)
Basically, if someone's gonna go through the effort of stealing BTC there are loads of other people with easier-to-access coins out there. If I were a potential scumbag I'd go with spoofing a SIM card of a known BTC-holder and trying to get into their Coinbase by getting past their 2FA. That'd probably be the swiftest route to jacking someone's BTC.

I don't get this post. Put all that money you were going to spend on killing yourself into Bitcoin. This is the best sale I've seen for at least 2 months.

Took me less than ten minutes, and I'm a US citizen. Took my friend less than a minute and he's a non-native US citizen. I'm guessing you just sent them an ID they couldn't automatically verify.

You can do what you will, but John McAfee is avidly paranoid about *everything*. He has predicted a lot of things will happen that haven't. He's not maliciously wackadoo, but he is certainly an interesting character.
Also, you're saying, "Don't store your CC's on a place that you have complete control of because you can't properly protect it," but you advise buying a *physical* wallet which can break, be stolen, or simply get lost with absolutely no recourse? Bit backwards.

In the same sense, in order to get to my Mycelium wallet you'd have to go through 2FA and know something like 16 passphrase words.
I'll take my chances.

Uh, if you're using Coinbase Pro, then this doesn't affect you anyway. Gemini is still the better exchange even with this change unless you have a corporate account. In which case, you're able to get low fees pretty much wherever you're doing your high volume trading.

There is none, and I probably wouldn't personally, but it's just a testament to Bitcoin actually becoming more prevalent. I've seen lots of posts with ATM's and even banks in Europe, but to be fair currency exchange kiosks are also relatively common in most of those places too. Seeing a Bitcoin ATM where there's no currency exchange location nearby seems like a whole different ballpark of "mainstream-ity."
But in general, all of these Bitcoin ATM's/exchange spots will use some exchange, they may even quote the Coinbase/bitfinex/bitstamp. price, but usually they'll tack on a decent fee, similar to how an ATM may charge you a "convenience fee" if it doesn't belong to your specific bank.
Personally I use Gemini, and I encourage everyone else I know to do the same.

This was actually the first I had seen, and it was about 2 weeks ago when the price was about its lowest. It was a nice glimmer of hope amidst all the madness.
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:18:42
I'd say that interpretation is debatable. I don't always go to the ATM to withdraw cash money. Sometimes I'm depositing checks, sometimes (well, back before online banking) I'd just be moving money around from account to account, taking my cash money and depositing it back into my account during the days when I'd get paid cash. So all of those can sorta fit under things you'd do with your fiat cash at a "Bitcoin ATM" or whatever you wanna call it.
It's an "Automatic Teller Machine" so I guess it's not an entirely appropriate term for it. "Bitcoin Exchange Machine" might be more accurate? Or something like that? I dunno, I titled it the first thing that seemed most appropriate. Most people here in the states would colloquially refer to it as a "Bitcoin ATM" or "Bitcoin machine" probably.

This was in Montclair, NJ I think. I was doing some contract work by the college (MSU) and went to a burger place called Stuffed Burger after. I was literally looking up from glancing at the price on my phone and I spotted this in the window in the convenience store next door.
Also, the burger was delicious.
