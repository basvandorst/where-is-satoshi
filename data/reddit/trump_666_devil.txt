You can design/build miners.  Sure, it's expensive, but it's worth it.   My idea for a miner is to trade speed for efficiency and run it on a 22FD-SOI chip instead of 14nm FinFET.  The mask and design costs are less than half as much, power usage is 1/4 as much.   They should be pretty fast, and you can always add more.   I haven't run the numbers, but it seems like you could start something for maybe $10-15 million.

This reminds me today I spent 50 satoshis to put this on the blocklchain in support of 4mb blocks; "Girl you look good, won't you (Adam) back that ass up, you's a big fine woman, (Adam) back that ass up, call me big Daddy, won't you (adam) back that ass up, girl who is you playing with, (adam) back that ass up."

the problem with chip scaling, is the more complex they get, development costs approach infinity.  Already, a new 14nm FinFET chip costs almost $100 million for a processor or GPU for design/manufacture and mask costs.  ASICs are cheaper, less complexity, but still, at some point simplicity and power savings will outpace raw speed, especially for mining.   The obvious answer would be FD-SOI(Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator) at 20 and later 12nm, power savings with very little loss of performance, and they are radiation shielded.  With back body biasing, they can be tuned to adjust for difficulty as well.

advances in SSD memory production(fabs in China coming online) will soon eclipse HDs in size and price, along with 3d chip packaging.  I'd say 100TB for $300 in 10 years.   The thing about memory, is the cells just stack deeper and deeper, and the mask levels are just repeats of each other.

@_date: 2017-08-08 15:10:49
that's impossible, because you can't make ASICs without high end semiconductor tools, which North Korea has no hope of ever obtaining.  ASML, KLA/Tencor, Teradyne, etc. can't and won't sell them those things.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:14:12
it can be pruned, or downloaded when convenient.  New memory fabs are being built in China, which should bring SSDs down in price.

I'm not dumping the 1x chain, or trading during the hard fork, so it's meaningless to me.  There is only one chain, my friend, we shall see.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe you are right, I am not a fanatic, just a fan of the opposition.  People will abandon bitcoin if it doesn't scale, there isn't enough demand.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:08:51
Bitcoin Cash is great, low fees, no segwit, closer to Satoshi's vision, 8mb blocks that scale to 32mb.  How is 2mb segwit even contentious? lol your a bunch of baby little candy asses who shouldn't use bitcoin, and don't even get me started on Core.

So you're saying the network is ok without a blocksize increase?  I have been involved with Bitcoin since early 2012, and blocksize increase has always been a part of the roadmap.  Frankly, I'd be surprised if Core doesn't elect to increase it in the next year.  We can all get behind that, can't we? I'm 100% in.

about 26GiB per year per 0.5MB, so ~25GB, 50GB, 75GB, 100GB, etc...
now, I've heard from some people that they don't think SSD prices have an effect on storage, but there's at least 3 fabs being built for memory in Asia right now, and chips are the future of storage.  1TB HDs won't be competitive with SSDs in 5 years, memory can be made in a a lights out fab, where the chips just get shuttled from op to op with robots.  Logic and RF guys are pretty jealous of them, I make chips so that's my expertise.

I'm pretty sure there aren't really many holdouts who have the option to use Segwit, I understand we can get another 500k or so with it per MB.   There needs to be more space now, for sidechains and hubs to work, we can't incentivise them at users expense.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:53:56
I am just a bitcoin enthusiast like you, my friend.  There's only one chain, whether it's 1mb or 2mb, I'm going to spend less on my payments if it's only 1mb, but it is just speculation at this point.  Maybe I have had too much kool-aid, I'm not terribly worried, I just love bitcoin, but if I have to pay a $7 fee every time and wait two hours, maybe I will start using bitcoin cash or monero.

Segwit is only a ~1.7x capacity increase, 2x turns this into 3.4x, enough for a while.

RAM density has increased, price has not because there are fewer players.  
 Now that RAM cannot easily be scaled below 14/16nm, more fabs are coming online to supply it. The market will drop in time, it is not as expensive to make as CPUs/GPUs are.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:51:15
I really wonder, if Blockstream has no stake in the scaling debate, why Adam Back and Samson Mow can't stop tweeting about it?  this should be tertiary to their business, it is bad business to take sides and attack over something they have no stake in.

I'm not a Dev, but I'll relay your msg.  BTW, replay protection is overrated, you just want it so you can continue the narrative that S2X is an attack, rather than an upgrade.  Adam Back personally told me that the only reason for small blocks is to avoid 100mb blocks, which I find hilarious.  Assuming 100% Segwit use, we are talking about 3.4mb blocks, 2.1mb at current use for S2X.

That wouldn't even cover mask costs at 7nm, which is ≥ 60 for an ASIC, at $20k each that's two million right there.  It could get the ball rolling, and design tools are automated these days, so it would be a start, but you would need twenty times that to produce at volume.   Tool time is expensive at the leading edge.

Sovereign citizens? if that's what you call yourself, more power to ya.   You just need to mine, one hash one vote.  There is no possible way that 2x will centralise anything, I've done my research, and other than a few nodes not keeping up, I'm not seeing it.  This whole no2x thing seems like a temper tantrum by a few hobbiests, that represent a small fraction of users(like 10%.) The thing about us moderate blockers, is that we don't go around screaming slogans or talking points, because we know this isn't even a contentious issue.  Instead of uniting the community against real attacks, the small blockers are picking the wrong fight.

With all due respect, Mr. Back, I'll take my 2MB(4-8 Weighted.)  I'm not in favor of 20MB+ blocks, anytime in the next 5-10 years.  I work in semiconductors, I've worked on  processors much faster than anything off the shelf, and I know that the next great leap will be very expensive.   One MB is just too small, it's insulting, frankly, and the people deserve a real compromise.  Perhaps you can understand that we are trading utility for next to nothing?

'Bcash' isn't a thing, BCH is, and I hope it succeeds because no one in their right mind would pay $10, let alone $20 on a TX.   The banking system will eat bitcoin's lunch if it doesn't evolve.

Yes, it is a weak argument.

Right now, Bitcoin is not scaling, whether due to conflicts of interest, conservativism, or fear of change.   It could also be, that the developers aren't interested in scaling right now.

I make chips for GF.  First, the customer designs the chips using software, then GF's design implementation team decides which steps do which process, and photomasks are ordered(mfg in the Burlington Mask House.)  This takes a couple months.  Then tool time is scheduled, and production begins.   Price = (Mask Levels x Tool Time) / (X / quantity) where X is secret customer price(AFAIK not my specialty.)
     ASICs use less levels than more complex logic parts, but 14nm is expensive, you would need maybe $2 million just for the photomasks alone.  It can be done, however.

You are correct, but it is more the core developers working on side projects than blockstream proper being the problem.  2mb blocks would keep us good till the end of the year, but we can't have nice things.  This is more an issue of ego rather than greed, IMO, "My scaling solution is better than yours."
