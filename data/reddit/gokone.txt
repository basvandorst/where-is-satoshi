Why the negativity to something so positive?
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:50:49
This is the level of pettiness they stoop down to? I see this shit happen in penny stocks and it looks like a goddamn playground for irresponsible children. Bitcoin is being treated well, cared for and analyzed day to day, promoted in everyone’s favor, only to have a baby come in and leave comments like these?
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:07:20
No. Anything that digresses from a regular checkout process is deemed untrustworthy by a potential customer. A regular checkout process  has ‘expected behavior’. The ranks of Paypal, Amazon and Apple Pay have one click checkouts. Entering a credit card is also expected. Digressing from this would mean an immediate drop off. Coinbase did its best to make it look native to the process.

How would you recommend I accept bitcoin on my store?
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:25:25
It's on the last step of checkout, after entering shipping info :)
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:25:04
Kind words. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:57:38
Shopify is against coinbase? BCH is unselected. Coinbase makes it easy for the customer. This isn't a storage mechanism, it's an e-commerce transaction mechanism.

Checkout.liquid is the file that handles the final transaction and is locked for non enterprise merchants. You can only modify the color scheme and banner otherwise.
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:50:57
This is exactly what I'm talking about. The Lightning breed is completely different. Thank you kind sir, I truly appreciate the comments and the support!
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:33:21
 How is this helping Bitcoin in any way? Here have some ❤️
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:59:17
Thanks man! It's expected. But when did logic go down the toilet?
@_date: 2019-10-30 22:18:36
Great news! Haters coming in 3... 2...
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:08:59
It’s there! Last step of checkout
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:41:37
[Shop here!](perkclothing.com) Now taking lightning too. Payment option is on the last step of checkout, right after entering shipping info :)
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:30:18
OMG dude
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:01:47
I only have those options in the screenshot available to me! Sorry man
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:04:33
I shall enable them :)
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:59:52
Looks like there's an integration! 
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:03:18
Not many, and Shopify themselves has said it hasn’t picked up. This is expected though. No one wants to spend their crypto, which is fine. No fees to accept crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:26:43
Coinbase commerce with Shopify. The integration is as seamless and painless as you'd expect from any other Shopify payment method. Truly is a thing of beauty. Checkout is a breeze, and the order is marked as unpaid until fully verified, so my warehouse doesn't receive the order until then. It works perfectly for e-commerce.
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:05:36
It’s unselected!
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:58:00
Looking into it now! Thanks mate
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:40:31
I got opennode installed right now. On chain and lightning baby
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:03:58
Coinbase commerce. Easy plug and play. Looking into opennode now, and it looks like it’s plug and play as well :)
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:04:18
Working on it with Opennode!
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:23:52
It's... unselected, as clearly shown in the picture and footer logos �� I completely agree with you though, and it's exactly why I'm not accepting that payment method.
Edit: ok now I don't agree with you. E-commerce is about trust with the customer. Making the process easy and transparent for them is only feasible with native integrations with trusted intermediaries. I might as well remove it if it'll be a hassle. How else am I to accept Bitcoin? E-mail the customer and send them my wallet address? C'mon man, get serious.
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:23:17
No integration offered yet.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:01:15
Those are one click checkouts. Credit cards, bitcoin, and installment payments are on the very last step of the checkout process :)
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:56:53
Coinbase commerce. They offer a native integration. Makes it seamless for the customer.
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:52:27
We ship to Switzerland. Free shipping over $100 :)

There we go!! The revolution will be televised ✊
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:18:54
It’s not even an option at my store
@_date: 2019-10-31 04:46:53
Happy to be of service my man

All of Reddit in a nutshell ��

How do you recover bitcoin using only a recovery phrase? Say I have it in a wallet like Electrum and I lose the computer.. or say I have it on a wallet in my iphone. How does a brand new computer know about the contents of a lost wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:05:44
You sir, are a champion. Thank you for the clear and concise explanation.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:17:35
I saw it this morning. Makes reference to a wsj article as well, which is even bigger news!
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:03:01
Agreed! Tremendous exposure for Bitcoin. It can’t be stopped anyways.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:44:43
Yea, we're at $8000. What are you referring to?
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:23:18
It’s the Lightning Network that runs on top of bitcoin. Basically people hold bitcoin in nodes and the lightning network uses them. I think.
@_date: 2019-05-13 04:32:46
I finally got the explanation I needed! Thank you :) This was the only way to get a proper answer... by being corrected.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:52:38
You don’t believe in bitcoin, and yet you buy bitcoin as a speculative play. You got burned. Meanwhile, hodlers from years ago have made tons of returns. You don’t understand scarcity and you think your cash is worth something... it’s actually not. This is an up and down market, with a general trend upwards. Millions of people are climbing on board. I keep some stored as a store of value and it’s helped me hedge against the falling usd. Lightning takes care of all your concerns. It uses electricity? So does banking. Gold is terribly inconvenient to divide and transport. It’s super expensive to store. You’re paying interest in your purchases with a credit card that has created ghost money out of thin air. Bankers are making billions worldwide on this very idea.

It is my belief that this halving price increase expectation is or will be priced in sooner than you expect. The pattern looks so obvious that everyone is taking notice now and are buying accordingly. I believe this is the price increase we’re seeing. I expect it to drop short term, rise again with renewed expectations of the halving, then drop when nothing happens. Then who the fuck knows what happens ��
