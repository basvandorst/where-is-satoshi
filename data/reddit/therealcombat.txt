Pretty much ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

... until they say it's the only real bitcoin and that core is "classic" and that the new fork is the future.

I've got an idea: Why don't you guys quit worrying about a destination and instead enjoy the ride. When you're breathing your last breath would you rather be thinking about millions you can't take with you or thinking about the ride you had, lives you touched, and the people that will miss you when you're gone?

No. Steve started NeXT as a new company with new code. The OS lives on in OS X because Apple later bought NeXT and made that OS their own.

Just scroll down the readme to the installation section. There's a linux deb file, windows installer and a windows zip. I'll create an osx version too if people ask for it.
Just unzip the windows zip file and run the exe.
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run `npm install` (requires nodejs), then `npm start`

[That's not how it works]( Mnemonic codes are used for deterministic key generation. You can't encrypt data with a symmetric algorithm and have a mnemonic code as the result.

It is javascript. I hate java. It's running on [electron](

That's why you print it out. That's also why it creates a QR code for you so you can just scan it.

I understand exactly what the purpose of verifying the hash is. It's just that since you've disconnected all means of exposing your seed, it seems redundant.
EDIT: I supposed it's possible to have a compromised version of openssl but that seems extremely unlikely. Paranoid, indeed.

It's really not that difficult to do right.  
1. Put Ubuntu on a thumb drive  
2. shutdown computer  
3. disconnect computer from wifi/network  
4. disconnect hard drive  
5. boot from thumb drive  
6. You have a clean environment to work in  
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:22:25
Well, if you're disconnected from the internet and other storage mediums, what could possibly happen? I could be wrong, but it seems like a redundant step.

Unless you use an offline computer or a distro like qubes with on offline vm.

Your phone would only see the encrypted blob so I don't know what you're scared about there.
Besides, in the event you lose your wallet and need to recover it you should always immediately move all your funds to a new wallet and discard the old one. It's amazing how much FUD there is in this sub.

Sure, consuming all of your RAM forces the OS to use the page file (high HDD activity). So having MORE RAM is good for long battery life. As are SSD's.

I built my workstation in 2013 and I still have 16GB of RAM. I don't understand why people complain about electron anymore. Are you trying to run this on a potato or something?
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:22:22
Wow. I just looked at apple's site. Doesn't look like more RAM is even an option when ordering. What crap. Why do people buy them again?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:07:41
That's just not true. Hardware continues to get faster and faster. It's reached a point where we don't waste much time optimizing code anymore when a fucking cell phone can run it.
Electron is awesome because it makes writing simple cross-platform apps super easy. Wouldn't you rather have an app that uses a little more RAM than not have it at all because it wasn't written for your platform?

My laptop gets more than 9 hours of work on a charge. So yeah, i'm good.

What's wrong with Linux? After using all 3 extensively for many years, I can't stand anything else.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:38:46
I initially went full Linux around the same time. You are right about the issues you describe. However, it has come a long way, and while still not as easy/simple as OSX, it's not too bad now.
I went full OSX around 2008 as well (so I could develop for the iPhone). It was ok at first, but I eventually shit canned it (and the app store... fuck you, Apple). Don't get me wrong, it's worlds better than Windows, but I still hate it.
If you are feeling adventurous, you may want to take a look at [Linux Mint]( It's built on Ubuntu, but without that Unity shit.

I think we disagree on what "huge" usage is. Electron apps usually use around 200-250mb of RAM. If it used 2-2.5GB, I'd have issue with it. But at it's current usage, I certainly don't care. Especially when otherwise it wouldn't be available for my OS.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:13:02
RAM uses the same energy whether you're using 25% or 100% of it.

A friend of mine recently switched jobs. His new employer was having him build an iOS app. I asked him what they would do if the App Stored didn't approve it. He didn't know.
Last I asked him about it, he'd been trying to get it approved for a month with no success.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:23:46
Well, no I really don't care that much about battery life. I just buy laptops with huge battery life to begin with. I have Linux on my laptop and it gets around 9 hours of actual work before the battery dies.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:40:52
I've got 17 different docker containers running, 4 open projects in atom + several other electron apps such as slack running, numerous firefox &amp; chrome windows/tabs open, a slew of terminals open, etc.
With all that, I'm only using 9GB of RAM (60%) and this is a 5 year old computer! You're complaining about a non-issue. Even cell phones these days have 3-4GB of RAM. Maybe it's time to upgrade your laptop?
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:34:15
I used to do iOS/Mac apps, but got sick of it. Every time I pushed an update, the approvers would take issue with some aspect of the app that was already in the current version on the store. Either Apple would come up with a new rule that I would have to conform to, or they'd just decide something needed to change. Really irritating when critical updates take a week or more to get approved. Fuck Apple.
Anywho... Gnome didn't really win the war. Mint has 4 different editions: Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, and KDE (I recommend Cinnamon). But I get that your invested in OSX. Cheers!
