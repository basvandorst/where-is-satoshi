So?  How would law enforcement even begin to identify and interview the thousands and thousands of people tx'ing on shapeshift?  And yes, you're absolutely right: it is clumsier.  However, mixers aren't as anonymous as the method I just described.  Why?  Because law enforcement could reconstruct inputs and outputs on seized or hacked mixers, potentially identifying you anyways.  This assumes, of course, law enforcement is already watching a particular wallet.  Mixers may break the chain of identity on dirty coins, but they do not help in obfuscating input and output amounts.
The method I have described completely breaks the chain of identity *and* obfuscates input/output amounts.

Truer words have never been spoken.  When you stop hearing about a problem, but it still exists - that's when it's *really* a problem.  The media has the attention span of a 2 year old and when the same issues keep coming up, they get bored of it and move on to something new.  The same is true of people in general; problem today is the media has turned into "people in general" with their reporting.  They don't report on issues that truly matter, just issues that generate ad revenue.

His retarded friends believed him because who could possibly know so much, right?  Then they convince him to out himself thinking he's Shatoshi or called him on his bullshit and told him to prove it.  So being the narcissistic prick he is, he attempts to.  Notice how he threw out the "the other interviews weren't this hard" comment?  A momentary slip in his frustration to prove a fabrication.  When it's clear the journalists don't believe him he immediately becomes defensive.

You don't *have* to go through an exchange.  There's shapeshift and xmr.to; if you use TOR and a logless VPN, you're covered.  If you move your XMR to an anonymous wallet created over TOR - then move your XMR to an exchange, you're covered.

@_date: 2016-08-23 18:31:07
With Monero, one tx from the exchange to a wallet that was anonymously created over TOR and then sent back to a different XMR wallet on the exchange... that should be sufficient.  But yes, the amounts should probably be spread over multiple XMR wallets on one or more exchanges in order to prevent the exchange of law enforcement from "putting it all together."  It's really not necessary since any forensic analysis of an XMR exchange wallet will only reveal XMR sent from multiple outputs, making it all but impossible to figure out who the money *actually* came from.

Oh really?  Please explain to me how law enforcement can determine WHO was using shapeshift when you're behind TOR and good logless VPN.  
The addresses matter not once the input is exchanged to XMR and then moved again to another XMR wallet.  Any records shared with law enforcement will only show some anonymous TOR IP address moved btc to XMR.  Once the XMR is moved again, chain is broken.
Please re-read my post.  I was very specific on how to eliminate connections to dirtyBTC.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:54:21
@_date: 2016-08-25 13:23:10
You're not listening to me.  You're moving it to shapeshift.io to exchange for MONERO.  Then moving the monero ONCE to another anonymous monero wallet, then back to shapeshift.io (with a different IP over TOR) for clean BTC output.
Got it?  If you're not understanding how this cleans the dirty BTC that you inputted into shapeshift, you have no clue what you're talking about and ought not to be correcting those who do.
I'll break it down one more time:
1. Load TAILS ---&gt; TOR --- logless VPN. 
2. Move dirtyBTC (from AlphaBay wallet) ---&gt; shapeshift.io. Exchange for XMR.
3. Move XMR ----&gt; anonymously created XMR wallet
4. Disconnect and reconnect TOR for new IP (not necessary, but for paranoia's sake)
5. Move XMR from wallet back to shapeshift (or any other exchange) and exchange for btc
6. Move CLEAN btc to your personal wallet, if desired.
Advice: at step 5, transact random amounts of XMR to btc to multiple btc wallets.  That way *if* the exchange is subpoenaed, LE cannot reconstruct the chain based on the original inputting amount in step 2.  The outputs would be too randomized for LE to figure it all out.
Please, if you reply to this with some fallacy in my scheme, be *specific* about how law enforcement can trace the outputting btc to the inputting dirty btc.  Otherwise, I will not reply to any more of your posts.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:48:42
Also, since we're on the topic of privacy, that neat printer he used to print the postage has [microscopic coding]( in whatever it prints that secretly hides data like serial numbers, timestamps, and even IP addresses.
It's an "anti-counterfeiting" measure.  Of course, it can be used for other things - like identifying you in an allegedly anonymous postage transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:10:59
it could take a large byte out of botnets...
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:28:45
And he's not lying.  But if you use TOR over a VPN, you have nothing to worry about.  Any exchange of btc to XMR will be obfuscated once the change to XMR happens.  Going the other way (XMR to btc), you will be sufficiently obfuscated if you move the Monero just *once* to another XMR wallet *before* using shapeshift.  Once the XMR has moved between two wallets, it's not possible to link wallets and thus, the chain is broken.
Make sense?
Literally the only vulnerability with XMR are the exchanges and DNM's - because they have your wallet address.  Although the address is useless at identifying someone, it could be used to prove you *had* a wallet on a DNM if you were caught and LE somehow found your Monero wallet address.  So it's important that your XMR is moved at least once to an anonymous personal wallet on the Monero chain, then to an exchange service.

@_date: 2016-08-25 12:04:39
Again, so what?  The inputting Bitcoin address is already dirty under the lens of law enforcement.  The point is to CLEAN it using XMR.
On your second paragraph, I stated one would need to move the XMR again to another wallet to be fully covered.  Although, even this is redundant because without a view key, law enforcement cannot scan the blockchain nor can they see the wallet's incoming/outgoing tx's.
Do you fully understand how Monero works?  Because it seems like you don't.

Absolutely *not*.  The primary difference here is that btc mixers can still be tracked in the blockchain and potentially de-anonymized.  Blockchain analysis startups are trying to do *just* that and will likely be successful over time.
Because Monero's blockchain is opaque and cannot be "explored" in the same way bitcoin's can, it's more anonymous than using a mixer.  In order to view a wallet on Monero, the wallet's owner must share the private "view key" with someone.  Otherwise, one cannot just type in a known wallet address and see what's going on with it.

Thanks guys!  BTW, I love your shit.  Breadwallet user and fan here.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:45:47
Indeed you do.  That's why you simply move the XMR/Monero to a *different* wallet (or account) on the same exchange, then trade back for bitcoin and... you're done!  Or, if you're really paranoid - move the XMR to your personal Monero wallet (created over TOR), then move the XMR to a *different* exchange account, *then* trade for bitcoin.  Now you have clean bitcoin.  
Just gotta make sure you're using VPN &amp; TOR to manage these wallets, exchange accounts and transactions.
I cannot think of a better way to clean bitcoin than this method.  IMO, it's better than any tumbler, coinjoin, mixer....
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:46:22
Sure, but I would recommend you read up on Dash's masternode design after you read this for further understanding.  Dash relies on what are called "masternodes" to mix coins, sign transactions and protect the network.  It is feasible that someone could create enough masternodes by simply buying 1000 dash per node and then be able to, with some accuracy, trace coins.  Dash is a decentralized coin, but it relies on these nodes to keep the transactions anonymous - which is the whole point of Dash.  There are *some* defenses against these types of attacks - namely that anyone who buys 1000 coins can run a masternode; that's a lot of independent masternodes.  Also, the creation of many masternodes at once would not go unnoticed - indicating someone may be performing surveillance on coins.  But if someone (like a government with vast resources) slowly built up a collection of masternodes, it would likely go unnoticed.  Masternodes are also vulnerable to DDoS attacks.  Dash relies on monetarily rewarding all involved to keep the network safe.  The problem with this incentivized system is that it cannot defend against state level actors who do not care about spending large amounts of money, time or resources to behave maliciously.
Monero has none of these problems and is just as anonymous as Dash.  Monero's goal is to be a truly fungible, decentralized coin.  The only way you can have *true* fungibility is making every single transaction anonymous and untraceable by default.  And to have a truly decentralized currency, you cannot have a design like Dash in which certain nodes have control over things like signing tx's and mixing coins.

I can only speculate why eGifter has gone this route, but my feeling is it's DarkNet/cyber crime related.  eGifter is a popular way to launder Bitcoin in that world.  If you have potentially tained bitcoin or you're worried tumbling isn't working well enough, buying gift cards on eGifter makes sense.  It "breaks the loop" by keeping problematic bitcoin tx's out of AML/KYC banks.

Am I the only one who read the whole thing?  You do realize that any claims the federal government make have to be backed up by evidence?  They could be full of shit, but if they are - it'll come out in court and weaken their case.  So, while I'm not a fan of the FBI, I do give them the benefit on the doubt.
Yes, I'm perfectly aware of what happened to Ulbricht.

Or, possibly, BBVA invested in Coinbase because they see a future in it.  Is it really so hard to imagine that banks see and seize good investment opportunities?

When I was watching the demo video I was thinking "why the fuck would anyone pay to curate someone else's content?" and then I saw that if another person curates, the original curator gets paid too.
Ah ha!
But I feel like this will get abused somehow.

isn't blockchain a disruptive technology?  I understand the 1% fallacy, but I think when it comes to bitcoin and blockchain in general, there's an exception to the rule.

@_date: 2016-07-21 20:46:01
yes they did, but all the files were hosted on their servers.  mega probably brought in more than KAT, but mega's expenses were undoubtedly higher too.
I guess my point is this: torrent sites that use ads are perfectly capable of making millions a year.  KAT was probably the most popular after TPB went down... so it's not a reach to assume the owners/partners/operators are filthy rich.

@_date: 2016-07-20 14:37:08
Yes running in sandbox mode will help, but the firefox browser that comes with TOR is already in a sandbox mode - so it's redundant.  The most secure way to do this is to run [TAILS]( and then run a WHONIX virtual box inside tails, then connect TOR to a good VPN, then the VPN to the bitcoin exchange you're working from.  Also, tails has a bitcoin wallet - I would highly suggest using it to work with.
TOR is more anonymous than VPN's because TOR does not keep track of your traffic activity, logs, etc.  VPN's can always be subpoenaed and searched; the TOR network cannot (excepting malicious exit nodes).  So if you buy some btc thru a VPN, the ip address on the transaction will be recorded as your VPN.  If your VPN provider keeps logs, it won't be hard for law enforcement to work out who bought/received/sent the btc (at least, the IP address).  If you use TOR, it's generally untraceable (your IP address that is).  
NOTE: I am not suggesting any of these steps will obscure your blockchain trail, as many have already pointed out.  This will simply obscure your IP address.  If you want to hide your blockchain trail, you need to look into a btc tumbler, anonymizer, etc.  Here's a simple one: 
Using both of the methods together will make it all but impossible for LE to track you down.  If you don't have the knowhow or resources to do a TAILS &gt; WHONIX &gt; TOR &gt; VPN box, I suggest at least running a VPN and then TOR.  Why?  If a malicious exit node captures your traffic, it's still encrypted and obscured by your VPN.  If you're using a good VPN that's overseas and doesn't keep logs, law enforcement will not be able to figure out your IP address.

And here I thought it was the scammers who were dumb.  Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:02:56
If you have a VPN, I would use both at the same time.  You can connect to your VPN first, then open TOR and create an anonymous wallet somewhere.  That should suffice... hopefully your VPN doesn't keep logs.

So I'm guessing this season will shape up to be a battle between crypto currencies.  Bitcoin vs Ecoin
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:56:53
I'm not entirely convinced that's the way it'll go.  For sure, they'll try.  But it seems to me the largest bitcoin fortunes lie with people who believe in it.  Satoshi owns nearly a million, Winklevoss twins own 100,000+, plenty of AlphaBay, Silk Road, and Dream Market sellers, hackers, etc own large amounts.  I mean, the biggest owners of BC are the community, exchanges, and criminals.  LOL

@_date: 2016-07-19 15:29:08
I agree... one of your two scenarios are likely to come true.  However, I still think a 3rd scenario is possible: bitcoin fails in some unforeseen way.  Don't think it's likely, but it's certainly possible.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:46:41
Are you suggesting that people should move their BC around to different exchanges monthly?  Just curious.
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:15:41
Look dude, I'm just speaking about the possibilities.  Nowhere is it written there's a 1% chance BC will be worth $1 trillion one day.  I'm just saying if there *is* a chance and it's only 1%, that's a chance I'm willing to take.  I personally think it's better than 1% but whatever.
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:19:31
Everyone knows about it, but not everyone's buying or using it - hell, only a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the world owns bitcoin.  The Revolution has just begun brother.
EDIT: to finish your sentence, I have a feeling that Monero might do well - especially on the darknet markets.  Now that we have forensic bitcoin tracing companies selling Bitcoin's soul to the FBI, a truly anonymous cryptocurrency is needed for the darknet.

Logically, this makes sense.  More and more economists are predicting not just a recession, but a prolonged depression in China.  Inflation is a very real threat to China's economy.  It would only make sense that China's rich and tech savvy start dumping their liquid assets into Bitcoin.

Not that I've seen.  Still, once the FBI starts using these bitcoin forensic tracing companies and going after sellers on the DNMs, I think Monero may catch on.  One interesting thing I observed last night: one of the markets now has a bitcoin tumbler built into the withdraw system... they're charge 4% for its use.  But even with tumblers, btc can be traced if you have a motivated enough company working for the FBI.

did you read the story?  their ad revenue was in the 10's of millions a year.  I don't doubt it either; Mega made millions year, too.  And arguably, mega had way more overhead since everything was hosted on Kim's servers.  Torrent sites just host the trackers and links.

No problem.  I mean, I did it for my own self interest but I'm happy to share my knowledge.
Agreed... I'm going to "triple dip" on bitcoin, Monero, and the winklevoss ETF.  If btc continues its historical rise, the ETF is a sure way to make even more (albeit in fiat).  I own a little ETH as well... kinda on the fence on whether I'll keep buying; will wait and see how people respond to ether classic and ETH.

You may want to do a little research into what HSI has law enforcement responsibility for.  (hint: intellectual property rights of US corporations)
Also, please consider the text of Hanlon's Razor, which states: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness".  To further expound upon that, consider Occam's Razor, which states: "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."
Also, when you're making tens of millions a year, why *wouldn't* you pay for .99c for a song?  Buying a song on iTunes is infinitely quicker and simpler than downloading an album off KAT and then manually syncing it to an iPhone.

I mean, he just as well could have been describing cash.  Granted, cash has a visible serial number (which no one really uses anyways), but it's virtually untraceable once stolen.  Furthermore, the identity of users of cash need not be verified in private transactions, unless the users agree to.  Bitcoin works in exactly the same way.  If both parties in a transaction choose to verify identities, they may do so.  Also, it is not *impossible* to trace bitcoin transactions, just extremely difficult.  Just as it is with cash.
