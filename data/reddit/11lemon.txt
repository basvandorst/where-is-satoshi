That's entirely possible!  I was trying my best to get more in at ATH like everyone else lol..... but it was alot harder to get fiat in at that point thank god :-D   And I got lucky and my gut was right on both "bottoms" since then when I went all in with what I had at the time.  Bit of luck def helps in this endeavor :-P
