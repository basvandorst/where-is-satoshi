If you didn't cash out you're fine

The idea of these small group of people controlling the dollar and fiat money, being too powerful scares me also.. we live in a world that's completely unfair and ran by mobs (Federal reserve) 
They get away with anything and I'm afraid of them when it comes to Bitcoin

I've never read anything so beautiful... More more 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:48:55
Is anyone scared as I am? 
I mean I don't have that much money invested in Bitcoin but this whole thing is creating a state of future uncertainty 
Can someone ease my mind? How do you guys feel about this sudden skyrocketing value?

I like this analogy and I so much want it to be true but that's the ideal world

I did notice the increase in percentage is very stable since this run started. The problem is, we have nothing to compare this to so we can call it a bubble or whatever.. 
Although, it does remind me of the gold prices when it went up to $850 then dramatically went down again and it stayed for few years before it went up again .. or I could be wrong cause again, there's nothing to compare it to

Posts like this make my ask why did I subscribe to this sub.

Why would the exchange rate be horrible? 
Syria before the crisis 1oz of gold was worth 50k Syrian pounds. 
Now 1oz of gold is worth 720k s.p. 
Which has about the same purchase power as before the crisis. 
1oz of gold has the same purchase power (value) over the years.. I don't see that changing so much. 
The dollar, however has a steady inflation rate (loss of value) , and with it follow all fiat currencies globally. 
Am I understanding this wrong? 
I mean, people who had exchanged their cash with gold and silver prior to crisis are much better off than those who had stacks of cash that became worthless during the crisis

The U.S dollar is backed by Debt.

I don't think I understand your comment. 
In order for something to be accepted as money it should : 
1) hold value over time
2) scarcity. not reproducible (or printable like the dollar) 
3) easily portable
4) easily divisible 
Bitcoin is all of those things, like you said as don't as there's energy. 
The only other thing I can think of is gold and silver

Gold is real money... But then in the time of crisis people want food and water not gold.. I see your point .. but gold would still buy you food and water in time of crisis. 
So will Bitcoin, I hope.
@_date: 2019-11-04 15:40:36


This is true, but there's always going to be that someone who would give you food for gold. Gold will buy a hell of a lot more food than cash would. 
Examples : Syria, Venezuela ... Etc

Bitcoin is more real money than any printed or digital government currency
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:04:37
U really had to do that? 
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:28:55
Hahaha people like you restore my faith in common sense. 
Thank you! You made my day 
It's also my birthday

I hope you don't sell when you reach the moon also. Bitcoin is to be used not to be held. Enough with the Hodl crap. Start using it as money and it will be money. Why are we holding it? How is that any different from a bank mentality? 
USE your Bitcoin. Support businesses accept bit coin, if you are a business then start accepting Bitcoin.. 
I don't understand this hold/Hodl nonsense
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:39:10
Wasn't that why it was used on silk road in the past ?
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:54:10
Problem is , I own Bitcoin and litecoin an I thought I own them for that reason.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:35:35
You should've told me that 7 years ago
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:04:50
Say for example the owner doesn't turn it into dollar, how could it be traced then?
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:44:51
How is he saying Bitcoin is traceable? I thought it wasn't
I don't know why am I being downvoted. 
Someone correct me please , isn't the whole point of crypot currency is that it's decentralized and untraceable?
