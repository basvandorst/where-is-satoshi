See? Collaboration works!

It was a mistake to suggest that Bitcoin elicits this reaction from me for that reason alone. It also has to do with my interest level in Bitcoin, and the apparent barrier of entry..

Man I feel you there. I feel like the amount I could invest in bitcoin right now wouldn't be enough to see sizable increases in value. It's like if I invest in TSLA, I can only afford 1 share so even if it spikes up 10%, I only "earn" an extra $34, where others are making millions.
edit: gah, guys I know this isn't logical

On top of that, I'm not super enthusiastic about Bitcoin. I think it's awesome, and I think it's really great that it's becoming so big, I just don't know if I'm ready to get involved.

Thank you :)

So are you actually going to remake it? I know how easy it is to _not_ work on a project that already feels done, even if it's a prototype.

R&amp;M reference?

That is a huge amount of money to be exchanging, and I see it so frequently. It's just strange, I guess.

I've been watching for awhile, and have seen multiple transactions worth $30,000 USD. What are people buying so frequently with BTC, worth so much?
EDIT: And another for $99,987.97 USD
EDIT: Another for $197,888.02 USD

Ahh, that makes sense now. Thank you.
