Buying Bitcoin as a Banker is actually a great way to diversify. (As opposed to getting your bank's shares as part of your salary, which is a wrong-way risk.)
(1) your bank does poorly, you get no premium or fired.
(2) your bank does poorly, your shares go down.
But if a Banker takes a hedge in Bitcoin, he can still do well even if his employer becomes obsolete.

Here's an interview with him from a few days ago (it's in Polish - right click -&gt; "Translate to English" on Chrome)
They bought the exchange with 600 bitcoin deficit as part of the payment (not a good idea). Niemiro gave his partner cash to fill up the gap. The other dude probably didn't immediately buy bitcoin with it (which means he essentially speculated with customers' money). Maybe because of it, maybe because of another problem/hack, they ended up operating with a bitcoin deficit for several years until they've lost liquidity completely.  \[This is speculation, not yet confirmed - investigation is ongoing\]

I think the headline is ok. You will be paying from your bitcoin wallet, without using a "cash app" or "gyft card". Bakkt can scale like none of these services. The only reason a company like Starbucks would go for it, is because it cuts costs. Handling credit card payments is crazy expensive, so if they manage to reduce it they will be more than happy. They may even pass some of these savings on you with a discount on bitcoin payments.

It's mitigated by a passphrase.
I wouldn't disqualify trezor that easily.  They have a great team working on the product and a large community invested in its safety. The fact that Trezor vulnerabilities are being discovered and immediately patched (or at least mitigated) makes me trust them more, not less. Coldcard is still a niche product and yet to be tested in the battle, though it has a good potential and I'll probably give it a shot if they have a nice deal on Cyber Monday. $110 for a Coldcard compared to $67 for a Trezor One is definitely too much.

Yeah lol... even though most of assets today are just digits, "physical" delivery is actually a term used in finance. To be precise, customers will be re-assigning ownership of some of their bitcoin on the distributed blockchain to bakkt's custody accounts, which will then pay dollars to Starbucks. Bakkt will then aggregate all bitcoin payments and sell them on their spot exchange to institutional investors. Considering the costs of handling credit card payments, they will save money. They may even pass some of that savings onto customers, by offering discounts on bitcoin payments to encourage adoption.

1 BTC = 14,911 PLN on BitBay (highest volume Polish exchange, internationally arbitraged).   
0.002466 BTC = 36.77 PLN   
6.77 / 30 = 22.6% fee

\- you postpone this transaction every 6 months (by extending the nLock period for another 6 months), and of course eventually you die.
\- because now there is nobody to postpone the transaction, your coins get transferred to Fidelity, which triggers an inheritance distribution process. They confirm that you're dead and then contact your family and friends to offer fiat or coins, whatever they chose.

100% this. If you can't afford a hardware wallet yet, just burn Tails on a DVD (or use USB) and run it on an offline machine. It comes with a pre-installed Electrum wallet. All you need to do is run Electrum once to generate a seed, write it down on a piece of paper, and export the Master Public Key (scan the QR code) to be able to use it in the watch only mode on an online machine. You can now deposit to any address extracted from the Master Public Key, you can generate transactions and sign them offline if needed. Keeping a small amount in hot wallet is completely fine, but the majority of your stack should be in a cold/offline storage.

Local currencies in Emerging Countries are often pegged to dollar at a certain rate - their central banks hodl dollars and issue local currency (like the Jordanian Dinar JOD 1.41 = USD 1.00). This is sustainable for smaller countries, but would kill a larger economy in the long term.

Which is the right thing to do from the business standpoint. Custodial bitcoin is a purely investment instrument, but better this than nothing. It makes more sense if a Mutual Fund invests 1% of assets in bitcoin, if the alternative is that their customers would never risk touching bitcoin on their own. Also, don't overlook the benefits for real bitcoin holders: higher demand - price goes up, and when mutual funds, pension funds, financial institutions have exposure to bitcoin, there is no way for the regulators to just BAN it. Then the trust goes up, more investments flow in and it will get easier to invest directly. Also don't worry about adoption - it will always be cheaper to buy the coins, because Fidelity charges a fee for the risks of handling it.

Yup, sounds like the right thing to do. The owner really went to great lengths to resolve the KYC/AML issue. Video conference with the guy, then meeting with the guy in person.   
All in all, I doubt he would put his own, and his company's reputation on the line, if the money freeze wasn't justified. Keep in mind this is number 1 exchange in Poland (38m country). Allowing money laundering can make the entire Bitcoin movement in Poland drown in unnecessary regulation.

Not taking down, but trying to fight it. FB and its partners are a huge internet lobby, who have enough money to push whatever they want through the senate. And it happens that the things they want (non-government currency, international transfers, less KYC scrutiny) is also what Bitcoin users want. The difference is Bitcoin doesn't have to ask or pay for it.

@_date: 2019-04-19 16:47:10
it's actually an invisible tax... it's ultimately govs decision whether or not they want to loosen monetary policy. and given the trust in dollar is greater than the knowledge of monetary supply in the general public, you are basically slaving away and will be happy about this until most people realize this money is actually paper, and the whole thing collapses, and you're in deep shit.
that is, of course, unless you're one of the first people aware, and protect yourself by keeping your money in a scarce asset, such as bitcoin.

Wow, this guy should go through Macroeconomics 101 first. Hayek talks about something completely different - currency wars among national fiat currencies - basically govs can affect the fiat supply to control exchange rates to some extent, subsequently making their economy more competitive... shitcoin prices are driven by market forces only - supply and demand - there is no single body to inflate the supply or shitcoin real goods&amp;services economy to support - it's pure speculation. The correlation with bitcoin price has a completely different background.

Joe Rogan is still stuck with his 5 bitcoins to this day, waiting for Andreas to show him how to cash it out. This is fucking hilarious. The day Joe Rogan gets it we're officially mainstream.

This is so strange that despite being fully predictable, the halving event doesn't seem to be getting perfectly priced in ahead of time. Maybe that's the effect of the media write-ups on the event, suddenly reminding everyone that Bitcoin is a scarce resource and raising the demand?

do you have any other crypto-related apps installed on your mobile device, like price monitoring apps, widgets?

Trezor One has such a cool retro vibe.

you should definitely wipe your phone - restore it to factory settings. only install apps from known, reputable sources going forward. remember that app is a hot wallet and you should never keep more coins there that you are prepared to lose. keep everything else on a hardware wallet or in a proper cold storage.

Intellectual Dark Web sounds badass and hints at censorship resistance. I think I know what Joe Rogan is going to talk about with Andreas Antonopoulos for 3 hours in front of the 5 milion audience.

did you store your seed on any electronic device or just on paper?

That's because Model T sucks! Trezor One is the shit. Oldschool little motherfucker.

Seed backup is what actually matters... you don't need a Ledger to retrieve your coins if shit goes down.

Electrum is such an old school approach to cold storage. Probably one of the most secure ones still. You can air gap an old laptop, run electrum which is now pre-installed on Tails, write down the seed, take a photo of the public master key and you're good to go. Your funds can sit there for years and you can enjoy the "watch only" mode on all these long evenings. The problem is with signing offline transactions, so I used to do it only once, then I would abandon the seed. The risk occurs when you sign the offline transaction using your air gapped laptop and then transfer it via a USB stick back to the online machine to broadcast. You're basically vulnerable to whatever hopped on that USB device at any point in time. I suppose a possible workaround would be to avoid the USB stick altogether, and to transfer the partially/fully signed transaction back and forth using QR codes only, but that seems like a lot of hustle.
The Coldcard addresses this in a way. You'd be still getting exposed to online environment via the SD card, but it's more secure to put the Coldcard's hardware guts at risk compared to the air-gapped linux running on a PC. Although, I'm not sure why the post claims that CC provides a higher level of privacy and security than Trezor. The exposure you get using either device seems comparable.
