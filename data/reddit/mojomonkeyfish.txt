Chase is the bank you use if the idea of friendship, puppies, trust, community, and values disgust you.  I want a bank that actively hates me.  I want a bank that wouldn't think twice about killing me, just to watch me die.  I cornered Chase bank in an elevator and they agreed to give me an account as long as I never talked to them again.
Chase sucking ass isn't a new, bitcoin-related phenomenon.  They are gigantic tools.

If there were, the anti-bot technology would be rendered pointless and you'd be seeing bot-influenced results.  To be honest, for every downvote you give out to a popular post, the harder you're making it bots to know if they're shadow banned... so you're actually increasing the overall integrity of the vote count.  When I get downvotes (and I get plenty) I feel good that people are doing their civic duty to reddit, and that I gave them an opportunity to dish out their downvotes.
edit: grammar mistakes deliberately not corrected, in order to curry more downvotes.

What about the vendors?  I keep hearing people bitch and moan about the speculators who may have "lost it all".  What about the vendors who accept bitcoin (you know, the people who actually provide real value to the bitcoin), who've just lost a portion of their sales.  Where does their faith in the currency stand?  That's what makes this whole subreddit, and most of the bitcoin community, a real joke.
Note that I didn't say "bitcoin" (although, I'm starting to believe it) or "cryptocurrency" is a joke.  It's definitely an interesting and novel way to move money around.  But, if the market constantly fluctuates like this, it's very difficult for people to actually use the currency.
It's nice that, as an investor, you can pop down to the pub and wait for it to blow over, but as the owner of the pub, why do I want to take your shitty bitcoins as trade?  That's the person we need to be soothing, and trying to reconcile with.  People who AREN'T investing in the currency.  Visa and Mastercard might charge fees, but at least they're not going to randomly take a dive on you, and wipe out real sales, not just your fun money.

I think you're backward here.  There are two ways to "short" something.  The easiest is to *want* the item your shorting.  If I want a lot of btc (because I think the price will go to the moon in the long term), and the price is falling, I can sell my btc at a high price and then buy *more* btc back at a lower price, so in the end I've got more btc while my net expenditures are zero (this doesn't account for fees, of course).  Once the price of btc goes up past the previous high point where you originally sold, you now have more coins, and hence more value than you'd have had if you'd just held your coins through the downturn.
Of course, that only works if the price doesn't go to zero (your scenario).  So, it makes absolutely no sense for someone who thinks that's the case.
The other option for shorting something is... options. :)  Options are an agreement a party makes to buy an asset at a certain price within a certain period.  You could agree to deliver 10 btc at $500 (the spot price) and then wait for a few days for it to drop to $400.  Now, you can fulfill your obligation for $4000 and keep the extra $1000.  The problem is that I'm not aware of anyone selling options on btc with the appropriate terms for shorting.  Nor would this be likely, because it's too risky a gamble for the party issuing the option at this time.
tldr; You can't *leverage* btc to short them, or I'm sure there are some who would.  The only people who could sensibly short btc are people who believe that it's dropping short-term but going up long term.

Wow, this is the best point I've read.  Proving ownership of bitcoins and having access to them are one in the same...
Well, then again, I'm not a bitcoin expert, but you *could*, I think, transfer the coins to an insurer and take them all back again in the same transaction, which would prove that you control the wallet.  Of course, unless this is anonymous insurance, they can now personally identify all your transactions ever.
It really comes down to FDIC style account insurance, rather than homeowners insurance.

The "truth" is that OP is an idiot for not selling when BTC was $1K, or $800, or $500.  Even if owning BTC were his objective, he could own MORE btc if he'd shorted.  "Hodling" something that has been losing value so predictably over such a protracted period is really dumb, even if you're doing it for ideological reasons.

No.  This is the same burden any other instrument has to bear.  If you didn't expect this, you're incredibly naive.  It's not an attempt to "destroy bitcoin", it's an attempt to tax capital gains.  If you didn't have this problem before, it's because you're not a 1%er, which I guess is excusable.  Welcome to money-world problems: when your capital gains value, that gain in value is taxed.
If bitcoin can't stand up to being treated like any other financial instrument, it's totally unfit for actual existence.

I see this being said a lot, but I've only seen numbers that are standard VC contributions, on the order of several million dollars.  That's certainly a lot of money for a single person, but, I mean, even *really* dumb ideas can get a few tens of millions thrown at them.  I don't think bitcoin is *really* dumb, but a little VC funding doesn't mean its future is guaranteed either.  I mean, look at Neo&amp;Bee, they made several million dollars disappear in a few months.  I don't think it's safe to assume that so much money is focused on bitcoin that it cannot become irrelevant.

I'd definitely say that calling someone an idiot is critical.  I also gave reasons *why* I thought he was an idiot.  If you're trying to say I *haven't* criticized OP, you're on shaky ground.
That said, you don't have to agree with me, or believe what I say is right.
Also:  I really think you need to reevaluate what "thinking long term" means.  If you think that "in the long term" bitcoin is sound, then taking advantage of falling prices by SHORTING (not just continuing to buy more, but selling, then buying more at a lower price) is the sound strategy.  Long term investing doesn't mean you ignore the goddamn market for 6 months.  Long term investing does not mean a magical, no-maintenance money tree.  If you invest like this, you'll be ruined as surely as the day trader pretending he is one-with-the-chart.

Or, self-driving cars are an amusing anachronism that people will laugh at in the future, like the idea of self-whipping horses.  There are plenty of things we imagine will be ubiquitous in the future that turn out to be useless because of another technology.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:38:29
Self driving cars are a huge industry with huge amounts of money?
Sure, companies are making prototypes now, but they've been demoing prototypes of self-driving cars since the early 90's.  And, self-driving cars have been a common prediction since at least the 50's.
Meanwhile, multi-copter drones are already doing backflips around self driving cars. For all you know, we could be moving around in automated heli-pods before self driving cars ever find a market.
Or, perhaps automated vehicles will take a form that is fundamentally unfamiliar to us as a "car".  I mean, the car's design is centered around a human driver operating it.  Without that need, why does the chassis need to be a "car" at all.  It could be something on 4 independently steerable/driven wheels, capable of moving in any direction and a cab without a discernible "front" or "back".
So, even if the prediction comes true, the idea that you have a "robot driving a car" still becomes laughable.
Early futurist predictions of robotics were that "everyone would own a robot and they could send it to work for them".  The prediction that robots would replace workers was true, but the idea that workers would still be part of that process is laughable.
I'm not saying you're wrong, or that I think it's impossible or unlikely or even a bad idea or silly to have self driving cars.  But, all predictions about even 20 or 30 years into the future have been hit or miss.  We are (by definition) incapable of incorporating technologies we *don't anticipate* into our vision of the future.

Yes, Keynes, like any other economist, or rational person for that matter, recognized that rampant, uncontrolled, and unconsidered inflation will destroy an economy.  And yet, accepting some inflation was still central to his philosophy.

What the hell even changed at all to precipitate it (to quote this sub "the protocol is the same, nothing's changed", which is a convenient mantra when the price falls, but is just as meaningful when it jumps).

The account is free, and the reader is free, and they totally intend for people to use them for personal transactions.  I guess "privacy" is a concern... but it's a face-to-face transaction with a friend, so I don't exactly know what expectations of privacy you would have.  Your friend is welcome to try and scam your card, I suppose, but Square is not anonymous, and you have all the standard card protections on your card's side as well.
Of course, use of Square is predicated on your having a bank account and your friend having a CC.  Bitcoin could have value to unbanked individuals.  It's probably more up against something like a prepaid Visa card, which is what a lot of these people use for online transactions.

So, if you bought at $200 (a serious hodler), and you think for sure the price is dropping for the next few days... why wouldn't you sell?  You can buy back MORE bitcoins in a few days, at the lower price.  You could, I suppose, be afraid that there's going to be a bubble or something in the next few days, but what conceivable reason would there be for the price to rapidly ascend?
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:09:03
Well, if you find a quarter on the ground, it's not recorded forever in a public ledger.  I'd say that the reporting requirements are not really that difficult at all for bitcoin, because you DO have a DIRECT record of all your transactions.  There's no reason you can't calculate exactly what you owe, and it would be advisable to do so (just like it would be advisable for any business to base their taxes on their actual financial records), because if you lie it can come back to bite you.
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:20:20
Yes, but that was a deliberate measure.  It wasn't an accident.  It was a calculated move because destroying the currency to eliminate debt made more sense than suffering for years.  It was the equivalent of a national bankruptcy.  As far as economic effects go, it was probably about the same as attempting to actually pay down the war debt legitimately.  People in Germany weren't clueless.  During that time they stopped using the mark and life went on as well as it can in a shitty postwar economy.  And, after accounts had been settled, a new currency was started that wasn't obviously meant to fake-pay war debts.
We make a big deal about hyperinflation, but it's such a weird thing to worry about.  If there's hyperinflation its because your economy is royally screwed.  Your money could stay at the same value, and you'd have hyper-less of it because there's hyper-no-wages and hyper-high-taxes, or you have hyper-inflation, which is the same thing but it's easier to manage in the long-term.
I mean, the Fed could hyper-deflate currency too, if they wanted to.  That would fuck us over just as bad, as liquidity would go to shit and nobody would want to spend anything and the economy would be destroyed.  On paper it would look great: all my money is going through the roof!  And, then, when you eventually go to cash out, like everyone else, you realize it's just worthless tokens like all other money, gold, bitcoins, etc.
The only true value is the actual things that people are producing.  The ECONOMY is the key.  Money is just a lubricant.  This whole myopic focus on it, and centering one's whole philosophy on it, is like being obsessed with 10w30 or 10w40 oil, and ignoring the actual car.

No.  That is not why inflation exists.  Period.  The rich are rich, and get richer, because they have a lot of money which can continuously compound value through investment.  If money itself were an investment (deflation), they'd still have more, and they'd still get richer than you just as fast as they already are.  If you think inflation is an evil plot to protect the rich, you're thinking magically.  Perhaps you mean the way that money is issued favors the rich?  Sure.
I fail to see how the poor get richer and the rich don't when there's deflation.  The rich gain every percentage point that the poor do, but their expenses as a percentage of their wealth are far lower, so they get to save far more of their deflation-money.
Deflation, by it's very nature, *more heavily* favors those who *already have the money*, and puts new players at a disadvantage.  Inflation forces those who have money to put it to use or lose it through attrition, which is exactly what money is meant to do.  It's a temporary, imaginary unit that represents some value that you're owed in an abstract manner.  You need to exchange it for *real* value (the thing you actually need, or something that is going to appreciate) as soon as possible.  If you obtain and spend your money quickly (you're poor) then inflation and deflation have no real impact (the argument used to support fiat-bitcoin-fiat transactions).  If you have excess money, you need to wisely manage that excess value by turning it into something that gains value.  If you like gold, buy gold.  If you think bitcoin is the future, buy bitcoins.  If you think Twitter is hot, buy that.  If you think bananas are the future, buy banana futures.  If you don't care or want to care, find somebody who does and let them invest your money.
Inflation isn't fun.  It's a tax.  It's the cost of having money that is managed such that it works predictably for 300 million people.
If you want to redistribute wealth, you'd be ill advised to do it with the money system itself.  Taxes, unfortunately, are the way that's done.  If you want the rich to have less, and he poor to have more, then you need to tax the rich more and the poor less.  Inflation and deflation are flat taxes, they're indiscriminate (except, of course, if you have zero money).
