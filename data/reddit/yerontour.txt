So you want to stay dependent on the current banking system for your mortgage?

I also tried to get a Xapo debit card, but don't want to give them my twitter and Facebook account. At the moment the only option to request one.

Thank you for your post, you get my first tip for 1000 bits @_date: 2014-08-03 19:02:22
Who knows what the cost are to use the ATM network. I guess there are monthly fees and transaction fees, more transactions result in lower fees? If you want to use the credit card network like Xapo does, can you then avoid foreign currency exchange costs?
How do the charges on the credit card network works and is it possible to build a cheaper version?

Maybe his foundation can buy 7.6 Billion in Bitcoin and give it to the poor.

I was thinking to start using this ...and every time I pay a merchant with this bitcoin debit card try to convince him/her to accept bitcoin directly. :-)
Saves money on both sides.

Haha, no. I have a preference of a mortgage in fiat currency with a lot of inflation.

Yesterday I walked past a WU office and was thinking that it would be fun to put some stickers and/or posters on the wall with your ad.

Hi, here a traveling Bitcoiner in Salento at the moment. I'm heading for Bogota in a few days for some Bitcoin business and after that heading to Cali. Let me know if you are in the neighborhood. 😊

Yesterday I set up this mechanism with a 'saving account' in my Multibit wallet in combination with my Android Bitcoin wallet for my 'Payment account'.
Maybe i miss something but what is the invention?

I agree with you, but I think we have to give them the benefit of the doubt. For me this is an opportunity to start using bitcoin on a daily base. Even in Amsterdam it is still hard to pay my groceries in bitcoin.

It should be done via a notary and a valuation report and the mortgage is backed by the apartment.

No, not a scam. It's a  Nepali friend of mine that I met a few years ago when I was walking to Mount Everest base camp. I should have given some more information with this post.

I have to find a model that gives people enough confidence in this project. Maybe it works better on a local basis. My mortgage cost are about 10% of my income.

Welcome to the world of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:58:42
It should be done in a legal way that is controlled by the Dutch government, with paperwork of a notary, a valuation report and the mortgage is backed by the apartment

I also bought some extra Bitcoin. I'm going on holiday to Morocco and I need some Bitcoin to pay my hotels via 
Don't want to use my mastercard.

Can you also add if the card has magnetic stripe or/and chip? I have Wagecan with stripe that I can only use in ATMs, all shop terminals have chip over here.

This is the best Bitcoin explanation I've seen so far for newbies 😊
