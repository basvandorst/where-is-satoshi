Ive been mining since 2011, so I like to keep up to date on the news and happenings of all things bitcoin. But I have to say.. This subreddit is the most infantile of everything Im subscribed to by a longshot. Its hard to believe how ridiculous it is. Its hard to tell if Im on reddit or 4chan. In fact one story I was reading yesterday had TWO threads about boxxy in it. I wonder what the average age is here.

this seems to be a very american thing for whatever reason. when i played with lego almost 40 years ago now, me and every one of my friends, their parents, EVERYONE said lego, not legos. and we didnt need to be taught that either, it just made sense.
im from canada btw.

maher is quite libertarian in his views. he is just ignorant about bitcoin. knows nothing about it. it may have even been a joke by his writers. its in the news right now and they try to make jokes up about whats in the news.

i actually signed up to btce for the very first time on the 11th of this month, sold ltc for btc, but then had to wait 3 days because its a new account to withdraw the btc. but sure enough in 3 days i withdrew it with no issues.

its a going out of business liquidation sale!
come one come all. enjoy the savings. and if you dont like todays prices, wait till tomorrow when they will be even lower!
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:29:58
this is a very good question. one that i ask myself over and over again because if i hadnt spend all my bitcoins over the years id have 150,000 dollars worth right now, instead of like 2,000. sure i have a few things i bought with them, but the value of these things is WAY WAY less.
at least i helped legitimize the currency i suppose. youre welcome :|
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:20:52
so not only will it take months to get, youll have to fill out mail in rebates for them too!

I never saw any. I guess THEY are getting downvoted, while all the actual clutter ISNT? 
@_date: 2012-12-03 03:23:17
which is only handy in the winter. and makes it worse in the summer which needs an air conditioner to offset it. which costs more. so basically no savings
@_date: 2012-06-07 22:18:16
a new high? im sorry but it was many many times that at one point.

You might want to fix the English on the site. Where it says "less then" on the left side for pricing, it should be less THAN

@_date: 2012-12-03 17:14:50
thats the key word, currently.
you save on heating in the winter and pay more for cooling in the summer.
@_date: 2012-04-11 16:40:21
because youll be able to trace it easier and thats a good thing for fascists.

20 to 13 back to 20 in minutes. thats just insane. 
and someone bought over 2000 @ 13 too..
@_date: 2011-07-11 14:30:38
maybe theyll lower it again because theres still almost no one using it. the volume is ridiculous right now.

"but just as rare works of art are expensive they are not used to buy alpaca socks"
uh. works of art are not a currency, either. horrible example. you cant chop up a piece of art into smaller parts to pay for things. with bitcoin you CAN. apples and oranges.

@_date: 2011-05-21 00:17:10
because it was highly overvalued?
why would it be worth so much more than it costs to generate them, especially when theres very few places to spend them yet? 
@_date: 2011-06-03 14:46:23
downvoted for begging at the end. absolutely pathetic.
"im new to bitcoin". new but apparently have all the answers and understand it enough to teach people? is this the new karma whoring? begging for btc?

@_date: 2011-05-21 15:02:40
not really. if you have a lot you want them to be worth a lot. the more people mining means the difficulty keeps going up. people cant make very many now due to the difficulty
@_date: 2011-06-18 16:51:20
BTCGuild is a one man operation and Eleuthria has worked his ass off to make it the best pool around. This is obviously a smear campaign.

right. people who bought the cheap shit got it faster.. is there going to be any compensation for this crap?
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:20:45
I used them over 2 weeks ago to buy something on ebay and its STILL not paid for. Emails to them are all but ignored. If someone from all4btc is reading, please get this thing paid for immediately or Im going to do an all out campaign all over reddit and other sites detailing this painful experience.
TLDR: They took over 600 dollars from me and I have nothing to show for it.

@_date: 2013-10-01 22:58:12
no kidding. available in canada here on friday.. picking it up in a store will be much much faster than waiting for the shipping from wherever the hell this is. if they even ship it.
and yes im planning on getting it.

yeah, i wasnt saying you were expensive compared to anywhere, i just had no idea they were so much
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:49:56
i have the worst timing in the world. it hit 50 dollars today on cavirtex, so im like, ok thats it, im gonna sell 5btc. i priced my sale at like 50 cents more than what currently selling at at that point (48 something).. and apparently it was all downhill after that. i walk away and when i come back... sheesh.. 
i did this because every damn time i do sell some bitcoins at or lower than the current price it always jumps up. so the one time i try to be patient it drops like a load of bricks.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:52:28
i also bought a 60gh miner in feb. got it a month or so ago, and bought it with bitcoins.
if i had just held onto those bitcoins they would be worth over 18 thousand dollars right now. needless to say. i have not made 18 thousand dollars mining with it, and never will.

@_date: 2013-08-29 02:30:13
and for people that arent following. this is july '12.. and they started taking orders in late june '12. in other words, theyve shipped only a few weeks worth of singles from over a year ago.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:15:57
meanwhile its almost 300 in canada
@_date: 2013-02-22 20:10:15
the site is now gone. i also made a purchase a few weeks ago and have seen nothing in the mail. i was going to email them but the site is now gone..
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:21:41
turns out the item has been in limbo because of duty charges from going from usa to canada. the shipping company must have let all4btc know about this at some point. i would hope? but that message was not forwarded to me. not only that ive been emailing all4btc over and over and they dont reply. so while they did pay the main fee (they didnt rip me off), they are incompetent as fuck and i will not use them in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:46:03
Yes I can.
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:11:33
and it appears the pre-orders started around june 22.. so theyve done LESS THAN 2 WEEKS WORTH of singles orders. pathetic.
how many years will it take at the current rate?
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:47:03
you mean my bfl single may actually pay for itself? :)

No it doesn't. A quarter of US consumers is many people. It's plural.

do they have better shipping prices to non usa countries yet?

yeah that turned me right off. also in ontario canada here. i was about to order an sd card.. yes a little sd card. and the cheapest shipping option was over 40 dollars!. yikes.
i then wanted to try bitcoinblaster.com, but i cant even check out, its been broken all week. so i dont even know what the shipping is like from them.

i wish i had used bitsumo. 
i ordered a 600+ dollar item with all4btc and it seemed to be going well. i got a tracking number from them A WEEK ago. but the tracking is stuck at "received info". 
ive contacted dhl and they said they have not received the item yet.
ive contacted ebay and they will not give me info since my userid doesnt match who bought it. (the product has said in stock the entire time)
ive sent off 2 emails to all4btc and they havent replied back to me yet. :|
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:04:08
ok is anyone suing them? isnt it illegal to take money and not give you anything for it?
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:12:18
TERRIBLE service. dont return emails. but are not a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:03:57
thats what i dont like. they could hold on to.. half of them or more, and we would be none the wiser. they could sell half of the batches they make and mine on the other half.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:05:50
not a very good analogy.
mining supplies do not do the work on their own. theres a LOT of very hard work done by those miners.
