That would be fantastic -- that's really all it would take to start getting some movement.  
100% agree re: browser support -- Chrome devs seem like they might be on board -- though their backing organization might drag it's feet, so FF might be the most likely 1st native adopter on that front (they sure could use the usage bump)
My thinking is that it should be completely seamless to the end-user, so anytime they visit a '.bit' domain, the browser automatically knows to poll the namecoin node network instead of the associated dns server.

Cool -- to be honest I was being snarky -- mostly because it's 5:53 AM and I've not yet slept :)  
I've not yet read the docs, but will give it a peek -- thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:03:26
I agree -- just throwing an initial idea out there to spark thought.
This incetivization component could become a very real issue for the network as more and more small time full nodes drop out and larger organizations continue to provide this.  
We're (my company) going to do it as long as we can, but we're small fries in the scheme of things, but if all the small fries disappear, the big guys could have unique attack/manipulation vectors.

Depending on where they're located really determines the next course of action -- sometimes reporting isn't your best course to actually achieve the ends of getting *your* BTC back.
Ouch re: the 15 BTC, so sorry man.
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:58:38
I'd supplement this by saying that decentralized applications also can better handle signaling via Namecoin, something that might become more needed as apps start to develop out on Ethereum.
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:57:44
Check out BitIodine -- 
With this algorithm (in conjunction with the kinds of data gov's have access to) you are able to make the connections necessary to successfully tie identity in the scenarios you mentioned.

No -- it's a pretty vanilla name as we've been conducting business in other areas for a few years, but recently shifted into working on a crypto product, but that product isn't anywhere near the gray areas.
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:25:02
Bitcoin nodes are configured in a mesh style network, meaning that each node that your node connects to tells your node about the other nodes it knows about, at which point your node tries to connect to those nodes and upon successful connection the cycle repeats.  
When you restart your node, you start that cycle over again.
There is a 'known' list of nodes, not unlike a bittorrent tracker, that generally your node will try to connect to first.
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:27:53
Only issue I see here re: decentralization is that all calls would still funnel through 'centralized' DNS servers, thus breaking at one level the idea of true decentralization.
Otherwise, I love this idea for two reasons:
1. To bring a simple entry point for more casual users to .bit domains + decentralization as a whole.
2. As a potential fall-back for decentralized applications that might rely on .bit domains.
So...how are we doing this?
@_date: 2014-05-26 07:49:09
But isn't it clear to everyone that we need tens of thousands of pages of regulation and multiple committees and sub-committees to make sure that Bitcoin can effectively fulfill it's roll in America of serving the political and banking interests that have historically shown themselves to benefit us all in the most altruistic way possible?

I haven't tried Dark wallet yet, but have been following it since it's announcement last year.  Mostly I'm waiting until they have a version released with actually anonymity in place (not yet there).

Probably, or double the transaction fee (still would be tiny).

The style draws heavily from Art Deco, which had a bit of that religousy feel surrounding 'the power of man'.

You guys aren't the first, but I do like that you're funneling transactions back through Indiegogo so they don't lose their cut.
Some prior examples of campaigns that accepted BTC:
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:32:53
A great place to start would be for every physical POS that accepts Bitcoin to be a full node.
As a Bitcoin merchant its advantageous to have access to close/trusted nodes to help prevent fraud -- so in that scenario it may naturally work itself out.
Update: I was simply proposing this solution as a kind of 'low hanging fruit' :)  Basically a valuable and tangible jump off point that could alleviate one component of a multi-part challenge.
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:01:52
'percentage of moon pie' -- lol'd
I agree + you can be fairly certain they are actively developing the necessary algos (or already have them) to track funds with a level of relevance through mixers...and if they can't yet, like you said, all transactions are tracked, so eventually they'll find out.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:54:35
When I ran an always on (beefy) laptop it cost me about $40 a month in power -- not a small amount for some.  Cost goes down a little when you put that on a VM in a datacenter, but it still takes real resources away from other things.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:53:07
Awesome, good to hear -- follow-up question -- are you doing any business activities related to digital currencies?  We are working on a project in the space and I wonder if that played into things.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:03:01
I would think it would still be viable *if* the entry transaction was marked -- i.e. buying via Coinbase or any other KYC compliant exchange.  Local Bitcoin or Mycelium market might be possibilities, but there is still the possibility that the seller is identifying for someone else.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:56:36
Let's hope it gets considered more seriously, or Bitcoin will have issues with maintaining adequate decentralization.  Our company is putting forth effort, but it would be nice to be incentivized going forward, especially seeing as how massive amounts of funds are moving, though not directly through us necessarily, but we service their movements.

I think everyone is missing the point here -- start a nonprofit.

There is quite a bit of cost (man hours + power + connectivity + location) in making that cheap drive serve the network w/ reasonable uptime + bandwidth.

I'm not running that configuration anymore, but I did for a time.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:12:30
Well, a good place to start is the 'receipt' addresses, and potentially aggregate as many of those as you can.  This will allow you to do some analysis of where those coins went.  I won't go into too much detail as it might defeat the effort, but that starting point is the best jumping off point.
The end game is identity with either prosecution or if that fails, non-violent 
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:27:22
With effort + social engineering you could find them...but unless you had a life changing amount, probably not worth it.
I've lost money in HYIPs in the past before I really understood the game.  My strategy above only worked because I knew those few key points mentioned and didn't step back in once I got my BTC out.
How much did you have in there?  Just curious.
Post a public key and I'll send over some BTC.

@_date: 2014-01-03 16:57:01
The value to the network from full nodes is attained when communication occurs, so incentivize around that.
Tie rewards to concurrent connections at high speed, verified by other nodes/peers via an easier mining method such as 'node mining' (my phrase) where nodes (and even peers) verify other nodes contributions -- keep this mining process super easy and don't have the same difficulty increase you have for blockchain mining because the goal here is to simply check connections + bandwidth at a very high rate w/ low overhead.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:50:55
eh -- after gleaning over it, there really isn't anything here that wasn't editorialized back last year in articles that discussed David Woo's assessments + valuation of Bitcoin (probably this is where those articles drew from).
I do tend to agree w/ BoA on this point: "...we believe the structure of the digital currency market is one
of “winner takes all” whereby as Bitcoin becomes more popular and is easy to
use, consumers will have much less incentive to experiment with an alternative
currency with similar features."
This is why I monitor, but really don't engage w/ alt-coins, as it really is all about Bitcoin...the rest are just that...the rest.
One interesting point of note though...feel like calling the economists who wrote this?  Their direct lines are there...
"Bottom­line: maximum market capitalization for Bitcoin’s as a medium of
exchange = $5bn (for B2C e­commerce) + 4.5bn (means for payments) =
Interestingly, our $9.5bn estimate is below the current actual market capitalization
of Bitcoin at $13bn. This suggests that the current market value of Bitcoin
assumes either that Bitcoin will account more than 10% of market share for e­
commerce, will have more than 10% market share of the money transfer industry
(Chart 7)., or will have significant value as a store of value.
Maximum market capitalization for Bitcoin = $15bn
Maximum fair value of Bitcoin = 1300 USD"
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:26:29
They won't :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:59:00
It can be either and as far as I know there isn't a way for you to directly know.
The only real distinction between a full node and a client is whether or not the appropriate port is open allowing for inbound connections.
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:56:26
I think the core lesson here is that Darkcoin, while in theory is awesome, in practice still has much to be done, which means quite a bit of the actual protocol is still up for grabs as to how exactly it will be implemented...the kind of mixed signals you mention is fairly standard for distributed teams that are actually talking about functionality at an early stage (most teams are tight lipped exactly because of mixed signals/misappropriate expectations) and which are focused on different components are varying stages of completion + discussion, thus making it a HIGHLY speculative investment and a coin to watch in my opinion.
Good on the folk @ Darkcoin though, they have some serious startup capital now to take their time and build it right.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:06:54
True, but as the value goes up we're going to have to move the fee down to maintain parity (and continue to enable micropayments).  Eventually move the fee to 1 µBTC, then eventually even 10 Satoshi, or even 1 Satoshi as the value of BTC increases.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:08:15
Most definitely!  Love this analysis -- I squarely fit in the second bullet, but definitely see the value in a merchant running their own node, but at the same time that's a tall order unless it's somehow integrated into their POS.
I do like the robustness reward model -- you and or anyone interested enough to maybe start a thread on bitcointalk to work on researching this further?
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:22:19

Ok mister NSA ;)
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:41:04
I don't necessarily see a need for a government to admit any fallacy in the operation or fundamentals of their fiat; rather, they could simply offer the new currency (ex: Bitcoin) as legal tender (California actually did this recently) in addition to their existing fiat with the added caveat that you can only use 'approved/identity verified' coins at legal businesses -- and it would be fairly easy to enforce through an ongoing audit of the businesses activities via the blockchain.
Re: your point around fractional reserve -- it is a truly terrifying situation, especially in light of the potentially unstoppable cascade (like a scenario we saw in 2007).  I could see banks offering 'loancoin' or 'chasecoin', which is pegged to the price of Bitcoin (ala Bitcoin 2.0 sidechains), which could then allow them to continue their fractional reserve practices albeit much more transparently that that is what they are doing.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:57:56
There is discussion around compressing very old 'stable' transaction blocks, but not sure how much that will really help.

so much this!
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:04:18
Gotcha -- I've had no problems on the personal side of things either + BoA has actually been fairly favorable to the idea of personal use of digital currencies, but I've not heard any word about their blessing of business activity w/ digital currencies.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:53:42
For the most part I agree, but less than 100 years ago the USD was fully backed by Gold and not just trust.

It was unfortunately a HYIP.
Though it was fairly obvious, I also did a comparison of the spreads existing daily between the exchanges they stated that they traded against and the results they listed daily -- completely out of whack.
In spite of that analysis and now knowing for sure that they were a HYIP, I also learned that they'd just introduced their service -- generally those sites have a 1-2 month run time where /out/ transactions are possible -- so I dropped a few BTC in there knowing I'd need to pull fairly soon.
I realized a 20% gain on the BTC itself (excluding any BTC/USD price moments) in one week and nope'd the f out.
Unfortunately...someone after me paid for that 20% gain, such is life with HYIPs.
Also -- the actual site (dead now) was btc-arbs.com, not btc-arb.com
*Edited for clarity and additions.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:47:21
It's still in a bit of a grey area -- EFF is pushing hard in both education and litigation to set precedent, but as far as I know it's not yet 'settled' and will most likely stay as such because ambiguity affords broad interpretation, which ultimately gives powerful latitude to law enforcement...basically the same tactic that is being employed at the international level with the term 'terrorist' -- what does it mean exactly?  No one knows exactly...but there are some pretty powerful laws passed in the US that allows for anyone classified as a 'terrorist' to have some pretty nasty stuff done against them without due process.
This is partially why it's still a quite risky prospect to run an exit node for tor out of your house (as well as for other reasons).
@_date: 2014-05-19 04:00:56
The intention wasn't to mislead -- honestly was trying to tersely communicate the gist of the article and propose a question for others' thoughts around a potential opportunity for one vein of cryptocurrency.  
Thank you for yours :)  I tend to agree with your point (though I think it's a progression that lends itself more towards a global governance (ex: UN) rather than a local governance), though I do think there is a potentiality to inject namecoin into the discussion as a better way to handle dns.
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:31:19
I completely agree re: it being a good launch off point.
Yeah -- unfortunately most of those sites either didn't have good projects to back, or no one trusted them enough to back through them.  
Maybe something like a community supported stateless organization funded through a blockchain shares distribution?
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:12:30
Completely agree -- it's going to be fairly challenging (impossible) for the average used to comply, especially if they're spending out of multiple wallets/currencies -- it will certainly drive a new niche for accountants and potentially an increased or new regulatory body to audit and monitor for compliance (thegriptightens)

When people come over they ask why I have this nice little heater sitting on our end table looking like a mini monolith from 2001 a space odyssey.

Ok, once I can confirm that things are actually live in iTunes, I'll follow-up again -- apologies on the false start!  :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:22:48
Ok, makes sense on the ACH aspect.  
To your last question: the reason I ask is because if an identity is verified via Coinbase, then watching the entry point of those bitcoins (the address you give them to send the BTC you purchased), then they can effectively track the transactions w/ verified identity w/ a good certainty to at least one degree of transactional history inside the blockchain -- possibly more if other entry points are verified and receipt addresses are publically tied to other entities.
All that to say, if the entry point has verified identity, it's trivial to monitor the personal financial activities of an individual.
