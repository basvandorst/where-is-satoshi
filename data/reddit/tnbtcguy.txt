Personally if this turned out to be true, I would feel better, than the possibility the steadily growing "unknown" pool is some evil entity we have no control over... 
Because I don't believe for a second ghash.IO would try to double spend and kill bitcoin.
Also, I point my external miner at ghash.IO and back in January I was getting block rewards constantly. Then when community expressed concern and the % went back down, the frequency of block rewards went down, and is still down, from where it was... So I don't think it is ghash.IO.

Ok I posted in the other thread.. Interesting because my balance is different.

I really want to trust this... But I can't believe that it is smart to type in my username and password..? That is crazy! At least with an api, it is true I give you the key AND secret... But I have already set it up not to have withdraw permissions before I give it to you... How can this possibly be better?
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:59:15
And, that's concerning isn't it?
Seriously, I am asking...
I have been watching this occasionally and wondering, what exactly
 "un known" means..
Is it possible that some unknown, evil entity is trying to fork bitcoin?
Like a cryptocurrancy version of a hostile take over?

I also have been wondering about this.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:50:44
Not exactly, but it was when the price got back down to around 125-100 the second time...
At one point it started going back up, and went to like 275? From like 90 or 75 or something... Remember?
Then it started going down again and I sold, then bought back.
I think no more then 24-48 hours before it went dark.

Personally I am currently leaning toward hoping they all choose option C. Trade like mad!
(like I will if I get 25%back of what I lost)
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:12:33
Under those updated terms I qualify!

*bitcoin is a low friction(cheap to use) decentralized(no one entity controls it), open source(iner workings are not secret), digital, world currency.
*bitcoins are stored on (and never leave) a "trust less"  open ledger, known as the block chain. That is maintained and verified by the network with mathematical encryption.
*bitcoins are initially "mined" during the transaction/verification/maintenance process know as hashing. Resulting in a set, finite amount. Transaction fees will pay for continued hashing after all bitcoin have been mined.
*the public ledger (block chain) can house any form of data. Any form of data you would want to be housed on a network not controlled by anyone, and that is guaranteed accurate.
From proof of ownership, financial history, votes, autonomous contacts, to whole operating systems.
*poorly named "wallets" actually contain pairs of "keys" to an address(public key) on the blockchain and the bitcoins inside. An additional key, (private key) is required to unlock them.
*The same "block chain" design can be used to make other digital coins, for nearly any use. Including privacy, speed, data amount, and can be traded for bitcoin.

Now, 
my advice, put 90% of what you bought in real, legit, honest to god cold storage.. 
And plan on the the other 10% being lost, or stolen. Haha 
It will hurt less if you take this approach.
After you have lost a bit,(or used it a few months without losing) you will have a better idea of all the vulnerabilities, and how to properly protect yourself.
This whole bitcoin thing is a new global experiment... Treat it as such.

OP is forum speak for "original poster"

I have started doing this. With friends at work, and family. But I have been using mycelium app on there phones. It is easy and fast to set up, and all funds stay on the blockchain. 
One success story...
A old guy at work was VERY skeptical and kinda anti bitcoin... after I installed the app and gave him 1.50, he has been watching the price every day, and talking about buying some if the price goes down to his target buy! I really could not believe it worked! Lol
Also some small businesses that I frequent, I have done the same thing, and tried to educate them about using coinbase and how you don't have to hold any coins..so volatility is not a prob... we will see if that works at any of them.
Good idea OP!

I am very sorry to hear about your loss. You most likely will have to accept this as an expensive lesson. (Or this isn't true and you are baiting us all)
If this is real, it might make you feel a little better to know this has happened to me also... 3 times! Including GOXX..
And I have to admit, it was all my fault!.. I invested 3k in btc/mining hardware....and never invested a single penny in my home computer security.. Did you?
I am guessing that you must have got in early if you had 12 btc on btc-e... because no one would spend 12k on an investment and put it all  at risk on an exchange after goxx. So how much are you actually out of pocket? I know it hurts to start over.. But luckily it is still early in btc life and you can get it back.
This is the currency of the FUTURE.. if you want to play with it in the PRESENT, you will need to be extra, extra cautious..
Also, I have a request to the community... Can someone with some pull please ask each exchange to add a feature, 
VOLUNTEARY WITHDRAWL LIMITS!!!
Any exchange could easily add a feature to account security to make it impossible to withdrawal more then X amount per Y time... Only set up/changed by conferming from 2 diff emails...this could help a lot of noobs.. Anyway,
 sorry, 
keep your head up.

OK I found it. Thanks
Can you point me to the proof you found today that confirms the identity of the unknown mining power to be ghash.IO?
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:20:48
I have been meaning to post something myself.  Not a song I wrote, but a song from a band that always makes me feel better about life/risk/reward/failing/trying again/doing better next time.....
And the lyrics are surprisingly poinient to the bitcoin experience/experiment, and of course the GOXX fiasco. We all have our ways of coping with our accounts being empty..(3rd time for me), either suddenly, or, oh so predictably... Here's one of my favorites.
SOooooooo... Check out 
"My Money is On the Long Shot" 
By the best band EVER!

This was more to the point of my question..
Do solo miners show up as "unknown"
If so, then I'd ask makes sense.. More people like yourself have finally received there larger next gen miners and are taking advantage.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:16:50
I agree! When I figure thus reddit thing out.. I will help. :)

Yes, my concern is that you're code could store my username AND password.
I have read your description on Google play. And I have read on coinbase site about the new OAuth2.0 two legged and three legged.. And that the old simple api is depriciated...Still trying to understand it all though.
Is this app an example of "2 legged" or 3?
Also how can I be sure that the sign in  page really is "JUST a web view of coinbase sign in"? Is your code on github? 
I understand how this new auth system could be better once it is set up... With the tokens and all that.. but it seems that in exchange I have to trust the "web view"....
Coinbase should emplement what my bank has. If you are at the real coinbase site (web view) and you enter your username, it presents a preconfigured picture or something that I set up once, so I know it is the real, active, https secured site, and then enter my PW.
Anyway, I am not trying to discourage you.. I bought the app...might never use it... But I bought it, because I want to encourage development.
And.. If this is legit, secure, and safe.. Then I thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:47:36
No I didn't. When? On purpose? For what reason?
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:18:18
Wtf..it seems to be actually working from the android app..
Except it is a new balance...  not the balance I had at the moment of closing...ie after I bought goxcoin on bitcoinbuilder and it was transfered into my gox account making my balance 1.08 btc ..   
I was trading mostly with the bfx app, and it showed that 1.08 balance even after gox disappeared, until the next time I restarted my phone, then the balance was 0...
ok, now 
The day gox went blank,  After gox closed I opened the official gox app.. Like everyone hoping it wasn't really gone... this app had not syned to gox server since the last time I used it a few days earlier(before bitcoinbuilder purchase) and so it showed a balance of .268 or something like that..(in fact the ticker price in this app is still reading $768). :) 
NOW...the official gox app is showing a balance of .18btc and $18....
What is going on? I think they are rolling back trading..  I made one last trade at around $200 selling a small amount, then bought back at 125 I think..  I think it is set at that amount..

No I didn't, I didn't trust it either, but I was curious so I tried with the android app that was already set up with with api..
