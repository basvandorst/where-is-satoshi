Given a large enough sample size (which 2000 for the us population is sufficient) you can get a fair representation of US trends with a survey like this. That is of course assuming it's not a biased sample --which any reputable survey business will do-- and that the results are normally distributed (the datafollow a bell curve distribution of results).
If you don't believe me or are interested in why, take a basic college level statistics course. I liked statistics and would highly recommend it.

you can save words next time by just calling me a liberal snowflake.  I don't know why you're putting in so much effort to your trolling.  Or me for that matter.

A broken clock is right twice a day.
You still are talking out of your ass based on your emotionally driven  opinion from when you mistimed the market and lost money.
You're not making any predictions or giving advice, you're just validating your beliefs people will lose money like you did.
So don't expect much of an apology from anyone.

You're not completely wrong, but do you really need to rehash what Jerome Powell and Steve menuchin have been saying all week like we're special needs children? We know dude, we don't need you to tell us like you're enlightening us with something we are oblivious to.
P.s. dispensaries in Seattle are using litecoin to facilitate card payments. I can go to whole foods and Starbucks and pay for it with Bitcoin. While it might not fit your definition of "viable" currency, there are numerous startups and companies making payment technology with Bitcoin who are making it so crypto currencies can facilitate trade.

I don't see your point. Only around 18 to 20k of bit coin volume is traded in a day, representing .0006% of the total Bitcoin market. So I don't see why the ratio of owners to Bitcoin market is relevant since they are only trading a pittance of their Bitcoin if they are. Of those that are actively trading for speculation would absolutely be watching the news and placing their value on Bitcoin based on large market effecting news like this.  The rich aren't spending all their time plotting how to screw over the retail investor and it does you no service to believe that is indeed the case.

I'm failing to see how your link supports the conclusion that 11% ownership rate is a saturation point.  The article even states that between that survey and one taken 6 months earlier, awareness and willingness to buy Bitcoin has been increasing over time.
Here's another article regarding surveys that shows more increasing willingness to enter the crypto market from investors.

It looks as if the market is reacting to the news that India is looking to ban cryptocurrency.  An Exodus of a large economy and population center will cause a massive drop in demand and is why sellers are looking to cash out now.

Remember that as Bitcoin gains more market cap and market traction, the more sophisticated efforts will be taken by criminal enterprises to steal it. Coinbase fortunately avoided that attack, but it won't be long before someone eventually hacks them. 
Bitcoins main appeal is decentralization, use the same concept with your Bitcoin security and avoid holding your assets in a large digital pool such as an exchange.

A scam for a coinbase btc giveaway came up on my Google news feed. I'm sure this is obvious to mostly everyone, but be wary of anything that promises 10x returns by sending an amount of Bitcoin to a wallet. The scam is the same but their SEO and marketing is getting more sophisticated.

I'll upvote this because at least your argument is getting slightly more academic and less like the equivilant of an anti vaxxer using irrelevant data points to argue their hypothesis.

Pro tip. If you're gonna try to buy on dips set a hard limit on the price you're comfortable at with an amount you're comfortable throwing in at once.  At a point there's a price where the expected value of maxing the arbitrage is lower than the loss in purchasing the price when it returns to the mean. That's my suggested way to set a price to buy at.

What's happening is similar to what happened in December 2018. Since the short term yield is higher than the long term interest rate, short term interest rates are increasing (I think the libor went up to 8%, but don't quote me on this). This is causing a short term borrowing crunch when companies are borrowing to pay down corporate taxes and pensions are needing to borrow money.  To prevent a huge crunch from tanking the markets, the fed is temporary injecting more cash to drop the short term interest rates.  This also coincides with the fomc deciding to lower the rate and will reinforce a rate cut, as we saw happen today.
In the short term, my opinion is this will cause stock prices to rise while the price of Bitcoin will stagnate or slightly drop, as Bitcoin will not be needed as a hedge against volatile assets.

The other side of the coin is that if the US bans it and pushes it underground, the infrastructure is ripe for illegal organizations, organized crime, and/or those tax hating libertarians to utilize it for an autonomous economy the US has relinquished control of.  
I'm sure your harvest moon farm model of timmy not being able to buy an apple because he's afraid a stormtrooper would thump his skull makes sense for why price would go down and no one would use it. But I have a different idea of what banning it would look like.    
The technology of it makes it perfect currency for black market use.  Since its borderless and just as mobile with a country that has lax cryptocurrnecy laws as your phone is to the internet, then people can use an app to cash it in for their favorite currency on some shady website.  It'd be too profitable of a currency transfer business that someone or some organization would do it (and lets face it, illegal or legal it will be the big banks that will profit off it the most. Cartel or sanctioned money never stopped them from accepting it). This would make it a perfect tax free haven for the competent enough to use the loopholes to not have to pay taxes on swapping cash in the US.  I don't think there's any military big enough that could raid the entire internet to stop it.  
And now instead of speculators dictating the price of crypto, you have the black market economy propelling its prices.  the billions of sinful good that travel through illegal markets would suffice to make the price nice.  A bitcoin could be worth a lb of coke, or 46 high class backpage dates.  Maybe 100 mediocre dates. You get the ideas.     
Essentially its putting cryptocurrencies in a place where the federales won't be able to generate any revenue off of it via tax;  That means no money for the military or crypto enforcement units.  Its put into a space where government can't KYC it, to better track users and better regulate illegal payments it doesn't like (goodbye 100 hookers.  I don't want coinbase  or the IRS to know I'm a slut).  Nor can uncle sam allow the financial markets to generate profits with it which makes its political donors happy. All negative externalities.
Sure it could be banned so that jonny everybody decides to just use their credit cards instead, but you can't keep good ideas banned.  Banned good ideas just create negative externalities that would not benefit the country as a whole and at this point would be too costly to implement.  If congress is even half as competent as us (I know, that's a big if), they would be able to see that banning cryptocurrencies doesn't make economical sense.
TL:DR: Don't buy hookers, kiddies. Buy Bitcoin.  Then use the bitcoin to by hookers when the goverment shuts it down.

Normal boring people probably won't adopt it, but anyone savy will realize that they now have a medium of exchange that is tax free and not subject to burdensome legal regulations.
I think that will attract more people than you may think.
