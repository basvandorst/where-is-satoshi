Don't do it, just buy btc for the same amount of money you want to spend on cloud mining. Guaranteed more coins that way!

Antpool is trying to slow bitcoin down so they can have a stronger narrative to why people should move to their private bcash chain.

What's the biggest difference between the Federal Reserve and the Dragon's Den? 
The Fed publishes its meeting notes every month.

The files maybe hidden. Tell Windows to show hidden files. 
Or, start-&gt;programs-&gt;run-&gt;AppData

I agree, but I never felt the need to move. Been using Mycelium since 2013...
I'll be on one of the three Android wallets mentioned above by the end of the week if we don't see Mycelium signaling.

Guy Corem is a paid Bitmain shill and, he's been trolling the Israeli Bitcoin FB group (over 5k people) with personal attacks and fake news regarding Bitcoin's development. He's actually been asked to stop a few times by the likes of but is finding it funny to make Nadav (bitrated) spending loads of time debunking his fake accusations. 
I don't want to waste too much time on his negative attitude, but please be aware (he sold his company to bitmain and claims to hold no Bitcoin).

Here's the reason for my 'paid by bitmain' comment:
Guy's VP of marketing becomes Bitmain's VP of marketing the same month they closed shop.

Strange how much I agree with your comment.
