That is correct. I am obviously not primarily using my miner to generate bitcoin. I am using it to generate heat. The fact that it generates bitcoin and helps pay the energy bill is just a bonus. 
The miner sits in storage during warmer weather and I bought it when the price was a lot lower just because I thought it would be fun and I would learn something.

It is an S4, so it basically has two modes which I use. I refer to them as 50% and 100%. In 50% mode it makes a profit, albeit a slim one. At 100% it kicks out a ton of heat, but is just under breaking even. So on days like today (25-30 degrees F outside), I run it at 100% and my garage stays at a nice 69 degrees F. During days when it is 40 degrees or more I will run it underclocked to keep things comfy. Hope this helps give some perspective.

It was 1.83 bitcoin I purchased earlier in the year for $1800. I had it on a Ledger hardware wallet and I was surprised how easily it was to get it off and sell it. I did a test withdrawal and then three more withdrawals as I don't send/receive enough transactions to have a ton of experience in this department. Definitely did not want to screw it up. I will be paying Uncle Sam a tax bill this next year....

I did the same thing (yesterday). Part of me hopes that I made the right choice. Part of me wants to see this thing go higher....

I picked up a used AntMiner S4 last year (when prices were low) for less than $50. I bought it for the sole reason of HEATING MY GARAGE. Best damn space heater I've ever had (minus the noise). People think I'm crazy but I'm warm and I don't have to pay to heat my garage/workshop. Win/Win.

A lot of times they start with a Pontiac Fiero and that is what is on the title. This particular project is in Poland so maybe there are different laws there. No matter what it is registered as, it is a well done project and deserves praise.

Honestly, it might take some time to understand it but it is not terribly difficult. People that try to understand and say they don't understand are probably just lazy.

Brown mist....
That's all I have to say about that.
