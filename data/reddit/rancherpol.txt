This is really good, thanks.

That's true but nonetheless it still happened. People make mistakes and if this hadn't been paid for with bitcoins it wouldn't have got out.

Because otherwise that person can see the address's entire transaction history. If I want to send my mate some money I owe him for the pizza last night, do I want to also send him a history of everything I've spent money on, to who, and how much? Of course not, it's supposed to be private.

If people like TotalBiscuit, a professional video game critic, and two professional starcraft 2 players (as in, they play this game for a living) can make this mistake, how is your average joe on the street going to fare?

Of course it was a mistake, it's seriously embarrassing for the entire scene. Two professional sportspeople enter a show match for a $9000 prize, for spectators viewing pleasure. One wins, one loses, the show finishes. And then it emerges that all along they were colluding and were going to split the winnings in any case. People aren't happy with that, quite rightly in my opinion. There might be a legitimate reason the money was sent, but the above seems by far the most likely.

It is a pain in the ass, imagine if every time you used your credit card, on the high street or on the internet, you had to remember to do those two clicks? It would quickly become a pain, wouldn't it?

If bitcoin is going to become popular, you can't expect average users to realize that or even understand what it means.

Yes, you would need to do that, and it's a pain in the ass.
