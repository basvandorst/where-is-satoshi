Price will not always go up. It will adapt to the market as it should. It's a medium of exchange, not an investment vehicle.

I think that was the point of the post, to speculate. Nobody knows anyways and most people don't care. It just goes up and down.

Brexit was looking like it was going to disrupt global markets but it seems unlikely now so people are relaxing.

Quietly buy an asset. Create some hype that drives the price up. Keep fanning the flames while it rises. Quietly unload and let the newcomers absorb the downside pressure. Then let it drop while the late investors get screwed. Then do it again. 
This is normally how it's done but if you need to beat the rush out of an asset then limited trading works too.

A lot of people have been turned off of bitcoin because this place seems so spammy. It's finally rising without you so why taint it?

Most of his wealth is in a digital ledger managed by banks by thousands of employees with no paper to back it up. Bitcoin is a self regulating and self managed digital ledger.

You're asking hundreds of people about something one person did.
Guess I'll tell you. It was Bob Johnson. He's had a bad day and isn't feeling to well. When he read the second comment expecting some form of feel good human interaction he broke. He really wanted a comical pun referencing something well known in this sub. All of his dreams and hopes crashed around him and as much as he didn't really want to do it, he clicked the down vote arrow. He still feels bad about it but has decided to move on.

There is risk on both sides. it is possible that coinbase protects his keys better than he does. Fire, loss, theft could destroy his keys even though he is in control of them. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 08:40:12
There is a lot of rhetoric here and honest opinions get drowned out. Bitcoin could easily lose all of it's value and should be invested in cautiously. I think bitcoin is awesome and if I had more money I would invest more but don't think it is a sure thing. A year ago no one dreamed that it would get this low again. 
What's wrong with 50%. Things explode your set. Things tank and your still doing all right.

Media learn what? they said some guy said he's satoshi. 
edit: nevermind, BBC sounds convinced though they mentioned the doubts. probably based mostly on Gavins blog.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:13:01


If he is Satoshi he's probably toying with the community on purpose. He's like the engineers in Prometheus.

Some people are waiting and looking for opportunities to sell coins without crashing the market. This softens the spikes a bit. If you went on a mad buying spree then you may find that the amount of sellers suddenly increases.
It is possible for the price to double but it would probably need some type of great news alongside the upward surge. The bandwagon effect would have people expecting it to keep going up so they hold and buy.
Market manipulation is best left to the pros as it is easy to get burned on.

Is this a Harvey Dent tactic?

I think bitcoin is cool but I don't like the attitude that has grown up around it. It's become a sleazy used car lot where people seem to just look for ways to get new adopters so the price goes up. It is very spammy.
I see It's potential but I am not blinding myself to potential problems along the way. You can't bring these up here because people say you are trolling or stupid or whatever. I think this attitude along with all the people who got burned by the hype has turned a lot of people sour. People in this sub are saying the same things that were said at 900. Any talk about future price is speculation but here it is counted as fact that it will explode. Want karma? Link to an article that says a bitcoin will be worth a million dollars soon. Doesn't even matter if it has any basis.
The ignorance here has bred a counter culture.

My guess would be miners who want to hold a certain amount in bitcoin and sell the rest to pay for mining costs. They have invested interest in keeping the price stable but also need to be able to sell at a certain rate.
Anyone who has large amount would be in the same situation. Imagine Satoshi wanted to sell his 1 million Bitcoins. It has a book value of 280 million dollars but if he tried to sell them then he would get far less than that because the market couldn't absorb that much. 
Many of the early adopters have been selling off their bitcoins to the new wave of adopters. That's why the price has been slowly dropping even though there was so much new interest in Bitcoin. Eventually things balance though an hopefully that is where we are.
When wallstreet wants to dump some stock they have to create some buzz around the stock so there is some demand to absorb the selling. If they have too much then they can't get rid of it without crashing the price. They've been dealing with the same issue and are very good at dealing with it. 
Hopefully though, those who wanted to sell have cashed in and we are leveling off. I don't have any addresses as this is just speculation. I also believe that this is why the winklevi are working on the etf. So higher volumes can be traded with less effect on the market price.

He quit talking to him after he went to the CIA. Gavin's a human. Humans are weird.

Prediction: he really is Satoshi but he's sick of everybody so he's going to screw with them as much as possible.

It'll bounce off of 300 but hopefully doesn't go back to 230. Eventually it should break through.

They got hacked which was pretty much inevitable. Like if your bank got robbed but had no insurance and wasn't a chain. Unless the government guarantees your money you are out of luck.   Bitcoin is good for people who understand the dangers and inherent problems of the system but if you want the system to protect you from loss then you should be dealing with fiat.
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:30:07
I lost some currency but I tried to keep most of it out. Honestly over the last few years the best way to get rich was to run an exchange and then bail. If I didn't have a conscience then I would probably be rich right now, or in prison.
