Instead of selling, instead consider this alternate scenario:
First, make sure to boot into a fresh install of Tails linux on an offline computer. Next step is to create a paper wallet and print it out.
Ok once this is done, plant the paper wallet into the ground and wait for 5 moons to pass. You will now have bitcorn. 
Ok, now that you have bitcorn, wait for the bubble to pop, and you will have bitpopcorn. mmmm, just grab some butter and enjoy.

Not sure about it being a pre planned theft. Although I can't find it now, I remember seeing a picture of a chat between DPR and one of his employees in which he stated that he was willing to provide liquidity for an underground decentralized exchange. I'm sure he had the coin to provide liquidity to every major exchange that is currently running.
