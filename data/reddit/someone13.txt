Well, I guess there's a two-part answer to this.  Firstly, I don't live in the USA, nor do I plan to host there, so the specific act you mention doesn't apply.
Secondly, as far as I know, Bitcoin isn't actually an officially-recognized currency.  I will, of course, look at the relevant local law if I decide to go ahead with this - I'm just checking to see what kind of interest there is before I go ahead and start working on this.  I have no desire to get in trouble with the police :P

Yeah, I've seen that before - that's actually what prompted me to see if I could design a better system.
And, yeah, I know there's not a lot of money to be made - I'm not doing this to make money.  I just find it interesting, and if even ten people will use it, I'll make it :P

I'd be interested in knowing that, and also what kind of throughput you see on Blind Bitcoin?

I can't speak for laws in your country (I don't know where you live, for one), but I can say that in the country that I live, the relevant act states that I need to track all money transfers over a certain currency value, or the equivalent amount in any other currency.  I think the easiest method of doing this would be to disallow transactions larger than this amount, so I don't have to keep logs at all.
