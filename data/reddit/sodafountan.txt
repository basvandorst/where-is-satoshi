On the contrary it can absolutely grow indefinitely if governments continue printing money and there continues to be a demand for bitcoin. bitcoin is limited, government fiat is unlimited. So until one bitcoin = one bitcoin, the price can grow indefinitely against the US dollar.

A. The Supply will not go down. Supply is leaked steadily into the system regardless of how many miners are active. 
B. Mining will only be less centralized if there are more miners in China than there are elsewhere, but that can very quickly flip, in which case countries like the US become the more centralized areas. 
C. Mining profitability will indeed go up, but because most exchanges are localized at the moment, the increase of supply to other countries (Like the US, and Korea) will likely mean that prices on exchanges based in other countries (like coinbase) will fall. (in theory)

You're 100% right. Just keep in mind that the stock market was once seen as VERY risky, no investor in their right mind would have recommended putting 10% in stocks in the 1950's for example. They'd recommend bond purchases, but who in their right mind would recommend bonds in today's day and age? You could very well see that happen to the stock market over the next 20+ years. 
With that being said, things are growing exponentially and it has to do with the global debt burden. Every time a country increases its debt ceiling, more money gets printed. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY. But when you "ISSUE" new debt (because you're congress and you can) you're creating money out of thin air. Period. Someone will be on the receiving end of that debt. Someone is owed that money. Whether it be contractors, state governments, local governments you name it. But that money finds its way back into the system at the end of the day. 
Crypto is a hedge against that.

yup, most of its just paper value though, nobody has any idea how big the derivatives market actually is. The truly scary part is when banks take the value of a derivative and provide loans backed by them. Mortgage backed securities anyone? That's one of the many derivatives that brought our financial system to its knees in 2008 and had a real effect on people's lives and it could easily happen again. The hedge against that is bitcoin.

It'll be too big to fail before you know it. It becomes too big to ban after 1,000,000. At that point, governments start to buy mass quantities of it out of fear and the price will soar.. probably to somewhere around 10,000,000 to 100,000,000 per bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto becomes the world's first trillionaire, people are wealthy, jobs start to become automated, yada yada yada
Bitcoin will never be used as a currency LOL. We already know that. Some other altcoin maybe will at some point but who cares, dollars work just fine as they are. Maybe the FED will issue some sort of DollarToken out of desperation in the year 2022-2025. But it'll be inflationary, maybe the next chairman will be able to issue it with the click of a button just like he can do now, everybody laughs and continues buying bitcoin. 
Look this is the next internet, like I said my grandmom didn't get on board until recently and she's doing just fine.

No, the wikipedia definition of a pyramid scheme states that the scheme has to be controlled by a single actor or entity, in this case that person would be Satoshi Nakamoto but we all know that strange story. 
CryptoCurrency does have value, it has value in its anonymity and utility as well as its deflationary aspects. 
Also if that's the case was gold a pyramid scheme that was propped up by the government before we disbanded from the gold standard? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:10:56
The problem is the US debt. If massive amounts of people buy cryptocurrency globally like I expect to happen over the next few years the price will skyrocket, in turn personal debts like auto loans and home loans will be repaid rapidly and flood back to the banks who in turn will look for sound investment and probably go bitcoin. The fed will realize that by the banks buying bitcoin they'll be killing their own business and probably put restraints on how much can be purchased, a lot like an interest rate. The problems come when the debt is getting paid back and China comes knocking asking for payment in bitcoin rather than US dollars. Then the US will be forced to purchase bitcoin with MASSIVE amounts of fiat and the price will be driven to crazy levels. I'm talking billions of dollars per bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:56:59
Bitcoin rewards investment just like any other investment. 
I look at bitcoin as a modern day global bond market on steroids. You "Loan" your money to the world by buying bitcoin which increases the value of everyone else's bitcoin, people reach their goals and sell their bitcoin for their local fiat, stimulate the economy in a big way and the cycle continues. 
I think bitcoin will cut a lot of much needed fat from our economy over the next ten years but that's a good thing, it won't be looked at as a recession, bitcoin will be looked at as the largest natural redistribution of wealth the world has ever seen and the last people to get in will be the billionaires who already have enough money and can live the lives that they choose. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:16:59

you realize the price of an asset isn't necessarily tied to a market cap right?

As the asset is looked at as more stable people will put far more than 1,000 dollars into bitcoin, look to number more around 20 to 50% of a salary. 
Don't forget to factor in that governments haven't even begun investing in Bitcoin yet. Do you think China, Russia, the United States and others won't eventually want a piece of bitcoin? 
The numbers will astound you in the coming years. 
If the world wide web is the earth's store of knowledge, then bitcoin is the earth's store of wealth. And just like the web every single human being will be able to tap into it. 
5 million is laughably cheap when you look at it like that.

Right, the mempool will grow in size but the block size remains the same. That's one of the core differences between Bitcoin and bcash. While bcash has bigger block sizes (and can thus include more transactions in each mined block) it's not the original bitcoin, it's just a fork.

You idiot, he's not getting double taxed if he does this, the only way he gets double taxed is if he gets payed a normal paycheck (TAXED) and then buys bitcoin cashes his gains out and then gets taxed again. If he receives a payment in Bitcoin he only gets taxed when he cashes out.

Keep also in mind that we're in the midst of one of the largest holidays in the United States and Europe, two of bitcoins biggest markets. People who hodled large quantities of coins are realizing their moons before the holiday while demand is down because the average man with spare money to invest in crypto is giving it to retail stores at the minute. Combine that with the fact that we're at hyper FUD levels in the media, it's really a miracle that the price is holding let alone slowly rising. Expect LARGE gains after the holidays. HODLERs will be rewarded again as it's been shown countless times throughout the history of this currency.

Governments will care very much if it becomes too big to ban, governments are made up of people and by the time the "government" decides to take steps either for or against bitcoin the technology will have already penetrated the servants of the government.

I think the biggest change that'll come over the next year is the realization that we've gone parabolic. Bitcoin will not crash ever. It is literally the earth's saving's fund. Bitcoin will make everyone rich and Fiat will not go anywhere. 1993 was the introduction of the Internet, it changed the world, by 1997 it had started to go mainstream and we never looked back. 2003 was the when consumer-grade phones started to make their way to the masses, by 2007 we had the Iphone, it changed the world. 2013 Mt. Gox Collapsed, 2017 Bitcoin has gone parabolic, it will change the world. 
Bitcoin will never crash, it will ALWAYS get more valuable as more money continues to be printed. We now have dueling currencies, one that is inflationary and serves its purpose, the other is deflationary and serves its purpose. Bitcoin will always gain in value and fiat will always decrease in value. 
Think about it, this technology could solve the world's incessant need for money. I don't think most people realize just how much the internet has impacted their lives over the past 20 years, or how much smartphones have. 
What if everyone was free to pursue their passions more? How would that impact the world? What if we didn't have to constantly worry about money? Maybe the world is about to change drastically as automation hits us full force over the next, ten, twenty, thirty years.

I agree with most of this, however I don't buy into the "Doom and Gloom" scenario. I think the older generation, the ones that destroyed our economy, will sit and hoard cash while Millenials and new generations will purchase bitcoin globally and sweep the wealth right out from under them. I think we will see a temporary correction as the stock market loses new investments to the much safer, more stable, more secure, and much more valuable bitcoin. New company's won't be funded off of some bullshit IOU if my company does well and we don't split the stock and here's your dividend and complex tax structure and SEC filing and yada yada yada.

Why do we need one cryptocurrency? Perhaps Bitcoin acts as a store of value while others offer easier ways to transfer money. Perhaps Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash live in tandem with each-other. I purchase Bitcoin when I want the value of my dollars to increase. I don't care about the high fee because I've already quadrupled my money. What's ten bucks when I'm up 10,000? And BCash is used when I want to transfer and exchange value with people.

I know what inflation is I'm saying that economies of scale are immune to it, save some catastrophic event like a war (see Germany, which even still didn't have a very advanced economy after WWI). It wasn't the influx of money that was the primary catalyst of hyper-inflation as people often think, it was that their economies of scale were destroyed which meant people could use that huge influx of money to bid up the prices of things they needed but didn't have easy access to.  Also see: Africa. 
The American economy is immune to hyper inflation because it works like a well oiled machine. The only thing that could cause it is a massive influx of money to the general population (Bitcoin will cause this) AND a broken economy of scale (Only thing that could cause this is war as far as I can tell)
People aren't going to use that influx of money to bid up the price of food unless they need to, but as of now our food needs are met as a nation. So they're far more likely to bid up the price of Luxury Goods and Real-Estate, which will absolutely happen.

I think you're very wrong, ultimately I think bitcoin will just blind people to the full brunt of automation as it makes its way into our everyday lives, picture this scenario: 
Truck Drivers: Pete's 50, Pete's a truck driver, he's been doing it all his life and all he's ever wanted was to own a ranch. He sees his only chance at attaining that goal at this point in life by putting a majority of his money into bitcoin. Meanwhile, this is happening globally. Pete ACTUALLY reaches his goal, it's one of the happiest moments of his life. He quites his job as a truck driver and buys his ranch and a new truck, Pete gets to retire at 55. 
Jim sees what happened to Pete and decides to do the same thing, meanwhile Pete gets bored and starts raising cattle, he sells the milk as a local organic and farm-raised solution to local supermarkets. He misses bitcoin and decides he wants to take an extravagant vacation at some point, so he continues buying bitcoin. 
Jim hits his goals, and eventually so does Pete again, they were rewarded for contributing to the global store of wealth. 
Mike owns the trucking company, he sees his drivers are leaving and aren't being replaced by... well anyone, Millenials don't want the job and Pete and Jim certainly ain't coming back. Mike's been reading the financial news and has been investing some of the company's profits in bitcoin - just in case - he doesn't want to quit his job, he likes being an entrepreneur but he now has enough to buy one of Tesla's new autonomous trucks (Without a bank loan! So there's very little risk!).

Don't be stupid. This was handled terribly. Coinbase could have EASILY shown an available balance and given an exact date that trading would begin.

Difficulty doesn't have anything to do with fees. Fees are associated with the number of transactions in the mempool. Higher numbers of transactions means fees need to be higher in order prioritize that transaction. 
But it's fine because Bitcoin isn't a currency anymore, it's a store of value. If you want a currency go buy Tether or Ripple or some alt that works better for actual transactions.

Fees don't matter because the only time you'll ever pay them is when you want to cash out back to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:07:32
Right Derivatives will most likely lose tremendous amounts of value as they're deemed relatively worthless (rightfully so) but derivatives are sold for real cash that is backed by the fed. Every ounce of debt in the United States is backed and approved by the fed but if people see the asset as less valuable than what the fed (the banks, which are backed by the fed) have on their books then that asset loses value but stays on the feds books. 
That's exactly what happened during the financial crisis. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:30:44
No because as people hold the asset it increases in value, it doesn't matter if I hold 1 whole bitcoin or fractions of it that percentage of bitcoin is taken off of the market. People will hold the asset because it will guarantee a return, it's a store of value that's accessible to anybody. It's honestly the greatest store of value ever devised. 
And I'll give you an example: Do you think if Bitcoin, in some hypothetical context, ever hit zero dollars people would just pack their shit up and say "Well boys that was fun, that's enough for me" and just leave? No, it would skyrocket back up as people bought in and tried to ride the next wave. It's actually impossible to hit zero dollars at this point, it's already proven it has value, humans have given it value and that is unequivocally true, and that value currently sits at around 16,000 dollars last time I checked. 
So you're basically arguing that it'll either trend up in the long term or down in the long-term. It either gains 10X and much MUCH more or it hits zero. What do you honestly believe it will do?

basically on gdax and many other exchange you can place an order that says "Sell X amount of bitcoin when the price reaches Y amount of dollars" So in this case someone (probably a large miner that's been mining coins for awhile, don't believe the "shady backroom wallstreet" type manipulating the markets, although it could be, we don't know) anyway someone put in a sell order of 2000+ BTC when the price hits 17250. that creates a lot of supply that has to be eaten up before we can move ahead to the next round of sell orders.. but what's so amazing is that that wall was obliterated, just goes to show how much demand there is for bitcoin

Bitcoin won't cause hyperinflation. Countries like Venezuela struggle because they don't have the infrastructure to support economies of scale and so when someone sees, let's say, ripe fruit or meat in a local market, the highest bidder wins. That doesn't happen in America or the rest of economically superior nations. If I go to a grocery store I'm gaurunteed quality and quantity, therefore I don't need to bid the price up on things that I want and so unless Americans start eating a whole lot more after the coming waves of bitcoin appreciation then I think we'll all be just fine. you WILL see inflation on Luxury Goods, Real-Estate, Tourist Destinations, Flights, and things of that nature. 
As for Venezuela I hope they kick the communist fucks that seized their country out of office and begin to privatize things, they need to become democratic capitalists if they have any hope of getting out of their mess. Crypto can and will help, but they'll need a lot more than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:32:22
No.. Immediately in my opinion. Just think, who are the biggest sellers? Most likely the miners who need to pay electricity costs and acquire computing power. Globally their supply will be cut in half at once in 2020. I think the price will double almost instantly if everything stays the same. It should be interesting.

Well, transactions are just made up of number of inputs and number of outputs. I'd assume they'd account for all addresses that have one or more inputs and no outputs for a period of maybe a year or more? 
That's how I'd calculate something like this.

And that's just the US debt, that doesn't account for the Global Debt, Stock Markets, Real Estate, Derivatives (estimated to be a quadrillion dollar market by some estimates, basically it's the act of creating money from thin air via contracts) etc. etc. Student Loan Debt is one that'll probably start to disappear the soonest as millienials become rich off of their assets and use it to pay back that debt. Essentially bitcoin has no ceiling for as long as governments are allowed to create money from nothing. 
Bitcoin will be the greatest redistribution of wealth the world has ever seen, we'll all go from debt slaves to owners again and it'll be breathtaking. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:17
And they may be able to do this for a while, but at some point, it will get too big to be able to do this consistently. Bitcoin is a global store of value, every man woman and child on the face of the earth can own it and benefit from it, one player from one exchange in the US won't be able to manipulate the price for long.

And that's fine, many people will multiply their net worths many times over in the coming years. But I'd always advise people to understand something before they invest in it, by saying bitcoin doesn't have value you don't yet understand what it actually is. Keep your eye on it, take some time to learn about how it works and then re-evaluate your decision in the coming months, years and decades.

No you wouldn't pay any taxes when the employer converts their money to bitcoin and then passes the bitcoin to you. There's nothing in the tax law that says you can't do that (YET) If I asked my employer to pay me in blades of grass how would the IRS tax that? If I then sold said blades of grass to another person I would THEN BE LIABLE to pay taxes. Do you understand?

Sure! No it's a good question. 
Keep in mind that governments, no matter how corrupt they are, are made up of people. If Bitcoin can benefit people on an individual basis it'll succeed. 
Take a look at the internet. It benefits and empowers the average human being. Then take a look at what happened during the Arab spring, people used the power of social media to organize and then overthrow entire governments, it wasn't without turmoil, but in the end most of those endeavors were successful.
Governments will also love the tax revenue it brings in as I FULLY believe that Bitcoin will live in tandem with Fiat for many MANY years to come in the same way that the internet has never, and probably will never, completely replace retail shopping locations. 
My vision of the future is that people will invest in Bitcoin, from the poorest family in Africa to the richest and most powerful people in America and benefit from everyone else's investments in the Asset very similar to how we benefit from the internet by communicating like the way we are right now.

Bubbles are healthy for bitcoin and part of the natural evolution of the algorithm. I don't want bubbles to ever go away and I don't think they will, bubbles are how long time supporters and believers in bitcoin profit. 
There will be a bubble after every halving, some people are trying to claim that the halving is already priced in but it's something you can't "price in", it's an organic event that will have a slow but steady impact on the price, and when people see the price begin to rise fomo becomes real and boom, the cycle continues.  
When I explain to people what bitcoin is I just tell them it's one of the most brilliant economic algorithms ever invented, it'll repeat over and over and over again. What a time to be alive.

Doesn't matter in the slightest, bitcoin is a store of value not a digital currency. Deflationary currencies aren't a good medium for exchange as they don't encourage spending and they never will. Fees don't matter in that case. Buy, Store, Hold, Sell when you can pay off your debt. That's bitcoin.

You know what should scare you even more? Apple just hit a trillion dollar market cap, and just in the news today Amazon hit the same. 
a 50 million dollar bitcoin would mean that wealth is distributed in the hands of the people and not consolidated into a few companies that own everything. 
Also, that's not reallllly how inflation works. I'm not going to sell a shit ton of bitcoin just so I can buy more hamburgers, hamburgers are like a commodity and aren't really affected by inflation in the same way real-estate or luxury cars would be in the inevitable event that bitcoin hits this price. Prices on new lambos will DEFINITELY go up. The price on groceries most likely won't be affected as I don't really plan on eating more after I become rich. 
Nothing to fear here my friend

Here's a question on StackExchange that asks the question of how long would it actually take to guess a private key: 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:09:39
I don't agree with this, while a lot of the 1% are complete crooks, many have legitimately changed the world and deserve to be among the wealthiest people in the world. A lot of those people will hedge their dollars against the rise of bitcoin by buying bitcoin, but in turn that will cause all of our bitcoin to rise as well which distributes their wealth away from corporations that don't even make a profit and back towards every human on earth. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:46
It might seem unrealistic, but so did being able to talk to anybody on the planet with a device in your pocket 50 years ago. 
I think Bitcoin will do to people's freedom what the world wide web did to people's ability to communicate. Someone will be able to work for around 5 years and steadily put money into the asset and then be able to sell those coins (if they choose) and travel the world, buy a home, raise a family etc. Only to go back to work and contribute to something new (paid in fiat, at least for the next decade) and continue to contribute back to the global store of wealth.
That's what Bitcoin is, a global store of wealth. If the Internet is a global store of knowledge, then bitcoin is a global store of wealth. 
My vision for bitcoin is that it'll never really stop going up, for as long as governments can print money the price of the asset will continue to climb at a very rapid rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:06:34

The issue with that is it doesn't really solve what I'm trying to solve, they're basically just building tools on top of Telegram. I'm building an alternative to Telegram that's tailored directly to crypto users by putting some of the top projects directly in front of my users without them needing to find niche and hidden communities online. Cryptochat aims to make cryptocurrency more accessible and less of a walled garden, which I believe is crucial to adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:37:07
Eventually I'll have a PC and Android version. Right now I'm focusing on building out the back-end and getting as close to feature complete as possible on iOS, then I'll build out the Android, Web and Desktop versions. 
That sounds like a lot of work but really it's not really that bad and I expect to have all of those versions in place within the next six months. 
There's no way I'd even have a hope to compete with Telegram or Discord without them so they're coming! lol
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:03:52
Of course! I'm doing this for the community, the key to adoption is the spread of information and awareness.

The exchanges aren't selling you bitcoin, you're buying bitcoin for fiat from their other users. Hence the term "exchange". But yes I agree with you people who are selling are stupid, aside from the miners who have to to keep the lights on. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:44:38
Yeah, for the email I have plans on adding it to the account page as an optional account security feature, this is actually planned in my Septemeber update. 
As for price, I was thinking about listing it alongside each coin, the only problem is I really don't want to direct the discussion to just price. I think there's so much more to crypto than just the price, and I'd really like the users to feel like that's not all they have to talk about. I might make it an option though, the other issue is getting that price data on a large scale has become pretty expensive, CoinMarketCap started charging for access to their API on a per-user basis and it's pretty pricey, so I may have to hold off on that until I get some revenue or funding.

Great question, 
For me it would be much easier to do the web version first, I come from a background of a software engineer with most of my experience on the web which is exactly why I wanted to start with the mobile app and get out of my comfort zone immediately. 
Another benefit here is that I'm using a technology called React for both mobile and the web version, so porting between the two should be relatively seamless, it's actually the same tech Instagram uses for their app/web site. 
And I'm well aware of who Pavel Durov is, luckily I'll be competing on tech and not modeling ability :)

To add to this, gold has always been incredibly valuable throughout the history of the world. King's hoarded it, the entire California Gold Rush was because of it, and of course the dollar used to be backed by it. 
Our modern take on gold is that it's less valuable than it was throughout history, and that's partly true because it really isn't backing anything anymore. It's valuable because we say it's valuable (aside from a few small niche uses of Gold). 
But what happens, when say, the US government starts mining bitcoin in order to pay back its tens of trillions of dollars of debt to other countries? What happens when other economies start doing the same? This could VERY WELL HAPPEN, bitcoin is really the only thing that has the ability to pay down such a large debt. You can't just print the money otherwise that adds more debt, but what you can do is mine bitcoin and send it off to other countries based on the current dollar market value of the coin. I think this will start happening in the 2020's or 2030's

Sure, it's a good questions. 
The number one problem I'm hoping/would like to solve with this is the disjointed and scattered nature of the chat applications the community has seemed to gravitate to. 
For streamers and gamers, Discord works really well and has largely replaced Telegram in their eyes. This is a huge community of people, it's certainly not a niche market. I think this is a trend, why should crypto-enthusiasts have to rely on tools that aren't geared towards us? 
So,  I'm trying to build the Discord for Crypto. The problem it solves is it creates a community of enthusiasts and experts in a single location. I know that sounds incredibly ambitious and it's early but I'm very committed to this.

@_date: 2018-08-06 21:34:34
It's far more likely than any other altcoin to "win" in the long run if that's what you're saying. Bitcoin has name recognization and is by far the most secure blockchain on the planet. 
The problem with alts (which again is what I'm assuming you're referring to) is that their hash-power becomes increasing diluted the more of them that there are. Eventually you'll have alts that are so weak that anybody could overpower them with a little bit of hash-power and invalidate the entire blockchain, this is currently impossible with bitcoin and most likely forever will be as the price continues to increase. 
I think we'll see a pretty well-known chain get hit with a 51% attack and that will cause lots of alts to collapse and money to flood back to bitcoin, the higher the price of a cryto-currency the better the security, by owning bitcoin you're basically paying a premium for the most secure blockchain in the world which is why I think it'll "win" without a doubt. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:05:18
There's no such thing as "sustainability" in bitcoin, the price of bitcoin at any given time is a function of the current number of buyers and sellers averaged across all markets. 
The people who are the most likely to sell at any given moment are miners, they have to in order to pay the electric bill. That's why we've consistently seen prices go higher after the halving, because miners have less bitcoin so sell and therefore bitcoin becomes more scarce. 
It's an algorithm, it'll repeat itself over and over and over. There's no limit to how high it'll go

People invest in things because they want to get rich, for as long as there's greed there's going to be people who want to buy bitcoin. 
Gold holds long-term value because it's scarce and we all agree that it has value, not everybody who buys gold is going to make it into a chain or a watch. Yet you can take any piece of gold and take it to a pawn shop and get market rate for it at any time because those guys who work at and own the pawn shops want to make money; they're greedy, that's what gives things value.

Thanks a lot for the advice, I really do appreciate it. 
I should have definitely posted a description, I was at work and just wanted to quickly show off what I had thus far. 
This product is the result of really about two months of part-time development, I have a ways to go, I told myself I'd commit about a year to it and see where it goes. I agree the screenshots and description need work, that's great advice. 
As for WHY you should use the app, I have a ton of really cool features planned. One of which is the ability to tip other users in the crypto-currency of your choice. This can lead to cross-pollination so to speak, where perhaps you're chatting with someone who's a Monero user but doesn't know much about the Lightning network for example. You could tip that user on the LN, this could lead to both of you learning more about how LN works and further driving adoption. 
I have a feature planned that will allow you to type a phone number  in, tip that phone number with any currency you want, and then that phone number will get a text. Obviously they'll have to sign up (Good for user adoption) but once they do, they'll have access to all their tips. 
This will essentially act as a new way to send crypto, as well as a way to drive user adoption and build a better network. 
This will all happen within a reddit-like setting, where the chats act as a kind of social network hub.
Thanks for the well wishes! I'll be at this for at least a year, so if it doesn't appeal to you yet (which is understandable, it's a very minimum viable product at the moment) check back every so often. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:44:06

It is completely and utterly unfair to steal from the very people who were the most heavily invested in Crypto and got this whole thing started in the first place. By forking bitcoin and calling that branch bitcoin cash you're stealing. 
The irony is that the free market is a very powerful thing and bcash supporters are trying to steal from the largest pool of crypto investors on the planet, we're talking billionaires at this point. 
I hope bcash gets dumped so hard just based on the principle of the matter. You have to realize that the majority of bitcoin cash holders are actually bitcoin holders, it's a fork. Wait for the dump. The tech is a knockoff. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:05:13
LOL. 
It's now "crashed" and come back from the dead to shatter records and people's perception at least three times. How many more times does it need to happen before people understand that it's a pattern that will repeat itself over and over and over again? 
Bitcoin is an investment, that's true. You must be pretty young but most people hold their investments for years. I do think bitcoin is relatively useless as a currency, it's a problem that I don't think even needs to be solved, we don't need a new form of currency we just need a place to put our money that will appreciate in value over time without being tied to something extra like the stock market or real-estate. A lot like what gold used to be but digital, something anybody with a smartphone could purchase in an instant without having to go to a place to buy gold, figure out exactly how much to shave off a gold bar, and then finding someplace to store that gold. Nobody has time for that anymore. Bitcoin is like gold 2.0 but on a global scale and it will be seen as the world's store of wealth. 
but that's completely off topic. 
I think eventually bitcoin will make its way into people's 401K's and at that point, it'll moon again. Now tell me, which one do you think the financial institutions will implement for 401K adoption? Bitcoin? Tron? Monero? I think bitcoin's a pretty good bet.

Like reddit, but more tailored to the crypto community. 
I want to integrate LN tipping directly into the app, and I also want to have more exchanging of ideas from within the app. 
Reddit kind of acts like an information silo in crypto, you can't very easily go learn about other technologies if you only stick to one subreddit. There's so many different projects and ideas out there and most people aren't aware of them. 
I want to try to consolidate that information into one community.

Actually, the "cause" here is pretty easy to understand. 
People are in high need of a sound form of money, inflation is a real thing and people are feeling it. Bitcoin beats inflation soundly and has done so consistently since its inception. It would actually be abnormal for it not to increase at this point, given what we know about it. 
The causation here is an algorithm that beats inflation, this should always correlate with higher prices over the long term (for as long as people want to increase their wealth)

No, all the third world has to do is start mining cryptocurrency to start having a share. 
Ideally, the governments mine bitcoin, and then sell that bitcoin to citizens for the original fiat. This keeps the wealth in that country and local economies can begin to flourish. 
In practice however, when dealing with third world governments, corruption is NEVER a problem and their governments always seem to run smoothly and without upheaval. So no issues there.

The price won't ever stabilize for as long as people are willing to trade bitcoin for fiat, it'll always fluctuate with a propensity to grow in the long term due to inflation. It's how supply and demand works.  
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:21:08
You can't really price in the halving, it's impossible. 
The current value of bitcoin is a function of the current supply and demand. At the time of the halving the new supply issued to miners will be cut in half, and the miners are the ones who are most likely to sell their bitcoin because they need to pay the electric bill. All of a sudden they have less to sell, if the demand stays roughly the same at the time of the halving, the price will naturally increase over time. That event is VERY hard to price in because the price of bitcoin at any given moment depends on the current number of buyers and sellers. 
Or think about it this way: If the halving DOESN'T increase price, a lot of miners will be forced out of "business" so to speak. That doesn't bode will for the health of bitcoin or the algorithm. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:17:13
Well, demand in the case of bitcoin is interesting because a single bitcoin can be broken down almost infinitely, this is part of the reason WHY bitcoin is allowed to rise to the heights that it has and why the tech is so revolutionary. 
If nobody was trying to buy bitcoin over the course of the next hour and everybody was trying to sell, in theory the price would drop until you found a buyer. 
It's borderline impossible for bitcoin to every dip below $1000 dollars because of the buy orders on the books that will buy up the bitcoin at that price and drive the price back up. In other words bitcoin is fairly stable (believe it or not) 
The other side of the equation, that isn't mentioned by OP but is equally as important in determining the price, is the SUPPLY side. What's happening is that everyone is buying up bitcoin and holding it, this restricts the supply, and when someone goes to buy there's fewer people willing to sell, and so, in theory, the price increases until you find someone willing to sell bitcoin at said price. 
The way bitcoin works is that miners are getting rewarded every 15 minutes or so, most of those miners are selling their bitcoin almost immediately to pay for the cost of mining. This keeps the system generally in balance and the price relatively stable. But when the HALVING happens, and all of sudden they're getting 3.25 bitcoins instead of 6.5 every 15 minutes. You'll see the new supply GREATLY restricted and the price will likely skyrocket, and people see the price rise more people will want to buy, and this will increase demand for an already more scarce item (this is what we saw over and over again when prices rose to a dollar, one hundred dollars, one thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand and so on, and it will just continue happening) 
TLDR: buy bitcoin, it's rigged in your favor
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:59:10
And yet in reality it wouldn't, as most people don't even own a full bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:12:48
No, 
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
If you're here I'm assuming you believe bitcoin is worth something and will be worth even more in the future, this would constitute a good store of value (depending on who you ask, some say bitcoin will go to zero in the near future, don't listen to them) 
Money, on the other hand, is consistently being printed by the US government and therefore losing its value over time. Fiat currency is widely considered to be a poor store of value these days due to the rate of inflation. Cash is, on the other hand, a better store of value than let's say a 2010 Ford Focus for example. 
If you scroll down on the article you'll see that "gold is considered to be a good store of value" because it generally gains value over time even though Gold isn't nearly as liquid as cash

I've also heard that LightCoin could play a roll on the lightning network which could then be atomically swapped for bitcoin without anyone knowing. 
There's plenty of time to iron these details out though, I'm very optimistic about bitcoin
The bigger task (in my opinion) is getting the lightning network functional
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:26:30
I theory no, because everybody has a price they'd sell at (would you continue to hold bitcoin if it hit 1,000,000)?. Unless bitcoin replaces the dollar entirely.

It's because they're not able to, on a personal level they certainly can but that type of purchase would need universal approval from everybody to the board of directors to the CEO and just about every middle manager underneath them, it's always a good time to buy bitcoin because in the coming years as it gains more respect and trust throughout the world the banks will start buying (and likely mining) it

Inflation doesn't "come back"
Once the money supply increases it doesn't just vanish, it may take some time to trickle out to the general public (in the form of higher salaries, bigger bonuses, larger investments and so on) but once it's in circulation it contributes to inflation. 
The government printed billions of dollars during the great recession and that money mostly went to wallstreet, which is why you're currently seeing one of the largest pumps in stocks in history. The stock market has increased substantially since the great recession and that's largely due to inflation. 
The problem is that any currency that's subject to inflation is not a sound one, just take a look at the national debt, that's basically all IOU money that will almost certainly never be fully re-payed. The only reason we CAN have a national debt is because of inflationary currency. 
Obviously, there's only 21 million bitcoins for the entire world to compete in owning, so it's by far the most sound form of money available and the competition to own as much as possible will eventually make all forms of paper currency obsolete.

It's already been adopted, it was adopted the first time someone decided to exchange their dollars for it. 
Did you know for hundreds of years one of the first forms of currency was shells before metal coins were invented? The dollars you hold in your wallet are essentially worthless and to even further drive home that point most of the dollars you hold are just digits on a server of an international bank. 
I think in the future we'll hold bitcoin for our long-term savings and still use some form of "paper" currency for our day to day purchases. As much as people hate to hear it here I don't think bitcoin is a very practical payment apparatus, at least not yet anyway.

I'll answer that. Yes. Without a doubt. 
A very basic understanding of two things will draw you to that conclusion: 
A. The Bitcoin Protocol. 
B. Supply and Demand. 
As new supply dwindles and demand stays relatively constant (minus the weak hands who are leaving in droves) the price will increase, thus bringing in new weak hands, which will further increase the price. 
I predict Bitcoin's price will grow indefinitely, for as long as governments continue to print money the price of bitcoin will increase permanently over time.

ehh I don't know man, if you look back historically at when something like this happened last time it was from April 2013 to November of 2013. Two huge spikes in the span of one halving. 
We went to like 224 in April then dipped heavily and then ran up to like 1200 in November/December. That's roughly a 5X return from the ATH. 
We might seriously be on our way to 100K. 5X of about 20K

Mmm it’s tough to say, keep in mind it would be unprecedented if we hit a new ath before the halving. We could hover between 10-15K for a few months to a year but my guess is we’ll see some type of minor correction that brings us below 10K and then we’ll shoot up past 20K after the halving.

Miners aren't selling excess supply at the moment because the price keeps going up, so you have increased demand met with newly limited supply. Nobody's selling and lots more people are buying.
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:25:54
Not true at all, if you wanted to use it you’d either have to buy it with cash or mine it first so every user starts with a transaction. 
The people actively selling bitcoin the most are the miners, those people are maintaining the network and need to sell what they earn to pay for the electricity costs. Are they not actively using bitcoin every day?

There doesn't necessarily need to be more "volume" for the price to increase. If everybody decided to not sell any of their bitcoin, the price would increase indefinitely until someone decided to sell, which would be the new asking price. 
This happens on a global scale every second of every minute across hundreds of exchanges, the average price across all of those exchanges is the one you see on CMC. (which is why the price you see on coinbase is always slightly different than CMC, CMC just takes the average of all exchanges to get a global average price) 
But if nobody on earth ever sold bitcoin again, and millions of people were all bidding to try to buy those bitcoins, the price would just increase vertically until there was enough supply to meet that demand. Everyone has a price they'd sell bitcoin at, but in theory, if bitcoin is truly "priceless" the price could hit a million, a billion, you name it. 
That's what's happening now. People always look too heavily at the demand side of the supply and demand equation, that's a fallacy. Supply and Demand are equally important in determining the price of a finite asset.
In short, if demand stays constant and all of a sudden supply gets greatly restricted, the price will go up without any new "volume" entering the marketplace. But alas when the price goes up people tend to pay attention and demand/volume increases as well, which creates the snowball affect you're seeing now.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:02:40

No you're completely wrong. 
First of all, there is an "unlimited" amount of "wealth" in this world for as long as governments are allowed to print money. If governments decided to buy bitcoin the price would go up so much it would hyper-inflate most currencies, because they can create money at will. 
Yes you can expect demand to stay constant because of a unique feature that bitcoin has, it's infinitely divisible. You're right, if something increases from 1 to 1000 dollars that would put it out of the price range of most people, but if I could divide that object almost infinitely then that barrier wouldn't be there and I could still buy a fraction of what you're selling for the money that I have available to invest. 
You say, "It would take 21 quadrillion dollars to pay 1 billion dollars for every bitcoin" but you're just using a number that sounds big and scary today to refute my argument. Numbers mean nothing. If I told somebody in 1900 that the US national debt in the year 2019 would be 22.4 trillion dollars and counting they'd look at me like I was crazy, and by the way, that's just the US national debt. Bitcoin is a global currency.

Don’t take a profit until bitcoin can change your life in some meaningful way. Have 10’s of thousands of dollars in student loans and are burdened by them? Sell when you can pay them off. Can’t afford a down payment because the housing market is overinflated? Sell when you can make one. Can’t afford a car but need transportation? Sell when you can buy one.
Our generation has been crippled by an economy that was rigged by boomers. Ever notice how no one over 60 owns bitcoin? This technology is revolutionary and will help a generation that’s been crippled financially.
For the first time in my life I’m in the green, and I’m not talking bitcoin I’m talking as a whole. Between car debt, student loans and an economy that punishes savers I’ve always carried more debt than I did savings. That changed during this last bull run and a few years of steady dollar cost averaging. What a time to be alive.

Well no, if all 21 million were all sent in individual transactions then you physically wouldn’t be able to pay the mining fee because no more than 21 million exist. 
I THINK you can send bitcoin without a fee, but your transaction would obviously be at the very bottom of the queue but I could be wrong, the bitcoin core software may need you to attach something to pay the miners and in that case you physically couldn’t do it. 
If you can send bitcoin without a fee then it would just take a very, very long time to process your transaction. 
No need to worry though because even if 21 million satoshis were distributed to 21 million unique people that would be akin to trying to get them all to jump at the same time. Just very very unlikely and not worth worrying about. Not even including all the bitcoin that are lost or locked away in accounts that haven’t been accessed like Satoshi’s

you're not gonna see hyperinflation that's my point. You'll see high rates of inflation on luxury goods that are in high demand but not on commodities. 
The banks own most of the debt in this world - I'll paint this picture for you. Image bitcoin hit $500,000 dollars tomorrow, the price spikes people cash out and you come away with $500,000. 
The first thing most people are going to do is pay off their debt, of which most people in this world owe some whether it's student loans, car loans, mortgages ect. All of that money goes directly to the bank, but all of that money is already on the bank's asset sheets so it's basically just break even for them. Without going into too much detail that's what happened during the financial crisis in 2008, we hit a recession, people lost their jobs, they couldn't pay their mortgage, the banks then had to sit on assets they couldn't sell and they became illiquid - and so the US government stepped in basically paid off the "Bad Assets", taxpayers bailed them out, mass controversy, bitcoin gets invented yadayadaya. 
The banks are going to be sitting on piles of cash in the future with very little to do with it, they'll probably at some point get the greenlight to invest that cash in bitcoin - thus the price will go up even further, that might be a big catalyst towards the next wave of price increase - who knows. 
You will not see hyperinflation on commodities because all of that extra money will be locked away in a digital vault at your bank and just because YOU YOURSELF have more money doesn't mean you'll want or need to buy more coffee, gas, or groceries
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:19:05
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:34:14
Why? It's not like bitcoin's going to hit a million and everybody will say "You know what I've always wanted but couldn't afford? More coffee" 
There's things that are definitely more subject to supply and demand than others, luxury goods being one of them but not commodities. Expect the price of a new lambo to hit a million before bitcoin but not groceries, gas, or anything that's a trivial expense. 
It'll be interesting to see if the costs of flights skyrocket, that's what I'd be more worried about.
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:50:40
commodities don't work like that, you won't go out and buy more coffee just cause you have a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoin. 
You might try to take more flights and travel more, you might think about purchasing a luxury car - so will everybody, and thus those types of goods will see some serious inflation. Most of that inflation will be artificial, Lamborghini creates an artificial supply restriction to maintain a luxury status.
It'll be interesting to see what happens to the housing market, will more people rent in the future or buy? That's a tough question. You'll definitely see some inflation but who knows how much
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:42:14
I agree with the first point, but the second is wrong. If you alter the code in any meaningful way then you're no longer using bitcoin - not including improvements like segwit that don't alter the blockchain

That thinking only applies to the irrational forces of the free market and the business cycle. 
This is a computer algorithm you're looking at. Bitcoin is an algorithm. I can guarantee that the supply will halve in May of 2020, I can also almost guarantee people will continue to want to get rich well into the future. Those two facts bode well for bitcoin.   
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:56:56
It's supply and demand
on a very small scale, you can picture it like this: Let's say I have one token that two people want and I have no set price, so essentially those two people will bid on that token, obviously the person with more money wins and you can say that token is worth whatever the highest bidder paid for it. 
That's kind of how bitcoin works, what happens is all of the people willing to sell at this exact moment in time (picture yourself on coinbase pressing the sell button at this exact moment) plus all of the people who have sell orders at this exact price are the current supply of bitcoin. 
All of the people willing to buy at this exact price in this exact moment plus all of the people with buy orders at this exact price are the current demand. 
If the demand exceeds the current supply, the price moves up to the next unit. This all happens in real-time across every live exchange on the planet. The price you see on coinmarketcap is an average of all reputable exchanges (this is also why arbitrage exists, it's impossible to keep all exchanges in sync because there's no central authority saying "This is the price of bitcoin", if I look at two exchanges, and I see one listing bitcoin at $10,000 dollars and another listing at $10,001 dollars, it would be in my best interest to purchase bitcoin on the exchange listing it for $10,000 dollars. I could then sell my new bitcoins on the higher exchange and make a quick profit. Many people do this which is what keeps exchanges relatively in sync) 
The price of bitcoin goes up if demand exceeds supply. Which means if not a lot of people are buying today or a lot of people decide to sell, the price will go down. The opposite is true if many people are deciding to hold and many people are trying to buy, that's what causes bitcoin to skyrocket. 
Lol I feel like I'm ranting but I find it fascinating, it's not really math it's much more just simple economics
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:12:39
Absolutely, I don't have a doubt in my mind. Bitcoin has the potential to reverse the debt we as individuals and society owe. I really see it as the only thing that will eventually save us from 100,000 dollar student loan debt, an out of control national debt, million-dollar single-family home prices and so on. What the web did for the spread of information, bitcoin will do for the spread of wealth. It's only an algorithm after all.

Yes, most crypto that I'm aware of can run a side chain. From my understanding, all a side chain is is an "entry" point on the main blockchain and an "exit" point. What happens in the middle, otherwise known as the "side-chain" doesn't matter as long as it's implemented properly and returns the funds that people are expecting to the main chain at some point (which, theoretically could be an unlimited amount of time, currency could live on the side chain for days, months or years and it wouldn't matter as long as at any point the involved parties could settle their payments on the main blockchain) 
Anyone can create a new blockchain, and theoretically anybody could create a side-chain under an existing currency, whether anybody would use it or not is a different story. 
Yes, in theory a side-chain could hold more value at any given time than the main blockchain because in essence you're sending your money off the main chain and onto the side-chain to then work out a settlement to send back to the main blockchain. But that money could stay on a side-chain, as mentioned previously, forever. As long as the protocol is sound and at any moment you can retrieve your funds off of the side-chain then it would all be fair game.

It’s whitepaper states that it does, but what’s stopping someone from creating a side-chain that does exactly what ethereum does but better? 
Now granted there are some very smart people working on ethereum too and i don’t think a Bitcoin side-chain could completely disrupt ethereum but the potential is now there. It’s very interesting. 
Ultimately I think ethereum will have its own side-chains that will mitigate the scaling problems that it’s having. Joseph Poon is actually working on an ethereum side-chain if I’m not mistaken, and he was key in the lightning networks development so I have no doubt it’ll be well though out and work well. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 05:16:09
Because it's an algorithm. Bitcoin is literally just a computer algorithm that you're investing in which is the future of investments. The halving will reduce the new issuance of supply and make the markets less liquid, the price will naturally increase from there. Assuming people still want to get rich three to four years from now, that will most likely increase the demand and the price will skyrocket as new money gets in on the investment. This cycle will repeat for one hundred years and the economy will be revolutionized in the same way the world wide web revolutionized how we shop, learn, and spend our time.

Sure, 
I'd envision that you'd be able to work for around four years and put most of your savings into bitcoin. When the algorithm takes off, you'd have enough money to go to school and pay your way through, you could also take time off from work if you really wanted to and live off of your earnings from the last boom. 
By the way, this is already happening, the people who were steadily buying during the last run-up are living large right now. But that cycle will come again in a few years and a new round of people will have the opportunity to have a massive influx of money. This could be used to buy a home debt free, pay for school without loans, and the government could use it to reverse out of debt. This helps to erase the debt that people hold. 
Again it's already happening whether you've spotted the trend already, will spot the trend after the next cycle or never spot the trend and remain cynical for the rest of your life doesn't bother me at all. I just keep steadily buying and waiting for that halving. 
I think bitcoin is going to restructure the economy in the same way the web did to the way that we communicate, share information and learn. The way we're communicating right now would have been laughed at 25 years ago, and people like you would've been a cynic.

A very basic understanding of supply and demand will tell you what it'll be worth in the future, and as long as people are trying to increase their wealth there will always be demand. 
It's all very simple.

How are the contracts actually settled, or who settles them for that matter? Is it an automatic process or is it manual? 
The whole page reloads for every page swap, it's built like a SPA but that just looks sloppy in my opinion. Is there anyway to get that spinning circle to only appear in the center of the page and still render the title bar/footer ect? That would be much better.

Why would the Chinese sit on coins they knew they couldn't sell? They'll dump their supply (which we're seeing) and the market will correct itself eventually but not after a steep decline. Look to hit 2000 by December, don't be left holding the bag.

There is no intrinsic value in anything. The value of something is dictated by what the market will pay for it. 
If I forked bitcoin a million times would I be a multi-trillionaire? I would, but only if I could convince other people to buy the many forks that I created of it. Let's say I fork bitcoin and call it bitcoin dust, let's say I somehow get bitcoin dust listed on a major exchange. The only way anybody can sell their bitcoin dust is if, you guessed it bucko, there's somebody willing to buy it. The problem is who the hell is gonna buy bitcoin dust? It turns out quite a few people during times of bubbles, not so many people as the hype dies down and more people try to "create money" by doing forks. The more forks there are, the more scattered the demand is, and thus the harder it becomes to sell the "currency" that you hold.
it's definitely not rocket science, it's economics

If no more bitcoins were being rewarded per block (bitcoins entering the system, which will happen) and no fees were paid what would be the incentive for people to run mining software to process the blockchain? At some point, many years down the road Bitcoin will be run entirely on fees.

What makes you think people are going to wake up one day and not want bitcoin? 
The only reason that would happen is if there was a gaping hole in the security of the coin that proved it to be insecure, the coin has been around for almost a decade now and its security has been proven so I doubt that would happen. 
You may argue that governments will step in but if you look at history, that very VERY rarely happens with disruptive technology. There may be regulations at some point (which would achually be good for bitcoin, believe it or not). If you look at things like the internet, airplanes, rocketships, cell phones, even nuclear bombs, they were all adopted in some way by governments. Governments are made up of people remember, and if technology benefits people then generally it's a safe bet that it will be adopted.

The problem with your argument is that's not true at all, people buy bitcoin all of the time because it's almost infinitely divisible, which is the exact opposite of stocks and gold and one of the things that makes it so interesting. 
To use the previous high as an example - It's not that people weren't buying at 20,000, as a matter of fact, more people were buying at that moment in time than at any other point, the problem was that the base of people that were holding were too rich and decided to sell some or most of their bitcoin. This led to a chain reaction that drove the price down.

Depends on what you want to do in crypto in all honesty. 
If you want to work on exchanges and the web platforms that power them, learn React, it's very hot right now and most modern web platforms are being built with it. If you'd like to work on the back-end logic that powers all of that I've seen open positions for everything from C# to GO, generally if you'd like to work on the web then learning javascript + one backend language (python, C GO) is a good bet. (React is a library built in javascript if you're not familiar, VERY hot right now, especially in the valley where most of this development is happening)  
If you'd like to work with Ethereum, you could start by learning a bit about solidity, the language used to write smart contracts for Ethereum. Ethereum's is a long shot though, it has very big ideas and aspirations and believe a lot of it will come to fruition I just don't see a lot of corporate level hiring being done specifically for ethereum just yet, that might change in the next three years though. (ultimately follow your passion, if you're passionate about ethereum then go for it)
If you want to work directly with crypto-currency source, you should obviously learn about cryptographic hash functions but also most of the core code is written in C++ so definitely become strong with that. Most of the source code for the more prominent tokens is open source, so getting access to the underlying code won't be an issue. Understanding it on the other hand is very, VERY difficult and probably not possible for a first year CS student. If you study the source actively for maybe a year and learn C++ you'd probably be able to learn and internalize how it works but then you have the extra layer of complexity which is cryptography which is another field entirely.

Two Points: 
1: Very few people understood all of the jargon and how the web worked in 1997, could you explain an online shopping cart to a 70 year old in 1997? I'm a software engineer and even I'd have trouble explaining that concept. There were definitely many people that did understand the web in 97, but a vast majority of the people didn't. 
2: The fundamental role of a currency is to represent value in the exchange of goods and services. In other words money, or currency, only has the value that humans give it. ALL money is a mirage, whether it be fiat, gold, silver, or bitcoin these things have meaning and value because humans decided that they have meaning. Try explaining Bitcoin in those terms to your father.

And you're not understanding what I'm saying. I fully understand that Gold and Diamonds have utility in the real world and I'm countering that by saying Bitcoin has utility in its protocol. I know Bitcoin isn't completely anonymous and can be traced back to the owner of the wallet but it still beats the hell out of cash when trying to do international business. I just don't think you see the scope of what it can be, this is like the internet in the 90's my friend. Why not invest? Gambling is the complete opposite of this. If I bet all my money on black and red comes out I leave with nothing. If Bitcoin loses most of its value tomorrow I still have an asset I can use in the real world that's backed by incredibly deep layers of Math and a ledger that's beginning to gain trust all around the world. 
You're a fool for not investing in this.

That may be a good hedge against all of this if you're not comfortable taking your coins off of an exchange and backing them up in a hardware wallet. You won't get both coins but at least you won't end up with a dud currency. The only risk is if Litecoin depreciates significantly while you wait it out. Ethereum may be a better hedge come to think of it, it's stayed relatively stable. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:02:14
So the real answer is that there's a limited amount of coins that can enter the system, but an unlimited amount that can be mined (keep in mind the act of mining is processing the cryptographic ledger, and you pay a fee to the miners for their electricity and processing power) so miners will always get a fee. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:09:40
No. The difference in that example is that it became illegal for people to produce and sell alcohol. Bitcoin will continue to be produced at the same rate, it's determined by an algorithm. People will be unable to ACQUIRE Bitcoin and therefore the SUPPLY will stay the same but the DEMAND will drop thus dropping the price. Economics 101 my friend.
I'll explain how exchanges work for you because you clearly don't understand. The exchange dictates the price. If there are only two people in the world who use Bitcoin, John has 1 Bitcoin and Mike has 0, John offers to sell his Bitcoin on an exchange for 1 dollar and Mike agrees to pay that. Mike gets John's Bitcoin, John gets Mike's dollar and the price of Bitcoin is 1 dollar. 
If there are three users of Bitcoin in the world and Mike owns 1 Bitcoin John owns 0 Bitcoins and Steve owns 0 Bitcoins and John wants to buy his Bitcoin back for 1 Dollar but Steve also wants to buy Mike's Bitcoin for 1 dollar then Mike can raise the price of his Bitcoin to 2 dollars. John is unwilling to pay 2 dollars but Steve is, so Steve gives Mike his two dollars Steve gets Mike's Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin is now 2 dollars. 
If all of a sudden Mike is banned from purchasing bitcoin it doesn't matter how much he wants to pay for it he can't. Now Steve wants to Sell, the only buyer is John who is only willing to pay 1 dollar. Steve has no choice but to sell for 1 dollar. Steve loses money. 
You're Steve.

It's stock as much as it is to say that owning diamonds is having stock in Tiffany's or Macey's. Bitcoin is as asset, a tangible good that gets its value based on what other humans think that value is. 
Bitcoin has the intrinsic value of being an anonymous and decentralized currency, while other currencies are regulated and centralized, but you already knew that. 
It may not always have this high of a value when trading against the US dollar, it may some day replace the US dollar, but one thing you can't say is that it doesn't have real utility. We now have a way to send a store of value anonymously from one person to the next across the internet without any third party interference. That in and of itself is the value of crypto-currency.

Interesting, I'd recommend making that information public in the FAQ, I know the average customer probably won't care about the details of how things are settled but for me it held me back from making an initial deposit. Just a simple Q: "How are contracts settled" A: MGM Grand API ect. would be useful. 
That's actually very impressive if you didn't use a framework to build out the front-end. When I say SPA I'm referring to a Single Page Application (think trading sites like GDAX) which is just a modern approach to building web applications. The issue I was experiencing appeared to be a common pitfall when building SPA's where the entire application will re-render, causing the entire page to go blank and in my case I'm seeing a loading wheel. If you were using a traditional library like Angular or React I might've been able to offer some help on that front but given it's just vanilla javascript I'm sure the problem is very code specific.

We won't "trend" upwards for another 3 1/2 to 4 years.

Oh your next door neighbor sold his 1.4 million dollar home in a day huh? Tell me more. Nobody ever lies on the internet. 
And by the way, I'm not necessarily arguing that it's impossible to sell a million dollar home, what I'm saying is that we're very clearly experiencing another housing bubble which is caused by easy access to loans that people shouldn't be getting. Bubbles are created by loans, IOU fiat money that's easy to access. Look at the student debt crisis, saddled by students who got loans and never finished college because they probably weren't qualified enough to be there in the first place. That generation is the generation you'll be selling your home to (if ever), that generation won't be able to afford your "million dollar" home because they're not making any more than you did when you purchased it, wages are stagnant, compound that by the extra debt millennials are carrying and this country is in for one hell of a real estate correction. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:20:46
Because the price of bitcoin at any given time is the function of the current supply and demand. If two people want to buy one bitcoin at a price of 5 dollars, and there's only one bitcoin being sold at the current moment they decide to buy, and each have five dollars to spend then they'll each get 0.5 bitcoin as the price of that bitcoin will increase organically to 10 dollars. This process happens individually on each exchange over and over millions of times per day, that's what dictates the price of bitcoin. It's just a function of the current supply and demand at any given moment. 
If tomorrow absolutely nobody wanted to buy bitcoin, literally nobody, the price would hit ZERO dollars. (Bitcoin would essentially be worthless)
if tomorrow absolutely nobody would sell their bitcoin, no matter what the price, the price would hit INFINITY dollars. (Bitcoin essentially becomes priceless)
Obviously neither scenario is practical, and the current price of bitcoin is somewhere in between those two extremes.

Have you actually tried to sell your home in Fort Collins? Because your net worth isn't the same as the wealth you have in your pocket, which is being systematically eaten by inflation. Your home is just a symptom of that. Go ahead and try to sell your 1 million dollar, 20+ year old home in Colorado and tell me how well that goes for you. Couple that with the fact that your potential buyers are now debt-ridden millennials with an extra 50K worth of student loan debt EACH and they're not making any more than you did at their age minus inflation. Good Luck. 
I'd say invest in bitcoin, the whole "debt is good" thing is about to hit the fan hard. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:42:08
All fiat based economies are fragile, another housing bubble is right around the corner, trust me on that one. Inflation is being felt all across America, we're possibly entering a global trade war, the stock market continues to see all-time highs, meaning a serious correction could be imminent. Student loan debt continues to climb out of control, something that will undoubtedly stagnate the economy in the coming years, as young people and people trying to re-train themselves are burdened by it. Wages are widely reported as being stagnant, so it's not like we're earning more by being significantly more educated than our parents or grandparents were relatively speaking. The average American has less than 1000 dollars in savings.  
In all honesty, I really hope that we don't see another massive financial crisis. But I honest to god believe that the only plausible way to dig ourselves out of this hole is to have bitcoin skyrocket so people can get themselves out of debt and actually be able to afford down payments on homes and build wealth. 
I think if anything saves us from another global meltdown it'll be bitcoin.

I didn’t say it would happen during a crisis, the economy is actually very good right now as OP mentioned. The problem, as I described, is that it’s very fragile fiat based growth that could very easily implode on us. Our economy is basically a house of cards. 
Bitcoin is stable money that can only ever increase in value over the long term because governments can’t just print more when they need it. 
That form of money provides real growth and a hell of a lot more stability than a fiat based one. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:23:34
Wrong. 
There's always a new supply of bitcoin trickling into the ecosystem via mining rewards, the miners are almost always forced to sell their bitcoin to pay for the electricity they use to run the algorithm. This process will continue for over 100 years assuring that there's always a circulating supply. Keep in mind also that if nobody ever sold their bitcoin (including miners) the price of bitcoin would go up indefinitely until someone did sell their bitcoin, and all rational people have a price that they'd exchange their bitcoin for, unless of course fiat currency in the future becomes worthless.

Novelties with value, kind of like collectibles. I just can't see many companies willing to accept those currencies unless we come up with a way sometime in the future to swap currencies on the fly (without going through an exchange), for instance we'd need some type of protocol when paying to pay with whatever currency we want and then swap that currency with the one the seller would accept on the fly at the point of sale. I think that could very well happen in the future in which case Dogecoin and Litecoin and many of the others would retain a lot of value because people could actually use them but at this point the technology doesn't exist.

@_date: 2018-04-18 18:16:41
I think bitcoin will act as the world's savings fund, or a global store of wealth so to speak. I think other crypto will be important, particularly Ethereum, which will act more like a form of gas or electricity. Other's still will be looked at as novelties but still valuable (Dogecoin, Litecoin). Others will have value strictly within the applications that utilize them, perhaps coins like GameToken will actually take off in the gaming space. FileCoin will play a roll if IPFS takes off. Ethereum, as previously mentioned, will play a huge roll in DAPPS, automation, and DAO's. 
I think the most immediate impact on the world though will be through bitcoin, people will get immensely rich off of bitcoin over the next few decades which will free people up to work on the projects that they want, and then we'll start to see development on ethereum and other technology start to really take off.

@_date: 2019-05-17 01:56:15
Well, I think you're wrong. 
The price will only hit 140K if there's mass FOMO, which I think will happen, I actually think we'll go far above 140K probably to the 300K range but it won't last for more than a month and then the price will come down slowly and eventually stay around 40-50K for a few years. 
So take all of your math and divide it by 1/3. 
We won't see sustained 140K prices until after 2026 at which point most of us here will be driving Teslas or some sort of electric car. If it's the environment you're worried about all of that new wealth should give us the ability to invest heavily in green energy, wouldn't surprise me if at some point it would be illegal to mine bitcoin using any other power than green energy.

Ehh it’s risky, I wouldn’t trust a third party app by any means, you’re better off keeping the coins on a trusted exchange than some app. 
As long as you know the private key to an address that has currency in it you’re fine, as you can always get access to that address by utilizing the private key. The bitcoin doesn’t live anywhere but on the network inside the blockchain, the private key is what you’re looking for
Don’t use a password you thought of for this, use a trusted tool to generate a key that’s secure enough that no one could ever guess it

Well you and I won’t be around to find out so I wouldn’t worry about it too much. Considering it’s over 100 years away we might not even still be using bitcoin that deep into the future, maybe everything is automated and we have no use for money whatsoever. 
All that being said when we hit 21 million then the network runs on fees. In all honesty who knows what the price would be, we could use bitcoin entirely and things will be priced in BTC or maybe fiats still around, it’s impossible to say. 
We’ll likely have enough production and technology in the world that you’ll just be able to walk in the grocery store and grab whatever you want, electricity will likely be free and entirely produced via renewable energy, cars will likely be autonomous, jobs will likely be optional. 
In 2140 bitcoin will be celebrated and looked at as something that helped significantly usher in the future, but it will probably just be a novelty that grandpa got rich off of at that point

No it won't, it's not possible. The halving is what restricts the supply in real-time and is what drives the prices up.

Segwit helped, most clients are segwit compatible and lightning is gaining traction

The fact of the matter is you can never price the halving in until it happens, that's the beauty of it. 
There are only two driving forces behind the price of bitcoin, buyers and sellers. The biggest sellers are people who are actively mining the coin, they need to sell in order to keep the lights on. As soon as the halving happens they're getting less bitcoin then they once did before and this restricts the supply, given that at the time of the halving you generally have a steady stream of buyers (people who believe in bitcoin and are steadily buying it) this is what drives the price up initially, then the masses catch on again and the price moons. Rinse and repeat.

There’s no way that’s true, I’m too lazy to look it up but more than baseball? Football? No way

That first one was just an assumption, if you woke up one day and your entire stash was gone from some shady company the first thing I’d do is try to reestablish my position, probably not the real cause of the bull run but I’d say it’s a factor. 
And yeah man we gotta hit the halving before we can achieve historic highs again, there’s too much supply from miners at the moment. Mark my word we won’t go anywhere near 20K for another year and a half

It’s all relative and as long as governments continue printing money there’s theoretically an unlimited supply of it. I’ve never once cared how much I’m getting for my dollar amount, I just buy more. 
Bitcoin is also obviously a global currency, there’s no way to reliably know how much fiat other countries are sitting on. Saudi Arabia is sitting on trillions of dollars just in oil money.

The rise of bitcoin recently is due to the binance hack. Hear me out and rather than downvote, let’s discuss 
7000 bitcoins representing over $40,000,0000 dollars were moved to wallets that can’t be touched without suspicion. That’s 7000 odd bitcoin removed from hot wallets that were actively buying/selling 
Of the people who’s coins were stolen, many probably re-bought for fear of missing out. So now you have added demand along with a newly restricted supply (those 7000 BTC can’t be sold without suspicion) 
People see the price skyrocket and FOMO buy more than usual, all of these factors are compounding 
This bull run won’t last long - we’re still a year or so away from the halving and then we moon not long after that.
