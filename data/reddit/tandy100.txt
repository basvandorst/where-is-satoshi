blockchain wallets are a weak link

Why aren't you all posting in the comments??
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:56:34
I am so glad you are curious and asked so many questions. Now read the faq on the sidebar.

Your math is missing some definitions there. If I loan 1 btc at 10% I get 1.1 btc back. Why do I have to lend at -10%??
Edit: I see what your saying. Wording is confusing. So why would someone borrow at 30%
Because they have a good idea? Some people do that now. Or see "payday loans"

It's gone down like ten times already. Why'd you wait?

Hmm. A lot of currencies are collapsing lately. Cyprus, Thailand, Ukraine, Argentina... perfect storm?

@_date: 2013-12-03 03:16:55

@_date: 2013-12-03 03:03:49
I like it!

Coinbase or bitpay has merchant services.
I just emailed the oil minister of Iran about bitcoins. 
India is next.

What are your payment options now?
I'd say take it straight to your merchants. See if it would save them money and if they would be interested. If you have enough of them ask your boss for you then its done. Always remember who the real bosses are.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:06:22
Yes. im going to be a dick about it.

What would happen if the USD crashed from $10/btc to $1000000/btc?
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:13:43
I like you.

I agree with your point and see what you are saying but when you give that dollar to the bank you are receiving someone else's debt in return. In the form of bonds, securities, etc. They give you a cut of the interest. But make no mistake every dollar everyone has is in loan by the fed. You have $100k? The fed is loaning it to you.
How? National debt is more per person than we can pay. The fed wants that 100k back from you? Inflate so its worth 70k. You have no say. It is their money. Who's name is on it? You have gold, land? You own it. Gov can take their cut. Fed borrows that cut for free to give to people for dollars. When $ was backed by gold we didn't have as high of a tax on some things.

and it better involve a sharpie

Ughhhhh, this is the best part. I would have sold at 1050 and bought in at 930 if I wasn't at work and signed up for an exchange. 
This has been like clockwork every time. Never fails. 
It will do this some more then recover
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:35:51
I cannot wait to be one of them!

Guns and fireworks! America! F yeah

Money was backed by gold. Today it is backed by debt.
And inflationary debt is why fiat collapses long term. They could always start over.
But that would be put commerce in the dark ages of price discovery, so gold would be best.
What is Mongolian currency worth to you or Euro Disney bucks?
Is it as valuable to you as everyone else?

What do they think and what did the radio say?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:23:38
There are floating interest loans in the world. Borrower and lender agree on 1% return then use some standard publication of deflation % to calculate that 1%.
It's done now in contracts paid in other currencies.
