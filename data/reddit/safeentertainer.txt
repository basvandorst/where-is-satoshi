BTC won't worth much whales will have 90% of it lol.

A bit like when you're the king on a poker table, you'll eat every other folks because you're stack is so high

what's the point? making only a few hundreds buck of benefit? you won't get rich with small amount. Will have a better investment investing on yourself, doing some web work that bring passive incomes
