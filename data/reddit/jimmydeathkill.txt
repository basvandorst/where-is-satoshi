I like Celsius Network been good as gold so far and quick withdraws for when you need to

Haha well worth scolling all the way down to see this ����
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:53:23
Exactly this.
The amount of people that sell thinking it will drop and buy in at a higher price is crazy. Yeah if you time it right you can get slightly more but the risk factor is far to high for the small reward.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:11:54
What price did you buy at?
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:03:00
Well if you in the green nice and if you are not you eventually will be. Best investment for the current generation in my opinion.

Just hold dude there loads of information online.

Well said, accumulation is key buy prices which you think it is fair and wait till your see your exit price. With BTC I think I will just hold what I have and not sell any time soon. 
With the amount being capped I think each time we see a huge drop it will never reach the last previous low.

Good average mate, this is also the mindset that I  have adopted 
I got burnt with xrp and bought all the way down to a healthy average to recover and happy with the amount I have now. Going forward with investing I am bullish on BTC and think buying what ever amount you are happy with per week month is the way forward. I'm happy to hold for the next 5-10 years. Our generations pention pot

Get vegeta memes ready everyone.

A lot do this already
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:23:13
I bought at 5,000 I think it won't drop below 10,000 now but if it does will top up some more I don't have a great deal in the bag at the moment but can see it reaching crazy heights this time round.

I wish got a 5k one though ��
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:20:47
Probably didn't explain the last comment as I meant. For Bitcoin it will never reach the same lows again so yes completely agree with what you are saying

Mate this is a cool chart ✌
@_date: 2019-09-15 16:36:51
Got any more of those blue eyes white dragons..
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:20:43
This is awesome
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:27:42
How clever are you this sounds like some James Bond stuff. I would have just buried it somewhere.
 Kudos to you sir.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:36:58
Lol exact same

Uphold is decent as can use debit card and is instant SEPA can vary in time for deposits. You can't withdraw within 24 hours but this is still sooner than if you used SEPA anyway.

Just hide in a cave, in a lake or something

Seen a few posts about having this info in their wills now. Imaging saving all that coinage for your family and for it to just get forgotten.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:17:18
Exactly this
