Bitcoin's price went up from $800 USD to $20k USD in the last year for no logical reason whatsoever (it actually became far less usable as a currency). Why do you expect a logical reason for it dropping from $20k to $15k? I wouldn't be surprised if it dropped all the way back to $800. All the people that bought it over the last year are gamblers who don't know anything about the technology and just want to get rich. As soon as they realize their mistake, it will crash back toward it's long run value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:13:00
It was $20k five days ago, so $15k is nowhere near the worst time. Be happy that you weren't able to buy earlier in the week.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:30
Can you explain why? I went through a lot of effort to sell most of my cryptocurrency over the last month when it became obvious that it was in a bubble. The absurdly high fees required to transfer bitcoin to an exchange clearly show it's no longer remotely viable as a currency. I can't imagine why anyone would want to throw more money in to it. The 25X gains in one year was certainly nice for me, but it's just baffling why anyone would want to buy at the top into a currency that no longer has any functionality as a currency. 
I would also never put $15k in something as volatile as crytptocurrency unless my total portfolio was at least $1.5 million. You should allocate no more than a couple percent of your portfolio to "play money" and the rest to real investments.

In the case of bitcoin, your break even price is the price that you paid for it plus any fees. The phrase "reduce your break even price" doesn't make any sense.

I've never heard of a credit card that awful (effectively 6% fee). Most credit cards use the Mastercard rate or something similar. You need to check before you apply for a credit card to make sure it isn't a scam like that.
6% is terrible even for a currency exchange booth. Airport money changers are sometimes that awful, but normal money changers in cities usually charge a lot less. Major cities like Hong Kong with a lot of competition often have spreads under 1%. Never change money in an airport is one of those things you learn after you've traveled a bit.

Why do you think that? Do you understand how prices work? It's supply and demand. There is no logical reason why changes in supply and demand would follow any of the indicator patterns you are tracking. 
A large portion of the buy and sell orders are placed by bots using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are specifically trained to maximize the return for the people that own the bots, not the clueless daytraders they are making the money from. Many of the people with the trading bots are using large amounts of money, which means they can actually move the markets, unlike you. These traders are called "whales". Anyone who denies their existance is an idiot, because it's very easy to see how much BTC they have in their wallets and when they trade since it's in the public blockchain. You can also clearly see the vertical lines in the price charts when a whale decides to move the price enough to cause margin calls for all the idiot daytraders using leverage.
Do you even understand that day trading is a zero sum game. The only way a day trader makes money is by outsmarting or outguessing other day traders. Give the extremely primitive trading strategy you are using, it's obvious you are one of the traders who is providing profits for the smarter day traders using more sophisticated algorithms and more market power.

That's not how businesses work. They need to quickly convert their revenue into the currency they pay their bills in. If your employees are paid in Yen and your rent is in Yen, you immediately convert all of the payments from your customers into Yen regardless of whether they are paying in USD or EUR or BTC. Currency fluctuations are a completely unnecessary risk. The only way to make BTC work as a currency is to make it very easy for merchants to accept it and immediately convert it in to whatever currency they need without any currency fluctuation risk.

Most people only have a few hundred dollars of paper money at most, and keep the rest in banks. If someone steals all the cash in my wallet, my net worth declines by 0.1% at most. If people used bitcoin wallets like normal wallets (a place to keep small amounts of money to buy lunch and beer) instead of trying to use it to replace savings accounts, we wouldn't have all these problems with people getting hacked. Storing a large portion of your savings with some easily hackable string of digits is just as ridiculous as carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in paper money.
Of course, that destroys the new "store of value" narrative. Bitcoin is not a replacement for a savings account, and it's definitely not a replacement for real investments like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. It's only a potential substitute for small amounts of paper money you carry in your pocket, and so far it's a very poor substitute given that 99.9% of merchants won't accept it.

No, you should always choose to pay in local currency, never USD. They will charge an enormous conversion fee that is much higher than any credit card. I don't think many people still fall for that scam. Now that you know, you won't fall for it any more either. I'm American, but I spend 11 months a year overseas, so I'm very familiar with all of the transaction fees.


Banks that charge that much are making a ton of profit off of you. It costs the banks a fraction of a percent to actually convert the currency. Credit and debit cards that offer no transaction fees lose a tiny bit of money on the conversion, but usually make up for it with merchant fees.
If you want to move money between a USD bank account and a EUR bank account, use Tranferwise which charges less than 1%.


FX spreads that less than 0.1%. That's not a justification to pay a merchant 5% to convert USD to EUR or credit cards charging 3%. They charge those high fees because some people are gullible enough to pay them. It's the same reason bitcoin ATMs charge 10% transaction fees, to profit off of suckers.


It's extremely obvious that the USD amount is nowhere close to the actual amount. Why would you ever consider paying such an absurd fee?

Gold has value because there is a very limited supply of metal with similar properties to gold. The periodic table of elements isn't going to change, so we know that no other elements will suddenly become as good or better than gold. There are an infinite number of possible crypto-currencies, so there is no reason any of them would have any intrinsic value unless they actually do something valuable. It's also pretty easy to buy actual digital gold if that's what you really want. 
Gold is also not very good for wealth preservation. Gold is highly volatile like stocks, but returns over time are essentially zero. Someone that just put their money in a normal savings account in any major fiat currency would do a much better job preserving their wealth. Stocks, bonds, and real estate are also better in almost every possible way. 


So you've mostly given up on the original purpose of bitcoin? Credit card fees are often 2-3%, so it's not hard for a cryptocurrency to compete. It's really only bitcoin that is currently too slow and expensive to possibly compete. A bigger use is competing with remittance services like Western Union rather than competing with Visa.

My understanding is that the current rate adds 52 GB to the block chain per year., which is currently at 130 GB. Increasing the transaction rate to 2000 tx/sec would add over 17 TB per year to the block chain. 8 TB hard drives on Amazon cost $180, so it would cost less than $400 to store a year worth of transactions. If the cost per TB continues to halve every 2 years, we should expect that 17 TB storage cost to drop to $12 in ten years and 40 cents in 20 years. Visa's transactions should increase in line with global economic growth at around 4% per year, which is tiny compared to the 40% increase allowed by Moore's law.
Lightning network makes sense, but I don't think blockchain space needs to become that expensive either.

You can buy things with it now. Some things can be purchased using bitcoin and some things can't. The same is true of dollars and Euro and Yen and every other currency.

People trade normal currencies too, so bitcoin becoming a normal currency isn't going to stop people from trading it.

By investors, you mean people speculating on the price of cryptocurrencies? The purpose of cryptocurrencyies isn't to make it easy for speculators to make money. Most speculators will buy the wrong cryptocurrencies at the wrong time and lose money. The same is true of most investments in early stage startups, most people trading fiat currencies on the FX markets, most people day tradings penny stocks, most people playing slot machines, etc. The important thing for speculators to understand is that their favorite cryptocurrencies could drop 80% or more at any time, so never invest any money in it that you can't afford to lose.

Internet speeds could be a problem, but that will presumably continue to increase over time.


Experts at what? Most decent jobs require real computers, not just tablets or phones. Most people now do at least some work remotely, so you need real computers at home. Laptops are cheap enough that most people in relatively developed countries will have one at home. PC sales are down to only 270 million units per year because most people wait 5 years to replace them instead of 3 years. That still means around a billion people own PCs, which is far more than enough to run a distributed network.


I honestly can't imagine living like that? What are you using to type your comments here? A smart phone? Even if 90% of the population is like you, that still leaves 700 million people that use real computers, which is plenty to run the block chain.

People making extremely speculative investments have no expectation of being sure about anything,

That's what you did. You bought at the peak of the bubble when the price was absurdly high. You not only gambled money you couldn't afford to gamble, but you gambled it after the price went up 2500% in one year for no reason. Assets that go up that quickly always crash hard. The current 70% drop was inevitable and is probably just the beginning of the crash.


The price in 10:15 years will probably be lower than it is now, and definitely be far lower than the 2017 bubble peak. Why do you think it would continue to go up? The technology isn't any better than when the price was under $1k, the number of merchants accepting it is far lower, and there is more competition. There is no logical reason why the price went above $1k and no reason why it couldn't drop back down.

That's not remotely true. I've used the US dollar a lot in Latin America and a few parts of Southeast Asia like Vietnam and Cambodia, but most countries aren't like that. Almost no one will take US dollars in Europe or East Asia, especially China.


Try using US dollars at a 3 star hotel in the Eurozone next time, or any restaurant or attraction that caters to middle class tourists. 5 star hotels are not remotely representative of the travel industry. 
The five star hotels are willing to go through the hassle of currency conversion because you are paying them an absurd amount of money. They are probably also giving you a shitty exchange rate. You would probably be better off walking across the street to the nearest bank and exchange it yourself.
The US dollar is the most popular currency in the world. A better comparison to bitcoin would be a smaller currency like Vietnames Dong. Try using Vietnamese Dong at your favorite 5 star hotel in Paris.

Banks are a million times safer than bitcoin. In the last few months, tons of people have lost everything when exchanges get hacked or their passwords get compromised. I don't lose a penny if my bank gets hacked. When I lost my bank password, I just reset it. In the last 6 months, my bank account gained 1% during the time that bitcoin lost 70%.

Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system. It is supposed to be a substitute for services like Visa and Mastercard. When companies say, "we accept bitcoin, it means their payment processor can accept payments through bitcoin's decentralized payment system. It doesn't mean that they have a wallet to store the currency.


The advantage of being able to process more currencies and payment systems is being able to attract more customers. What is the advantage of your alternative system? Why would a company in Japan that does all their business in Yen want to accept money in bitcoin that isn't immediately converted to Yen. It adds a ton of extra hassle, security problems, currency fluctuation risk, etc, and provides no value to the company.


The markets decided that US dollars, Euros, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and UK pounds are the most important currencies. Why deal with tiny insignificant currencies like BTC at all? It's much more hassle and security risk than fiat and far less used. The merchants that give up on coinbase stop accepting crypto payments entirely. They don't decide to set up their own wallets.

Have you ever traveled in your life? Go to any hotel or restaurant or tourist attraction catering to foreign tourists and try to pay them in US dollars or any other foreign currency.

You can use any timeframe to measure volatility or inflation/deflation. It's customary to report inflation on a monthly basis.
Bitcoin lost over 2/3 of it's value in 6 months. That's 200% inflation in 6 months or 800% annualized inflation. None of the major fiat currencies have had anything like that. If more countries have Venezuela like inflation, it just increases demand for the 100+ responsibly managed fiat currencies.

Both views are invalid because they are just random guesses, but dropping to $4k is obviously far more plausible. That's just a 42 % price move, which is obviously far more likely than the 200% price move you need to get to an ATH.


A bear market is a 20% price drop from the high. Bitcoin is 65% down, so it's deep in to the bear market. 


We're only a few hundred dollars above the February lows, but $13k below the December highs


The current price on June 11 is far lower than the May low and the lowest point in 2 months. March was the only month where the low was higher than the previous month. 


That's an absurd belief.


There is no reason to think it will go up next year. It's down over 60% in less than 6 months. It may recover some of the losses over the next few years, but it's more likely that it will keep moving down or move sideways. 
Bitcoin fans love to compare bitcoin to gold. However, gold has also gone through many long bear markets and it's long term return is terrible. Gold prices peaked at $1895 per ounce in 2011, and there is no evidence that will get anywhere close to that high again any time soon.

No, you can use the pre-paid gift cards to buy stuff in the store. That means the store treats the gift cards like money but does not treat bitcoin as money. The bitcoin machine is purely for gambling. You put real money in the machine to gamble with and then take real money out when you cash out. That's why the emphasize the buying and selling of bitcoin. You don't need to sell your gift cards back for fiat because gift cards are a form of money that you can use to buy goods.


Bitcoin isn't like a bank account at all. It can't be used to buy things like a card that you get from your bank. It isn't a way of saving money because the value fluctuates wildly and just dropped 70% in the last 6 months. The bitcoin ATM has insanely high fees so you would lose tons of money even if bitcoin was relatively stable.
Encouraging poor people that don't even have a bank account to gamble is just awful. They already lose tons of money buying lottery tickets. Bitcoin is essentially treated as a lottery now, where people are wasting lots of money in the hopes that the price will suddenly moon by going up 20X again.

It's not a literal pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme. It's an asset bubble, which is like a decentralized ponzi scheme. My point is that bitcoin forms a pyramid shape. The only way for anyone to make money is for another much larger layer of bagholders to join and form the new bottom of the pyramid.
The people at the top that made 2000% gains are a very small minority because all of their gains have to come from new investors that bought in at much higher prices. Bitcoin is a negative sum game, so every dollar someone makes from bitcoin comes from other people that lost money on bitcoin. That means each person that makes a lot of money must be balanced out by a much larger number of people that lost money.

If Coinbase and Bitpay are so bad, why has no one developed anything better? You are grossly underestimating how difficult payment processing is.
Merchants need to receive payments in the currency that they do business in. When I book a hotel online, the payment processor converts my US dollars to Euros or Yen in a few seconds, then sends it to the merchant. Japanese hotels have no interest in accepting US dollars or any other currency that isn't Yen because it creates lots of unnecessary hassle and currency risk. It is the job of the payment proccessor to do the conversion, not the merchant.
When I need a refund, the payment processor does the same conversion in reverse from Yen to dollars in a few seconds.

I just explained how no one here cares about the fact that this store does not use the technology at all. The bitcoin ATM is sitting in the middle of the store surrounded by things that are purchased with money, yet the owners do not accept bitcoin because they don't think it's money. If anyone here cared about the technology, they would be complaining about the fact that you can't actually use the bitcoin in the store instead of talking about how great it is that you can gamble with bitcoin while using your real money (fiat) to buy coke and newspapers.
Currency speculation isn't investing, so it wouldn't be investing even if it was a real currency.
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:14:56


The merchant is in Japan and does business in Yen. You can't use the bitcoin protocol to send Yen. If you don't want to send them Yen, you have to use a third party that can convert your currency to Yen. Why is this difficult to understand?


If the camera is priced in Yen, the refund is in Yen. If I pay them with my US credit card, the merchant doesn't hold US dollars in case I want a refund. The merchant sends the Yen back to my credit card, and my credit card converts it to dollars. I often receive a few percent more or less back in US dollars because of fluctuations in the exchange rate. If they won't hold hold on to my US dollars to wait for a refund, why would they do that for a a far more obscure and volatile currency like bitcoin? 


I handle lots of different currencies. I sometimes have 5 different fiat currencies in my wallet at the same time. It's very easy for customers to handle lots of currencies, but much more difficult for merchants. 
Merchants are the ones setting the prices, and they set the prices in one currency. Calculating the exchange rates in a zillion different currencies is a huge hassle. Converting between currencies themselves is a hassle. Price fluctuations creates lots of unnecessary risk. Accepting more currencies makes everything less secure because they have to store them all securely and guard against fraud.
If all merchants decide to take 2 or 3 or 10 currencies, how do they pick which ones? They are never going to be able to please all their customers. There are 180 government fiat currencies, 1600 cryptocurrencies, and a nearly infinite amount of branded currencies like airline rewards points.

When investors get risk averse, they dump risky bets. That's why bitcoin went up so much in 2017 when risky sticks around the world were skyrocketing, and crashed in 2018 when investors rushed for safety. If we get a real bear market in stocks, bitcoin could drop back below $1k.

I've lived through many asset bubbles and will live through many more. Today's bitcoin investors are many of the same people that were buying lots of gold at the top of the bubble in 2011, and of course gold prices have not recovered from that crash. The Nasdaq took over 15 years to recover from the 1999 bubble, and most dot com stocks never recovered. The Japanese stock market is still way below the peak from the 1980s, and the Chinese stock market went through many bubbles and crashes as recently as 2015. I owned lots of baseball cards during the 1980s-90s price bubble, but they are mostly worthless now. Antique furniture went through a bubble in the 1990s and is now down 80%. In the late 90s, there was also the famous beanie baby bubble and crash. Housing prices in many parts of the US, Spain, and many other countries still hasn't recovered from the bubble that peaked in 2006.


I bought bitcoin in 2014 and 2016 and sold 90% of it in November-December 2017. I made about two thousand percent profit.
Prices of several hundred dollars per bitoin makes perfect sense. It's a reasonable way to make international transactions over the internet. However, it can only handle a maximum of about 7 transactions per second, so it can never be used by more than a few million people. When bitcoin's market cap went above companies like paypal or Visa which can handle hundreds of times as many payments, it was obvious that it was in a crazy bubble. 


The vast vast majority of hedge funds do not invest any money in bitcoin because they know it's in a bubble. The only people who claim that bitcoin will go up are people who make big commissions from shilling their bitcoin hedge funds. Finance experts and economists mostly agree that bitcoin is still in a bubble.

Bitcoin needs some massive technological breakthroughs to be usable. Fees shoot up to $50 whenever transaction rates reach a fraction of a percent of a major credit card. It uses hundreds of thousands of times more energy per transaction than any other financial system. Solving either of those problems will require technology that currently does not exist. Once that happens, bitcoin could become a real payment system that works at scale. I don't think it would become popular, but it would at least become possible.

Astrology is well established too, but it also has no predictive power. I know what TA is, which is why I know it's a scam. You don't need to keep trying to explain it to me.


Don't forget about high frequency trading. That's similar to TA in that it's primarily based on price movements rather than fundamentals, but it actually works and is used by real traders because it's based on finding patterns from data rather than chart astrology. 


Why do you think all the TA gurus spend all their time writing books and selling their methods instead of just making money using them? Could the scam be any more obvious?


Is that a typo? Hedge funds obviously love high volume.


Almost every successful investor understand TA, just like every successful astronomer understands astrology. That's how they know that it's bullshit.

That's the way the world has always worked and always will work. Cryptocurrency does not change that fact at all. Why should anyone be entitled to an investment with no risk and no cost? The safest option for that now is TIPS (inflation protected treasury bonds), but you still can end up with a return below zero.


Cryptocurrencies are deflationary, which makes them highly unstable in value. When gold was used as currency, there were periodic booms with inflation followed by busts with high deflation. The value of cryptocurrency is their potential as a medium of exchange, not as a store of value. Hodling will always be a form of speculation.

When you put savings into a bank, that money is loaned to other people. The savings and the loans are the same money.

Almost all of the most successful businesses in the US got money from outside investors, not just from the founder's savings. You want to shut down the system responsible for almost all of the wealth and prosperity in America.

Deflation doesn't neccessarily kill our economy, but people here are talking about bitcoin going up in price by another 10 thousand percent over the next decade or two, which is an absurdly high rate of hyper-deflation.
Having unstable deflationary currencies like gold that go through periods of high deflation followed by periods of inflation obviously doesn't destroy the economy, because we lived through that at many points in history. The modern fiat currency system with much more stable prices is much better though.


For the vast majority of businesses, you need to borrow money to start your business. How can I borrow bitcoin to open my business, when the value of bitcoin keeps going up every year? I borrow 100 bitcoin to open a restaurant where meals cost 3 mili-bitcoin. The next year as bitcoin continues to soar in value, I have to cut the price to 2 mili-bitcoin, then a few years later to 1 mili-bitcoin. Even though my restaurant is successful, my debt keeps soaring. People loaning money in bitcoin will obviously assume this would happen, so they would never loan me money for my restaurant in the first place. With a currency that deflationary, no one can but the rich can start a business, no one can but the rich can buy a house, no one but the rich can can pay for an education. 
When we had the gold standard, similar things did happen. The rich bankers on the east coast made tons of money while the poor farmers in the rest of the country got deeper and deeper in debt. Since they borrowed money in a deflationary gold backed currency, it was almost impossible for them to pay back their loans. That is why there was a big political movement in the 1890s to get rid of the gold standard. The rich bankers obviously loved the gold standard, so they were able to crush the working class people trying to abolish it.

That's literally the complete opposite of how it works. The way to stop being a wage slave is to get an education or start a business.

It's a basic fact of how people live in countries that still don't have access to capital.

There is no way that anyone could have built Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc, with their own savings.

That doesn't mean they didn't borrow money. They all founded their companies on borrowed money. All of those companies still borrow lots of money. The fact they were started in a garage has absolutely nothing to do with the discussion about savings and borrowing. All of those companies were founded with borrowing as well as savings.

Completely irrelevant. They all needed borrowed money. None of those companies could exist under your economic system.

Did you ever look at the actual paper?


but not with elastic supply and a finite number of potential homebuyers. 
So they clearly did not make an assumption that it was fixed, but instead consider the fact that it's somewhat elastic


bubbles written by financial and monetary economists has assumed that the supply of assets is
either fixed or determined by a monetary authority. While this assumption is appropriate for
some markets, **it is not for housing markets, where new homes regularly are built in response
to rising prices**. 
Here they are very clearly saying the assumption of fixed supply can not be used for housing markets
So essentially you went to google and found a paper that says the exact opposite of what you claimed, and the paper actually agrees with me completely. Yet I'm somehow the one out of my depth.

Those tax cuts and military spending will also add many trillions of dollars to the debt.

Prices would only fall significantly in parts of the country where land is really expensive (LA, SF, NYC, DC, Boston, etc). The cost of building materials wouldn't fall because those are commodities. The price of labor for construction workers may fall a bit, but that isn't really a good thing. The price of land in middle america is basically zero, so that can't fall much. A working class person in Ohio that wanted a $150k house would be completely screwed because they wouldn't be able to afford it until they were 60. A wealthy San Franciscan that wanted to buy a $2 million mansion in cash would be in great luck, because the price would probably drop a lot.
You also don't need to imagine a world without access to mortgages, because that is how most of the developing world works. You end up with a large portion of the population living in slums. Access to capital is the main difference between rich countries and poor countries.


The assumption is very wrong, so it's a bit silly to have an argument where we start by falsely assuming you are right. We build millions of homes every year, and the money to pay for the construction material and the wages for the construction workers mostly comes from borrowed money.


We already have gold. The market cap of gold is currently 100 times higher than bitcoin. Gold is widely used as a reserve currency and as a hedge against inflation. The Yen has also been mostly deflationary for decades, and is widely used as a reserve currency and hedge against economic risk.

Fiat is functional because it is a great medium of exchange. No one is forcing you to store your wealth in fiat, so you can't cry "theft" when an asset that promises to target a 2% inflation rate meets it's target. You are free to store your wealth in gold, real estate, stocks, other commodities, crypto-currencies, art work, pogs, beanie babies, etc. However, the value of all those things is very volatile with daily swings in value of several percent or more. The 2% inflation rate is a price you can voluntarily pay for stability.

No one uses bitcoin as a measure of value. Even places that accept bitcoin for payments use a fiat currency to measure the value of the bitcoin. No one prices things in but coin, which means it isn't a measure of value.

which was highly unstable in value as I literally just explained in the comment you replied to. Look at charts of the price of gold, or look at the levels of inflation and deflation when the gold standard was in effect. We were experiencing economic panics and depressions regularly until we finally killed the gold standard.


No, it doesn't. If you put your fiat money in a standard high yield savings account or government bonds over the last 27 years, your money would grow faster than inflation.


No. The price of goods and services has dropped 90% in a year when valued in bitcoin, so that's 90% deflation. Bitcoin goes through bursts of rapid inflation and rapid deflation because it is inherently unstable in value. Unless there is some mechanism to increase and decrease the money supply in response to economic conditions, there will always be cycles of high inflation and high deflation.

The price is calculated in one currency and then converted to the others using the current floating exchange rate. Some things are calculated in dollars, some in euros or pounds of yen depending on what airline or hotel you are booking. You can see the USD or Bitcoin equivalent of the cost of your Japanese hotel room, but it's really in Yen. Expedia will do the conversion for you with a built in conversion fee. The diffence between bitcoin and the real currencies on Expedia is that bitcoin is not the base currency for anything. You are really doing 2 transactions, selling your BTC for Yen, and then buying the room in Yen.

If the price of bitcoin goes up two thousand percent like in 2017, the borrower just has to declare bankruptcy and the lender can never get their but coin back. If the price of bitcoin drops 70% like 2018 or 2014, the lender is paid back with far less money than they loaned out. 
In order to have a real economy where people can borrow money to start businesses and buy homes, you need a stable currency. If the bitcoin you borrowed to buy your house is suddenly worth 10 times as much as your house, you will never be able to pay off the debt.

I was mainly talking about mobile payment systems around the world, and especially China, that are debit transactions without any credit card company involvement or credit card fees. The US system is definitely not as good and still rarely used. 
Even then, bitcoin hacks are far more common than credit card hacks, so the idea that bitcoin is more secure is rather absurd. When was the last time you heard about someone losing all their money because they accidentally downloaded a hacked version of Android pay? You have to trust every line of code in the bitcoin wallet app you are using, so you need to trust them far more than your mobile payment app. If your phone is stolen, you can just freeze your fiat payment apps without losing a dime, but your bitcoin wallet is stuck on the stolen phone.
The bitcoin payment system can't work without the lightning network, which still does not work at scale.


That also means consumers have zero recourse when there is fraud. You need to have complete trust in the merchant since you have no way to cancel the transaction if they don't deliver. If you are robbed or hacked, you can cancel all your fiat transactions, but the bitcoin transactions are irreversible.

Can you give any examples of a business that actually prices their goods or services in bitcoin? People that accept bitcoin always price their goods and services in fiat. For example, a bar that sells a beer for $5 and allows you to pay $5 worth of bitcoin is not actually pricing anything in bitcoin. They are just allowing you to barter, but using dollars as the measure of value.

Where did you get that definition from? Did you find a real definition and then swap the AND for OR? It has to be a means of exchange, unit of account, and a store of value.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:06:29
The first words of your definition are "generally accepted", not "could" or "the ability to". Bitcoin is not generally accepted as a measure of value by anyone. The only reason people buy it is because they expect the value to increase, which means they know it isn't what you use to measure value.
Some idiot could price his goods in bitcoin, but they would have to change the price every few minutes because the value changes constantly.  


Gold is a commodity. You can compare the relative value of any commodities like one barrel of oil is worth x bushels of soy beans. Does that mean soy beans or oil are a unit of account? You can do the same with consumer goods. One gallon of milk is worth 2.87 cans on Budweiser. Does that mean milk or beer are money? Money is something generally accepted as a unit of account, not something that theoretically could be used that way.


They were money because they were used as a measure of value. Then they stopped using them as a measure of value, so they stopped being money. Your argument is essentially that everything could be money, therefore everything is money.

Every scam seems to be functioning fine until the people being scammed realize they can't get their money back.


How is that different from the stupidity of all the people that stored bitcoin on BTC-E? Since all those people already deserved to lose all their money for being stupid enough to use BTC-E, what's wrong governments taking the money?


Vinnick broke laws in the US and many other countries, and his victims asked their governments to prosecute him. European governments also involved in the investigation, so there is no need to single out the US. The Greek government are the ones that actually arrested him. There is nothing magical about bitcoin that exempts crimes committed with bitcoin from normal laws. Crimes involving multiple countries isn't a new idea.

I already repeatedly explained to you that the only way to know if it's insolvent is if there are a huge request for withdrawals at the same time. The US banking system was functioning fine in 2008 until it collapsed. Everything is functioning fine until it collapses. The evidence for BTC-e being insolvent is the fact that guy running it looted the last bitcoin exchange he was involved in until it was insolvent, and has now been arrested and had this exchange shut down. There is no evidence that BTC-e was solvent other than wishful thinking about wanting to blame governments for everythin.

That is true. It is a very good thing to discourage people from just hoarding cash, because that is bad for the economy. We want people to spend their money on goods and services or invest their money in businesses or other infrastructure, because both of those things create jobs and help grow the economy. Hoarding currency takes the currency out of the economy and causes deflation, which is what happened during recessions when we were on the gold standard including the Great Depression.


I agree that it is bad if your wages don't increase as fast as inflation. However, a period of deflation where your wages decrease faster than prices decrease is even worse. If you get a 20% pay cut every year but the price of goods and services only decrease by 10% a year, your standard of living drops rapidly. Even worse, your mortgage stays the same since it is in nominal dollars, so you are soon completely unable to pay your mortgage and lose your house or farm or business. Again, these things happened during recessions when we had the gold standard.


All banking is fractional reserve banking, so the term "fractional reserve" is redundant. I assume you are alluding to "full reserve banking", a hypothetical form of banking that has never existed in the real world. Money lenders have been using a form of fractional reserve banking for at least 4 thousand years. Modern fractional reserve banks have been around since the 1300s. The concept of a "middle class" originated in the 1700s, so there has never been a middle class without fractional reserve banking.


Inflation does allow governments to have slightly higher spending or slightly lower taxes than they would otherwise. However, your theory that the Iraq war wouldn't have happened without it is ridiculous. Do you really think that countries with deflationary currencies fight less wars? You really need to study some history. Much of the world used gold and silver as currencies during the 1700s through 1930s, and their was still lots and lots of wars.


Have you ever heard of the British Empire? It was quite powerful in the 1800s when Britain conquered 1/3 of the world while they used deflationary metals as currency.

The credit card market is thousands of times bigger than all of the bitcoin markets combined, so thefts of this scale are tiny in the overall scheme of the billions of credit cards in existence.
All of these credit cards will be canceled and their owners will receive a new one in the mail. They'll each spend 30 seconds activating the new card, and replace the stolen/cancelled one in their wallet. It will have no effect on their enjoyment of the day.

I wouldn't recommend using bitcoin as a way to evade taxes. If someone doesn't report any income but still buys lots of stuff, the government will start asking questions. That is the same way that governments catch drug dealers that claim they have no income because they do all their business in cash. The government can still confiscate your house, car, stock investments, etc if you refuse to pay your taxes.


That is completely false. Austerity is MORE government revenue and less government spending. Austerity policies in most European countries includes raising taxes. Money printing has nothing to do with austerity.
Do you seriously think that the purpose of money printing is to "surreptitiously tax savers and wage earners"? I really hope you were joking there.
