Bitcoin = 1
Fiat = -1
Now add -1 to both numbers. 
Bitcoin = 0
Fiat = -2 
Would you rather have 0 or -2
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:07:54
Ooooh good question... perhaps the amount of bitcoin in the channels is actually the amount of transaction that can pass though. For instance I don't think  .0001 bitcoin  will be able to process .2 bitcoins

The USA has been printing money out of thin air for years and is still doing it to this day. Nobody, has a problem using USA money. But now that bitfitnex has discovered a way to print USA out of thin air it suddenly becomes an issue? 
I don't see why?
If anything this is an issue with the people that prints USA money and the people that is printing fake USA money know as USDT. 
Bitcoin was designed to replace them both. Real FIAT money and fake FIAT money, bitcoin replace both.

Once a FIAT system becomes digital without the security of a blockchain it's all over. Oh wait this has already happen!!!
I told you to ask your bank who does PayPal and square bank with because that's how I discovered that all financial systems online how the ability to print USD out of thin air. 
Digital currency without blockchain security is simply  an email telling the bank to send money from one bank to another. If you can tell your bank to send money from the feds bank acount, (which at every giving moment in time has an inifity amount of money ) to another bank account..... explain how that is not creating money out of thin air.....

No... what im trying to say is Fiat and Debt is not real.... however we value the worth of bitcoin using fiat and debt! how is that not an issue?
Also sense fiat and debt is not real, why does it matter if bitcoin is being pumped by tether or even counterfeiter USD when tether and counterfeits is also fake just the same as debt and fiat.... 
I really want to understand what people are afraid of tether and debt being used to pump up the price of bitcoin. becuase the way I see it.... is its all fake dosent matter the source of fake....fake is fake!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:12:42
Thank you for your advice my friend.  However it is my opinion that debt is a flawed system and I will continue to used this flawed system to my advantage. I would certainly agree that is it foolish of me to take action without fully seeing all the possible outcomes in advance.

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:08:35
Its true everything in life is unknown. 
You don't know if you will die tomorrow from a piano falling from the sky or a car accident. 
But if you can understand why we are not in constant fear of dying tomorrow then you can understand why true bitcoin hodlers are not in constant fear, that bitcoin will crash and go to zero tomorrow. we do know for certain that at some point in time we will all die. we just dont know when... likewise we do no that in some point in time bitcoin will go to zero. we just dont know when. I firmly believe that all fiat currency will go to zero before bitcoin does.

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:19:17
The government has the rights and ability to print money at will.
Some people don't have the right but they have the ability to print money at will.
Both of them print money and both of them buy bitcoin. Why would the price of bitcoin drop when someone discovers that some of the bitcoin was purchased with money that was not issued by the government but by a person that counterfeited the government money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:35

Mark 12:14-17
The Governments are the ones that created Fiat dollars cash. so ever time I have Cash i would be happy to give them the portion of their property they want to take from me. Why? because from my understand it belongs to them. However....the Government did  not create bitcoin and it does not belong to them. so do I pay "tax" on bitcoin. the answer is no.

in real life there is only 0 and 1
when you can open your Frigid and the balance of milk in your fridge is -1 then you are right. but when I open my fridge i either have no milk or milk.
that is why bitcoin is closer to reality than fiat. in fiat you can have -1 in bitcoin there is no such thing as -1

I hope I wasnt making any newbs feel bad. my intention was to give advice in a fun way. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:15:08
People are worried that Bitcoin is going to crash once everyone discovers that tether is not backed by USD. The goal of my question is to understand what difference does it make that tether is not back by USD when USD itself is also not back by anything. 
Likewise, if someone is using counterfeit Money to purchase bitcoin, how would that cause the value of bitcoin to go down. Am I right to feel that it does not matter if something is real money or counterfeit money or debt or tetherUSD it all still has value to the person using it. I'm trying to understand why people are worried about that.

you are assuming i even had 5k to begin with.
my account is actually only negative 4995 because the amount of bitcoin i purchased was 5k
I purchased 0.52 bitcoin @ 9500

"when you believe in things you don't understand, you will suffer." - Stevie Wonder 
Fully understand what bitcoin and its competitors are before you agree to any of them. If you don't know what a blockchain is then you can not really have an input on the scaling debate. 
when a person does NOT know how to read code, then that person is actually putting trust and faith in the person that does, not the code. Because that person can lie and tell you what he wants you to believe regardless of what the code actually says.

When you buy Bitcoin on Robinhood, you are not buying Bitcoin.  How do you know? Say you bought 1 bitcoin today for $9,000 and I came to you in person and asked if I can buy that bitcoin from you for $30,000.  You would be happy to take my money because I'm offering so much more than what you bought it for. However,  you wont be able to give me the bitcoin because you never had it in the first place. Robinhood doesn't allow you to send bitcoin to people because Robinhood doesn't actually own any bitcoin.  When you buy bitcoin on Robinhood you are actually buying more like a fake stock of bitcoin.

Bitcoin are on the blockchain. not a hardware wallet. Just like your website is in the internet not the computer.

In December 2016,
I gave 5 people 0.019 bitcoins each for free. And I told them how to use the wallets how to back of seeds. And i told them to watch the price double before the end of next year. At that time 0.019 bitcoin was worth either $10 or $15.
I checked on all 5 of them a last week to tell them there bitcoin should be worth 50bucks now.
Out of the 5 only 2 of them still have there bitcoin safe and secure. The other three "lost there seeds and there cell phone broke" one guy actually sold his cell and said he forgot he even had bitcoins on it. 
I know its there lost but the more i think about it i feel like its my lost to. 0.06BTC is about 180bucks.
So technically i lost 18pbucks giveing shit away free lol

Bitcoin will fail the same way gold has fail. It will fail in the sense that most people in the world are too lazy or unintelligent to know how they are currently being scammed by the status quo that the will not change and adapt a better system.  Once bakkt launches they will have the power to decided the price of bitcoin at will and all volatility to the upside will be erased.

I dont think bitcoin will ever replace fiat because people get dumber every year not smarter. the dumber people are the easier it is to keep them enslaved. It will take a revolution  for bitcoin to replace fiat but that will never happen because people buy bitcoin to get More fiat not to abandon fiat and start a revolution.  that is the issue.

@_date: 2018-06-30 04:48:29
its not theft at all. debt is generated from nothing by banks. 
theft is when you take something from someone else without their knowledge or permission. banks know they are giving away nothing in exchange for your promises to give them something plus interest. So from my point of view really it is the banks that are stealing because they are the ones that give you debt in the first place.

Coinbase can fractional reserve bitcoin as long as the bitcoin remain on exchange. So my question was, Now when people remove the bitcoin from exchange, what options do exchanges have to stay solvent
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:12:18
If all your bitcoin are on Robinhood, then you don't actually own any Bitcoin. You own a derivative that follows the price. 
For example if I offer to buy your bitcoin right now at a price of $20,000 you wont be able to sell me the bitcoin. That's how you know you dont own any bitcoin.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:12:17
I meant "sell" not "see". It was a typo. 
Sometimes when a person sets a limit sell/buy at a price that is ridiculously high or ridiculously low the order actually gets filled a lot sooner than expected because a whale or a person missing types and clears the entire order book regardless of what the price is. This is what usually causes flash crashes or flash spikes.

Honestly it was a lot harder to hold doing bull market than bear market. Because I after you triple your money twice you wanna spend the profits. However this time around I think I'm just going to hold until I never have to "cash out" again.

I would be happy to borrow 9900 in order to purchase 1 Bitcoin. I would be happy to pay $350 a week for 30 weeks to pay off the loan. Why!?! Becuase I am already buying $350 a week worth of bitcoin and according to my math even after 30 weeks I still won't own 1 full bitcoin. Yes it's true the value of my investment is increasing over time but the amount of coin I will ever own is decreasing as well. I rather own more bitcoin than the value of usd of the coin. I have been searching for a lender or a shark for some time and I won't stop until I own 1 bitcoin.

coinbase is not a webwallet. Coinbase is an exchange aka bank for bitcoin. they have control of your bitcoins and give you permission to use them. where as if you have a wallet, you have control of your own keys.
A hardware wallet is better than a webwallet only because its offline so its not able to be attack where as a wallet that is online can

Something is only deflationary when there is something inflationary to go aginsted it. If inflation via infinite fiat never exists then the vaule of deflation wont be a thing.

Yes - quantum computers can destroy current cryptography. 
BUT 
We are so far away from quantum computers.  Quantum computers can only operate in subzero temperature and we dont have the infrastructure to build a stable quantum computer. 
The quantum computer you heard about recently from NASA and Google is not truly a quantum computer but theoretical replica being that it's a regular computer using qubits instead of binary bits. This type of "quantum computer " can not destroy cryptography.

I'm sorry in this case when I mentioned credit I was actually referring to a loan. Or perhaps I should say debt. You see I've been looking to purchase bitcoin with debt for sometime now. And the deeper I look I only keep coming up with places wanting to give me credit for my bitcoin.  But never vice versa lol

I actually think money itself is the defect. Do you think it's possible for a world to exist with no monetary system of any kind? I'm asking, what would it take for that to be possible?

I have no idea, but I am certainly curious about this. 
imagine if everyone was trying to sell something for $3 at one location and at another location the price is posted at $18. Do you think it would be a good idea to buy it at $3 and try to sell it for $18.  its only confusing because its crypto. Think if this was real life and you see everyone posted a power drill for 20 bucks but on ebay for some reason everyone is selling the exact same product for 200bucks. what happens when you buy the drill for 20 bucks you then post it for self for 200 and all of a sudden the original post for 200 is no long up. you are now the only bag holder trying to sell for the high price. 
TLDR: some people might say they wanna buy at high price just to get you to buy at a lower price which is already higher than the real price.

Math doesn't have free will. 
And almost everything in life can be measured. Measured meaning calculated bedore hand and projected in the future.
Therefore, almost everythingin life can be predicted.
Predicted meaning calculated before hand so as to project a future outcome.

Yes I do. I believe its biggest challenge is education. 
My mother lived through a time before credit cards existed and before smart phones.  She used cash or checks at the grocery store. Today most people use credit cards and some people still use cash. But most places you are not allowed to use checks at groceries store. So I can only assume one day when I'm my mother's age and my children are my age the will be using either credit or crypto and they will ask me the same question I asked my mom.
Cash and checks will still exist just like landline phones and fax machines still exist. But what is most commonly used in the future will be decided by that generation. and if you look at that generation now, they certainly give more vaule to virtual goods more than physical goods. So I dont think it will change when they are older

Some people dont like being responsible for there own wealth the prefer the security of the community trusted bank ((even thought that security is an illusion they feel safer in that illusion.))
Some people prefer to follow the ones that know how to read the fine print rather than learn how to read and actually start reading the fine print.

The argument is the same for bitcoin as well as baseball cards. The only difference is the utility and design of bitcoin give it a higher chance of increasing in value than a baseball card. 
The point you are making is the same as the point I'm making in that people should speculate less and learn more, and take action and have conviction on the value of what they are purchasing.

@_date: 2019-09-29 05:27:24
Your investment amount = I 
Spot price time of investment = SP
Spot price time of cash out = CO
amount of BTC owned. = B
I ÷ SP = B
$500 ÷ $8000 = 0.0625 BTC
B x CO = Profit/loss
0.0625 x $7400 = $462.5
If you bought $500 worth of bitcoin when price was $8000 and you sold all your bitcoin when price was $7400, you did not loose $500 you only loss $37.50

The government created the dollar and gives it to the citizens, therefore it belongs to the goverement. That's why we pay taxes in dollars. ((I actually learn that from the bible Matt 22:21))
Becuase the government does not issue bitcoins to us then we should never be obligated to pay taxes in bitcoin.
However since miners are the ones responsible for running the network and helping issue new coins, everytime we pay a fee in a way it's as if we are paying taxes to miners

It was done online using paxful. 
I was especially paranoid becuase I thought that once he gives me the giftcard passcode he would be able to resell the pass code or use it himself. However this is not possible when using start bucks app. I was able to redeem all the passcodes for one big passcode on the Starbucks so now all the other passcodes are consider used and I still have a a balance in the new one.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner had a crazy night

You do have to be careful and have a back of protection plan. Like it was said before, everything goes good at first but with PayPal and some other trades like venmo can easily be reversed. 
Also another really ridiculous arbitrage  spread is this "restaurant.com" giftcards . The reason I would stay away from this one is simply becuase I'm starting to find out most restaurants no longer honor these giftcards becuase they have been loosing money with them. Some do but you'll have to call the restaurant in your area first to find out. Most of the popular chains say no.
