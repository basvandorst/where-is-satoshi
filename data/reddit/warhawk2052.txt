I'm only telling you what my strategy is
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:33:40
There is a high chance. All my transfers have had a high fee. Now I make them as low as possible and use bitcoin transaction accelerators 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:56:09


Not tell anyone you have them
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:28:22


"if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second."
If Bitcoin ever gets there i'll eat my own dick
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:50:36
Which is common for most banks
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:40:55
And become an minority

You can find ATM's on Google Maps, there are about 7 local to me.

Took 203 minutes to confirm.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:14:11
it's mainly about mining 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:59
I payed $2 to send roughly $25 thing is thats as low as the fee can get 100sat/B . We shall see if i ever get my coins 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:19:35
Once they find out of my millions of dollars of GTA V bucks
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:17:55


How did this come to be anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:55:27
To send 1 USD is 11.49 USD
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:47:01
I picked 100 sat/b with a fee of $2.80 ish

Every time i tried adopting a dog they had more strict requirements than getting a driving licenses.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:32:06
You lose your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:19:05
They make it so hard to adopt, yet they want these dogs gone... Even when I already have a happy healthy dog.  They wanted weekly check ups a tour of my house and property, my work hours and more. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:31:36
It's also not that hard to see which terms are searched yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:36:08
And wait days for it to go through? No
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:13:45
I was looking into using NiceHash about a week ago. Lucky i chose not to go with them
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:33:40
Last i checked, it didnt cost me $30 to send $1. Fees are going to cripple crypto 
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:07:36

@_date: 2014-02-06 21:01:18
But this doesnt hurt apple , they already got your money..
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:50:52
I'm so glad I didn't use them.
That is all.
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:22:48
So a modern day ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:55:22
Got to remember Apple, App Store is a service if they don't want something on it then they don't have to let it stay on it. If you don't like it, take your business somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:23:55
Where do you live that you can retire with $10?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:54:24
Good luck
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:05:25


IF they heard stories from years ago when it was cheaper than a mcdonalds burger than yeah
@_date: 2016-02-07 03:57:24
If your bitcoins get stolen is there a way to get them back? With credit they insure you.
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:18:15


It's pretty fun to do also
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:32:12

@_date: 2013-12-07 22:00:05
