1. This news is not presented correctly. This is a civil case which occurred in 2014 and not a fine of OKCoin. 
2. The case originates in 2014 at which time OKCoin had less stringent KYC/AML practices and was found partially to blame for it. 
3.  First order court ruled to have OKCoin bear 80% of the losses. A second level court appeal then ruled in favor to reduce this amount to 40%. 
4. OKCoin and other exchanges in China were involved in this legal matter and all have taken serious steps in China to improve and make more strict our KYC/AML policies. 
5. The criminals in this case have recently been caught by the police authorities, who are now working to recover the losses. 
Broadly speaking, we do not view this action as having any negative repercussions on digital currency developments in China.

Jack had no involvement in the original negotiation of terms for Bitcoin.com. The contracts held by OKCoin were discovered during the recent review of the business agreement with Mr. Roger Ver. There was no reason to suspect Mr. Ver held a different contract than the one held by the company at the time.

Mr. Roger Ver's allegations against OKCoin are blatantly false. Our response:

Thanks for reply.Most okcoin's customer is from China now.There is some comunication problem in the past.I think our new head of international busses will do it better than before.You we see our improment. Okcoin has 150 employees,there are some guys join and leaves every month,but the core startup team is never changed after Okcoin is founded.

The key problem for cold storage is absolutely cold.multi-sig is not safe enough if the private keys touch internat or usb drive.we use AES password for double check ,which is same with multi-sig but easy to use.Multi-sig is helpful for hot wallet security.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:38:58
Thanks for reply.In our solution,Only one private key with 1000 btc will touch usb drive at the same time when get btc from cold storage and after it is used,we will never use it again.So our private keys is absolutely cold when it is not used.

And for third question,it will be transported by two people at the same time and protected in a box with a lock.nobody has the chance to copy it.

In our continued drive to operate the world’s leading Bitcoin exchange, OKCoin is introducing sub-accounts for corporate and institutional clients globally. This is a first of its kind in the Bitcoin exchange space.
Under this feature, one master parent entity can separate trading into multiple sub-accounts to run various different strategies under one roof. This allows for example, one trader to trade OKCoin futures while another separately can trade on margin or deploy strategies based on technicals, fundamentals, arbitrage etc.
In our testing phase, several of the world’s largest Bitcoin trading firms have enabled this feature for their operations. Institutions interested in getting set up can send a request to corporate

Thanks for reply.In our solution two different people hold the encryped private key and the password.
@_date: 2015-03-14 03:56:42
When we get btc from cold storage,only 1 private key with 1000 btc will transfer through usb drive.after it is moved to hot wallet,next private key will transfer.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:12:34
Only 1000btc will in one private key,so the risk is small.If the usb  drive is hacked,maybe the online wallet is also not safe.but use qr code transfer signed tx is also an option.Thanks

And when we generate the encrypt private keys,we will make the computer totals offline and has a double check to confirm we can decrypt the key from encryped keys.after we print the encryped keys,the disk will be formatted.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:09:34
Yes,off course.The purse of multi-sig is double check.We use AES encrypt the private key which has the same effect with multi-sig.I just wanna say absolutely cold is most important for cold storage .Thanks for reply.
