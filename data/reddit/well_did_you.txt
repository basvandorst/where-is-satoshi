Group **C**
Bitcoin is a consensus system; it can be used to implement settlement, and therefore BTC as money.
This *core* system needs to be rock solid, simple, and conservative.
The Bitcoin network can be augmented with quasi-separate systems/layers that optimize certain uses; something like the Lightning Network can be added to the Bitcoin network, on top of the core system, to optimize money transactions, and thereby turn BTC into a currency.
Other, more complex or experimental usages can be attached to the *core* system (and to each other) through 2-way&amp;nbsp;pegged sidechains, and therefore form a web of systems, communicating through the common medium of exchange, BTC; this whole ecosystem can, then, still be viewed as being Bitcoin.
This is the Internet of Money.
We, Group C, want a well engineered core system that is decentralized and impenetrable, and we want the whole ecosystem built around the dumb-network principle, with the burden of implementing and supporting special-interest applications pushed to the users and administrators of those applications.

Well, I deliberately chose "population" rather than, say, "country" or "nation"; indeed, as has pointed out, the participants of the Internet—especially when bound together in economic measurement by a currency like BTC—can be viewed as a "population" or even a "nation" or "country" (by means of a more generalized notion of those terms).
However, I would note that if you compare the dollar price of a house on the coasts of the United States with the dollar price of a house in the middle of the United States, you'll find a vast difference; regardless of a common currency, one population's valuations of commodities (including the currency) differs from another.

That's a nice post, but it's a straw man.
I wasn't arguing that "Bitcoin is private enough"; I was arguing that it's lie to say that Bitcoin is \[inherently\] traceable \[down to the user\] and that it's therefore bad for engaging in activities that some government deems criminal.
It's actually been *very* good for engaging in those activities, despite the pitfalls—and as you point out, it's only going to get better.

Counterparty is not a sidechain; rather, it provides a blockchain that is *embedded* in the Bitcoin blockchain.
Thus, Counterparty is more tightly bound to the rules of the Bitcoin network, and the Bitcoin network must suffer the burden of processing and storing Counterparty's day-to-day administrative data.
However, Counterparty works *today*.
My guess is that Counterparty itself will eventually transition to becoming a sidechain, with the advantage that it is more or less already proven, and enjoys a growing userbase.

Not so.
While a Bitcoin transaction may indeed be sent peer-to-peer, that transaction must be confirmed as valid by a third party; that third party is the Bitcoin network.
The innovation is that the Bitcoin network is decentralized, and therefore less likely to be influenced by special interests.
Bitcoin involves a third party: The Bitcoin Network

Here's what you need to know, from [the project website]( and from [a&amp;nbsp;blog post about it](








Maybe I don't have a clear understanding, but it seems like the Bitcoin blockchain (or a blockchain in general) is only incidental; it's merely being used as a way to distribute digitally signed hashes of documents.
That is, an institution like MIT hashes an official certificate (the JSON document), and then by constructing a Bitcoin transaction essentially digitally signs and publishes that hash (indeed, publishes it in a way such that the recipient is more or less notified directly through the Bitcoin transaction).
However, MIT could juts digitally sign the hash and send it to you in an email. Or, because a certificate is not exactly a large document, MIT could just sign the document directly, and send you the signed document, which you could then pass around as a file.
**In other words, I don't understand the point of using Bitcoin.**
It looks like the purpose of Bitcoin is to serve for the lack of useful infrastructure around managing signed data (that is, managing keys); this seems to be [confirmed in the blog post](


Because Bitcoin inherently requires infrastructure for managing keys and signed data, they're just piggy-backing on Bitcoin out of convenience: Let the Bitcoin world handle that infrastructure.

Alice constructs a Bitcoin transaction, prints it out on a piece of paper, and hands it to Bob as payment for Bob's services. Bob says "Thanks!" and then takes home that piece of paper, types its data into his computer and sends it off to the Bitcoin network for confirmation.

Either your use of the Bitcoin network is profitable, or it's not.
People who have unconfirmed transactions are receiving a signal from the Bitcoin network; that signal says the following:
* It doesn't look like your use of the Bitcoin Network is profitable; either this is true, or you yourself have not yet provided the network with a clear signal that your use of network is actually profitable—if you want to signal the network that your use is profitable, then please include a larger transaction fee.
    RBF and CPFP will be useful in re-signalling the network.
As the technology that runs the Bitcoin Network improves, it will become cheaper to process transactions, and thus even these transaction that look unprofitable *today* will become profitable in the future.
That is how these things work, people: Through evolution by variation and selection, the world figures out what is profitable *now*, and how to make things profitable at some point in the future.

* &gt; It’s worth noting that the MIT Media Lab has become a central Bitcoin hub and assumed a de facto leadership in Bitcoin technical development
    Well, they've assumed they have this role, anyway.
* Here's what you need to know, from [the project website]( and from [a&amp;nbsp;blog post about it](
    &gt; The following three repositories make up our digital certificates architecture:
    &gt; * [Cert-schema]( describes the data standard for digital certificates. A digital certificate is essentially a JSON file with the necessary fields needed for our cert-issuer code to place it on the blockchain. We tried to keep the schema as close to the open badges specification as possible and expect to be even more closely aligned with the next version of the specification.
    &gt; * [Cert-issuer]( takes a JSON certificate, creates a hash (a short string that can be used to uniquely identify a larger digital file) of the certificate, and issues a certificate by broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction from the issuing institution’s address to a recipient’s address with the hash embedded within the OP_RETURN field.
    &gt; * [Cert-viewer]( is used to display and verify digital certificates after they have been issued. The viewer code also provides the ability for users to request certificates and to generate a new Bitcoin identity.
    Maybe I don't have a clear understanding, but it seems like the Bitcoin blockchain (or a blockchain in general) is only incidental; it's merely being used as a way to distribute digitally signed hashes of documents.

    It looks like the purpose of Bitcoin is to serve for the lack of useful infrastructure around managing signed data; this seems to be confirmed in the blog post:
    &gt; Ideally certificate recipients (such as graduates or workshop participants) would create their own key-pairs and then share their public key with us in order to request a certificate. But the amount of technical sophistication required to do this makes a broad roll-out prohibitive.

Except that your productivity is tied to everyone else's productivity; that's why a currency must fluctuate over time between populations and within any population.
A fuckup is an inefficiency in the economy, and it's likely a loss in the economy's wealth; thus, it's worthwhile to make sure everyone around you fucks up as little as possible.
When Bob performs a service for Alice, Bob charges Alice some amount of money; this money is a proxy for some amount of productivity in the economy that is denominated by that money. Indeed, Bob and Alice come to an agreement about their exchange through their objective and subjective calculations as to Bob's productivity, the productivity of the economy as a whole, and what each hopes will be an increase in the productivity of the economy due to their transaction.
Bob intends to spend his money at some point in the future; that is, Bob intends to convert his money into some productive service for himself, tapping into the portion of the economy's productivity that is owed to him, as accounted by the money.
However, Bob doesn't spend his money for 10 years, leading to at least 2 scenarios:
* In that time, an asteroid strikes the planet and destroys half of the population in the process; in so doing, the asteroid also wipes out a significant amount of the economy's productivity—whole cities of productive people and equipment and knowledge are utterly wiped out.
    As a result, Bob's money represents a much smaller amount of productivity than he thought it would when he got paid by Alice; that money is not worth as much as it was when Alice gave it to him; everything is very expensive now, due to the loss of productivity.
* In that time, peace falls across the world, and weapons and militaries are dismantled; all of the resources that those things used up are freed for productive development, leading to a boom in technology that offers exponential gains in productivity; fusion reactors make energy so abundant and clean, that the economy could produce enough for 8 planets filled shoulder-to-shoulder with people. Replicators make all manner of tools and food accessible with the push of a button.
    As a result, Bob's money represents a much larger amount of productivity than he thought it would when he got paid by Alice; that money is worth much more than it was when Alice gave it to him; everything is very cheap now, due to the gains in productivity.
The reasons for the variations in the value of Bob's money is because that money is merely a proxy for a varying quantity; Bob's money is a proxy for some amount of the economy's productivity.
In order to decouple one's money from the rest of the economy, such that Bob's money *always* represents the same amount of productivity, the money would have to be more than a proxy; it would have to be the productivity itself—when Bob wants to eat a hamburger, some portion of his Ideal Money would have to transform with 100% efficiency (as per the laws of the Universe) into a hamburger, etc. When Bob wants a field plowed, some portion of his Ideal Money would have to transform with 100% efficiency (as per the laws of the Universe) into a plowed field.
Basically, the money would have to be pure energy (as per the laws of the Universe), forever at the ready to be transformed at 100% efficiency (as per the laws of the Universe) into whatever form Bob desired of that energy (as per the laws of the Universe).

Centralization does and will occur in the Bitcoin network, because centralization is much more efficient than decentralization in terms of resource usage.

Your deductions are erroneous.
What I've outlined doesn't preclude multiple reviews; in fact, what I've outlined would better enforce it, especially for lowly untrusted newbies, as each repository in the web of trust is owned by exactly one gatekeeper:
A pull request could be sent from a newbie to the maintainer of a subsubsystem who is used to dealing with newbies; that maintainer sends the collected work up to the maintainer of a subsystem, who more or less trusts the work of the maintainer of the subsubsystem, but who is free to review that work and participate in the mailing list discussions about changes. The maintainer of the subsystem in turn sends his own collected work up to the maintainer of the system, who plays a similar role at that most high level.
In this way, changes work their way up not just through a chain of command, but also through a web of command, as the maintainer of the whole project would himself be expected by community convention, courtesy, and prudence to submit his own work on the subsubsystem to the maintainer of that subsubsystem, and let his changes work their way up with the rest.
**This is exactly how Linux works.**
Surely you realize that when it comes to Linux, multiple people review changes, it's very hard to dictate bad decisions, it wouldn't matter if any particular person deleted his repo because the web of authority would quickly reroute and heal the power vacuum, and not one person makes all the decisions.
A lot of people use Ubuntu. At one point, at least, Ubuntu was downstream of Debian, which a lot of people use; Debian provides a Linux kernel that is considered downstream from Linus's kernel, which a lot of people use as the "vanilla" kernel; your remark about a lot people and companies relying on the master branch of a particular repository is worthless.

Transaction malleability makes it risky to spend an unconfirmed (or underconfirmed) transaction, though.
Until it is sufficiently confirmed, you cannot even spend your own change transaction safely. Think about that.
**SegWit fixes transaction malleability.**
That's why it is so important; it not only makes Bitcoin transactions much more sanely auditable, but it sets a stronger foundation for scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.
The Bitcoin network provides settlement; with a more sophisticated addition to the ecosystem (such as the Lightning Network), BTC can finally be used more like a currency.

I wonder whether a hard-fork upgrade to Bitcoin could be implemented as a sidechain so that people can test the waters, so to speak, and thereby give the ecosystem a way to upgrade voluntarily.
When some threshold is met for adoption of the sidechain, the sidechain could takeover complete control from the old version of Bitcoin.

Overall, you make a very good speech.
In my opinion, [you came very close to making a lovely introduction here](










Yes! *YES!*  
However, you fuck it up in the next sentence:


Besides the fact that this is historically untrue (go read about [Tally Sticks]( it's also unhelpful and wrong.
This is what you should say:
* All of you are familiar with payment networks: *Ada* and *Bob* want to transact, so they use a third-party payment-processor like *Mastercard* to facilitate their transaction.
    Well, it's *exactly* the same with Bitcoin: The Bitcoin network is a third-party payment-processor, like Mastercard.
    The difference is that the Bitcoin network is *decentralized*—no&amp;nbsp;*one* entity or organization controls the Bitcoin network, and that means it has no central point of failure; *anyone* on the Internet can participate in running the Bitcoin network, and thus only the participants' common, general interests are reflected in the policies of the Bitcoin network.
    This means that the Bitcoin network is fairly immune to corruption, censorship, and the demands of special interests. The U.S. government successfully put pressure on Mastercard to deny donations to Wikileaks, but the U.S. government couldn't stop donations through the Bitcoin network.
This is where you can explain the difference between transactions and confirmations:
* Now, when *Ada* pays *Bob* through Mastercard, *Bob* gets notification of the transaction almost immediately (in the old days, he made a copy of the credit card information, and that was his notification of payment).
    However, it takes time for Mastercard to process the transaction and confirm that it is indeed valid; maybe there weren't sufficient funds; maybe it wasn't really *Ada* who was making the payment.
    Bitcoin is *exactly* the same: *Bob* receives notification of payment as fast as *Ada* can give it to him; if she sends it to him across the Internet, it's as fast as sending, say, an email.
    However, it takes time for the Bitcoin *network*—the third-party payment-processor—to&amp;nbsp;*confirm* that the transaction is indeed valid.
    The difference is twofold:
    * Bob can already do *a&amp;nbsp;lot* of validation himself, because he himself can be a participant in the Bitcoin network.
    * Whereas confirmation through Mastercard actually takes weeks (if&amp;nbsp;not months), it only takes about 10 minutes through the Bitcoin network; in&amp;nbsp;fact, the Bitcoin network continues to generate confirmations roughly every 10&amp;nbsp;minutes *for the rest of time!*
        Every new confirmation compounds the last, and so settlement occurs very quickly—*exponentially* quickly!
        After 6 confirmations from the Bitcoin network (about an hour), it's virtually impossible for the transaction to be reversed; in terms of probability, that transaction becomes *Truth* on which you can depend with almost as much certainty as you can depend on the laws of physics themselves—and if you're really paranoid, you can just wait for a few more confirmations.
Well, what do you think?
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:03:16
Venezuala's problems are the result of the issuers of the currency stealing purchasing power through inflation of the currency supply, and then squandering that purchasing power on wealth-destroying spending.
One of the reasons that the Constitution of the United States explicitly lists Gold and Silver as the currencies to which government is meant to be constrained is to avoid exactly this kind of theft of capital—a government cannot just print more Gold and Silver; at least, that would be unlikely.
Similarly, Bitcoin's design explicitly avoids that sort of theft.

* Because of transaction malleability, the transaction that you are expecting to be confirmed might not actually be the transaction that is ultimately confirmed—some other, equivalent but *different* transaction might be the one that the network ultimately confirms.
    This is incredibly stupid.
    Not only has it resulted in bugs, as you've noted, but it virtually destroys turn-around-time with respect to constructing and sending transactions.
    Were it not for transaction malleability, Bitcoin could handle chains of unconfirmed transactions, which not only provides a more intuitive and satisfactory user experience, but also allows for a more efficient and versatile system.
* **Your mistake is viewing the Lightning Network as being external from the Bitcoin system; it is, actually, *part* of the Bitcoin system. It makes the Bitcoin system much more sophisticated than it is today.**
* Under some conditions, cash (e.g., a bunch of dollar bills) is a currency: Buying a coffee; under others, it's not: Buying a private jet.
    Under some conditions, bank balances constitute a currency: Buying a private jet; under others, they don't: Buying a coffee.
    Some technologies bridge the gap: Debit cards; then again, you probably cannot easily use your debit card to purchase drugs on the street corner.
    **To determine what something is, look at the properties that it exhibits.**
    
    A currency is necessarily a money, which is necessarily a commodity;  
not every commodity is a money, and not every money is a currency.
    The Bitcoin system's BTC token is clearly a commodity, has the requisite properties to be considered a money, and—under some situations—exhibits the properties of a currency.
    * Waiting 30 minutes for acceptable confirmation of your coffee purchase is not redolent of a currency; at most, it's redolent of a money (like gold).
    * Waiting 30 minutes for acceptable confirmation of your ebay purchase is redolent of a currency, because you have to wait for the product to ship to you anyway, so it's as though the exchange were instantaneous.

1/10 of penny is probably going to be thrown out as dust by most nodes, unless you're planning to spend more on the transaction fee than on the value you're trying to transmit to another peer.
At such small values, the margins for the service being provided are probably atomically tiny, and thus the service would only be profitable through very high volume and through synergy (which, by the same reason, requires quick turnover with related services and high volume).
There's no such thing as a free lunch; it takes bandwidth, storage, and computation to process transactions; it takes *real* resources.

To be more precise, a peg is a protocol mechanism by which tokens from one transactional system can be effectively transferred to the control of another transactional system; a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg means it is intended that the tokens can also be transferred back in the other direction.
The value of doing this is that your BTC tokens can be handed over to another system (say, a proprietary Fortune&amp;nbsp;500 system, or a better version of Bitcoin itself), and then they can be transferred back to the originating Bitcoin system when necessary.
When multiple systems are hooked together in this way, you get an Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money.

A miner need not accept any transaction; if a transaction requires inputs that are not yet in working memory, then the miner could refuse to process the request unless the user submits a suitably high fee.

Under this organization, there is no central point of failure.
Importantly, every contributor comes to realize that he is simply in control of his own repository, which includes being in control of deciding which other repositories are "official" (that is,"of particular interest") for some purpose.
In fact, git was designed to cultivate this very property.
If the "official" repository (Wladimir's repository) becomes unreliable, people will naturally shift their focus (if only temporarily) to the next most "official" repository, say that of or There's also nothing to stop a finer-grained hierarchy or web of authority from evolving organically: Wladimir might delegate most maintenance of wallet code to someone who cares about it deeply; along with everyone else who wants to make a change to the wallet code, Wladimir might submit pull requests to that person, and then Wladimir would accept the final changes to the wallet code as a pull request to his own repository from that person, etc.
Most users would trust Wladimir's repository, Wladimir trusts a few colleagues' repositories, and those colleagues trust a few others, and pull requests pulse through this web of trust, which evolves under the variations and selections of everyday activity.

How about existing forms that have been common for decades for all manner of large-scale, open-source, distributed projects that are run by disparate persons across the planet:
* **Mailing Lists**
    For serious discussions intended to be archived and referenced and possibly sustained for lengthy periods, there is no mode of communication more proven than \[e\]mailing lists—particularly ones that are open to the public both to read and participate.
    Email is fundamentally a peer-to-peer technology, and this is reflected in these mailing lists, the best of which use the list server as just another third-party made privy to the direct conversation between participants; indeed, *anyone* can set up an archiver, and anyone can break off and begin discussing something privately, off-list, as necessary.
    Moreover, partly because email standards are old and crufty, big mailing lists tend to enforce rules about using the lowest-common-denominator formatting: Plain, pre-formatted text (incuding ASCII art), for which there is usually at least one easy way to view the message as intended.
* **Internet Relay Chat (IRC)**
    For many of the same reasons as email, this has been an excellent way to engage in real-time, "face-to-face" meetings with a dynamic group of participants.
Now, everyone has wanted improvements on these things; hell, it would be great to have a standard way to produce emails with TeX-quality typesetting, embedded graphics, and interactive widgets, etc., and to seamlessly shift between the nature of discussion through email and the nature of discussion through chatting.

*Anybody* can make a pull request.
That's the point; Gavin made a pull request, and likely the one de&amp;nbsp;facto maintainer accepted it or not.
The problem is that few of you plebs understand how modern software management works; the notion of multiple people with commit access to a single repository is old fashioned, outdated, and unsafe. Frankly, there should only be one maintainer who has sole commit privileges to a particular repo.
For instance, the "official" Linux source code is simply one of Linus Torvalds's personal repositories; *nobody* except for the Linus says what goes in there, and pull requests work their way up to him in batches from mere mortals all the way up through various demigods.

The blockchain stores a set of transactions.
In order to insert a new transaction into the blockchain, you have to have some method to convince the Bitcoin network do so; that method usually involves a piece of data that a person may store in any way that he wishes, such as in the cloud, or on a piece of paper, etc.
It is that data about which we are speaking.

You should also note that in order for transaction *A* to be used as an input for transaction *B*, it must be the case that *B* completes/satisfies the computer program specified by *A*.
Currently, the most common (and indeed especially supported) computer program involves using Bitcoin addresses and their associated private keys, but there's no particular reason why a transaction *must* use such a program; in the future, perhaps Bitcoin's transactional programming language will be expressive enough to specify programs that are very complex, and which are known as "smart&amp;nbsp;contracts".

That's simply not true; it is the technical level at which microtransactions are just not yet feasible.
* Microtransactions imply quick turnover; yet, confirmations by the Bitcoin network are not quick, and transaction malleability utterly destroys chaining unconfirmed transactions—even ones you'd think you could trust, such as your own change transactions.
* Microtransactions imply high volume; yet, the Bitcoin network cannot handle even volumes that are desired for non-microtransactions.
    * Currently, Bitcoin is founded on the notion that *somebody* has a copy of the complete blockchain; a super high volume of transactions would probably be untenable with today's commodity computing systems.

A Bitcoin transactions is indeed peer-to-peer, and it happens as fast as one peer can send data to another peer.
However, the trustworthiness of that transaction is determined through confirmation by a third&amp;nbsp;party: The Bitcoin network; that confirmation takes time.
This is the same situation for credit cards; the only difference is that for a credit card, the third party is centralized, whereas for Bitcoin, the the third party is decentralized.

Here are some criticisms.
* One *can* share one's Bitcoin address with all, but one shouldn't; it's *not* like an email address in that sense. Currently, it's important to use a new address for each transaction.
* &gt; [It has *zero* counterparty risk.](
    It does have counterparty risk; it's just that the counterparty (the Bitcoin network) is decentralized, and the risk is designed to decrease exponentially with each new confirmation received from that counterparty.
* Nicholas essentially makes everyone think that there are no fees. Several times, he refers to the fact that money can be transferred through Bitcoin essentially for free, and then goes so far as to [say the following](
    &gt; When you \[accept BTC\], you get *100%* of the value of the transaction.
    &gt; Visa, Mastercard, Paypal; they all take *fees:* They take base fees, and they charge you forex fees. They have minimum account balances.
    &gt; There's *none* of that in Bitcoin; it's *literally* like me handing you cash, except it's purely digital.
    What *bullshit!*  
It's just not true.
    First of all, Bitcoin has transaction fees, and though they are smaller than the fees paid to the operators of existing payment networks, the users of Bitcoin must hitherto be much more aware of dealing with them. Maybe various techniques like RBF and CPFP, or the Lightning Network, will make hiding fees easier.
    Secondly, using Bitcoin is *literally* nothing like hand cash to someone. Sure, the transaction itself can be handed to that person, but that person must essentially get a third party to confirm its validity; that person must get the Bitcoin network to process the transaction and give the "OK".
    Thirdly, there are kind of minimum account balances; your value can be stuck as dust.
    That's how it works, folks.  
If you pretend otherwise, you'll just leave people confused.
    Look, [here he goes again](

So, what if the 2 kids' parents have access to a better financial system than the hedgefund managers in Canary Wharf, because they have access to a global, open financial network **that doesn't take fees**, that allows them to transact instantly with anybody else in the world.

* Proof-of-Work (PoW) is simply the means by which you can allow anyone to participate in managing the blockchain; that's what allows for the management of the blockchain to be handled by a dynamic group of anonymous actors.
    That's it.  
It's a spam-mitigating feature.
    * Consensus among honest participants is the result of participants wanting to avoid the costliness of dispute. There's no need for PoW.
    * Consensus in the face of attackers is the result of PoW making it too costly to start a dispute.
    PoW is spam control.
    Hell, that's what Hashcash was meant to do, and Bitcoin's variant of it simply improves upon the idea by scaling difficulty dynamically and benefiting from the compounding properties of chaining.
* When people say "Blockchain", people mean "Using Merkle trees to create a cryptographically auditable record".

This is the classic tradeoff between **time&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;space** (computation and storage).
For the most part, the immutability of the Linux git repository's data is bound up in its distribution across space (people's clones), though there is a case to be made about computational checks, as well.
Bitcoin not only implements this same distribution across space (people clone the data), but also across time: If an honest cloner morphs into an attacker, he will be fighting many younger, honest selves across time, as well as his contemporary cloners across space.
That's awesome.
However, it's only necessary when you want to be able to form a network out of a dynamic group of participants who are anonymous.
Git could introduce PoW, and then I'd be able to clone happily from Torvalds's Linux git repository without worrying, because the chained PoW across time would be pitting Linus against many iterations of himself.
However, that's just not necessary. It's much more efficient for me to make comparisons with contemporary peers whom I trust.
Similarly, in the case of a banking industry's blockchain-based payment network, what is the likelihood that enough banks from various legal, geographical, and cultural jurisdictions are going to be sufficiently compromised such that it becomes dangerous to rely on distribution through mostly space? It's not high, especially when many of those jurisdictions are composed of people who are not only wary of each other, but maybe even explicitly *hate* each other.
Moreovoer, if a bank system chooses to publish its blockchain, then it will be much harder for that bank system to introduce new policies that conflict with old policies.
**What makes the Bitcoin network interesting, though, is that *anyone* can participate.**
That means that the Bitcoin network is the transaction network most likely to implement policies that are representative of the most general interests of sentient beings; a bank's network (blockchain or otherwise) is most likely to be defined by much narrower, more special interests.

First of all, I'm not an expert; these are my layman's thoughts.
* Yes. In Bitcoin, accounting is implemented as strings of valid transactions, and a *particular* set of strings is selected by the blockchain so that everyone coalesces on the same selection and can therefore communicate intelligibly with one another.
    So, in an abstract sense, you go through the blockchain in order to find the particular set of strings that the Bitcoin Network has selected to represent the accounting, and then you go through the strings in that particular set in order to calculate balances and formulate new transactions.
    Keep in mind that using Bitcoin addresses is just *one* way to formulate a transaction—that's why it cannot be as simple as keeping an explicit balance; the more general solution is to store strings of transactions, and then decide what "balance" means for whatever particular purpose you have in mind.
* Well, in order to use the blockchain to verify that Merkle root, you'd have to trust that you have the correct blockchain in the first place, and some would say that means you'd have to have verified the whole thing from start to finish *anyway*, which means you'd have already computed the UTXO set on your own, making that Merkle root pretty useless.
    However, perhaps it would be useful to those who have an *incomplete* view of the blockchain; a new node that is in the process of verifying the entire blockchain, or an "SPV" node that doesn't care about having absolute trust, could just download the UTXO set directly, and then get a pretty good sense of its veracity by seeing that an associated Merkle root is buried in an increasingly long segment of what *could* be the blockchain.
    That could go a *long* way in making it cheaper to tap into the trust of the blockchain, I suppose.
    Futhermore, requiring that miners embed into each block a Merkle root for the associated UTXO set would, I suppose, ensure that the miner itself has computed the associated UTXO set (and thus validated the blockchain), which could help thwart "SPV" mining, whereby the miner doesn't validate a lot of the data just because it *probably* is correct.
    Given my opinion that the future involves a distributed, decentralized, incomplete view of the total abstract blockchain, I could definitely imagine having something like the UTXO set merkelized into each block.

Securing the blockchain is an extremely cool/useful purpose for all of that computing.
Even when a block containing zero transactions is produced, it helps compound the security of the existing chain that much more.

Currently, the UTXO is computed by processing the blockchain from start to finish; of course, that computation can be stored along the way, so it's relatively cheap to *maintain* the UTXO set after an initial synchronizing with the rest of the network.
In my opinion, in the future, the UTXO set will not be maintained in full by each node; instead, if you want to make a transaction from very old inputs, you'll probably have to supply data to miners indicating why your transaction is valid, thereby pushing the burden of management to the people who actually care about the data: You, the user.

However, *I* don't care to check my UTXO set validity every single block; why should I have to support a network that provides such information at all times just because you want to do so? Especially just because you want to do so only occasionally, anyway! 
Also, what if the nature of the Bitcoin system changes such that a UTXO set doesn't really capture how accounting is performed? Then it would just be an overhead to keep such information in the block for the sake of compatibility.
As much as possible, the people who care about some feature should be the ones to bear the burden of implementing that feature; in this case, *you* (and others like you) should bear the burden of maintaining the data you care about.
This is why it's important to be very careful about changing the *Core* of the Bitcoin ecosystem; it's not a good idea to stuff more features into the general subsystem unless it's "provably" useful *in&amp;nbsp;general*.
