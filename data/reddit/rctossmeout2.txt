People don't really like to brag about losing money.  Do you ever make a facebook post when your cleaning your house?  Nah you post vacation pics and shit.  People mostly talk about the positives in their lives.

I usually pay "within 5 blocks" but when that fee is $20 put what I can afford and hope for the best.  So far, I've had one take 48 hrs, and one take about 4 hours.

nah I'd never go that high, my average is like 128

have you tried a us vpn?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:02:58
idk if that's even an issue anymore, I think that was an OG bitcoin problem and has been solved

So if I'm reading this right 120-350 would be the best fee to use right now, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:54:29
How long does that take when fees are normal?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:35:50
Electrum let's you choose the fee

I wasn't guessing per se, I was in no rush so i set my fee low and hoped for the best.

Good point, It does, however I don't see many posts about it.  I mean yeah when you're brand new to bitcoin and bought in at $17,000 and the next day it's $15,500, you might make a post but once you've been here long enough and understand how volatile this market truly is you'll see less and less posts like that.  With bitcoin's insane rise to $10,000+ so quickly there are a TON of new people who think that they're going to buy in and see a $1000 increase every day.  I think these are the people OP is talking about.
