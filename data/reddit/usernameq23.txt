Bitcoin “creation cost”, do you mean cost to mine? That [varies significantly by location ]( .

The main answer is transaction fees. 
But what seems to be overlooked often (unless I’m missing something) is that we will never mine all the bitcoins. The mining reward continues to half (12.5, 7.25. 3.75. 1.725, 0.86, 0.43, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05...) and never gets to zero.

I wish that when people talk about bitcoin replacing fiat (like here/ bitcoin time traveller etc) they would stop suggesting that bitcoin is still valued in USD. 
Why would you value something compared to something it has replaced?

Just made a real world bitcoin convert. 
Elderly lady though bitcoin was a scam, talking to her about the Winkelvoss twins and their thoughts on bitcoin distrusting the gold market was enough to convince her it wasn’t a scam at least. 
Whatever you think of them, if “bitcoin billionaires” is made into a movie the size of “the social network” then it will do wonders for real world legitimacy

It’s the other way round (imho), first comes mainstream adoption, then comes stability. 
Stability (in terms of currency conversion) is relative. It’s equally accurate to say that bitcoin has been stable over the past year, and usd has fluctuated widely. The only real difference is the purchasing power (in terms of what real world things) can be traded for 1 usd. If suddenly everything were priced in bitcoin, then bitcoin would be referred to as ‘stable’ and usd as fluctuating.

I like it. 
Like Moneybox (in the UK, not sure about anywhere else), but for crypto.

A new (similar) design would do just fine. There’s just something magical about holding (and hodling) a physical Bitcoin like that
