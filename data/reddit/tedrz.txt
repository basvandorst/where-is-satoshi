Oh no!  It's Roger...alone.

This is just plain silly.  All that was needed and WILL BE NEEDED is a block size increase.  Amazing that the Core devs are willing to let market cap slip below 50% just because of ego.  Ahh well, at a small enough market cap no one will care any more about bitcoin and we can all just move on from the stupidity.  I wonder what that point is.  My guess is 30%.  
By the time Bitcoin isn't ruled by King Maxwell, it will be too late.  Honestly anyone here still supporting no block size increase should be ashamed of themselves.  Just how stupid are we going to let this get?

He's not helping.  He only "invented" full proof of stake not even proof of stake itself.  Most people are confused by this.  Also, it really wasn't that much of a stretch from proof of stake.  
This guy takes credit for WAY too much.  Also, they are astroturfing here now in case you don't know.   
Don't fall for his tactics of trying to pretend to be nice now.  Look at his original comment.

Give me a break.  Ethereum ALREADY does more transactions per day than bitcoin and coins like Raiblocks can do 7000 transactions per second on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:45:22
Roger did.  He's at millions of homes now transacting because he must be a trillionaire if you count all the fees.  That would be a lot of pies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:22
This is only possible if all miners colluded as the fees would go to individual miners.  This is not and has never been a spam attack.  However, limiting the block size to 1MB HAS killed the network effect so there is that.

You work and earn your bitcoin.  The value of bitcoin goes up in three months as prices go down.  That's your loan.  If you feel your business will outpace the rate of return on bitcoin then you spend it on your business.  People start "loaning" you material goods and services as opposed to fiat in return for a steady stream of bitcoin--natural loaning with a deflationary currency.  Banks simply aren't needed when you have a currency whose units can become forever smaller as prices go down.  
Don't buy into bs Keynesian theory on economics.  They simply want to separate you from your money.  Everyone will feel and be much richer with fair money NOT just the elite that create it and "loan" it to their buddies. People will spend.  Bitcoiners do now.  Feeling richer tends to make you looser with your discretionary spending.

That Roger is everywhere.  He probably has Jihan up his sleeve too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:53:16
Why would I do that?  I already know they'll tell me the money supply must be inflated to keep the economy going. The central bank must balance between recession and inflation...yadda yadda. 
By the way, they better be real careful pushing that message as I personally have been working on a coin that does just that but does it fairly.  It's pretty much bitcoin with a peg but a fair distribution as it inflates--imagine that.  If I get pissed off enough, I'll release it or just publicly detail the technicals.  I'm sure others are working on their own versions also.  So,you see if the deflationary coin is stopped by force, we'll just release the inflationary coins that accomplish the same things but in the backward way it's done now BUT the people will benefit and not the central banks.  I look forward to them explaining why those coins are bad.

Text can be read from a printout just in case.  I didn't know you could take binary to QR codes directly.  Still I prefer my method.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:05:37
Yes, the sooner bitcoin is replaced as the market cap leader, the better off we all will be.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:16:29
Core should have just upgraded to 2MB.  This whole thing has been beyond ridiculous.  The people in this sub know it.  The situation is hopeless and it's perfectly clear Bitcoin has become a one company coin.  There is no will of the people any more and ego, or something worse, rules the day. 
Edit:  Jesus, just hard fork to 1.5 MB to save face and say you only think it should be done in .5 MB increments for security reasons.  Then do it again in 6 months--whatever has to be done to have a usable coin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:06:38
Nahh..he made it from bitcoin.  How else would he have trillions to make all these transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:40:30
I know.  I just put a 2 cent transaction through.  It's like the old days. Roger is silly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:45
Why so mad at Coinbase?  The real bitcoin will win--whichever one it is.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:20:54
Sorry I didn't read that.  I'm too annoyed at the high fees while other coins have none in some cases.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:40:09
That would be best since you've also written a file with your private keys and seeds in plain text on that box.  For me though it's just a laptop with an encrypted hard drive.  There's a lot of flexibility doing it this way though imo.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:03:28
Yall got ANY more of them megabytes though.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:32:30
Sorry I read the first sentence but that's it.  It's Keynesian economics we're fighting.  Go read the definition.  It's not needed anymore.  You are a dinosaur and your days are numbered.  


Hard assets are fine.  Fiat currency is evil.  Don't worry though, you'll live long enough to see it end and you'll be thankful.  You'll probably still be in denial but you'll be thankful.    
By the way,  I'd wear it as a badge of honor to be in I haven't been there but it sounds like a bunch of Keynesians sitting around talking about the fake nobel prizes their heroes "won".  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:47
They did...nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:09:45
Wrong.  It's Keynesian.  They just didn't have a name for it before--same practice.  Don't worry though, it will soon die.  
You may want to look up the difference between Keynesian and Austrian economic theory.  You seem to be confused.  


Thank god for a currency that can be as divisible as you like huh?  No need for banks anymore.  
From Wikipedia to dumb it down for you:  


Translation:  Let us increase the money supply so we can water down your currency holdings while making ourselves absurdly rich.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:37:34
  
Go worship your fake nobel prizes.  You're a dolt and your days are numbered.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:04:19
I didn't know that.  I haven't actually done the QR conversion but figured others might want to.  Thanks Grg
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:43:48
Yeah...that would bring down fees for sure.  That would show Roger.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:35:15
Not to toot my own horn too loudly but this is the best way to keep your crypto safe imo.  Read the comments for other tips.

Die you evil devil...die!  
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:35:38
It's backing up again.  You can't have any meaningful amount of transactions without it backing up now.  Bitcoin is just a joke now for actually moving money...unless you're rich.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:32
Roger told me.  He said, "I hate my investments so much, I must destroy them."
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:54:33
You could also do this to .bash_history and filetoencrypt.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:28
It will  have zero effect with a block size so small.  You literally have to make 2 transactions so it's just not going to happen as is with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:53:39
There is NOTHING you can do.  No amount of groveling will ever make the unmentionable company that controls bitcoin now actually fix it.  They are either ego driven, purposefully trying to hurt bitcoin or are retarded.  They clearly aren't retarded so it's one of the other two. It's simply not going to get fixed.  Plan accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:36:14


This is the real problem.  There is a ton of legislation forcing monopolies on people.
