But they don't. Once the channel closes all those transactions will end up on the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:58:16
What if my channel is depleted of coins? How is it ensured every channel has enough funds to process every transaction?
@_date: 2019-07-05 09:28:14
But if I send btc to the lemonade stand than how does this reduce transactions? Don't we only reduce transactions if you have payments back and fourth? Then only the difference would be transacted on chain. But if all transactions are only in one direction, how would we lower the on chain transaction volume with lightning?

Don't take out loans and live somewhere cheaper.

Are you a troll? Your whole assumption is based on lies. Google how miners get paid.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:46
I totally agree with you. It's written like some salty teen's blog. The compression analogy is completely off and calling it slightly cheaper transactions is the understatement of the year.

According to Mycelium the fee for a 3 hour wait time is 88c
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:52:06
The only reason it's expensive is because expectations are high. If you live frugal you don't get into those problems unless there is something like a family tragedy.

Bitstamp was hacked? 
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:35:07
you don't understand technology if you think 20$ as a transaction fee doesn't completely diminish any future potential of bitcoin. so every time bitcoin becomes unusable we have to wait several years until some random guy develops a technology to fix it. so the world economy just grinds to a halt for a few years. ye, right.

Did you listen to the two sentences he added to clarify?

The reason your numpad has a point is because your country uses a point and not a comma. Germany has a comma.

Can anyone tell me if OP has anything to say in the Bitcoin community? I don't know him but according to his comments he is mentally unstable. I might have to sell my Bitcoin if he is speaking for the core team.

Rich people also use infrastructure 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:35:55
I'm not arguing against infrastructure spending. I just don't understand why you want to fund it via money creation. The moment the government has the ability to create money for expenditures other than the UBI, you will not be able to limit it to infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:34:50
Not true. The price of gold just adjusts to balance it out.

If I have a cold wallet and let's say there is 1 BTC on it, can I receive my 1 BTC and my 1 BCC when I redeem it in a few years? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:31:06


@_date: 2017-07-01 07:54:16
You are flipping miners and pretend you are running a solar mining operation on a profit.
@_date: 2015-02-14 04:56:12
I have some issues with his reasoning and the top comment of the second link put it really well.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:48:59
Why do you have BCC in the first place and how did you get them? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:58:26
Why doesn't Bitcoin just stay Bitcoin? What do you have to do to keep the main fork?
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:28:44
But it isnt. He makes money by flipping miners and claims that thus his solar thing is profitable. That's why the parody claims he is using hydropower while in reality everything is done by hamsters. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:07:46
He didn't tell you because the whole story is fabricated. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:43:59
Well I'm in favor of a guaranteed basic income to assure a steady flow of money in the economy. In my opinion that would be far better than propping up politically selected industries to create more jobs. Concerning inflation I think the theory is that people and companies stop hoarding dollars if inflation is higher.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:08:59
He does not only think the government spending during war times is good for the economy, he also thinks the destruction of cities is a good thing because we have to rebuild them. He craves for a destructive earthquake or hurricane.
I linked something below post and talked about it.
Here's the link.
My opinion about it is in the answer I gave @_date: 2013-12-29 16:15:18
He is arguing that the stimulus the government creates during war times will get us out of the depression and presents World War II as proof. In the video at the bottom of the second link he talks about the alien invasion.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:43:34
Why not?
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:32:08
Oh, I'm not a native english speaker. I didn't know awesome can have another meaning.
I know about the buffer thing and I agree that it's not settled whether it would result in a net positive compared to a non-interventionist policy. But that was not what I meant. The alien invasion is exactly the broken window fallacy. He said even if it was fake it would get us out of our slump. Just because the government spend money on alien defence mechanisms. So basically you create a false demand for something and produce worthless things to better the economy. How is that different from the broken window? You destroy it and rebuild it. Resources are wasted in both events and you end up where you started in both events. Just to free us from the so called "liquidity trap". And in the other article about the World Trade Center it appears that he thinks, an earthquake would be a net positive for the economy.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:57:22
The links I posted only address the spending side of war, I agree. But since I know that in keynesian theory the destruction of wealth is portrayed as a good thing for the economy because we have to rebuild everything I searched for something Krugman wrote about it.
On September 14, 2001 he complains several times that unfortunately the attack on the World Trade Center destroyed too little wealth to have noticeable positive effects on the economy.


In one sentence he says:


You could think that he admits the destruction of the buildings was a bad thing, but no he means the function of the World Trade Center. The destruction is a good thing. He immediately follows with:




In neo-keynesian theory war is all in all a good thing. Not only the government spending to create all the war material is good for the economy, the destruction of cities is also a good thing because we have to rebuild them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:02:05
Now I think you over interpret what he said to make it look more reasonable.
After the moderator said that concerning keynes even paying someone to dig a ditch and paying another one to fill it up again would be beneficial to get out of the slump, krugman just acknowledged it and went on to the World War II example.
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:40:16
Oh, really?
Edit: deleted post was: "No he is not"
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:47:32
I thought he's in the "war is good for the economy" camp anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:12:28
Well I guess the pain/gain is more evenly spread. I guess there will still be a problem in recessions because one camp takes the position of "we can only spread what we take in" and the other one the position of "in a recession we have to increase the GBI to get us back on track". 
If you are interested here is my model of a GBI for my own country Germany.
* Everyone pays 50% in taxes.
* Everyone receives 800€ per month in cash.
This means:
* If you are unemployed, you get 800€.
* If you earn 400€, you pay 200€ in taxes and receive 800€. So you've earned 400€ from your work, but end up with 1000€ (400x0,5+800). That's a negative tax of -150% ((400-1000)/400).
* If you earn 800€, you pay 400€ in taxes and receive 800€. You end up with 1200€ (800x0,5+800). That's a negative tax of -50% ((800-1200)/800).
* If you earn 1600€, you pay 800€ in taxes and receive 800€. You have reached break-even, where taxes and handouts are equal and you end up with 0% taxes.
* If you earn 3200€, you pay 1600€ in taxes and receive 800€. You end up with 2400€ (3200x0,5+800). That's a positive tax of 25% ((3200-2400)/3200).
* If you earn 80000€, you pay 40000€ in taxes and receive 800€. You end up with 40800€ (80000x0,5+800). That's a positive tax of 49% ((80000-40800)/80000).
Furthermore you could say parents don't receive the 800€ for their children in cash but get 200€ cash, a 200€ health insurance voucher and a 400€ school voucher. (In Germany children are covered under their parents insurance though)
No state financed universities, of course. Basically everything is concentrated in the guaranteed basic income.
If it is done this way, it reduces bureaucracy by almost 100%. Furthermore it smooths out the transition from being unemployed to being employed because your handouts will not be taken away the moment you have found work.
