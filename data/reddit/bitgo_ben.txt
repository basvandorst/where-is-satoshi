Not exactly true. With futures, for every long position, there is a short. Given the risks of naked shorting bitcoin, what I expect to happen is: 
1) institutions go long the futures since they can't easily hold bitcoin directly
2) prop traders go short the futures, while going long bitcoin directly to hedge, earning an arbitrage spread in the process
The prop traders / arbitrageurs are the transmission mechanism between institutional demand and the actual bitcoin price.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:40:31
What's the argument for why number of transactions is proportional to number of participants? I could argue it would already be proportional to the square of number of participants, in which case you'd be applying an additional squaring factor for no reason.

The data is already being verified by client-side javascript on the page you're viewing. However, you can use the external page additionally. In order to do so, you need to copy and paste the entire JSON blob into BOTH boxes on the external tool.
You cannot directly verify the reserves of greater than 706 BTC. That is the role BitGo is playing as a co-signer on the multi-sig wallets held by ChangeTip.
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:59:41
I believe the problem is that some wallets are producing a rounded up integer number of kilobytes to multiply by the fee rate, leading to paying more fees than necessary. There is no quantizing of kilobytes in bitcoin core, so doing this is strictly incorrect.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:53:33
It is direct verification of reserves by another company staking their reputation on the fact that we're attesting to. Very similar to when Ernst &amp; Young signs off on an audit. The direct verification by users is on the liabilities side -- only you can verify that your balance has been correctly included.

Our BitGo keys are generated and encrypted in our isolated key server (equivalent of the HSM, but not custom hardware). All key generation and signing happens within the key server. The master AES encryption key used to encrypt the BIP32 keys only ever exists in-memory in the key server while it's in operation, and no single BitGo employee has that key. When the KeyServer is restarted, multiple BitGo employees must participate in an activation process using hardware Yubikeys to reconstruct the master AES key.

@_date: 2014-06-26 20:08:15
Ben from BitGo here. What you're envisioning is certainly a possibility. But what BitGo does, is actually very similar to what you imagine, in practice.
When you send a partially-signed transaction to BitGo, we don't simply automatically sign it. We first require a one-time password from your 2FA device. Effectively, you are proving to us that you are in control of your phone, without that phone needing to actually store a Bitcoin key. We think this is better for a number of reasons:
1) If your phone is stolen or lost, we can help you establish a new 2FA device, and there is no concern that a private key has been exposed. We are also actively working to provide a more seamless 2FA experience, that would allow approving transactions directly from the phone, as opposed to copying over a numeric code.
2) We can apply additional server-side logic to our co-signing decision based on rules you or your organization have set up in advance. Our Enterprise wallet currently supports features such as spending limits and multi-person or multi-institution approvals, which would not be possible to implement client-side.

I have highest respect for the Coinbase guys. I know Brian and Fred well -- and they are doing a tremendous job bringing new users into Bitcoin. To be honest, an off-blockchain pooled wallet is ideal for certain use cases -- it makes micropayments economical, for instance. And for users who aren't storing amounts that are irreplaceable, it isn't always worth trading off ease of use for additional security. But for users storing enough Bitcoin that it would be a devastating blow to lose it, it is worth putting some time and research into how to best secure it. And we think using multi-sig will ultimately be the right way to achieve of best-in-class security while not giving up ultimate control of the coins.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:33:06
We hope we can marry the security of cold storage with the transactability of a standard wallet. It's my hope that over the next year or two we can help usher in the end of Bitcoin's cold storage "ice age." I don't think cold storage is ever going away completely, but even for cold storage, multi-sig can offer improved security and flexibility.

Ben from BitGo here.
We allow you to reset your account password, using email, but that does not allow you to spend your funds without the wallet-specific passcode which is set up at the time the wallet is created. BitGo does not have access to that passcode. If it is lost, the funds cannot be recovered without using the Account KeyCard, which is also created at the time the wallet is set up, and is only held by the user.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:47:28
Ben from BitGo here. Sorry you're experiencing some problems signing up or signing in. Have you already mailed us at support Would appreciate if you can do that, referencing this thread, and letting us know what email address you're using for your account, and we will investigate.
To clear up some misconceptions elsewhere in the comments: BitGo only generates/holds 1 of the 3 keys. The other 2 keys are generated and encrypted client-side. One of these keys (the backup key) only exists on the backup KeyCard which you print at wallet creation time. The other is encrypted client-side with your wallet passcode, and stored on the BitGo server. This is the exact same methodology used by Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:55:05
Ben Davenport from BitGo here.
BitGo does provide significantly increased security vs. any single-key system because multi-sig allows us to eliminate single points of failure.
Let's take the case of a Blockchain wallet (not picking on them in particular, just the nature of single-key). All of the keys necessary to transfer bitcoin are present on your client machine. They could be stolen directly by an evil browser extension, or indirectly through key-logging malware that captures your primary (and secondary) password. Or, someone who hacks your email, can access your Blockchain backups and attack the encryption key offline.
In comparison, malware which steals your user key or encryption password for a BitGo account still has only managed to capture 1 out of the 2 keys required to produce a valid signed transaction. BitGo holds the 2nd active key and requires successful 2FA through Authy before co-signing a transaction. The 3rd (backup) key is held (by the user in most cases) entirely offline.
For our multi-user wallets (currently an Enterprise-only feature), further validation may be required before BitGo co-signs a transaction. For example, Alice and Bob are both admins on a multi-user BitGo wallet, with a spending limit set to 1 BTC per transaction and 5 BTC per day. Alice and Bob together share 1 active user key. If a 10 BTC transaction is submitted to BitGo through Alice's account, BitGo will not co-sign immediately. Bob would be required to login to his BitGo account, pass 2FA, and approve the transaction. Only after that, would BitGo co-sign the transaction.
One commenter mentioned 2FA reset as a threat vector. In the case where 2FA access is lost, we take a risk-based approach, depending on the size of the balance. We prefer to weight security over convenience of access. Since the user holds 2 keys and can recover funds independent of BitGo, BitGo can take a very conservative approach about allowing 2FA to be reset. Also, for our enterprise customers, we do have alternate ways to validate identity.

@_date: 2014-05-28 19:28:49
Hi booey. Actually, you still have exactly that full control with BitGo's model. We operate with a 2-of-3 key model, where BitGo only controls one key. The user controls 2 keys (an operational key, and a backup key). BitGo cannot ever move BTC without the user, or block the user from moving it on his own. The difference from a single key model is that there is not a single point of failure/attack.
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:08:14
Why do you have to trust us? We have 1 key of 3, but 2 are required to transact. And are you not proposing trusting Coinkite in the same way?
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:18:14
I don't think this is a great setup at all. By increasing the key set to 6, but still only requiring 2 to transact, you double the potential weak points from a 2-of-3 setup. Moreover, you do have to trust that your wife and son do not collude during your lifetime (perhaps unlikely, but why take the risk?) I have two alternate recommendations for you, depending on your price sensitivity.
1) Setup a BitGo Enterprise Basic account ($20/mo), providing a cold offline xpub for the backup key. You can use CoinKite's tool or a number of other tools to generate the cold key. This will then give you a wallet with 3 keys (BitGo, user key, backup key). Set a spending limit of X BTC/day on the wallet, and then add your wife as a second admin. Once she is an admin on the wallet, either you or she will be able to transact up to X BTC/day without the other's approval, but any spends over that will require double confirmation. BitGo enforces these policies by choosing which transactions it will co-sign. Your wife only has one key (the user key, which you also have). But because you alone retain the backup key, you retain the ability to transact unilaterally if your wife refuses to approve, or if BitGo happens to go away (unlikely). In the case of your death, she can either drain the wallet slowly, or present a death certificate to BitGo to have you removed from the wallet.
2) Setup a free BitGo account and share the cold key with your wife (in a shared safe deposit box, for instance). The initial setup of the wallet is the same, but it won't have your wife as an active user on the wallet, and it won't have spending limits. You and your wife retain 2 keys between you, and have the ability to move funds if BitGo disappears. In the case of your death, you can leave her access to the account password in a safe deposit box only you control, or she can use the backup key in conjunction with BitGo to recover the funds.

No, not natively. But, with a service like BitGo, you can set arbitrary rules. (I work for BitGo.)
Adding more keys than 3 quickly becomes difficult to reason about, from a security perspective. Are you increasing security, or decreasing it by using a larger key set? It also likely won't achieve exactly what you want.
BitGo uses a 2-of-3 system, where BitGo's key allows it to serve as an "arbiter" or policy enforcer. For instance, a system like BitGo can support the following types of rules:
- Allow Bob to spend up to 2 BTC per day by himself. If he wants to spend more, Alice must first approve.
- Allow Alice to send as much as she wishes to a set of white-listed addresses. If she wants to send somewhere else, Bob must approve.
- Only allow sending transactions between 9am and 11am Monday-Friday.
- Only Bob can spend, but all transactions must be approved by his wife.
- Don't automatically send a transaction that originates from an IP address outside the user's home region.
... and so on.
We believe this is a very powerful model, that will only improve over time. The blockchain itself may be able to enforce more rules over time, but not to the same level of granularity that this model achieves.
(Note: BitGo holds only 1 key, meaning the customer retains full ultimate custody of funds.)
@_date: 2014-09-28 07:29:00
Short answer: you shouldn't be using Shamir Secret Sharing to split single keys when true multi-sig is supported by the protocol.
The scheme you're describing sounds sufficiently complex that it sounds very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with. And good luck explaining to heirs what to do to recover your bitcoin horcruxes... Or even worse... what's preventing your heirs from combining their rows prior to your funeral?
There is a point where additional complexity actually adds risk, rather than reduces it, and your scheme is well beyond that point. Is 4-of-7 safer than 2-of-3? Maybe, maybe not. More shards means more points of attack.

The user was asking for a secure P2SH solution that met his three requirements. My goal was to let him know of an alternative using our platform which meets his needs. I'm not sufficiently informed on Coinkite's platform to make a recommendation there. He certainly may be able to meet his needs with a 2-of-3 setup using Coinkite as well.
There is a lot that can go wrong when users design their own m-of-n schemes without sufficiently thinking through all the implications. And I stand by my assertion that 2-of-6 is a bad idea.

@_date: 2015-01-29 19:10:47
You've described a scenario where the two signing keys will be present unencrypted on the local machine -- the exact dangerous scenario multi-sig can help you prevent.
The reason BitGo and others do it the way we do it is to avoid 2 keys ever needing to exist unencrypted on the same machine. The signing takes place on separate machines. Storing the encrypted user key on our server is a convenience to make the web wallet work smoothly and to avoid the user having to directly manage a key.
Please note that if you are using BitGo through our API ( you do not have to store any encrypted key with BitGo.

I can't go into specifics of the Bitstamp implementation of course. But the general sorts of policies that BitGo wallets support are: spending limits (per tx and velocity), ip restriction, time-based restriction, target address whitelisting, and webhook callbacks.

Logging into your BitGo account by itself does not download your key. The client is not allowed to even download your encrypted user key without you passing an additional 2FA step. In order to transact, you then enter your wallet passcode which decrypts your key in the browser and allows the client to half-sign a transaction, after which the client dumps the key.
We'll be looking at how to integrate BitGo with hardware key options in the coming months.

The redeem script is abaolutely required in order to spend from a P2SH address, just like the public key is required in order to spend from a P2PKH address. The redeem script can easily be constructed from the N public keys in a multi-dig address.  The difference is, that in a single-sig wallet, the public key is easily derivable from the private key. But in a multi-sig wallet, you may not have all the private keys. So you MUST have a record of the public keys (or the public root keys used to derive them.) However, remember that one you've spent even once from a P2SH address, the redeem script is permanently visible in the blockchain. There's no chance of losing it at that point.

BitGo Instant is actually an on-chain solution.

Spot on, as usual for Vinny. Only thing I disagree with is that his scenario of steady 2x-3x annual gains is very unlikely to play out. Any asset that is predictably increasing at such a rate would attract so much demand as to result in a much bigger increase in price (and subsequent crash to new higher level).  Greed and fear will rule, as always, until some possible day far in the future where Bitcoin could achieve true boringness at a high and relatively stable price.

No. We do it on the weekend, and have never so far paid more than 7 satoshis/byte to do so (10x lower than the typical rate). Blocks will be full one day, but they are not now, on a weekly basis.

Hi OP, Ben from BitGo here. Would be curious to know what sort of errors you're getting from the recovery tool. As you've noticed, the recovery tool is a bit more involved to use, because it generally should not have to be used, except in the case BitGo truly goes away (which we don't foresee happening). It is designed to be entirely independent of any BitGo backend services. We'd encourage you to test out the recovery process, if you desire, on a test wallet, but then set up a separate wallet.
In terms of providing access for loved ones: First option is you can add them as an active user on the wallet while you're alive (with appropriate spending limits / approval controls). In the case of your untimely death, BitGo could facilitate access to the funds by removing the need for your approval upon the presentation of a death certificate. Or, you can provide them access to the keycard / backup keys maintained in a safe deposit box which they have access to with a death certificate.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:36:26
If you are able to get your money out, you might want to come have a look at BitGo for a 2-of-3 wallet where you maintain 2 keys. We provide an offline recovery tool which always allows you to get your funds back if BitGo is offline. Moreover, BitGo is servicing some of the largest exchanges in the business, so we are religious about uptime.

Troubling, to say the least. But not yet directly applicable to ECDSA keys. Based on the methodology they describe, you'd have to be signing something an attacker crafted for you, not a transaction you constructed yourself. The bigger near-term risk would be against wallet-level encryption, but there might be even easier attacks for that (detecting key strokes, for instance). A good multi-sig wallet ultimately solves both attacks.

That's what I love about Bitcoin too! But it doesn't mean I keep all of it on paper wallets buried in concrete. For spending or trading money, I'm much more willing to trade off absolute control for convenience. Note that unlike a pooled account at Coinbase, say, money in a BitGo wallet is still very much Your money, segregated, on-chain. The KRS provides a completely cold key for construction of the wallet, and their relationship is with YOU, not with us. The only agreement we have with them is to give us a bit of advance warning before co-signing a transaction, so we can clear any outstanding instant transactions.

No relation to payment channels. Doesn't help with sending micropayments. Does help with receiving instant credit for transactions of up to 1000 BTC (our current per-tx limit).
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:10:16
Our sends account for about 7-8% of transactions by number, but more than that by size, due to multi-sig.

Did they make an announcement they are doing a distribution? I'd probably just go with next best alternative in that case (GBTC). Premium is much lower than it was.
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:48:51
Yes, to clarify, no fiat involved. This is all BTC movement, converted to dollar terms. Over 4M BTC moved. We also have no way to juice volume artificially. We only have 1 key to each multisig wallet.

LOL. That's not even the right fork! That is the Bitcoin Unlimited chain split token.

This is a real bummer. Specific reason I opened an IB account a while back. The notice is quite clear though. The restriction is on trading, not on owning. The "closing only" in the title means you can only trade to close an existing position and cannot open a new one. My suggestion: head to the Winchester, grab a pint, sit tight and wait for this to all blow over. Eventually either bitcoin hits a price where you actually want to sell, another competing fund becomes available in the US market, or this stupid restriction gets lifted.
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:38:52
Nope, we didn't claim to do 25% of anything.
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:23:50
No, we are explicitly excluding change. We mention that in the announcement:

Full post-mortem here:  TL/DR: Funds have been returned, and BitGo will be awarding a 25 BTC bug bounty on top of that. Thanks to all from the community who helped out!
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:59:48
I don't think we can say that. Don't think anyone can really know the total real value being moved on the network due to difficulty of determining which outputs are change. We know that for our own wallets but not for transactions in general. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:42:20
More likely, we've touched a smaller number of high-velocity bitcoins multiple times over that period. Our multi-sig technology is particularly well-suited for securing bitcoins in motion, when cold storage is not much help.

But please come talk to BitGo first - we are hiring!

The AMA is taking place on bitcoin.com, not here. But to answer your question, A) we don't have any patents to donate yet, and B) there are several different efforts underway for a shared patent pool, including MIT's, and we are actively evaluating all of them.

But that's $443,410 less we have to pay in taxes, right? Right? RIGHT?
For context, the government spends about $6 million a minute, so this auction will cover about 3 minutes of spending.

Unfortunately, this has been par for the course on Reddit. As far as I'm concerned, it's a wasteland. Productive conversation is moving elsewhere.

Wouldn't it be far simpler and achieve the same effect, with no protocol changes, to just be more selective about which UTXOs to load into memory, going to disk-based-index for those we predict will be unlikely to be accessed?

I encourage you to try a number of options and decide what's best. But I want to let you know that BitGo just rolled out our new web interface, written from the ground up, and simultaneously unlocked all features for individuals for free. Our new free web wallet has full support for multiple users and spending limits -- hope you'll give it a try, and let us know what you think!

More realistic assumption would be node user counts follow something more like a power law. Here's an example possible breakdown of 10M users that is more realistic than a uniform users/nodes count:
    Nodes	UsersPer	Users
    1	      1000000	1,000,000
    4          250000     1,000,000
    10        100000     1,000,000
    50          20000    1,000,000
    250          4000    1,000,000
    2500        1000    2,500,000
    10000        100    2,500,000
		
    Total                  10,000,000

Authy handled this very well, all in all, helping customers get upgraded libraries quickly well in advance of releasing the information. Also, as a matter of responsibility, any company offering a web-based API should take responsibility for its own input sanitization and should assume any third-party library behaves in the worst way possible on bad input. In this case, all that was needed was a simple regex check of the input.

Miners don't care about probability of mining the next block. All they care about is revenue per unit time. Since difficulty on both chains is the same, bitcoins mined per unit time is the same. (In other words, miners are not in competition with each other. They are in competition with the difficulty setting.) So revenue per unit time is entirely defined by the USD price of one chain relative to the other. Whichever chain is more highly valued by the market will be more profitable to mine.

You can absolutely do that. The web interface allows you to enter your own xpub as a backup key. You can create this key on another machine (and indeed you should!).
If you have an issue with server-delivered Javascript, then perhaps you'd feel more comfortable using our Chrome App.
If you really want to review all the client-side code yourself, you can use our command-line tool, which is completely open source, and not that large to read. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:36:33
That's correct - it's not something we'd expect to be run by individuals. It's designed for businesses such as exchanges or other services running an existing hot wallet on bitcoind.

Unfortunately, that's not the case. There's a team out there, another Bitcoin company, who systematically downvotes any BitGo reddit story to oblivion. I won't name names, but would just say: grow up, guys.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:24:32
Maybe that's the best way to tank a story, if you want to bury it -- just use Reddit's own upvote spam prevention against the story.
For the record, we don't vote manipulate our own stories. And if we did, we'd have to be pretty stupid to keep doing it when it kills the story time after time.

Hey everyone, Ben from BitGo here -- excited to get this out there. We've found this to be a great tool as a power user to directly interact with our API from the command-line. It's a great way to check on stuff as you're developing against the API, or just to use as a fast lightweight way to access your BitGo wallets.

It's not javascript per-se you dislike -- it's JS delivered from the server each time.  Give our command-line interface a whirl -- it's Javascript (Node), but it's easy to read, and you control when you update it:

Hi Fidasx,
I'm sorry for your frustration. Because it appears we contributed to the problem of allowing you to accidentally remove yourself from the wallet (hence, removing our copy of your key), we will be happy to cover the recovery fee in this case. Will correspond privately on your customer service thread.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:09:38
That site actually shows there are 3 active (unopened), and 2 opened.
