I haven't tried withdrawing yet, but I tried tipping you with more than I have on Reddit to see what happens and it sent me a QR to pay the difference. Let me see if it works if I just pay the "invoice" from bottle.
Edit: It worked! this is so cool.
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:29:54
You would still need to time entries and exits which is arguably the toughest part.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:37:21
Wow there Roger, relax.
edit: Actually its probably CW, more his style.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:08:40
I have not tried that yet.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:33:12
Most investors don't have the risk appetite for an asset with as much volatility as Bitcoin has had, also 99% probably don't really know much about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:13:55
That is probably true.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:59:23
Thank you, that was very insightful.
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:12:58
I would assume they build their miners in batches, run them, then turn them off and send to customers. That's why you would see a spike up and a spike down and the next spike is higher than the last since the shipment has reached the customer by the time they made a new batch.

Great tech innovation, but If that NYAG investigation does not go well and Tether is not fully backed, this might not end well.

I want to know more about the age group the sampled. I don't think 4% of American population in aggregate really knows how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:18:46
That's why I am so curious of what people think. Currently, there does not seem to be a huge direct financial incentive to develop it fast and routing is an extremely complex problem to solve.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:42:57
It would be interesting, but hard to pull off since he doesn't trade actively due to travel and competition like that you would have to trade 24/7.

Thanks! Haven't heard of it before. How can LN wallet be non-custodial?
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:20:43
You are not really buying Bitcoin on Robinhood, you are buying an IOU or a derivative of it.

@_date: 2019-07-19 02:56:56
You don't trade do you?
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:45:10
Yeah looks like I have to read up more on LN wallets. I always thought that to be non-custodial it always had to be connected and if it disconnects you would lose your satoshis.
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:02:58


@_date: 2019-07-19 13:57:51
Easy to say that when you don't make calls publicly.
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:37:55
What is this? You can tip through LN somehow?
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:00:42
Doesn't Bitmain mine customer machines before sending them out?

We have had about 8 recessions since 1900 and about 47 since the Articles of Federation. How do you battle a recession if your currency is Bitcoin? If you can answer that question legitimately, I am pretty sure you would win a Nobel Prize in economics and don't cop out and say we wouldn't have recessions if Bitcoin was the currency of the world.

I think you forget how correlated money is to the government. You can't really have one without the other in the western economies especially. The separation of the two is uncharted territory which could be chaotic, I am not sure that most people want to see that.

Oh I didn't Eclair had a desktop client, makes sense now.

It does not allow confiscation, but if a law passes which makes possessing Bitcoin a felony or a crime or similar severity we will see how many people will hodl.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:50:48
Schnorr signatures are still theoretical I am pretty sure, lightning is still in development and has to overcome some colossal challenges. Making fund transfers anonymous might be the trigger that would ban Boitcoin because it would be easy for politicians to demonize it. Just look at what Japan is doing with privacy coins.    
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:42:46
Do people seriously still think that BTC can just replace fiat currency? Governments will never, ever allow that. Even if it was possible, I am not sure you want that to happen. What happens in a recession when you can't adjust rates and there is a huge crash? There are currently no mechanisms in bitcoin to adjust monetary policy when economies are overheating or enter a recession.   
The way I see it, is Bitcoin will just be a separate asset class entirely, its use and market cap will grow, but it will never replace cash. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:43:46
I guess no segwit or batching is less important than shitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:06:56
You can send Bitcoin without internet as well so what's your point? There has been zero development in Bcash since it forked and don't give me that bullshit that increasing block size or opcodes is a development. So who is lagging now?
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:46:27
Not at all, and we are a on a path of unsustainable levels of debt, BUT the current system is strong and unlikely to change any time soon.  
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:55:25
There is no evidence that traditional markets are in any way correlated with crypto markets currently. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:03:14
Let's not kid ourselves, if the banks really fail or if there is another huge crash in the markets, BTC is going with them as it is still a very speculative asset. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:52:10
I didn't know there were POS wallets ready to receive lightning, or am I missing something?

Since when stating facts is witty? 
"Try suing. Or, call SEC. Wait Samson is doing that. Call Blockstream man, get Adam Back to stop Bitcoin Cash!"
Sure I'll do... actually no I won't because nobody is using Bcash. Go and try to beat Bcash transaction counts at least vs Dogecoin. Until then your atlcoin is just another shitcoin with no use:
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:09:37
Well with the current price trend I'll be happy to afford a Beetle. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:39:18
That looks like more developers that Bcash has in total in total.  
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:07:42
Since you are so experienced, how else would you purchase a large amount of bitcoin with leverage without actually exposing your actual Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:23:06


I would never consider paying for anything with Bitcoin, unless maybe its something like purse where there is an actual financial incentive to use crypto. Fact of the matter is that crypto is awful at being a currency, it is slow, hard to use and at times expensive to use, but it could be good at store of value. However, if you are smart you will not buy any substantial amount of crypto without some sort of insurance. Sure you can buy a few coins and store them on a Trezor which is fine and dandy, but for real adoption you need big players to drive the price up. The higher the price the more likely that Bitcoin will survive to the point where those players will have enough value to fight for it and lobbying for it at governmental level. If there is demand, the on and off ramps will come, but to have demand you need a market with as many useful instruments as possible for the big players. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:10:32
I see you are new to trading and financial markets. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:24:18
This looks like a potential acquisition list. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:43:18
Everything I said is factual, especially the metrics of usage and trading volumes. Obviously won't post the trading statements of my own or my clients, but getting rid of options will lower the purchasing volumes of underlying asset over the long-term. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:44:15
Speculation is the ONLY use case right now. Who else is using this stuff for anything else? NOBODY. Its slow and somewhat hard to use for the masses. You think you paying for sushi is adoption lol? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:09:00
Right, but if you want to trade and purchase a large position without actually putting your bitcoin at risk how else would you do it?
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:29:51
Lol clapping hands will not change the facts 
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:06:33
I never said derivatives were actually bitcoin. If I am trading, I NEVER actually want to trade actual bitcoin, I would rather trade the option and still hold my bitcoin as it is infinitely more safe. How many exchanges have been hacked in past 8 years? 
My point is that derivatives help with adoption in that they provide a tool for a high networth trader to be able to trade and hedge the underling asset. Mom and pops buying their little 10 or 100 Bitcoin to pay for pizza only can do so much for adoption, you need big players with deep pockets to come in the market to drive adoption, but such parties need tools to limit their risk.  
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:46:41
How is that a good thing?
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:14:24
I see you are new to scamming, gota try something new. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:01:12
WTF are you talking about, what if I am whale and decided to hedge my position when BTC was $20K. Today I would still hold my original bitcoin after riding the price to $3,900 with no losses, then buy more actual bitcoin with the cash proceeds. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:17:14
What innovation has BCH brought to the table?
@_date: 2019-11-19 02:32:14
I think money would be the least of your worries in that scenario.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:27:45
I will ask again, what has BCH group of developers innovated? Most innovations in blockchain are coming from Core devs. 
Speaking about fast and cheap, I've been sending 1sat transactions all month with no issues. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:03:01
There are tons great developers on many projects out there, but BTC has probably the largest and the most competent group overall.  
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:55:40


Def not invented by BCH devs...
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:47:19
All other altcoins are also "doing stuff"...
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:47:05
Bitmain which holds 5% of total BCH supply will effectively be more of a BCH ETF than an actual normal product selling company in my opinion, so his focus might be even more on pumping the coin than selling miners.
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:29:16
Short term - hell no.
Long term - hell yes. 
Don't want to worry about anything? Set a side a small amount each weak and buy in increments while dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:20:11
...and losses.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:22:56
What does that have to do with BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:38:46
Can somebody do a comparison to Bcash, oh wait they copied the code and haven't innovated anything new. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:36:42
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:14:00

This level will not hold, it will consolidate for a bit then down we go. Under 6k it will accelerate. Hopefully 5K will be the bottom.

Us nerds always talk about stuff like this, what I meant was large publications.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:40:33
Definitely not the safest when liquidity is still so shallow. Say you want to put in something small, say $1 Billion. I doubt anyone has that available OTC and if you try to buy it on the market, you will move it against yourself. It gets even worse on the sell side.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:20:30
Double bottoms sometimes don't hold and if they break, they break violently. HOWEVER, if we do break the double bottom by a lot then the bottom will be in.

They are highly centralized to you and only issued by you making you similar to a central bank. If you eat some bad food, that inflation rate will be like Venezuela.

@_date: 2019-06-13 22:25:36
This is great, BUT how much more complex LN will have to become before it is viable to be used by the masses?
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:05:07
Big mining pool as a class-action?
@_date: 2019-06-14 03:38:25
Well if we expect people to run their own nodes and be their own banks, chances are they will want to understand how it works. I probably don't need to tell you that currently that is somewhat complicated.
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:12:36
Think about this scenario: Bitcoin goes to 0 you lose a few thousand dollars (unless you are a rich kid); Bitcoin really takes off over next 10 years and you sold, how pissed will you be that you missed out. 
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:44:09
...but it will likely cost more than 0.0004 BTC to transfer 0.0004 BTC...
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:05:46
Judging by the last two years, none if this stuff is coming soon.
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:55:31
Might as well do the same with BCH while they are at it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:18:09
If BTC fails, its over for the entire crypto space.
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:57:24
Never know Bitcoin might hit $100 again. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:20:55
I assumed this was just an old receipt and looked at that date...DAMN. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:19:28
Good point. I guess theres two ways to look at it: is Bitmain effectively a BCH ETF or is it a hardware seller of miners?
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:51:47
Are mining operations part of the Bitmain IPO? If so I would be livid as an investor right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:01:30
We won't go anywhere until we flush the scams out of the system. Market needs confidence to grow. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:49:03
...and your point is?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:53:24
I love how Bcashers are saying that ABC is spamming SV, but when Jihan was doing the same to BTC that was called "usage". 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:59:20
Once Bitcoin hits 2K you will disappear, people post this shit all the time and then the target hits...poooofffff.

Goodbye Bitmain! 
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:58:29
To those who say that is a low projection, don't forget that the higher you go the more volume has to be injected to just sustain that price, never mind trying 2x from there. Fact of the matter is that nobody is using crypto relatively speaking and its hard to see that changing in 5-6 years.  I hope I am wrong though.
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:02:10
Wow talk about fast progress.  
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:32:34
Well looks like we haven't hit the bottom yet. When "news" like this gets debunked, that is when we will bottom. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 03:32:55
You know something I don't know? Crypto users increased from less than 1% of global population? Transactions counts up?
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:26:11
Likely to stay that way for a while, since there hasn't been much development in past 4 years.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:48:29
That wouldn't allow them to mine as much info though.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:06:21

My aunt Betty's Technical Analysis indicates $25,569.32 by December so there. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:44:45
How fast does Bcash steal this and claim it as their own? Or does it need SegWit to work? 
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:11:32
Well that's what proof of stake is.
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:50:53

He doesn't have a Billion, doubt he even has a million. 
Edit: he does have a million probably since he scammed the Australian Gov out of grants. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 01:37:55
Segwit - sure.
Schnorr - I don't think BTC has that yet.
2nd layer - still way too complex for an average user. 
Taptoot - I don't think BTC has that yet.
Satelite nodes - cool, but unnecessary. 
I think developments to improve user experience would be more beneficial for adoption at this point. The basic core wallet's interface looks like it was made in 1985.
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:38:13
I agree, but I think you missed the OP's point. Fiat is not useless, not yet. Crypto has a looooooong way to go to mainstream adoption. When aunt Betty is giving little Timmy satoshis for his birthday, then we can say fiat is no longer useful.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:30:43

In the finance world, bonuses are paid out after the fiscal year ends typically. So all the way from Feb to April typically, unless you are evaluated quarterly than its sooner, but still after the year-end.
