I tried to forward port 9735 and 8333 as well to it, yeah.  So let me know how that goes.  I have a fair number of Satoshis sitting on it.  I decided to go into the terminal and just type in the lnd commands myself.  I was able to open three different channels to some of the more connected nodes.  The problem I'm having now is consistency making a payment to any service off of this site:  [  I also haven't been able to get an invoice or anything sent back to me off of the one site I was able to get working.
Outside of that sometimes the pi has been a pain to get up and running if I rebooted it or the software rebooted it for whatever reason.  I just turn it off and on until it miraculously starts working.  Either way I suppose I've gotten some experience with ssh and I do have a full node running...so that's good regardless of whatever else happens.
Thanks again.

Hey, thanks for your help.  I just sent you the info through a private message on this.  I do have one channel open and active somehow or the other.  The issue I was running into last night after I realized that was making a payment of any sort on the LN itself.  It took an eternity then would time out.  I tried to get the web UI up.  Think it's called RTL or something of the sort?  Haven't been able to get it to work when typing in the local IP it gives.  Get the feeling it didn't download correctly so maybe I'll try to go by the github page and type in the manual commands instead of getting the pi to do it auto.
Thanks again.
EDIT:  Just tried it on Satoshi's Place and it finally did work, lol.  So it's just all over the place...maybe I'm just flat out being too impatient.  I don't doubt I could use another channel open, though.

Me too, don't worry. Lol. That's great. Seems like an improvement at least. I just flashed the SD card a week ago going off of the raspiblitz guide on GitHub but probably can afford to check again. Probably also could afford to look into Zap and other wallets.

This is the error I tend to get most often:  [

Thanks.  That's all very helpful -- same for everyone else that has commented.  I'll take a look into all those and keep researching and brainstorming in the meantime.
Thanks again.

Interesting.  Thanks for your help.

Nobody knows what the hell is going to happen, really...

This is just an honest question. Not trying to argue, stir up FUD, piss off anyone, etc. I'm just trying to learn in areas where I'm not as informed as I'd like to be.
Clearly this guy dumped a lot of BTC. Let's put aside whether he should have done something else and the law behind all of it. The consensus is his selling crashed the market? Or was simply a part of the decline?
Does anyone have any numbers to reflect the decline with his selling? Not just a chart correlating with a decline. Can anyone show exactly how much the price dropped when his order went through? I guess my thought is, how much would his sell alone actually change a &gt;100b mcap market.
I'm trying to get the cold, hard facts of it instead of the possibility people just want to pin everything on him to make themselves feel better. Is there any decent source that says: when X amount of BTC is sold the price will go down Y amount?

Def gonna moon now.  No way around it.  Lol.

Thank god.  I thought I was the only one who saw it.  I just went all-in.
