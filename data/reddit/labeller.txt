"On-Chain scaling" is resolved by Segwit. If the bulk of users don't need to settle on-chain or do so less often then Bitcoin suddenly doesn't have an issue scaling. Segwit will dramatically reduce the cost of sending Bitcoin on-chain as well. The whole idea here is to develop layers of technology similar to the layers of the TCP/IP or the OSI models.
Bitcoin really just needs to be the backbone for this new paradigm.. The protocol itself should not be geared towards just on-chain transaction through-put.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:12:21
It fixes a sort of double spend attack.
It also frees up space on the block chain by changing the signature data in the block and allowing for another layer to be built on top of the block chain for the signatures and effectively allowing transactions to happen off-chain when ideal to do so such as micro transactions and running tab, etc. Here is a great article someone just posted:
It's also an update to the software that most people have been using and developed by the same developers (over simplification) as it has been.

@_date: 2017-02-09 05:01:14
First off thank you for creating this.
A few changes should be made however. On the Segwit side you need to change the 2nd and 3rd bullets under criticism. 
Segwit is a longer-term solution compared to just upping the block size. Also, the larger blocks should be in the BU column.
On the BU side under benefits long term solution is not accurate. Also, id like to see the benefits related to hard-forks listed.
Another note would be to maybe include the support from the nodes. I understand they can be manipulated more so than mining(disk space is cheaper than hash power) but they could also be accurate. Anything 13.1+ is supporting Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:40:38

@_date: 2017-02-08 23:34:57
IMO I think the Bitcoin Unlimited(BU) dialog that has been happening is just a phase. The FUD and attacks happen in waves and if they keep it up long enough and spam enough they may influence some of the people but its only because they don't know better and usually figure it out after a short while. BU, to me, seems like an altcoin that is trying to hijack Bitcoin or some of the Bitcoin crowd. 
I know we need a 95% majority to enable segwit so we need the miners and exchanges to agree so I think it would be best if we organized all of these issues into something simple and visual for them to analyze and decide for themselves. Maybe something to do with a timeline of important events including past discussions or consensus from prominent figures in the community; good or bad. 
One thing is for sure though; the people will have a currency that is free from oppressive regimes. We all win :D

Segwit itself may not be a long term solution but what it enables are long term solutions as well as more room for more transactions(what BU wants with larger blocks). So transversely Segwit does solve the scalability issues.
Changing developers and other fundamentals and creating large blocks is not a solution but a means for certain people to make more money. Upping the block size creates more issues than it resolves.
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:10:21
Bitcoin gives you the long term store or appreciation of value. You have the freedom to trade it for whatever currency or commodity you wish. The point is that the fiat will continue to lose value and negate the effort to save money for the future. So what if we trade it for fiat when necessary?
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:13:55
Have you not been aroynd here long? Satoshi and other have envisioned side chains and confidential transactions and have been working to implement this for some time now. The only reason it wasnt nearly automatic is due to mining centralization based on making there roi. Who here isnt running a updated node?! Most people that are running nodes are supporting segwit. Again... Its the miners.. And Ver or others who want control.

@_date: 2017-03-16 04:37:39
Yes.... You seem to think .75 btc on average, per block is going to disincentive miners.. That assertion is wrong. They have been mining before the added transaction fees as you may recall for a block reward(and before the price was anywhere near what it is now).
It does incentivize layer 2 providers, though.. but those fees will be far less than the transaction fees. That is the only change and it isn't a negative change as you assert.
I hope this helps you understand.

Lets recap your post:
"because it turns BTC into a settlement layer and pushes Txs off-chain thereby changing the dynamics and overall incentive architecuture of Bitcoin dramatically?
Is that not a good enough reason to not want to push SegWit through in your mind?"
First off it does not "Push" transactions off-chain. You will still be able to use Bitcoin how it is now it would just be cheaper.
Secondly, there is no change to the "incentive architecture". Miners still get the miner reward and all associated fees...
Third, If there is a change in incentive its because there is now an additional layer that allows people to support transactions and earn fees. This is not dramatic in the sense you insinuated. It does provide a "dramatic" increase in the efficiency of the system and of transaction throughput. 
Sounds like you get your information from @_date: 2017-03-18 16:55:48
So you agree that is is merely an attack vector and that the majority of core nodes are "honest" or that the BU nodes may be "dishonest".
Hash power can be one loud person talking. If say a government(China/USA) decides to create asics and obtain a large portion of the total Hash power, are they then the rightful deciders of Bitcoins future and then they get to create the software? If that is they case then we are going to move on to something else... or in this case continue using the same software we have been using this whole time. 
The users will decide ultimately.

Yea, BU is the threat ro bitcoin... Jusr like classic and XT. Im i terested in whatever name that come up with next. Also for the fecord anyone can be a part of core.... There using the word core to insinuate there is a spesific core group of people... Anyone can contribute to core.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:45:17
If they didnt make asics we could all be mining. Now normal people dont mine. If they made enough for everyone to buy and didnt hoard them then we wouldnt have the mining centralization like we do and we could all vote with our hash power. Its obvious.

@_date: 2017-03-03 06:38:21
The point is the availability of the asics. Anyone can order a GPU online for a reasonable(mostly lol) price. Now that only a few companies can fabricate efficient asics there is this choke point that doesn't allow average individuals to participate without sacrificing what little they may have. I fully support asics and what ever else may come but again I am concerned that these are not widely available and it is causing a few large companies to have control over whether or not an update is applied. This was not by design.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:46:03

If a particular state/city had just a fracrion of just one of the monthly payments made to the oligopolies in any particular area, we would be able to fund the creation and management of an entirely new decentralized infrastructure.

They have 4 times the population of the US... why wouldn't they have the most mining/trading volume? If you want a decentralized system then expect it to be decentralized.
Also, since we exported a ton of our manufacturing to China.. they are able to manufacture and distribute the chips to the Chinese people/companies first. Where are the ASIC's labeled 'Made in the USA'? I would be mining if I could get a hold of someone willing to sell me a 16/14nm based miner but they are largely unavailable or limited.
Also China has a lot of energy that would other wise be wasted if the miners weren't taking advantage of it and it is more profitable to mine there.

@_date: 2017-01-09 23:51:16
I haven't but its because I'm into bitcoin for reasons other than just peer to peer transactions. Also, it was an inconvenience that I had to overcome that cost me all of my personal information, including picture ID and social.
I didn't want to give up all of my personal information in the first place but decided to because I was willing to pay that price FOR Bitcoin. Not so I can move fiat. Although I have used another app like square cash to move fiat.
As far as storing Bitcoin.. I would rather have it 'under the mattress' so to speak, not in a Bank.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:30:05
Well if one of the big banks, like one of their VC's(gold man sacks), wanted to make a "blockchain" and needed an initial user-base to launch their [coin]app they would target the people that already know about bitcoin or the people interested in peer to peer transactions... and by initially using bitcoin to make us sign up and install their software we are already in the door and on-board ready to use their own fiat transfer system. 
TLDR; Its a Bank and they don't need Bitcoin to move fiat peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:18:07
Ive been here from the begining... We knew these days would come. From the begining bitcoin has been a threat to a lot of bad actors. Some of these bad actors want to destroy or take over the development. Its as simple as that. The anomalies are the bitcoin rich people and companies that profit from forks. There are also the people who want to just get in on the bottom floor and dont give a shit about bitcoin. 
We need to keep it open source and free from corporate control.

Segwit allows people to make off chain transactions which would have earned the miners extra profits from transacrion fees. 
They probably wont enable segwit until they start losing money on slow transarions or too high of fees to cash out or manage their earnings.

Also, this article doesn't mention the current segwit update that is underway, although it does mention "underlying change"... but that is false IMO. I'm sure segwit/etc will be activated far before the usability aspect are updated; which will actually allow more common folk, thus more transactions. But you already knew that, didn't you...
The price going up is great for the people who got in early/earlier.. and those people actually believe in its potential and will continue funding its development.

This block size "issue" is getting old. If we want more adoption we need to keep the playing field level so to speak so that everyone, despite there internet connectivity and storage capabilities can participate. If we allow larger blocks then fewer people will be able to participate and then there will be less adoption and more centralization. That could potentially cripple/destroy bitcoins future. If you want to make a clone of Bitcoin you can. You can 'fork' the github repo and make any changes you want.

I think what is meant by don't invest more than you are willing to lose is that you should not spend more money on BTC than you are willing to lose. Any gains should continue to be held in BTC since we know the price will continue to go up as long as it remains viable.

This is why there is a big push for 0.13.1 that enables segwit.
It allows people/businesses to have open "channels" or settlement nodes?? to consolidate many transactions into one on-chain transaction.
With that sort of technology and the increase in storage space/decrease in storage cost Bitcoin should be able to handle it.
I believe keeping the blocksize down is essential to keep the ledger size manageable over time and also to allow people with limited internet connectivity to participate.

Good luck trying to clean up reddit. Its like a zoo visitor yelling at zoo animals to clean their own cages but half the animals are stuffed. This place has been taken over. Half of it seems to be paid oposition or organizations that are threatened by bitcoin(or whatever other sub). So you will always see bs that can easily make blood boil.
Although there is still truth, lies and everything in between here. Some have good motives and some have nefarious motives. Its a "public" place though.

Full nodes incentivise people to be honest. If you are running a full node to protect yourself, you are also protecting others that check their node with yours. This also decentralizes the network more by providing more network and data redundancy.

It will always continue to increase in value as time goes on. Ups and downs are imminent, just don't follow the price closely. Try and hold off on cashing out if it dips. Remember that every 4 years the supply is cut in HALF!. Summply &amp; Demand... Tons of Holders reduce the supply.

Most young "educated" people or people who regularly watch MSM "news" think the President is a bad guy and wanted either Bernie or Hillary to win. It's because they were all manipulated and actually don't have any interest in politics(and ironicly haven't done their homework) but don't want to be an "outsider" or "weird" because all of their friends and colleagues(and shows ...e.g Mr. Robot) ridicule the President or people that supported him. They call themselves Democrats but cheer on their own enslavement via socialism. They have no idea how money works and want free everything.. but they don't know that that money needs to come from somewhere. They have the idea that taking profits from businesses for their short term stability is a good and fair idea and they don't understand that profits are what incentives businesses to ..be in business. 
All these people have passion and want to fight but they were misled. This happens all the time just not on this scale. The electoral college makes it so even if you focus on manipulating a few large cities (NY, LA, SF) you won't be able to control the whole country.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:56:14
I think the companies that understand have taken the right stance(NO e-corp coin). The others are kinda oblivious and caught in the cross-fire and probably don't want to have to disappoint the people suggesting to change BTC to BS2X. 
The bad actors are probably expecting more power or a better stance in the new financial paradigm by being "in control".
People like Ver and others who hold a lot probably actually have faith in Bitcoin surviving anything and just want to increase their holdings by forking and accumulating more bitcoin.
Either way Bitcoin and the people will be the ones who win in the end.

MSM tries to conflate Bitcoin with bad things like drugs/crime/etc and so people who don't want to be smeared by the people who actually buy the MSM's narrative used "the technology behind bitcoin" as a way to point out that Bitcoin is in fact useful. They just didn't understand it enough to realize that the "blockchain" isn't what makes Bitcoin special. The interesting part of Bitcoin is that it is money created by the people without the built in oppression like our current monetary systems. The blockchain is just one of the security mechanisms in Bitcoin.

Limited supply creates scarcity. It's also very useful by allowing the transfer of value to any other individual without permission or a third party across the globe in seconds/minutes. Also its greatly divisible so it can hold virtually unlimited value. Also, it doesn't matter if companies accept it because you can trade it for any other currency in the world. 
If a single government decided to regulate it, the system would go dark or work around that country and that country would end up missing out on the innovation and wealth. All fiat currencies inevitably fail or loose public confidence as we can see from history(the dollar has lost 90 something percent of its value since the fed.)
