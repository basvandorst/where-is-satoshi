Because maybe there's better things to do with my money. It may be expendable but it's still valued money.

thank you

Actually people will convince me it's good for me if they are able shed light on something that makes sense to me that I was previously unaware of.

Yes he is. What if my dad was a big time libertarian who was skeptical of fiats and central banks?

With or without a career in-between?

Is it not secure enough for other people?

To be clear, I have cash for general spending and in case something comes up. My education is completely paid for and I'm very grateful for that.

How can I understand before I have all the info? That's why I'm here..

Currently I do not have any expenses so I don't think I need an emergency fund. I also have a fair share of money in investments for retirement. Basically, I'm in college and my family takes care of me and will continue to do so until i graduate in 2.5 years.

I take all reddit advice with a grain of salt.

What? Money is a valuable thing, yes.
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:17:10
One of my favorite responses so far, thank you.

you're still not getting it. He's saying if, for the sake of his point, the rules of putting your money on red were changed to where it would be worth a payout of 36:1 as opposed to the standard 2:1.

Bro, I'm the counter-culture.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:55:56
"Bitcoin is created out of work, not debt..." I like that.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:58:29
thank you
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:40:55
Becuase right now I'm not at the stage where you were when you were able to say "what's great opportunity I've just discovered," means I'm not smart? I'm looking for convincing information to get to where I want to put up money or know for sure I don't want to put up money. Do you get that?
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:55:45
thank you
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:04:06
He knows that. He's saying there's a 50% chance the payoff could be exponentially greater than just 2:1.
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:27:19
Can somebody explain this post to me? I genuinely don't get the concept.
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:08:12
point is it's good for exposure.
