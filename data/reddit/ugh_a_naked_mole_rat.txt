Nope. Why? Because bitcoins are just part of my investment portfolio. At this point they're a bigger chunk (in USD) than I'd like to see, but I'm still holding on to them. When I invested, it was at a point where it wouldn't bother me if they went to zero. I still feel that way, and I'm comfortable with my other investments, so I'll let the BTC ride. But I own too many to buy more.
Unlike a lot of folks here, I don't think BTC will become a single world currency or the dominant currency in any country. I don't think it'll be worth millions of dollars per BTC. I do think it's an amazing and useful invention and a clever implementation of digital cash, but I don't think it's worth much on its own in a vacuum.
There are also too many variables and lots of bad actors out there who could screw the whole system up. If you don't believe me, look at all the hate on the front page of Certain people and organizations do have an outsized influence on the system and their motivations don't match up with mine.

How is it worth it? I can't think of a single benefit to using LBC vs any of the exchanges.

Right, it's been stable for a whole... 3 days?

What a dumb and uninformed thing to say.

I think meant the structure of the project. It has just as much toxic infighting as bitcoin. The distributed nature of cryptocurrencies doesn't mean shit when everyone involved (miners, developers, users) are constantly fighting and can't agree on the direction. Bitcoin development has been stagnating to the point where the network is quickly becoming unusable. There's nothing unique about the structure of the ethereum project that could prevent the same thing from happening in the future.
