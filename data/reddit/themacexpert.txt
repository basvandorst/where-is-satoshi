Hi Pineapple Fund. This is amazing! It takes an extraordinary person to do something like this, and you deserve a tremendous thanks. You are doing more good in one lifetime than many could do in 100. My vote goes to supporting ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's Disease, which went viral during the Ice Bucket Challenge. My Dad has been diagnosed with ALS, and although he is in good spirits and hanging in there, it is a disease that makes every day more difficult. He has no doubt that a cure will be found, I just hope it's soon enough. Please consider donating to:  or   Thank you!

Common tip from Andreas - Not your keys, not your bitcoin. 
Edit: one thing I️ like is that bitcoin doesn’t care if you’re a fridge, a human, or a mega corporation - the network is available to all.

Founder and CEO is a smart guy and If bitcoin goes belly up you’re still holding a revenue generating company with assets etc.

THis is very much bitcoin related. overstock HODLs 50% of all the bitcoin they receive in transactions. They were one of the first merchants to accept bitcoin in 2014 I think. And they have a new group looking at legally managing ICOs.  Go OSTK!
