yes. ZERO. it has no intrinsic value. It's a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:15:19
If fees are that high now, how will they compete with Paypal? or AmazonCoin?  And it's not sure WHEN the last coin will be mined. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:08:34
what's stopping other crypto's from being created?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:49:10
can bitcoin inflate?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:16:24
fees will keep rising
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:26:12
why? greater fool theory? Or intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:52:05
again, you're missing my point. If you wanted to take delivery of oil. you could. 
but if you wanted to take delivery of bitcoin , you can't.  am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:25:19
what stops them is COST. nobody is going to pay outrageous transfer fees if VisaCoin doesn't have any or Amazoncoin comes with free shipping. Only criminals. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:30:21
amazon Microsoft and apple have INTRINSIC VALUE that can be measured beyond the greater fool theory of investing.  All these computer geeks might understand crypto but not finance 101. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:08:48
Google gets me two things,  Bull stories (it's going to 1 million!) or bear stories (It's a bubble).   So I want the reasoning and logic from within the community. If I can't find educated opinions, then something tells me bitcoins price isn't built on anything but AIR. Or at the least, the **Greater Fool Theory**. 
You haven't presented well reasoned arguments. and I didn't want to take the time to refute them. But I could if you wanted to take them one by one. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:04:24
Have bitcoins ever been stolen? Then they're not "perfectly secure". What happens when miners aren't incentivized to mine anymore? Fees go up. Electricity costs go up . 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:25:43
so a bitcoin wallet on a flash drive can be erased and lost forever?  Why would anyone own that as opposed to other currencies?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:21:46
oh. so you agree that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. it's only value is what others are willing to pay for it. And that the Greater Fool Theory is in play. Awesome.  How will fees go down when it costs MORE to mine and there isn't a black reward anymore? In fact hasn't the block been halved already?  Wow. are all bitcoin speculators this dumb?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:14:23
You don't see that the number 1 comedy on television is doing storylines around this "secret" and yet you think that MORE people are going to know about it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:10
Futures markets are settled in CASH. my friend. Not bitcoin. No bitcoin is even TRADED. you obviously don't understand futures markets. Oil, nat gas, wheat and copper futures markets force traders to actually TAKE DELIVERY or store the commodity they're trading. Bitcoin is different, it's settle in cold hard American cash. It's basically fantasy football. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:11:47
and then everyone will be saying that 50k is next. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:29:19
Please explain to me what Bitcoins intrinsic value is.  thanks.  And your comment shows that you lack understanding of what an investment is. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:58
No. I just wanted answers and then I'd evaluate them in categories, such as A)Well reasoned B) Irrational Exuberance C) Ignorance. 
Your answers were in the "B" category. 
Of those 9 attributes, are any of the PATENTED?  If not, then what's stopping other cryptos from using them and improving on the transaction time and fees? 
Lastly, a cardinal rule of investing : Past results are NOT a guarantee of future performance.  Also, trees don't grow to the sky. 
You sound bitter. can you even entertain the possibility that you might be wrong? Or is Bitcoin your only experience with money and investing? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:37:13
1. thanks.
2. If there is a dispute over a transaction in Bitcoin, is there a way to get your money back? Is there fraud protection? What are the fees for bitcoin transactions? What are the fees to purchase bitcoins? What happens to bitcoin fees when the last coin is mined? 
Lastly, why can't they just invent PayPalCoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:10
You forgot to mention that after corrections it can take YEARS to achieve the previous highs. Look at the NASDAQ for example, which took 15 years to get back to it's bubble highs. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:19:15
without the decentralization, what's the point. I'll just use paypal. They have money back guarantees. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:11:07
so as the price goes up, and the coins increase in circulation, the FEES for transaction will go up as well?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:44:07
where should I purchase bitcoin then? Also then where should I store it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:15
Great post. Well thought out list of reasons not to own Bitcoin. Too many threats, and to easy to manipulate.  If you can manipulate a global currency with SPAM ,is it really stable? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:41:40
Traders who hold a short position in a physically settled security futures contract to expiration are required to make delivery of the underlying asset.  This case the underlying asset would be bitcoin. But that is not the case .  Oil, Gold, Wheat etc. have to take delivery. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:46
this is not a relevant example and why crypto "investors" aren't really true investors. they're speculators.

Amazon built something that others can't replicate. Can you say the same for bitcoin? Amazon is the most efficient at logistics. Is Bitcoin the most efficient crypto? If no to those 2 questions, then another crypto will replace it.

Coinbase is offline so that insiders can dump. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:12:29


actually the exact opposite. 
Intrinsic value is a things value outside of perceptions. It has measurable metrics. quantifiable. 
As coins get mined, won't fees go up? as electricity costs to mine go up?
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:24:54
guys. it's over. it's now a race to the bottom. there is no shame in selling
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:14
Fantasy football leagues are HUGE. And the analogy was that they operate the same way in respect to the actual NFL as Bitcoin futures do to actual bitcoin prices. No effect WHATSOEVER.   Bitcoin is nothing but a speculation vehicle right now. The swings are to big. The Futures market doesn't care, they just want the transaction fees. The fact that they still settle in cash instead, shows that Bitcoin isn't close to being ready for prime time. Especially when 40% of bitcoin is owned by 1000 people. Coinbase is down all the time, insider trading, front running and spoofing are rampant. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:26:56
MSFT and AMZN have intrinsic value. Bitcoin does not.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:16:06
It's all relative. Stocks represent a "share" in the companies assets, earnings, and profits.  Bitcoin has NO PROFITS, NO EARNINGS. No nothing. The only reason to buy is to sell it for more than you paid.  Boeing and General Electric have been around for DECAdes AND GROWING. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:07:48
As a professional investor, when the masses are aware , it's time to SELL. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:09:15
1. So those coins are lost forever?
2. When the masses of people are aware it's time to SELL.  The utility of Bitcoin seems to be to sell them to people at a higher price, or trade them for illegal items.  Any other utility can be done cheaper and better . 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:11:08
So once that wallet is lost or erased those bitcoins are lost forever?
In the sitcom the price they mentioned was $5000.  so yeah. My point is that whenever any investment goes mainstream it's time to SELL.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:21
You thought I was using big words? hahaha.  Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:31:50
wait. does that decentralized, fungible, unhackable, inclusive, borderless, trustless currency have to be bitcoin? does bitcoin have a patent on blockchain technology?  Is bitcoin cheap and have relative low fees?  will those fees go down or up when the last bitcoin is mined?   You sir, are shortsighted.   
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:07:57
1. So they lose that usb drive, they lose $Millions. wow. 
2. PayPal.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:01:34
This is lotto money. I expect to lose every dollar I put into crypto. But it's only a small % of my portfolio. It's just a little gamble. To ease the guilt I have of not mining 4 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:37:42
That's kind of my point. You're too close to crypto to see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:43:53
What's stopping other crypto's from taking Bitcoins marketshare?  What happens to fees when the last bitcoin is mined?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:17:20
it was rhetorical. There is NOTHING stopping more and more cryptos from meeting the demand. Which isn't good for Bitcoin because it doesn't have a patent on blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:18:23
haha. MSFT and AMZN  have intrinsic value.  Bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:28:28
stocks are valued also buy many many other metrics, such as assets, cashflow, earnings, inventory. etc.  Bitcoin has none of those things. Bitcoin seems to only be trading on a greater fool theory. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:04:58
no wifi, no bitcoin. no electric no bitcoin. Also, what is stopping other crypto currencies from replicating exactly the same things ? As soon as other cryptocurrencies  appear, then what? oops they already have. So VisaCoin? PayPalCoin? DisneyCoin? USFedCoin? yup. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:18:32
so greater fool theory. buy because someone else will pay you more later.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:07:00
Last nights. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:27:15
what happens when the last coin in mined? why would anyone mine?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:50:52
The name calling and crassness correctly puts your ilk in the same boat as classless asshats who don't know the first thing about investing, but instead are simply true believers in a pot of gold you think you found, and now all those fruitless years in front of the screen make you somehow validated to be an asshat to strangers seeking knowledge. But that's cool. I don't want a biased opinion from an ignoramus. save your response. I won't read it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:24:36
and the exchanges are unregulated wild west . hacked. manipulated. etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:24:38
Parabolic chart moves cant be sustained. duh.  I mined bitcoin at $200. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:13:31
what happens when the last coin is mined?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:45:56
it was down only 50% peak to trough.   You need some perspective. Nothing even during the Dot com bubble soared 7500%.  Bit coin is simply too volatile for the big league investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:57
What does FUD mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:00
1. 40% of the coins are owned by 100 people. That's not decentralized. 
2. I don't know what Donny Johnny has, but if he labels it a currency of Fascists it's in trouble. 
3.  So your slightly illegal business is favored by bitcoin owners. As fees rise, and better options are created, it seems that bitcoin will only be favored by those wishing to stay under the radar. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:55:19
Coinbase is 4% fee to purchase and 4% to sell. That's 8% fee for using bitcoin. Paypal is 3%.   Paypal has fraud protection. Bitcoin does not.  Can you explain how it's "better" ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:34:43
So there is no link between the price of Bitcoin and the futures market in terms of futures influences the price of actual bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-05-07 20:46:29
there seems to always be counter party risk. How do you determine the value of your coins if not for 3rd party? You don't get to set the value of them. So the price has to come from an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:45:59
But he makes less mistakes that way
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:22:38
Then you quickly realize that being your own bank is more complex and dangerous than you thought, and you decide to leave your funds on your exchange, which will manage your cryptos for you.
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:48:10
how is NOT being exposed to counterparty risk possible then?
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:07:16
What if the software that "proves reserves" is fraudulent? 
How do you never expose yourself to counter party risk?
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:44:58
Nothing is trustless. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:13:17
What I don't understand is why is the cost to mine even related to the market price for Bitcoins?  
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:10:20
so avoiding taxes is a positive? that's illegal. not a good start.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:29:06
meh. sounds like you're selling something that we don't need or isn't there. Also, why is bitcoin the only currency that can do this?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:52:55
ugh. more snake oil sales? cmon
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:35:32


Exactly, so it's not a real currency. It's a commodity. 


Doesn't make it the best. 


A good point, but how many people actually own the majority of bitcoins?  40% owned by 1000 people.  


I'm not sure how I feel on this one. On one had, you're right. On the other, once the last coin is mined. Fees will HAVE to go up. 


Meh. First movers can always get disrupted. 


Does not eliminate competition. 
Thanks for your insight. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:51:47
oil is priced in USD. Gold is not an investment it's a store of value, and now you're saying that bitcoin isn't a currency either, it's a commodity. so let's be clear. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:50:09
Not sure if you can buy a pizza with gold. 
Also, why Bitcoin over any of the 1500 other crypto's? They all have similar traits. So WHY should I choose bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:02:33
no. I prefer cash and credit. it works well.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:52:38
Oh geeze. You expected a 75% crash?  You guys keep repeating the same mantra. over and over. When something is built on air it will collapse under it's own weight. This ain't my first rodeo but it's obvious that most holders have never owned a commodity before.  So let me repeat and spell it out for you. There is no *intrinsic* value to BTC, therefor the price is completely, 100% , arbitrary.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:44:17
Semantics. There are "safe" places, unless you are claiming in the broadest sense of the word that GOLD isn't going to be gold in some possible future event. Even though it's held value for 5000 years. 
What is the 'Risk-Free Rate Of Return' [Link](
The three-month U.S. Treasury bill is a useful proxy because the market considers there to be virtually no chance of the government defaulting on its obligations. 
In Gambling, the odds are not fixed in all games. Poker, had very volatile odds. And the House isn't even playing against you. Even Black Jack has odds that shift in the players favor.
If 9/10 startups fail, those represent clear "odds against you" in having investment gains.  
You clearly think you know more about investing than any professional, and we haven't discussed risk tolerance.  That's wasn't the point.  But for the average investor, cryptos are gambling. And you can find much better risk /reward structures outside of crypto. 
But if you're inclined to take higher risks, aka gamble, then go for it. There ARE people who win in Vegas.  Just like crypto millionaires. But please stop comparing cryptos to equities. they are very different.
Lastly, cryptos in relation to equities, have no inherent value. Whereas equity shares represent a share of a companies earnings/assets, cryptos have NO EARNINGS to share. They only have a price that is mutually agreed upon by a market place. Gold also shares this aspect. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, it doesn't sell anything, it has no assets that it owns, unlike Apple . Which owns real estate,  sells software, hardware and intellectual property. And those things can be measured. Bitcoin does or has none of that.  And it's not healthy for average people to invest in it when much better alternatives exist. Such as scratch off tickets.

Visa and Mastercard are already sent through the internet. I just want to know what's BETTER about Bitcoin than our current system. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:36:59
Eth is backed by the etherium network. But you make a great argument for blockchain technology, but not any one crypto coin. Hope you get my  point now.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:28:46
How many cryptos are there now 1300? And the odds of you picking 1 out of 1300 is far longer than the 1 out of 38 spaces on Roulette.

You do know that Bitcoin transaction take an enormous amount of energy and time. This is a detraction from the platform. What gives bitcoin value is that people place their money into it and trust it. Once people stop doing that, it loses value, just like gold.

@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:49
I like your screen name. It seems that this is your best advice.  Historical performance is NOT a predictor of future gains. Period. Looking at the intrinsic worthlessness of Bitcoin should be strongly considered before placing your hard earned dollars into this .  Every single person and comment on here only offers the Greater Fool Theory for buying BTC. period. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:48:07
why is Bitcoin the only currency that can do this?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:27:36
It's interesting to note that there seems to be NO agreement or even understanding of how the entire process works. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:33:36
I'm sorry, but you seem to be confused. The link you gave me talked about putting your money where it is safe. Cryptocurrencies have proven that your money is not SAFE in them.  From hacking to volatility. 
I may not understand the protocol. But I have 20 years investing experience. I'm only trying to help you keep your money and make it last longer. Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:44:13
If Bitcoin is a currency, then it should be allowed to act like one. You can take a cash advance on a credit card. But you can't take a bitcoin advance? Then it's not a currency. Stocks, bond, mutual funds don't claim to be a currency. 
The other reason for the fuss is that this further undermines public acceptance and faith in bitcoin as something other than a ponzi scheme. If my ways of buying and selling it are now even more limited, why would I get into this at all?
Be very suspicious of people who only give advice on Bitcoin that builds upon the *Greater Fool Theory* of investments. If they cannot offer any other reasons for owning beside that, then stay away. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:24:16
You're advice is in question. Are you drunk right now?  You shouldn't be allowed to manage other people's money. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:09:01
what happens when fees get to high for people in those limited areas?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:21:09
No. I don't think I have missed the point then.
You're saying that the only way bitcoin works beyond the last mining is if everyone in society chooses to replace the dollar with it.  
So far, I'm leaning to side with Jamie Dimon that it's a fraud with a ticking time bomb .
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:28:52
That one person can affect the market by 75% just illustrates the instability of Bitcoin and it's one of the many reasons that most don't trust it for their currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:22:25
I'm all for the idealist vision of transparency etc. But bitcoin is anonymous. It's the currency of choice for criminals and hackers and ransomware. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:03:20
Exactly, once JMP has blockchain running in their system, and WellFargo has their own, and BofA their own, and then Disney has their own, then what's the point? Only criminals will own BTCs and the Gov't cracks down and squashes demand. Poof. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:00:44
More places adopting isn't the solution if those places then cannot get their dollars back from suppliers or banks. Ultimately the banks have to backstop cryptos. Or else you're just trading tokens. If Best Buy says they accept BTCs but then can't get those BTCs converted to dollars, they'll quit accepting them.  
BTCs don't seem like an investment to me by definitions. You're using the "greater fool theory" of investing then.
JPM doesn't need mass adoption to supplant BTC. They just need Wells Fargo to have their own and BofA and Disney and Uber and then what? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:25:15
So, I'm just a BTC dummy here. So a couple of dumb questions.  
1. What happens when all the BTCs are mined?
2. Where will the motivation be to keep the ledger?
Maybe a little better understanding there would help me.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:16:47
I'm curious. Does anyone still believe in the fraud that is bitcoin? or is it really just a misplaced hope that blockchain will dethrone the banking system? Because bitcoin itself isn't that great of a technology. there are better coins out there. This comic is making fun of those that HODL. Because they are blind.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:26:59
you're describing "speculating", not investing.   Speculation is simply holding an asset in anticipation of someone else paying more in the future for it. With no intrinsic value to the asset. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Unlike an investment in a stock such as Amazon, or Boeing. Or a real estate asset.

You are correct. and we are closer to an understanding except for this: 
(fiat currency, with no intrinsic value).
Fiat currencies have the taxing authority and military authority of the governments it is issued by as intrinsic value.  Crypto does not. has nothing. it's more akin to GOLD than anything else. which is that it's ONLY value is that society must agree it's worth something.

If fees continue to rise (which they must after block rewards are gone), this will be a discouragement to users. The only users left will be criminals. If fees remain low, then it forces miners to survive on low fees alone, discouraging miners.

viewing crypto as an "investment" and being a HODLer is a contradiction.  HODLers are not investors. Investors goal is to make money, not lose it. HODLers don't care about making money, or they would have sold when the prices spiked 10,000%.

You seem to like to just restate the obvious.
Gold produces NOTHING. It does not create wealth by itself. Unlike Apple or Google, or Boeing. These assets *CREATE* wealth and things. Their value is intrinsic to what they create and produce and provide to society. A block of shiny Gold cannot create anything. 
"Most" modern currencies? why not ALL? Fiat currencies are backed by something, the taxing authority, the military power of the United States for instance, gives it a value intrinsic to it. 
Bitcoin is digital with NO backing of anything whatsoever. No support, nothing but the HODLs..... it's a joke. It's headed to ZERO.

Oh. you're right. In less than a decade, hackers have stolen $1.2 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether, two of the most popular digital currencies. A security hole in the Parity Wallet resulted in losses of about $155 million, including in Ether and other tokens.Just minutes after CoinDash’s launch of an initial coin offering, hackers made off with as much as $6.6 million worth of Ether. Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a leaderless venture-capital fund and what was then the highest-profile project using Ethereum, was hacked. About $50 million of members’ contributions to the fund were siphoned off.Hong Kong-based Gatecoin had about $2 million in Bitcoin and Ether stolen following a cyber attack.
NONE of this was insured for members or owners. Unlike at a normal bank where you are not held personally liable.

BTCs price spikes are predicated on mass adoption, not mass banning. 
Massive fees will drive away legit transactions and only appeal to illegal ones.  With no incentive to mine, and no incentive to transact, where does BTC get it's demand. Criminal activity. Done.
SMFH; If all the BTC exchanged announced that your coins had been "lost" in another raid. right now. what would you do?  Bitcoin, like Gold, Yen, Dollars, Looneys, is a currency that only has value because people decide it does. The reason the dollar has the strongest value is because of people's trust in it. If people do not trust a currency, it's value plummets. Bitcoin is NO DIFFERENT in that respect.   Bitcoin is like chuck-e-cheese tokens. One day, you'll wake up and realize that they're only good for the germ infested emporium that issued them.   Just  because you   have a little knowledge of computers and blockchain, does not make you a currency expert or an investment guru.  
Bitcoin is a giant Tulip fad and the only investment theory it's trading on is called "The greater fool theory" google it. And learn something. Hope this helps bruh.

Second. It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity. Is Coinbase trustworthy?  What software do YOU use to convert your bitcoin ?  Why has so much bitcoin (hundreds of millions) been stolen if Decentralization builds so much trust?
*next*. Auditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed — that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars.
And to Keep your Overseas Aid records in a tamper-proof
repository not owned by "anyone” sounds right — yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his aid has been recieved? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party — like the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the aid or providing the software?

Two economists in a London hedgefund. Using the Quantity Theory of Money, Irving Fisher, 1911.   MV=PQ 
M is the mount of currency in circulation
V is the money's velocity or how often it actually changes hands
P is the price
Q is the value of what it buys. 
So P=MV/Q
at the time of their paper, it was 15 million coins changing hands 4 times per year. or P=0.05 
That's the number of bitcoins to a dollar.  
Do you have a better way to value it?

I didn't say it was stolen from blockchain. You've missed my point. My point is that blockchain does not exist in a vacuum of perfect space. to function in REAL society it requires the same amount of trust that current systems do.  And that trust has already been violated. 
You're defending blockchain as if it was still a theoretical paper. Not actually working in reality. And in reality we see that it's not a better system at all.  And even if you could lay out a very long winded answer to why you think it IS better, the debate shows that it's at best, marginally better. Which doesn't argue well for turning the entire system upside down. We already have an anonymous way to make transactions, it's call CASH. 


Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When the seller
proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon price, and that the item — rather than some other file, or nothing at all — will actually arrive. The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed — that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal 50 million dollars. But yours wont. It’s not trustless, you’re trusting in the software (and your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting other people.
In the end you have to rely on one of four things,
each of them characteristics of the “old way”: 
either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and trust, the seller of the item has a reputation to uphold, you or friends of yours have bought items from this seller in the past successfully, or you’re just willing to hope that this person will deal fairly. In each case, even if the transaction is effectuated
via a smart contract, in practice you’re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself.

 The GDPR is designed so that organizations will store the  data of EU citizens and residents within the EU and not across thousands of decentralized nodes throughout the globe. Moreover, the GDPR assumes a world in which corporate leaders are responsible for implementing regulatory standards.

What about the trust you must place in the software? Like Coinbase? Or the software that was exploited for over $50 million last year? Unless you're going to not trust them, so you right your OWN code right?  Somewhere along the bitcoin exchange, you HAVE to trust other humans. period.

If Bitcoin is "trustless" then you have to explain the software you use and TRUST to exchange your bitcoin every day. to process your transactions, and why and HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS in bitcoin have been stolen from exchanges that people trusted. Is coinbase trust-less? 
You'll always need to trust a 3rd party to exchange your coins. Or store parts of the ledger on THEIR computers. Unless you write your own code . 
Blockchains "value proposition" is different from it's technology is. It's value prop is : "What if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?" and it's technology is : "a very long sequence of small fies — each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data, and the answer to a difficult math problem — and divide up some money every hour among anyone willing to certify and store those iles for us on their computers."
It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.

Except they are needed for blockchain. And when they are hacked, it hurts everyone who owns Bitcoin. Unlike when a bank is is robbed it only hurts the bank, not my account. 


So you have to trust that other persons software. 


Unlike most people. Who don't buy anything with it anymore. 


Who wrote the code for your wallet? Did you? Then you're trusting a 3rd party. 


$300 million has been stolen so far. And huge amounts of fraudulent activity propping it up as well. Please don't use the word "foulproof". 
A decentralized, tamper-proof repository sounds like a great way to audit where your mango comes from, how fresh it is, and whether it has been sprayed with pesticides or not. But actually, laws on food labeling, nonproft or government inspectors, an independent, trusted free press, empowered workers who trust whistleblower protections, credible grocery stores, your local nonproWt farmer’s market, and so on, do a way better job.
