Well thank you very much! Glad you gave a nice and gentle comment to a noob.
And that is what I figured a deal like that would be. Shame I didn't get in earlier.

Let me go check.
Edit: Confirmed

Another mathematics major here. The only thing I love more than math is getting paid for it.

Hence why ATF exists and smuggled cigarettes are so illegal with a lot of the trafficking taking place in New York. But to be honest, you only really make money off of it in bulk, and in such a high volume it is rather easy to track.
I guess what I am saying is don't keep your hopes up for a cola black market.

You could make a pure math one, just saying :p
I know I would love to help people with combinatorics and abstract.

It shouldn't be, considering the origin of the term is from colonial America.

Campaign donations.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:51:27
I mean seriously though, untraceable donations that can't quite be reported. Perfect way to buy out an election.

To be fair, optimization for CUDA cores would be awesome. As an nvidia user I would appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:20:05
Yep, that is what I have done.
Am I wrong do believe that this can help people in DNS blocked countries?
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:59:44
These look beyond awesome. If I had anything worth tipping then I would.

Unfortunately there isn't the satisfaction of making it rain 20's. Though I guess you could tuck paper wallets and whatnot.

'Personal Investment' they made with initial capital from an 'offshore account'.

Kink.com would like to have a word with you.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:19:05
Huh, that is really neat! Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:17:19
Well yes, but still not physical.

True, but people such as yourself are the foundation of bitcoin. Without people sacrificing their time and money this economy wouldn't work.
In other words, it is the miners that we have to thank for all of this.
Any tips on Namecoin? It seems interesting and worth pursuing.

Yep, apple cider vinegar doused handkerchiefs are excellent on nullifying tear gas.
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:05:50
Ah, fair enough. I just started out the other day, hence my ignorance.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:36:53
Well of course. But I was specifically talking about graphics cards.
Edit: My reasoning is that while BFL is neat, it cannot be used in an academic field like my computer is. So a graphics card would be of more use to me.
