There is no central bitcoin bank so the comparison is a little hard to make. I think the point is bitcoin itself has never been hacked. It is money and a way to safely to store that money at the same time. Central bitcoin institutions and block chain should not be used anyway.

No, I'm saying she didn't need to give him 2 life sentences. Under guidelines she could give him only 20 years if she wanted to but she chose to give him 2 life sentences to set an example.

I think john should just give him 10k out his own pocket. That sounds like a plausible situation without anything terribly off. It was may 18th when he put the fucking order in!

The judge chose to give him a long sentence. She could have gave him only 20 under federal guidelines.

Who cares what people at coinbase ect do. Bitcoin is controlled by the people not them. I can send store and receive from whoever I want.

Hundreds/thousads of pieces of evidence. I don't recall that much. I read through all of it. They had chat logs that there were all anonymous and easily faked. What third party provider are you speaking of? They already had access to the silkroad servers months before Ross was arrested. The could easily login to an admin page for a picture. Also even if they caught him logged on that doesn't prove that he ran silkroad the whole time or even ran it at all. There was nothing provable beyond a reasonable doubt. Lets not forget how biased the judge was against him as well suppressing evidence. She was determined to make an example. He was guilty before he even entered the court room.

What this article is talking about is people who are buying spice ect. from headshops and gas stations. That stuff comes from china. They don't use bitcoin to get it. Maybe 1/10000 or something use bitcoin out of the total legal drug trade. It didn't effect the price.

I know how plea deals work. She still did not have to give him 2 life sentences as you seem to be suggesting.  She did it to set an example. The guidlines say 20 min....If he accepted the plea deal he could have got off with less than 20...20 is the min if he didn't accept the plea deal. The guy that ran sr2 only got 5 years....
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:05:23
Sorry, I see now. Very sketchy indeed. I also like how they used the wording of "up to" meaning they probably have no where near that amount.

congrats on the pro hold. many people can't do that.
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:43:49
Of course. That doesn't mean he needs to be given 2 life sentences because he wanted to go to trail....

This is just because more people are making transactions and more people have no idea what they are doing. If you pay the correct fee your transaction will more than likely be confirmed in a timely manner.

You said that they got him with his laptop open.I asked Were you there? These agents have shown to be corrupt time and time again. How do we even know they caught him with anything open on his laptop? That could have easily been planted.  Not much work for how many bitcoins they seized. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 14:01:34
It has been shown the the fbi has a way to de anonymize tor users and hack into their computer. They did it with CP suspects. I'm not sure why it is beyond a reasonable doubt that evidence was planted. The only way they let him go is if someone else confesses. They don't care about evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  At least more know about bitcoin.

wtf is going on. bitcoin ceo, we need a statement.

He denied sending the chats and I doubt he would send a message over google chat to someone saying he is running silk road. The creator and operator of silk road must have known a lot about security to operate for so long without being caught. I can't remember where the evidence list is at but there are summaries of it on news sites. I'm sure if you google you can find it. So much of the "evidence" had nothing to directly do with ross anyway. Like there were pills listed that were delievered to someone who was arrested and tried to say that was evidence ross caused someone to be arrested. Each chat message is listed as a seperate piece of evidence as well.

"who deny access to location data for smartphone apps because they don’t feel like sharing their location with ad networks. " "but I'm not hiding anything so I don't have anything to worry about" said the person who just had their dog shot by a swat team for using a vpn to watch a canadian show.
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:56:32
Well, one of the agents on the case was arrested for stealing bitcoins. He was also the one who created the fake murder that Ross apparently hired. There is no proof at all. Ross might be the only one that knows if he ordered to have anyone killed. oh also all charges were dropped on the murder charges

If you tell your local cop someone broke into your house and have video proof they will probably spend an hour on it and forget. If you tell them someone is growing a plant in their backyard; they might send helicopters and a swat team to shoot your dog.

coinbase could start acting like paypal and randomly decide you are not allowed to your coins for whatever reason they see fit.

I never said he was innocent or am I implying he is innocent. I'm talking about the judge tossing evidence. If the FBI can't prove how they obtained evidence legally it should not be able to be used in court....Future innocent people could just be thrown in jail and they would not need to prove anything.

everyone can use it in some way. it doesn't matter if one only owns 0.000001 bitcoin when the price is very high. also  if someone is using it to transfer value and not trying to make money from speculating...the price doesn't matter
