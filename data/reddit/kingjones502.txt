Agreed it's cliche. But doesn't make it any less true. Being pessimistic isn't gonna help the situation. I believe in this so I stay positive until 2020. If we're still here then I'll join the pity party

These dips don't even hurt anymore. It's cool how after a while you get numb to it. I think I'm more confident than ever that the rise of Bitcoin and crypto is inevitable

Be patient. All in due time. The tech is there. The companies and partnerships are coming in. Don't expect to get rich like people who got in 8 years ago in just a few months. It will take time but it's a given that Blockchain and DLT are here to stay and progressing at a very rapid rate. Most of us are putting in money and just waiting to get rich. Can't be mad that it's taking a little too long lol. I actually feel like this is just a period of big money taking time and strategizing how they will use the crypto space. Wall street guys and large corporations don't just their money around. They are planning and strategizing. Too many big names coming in for crypto to fail. Not sure which coins will be the winners in the long run but we are past the days of 100 percent faith in the dollar and big banks. Strong hands will look back and be grateful they held on. And what has been happening lately is much more realistic and sustainable than December 2017. I want my gains to stay not come and go. So hopefully this is just big money waiting to pick where they want to invest and making smart decisions. I could do without the fomo pump and dumps anyway. I'll bet the gains come after consensus when everyone has heard most of the different pitches and find good entry points for coins they like.

I think it's safe to say we have bought many dips. At some point you get tired of seeing the money you just put in today go away tomorrow as if it never even happened. From percentage losses its too late for me to pull out now. Moon or bust. But unless you are shorting the market you are probably a little sick today

Am I the only one that has a problem tethering? I'm always scared I'll miss the moon so I end up riding the downwave. Any suggestions on getting my trading emotions in check?
