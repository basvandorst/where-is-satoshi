It just went down around 14.5k again.

I mean I'm hodling but "the end of the dip" has been thrown around a lot today.

Kind of a mean thing to do, but you do you.

I mean, I don't think any whales in btc really care about a $3k dip. It's up how much year to date? Certainly not enough to actively coordinate to inflate it a couple thousand dollars. Honestly Ver is a nut, but he's pretty masterful if he really did win coinbase and msnbc before this latest bch pump.

That's what happened to me in 2012.

Are you saying trolling is fun? Because clearly you have no money invested. Investments are fun. You should try that. Way more returns.

We will all remember the great crypto crash of 2017. God, BCH was supposed to be the chosen one and it's still tumbling like a fat boy off an icy mountain face. I just realized I had some from credited from before the fork, and even that free share is painful to watch.

I wouldn't. Roger Ver is inevitably going to go buck wild at the next BTC mining difficulty increase and get everybody to pump the hell out of bcash. He does it like clock work. When it gets painfully inflated, do it then.

Yeah I feel the same. I wish I could by now, no liquid to convert to btc.

Did he end up ok?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:54:24
It's really nice, but I don't wanna spend $50 now that's gonna be $150 later.

It would hurt to know buying a game two years ago would be worth like $2000 now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:24:53
Where can I find a chart analysis?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:35:48
Can you fill me in on the type of pattern we are looking at right now?
