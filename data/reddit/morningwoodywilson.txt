Since when has “close all my positions at market close” been a valid market strategy? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:42
What...? If this question sounded reasonable to you, I promise investing in bitcoin is a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:15:58
You mean the economy? The stock market? Real estate? Profit taking means others put money in. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:24:39
Notice I didn’t mention Facebook. Stock in Microsoft purchased for $1000 at IPO would be worth close to a million now. 
Again though, just because it’s more volatile doesn’t change the fact that profit taking equals loss to others. Investing has always been like that. To liquidate, somebody has to buy your shit. For massive volatility, have you ever heard of stock options? Even higher risk/rewards than current btc movement. 
I’m not saying bitcoin is identical to all other investing, but the guy I’m responding to is somehow suggesting that profit taking == Ponzi scheme, which is silly.

Gemini has proved itself far more reliable, imo.

Can you explain how politics, in your strange mind, have been twisted into a podesta vs Trump situation? What if I dislike both? Do I support child murder?

We are talking about bitcoin money, meaning you don’t have disposable income for the foreseeable future that even close to matches this windfall. If you’re fresh out of law school and you have 200k guaranteed annually, it’s a different story. This is the exact mentality of “hood rich”, “dumb rich”, or whatever you want to call it. 
A million isn’t that much money. Payments are more expensive than cash, which this hypothetical person has an excess of. An older r8 will cost thousands and thousands a year to maintain, insure, and god forbid, repair. 
Buy a used m3 for 20-30k, cash. It’ll be way cheaper to maintain, still fun, and be way less financially damaging. Windfalls should be invested or used to buy something that won’t depreciate at 10% a year. Like, maybe a house, the thing millennials are always complaining is unrealistic. And real estate is great to buy in cash, cause house payments are a bitch, and interest adds up quickly on high value, long term loans. 
Like honestly, most older adults I know drive Tesla’s with their 5-10 million networths. Ostentatious shit like this is for when you have fuck you money, not a couple hundred grand. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:04
That’s literally a million dollars now... damn. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:44:49
What about an 80k car doesn’t scream millionaire? If more than 10% of your net worth is tied up in an expensive car, you’re a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:26:40
No, you were calling it a Ponzi scheme. That word has a real definition, and btc doesn’t fit it. It may be a bubble, idk. But it’s not a Ponzi, and zero sum game doesn’t imply that. Investment has always been like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:21:31
I’m aware, but bitcoin in its current state is treated as a store of value, similar to a commodity like gold. 
I understand the possibilities of bitcoin and what I hope it becomes, assuming bitcoin gets its shit together and finds a better solution to its problems than the optional segwit. But, at the moment, it would be laughable to use btc as a day to day currency, unless you’re using a btc debit card. But that’s not really using any of btc’s unique technology, so idk how I feel about that. 
My point was just that selling something to someone that speculated the value will rise, does not a Ponzi scheme make. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:24:02
No it doesn’t, and again, not how Ponzi schemes work. Please explain how other commodity trades are not Ponzi schemes. If you buy a bitcoin, somebody sold their bitcoin. Ponzi schemes imply the older investors are paid returns/dividends with new investors’ money, without requiring them to cash out. 
Bitcoin is just simple supply and demand. If people didn’t want to buy bitcoins, they wouldn’t do it. They aren’t being lied to about what it is, and they can sell it and recoup at least most of their money. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:06:28
Edit: the main difference is other commodities had to be bought a while ago, and had higher price thresholds. My parents made a shit load of money buying real estate when it was cheap after the crash, but most kids that use Reddit didn’t have the disposable income to buy a couple houses in 2008. Btc is posted about because the people that won off this investment vehicle are mainly internet kids that use Reddit. If you want me to consolidate a list of all investments that changed peoples lives/made them rich, let me know and I’ll start writing. 
That’s because people don’t really buy or sell literal gold, but plenty of day traders have lost or gained millions trading gold futures, leveraged etf’s, etc. Literally go read a wallstreetbests thread about jnug/jdst, 3x leveraged bearish and bullish gold etf’s. 
Markets are primarily zero sum games, as cashing out requires a buyer. Have you heard of people getting rich buying Tesla, Microsoft, google, or other hugely pumped tech stocks? This isn’t unique to btc.

That was a blunt, which you definitely do inhale. 
But ya, a real cigar should never be inhaled into the lungs. You puff them, drawing the smoke into the mouth and immediately exhaling it. You will get incredibly sick if you inhale a cigar like a cigarette.

Is balsamic on steak a thing, or just a personal preference? I can’t imagine it being bad, but I’ve just never seen or heard the combo.

You are claiming to be an Oracle though. You’re spouting bs. I believe in bitcoin, and hope it rises. But you’re claiming nonsense with no real factual grounding. Btc could lose the war, there are other cryptos. And waning public interest will make bitcoin drop in price, that’s not a good sign. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:06:29
That’s a terrible idea, Jesus Christ no. 
Bitcoin isn’t a certain thing, that’s why we all say to not invest more than you can afford to lose. Crypto currency will undoubtedly succeed in my mind, but the odds that bitcoin is the overall winner is possible, but not close to 100%. 
As stated further up, student loans are a lifelong thing, no matter what. Do not bet on bitcoin with student loans. Minimize your debt obligations, invest internship and side job income into bitcoin if you can afford it, but focus on coming out of university with no debt. Risky gambles are awesome only if they work out. Sound financial responsibility is far less sexy, but much less likely to put you in a fiscal situation inescapable by anything outside of death.

I know. I was saying “thank god for people like you” as in, you’re one of the few voices of sanity in this thread. Wasn’t meant as an attack, it was a compliment.

Because hotel management’s a great career, and a degree from the top hospitality management programs. Not sure on how NYU stands, but it’s a pretty relaxed way of making 6 figures or more, all things considered. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:08:30
Thank god for people like you on this sub. I get optimism, but arguing that betting student loan debt on bitcoin’s success is asinine. What if btc goes to zero and etherium becomes the coin of choice? Live under crushing student loan debt until you die? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:09:19


You're right, but from my hospitality major friends, I've heard that it's a much better job than banking or law in terms of intensity and hours. Same way I'd say software engineering is a relaxed way to make 6 figures.

Yes but now, at worst, he’s upper middle class with a good career and no debt, and at best he’ll hop back on the crypto train and be very wealthy. You seem to be underestimating how crushing student loan debt can be for the average American. Financial success is all about making safe bets, and only going for broke with what you can afford to lose. If his strategy went to shit he’d be in a far worse place than he is now. The winning coin a decade from now could be yet to be created for all we know. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:19:41
I’m not at all. My money is broken up between equity in private companies, stocks and bonds, and a few cryptos. I am just saying that even owning a couple of the top coins isn’t a sound investment strategy, and investing in something like a debt free NYU degree in a solid field like hospitality is a very safe bet. 
Being right on crypto is no easy task. There’s no way to know if this guy would be right 10 years from now, but there’s also nothing to stop him from reinvesting, now that he’s covered all of his largest costs in life for the foreseeable future. He won’t miss the ship if he buys back in over the next year or two. If he’s as good as he thinks he is with crypto investing, he’ll still be a rich man. If he’s not as good as he’s been to this point, it was smart to cash out.
