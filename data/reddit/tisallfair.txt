While true, other exchanges have advantages like greater liquidity, leverage, &gt;1BTC transaction limit, immediate transaction times, and a bunch of other functionality. OP should weigh up all options.

Depends on what you want to do with the Bitcoin.
If you want to trade for profit I'd recommend Kraken. Some of their code is open source, fees are low, good leadership transparency (they post often to reddit), has most major fiat and crypto pairs, excellent pro trader functionality.
If you want Bitcoin for everyday purchases then Bitsquare.io is the way to go. Lowest fees you'll find.
If you're a privacy enthusiast then Local Bitcoins combined with conversion into DASH or Monero.
To paraphrase Andreas Antonopoulos, there's no single best exchange, only a best exchange for a specific use case.
Edit: need to learn how to spell.
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:57:43
While you can do that all on Kraken at 0.26% per trade I'm not sure why you would. If that specific order matters then you should check out Shapeshift.io.

I don't think it's a reasonable claim to say the LN is right here, right now when Elizabeth Stark is telling people that even her developers are still losing money on it and that it is very ill advised to use LN on the main-net. Blockstream then reversed their position in recommending people to use LN, instead posting on their store that it is for demonstration purposes only. At best you could say that LN is in alpha.
Regarding Schnorr signatures, again, super exciting technology that I hope is rolled out in BCH too. However, just like LN, it's not production ready yet and so my arguments against LN apply equally to SS.
Regarding SW, I find it alarming that two(?) years after activation it still has marginal adoption. Why is that? Could it be that 85% of merchants and providers are malicious or lazy or stupid? Maybe. But then if not a strict flaw in the functionality of the code then it's a flaw in the leadership of Blockstream or a flaw in ease of implementation, which are things you need to take seriously when you want people to cooperate. I suspect the reason is because companies only have limited resources and can't afford the technical overhead to prioritise SW support in the face of unprecedented demand for bitcoin-related services. Blockstream probably should have opted for the SWHF option.

It's not my banking I've had trouble with. It's the banking of Australian crypto exchanges who keep getting their accounts closed. Happens all the time here. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:36:57
The underlying principle of BCH isn't to increase blocks forever. The guiding principle is that we pick the lowest hanging fruit to address the scaling issues we face today, rather than trying to pick future winners and cripple today's performance. When we cripple performance today we lose users today, which is a blow to Metcalf's law. We're not opposed to 2nd layer technologies. Lightening Network in principle sounds great but it's been 6 months away for the last two years. I feel like it's an unacceptable risk to put all of our $B eggs in one scaling solution basket. 
For the sake of argument, what happens if LN never solves the routing problem? What if it never achieves significant user adoption for whatever reason? What will BTC do then? 
Ninja edit: I think it's a bit rich for a BTC supporter to talk about the "clogging" of the BCH mempool during a stress test when all transactions were promptly cleared and fees never rose above 5s/b. I don't think I need to contrast that against the state of the BTC mempool for you to agree.

Full disclosure: I'm a big advocate of BCH. Not meaning to brigade here but I'm happy to have a good faith discussion if you like.
I think a key distinction between Bitconnect and Bitcoin Cash communities is that BCH is fully functional as a medium of exchange today and the rapidly increasing merchant adoption is a consequence of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:20:45
Sure, but transactions like these are common for merchants who receive thousands of inputs, which makes commerce untenable for them. And the issue is that if Bitcoin can't be used for commerce then the value proposition starts to get very shakey.

Yeah, that's kind of my point. Australia has an oligopoly of banks. There's the big 4 (ANZ, NAB, Westpac, and Commonwealth) and a handful of small ones. We can't just go to a crypto friendly bank.

I'd like to make a technical correction, if I may, that the collusion must happen between most *node operators* and a supermajority of those colluding nodes must signal a block &gt;1MB for there to be any material effect.
I understand that most nodes belong to miners but this distinction allows regular people like you and me a vote as opposed to no vote at all.

As part of the set up process you will need to physically write down twelve words. Store these words in a security deposit box or a safe or wherever else you think is secure. These words can be used to regenerate your wallet from anywhere with an internet connection, regardless of whether you have another Trezor device.

I'm looking at my list right now and there are 12 words. I've regenerated my wallet multiple times with success. Also, I don't know how a Trezor manages to store the details of every current wallet if it doesn't have an internet connection.

Running BU at this stage only signals that you are prepared to adjust what size block you are willing to accept and propagate. That can include raising it to 2MB, remaining at 1MB, or even lowering to 0.3MB as Luke Dashjr has proposed. As a miner you are only going to mine blocks as large as you think the network will accept. So if the majority of nodes will only accept 1MB then you are wasting your resources trying to propagate a 2MB block. The 75% activation point is only a predicted value where if one mines a big block there's a good enough chance that the block will be propagated. At which point, any remaining Core nodes will be forced to either switch to BU or reject the block and fork to a new chain.
This means from the perspective of a BU node, there is no hard fork and consequently, the concept of an activation period doesn't apply.

The implications of the attack largely depend on what the attackers are trying to do. Are they changing the transaction history? If so, they will need to go back in the blockchain and work forward faster than the rest of the network in order to catch up to the present. Remember, nodes will only validate the longest chain. The amount of energy required to change the ledger increases exponentially with distance from the present. With the energy you expend amending the blockchain, you could have spent on just regular mining so there's a significant opportunity cost too. [This podcast]( brilliantly illustrates just how monumental a task it is to achieve such an attack. Because of this, a 51% attack is of little concern to the community.
But say instead the attackers are just changing the client or PoW algorithm. What can you do to stop them? Well, nothing and it's also nothing to worry about. In fact, it's already happening with Classic and Unlimited attempting to change the block size and governance rules. In the event that a fork happens you just use the client you prefer and both implementations go their separate ways. You will have lost nothing and worst case scenario the network doubles its block generation time until the difficulty readjusts.

Exchanges charge a premium to withdraw (partially to discourage using them as a hot wallet, partially to compensate for low trading fees). They also have static fees so it does nothing to wait until there is less congestion. They also likely don't use recently enabled SegWit which is much cheaper than regular transactions.

For as long as miners are prepared to mine the legacy chain, technically yes. However, with only 17% of the hashing power it will take a prohibitively long time to reach the next difficulty adjustment period. This means scarcely any transactions can happen, the subsequent value of the chain will approach zero, and then any remaining miners will switch to the functional, dominant, profitable, forked chain. Your coins on the legacy chain will then cease to exist.

You can't move coins from one chain to another, they're an intrinsic part of whatever chain they belong to. You will need to buy the coins you want using the coins you don't by using an exchange like Kraken, Shapeshift, or Local Bitcoins.

Don't use Coinbase. They won't give you access to your BCC. Even if you just want to immediately sell it, it's still worth something. Go with Kraken or another supporting exchange. If you must use Coinbase, immediately withdraw your bitcoin to your own wallet (preferably a hardware wallet but it's unlikely that you could get one before Aug 1). If you own the keys to BTC then you also own BCC.
