He rent's them out for income, and compounds the earnings into his next investment property.  
He's not going from home to home with fatherless 'bitches' trashing them nightly with the insane posse party like trashy TV makes you think is 'normal' behavior.
He lives like he's poor, with 6 poor homes.  Granted, if you never enjoy life then what's the point?  But you can't be young, foolish and reckless forever and expect to be 'comfortable'.

Not quite, you don't control the means of production, as our student of Economics stated.  You're pretty much living of the interest of your investment, or earning a paycheck... sort of.  
Controlling the 'means to produce' means you own Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or even smaller localized construction companies that make things.
'Production' is what makes a nation.  Compare China (it makes everything and you should visit to see it) to Africa (makes what? But sells diamonds and stuff)

Yeah, the Internet changed a lot once the corps and the government started stuffing it's once blunt nose into it, so now backdoors and corporate spies are interwoven.
BitCoin and such are skipping along on twinkle toes today, yet all the big players are behind Ethereum, including Russia, so it's pretty clear they have a plan.
They have the army, they have the money, they are switching to Ethereum too, so I'm not going to rush into this bubble believing the cry of 'FREEDOOOOM'!!!!
