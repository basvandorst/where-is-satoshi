Okay sounds good, currently made a ticket to both poloniex and arin.net (where the chain led me) hopefully some positive results come back, cheers for the help bud!

I'll open a ticket, I tried speaking to some admins on poloniex but they said they can't do anything about it... Maybe they were just being lazy since it was late, thank you all for your suggestions, it means alot and I'm not just saying that!

Nah dude, it was just sent to the address in poloniex, it did say clearly that only fdlc should be sent but I was off in my own little place, I'm sure if the person is kind enough they might stumble upon this, thanks for the support though!

Sorry dude, one, I don't trust transactions outside of something that is garenteed for me to get my money back if I was to be scammed and two, I need more than 80$. Sorry bro, keep hold of it, BTC will rise past 4000$ by Jan :)
