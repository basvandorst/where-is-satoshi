Fuck all these haters man, I remember the other guy that that bought 50000 worth of bitcoin at the 250-500 range and people were calling him out. Some quick math says that if he bought in at 500, he would have purchased 100 bitcoins and if he only held 50 of them from 2014 to now, he would be worth 85,000 plus whatever he did or didn't sell. You do you man and sorry about your state of health

Did this guy seriously ask for donations for a mistake so blatantly stupid?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:28:11
And the answer is yes, yes it can my dear friend.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:55:47
Is it only credit or can it be debit as well? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:43:59
Hey man sorry for the vulgarity but FUCK TAXES!!!! Sell that shit on local bitcoins if you ever do and take the most profit. Screw the government, that's one of the reasoms why bitcoins were made for!
