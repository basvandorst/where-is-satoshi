Is this really true anymore with the state of mining now and the blockchain over 150 GB?

I just exported directly to GDAX. You'll get a better exchange rate there if you are wanting to trade BCH for BTC. Plus you can avoid some mining fees when you send the BTC back to your wallet.

I'm no finance expert so anyone feel free to correct me. I believe what the author is referring to regarding the systemic instability of modern  banking is that it is essentially built on a house of cards. As long as we all pretend that the banks and governments have money (or value) than everything works as it should. However, there can be times where the facade starts to crack and reality starts to show. When this happens people start to worry and things can come crashing down quite quickly. Not necessarily the value of the money, but the gears of the system itself can grind to a halt.
With Bitcoin, if people loose faith in it, then yes the price will fall, but the gears will keep turning. People will still be mining, even if much fewer than before.

This is because the block confirmation time of litecoin’s Blockchain is different than bitcoins. Bitcoins blocks are designed to be mined once every 10 minutes. Litecoin’s blocks are mined about once a minute (IIRC). This means that the time for your transaction to reach a certain depth is much less. Also it allows many more transactions per minute and allows your transaction to be added quicker from the pool of pending transactions.

I’m coming for you in 10 years when 1 BTC is worth $1 million.

As someone in IT, please don’t do this. I can imagine the confusion between Megabits/sec and how many megabits I own.

If 1 is subtracted from all non zero numbers in 00212121 the number would be 42 in binary

How are the BTC price fluctuations relative to your currency? Does the deflationary tendency cause you to want to not spend BTC?

Considering your initial position, I would guess you were decently well off before this.

The problem is that they don’t understand its value. You see it as an investment opportunity and that’s fine. But smart investors want to understand what makes their investments’ valuable, and what variables could change their value. This is what people don’t understand. 
You tell the: “it’s digital currency!”
And they say: “Like a credit card.
“No, it’s different. The actual money is in YOUR computer.”
“So why not just use a credit card?”

The problem isn't printing power. It's more about the actual productivity of the nation. How much does in export and how much does it need to import
