This is a couple different kinds of wrong.
That was an awful article, made almost entirely of gossip.  The only thing cited was was a truncated sentence from the hong kong economic journal that clarifies that HSBC has given the account holders 30 days to clear out the account.
They need to do this because the stated purpose of the account did not match how the account was actually being used. 
Joe Blow over there has a small business.   His small business has a bank account.
Joe Blow decides he’s going to accept donations for the protesters.  He puts those donations in his business account.
I dunno if Mr Blow actually gave the money to anyone or if he kept it, but HSBC noticed and said “no bueno, hoss, you have 30 days to move your stuff, we’re shutting you down”.   Because, you know, fraud.
So no.  This has nothing to do with politics or whether hsbc is china controlled or anything, it was ONE butthole exploiting a system.

1. The second post is two years old.  It cites prices that those investors are still bagholding on. $10k in November 2017 will not clear as a good investment compared to VOO until it breaks a 16% gain ($11,600).  It won’t break apple, MS, or google returns until roughly $16,000.  This says nothing of those poor souls who bought at 12, 14 or 17k.

Ever seen a frustrated guy swear at stuff?  He’s pitching a fit cause he’s about to die.  Or at least, that’s what he’s being told.  
When a lion on the savannah is about to eat you, activity in the amygdala (stress response) starts ramping up and activity in the ventral striatum (chill response) goes down.  These are two deep brain structures that regulate our responses to threats.  Unfortunately this is exactly the same thing that happens when uncertainty, whether restaurant directions or global issues, is introduced to a human brain.  (“Neural systems responding to degrees of uncertainty in human decision making”, *Science* 310, 2005, Ming Hsu)
The guy who made a fast decision and ran from the lion MIGHT live, but the guy who stopped to brainstorm escape routes *definitely* got eaten.  
Unfortunately, now we’re wired to make fast (survival) decisions based on little/bad sets of time/information. Because lion.  In a couple minutes, you’ll know THAT you were right...cause if you weren’t, after a couple minutes you don’t know much of anything anymore. 
In the first couple minutes after making a decision, your brain starts refusing to admit to the possibility of being wrong.  *According to your brain, oops=lion=dead...so being alive means you must have been right.*
So here we are:  *feeling* right is synonymous with *being* right.  Moreover, considering the possibility that we *only feel right* starts the terrible cycle all over again.  So our thinking gets hijacked...I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase “certainty bias” before.  There it is.  (Robert Burton, preface to *On Being Certain: Believing you are right even when you’re not*, St Martin press: 2008.)
Let’s go back:
- You suggested understanding law is not helpful for judging laws.  
- You suggested we should elect people with the least experience possible. 
- You suggested the healthy guy with the constitutional law degree and previous experience and a Nobel peace prize was a terrible person to lead the free world....BUT a guy with sexual misconduct, bankruptcies, tax evasion, fraud, who alienates allies and has bad health isn’t a bad leader.
Angry?  Why?  Which of the above statements is untrue?   
Different statements:
SET 2
- You suggest you live in the US
- You say you know about different cryptocurrencies
- You think the government spies on us.
**How big is that lion this time?**  Probably boring.  This time there’s little possibility of being wrong.  There’s no lion.
**You Are Angry And Threatened Because You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About.** And that’s okay.  We all do this, just like we all have warm blood and bones on the inside.
I’m not going to argue with you because you’re being chased by a lion. It’s a stupid idea. 
But you can read a book, Get more information.

No, but it establishes *when* you bought it, so they can estimate the taxes you owe based on the profit you made from it.
If it appears from thin air, you can still own/have it, you just have to pay the highest applicable rate on the full amount instead of just the profit.
Re: 
If you make $80k/year, bought a coin at SOME point that you can’t identify, and sold at $11k, they bump you up to the next income tax bracket, charge the full short term capital gains rate of 24% on the whole coin:  $2640.  (Hope you bought below 8).  Moreover, you now owe an extra 2% on the extra $10k income.
If you *can* prove you’ve had it more than a year and that you bought it $5k, though, that bill drops to $1650 and doesn’t bump you into the next bracket.  
Multiply that by someone who makes $100k, bought 10 coin at $1000 a pop back in the day, kept the record of purchase and sells at $20k:
LTCG= $28,500.  If he couldn’t prove when he got it?  STCG= $66,500.
When it hits $50k a coin, the difference in long and short starts getting into the hundreds of thousands.
**For those who aren’t ballin**
Yer lucky here.
**Hodl. Your. Damn. Coin!**
Your *long term* taxes are 15% prettymuch out of the gates, but they don’t hit 20% until after your coin profit *and* income combined break $400k. 
$150 in taxes for every $1000 gain.  That’s easy.  
If you think you are gaming the system because you’re “trading well”, your short term capital gains started the moment you made more than $10k.  That 10k isn’t just the coin, that’s also your burger flipping.
Let’s say you’re lucky enough to have a $35k job and you bought a whole coin back at $4k cause you’re a genius:  you better hang on to that bastard, cause you’re already bumped yourself up a whopping 10% in taxes.  If you sold *right now*....that coin actually pushed you over the line.   You didn’t double your money...you doubled theirs...from $3k in taxes to almost $6k.  You didn’t make $6k, you only made 3k. 
And the farther up you go, the worse it gets. “$100k coin!” And “no tracking!” is GREAT for the irs.  They get $20,000 for each one of those coins.

Okay, it sounds like the KYC laws jamming you up.   It takes a couple weeks before you "qualify" to do the immediate stuff.  
The steps (and hiccups) generally go the same on all exchanges:
\*open account
\*fund account (this takes a short forever, ranging from an expensive and limited immediate buy of only about $50 to very lengthy bank verifications of a week before you can start a transfer that takes another two weeks)
\*buy some coin.
\*leave some coin/cash on the exchange once it's cleared.  \*\* THIS is the thing that's making you nuts.\*\*  You don't have one of these set up.   This works as escrow...since fiat can be pulled back but coin can't, they want to see that you have enough funds cleared to cover the amount of coin you're buying.  It's akin to a crypto overdraft protection that you have to self-fund, and it's how the exchanges guard against nigerian princes.  Once you have this, all your other troubles go away.  
\*buy/move in the moment.  As long as it's within your semi-self-implemented limits.
fwiw,  I've seen/heard other traders having similar issues on non-american exchanges, too...having to send in bank records and id copies, the whole shebang.  They functionally remove all anonymity of you as a buyer...but with address cycling and simply moving the coin around you get back a certain limited amount of anonymity.

Except that they're suggesting it's cointegrated with hard assets like gold, and only put the one datapoint of gold on the chart, in spite of the paper saying that platinum/paladium/silver were bad parallels since they have industrial uses and gold is simply store of value.  
Except that gold is also industrial to a point in this technological world,  and gold can really only be \*measured\* as a store of value for the last hundred years or so (which involved the eradication of the gold standard being dropped and some fairly batshit inflation) and over the course of that hundred years, its production has only \*increased\* by year, not decreased.

Chill out sparky,
It’s being pitched by a noname, it only applies to stocks held, and it only applies to the top 0.3%.
What you should be concerned with is Bidens **40% estate tax if step-up is eliminated.**
For laymen:
If your parents buy a place for $500k, and in 30 years pass it on to you when they die, the current law is that it gets a “step up” to current value for YOUR tax purposes.  It is functionally your “bought” price.  If it’s worth $6M because it’s been 30 years and it has land on it, you can sell for $6M and not owe capital gains.  
(fwiw: my dad bought a place for $85k.  25 years later when he passed, it was 7 figures.  Numbers from my first home, my moms house and my brothers place are all very similar.  Heard all the buzz about REIT’s and real estate lately?  Now you know why.)
if that step up goes away, you don’t get to keep your family home unless you can cough up that 40%. 
Currently, any estate under $11.4 million is exempt *federally*, but that’s temporary, and the previous rate was $5M.  If this sounds like a lot, think again.  That’s the value of bank balances, stuff she owned, the house, stocks, retirement accounts, the whole lot.  If mom is anything like stable, she’s probably worth at least $2M.
But that’s fed. THEN you fight the states.
States still have their own tax rates, so if mom and dad had their place in, say, Massachusetts...you’re hosed.  They tax anything over $1M.   That’s not You Getting $1M, that’s Mom *leaving* $1M.  If mom had 3M and 3 kids, ya’ll get to split whatever is left over after Mass takes its cut.  
You don’t want to lose step up.  You *really* don’t.

These are issues you face when you aren't an established customer.   It's like a normal bank where you open an account with a gajillion dollars and get upset when you dont have a debit card RightNow and people look at you funny for trying to pay them $23,000 on a starter check.    
You're obviously new here, so here's a tip:   This doesn't happen when you aren't new here.   Also: buy yourself a hardware wallet (you can send immediately from those and you dont need to verify anything with anyone) and remember to be absotively SURE where you're sending your coin.   Cause when it's gone, it's gone, and nobody is giving it back to you.

“Public and tracked” And permanent...literally the whole point of blockchain.

It’s had futures markets for years.  Options too.
Daytraders are everywhere.  They also tend to short, which stabilizes downtrends.

N...no it’s not.  It’s the legalese required at the end of investment pitches so they can’t be sued for false advertising when they say  “18,20 or 22% returns on your investment”.
It’s usually a dead giveaway that dis-bubble-bout-to-burst.   
In bitcoin, it’s an admission that bit goes off its meds on the *regular*, so don’t put your rent money in here.  
It’s an observation that normal markets drop and spike for no reason at all under normal circumstances, let alone the unregulated and increasingly lucrative yet highly manipulated world of cryptocurrency.

Analyst says bitcoin goes through cycles and that this is a new one.  Says *nothing* about being parabolic, does not claim the big bull run is starting, does not hype. 
He *does* mention instances of business adoption of technology, the gains this year and the uptick in volume.
This is slow, steady build good news, NOT lambo news.
which is better.  
the slower we build, the more stable we build, the higher the number we “launch” from, the higher the gains and the higher the stability.

You gotta keep in mind that it doesn’t spike AT the halvening, it’s still at least 18 months out.
You also gotta realize the US is very likely facing a recession in that same time period, and nobody knows if that means bit will skyrocket...or if people will pull out and tank it.  They’re not likely to be dumping cash they need for rent into it, though.
We also don’t know that bit is going to moon, it may well have a barrier at 20k or 30k, maybe that IS the top.  Maybe not, but you can’t make that prediction.
What we do know is you have bills.
So stop buying now, while you’re able to without selling, and kill the debts.   Half of being rich isn’t about the amount of money coming *in*, it’s about preventing money from going *out*.

Of the ten years it’s been around, the only people who should be down are the ones that bought during the roughly 120 days that it’s ever been above current levels.  (Or those who willfully didn’t listen to LiteralllyEveryoneWhoKnowWhatTheyreTalkingAbout.)

TIL.  Neat!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:44:11
After price / before price = delta
Delta * purchase = current.
1500/1000 = 1.5
30* 1.5 = 45.
So $3k of coin bought at $5285 would be (roughly):
7470/5285 = 1.41
3000 * 1.41 = 4240.
Also:  see that 1.41?  That’s where you see your percentage.  If it drops below 1, you’re down. If it’s over 1, you’re up.
1.41 means you’re 41% up.
1.5 is 50% up.
263 is 163% up.
.8 is 20% down.

Yeah, more than one line is sort of needed or it’s pure malarkey.
Futures usually don’t do anything good for a market initially, and since part of bitcoins allure is its volatility, it won’t do anything “good” for us either. It will recover the initial hit and even out in the long run, though.

Okay, so the very long and short of it:  
There's this guy,  Sprecher, and he's an upstart that likes wrenching on cars because he likes fixin stuff that's broken.  He does this with money a bunch...starts with little bitty municipal funds, moves up to the euro zone, eventually decides to BUY the NYSE (like you do...).  
Somewhere back there, he meets this tall pretty chick at work cause she's friggin smart.  Puts a ring on it.
Hears about bitcoin and is like "dude...that's kinda cool.   And also a threat to banks and me...but...\*cool\*.."  
So he and his wife start doin research and see it start inflating and they're like "Get me some".  
Now being the owner of the NYSE (among other huge ventures, all of which are ridonkulously successful) he decides that while bitcoin is kinda kickass, the fact is that NYSE and NASDAQ and all the other guys run a gazillion transactions a minute.  Shit, they run a gazillion transactions a \*second\*.   Meanwhile btc is like "we..uh....we do 7."  
Looks like a broken engine to ol boy.  He's used to stock market speeds.  So stick a little more research into it, multiply the price banks pay to make a big transaction by the number of transactions, realize the kind of money at stake, and old boy is like "GET. ME. SOME."  
So now the dude who runs the intercontinental exchange has decided that maybe he should dip his toe into this thing.  Futures?  Sure...that's a nice start...but mostly for the sake of building something that is \*essentially\* the same thing as lightening.   He says so...he likes lightening.  
If you're not familiar with lightening, picture your house.   Your house has an IP...it's the one that lives on the router and faces the outside world, but it's not the same as the one on your computer.   Your \*computer\* probably has 192.168.0.something.   Mine does too.  Damn near everyones does...and stuff flies around INSIDE your house hella fast.  (If you're old school...you might remember LAN parties.   Those were a thing because trying to play online during dialup or satellite was \*painful\*)  Stuff flying between your computer and your buddies house?....not as fast. That's what bakkt wants to build.  A place to do fast stuff...it's really a LOT like lightening network.  
They want to build a great big infrastructure (house) that runs as DOW speeds (LAN) for transactions between big companies (Home Computers)  that move hella fast (Netgear NIGHTHAWK!) while institutions (Home computers) are trading, and the stuff that HAS to happen outside (I, an individual, sold my shares..gimme dollars)  the network (NIGHTHAWK) can do so at will without the whole works  having to grind down to bitcoin network (interweb) speeds..  
But...baby steps.   
Step one?  Marry a hella hottie with big brains.  (check)  
Step two...convince 100 of your closest and richest microsofts and starbucks's to join your lan party. (check)  
Step three...put hottie in charge of lan. (check.  srsly.  she's good.)  
step four....test with futures. (deposits begun the 6th.)  
step FIVE...okay.  Now We Play.
You are 17 days away from step four.

It bears mentioning that Sprecher and Loeffler took advantage of the $3k price slump in early 2019 to build their reserves and acquire companies that otherwise would have been out of reach to expedite the opening of bakkt.

To clarify:
Futures trading is a different beast than stock or coin trading.  It’s like options gone inside out: instead of trading a coin at its spot (right now price) like you see on Coinbase,
or trading a coin right now based on what you think the price will maybe be later on (options) 
it’s *inventing* a later on price that you’ll definitely pay later on.

Gold standard (iirc) usually meant it was kept in the federal reserve or fort knox or something, dollar was based on it.    If it’s adopted as currency, it can be, like, LOST lost.  So, Let’s say we win, and bitcoin makes its goals...Who would hold the keys, and how would that resolve with the “not your keys,  not your coin” I hear about?

This.  It will go down along with savings accounts, spending and health.  The only thing that will go up is debt and stress.
If you have a nugget in your pocket worth $10k and your car breaks when you need your job because your wife/roommate/parent lost theirs...are you gonna hold that nugget?  How bout if the baby needs diapers?
Recession will hurt it.
But if you hang on *through* that, and buy the dip (just like with stocks), it will come back.
Edit:  this is NOT to say anyone should sell *now*.   Selling now just means it gets devalued now, and later, instead of crashing 20% to 8k it will crash 20% to 6k or 5k or worse.  **Shore it up BEFORE the storm.**

Then I wouldn’t sweat it, people don’t like the fees and the purists don’t like the identification.  Fees you don’t need to worry about if you’re selling.  You just sell to the exchange (way easier) and you’re paid through coinbase directly and they take it from there, just log in to your account, check the bank you have attached, click button.
But people aren’t kidding...if you MUST sell, sell the absolute minimum humanly possible to eek you through, and rebuy with a quickness cause depending on when you bought, you’re going to get hit with capital gains tax on a small amount now, or you can make enough to not care about capital gains later.

Sure thing:
Bulls and bears.   When they encounter a threat, bulls will rush at it.  They go forward.
When a bear encounters a threat, they try to back off, they reverse.
A bull-market is what you’ve seen the last couple days...it’s charging forward (up).
A bear market/bear move is when it goes down, like now.
A “correction” is where you have a whole bunch of bull moves (a lot of up) and it drops for a minute....kindof like when you accelerate onto a highway, but you’re going too fast when you get there, so you tap the brakes to correct your speed.  
Sometimes people call themselves bulls....this means they’re super optimistic that things will continue to rise.  If you’re a bear, you believe it will go down in the future.
These are all stock market terms, and there are LOTS of them, (market cap, margins, DCA, Tons and tons of them) so you’re bound to run into more of them as we go along.  When you bump in to one you don’t know, feel free to ask again.

When it triples, I pull half my principal.
 
If it crashes, I hang on for the next rally...presumably about 12 months from the crash, give or take.
Ain’t sweating it.

You need to check with your bank first.  India is actively trying to shut out bitcoin and has locked many peoples accounts if they show transactions.

So much for slow and steady.

I get the feeling we’re going to have a second chance at a lot of prices.  dammit.

I’m bumping into major delays suddenly though it’s never been anything but instant before.  Not sure if it’s the queue or what.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:17:52
Amen.  A little stability would be nice.

May 12, 2 years ago:  $1800

On one hand, I get where you’re coming from.
On the other...$80 MILLION dollar *pizza*.

Because you’re not bringing good information to the crypto community, you’re bringing tired and watered down clickbait to the entirely uneducated who googled a get-rich-quick buzzword.
Because you’re an echo-chamber, a series of time-wasting videos that rehash the tl;dr’s of every article and tweet. 
Because you aren’t talking about blockchain technology, you’re talking about investments.  And you’re not talking fundamentals, you’re looking at a screen and saying “issa green candle” or “some people are bullish”.
Because the cartoonish font and “ZOMG!” and “Gosh, I’m Such a lost little lamb” expressions paste an uninformed and juvenile face on the front of something that was complicated *before* it was turned into currency...let alone after. 
Because you provide No Significant Quality Content.
Now go take a friggin decongestant, and read a book, and come back when you’ve grown up.

....we don’t care.

yeah, i dunno what he’s on about....
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:21:57
maybe the raspberry?

Lots of reasons exist that *could* be the spark.  What WAS the spark?  
Maybe the possibility of going to the stock market (looooots of big buyers there), or the stock market tanking (this might be safer than tesla).  Maybe the halving, or just everyone realizing that stable at $330 or so meant that WAS the bottom.  Maybe whole foods and millennials angry at wall street.
The *fuel* on the fire, though, is everyone yelling “holy jeebus, bitcoin!” all of a sudden.
I’ve noticed a buying spike at night where I am, daybreak out in Japan/china/australia/etc.   Maybe they know something about china’s market that we don’t.   Maybe they’re pumping it so they can sell at huge gains and run off with whatever we’ve all invested.
It’s bitcoin.
Explaining this thing is like trying to take a running fuck at a rolling donut.
The only thing that IS for sure?
It’s valuable, and it’ll settle high.
it was $100, spiked to $1100 and settled at $200’s.   Then it slowly doubled a couple times before it spiked to $20k, burst, and settled into high $3k’s.  
It’s rallying again.
It’s building again, hopefully slowly, and if it spikes/bursts, it’ll do so somewhere head and shoulders above the previous price again.  
So buy in.  Whatever you can afford to lose, don’t cash out any differently than you would for a 401(k), and hang on. If you buy it to use it, you don’t care what the price is.  If you buy it to hold it, you don’t care what the price is.  If you buy it to get rich quick, then godspeed....but at this stage, I wouldn’t sell till I saw it fluctuate many thousands in a single day.

Sounds fun, but i’m not a daytrader.   You might want to check out the price chat here, though...there are 2 or 3 guys over there that are fairly versed...one does forex trading, too.
They’ll be the first to admit that bitcoin does what it wants, but it’s a good learning area.  They’re a tad bullish, but history suggests that isn’t necessarily too far off the mark.

Thank You!
(if bitcoin rallys enough that i can take a little out, I’ll subscribe? )  :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:28:21
Ah, THATS what you meant.  I don’t think i own enough to have them on my own device *yet*,  but i’m getting there and plan to follow suit.
Thanks for the chat, though.  Took me second to catch up to what you were saying, but then it clicked, I was thinking on a totally different track.  My bad!  :)

When the price starts to fluctuate by thousands at a time in a day.
