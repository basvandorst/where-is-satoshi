I found this writeup more informative: [
Not making people pay capital gains tax for buying a cup of coffee would be a definite improvement :-)
The treatment of forks mentioned in this article also strikes me as entirely reasonable, whereas the current approach (every hard fork counts as income and must be taxed at the time of the fork---an impossible thing to track) is insane.
Sounds promising!

Originally it was $500,000 by end of 2020. Then in 2017 he upped it to $1 million by end of 2020.
I think he's in real trouble.

Nations could still have debts even if denominated in Bitcoin. And if denominated in a deflationary currency, they'd be all that much more difficult to pay off.

In two months we'll know that this is bullshit. We're already below the trend if you extrapolate between the July 2019 point and October 2019.

Without inflation, Bitcoin is a terrible currency for the US debt problem. Inflation is the friend of indebted nations.

Sweet. I was just recently pricing things out for down in Benton County, might get a bit warmer down there but similar electricity rates. I just am not sure the math works out, still---feels like you'd have to invest so much in hardware only for it to be obsoleted soon after when the difficulty increases. How long does a generation of miners tend to last you? (Of course, no worries if you don't feel like disclosing your trade secrets out in public here.)

You're pretty much crazy to only invest in crypto. Have a diverse portfolio: stocks, bonds, large, small, foreign, domestic, commodities, etc., with crypto as one part of that. Index fund ETFs make that sort of thing easy.

There are various startups trying to sell private "blockchains" (or ledger systems) to banks, not surprising banks are also attempting to develop their own. See for instance Transparent Systems.

I was specifically thinking of the high point in Dec 2017 as the recent Bitcoin bubble. I don't think Bitcoin is a bubble in general. To me a bubble is a situation in which the increase in valuation of an asset is the primary driver for future increases in valuation of the asset, rather than the underlying utility of asset ownership (for Bitcoin, the ability to transfer value across international borders, without permission, etc.)
Google and Amazon don't seem like a good comparison for at least the high point spikes in Bitcoin's history, because Bitcoin's bubbles "popped" whereas Google and Amazon have had sustained increases in valuation over a much longer period.

You might as well use shares of AAPL to buy your chicken tikka masala.... The IRS classification of these things is forcing the virtual currencies down a stock-like path when really they make more sense as currencies.

Essentially the entire stock market operates in a "not your keys" fashion. Nobody ever actually holds in their hands the stock that they own. It's all out on brokerages where you have an account. This works because these institutions are actually decent custodians of this stuff.

Unfortunately the current tax treatment makes that hard, at least in the US.

It just depends how far you take it. This sort of stunt has been pulled a number of times, and the first amendment gives a bit of leaway, but if you treat it very seriously, e.g. trying to assume law enforcement powers, not paying U.S. taxes, etc. you will get suitable pushback.

The American Civil War, World War I, and World War II, and the Korean War, and part of Vietnam all happened under the Gold Standard. The idea that a "sound money" currency would constrain war seems very questionable. The idea that it could limit the formation of bubbles may make sense... but then Bitcoin itself is one of the standout bubbles of recent history. I'm just not convinced that more or less inflation matters, so long as the rate of inflation is consistent over long periods.

It feels like in the old days when there was a big price move like today's, there would be abundant analysis of plausible factors driving the change, such-and-such announcement, this-or-that economic indicator. Nowadays it feels much more like this opaque movement. People have no real idea why the price is up 30+% in the past few months. That strikes me as a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:33:04
From that angle you could say that inflation is actually a corrective whereby the entitled voters of today pay more of their fair share, and that which will be paid off by the children of the future will be worth less and is thus easier to pay off.

The significance of this news is not that E\*Trade is providing anything novel---you obviously can buy Bitcoin through other venues. It's that it's E\*Trade, one of the biggest trading platforms at least in the U.S. Yes, anyone who already really wants Bitcoin has gone out and bought some. But this is for people on the margin---people who would do it were it convenient enough. By getting into E\*Trade, Bitcoin would instantly become more visible and convenient for millions of investors, and these are people who already have their money in this platform, huge sums, and that may be looking to diversify.

To make it profitable to spend $100 million to pump the price up by $800 would imply ownership of over 125,000 BTC, or 0.6% of all bitcoins to ever be mined.

Quality. A believable take on Bitcoin by somebody in a position of authority in the U.S. financial system. Interesting tradeoff he points out between a fixed supply and volatile price, or a volatile supply and fixed price.

A group can be "the only" things belonging to a particular class. "Canada, Mexico, and the United States are the only countries in North America." "Canada is one of the only countries in North America."
No need to pick this particular nit.

Okay, how so?
Here's how I'm thinking about it: let's say the value of the first chart at position i is x_i, and the value of the second chart at position i is y_i. Then we scale the x's and y's within the range of their min and max, and then add up the difference between the scaled x's and y's at each position i. That total difference will be relatively small.

He's basically emphasizing that the euro and Bitcoin derive their value and legitimacy from different sources. The euro gets a lot of its legitimacy from being the legal tender of a bloc of 340+ million people and the currency dispensed by the central bank. Bitcoin gets its legitimacy from its technical properties and the unique place it occupies in the crypto realm. His comments seem fairly reasonable to me, and I'd say it's mostly a good thing that the ECB doesn't see a need to regulate Bitcoin.

Okay, but versus a comparison of that first chart to a completely random dataset, it's pretty similar.

I'm aiming for the "sell half" strategy - get out partly when it's enough to make a difference in my life, but keep in partly to stay invested in a moonshot. No need to time things perfectly that way. Would have done well for me on the ATH, though that wasn't quite high enough for me to pull the trigger.
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:36:02
But come on... there really are some striking similarities between these two charts. They're not "entirely different"---they're actually highly correlated.

Ah, got it. To be honest I'm not sure what that specific language means, either :-/ "International payments getting processed by the New York Fed allows Department of Treasury oversight of international money flows" is my best guess at it, but that's still pretty vague.

He's basically right that the rise of Bitcoin would likely reduce the power of the United States to influence world trade through the dollar. But banning Americans from purchasing Bitcoin will do very little to change that. Far too late to "nip this in the bud".

It's the "first" but not the "only" digital object that is both quantifiably scarce and provably secure. Also, I'm not sure if there's an actual formal proof of it's security, might want to look into that.

I think he's referring to the petrodollars system where the U.S. got Saudi Arabia to sell oil in dollars. This forces countries around the world to seek dollars, making American trade deficits more viable and making the dollar the de facto reserve currency. See 
He's right that if bitcoin took over the dollar's role in global finance the United States would see a decline in its ability to control international trade. But banning Americans from investing in it is just going to make America's power that much less should that eventuality ever occur.
