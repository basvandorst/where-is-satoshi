Great questions.
 
I originally considered btcpayserver into the guide. Couple of points here:
1. whilst I have it manually deployed on my node, it does miss some features because it is not deployed using docker. the developers recommend the use of a docker instance.
2. btcpayserver is SO SO SO well documented and so is the use of manual deployment.  I don't think I'd do any justice by adding my own flair. 
As for RTL, this only works for the LND implemention of lightning network as of now. The developers are still in the process of developing this for c-lightning. I'm keen to get this going as well and I'll add it in as soon as a release is out.
LN node backup. Yep. This is a well known issue. Developers are working on potential solutions. I've got a disclaimer in my guide about this and I've recommended the use of quality hard drives. At this stage, no real solution.

Hey, whilst I do not have a solid answer for you, I do have an opinion. When I saw the bloatware that Windows 10 came with, I was a bit uneasy.
I would consider running Ubuntu only and if you really need to use Windows, you can install VirtualBox ( and you can install Windows on your Ubuntu machine using that.
I'd scrap the SSD memory stick idea and, depending how much coin we're talking, look into a hardware wallet such as the trezor or nano ledger for handling your wallet securely. I wouldn't recommend leaving it on your hard drive or SSD. If it's connected to the internet, it's an attack vector, so offline hardware wallets are well worth the investment and peace of mind.
Hope this helps.

I've actually linked that exact article in my guide as an optional step.

When do you anticipate Ku Band in Asia Pacific region to be made available?
If anyone in the Australia/NZ region has got this to work, let me know what hardware you used.

can you put a C-band LNB into a Ku Band antenna?
