I recommend you listen to Crack the Skye, it's by far their best album. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:37:15
I did, but the album leaked and now I'm tempted to listen to it.

@_date: 2014-02-25 21:21:35
When has there ever been good press about Bitcoin from major media networks? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:34:14
Who pays for porn?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:51:00
Or maybe this man really is Satoshi Nakamoto and he is just denying it like his brother said he would?
