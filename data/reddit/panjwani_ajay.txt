imo tether is what all cryptos ought to be like conceptually because forex markets discount everything and because fiat is pro govt so there is both stability and govt backing (indirectly)

it is actually a failure: that's always the point isn't it. the new guy comes in looking all shiny and you feel tempted to abandon what you're holding then you get a smack on your face when that guy can't keep up. yes decentralization is good but our stability lies with the reps the govt, crypto is tantamount to secession, never gonna happen.

It is easy to fall into a theoretical trap and regard Dimon &amp; Co to be static entities. In reality, they know exactly where to place themselves (or their replacements anyway)
Dimon &amp; Co are currently enjoying representing those who (rightly) regard crypto as a bunch of gobbledegook math but they are also prepared for when it gets physical and all

Bitcoin has two main purposes: (1) deflect dollar defectors from gold and silver (2) after accomplishing that, use governance issues to go down in value.
Yes, there is a roadmap for blockchains to take over trust infrastructure but not without centralization, which clearly defeats the purpose

The biggest challenge among human beings is how value gets stored or rather unstored
VALUE IS EVERYTHING
those is power want us to create value but never retain it, their method of choice:
BAIT AND SWITCH
This is the reason crypto in its present form has no future, it would be neutered as a value store
Very very deep thinking and an incredible brain is required to even grasp the complexity of the VALUE STORE problem
For instance, it is not just how my actions satisfy or dissatisfy which criteria of whom, it is how much leverage these bear because we represent hundreds of brands (gender, ethnicity, era, sun sign, family, heritage, the list is endless)
And we have not got into time decay even. Similarly when someone taxes us (not IRS, tax has a far deeper meaning), what are the reciprocities, where has person B (or rep) has paid person A (or rep) to justify the current tax or will settlement take longer or remain skewed 
Overall what is the inertia of a transaction, for instance we pay for a movie, we never pay for a part or get paid to watch some other part of that movie
What is the inflection in an event, we were bundled with other people, the food did not suit some people, others enjoyed it

Competitive devaluation requires all currencies to fail pretty much at the same time, so we might see some sort of currency apocalypse with mass exodus to crypto, the problem is that despite the crap that state money is, it would prove to be gold compared to the mess that cryptos would devolve into

my point was simply that: what could possibly unskew the apparently permanent skews in value transfer among human beings. to my mind, crypto in its present form is nowhere near addressing that problem

it costs 6k alone to mine, they are probably planning a shake up in mining, lower competition would centralize and waste reduction would centralize further, it would go into a death spiral to full centralization, bankers always want to discredit crypto visavis  fiat and bitcoin is their candidate, after the damage is done it won't matter, later on when cryptos take serious hold the second rung eth eos dash etc would benefit.

quote unquote spending is kinda like trading in a way, between btc, usd and coffee and you are optimizing your positions in each asset. if you think that btc would go down faster than usd, you shift to usd and if you think both would go down equally then you shift to coffee futures. microsoft and starbucks accepting btc is an indicator for wider acceptance of crypto but not necessarily that of btc so move more fiat to crypto (use market cap to decide the ratio) and if possible get a lower ratio of btc. with etfs, we would see fractional reserve hitting btc, read manipulation increasing manifold

the biggest issue in any transfer is variable exchange rates and this becomes acute if crypto is involved. there should be a mechanism where you authorize your family to spend from an account where the transfer happens on demand and buffers during favourable rates. in effect you are exploiting the fact that your family only needs ownership but not necessarily use of that sum of money and if this arrangement is a smart contract on a blockchain, it is guaranteed by the hashrate so you rest easy

ok here's the problem: how to preserve value or even grow it. if you own something, you own value. you need to secure the ownership to secure that value. but even then two things can happen (1) it can lose value by ageing or losing relevance (2) it can be taxed or need maintenance
when we hold cash, we let the govt safeguard it, but they do a shoddy job and keep diluting the value.
crypto is a bet that if transactions can be secured via blockchain then that alone could preserve value
neither cash nor crypto can help preserve value
the problem of preserving value is way too complex and political to ever get solved meaningfully  
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:40:34
i have come up with a solution that obviates the need for people to trust crypto or kit up on wallets because it uses crypto only internally. I call it circlebits but it is nothing unique. It is simply a two currency setup that can complete a transaction between the currency you want to spend and the one the cabbie wants to be paid in because other people are betting on exchange rates and earning interest by agreeing to be part of this transaction

@_date: 2017-08-13 21:55:31
your logic is faulty on two counts (1) fiat currencies go through competitive devaluation, exchange rate fluctuations merely mirror that competitiveness. essentially fiat can do so because automation creates value and that cant be passed on so fiat dissolves it (2) managing a currency is too tough a job esp if it is not fiat
think of crypto (as of now) as mp3 in a cassette world, napster used p2p for distribution but that didnt make it legal, much later itunes got it right
so slowly fiat would go and we might have some smart contract blockchain based store of value blessed by the govt itself
until then avoid serious investments in crypto

Money is anything of value that can be exchanged. It helps if it is standard. It also helps if it is divisible. But most of all it helps if the value it represents is inherent not denoted as there is no need to earn or maintain trust. So if there were state issued tamper proof standard gold coins of say a gram each then those would be a great form of money. A dollar is not backed by gold, but it is backed by trust won over many years of stability. So while it can lose all value suddenly, that would lay waste all the effort put into earning such trust. A big mac coupon or coin is also inherently worthless if McDonald's decides to withdraw the redemption offer or if the offer lapses on its own. In short both dollar and big mac coin can lose value suddenly but the latter is more likely to do so. If someone offers a dollar equivalent for the coin, go for it. That said, things are a bit more complicated. With denoted money you are able to participate in group logic scenarios. With trustless money, not at all. In the sense that with denoted money, you are trusting others to manage the real value (mostly it works against you but that's subjective).

I was essentially talking about Smart Contracts that could take Bitcoin to the next level in valuation. You're right that volatility is an indicator of the inefficiency of the system. But the OP is also justified in the sense that only because of volatility, do outsiders try to realign their take to insider level. They see smoke and try to locate the fire. In short, Smart Contracts is the fire that would make insiders create volatility which would be the smoke that alerts the outsiders to the next leg up.

The two are not comparable, fiat is not just a class, it has the most devilish connotation
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:54:23
My take is that Bitcoin is really just a proof of concept for the simple reason that ALL currencies HAVE to be FIAT. So after Bitcoin causes handling systems to mature, we would see fiat crypto take up those systems. Come to thing of it, crypto doesn't really solve any problem on its own. Inflation and all other stuff would remain. My guess is that crypto is just a container that can broad base currencies. Think of it as being the casino chips for the Net. Instead of conventional currencies contorting all over the place to handle Internet interactions, the plan is to let let crypto do that contorting because it is so new and flexible and later tie it to fiat (sort of like cashing in those casino chips)

Once Bitcoin SideChain comes into play, a lot of middlemen will likely lose their jobs
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:09:27
Speculation and volatility are simply a function of the difference between insider take and outsider take. My take is that Crypto is relevant because it is new and flexible enough to take on Internet interactions vis-a-vis fiat currencies that carry so much baggage. So the difference between insider and outsider takes could center around use cases imo. For instance, commerce is all about trust. Where there is lack of trust, a mutually agreed upon third party is employed. But third parties carry their own baggage in terms of fees and privacy. So it is possible that some genius comes up with a third party system using Bitcoin that requires keys from both parties ie escrow without escrow. Such a development could drive speculation and volatility because different participants would value it differently.

our world is sadly not about getting things done, it is about redistribution (getting the most while putting the least)
and even for maker net, there is no encapsulation so you are exposing top skill at rational rates (true graph is exponential ie skill reward is not linear)

war is not about finding who is stronger, it is to justify all the money spent on military (most of which is over invoiced)

sell bitcoin, buy eth, there would be panic then buy btc and sell eth (use crypto is for speculation, use pm for preservation)
in short wild times do crypto, stable times do pm

not true, do you buy all the stocks hyped by cnbc. the fight now is not about growing money, it is about preserving value. cnbc will never say get out of fiat or fiat denominated assets. some event like the yuan slide or lira slide can galvanize crypto adoption without any help from msm

there needs to be an intermediary that bunches transactions off chain so that circular ones get cancelled out, for instance. it would also allow smarter transactions eg if result is a spend aa, if result is b, spend bb then the remaining amount is circular

I think the main problem is taxation. The most common form of taxation is via inflation. One component is simple to grasp - the same $100 bill now buys less. The insidious component however is that because it makes more sense to convert the dollars to tangible assets, we tend to overdo the conversion. 
Bitcoin having a 21 mill cap does not make it inflation proof because it is not by fiat decree. then the only differentiator is the network effect. So if out of 10 merchants, 8 wont accept other crypto, bitcoin wouldve become fiat by decree in effect. Assuming Btc becomes that, we now face the spectre of competitive devaluation. in other words, all paper/crypto currencies that achieve fiat by decree status must also devaluate at the same rate. So one of two things has GOTTA HAPPEN (1) bitcoin does not become fiat (2) 21 mill limit is broken
