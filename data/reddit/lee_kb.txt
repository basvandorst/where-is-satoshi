Two problems with your statements, if I may:
1. Who would want this "lending crypto" that is presumably always inflating/going down in value? Given the choice, any rational person will want to keep all their value stored in something that is increasing in value. No one is going to convert their bitcoin into lendcoin so they can lend it out unless the potential gains exceed holding Bitcoin plus the value of the risk. Can't see that ever becoming a thing.
2. Everyone going bust, also seems unlikely. They will be paid less and less, but the value of their earnings will also increase apace, not to mention the value of their savings. No one's going to go bust.

1. You're correct, the trouble is, who is going to take one for the team by being the person holding that junk, inflationary, regularly debased currency if there are hard money alternatives like bitcoin available (assuming a post adoption scenario here)? The current system works because there is no viable alternative to inflationary fiat, but that paradigm is coming to an end. 
2. I don't foresee much lending going on in a post adoption world. Creditors will likely suffer during a major adoption run as the value of their loans decline, yes. Those with debt will have a field day as their fiat denominated debts decline in value. Anything traditionally paid for with debt will see some significant restructuring, to be certain. However, as pointed out in earlier parts of this post, economies did function just fine pre WW1 when the gold standard was still a thing.
Note that I'm more than happy to be proven wrong on any statement I've made.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:04:42
Just read your second point again. It looks backward to me. Debt is nominal, so if you owe 1 million USD and the USD drops in value because of crypto adoption, hey look, you now owe less "value". 1 btc you've been hodling might just pay off the whole thing.

Software lifespan is unpredictable and often shorter than you expect. If you care about your money, you'd be smart to keep abreast of changes in technology. You never know when a developer will abandon a project, or what hardware/network changes will suddenly cause an older app to cease functioning. Seed words are supposed to work across wallets but sometimes they don't. I imported a breadwallet seed into mycelium recently and got no love for whatever reason.

As you say, the people here are a tiny portion of the BTC user base. Most people probably wouldn't even notice a fork. Monero forks every six months, on schedule, no big deal. So forks aren't fundamentally bad. Don't worry, people have too much invested, financially and emotionally, to let Bitcoin die. And when you're feeling down, watch a talk by Andreas Antonopoulos. He could make a dead cat get excited about Bitcoin.

They will also back the scaling solution that yields the most fee growth (ie on chain scaling) since, long term, block reward falls.

Looking forward to reading your book! I'm bored with sci-fi books that somehow think we'll still be using government currency in the future.
1. All transactions to and from every key are recorded for all to see on the blockchain, so yes. It's just not immediately clear who controls those keys and what was exchanged for the funds going in/out.
2. Yes. In fact this is turning into an industry. See recent news about Bitcoin-related arrests in the Netherlands.
3. This is called a mixing or tumbling service. The simplest form of this is, people get together and pay money into one or more addresses, and then amounts are payed back out to different addresses and different amounts such that participants get their money back but it's not clear which addresses belong to whom. One cryptocurrency in particular, monero, solves this problem by using a form of mixing on every single transaction, thus making tracking of funds virtually impossible.

Once you change PoW you are now running on general purpose hardware and trust me governments have plenty of access to that. Further changes of PoW aren't going to be effective because now that everyone's on general purpose hardware, the attacker can change as fast as legitimate miners.

Well I can at least confirm an HD wallet seed generated by Breadwallet will not restore your funds on Mycelium (both Android). Just tried it for fun.

@_date: 2017-01-27 00:51:01
No, although correct me if I'm wrong. Most wallet providers use their own set of seed words, so it's not possible to restore an HD wallet in another wallet app/program. That said, I've heard that there are a few that do use the same schema, but you'll have to Google it.

Hardware wallets are cool but my paranoid mind can't help but think that hw wallets are super attractive to long-game hacking, whereas general purpose hardware like phones and laptops aren't as obvious a target. So it's a choice between small attack surface (hw wallets) or less enticing attack surface (general purpose hardware). That said, for people with average interest/inclination in IT security, ie almost none, hw wallets are probably best.

We're indeed in early days so scaling/usability issues aside, given the choice of keeping all your money in deflationary or inflationary currencies, rational actors will choose deflationary just the same way they'll choose the bank whose accounts give the best interest. That coin may not be bitcoin, but I can't imagine many people choosing inflation. It's forced on us now. No one wants their wealth to diminish over time for no reason. Except for borrowers and I expect interest rates to adjust to compensate for this economic change.

First, congrats and welcome. Second, people need to start calling it what it is: selling fiat is a big ordeal! And it's just going to get worse. As cryptocurrencies continue to increase in popularity and easy of storage/use, and banks and regulators start making things more difficult in order to protect legacy currencies and banking services, selling your fiat for bitcoin etc. is going to become near on impossible. That's what's truly going to drive the price up. People ceasing to be willing to give it up for fiat. People keep saying huge amounts need to be invested to bring the bitcoin market cap higher but actually all that needs to happen is for people to start saying no thanks when offered fiat in exchange for crypto.

As for backups, KeePass has a feature in the advanced tab of every password where you can create an rtf attachment. Perfect place to stash 2fa backup codes. Backups are a major pitfall of things like Google Authenticator.

Comment deleted but I assume it mentions it's against Google's TOS. I've had nodes running on Google compute that got shut down and appeal denied because it was "mining". It was Monero though.

Well for one thing housing prices would appear to fall because demand would fall due to easy mortgage money disappearing. Housing prices today are inflated thanks to the relatively ease of borrowing money.

Actually I doubt that. I happen to live somewhere where people save like crazy and buy houses, cars, etc. with cash一they're gonna love bitcoin. Just because bitcoin encourages saving doesn't mean people become Scrooge McDuck. You can't take it with you! ��

This is a myth. If no one can afford it, demand will decrease. Falling demand brings falling prices until people can afford it. Problem solved.

Transaction fees. Even today transaction fees are a significant part of mining (ie transaction verification) income.

That is indeed a pitfall with community based projects like Bitcoin and (broadly) Linux, etc. There's no company with a profit motive making sure everything is tight and tidy. I'm sure the people who made that wiki have largely forgotten about it and moved on to new things. Anyway hopefully your current problems will get worked out!

@_date: 2017-05-10 10:58:05
How fees are determined is fairly complex and relate mostly to scaling--ie if the network can only handle a given number of transactions per hour, there will be competition among users to get their transaction through. Miners meanwhile have incentives to choose transactions with bigger free over low fees. Fees are high now because scaling solutions are being delayed by miners for a variety of (controversial?) reasons. However it's a free market, so if bitcoin fees never go back down, other coins will become popular for small payments.

Let's say I give you 1 e-coin (just an imaginary digital coin for this example), then turn around and give the same e-coin to another person. That's a double spend. Since they're digital things, there was no way to guard against this kind of copying until ... bitcoin, which works using a public ledger that everyone agrees on which shows what coins are held by who and gets updated every time they are spent (aka a blockchain).

Backup your phone wallet's seed the same way as your hw wallet seed? Simple enough. And make sure Android device manager is on so you can wipe your phone remotely if stolen. I'd say in that sense it's even better than a hw wallet because it's less possible to perform offline attacks.

The US is mired in a variety of other problems which makes it a bad example, imo. A nice standard to go by is infant mortality (globally), which is way down and always falling lower. This seems to indicate your idea that there's some natural world phenomenon where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is flawed. Yes, rich Americans have leveraged off-shore manufacturing and outsourcing to increase their wealth while average Americans seem to be left behind, but this activity has created huge wealth for average people in less developed countries world-wide. So Americans need to seriously broaden their perspectives when whining about who's getting richer and poorer.

"Big league" vendors like Amazon are actually just platforms now. Half the stuff they sell is actually sold by independent sellers. Those sellers can just as easily sell on OpenBazaar.  Heck they can even fullfil those orders using FBA!

There's more to"self interest" than simple financial gain. Who knows what drives him. Even Satoshi created bitcoin entirely for free and with no expectation of financial reward. (Ok so in theory he's mad rich today but from a 2008 perspective it would have been hard to imagine making a billion dollars from bitcoin).

Block time is controlled through mining difficulty. This difficulty is adjusted all the time. Block time is also just an average time it takes to compete an essentially random process, which is how the mining algorithm works.
Nothing is "wasted" here because the work done secures the network simply by virtue of needing to be done. If bitcoin didn't have all this work being done, very little effort would be required to compromise the network. As it is, to cheat or break the network you need to do more work than half of all miners combined. That's very difficult to achieve.
That's a very simple overview. Mining is a pretty complex thing and testament to Satoshi's genius.

You make good points but don't forget Amazon and other places that only accept credit cards can only serve the minority of people on this planet who have credit cards. I'm not saying you are doing it, but I keep seeing people in the crypto space who forget about how most people on Earth live. They don't have good money, good banks and good government. There are billions of people who will be very interested in bitcoin when it arrives on their doorstep.

Not an issue at all. Paper wallets have to be swept or you lose the change, so once you scan the QR code, the wallet is emptied and should be disposed of permanently.

"Trusted party wallet" might be more accurate. Wallets where your keys are held by someone else. Or you can look at it this way: you are party 1, the web browser is party 2, and blockchain.info is the third party. The fewer parties there are the better so (until people start reviewing wallet source code or coding wallets themselves then) there will always be a semi-trusted component in any wallet setup.
