So, you compare a mythical figure that disappeared 8 years ago and holds a fraction (because 7% isn't much more than a fraction) of the overall BTC with a corporate for profit company that is backed and endorsed by banks (the literal evil crypto wanted to fight) that holds more than 50% of a virtual currency which is not even a crypto?

I did something similar... I went all in on the XLM/IBM  news, then it was going all the way down and additionally I lost 2FA access. Instead of sending the requirements to get 2FA removed so I can log in again, I just checked the chart every now and then to protect myself from 'weakhandselling'.
For comparison, this was the state of my trades at the lowest point, averaging a loss between 50 and 67% for each open trade: 
This was near the last high (not the top though): 
Since I didn't have access I couldn't sell at that top (6 hours earlier and I could have though) but it's just showing that sometimes you just gotta lean back. If you follow the advice of never investing more than you are willing to lose, there is no reason to panic as in the long term it'll always go up.

If that's not a lot of power already, I don't know what is. I doubt that a lot of people that have genuine ideas but are not fond of backing by venture capitalists/angel investors are likely to take the risk of getting jailed because the SEC wants to protect the rich.
That was my initial comment and it stands as it is. The SEC is trying to regulate ICOs as securities which makes it illegal to raise (big) money from US investors except they are accredited investors (1 million net worth).

Basically correct, just one more thing: the user won't hold their private keys.  The app will be a "bitcoinbank" that manages their accounts-balances (because it will serve more than only BTC) off-chain. I'm only wondering why the big exchanges aren't yet at that stage. But I think user to user transfers on coinbase are already off-chain, instantly and fee-less. That's how it starts.

The thing is that in a lot of countries it costs a lot to buy BTC. Usually 5-10% on top of the actual rate, sometimes even more. So simply replacing the BTC you spent will make whatever you bought more expensive by the cost you had to pay to acquire new BTC.

Interesting thought, however most banks are anti-crypto so this would probably cause a lot of problems also in regards to money laundering and "terrorist financing". You could make up contracts/bills that the other party pays while using a third party to handle the transaction.
If there was a service for this, it would be easier when both parties have an account and send it from there. Basically like a Paypal for crypto.
No matter what, they would need an account with the third party(website) anyway because of KYC/AML.

The problem with some people in crypto is that they are arguing "this or that". There is no in between, no compromise. They think crypto as it is will replace FIAT over time.
That's not how this will work. There will be a transition phase, adoption will be through a mixture of old and new. Remember that 50% of people are stupider than average. These (and more from above average) will never use crypto as it is.

As I read it, he made a good amount of money mining bitcoin and cashing out in 2013. He bought 200 Euro worth of Doge (hardly much) that went to 10-20x worth. He has a house worth 300,000 Euro about to be sold and his father a professional football player just died (inheritance?).
He then proceeded to change everything into bitcoin and should be in the positive right now as we are going for an ATH. Also it's a DECISION to live the way they do. Being able to travel the world for 9 months is not coming from nothing either. I mean... he probably has a few hundred thousand in bitcoin right now, he's not poor and can exchange at any time if he needs something. This thread is full with idiots.

I would spread buying over time for dollar average cost. Buy BTC daily worth 10k for a month. If it dips down, you got it a little cheaper, if it goes up you got it a little more expensive but in the end you get all your 300k worth in BTC.
I would wait for 2X though, many expect a lot of volatility during that time, most probably a correction of the BTC price and a run for cheap alt-coins.
We have a BTC dominance of almost 54% right now which hasn't been this high for some time. There will be a correction back to 47-48% of BTC dominance which will reflect on it's price obv.
I would also consider spreading the investment to alt-coins. If it was my money, I would buy alt-coins right now, then wait for 2X, then after the BTC correction change the (now higher priced alts) into BTC. Could turn the 300k into 500k+ in 2-4 weeks.

What you need is to offer business es options. Let them decide if they want to exchange to Fiat before payment (Bad for customer), accept crypto at market value (fair for both) or trade as if they buy the crypto from the customer (incentive for the customer to conduct business with them instead of competitioner).

They are feeding off of this. Either because you were way up before, or because they are too pussy to take the risk and fear that you will be way up one day. To prevent that, they try to get you out instead of getting in themselves.
Your family is shit and you should look for new friends if that's how they support you.

You do understand that financial institutions make billions corrupting the system, pay tens or hundreds of millions as fines while keeping the rest as profit and have plenty of other stuff they get away with?
Now think this is an institution like that. They short bitcoin and then sell off their stash. They will make far more shorting it than they would make if it goes up AND they basically eliminate a looming threat.
They can also buy again low (even more with less investment) after pushing it down and repeat.
