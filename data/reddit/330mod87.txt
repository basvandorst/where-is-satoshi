That is a rabbit hole you don't want to go down. You could just keep increasing it until you need 1Gbps upload average to run a node. That is the very definitely of centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:58
Visa and mastercard combined do roughly 2k transactions per second. 
If we future proof it to 4k tx/sec, and bitcoin stays at 3.3 tx/sec, we should just get it over with and increase the block size by 1213x for 1.2GB blocks.
That will solve our problems ^/s
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:42
Oh hey, we increased the IP "block size" by 4x. Let's go from 2^8000000 to 2^9704000000 that will solve everything!

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:49:56
We have the same vision. I am full support for block sizes that are feasible for the average person to maintain. As our average bandwidth speed has increased, so should the block size. However, I am not for ONLY raising the block size. It should be in conjunction with another solution. For instance, when LN is integrated into mainnet, block size should adjust appropriately. Hard forks should be avoided at all costs, because there will be people that stay behind. So if we are going to hard fork, it needs to be the right solution. 
The only thing we disagree on is before or after LN integration. We can't even get people to adopt segwit en mass.

if we consider a best case scenario of node propagation, we can assume transfer speed is linked to the a 2^n correlation
One person uploads to one person - (2)
Those two people upload to two more people - (4)
Those four upload to four more - (8)
... etc
Current bitcoin node count: 8860 
2^15 = 16384.
In this best case scenario, equal upload and download speeds of all nodes, with each node only uploading to one other node, it would take 14 hops to distribute that block across the network.
Now 10 minutes is the average time to shoot for, but sometimes blocks are found withing a few minutes. Let's say we want blocks to be fully distributed by 2 minutes to avoid nodes not knowing the previous block by the time a new block is found.
2 mins = 120 seconds
120 seconds / 14 hops = 8.5 seconds/hop
8.5 seconds * 22.79Mbps / 8 bits/Byte =  24.4MB max.
this is the best case!
What if each node is uploading to 2 at the same time? What about 3?
1-&gt;2 takes 9 hops, 120/9 = 13.3s/hop, 13.3s/hop * 1 hop/2 nodes = 6.65s/node * 22.79Mbps / 8 = 18.9MB max
1-&gt;3 takes 7 hops, 120/7 = 17.1s/hop, 17.1s/hop * 1 hop/3 nodes = 5.71s/node * 22.79Mbps / 8 = 16.3MB max
1-&gt;4 takes 6 hops, 120/6 = 20.0s/hop, 20.0s/hop * 1 hop/4 nodes = 5.00s/node * 22.79Mbps / 8 = 14.2MB max
Imo, keeping things decentralized should be the driving factor. Yes we need a block size increase.. to maybe 2/3/4MB, but no more than that until the average uploaded speed can safely and SECURELY handle it. A 10MB block is living dangerously close to our maximum currently.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:59:17
You also have to consider the average internet speed to transfer these blocks. Average upload speed in the US was 22.79 Mbps in 2017, but I'm not sure what that includes. My comcast plan only nets me 15Mbps upload, with 250Mbps down. Each node needs to stay up to date within the time of the next block mined or we risk orphaning blocks/forks. Imo, it's not about size, but about speed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:37:23
It's not about one person. It's about how long the data travels across the entire network (currently 8900 nodes)
Or 8.9GB every block.
Also if you read my other reply, I explain how the limit is around 10MB

Thats like saying dollars is useless because of fluctuations  in the euro. A currency is something that common people value as an exchange of wealth. If you entirely lived your life in bitcoin day to day price changes don't matter because one loaf of bread is still going to be 0.0005 btc

Each "coin" is divisible into 100M satoshis. Just like there's 100 cents in 1 dollar.
That comes out to 21000 Trillion satoshis to be used amongst everyone in the world. Even that is kind of small, which could potentially be broken down into even smaller units pending a soft fork.
There's also other layers that can run on top of the blockchain. Read up on the lightning network. It's like currency squared.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:36:22
You invest with emotions? Bitcoin is not for you. You need balls of steel.
So what if it drops 10% tomorrow. $100 is not your full anticipated position. In this case, $1000 could be. Which means now you have $900 to buy in. The inverse is true too. What if it rises 10% and you still "didn't get in early enough"
But that case is covered, because you are in. Even though it's only $100.

It's only less profitable if you sold at that exact moment.
One could argue it was less profitable to mine BTC while BCH was ~$300 and dump it when it spiked.
But no one can tell the future, so.
During that few hour stretch, most miners who switched from BTC to BCH ultimately made less. It's unlikely any of them could have sold their fresh coins in time.

It's more likely that someone finds an exploit in the hashing algorithm itself. It that happens, then SSL/TLS breaks as well. All internet traffic would be unsecured.

Also, why would you not just buy $100 of Bitcoin here and there. I'm sure $100 isn't a lot to you. But it's enough to start accumulating a position. Unless you are day trading.

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:07
SHA256 can't be brute forced for collisions. 2^256.
However, if someone finds an exploit, it's more likely that it only affects the 256bit key size. 256 would likely be targeted because it's used in SSL certs and bitcoin. Changing that key size to 384 or 512 bit is likely to not suffer from the same exploit as 256. If it does, SHA-3 will be developed with a patch to the exploit.

Transactions are included in blocks because miners get the fees in addition to the block reward. No transactions, no Bitcoin. Miners ONLY purpose is to hash these transactions into the next block. That's the core of how Bitcoin works. Miners are just competing to see who gets to get the reward from the work they've put in. It's not just random hashes.
It's fairly complex. YouTube can explain it better than I can. The possibilities are endless though.
